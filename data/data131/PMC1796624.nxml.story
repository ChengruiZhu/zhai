The conventional view is that DNA carries all of our heritable information and our genes control development into adulthood. The discovery of epigenetics, a term coined to describe effects that are not coded for by DNA sequence, but can nonetheless affect our development and well-being, has added another layer of complexity to our understanding of genetics. One class of genes under epigenetic control are imprinted genes. Mammals inherit two copies of every gene, one from mother and one from father, and in most cases, both are active. However, for a small number of imprinted genes in mammals, only one is active, either the maternal or the paternal copy. Epigenetics amounts to a control system for switching genes on and off appropriately. We focus on a group of little-studied imprinted genes that share features that give clues to their evolutionary origins. These so-called “retrogenes” are protein-coding sequences of DNA that have undergone duplication and jumped into novel locations in the genome. Because of this, it is possible to determine where, and roughly when, many of the imprinted retrogenes originated. This provides an opportunity to study the molecular events that have generated imprinted genes during mammalian evolution.
