Although beneficial effects of non-secreting intracellular renin (ns-renin) against ischemia have been reported, the precise mechanism remains unclear. In this study, we investigated the roles of ns-renin and mitochondrial extracellular signal-related kinase (ERK) 1/2 on mitochondrial permeability transition pore (mPTP) opening during ischemia in diabetes mellitus (DM) hearts. When isolated hearts from Wistar rats (non-DM hearts) and Goto-Kakizaki rats (DM hearts) were subjected to ischemia for 70 min by left anterior descending coronary artery ligation, DM hearts exhibited higher left ventricular (LV) developed pressure and lower LV end-diastolic pressure than non-DM hearts, suggesting ischemic resistance. In addition, DM hearts showed increased intracellular renin (int-renin, including secreting and non-secreting renin) in the ischemic area, and a direct renin inhibitor (DRI; aliskiren) attenuated ischemic resistance in DM hearts. ERK1/2 was significantly phosphorylated after ischemia in both whole cell and mitochondrial fractions in DM hearts. In isolated mitochondria from DM hearts, rat recombinant renin (r-renin) significantly phosphorylated mitochondrial ERK1/2, and hyperpolarized mitochondrial membrane potential (ΔΨ
