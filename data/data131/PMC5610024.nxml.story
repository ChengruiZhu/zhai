High-mobility group box 1 (HMGB1) is an abundant protein in most eukaryocytes. It can bind to several receptors such as advanced glycation end products (RAGE) and Toll-like receptors (TLRs), in direct or indirect way. The biological effects of HMGB1 depend on its expression and subcellular location. Inside the nucleus, HMGB1 is engaged in many DNA events such as DNA repair, transcription, telomere maintenance, and genome stability. While outside the nucleus, it possesses more complicated functions, including regulating cell proliferation, autophagy, inflammation and immunity. During tumor development, HMGB1 has been characterized as both a pro- and anti-tumoral protein by either promoting or suppressing tumor growth, proliferation, angiogenesis, invasion and metastasis. However, the current knowledge concerning the positive and negative effects of HMGB1 on tumor development is not explicit. Here, we evaluate the role of HMGB1 in tumor development and attempt to reconcile the dual effects of HMGB1 in carcinogenesis. Furthermore, we would like to present current strategies targeting against HMGB1, its receptor or release, which have shown potentially therapeutic value in cancer intervention.
