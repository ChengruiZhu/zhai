The aim of this study was to evaluate the survival of single- and two-surface atraumatic restorative treatment (ART) restorations in the primary and permanent dentitions of children from a high-caries population, in a field setting. The study was conducted in the rainforest of Suriname, South America. ART restorations, made by four Dutch dentists, were evaluated after 6 months, 1, 2, and 3 years. Four hundred seventy-five ART restorations were placed in the primary dentition and 54 in first permanent molars of 194 children (mean age 6.09 ± 0.48 years). Three-year cumulative survivals of single- and two-surface ART restorations in the primary dentition were 43.4 and 12.2%, respectively. Main failure characteristics were gross marginal defects and total or partial losses. Three-year cumulative survival for single-surface ART restorations in the permanent dentition was 29.6%. Main failure characteristics were secondary caries and gross marginal defects. An operator effect was found only for two-surface restorations. The results show extremely low survival rates for single- and two-surface ART restorations in the primary and permanent dentitions. The variable success for ART may initiate further discussion about alternative treatment strategies, especially in those situations where choices have to be made with respect to a well-balanced, cost-effective package of basic oral health care.
