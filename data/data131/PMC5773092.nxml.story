We developed predictive gene signatures that identify specific histological mouse mammary tumor subtypes with high fidelity to expert pathologist classifications. As a result, these signatures are a powerful tool for classification, particularly in cases of intratumor heterogeneity; where confounding results arise from differences in the tumor portions sent for pathology and separately for molecular analysis. Further, we show that despite differences in the tumor initiating oncogene, histological subtypes in mouse mammary tumor are unified in their transcriptomic profiles and activation of cell signaling pathways. We find that these transcriptomic profiles and activation of key signaling pathways are not only conserved in human breast cancer, but also other human cancer types. Further, the EMT, Adenomyoepithelial and Solid signatures were prognostic in specific human breast cancer subtypes. Indeed, this work provides a new and needed perspective on how mouse models relate to specific human breast cancer subtypes by showing that the tumor histology of the mouse mammary tumor is far more important than the initiating oncogenic event in terms of how the mouse mirrors a specific human subtype.
