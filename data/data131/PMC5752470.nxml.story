The oncogene B-cell lymphoma 6 (BCL6) is associated with lymphomagenesis. Intriguingly, its expression is increased in preeclamptic placentas. Preeclampsia is one of the leading causes of maternal and perinatal mortality and morbidity. Preeclamptic placentas are characterized by various defects like deregulated differentiation and impaired fusion of trophoblasts. Its pathogenesis is however not totally understood. We show here that BCL6 is present throughout the cell fusion process in the fusogenic trophoblastic cell line BeWo. Suppression of BCL6 promotes trophoblast fusion, indicated by enhanced levels of fusion-related Î²-hCG, syncytin 1 and syncytin 2. Increased mRNA levels of these genes could also be observed in primary term cytotrophoblasts depleted of BCL6. Conversely, stable overexpression of BCL6 reduces the fusion capacity of BeWo cells. These data suggest that an accurately regulated expression of BCL6 is important for proper differentiation and successful syncytialization of trophoblasts. While deregulated BCL6 is linked to lymphomagenesis by blocking lymphocyte terminal differentiation, increased BCL6 in the placenta contributes to the development of preeclampsia by impairing trophoblast differentiation and fusion.
