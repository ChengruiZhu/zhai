A database of Prostate Cancer Proteomics has been created by using the results of a proteomic study of human prostate carcinoma and benign hyperplasia tissues, and of some human-cultured cell lines (PCP, http://ef.inbi.ras.ru). PCP consists of 7 interrelated modules, each containing four levels of proteomic and biomedical data on the proteins in corresponding tissues or cells. The first data level, onto which each module is based, is a 2DE proteomic reference map where proteins separated by 2D electrophoresis, and subsequently identified by mass-spectrometry, are marked. The results of proteomic experiments form the second data level. The third level contains protein data from published articles and existing databases. The fourth level is formed with direct Internet links to the information on corresponding proteins in the NCBI and UniProt databases. PCP contains data on 359 proteins in total, including 17 potential biomarkers of prostate cancer, particularly AGR2, annexins, S100 proteins, PRO2675, and PRO2044. The database will be useful in a wide range of applications, including studies of molecular mechanisms of the aetiology and pathogenesis of prostate diseases, finding new diagnostic markers, etc.
