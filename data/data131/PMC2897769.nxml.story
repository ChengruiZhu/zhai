These findings show that in Kilifi District, Kenya, hotspots of symptom-free parasitemia are stable over time but hotspots of febrile malaria are unstable. The researchers suggest that rapid acquisition of immunity in the stable hotspots reduces the occurrence of febrile malaria whereas in the unstable hotspots there is a high incidence of febrile malaria because lack of previous exposure to the parasite means there is a low level of immunity. Targeted strategies for malaria control should target both types of hotspots, suggest the researchers. Stable hotspots of symptom-free parasitemia (which can be identified by parasite or antibody surveys or by remote environmental sensing) should be targeted because mosquito dispersion probably increases malaria transmission rates near these hotspots. Unstable hotspots of febrile disease should be targeted to reduce both the burden of disease and transmission in the wider community. Unstable hotspots of febrile malaria, the researchers suggest, could be efficiently identified in Kilifi District (and maybe elsewhere) by determining which homesteads had malaria outbreaks during September (part of the dry season) one year and then focusing control interventions on these homesteads the next year.
