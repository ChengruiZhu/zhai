Global obesity and associated health issues have raised the significance of adipocyte biology. Adipose tissues are classified as brown and white adipose. White adipose tissues store lipids, leading to overweight, obesity, insulin resistance and Type2 diabetes. In contrast, brown adipose tissues use lipid storage to generate heat, increase insulin sensitivity, and are negatively correlated with the incidence of Type2 diabetes. Recent studies indicate that white adipose is plastic and contains an intermediate type of adaptive adipocytes (so-called beige/brite adipocytes) that have the energy-dissipating properties of brown adipocytes. Prdm16 is a key molecule that determines the development of both brown and beige adipocytes. Thus, Prdm16 represents a novel molecular switch that expands brown/beige adipocytes and increases energy expenditures. However, how Prdm16 is regulated has been unclear. Here we report that the microRNA miR-133a specifically targets Prdm16 at the posttranscriptional level. Inhibition or knockout of miR-133a significantly increases Prdm16 expression and the thermogenic gene program in white adipose tissues, resulting in dramatically enhanced insulin sensitivity in animals. Our results suggest that miR-133a represents a potential drug target against obesity and Type2 diabetes.
