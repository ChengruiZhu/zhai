Human cancer-associated UniGene sets (NCBI GeneBank) provide a platform for identifying differentially-expressed genes in human cancers. The present study identified and characterized a set of human cancer-associated genes using the Digital Differential Display (DDD) and functional analysis tools. A total of 1,904 genes were differentially expressed in 15 cancer types, including genes that had been previously shown to be specific in certain human cancers. A total of 274 genes were uniquely expressed in certain cancer types, including 37 genes that were highly expressed in the human testes and epididymis. These genes mainly functioned as ribosomal proteins, enzymes, receptors, secretory proteins and cell adhesion molecules. The most common domains that were encoded by the cancer-associated genes were those of cytochrome P450 CYP2D6, serpin and apolipoprotein A-I. A further gene ontology (GO) enrichment analysis revealed seven major functional clusters, which corresponded to the enriched pathways involved in cancer. The present study provides a source of cancer-associated genes and their functions. The results provide new insights into cancer biology and the involvement of highly-expressed epididymal genes in cancer biomarkers.
