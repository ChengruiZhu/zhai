To study the therapeutic effect of Armillarisin A on patients with ulcerative colitis (UC) and on serum IL-1β and IL-4, sixty patients with UC were randomly divided into three groups: Armillarisin A treatment group (Group I), Armillarisin-combined hormone therapy group (Group II), and hormones treatment as the control group (Group III). Patients in Group I received Armillarisin A 10 mg enema in 100 ml saline. Patients in Group II received Armillarisin A 10 mg and dexamethasone 5 mg enema in 100 ml saline. Patients in Group III received only dexamethasone 5 mg enema in 100 ml saline. The therapeutic efficacy and serum levels of IL-4 and IL-1β were observed. After 4 week treatment, the total effective rates were 90.0 % in Group I and 95.0 % in Group II. Both are higher than it in control group, which was 70.0 %. The serum levels of IL-4 in Groups I and II were significantly higher than it in control group. Compared to IL-4 levels before treatment, the levels of IL-4 after treatment were significantly higher in both Groups I and II. The serum levels of IL-11β were significantly decreased in Groups I and II in comparison to it in control group. Compared to the levels of IL-1β before treatment, the levels of IL-1β were significantly decreased. Armillarisin A shows a significant effect in treating UC. It helps increase IL-4 and lower IL-1β and the mechanism may be related to the body’s immunity regulation.
