Microorganisms are extremely abundant and diverse, and occupy almost every habitat on earth. Most of these habitats contain a complex mixture of many different microorganisms, and the characterization of these metagenomic mixtures, in terms of both taxonomy and function, is of great interest to science and medicine. Current sequencing technologies produce large numbers of short DNA reads copied from the genomes of a metagenomic sample, which can be used to obtain a high resolution characterization of such samples. However, the analysis of such data is complicated by the fact that one cannot tell which sequencing reads originated from the same genome. We show that the joint analysis of multiple metagenomic samples, which takes advantage of the fact that the samples share common microbial types, achieves better single-sample characterization compared to the current analysis methods that operate on single samples only. We demonstrate how this approach can be used to infer microbial components without the use of external sequence data, and to cluster sequencing reads according to their species of origin. In both cases we show that the joint analysis enhances the average single-sample performance, thus providing better sample characterization.
