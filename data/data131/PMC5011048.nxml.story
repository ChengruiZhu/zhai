Periostin acts both as an extracellular matrix protein belonging to the fasciclin family and as a matricellular protein functioning in cell activation by binding to its receptors on the cell surface. It has been established that periostin is a downstream molecule of interleukin (IL)-13, a signature type 2 cytokine, and that periostin plays an important role in the pathogenesis of allergic diseases, including asthma. Based on these findings, much attention has been paid to periostin as a biomarker useful in the treatment of asthma. Periostin is a surrogate biomarker for type 2 immunity; it has been shown that serum periostin can predict the efficacy of anti-IL-13 antibodies (lebrikizumab) and anti-IgE antibodies (omalizumab), and that this usefulness can be potentially expanded to other type 2 antagonists. Moreover, it has been shown that periostin is not a simple surrogate biomarker for type 2 immunity; periostin-high asthma patients have several unique characteristics, including eosinophilia, high fraction of nitric oxide, aspirin intolerance, nasal disorders, and late onset. These characteristics are likely to be correlated with the involvement of periostin in the tissue remodeling of asthma. Periostin is also associated with hyporesponsiveness to inhaled corticosteroids, probably reflecting tissue remodeling. Thus, periostin has 2 characteristics as a biomarker for early diagnosis of asthma: surrogate biomarkers for type 2 immunity and tissue remodeling. Based on these characteristics, we will be able to apply serum periostin to treatment of asthma.
