The amygdaloid complex is one of the key brain structures involved in fear-related processes. A typical way to study neural correlates of fear expression (e.g. freezing response) in the amygdala is to perform a fear conditioning paradigm, which yields a conditioned fear response. This response can be reversed by another procedure called fear extinction. Thanks to the experimental approaches to date we have some understanding about the putative roles of specific subnuclei within the amygdala in the formation of these fear and extinction memories. Here, we complement the experimental studies by providing a computational model that addresses the question of how fear and extinction memories are encoded in the amygdala, and specifically, in the basal nucleus (BA). We propose a specific neural mechanism to explain how the BA may integrate information about a salient, conditioned stimulus and the environment, thereby enabling it to switch the state of the animal from low to high fear and vice versa. We also provide possible explanations for various other behavioral findings, such as the recovery of fear after it had been extinguished (renewal). Finally, we make specific, experimentally testable predictions that need to be addressed in future work.
