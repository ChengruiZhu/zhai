Megavoltage cone‐beam CT (MVCBCT) is an imaging technology that provides a 3D representation of the patient in treatment position. Because it is a form of x‐ray tomography, MVCBCT images give information about the attenuation coefficients of the imaged tissues, and thus could be used for dose calculation. However, the cupping and missing data artifacts seen on MVCBCT images can cause inaccuracies in dose calculations. To eliminate these inaccuracies, a correction method specific to pelvis imaging and based on phantom measurements has been devised. Pelvis‐shaped water phantoms of three different sizes were designed and imaged with MVCBCT. Three sets of correction factors were created from the artifacts observed in these MVCBCT images by dividing the measured CT number by the predefined CT number for water. Linear interpolation is performed between the sets of correction factors to take into account the varying size of different patients. To compensate for the missing anatomy due to the limited field of view of the MVCBCT system, the MVCBCT image is complemented with the kilovoltage CT (kVCT) image acquired for treatment planning. When the correction method is applied to an anthropomorphic pelvis phantom, the standard deviation between dose calculations performed with kVCT and MVCBCT images is 0.6%, with 98% of the dose points agreeing within
