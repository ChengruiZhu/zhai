Computed tomography is commonly used in modern medicine, and thus, it is often helpful for medicolegal purposes, especially as part of the antemortem record. The application of postmortem computed tomography and 3D reconstruction of the skull in challenging cases is reported, and its valuable contribution to positive identification is discussed. This paper presents a case in which the body of an unknown individual is identified. Positive identification had not been possible despite a multidisciplinary examination. The postmortem use of computerized tomography and 3D reconstruction of the skull followed by the comparison of individual morphological characteristics of the viscerocranium showed the concordant points between the deceased and a missing person. Finally, superimposition using a 3D-reconstructed skull instead of the skeletonized skull demonstrated an adequate degree of morphological consistency in the facial images of the analyzed individuals that lead to positive identification. It was concluded that where other methods of personal identification had failed, the use of postmortem computed tomography had proved to be instrumental in the positive identification of the deceased.
