Carbon nanotubes (CNTs) filled with iron sulfide nanoparticles (NPs) are prepared by inserting sulfur and ferrocene into the hollow core of CNTs followed by heat treatment. It is found that pyrrhotite‐11T iron sulfide (Fe‐S) NPs with an average size of ≈15 nm are encapsulated in the tubular cavity of the CNTs (Fe‐S@CNTs), and each particle is a single crystal. When used as the anode material of lithium‐ion batteries, the Fe‐S@CNT material exhibits excellent electrochemical lithium storage performance in terms of high reversible capacity, good cyclic stability, and desirable rate capability. In situ transmission electron microscopy studies show that the CNTs not only play an essential role in accommodating the volume expansion of the Fe‐S NPs but also provide a fast transport path for Li ions. The results demonstrate that CNTs act as a unique nanocontainer and reactor that permit the loading and formation of electrochemically active materials with desirable electrochemical lithium storage performance. CNTs with their superior structural stability and Li‐ion transfer kinetics are responsible for the improved rate capability and cycling performance of Fe‐S NPs in CNTs.
