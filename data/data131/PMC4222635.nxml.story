The non-uniformity of DNA composition in mammalian genomes has been known for over four decades. Many attempts have been made to provide a concise description of this heterogeneity and to identify the evolutionary driving forces behind this compositional phenomenology. The first concise description of the genome suggested an isochoric structure according to which the mammalian genome consists of a mosaic of long, compositionally homogenous DNA sequences. With the advent of genome sequencing, this description was found to be inappropriate. We have recently proposed an alternative “compositional domains” model that depicts the human and cow genomes as composed of mixture of compositionally homogeneous and nonhomogeneous domains. Most of these domains are very short. Since its proposal, this model has been validated in plethora of invertebrate genomes. Here, we test the validity of this model on eleven mammalian and avian genomes using seven attributes of compositional domains and discuss their evolution. We also use these attributes to decide between two competing phylogenetic hypotheses. Our findings provide strong supporting evidence for the “compositional domains” model and indicate that rodents are not as close to primates as envisioned by the Euarchontoglires hypothesis.
