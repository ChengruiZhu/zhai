Programmed necrosis, or necroptosis, is a type of specialized cell death with necrotic characteristics, including the loss of membrane integrity and swollen organelles in dying cells. However, unlike simple necrosis, it may be induced as an alternative form of cell death when apoptosis is blocked and it is mediated in an orchestrated manner, similar to apoptosis, by a series of signaling molecules. Necroptosis-associated proteins and their specific small molecules have been extensively identified in order to illuminate the underlying mechanisms by which necroptosis is activated through a novel signaling pathway. However, the biological significance of necroptosis, which is known as a secondary route of apoptosis, remains under debate. Concurrent with these concerns, the clinical application of necroptosis has been cautiously proposed to treat necroptosis-associated diseases, and to overcome resistance to anticancer drugs. Accordingly, the present review will highlight the harnessing of necroptosis for anticancer therapy. To this end, the state-of-the art technique of necroptosis as a cancer therapy will be briefly described, and then its potential for clinical purposes will be delineated. For a further understanding of necroptosis, the present review begins with a basic introduction to necroptosis and its multifaceted physiological consequences.
