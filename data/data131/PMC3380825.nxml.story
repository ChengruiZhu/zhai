, most genetic interactions have been measured under a single phenotype - growth rate in standard laboratory conditions. Recently, genetic interactions have been collected under different phenotypic readouts and experimental conditions. How different are these networks and what can we learn from their differences? We analyzed quantitative genetic interaction networks mapped in yeast under different experimental conditions and phenotypic readouts and found that they provide significant unique information. We next asked if this unique information is complementary. As a measure of complementarity, we asked if combining networks mapped under different experimental conditions could improve gene function prediction. Two genes that genetically interact with a similar set of genes (two genes with similar genetic interaction profiles) are more likely to be in the same pathway or complex and this can be used for gene function prediction. We found that combining multiple genetic interaction profile correlation networks using a simple ‘maximum correlation’ approach improved gene function prediction, demonstrating that the networks provide complementary information. Thus, using diverse phenotypic readouts and experimental conditions will likely increase the amount of information produced by genetic interaction screens.
