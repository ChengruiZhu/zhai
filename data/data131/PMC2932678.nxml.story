In light of the ageing population, the occurrence of bone fractures is expected to rise substantially in the near future. In 5 to 10% of these cases, the healing process does not succeed in repairing the bone, leading to the formation of delayed unions or even non-unions. In this study we used a combination of an animal model mimicking a clinical non-union situation and a mathematical model developed for normal fracture healing to investigate both the causes of non-union formation and potential therapeutic strategies that can be applied to restart the healing process. After showing that the mathematical model is able to simulate key aspects of the non-union formation, we have used it to investigate several treatment strategies. One of these strategies, the treatment of a non-union involving a transplantation of cells from the bone marrow to the fracture site, was also tested in a pilot animal experiment. Both the simulations and the experiments showed the formation of a bony union between the fractured bone ends. In addition, we used the mathematical model to explain some unexpected experimental observations. This study demonstrates the added value of using a combination of mathematical modelling and experimental research as well the potential of using cell transplantation for the treatment of non-unions.
