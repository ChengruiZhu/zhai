Primary poultry meat allergy is mainly seen in adolescents and young adults, though hypersensitivity may have started already at (pre)school age. Egg allergy is usually absent. Typical symptoms of primary poultry meat allergy include OAS (±dyspnea), gastrointestinal complaints, urticaria and angioedema. Severe anaphylaxis with cardiovascular symptoms is rare. Chicken and turkey meat are highly cross-reactive and responsible for most reactions, while duck and goose meat causes milder or no symptoms. Soups, sausages, and ham represent relevant allergen sources, too. Patients with poultry meat allergy unexpectedly often suffer from concomitant allergy to fish and possibly shrimp. Serum specific IgE against fish and shrimp is found in respectively 60 and 40 % of sera, suggestive of cross-reactive allergens in these foods. The allergens thus far recognized in genuine poultry meat are LMW proteins of 5–25 kDa. One of them has been identified as α-parvalbumin cross-reactive with homologous mammal α-parvalbumins but not with fish α-parvalbumins. Recently, myosin light chains, including 23 kDa MLC-1 (Gal d 7) and 15 kDa MLC-3, have been recognized as new major allergens in chicken meat. The high similarity of chicken MLCs with those from various fish species (∼65 %) might explain the clinical association of poultry meat allergy with fish allergy.
