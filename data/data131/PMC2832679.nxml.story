The regulation of gene activity by transcription factors is crucial to the function of all cells. Here, we studied the mechanisms of action of the largest family of gene regulators encoded by the human genome, the so-called KRAB–containing zinc finger proteins (KRAB–ZFPs), which in concert with their universal cofactor KAP1 act as transcriptional repressors. For this, we used two parallel approaches. First, by targeting an ectopic KRAB domain to hundreds of different genes, we found that KRAB/KAP1 can repress promoters located several tens of kilobases from the repressor DNA docking site. We further could show that KRAB induces such long-range effects by mediating the spread of repressive chromatin marks along the body of the gene, resulting in a block of transcriptional initiation at the promoter. In a second set of experiments, we analyzed an endogenous KRAB–ZFP gene cluster, where we could also document KAP1–dependent heterochromatin spreading and transcriptional repression. Together, these results support a model whereby KRAB–ZFPs and KAP1 can mediate long-range transcriptional repression through the spread of silencing chromatin marks. This study thus provides insight into KRAB/KAP1–induced gene regulation at KRAB–ZFP gene clusters, and will further help interpret genome-wide studies of KRAB–ZFPs and KAP1 DNA binding patterns.
