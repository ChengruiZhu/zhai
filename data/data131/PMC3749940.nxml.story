Every heartbeat has an electrical recovery (repolarization) interval that varies in duration from beat to beat. Excessive beat-to-beat variability of repolarization duration has been shown to be a risk marker of potentially fatal heart-rhythm disorders, but the contributing subcellular mechanisms remain incompletely understood. Computational models have greatly enhanced our understanding of several basic electrophysiological mechanisms. We developed a detailed computer model of the ventricular myocyte that can simulate beat-to-beat changes in repolarization duration by taking into account stochastic changes in the opening and closing of individual ion channels responsible for all main ion currents. The model accurately reproduced experimental data from isolated myocytes under both physiological and pathological conditions. Using the model, we identified several mechanisms contributing to repolarization variability, including stochastic gating of ion channels, duration and morphology of the repolarization phase, and intracellular calcium handling, thereby providing insights into its basis as a proarrhythmic marker. Our computer model provides a detailed framework to study the dynamics of cardiac electrophysiology and arrhythmias.
