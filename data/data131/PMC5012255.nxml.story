The coagulation of blood plasma in response to activation with a range of tissue factor (TF) concentrations was studied with a quartz crystal microbalance (QCM), where frequency and half width at half maximum (bandwidth) values measured from the conductance spectrum near resonant frequency were used. Continuous measurement of bandwidth along with the frequency allows for an understanding of the dissipative nature of the forming viscoelastic clot, thus providing information on the complex kinetics of the viscoelastic changes occurring during the clot formation process. Using a mathematical model, these changes in frequency and bandwidth have been used to derive novel QCM parameters of effective elasticity, effective mass density and rigidity factor of the viscoelastic layer. The responses of QCM were compared with those from thromboelastography (TEG) under identical conditions. It was demonstrated that the nature of the clot formed, as determined from the QCM parameters, was highly dependent on the rate of clot formation resulting from the TF concentration used for activation. These parameters could also be related to physical clot characteristics such as fibrin fibre diameter and fibre density, as determined by scanning electron microscopic image analysis. The maximum amplitude (MA) as measured by TEG, which purports to relate to clot strength, was unable to detect these differences.
