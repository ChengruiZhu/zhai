Cases of primary non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma of the prostate are globally rare. The present study reports a case of prostatic diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) with intractable hematuria in a 75-year-old male. The patient presented with difficulties in urination and gross hematuria. A prostate biopsy was performed immediately, followed by conservative treatment for bleeding. A bilateral iliac arteriography and chemoembolization were then performed as emergency procedures under local anesthesia due to significant bleeding and a sharply decreased blood pressure, indicating the failure of the conservative treatment. Consequently, the bleeding was effectively controlled. Pathological examination of the prostate biopsy confirmed the presence of a DLBCL of non-germinal center B-cell origin. Immunohistochemical examination demonstrated cluster of differentiation (CD)20(++), CD3(+), leukocyte common antigen(+++), B-cell lymphoma-2(+) and prostate-specific antigen(−) results. Due to the poor general condition and low hemoglobin levels of the patient, a low-dose Rituximab plus cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine and prednisone (R-CHOP) chemotherapy regimen was administered. Subsequent to three courses of chemotherapy, the patient achieved complete remission. In conclusion, combining R-CHOP and bilateral selective iliac arterial chemoembolization could be a safe and effective way to treat patients with non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma of the prostate and intractable hematuria.
