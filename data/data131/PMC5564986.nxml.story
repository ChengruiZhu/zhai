Retrospective cohort study of 23 skeletally immature patients who underwent ACLR by the same surgical team at a tertiary center during 2011-2013. Athletes had at least two follow-up MRIs, the first MRI 6-12 months after surgery and the second MRI >18 months, were included. Exclusion criteria included those athletes with inMRI follow-up (6) or with a failure of their reconstructions (1). All athletes were treated with an arthroscopic all-inside, all-epiphyseal ACLR, using hamstring autograft, secured with adjustable loop cortical buttons on both tibia and femur. MRI images were analyzed independently and blinded by an orthopaedic surgery fellow and a musculoskeletal radiology fellow. Using a GE Functional Analysis Software, the signal intensity (SI) of the graft was measured in 5 different locations: 1) femoral tunnel, 2) intra-articular proximal turn, 3) midsubstance, 4) intra-articular distal turn, and 5) tibial tunnel. Values were normalized to cortical bone density. The amount of perigraft scarring and synovitis was analyzed. An intraclass correlation coefficient was used to quantify inter-rater reliability, non-parametric Wilcoxon test for perigraft scarring and synovitis, one-way ANOVA to test if significant differences of SI were seen between the different graft locations, and a 2-tailed student t-test for SI changes from 1
