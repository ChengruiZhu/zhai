The prognostic significance of Ki-67 in patients with gastric cancer (GC) remains controversial. The aim of our meta-analysis is to evaluate its association with clinicopathological characteristics and prognostic value in patients with GC. PubMed, EMBASE, and Web of Science were systematically searched up to May 2017. Twenty-two studies including 3,825 patients with GC were analyzed. The meta-analysis indicated that the incidence difference of Ki-67 expression in GC patients was significant when comparing the older group to younger group (odds ratio [OR] =1.44, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.19, 1.75), lymph node positive group to negative group (OR =1.49, 95% CI 1.20, 1.84), the large size tumor group to the small size tumor group (OR =1.27, 95% CI 1.24, 1.68) and the TNM stage III+IV group to TNM stage I+II group (OR =2.28, 95% CI 1.66, 3.12). However, no statistical differences existed in gender. The detection of Ki-67 significantly correlated with the overall survival of patients (hazard ratio =1.51, 95% CI 1.31, 1.72). Our study suggested that Ki-67 overexpression was associated with poor prognosis in GC patients. Ki-67 positive rates may be associated with age, lymph node metastasis, tumor size, and TNM staging system in GC patients.
