In total, 1250 patients with AP (mean age 66.0 ± 10.9 years, 59.6% male, 31.9% previous myocardial infarction) and an indication for ivabradine were included. Sixty-five percent of all patients received BB. Further concomitant standard medication included aspirin (74.2%), statins (69.3%), angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors/angiotensin receptor blockers (84.2%), diuretics (40.0%), long-acting nitrates (15.7%), and calcium antagonists (21.4%). After 4 months of ivabradine treatment (mean daily dose 11.0 ± 2.7 mg), mean HR was reduced from 82.4 ± 11.8 beats per minute (bpm) to 67.1 ± 8.4 bpm. The average number of angina attacks/week decreased from 1.2 ± 1.9 to 0.1 ± 0.6 and the average use of short-acting nitrates/week from 1.5 ± 2.8 units to 0.2 ± 1.0 units. CCS classification of patients improved from 76% classified in CCS grades II or III and 24% in CCS grade I to 66% classified in CCS grade I and only 35% remaining in CCS grades II or III at study end. Response rate to ivabradine (defined as HR <70 bpm or HR reduction ≥10 bpm) reached 87%. HR reduction, symptomatic improvement and response rates were comparable in patients with or without BB. Adverse drug reactions were reported for 2.2% of patients.
