 NABSA-ELISA system was 1 CFU and the RNA in non-target bacteria or fungus was not amplified. The performance of this NASBA-ELISA compared to RT-PCR and galactomannan (GM) was evaluated by testing blood samples from 86 patients at high risk for IA. The sensitivity of NASBA-ELISA, RT-PCR and GM-ELISA was 80.56 % (95 % CI 63.98–91.81), 72.22 % (95 % CI 54.81–85.80), 58.33 % (95 % CI 40.76–74.49), respectively, and the specificity was 80.00 % (95 % CI 66.28–89.97), 84.00 % (95 % CI 70.89–92.83), 82.00 % (95 % CI 68.56–91.42). The efficiency of the three methods in various combinations was also evaluated. Combination of NASBA-ELISA and GM-ELISA testing achieved perfect specificity (100 %; 95 % CI 92.89–100) and perfect positive predictive value (100 %; 95 % CI 83.16–100). The best sensitivity (97.22 %; 95 % CI 85.47–99.93) and the highest Youden index (0.652) were obtained by testing with both NASBA and RT-PCR in parallel. In conclusion, the NASBA-ELISA assay consists of an alternative process for large-scale samples detection with semi-quantitative results and provides good clinical performance without resorting to expensive equipment. This assay makes it possible for the NASBA based RNA diagnosis to become a routine work in laboratories in less developed countries with fewer resources.
