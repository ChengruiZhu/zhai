Our 3-D model for a junctional complex (JC) in the erythrocyte membrane skeleton proposed that the helical actin protofilament functions as a mechanical axis for three pairs of αβ spectrin (Sp), and each pair wraps around the protofilament in a back-to-back fashion. The distal end of each Sp is further associated with the lipid bilayer by a suspension complex (SC). Here, we detail how splitting and rejoining of αβ Sp around a protofilament may form a loop that sustains and equilibrates tension. Sequential association of β and α Sp solves the challenge of constructing multiple loops along the protofilament, and topological connection facilitates their re-association. The wrap-around model minimizes the strain of the actin binding site on β Sp due to tension, redirection, or sliding of intertwined Sp. Pairing Sp balances the opposing forces and provides a mechanism for elastic recovery. The wrap-around junction thus provides mechanical advantages over a point-attachment junction in maintaining the integrity and functionality of the network. Severing α or β Sp may convert a wrapping-around junction to a point-attachment junction. In that case, a “bow up” motion of JC during deformation may disturb or flip the overlaid lipid bilayer, and mark stressed erythrocytes for phagocytosis.
