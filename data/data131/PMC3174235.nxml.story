Amyloid is a protein fold that is normally associated with pathology, such as neurodegeneration in Alzheimer, Parkinson, and Creutzfeldtâ€“Jakob diseases. The amyloid fold has also been exploited by nature for functional purposes; for example, proteolytic fragments of the pigment cell-specific integral membrane protein, PMEL, form amyloid fibrils upon which melanin pigments polymerize within subcellular organelles called melanosomes. Whereas animal models that entirely lack PMEL expression have modest pigment loss, chickens or horses with small in-frame mutations that alter a non-amyloidogenic region of PMEL have severe pigment loss that is thought to be associated with pigment cell death. We show here that these mutations alter the capacity of this region to self-associate, likely changing the conformation of full-length PMEL oligomers. While these changes do not affect the intrinsic ability of PMEL to form amyloid fibrils, they alter either the fibrils themselves or the kinetics of fibril formation such that they form more compact structures and inhibit melanin formation when expressed in melanocytes in culture. Based on our results, we speculate that minor alterations in pre-amyloid assembly of an amyloidogenic protein influences entry into either a benign or a pathogenic amyloid pathway.
