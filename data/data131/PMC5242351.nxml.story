(OME) of leaves on alterations induced in a model of type 2 diabetic rats. Adult male Wistar rats were fed high fat diet for 3 weeks and injected a single dose of streptozotocin (35 mg/kg) intraperitoneally to induce type 2 diabetic rats. Diabetic rats were given aqueous extract of OME in a dose of 20 mg/kg orally for 3 weeks. Changes in lipid profiles, glucose, insulin, expression of some genes related to glucose metabolism and histopathological changes in liver and kidney were examined. Administration of OME improved and normalized dyslipidemia recorded in type 2 diabetic rats together with reduction in glucose and insulin levels. OME induced up-regulation in gene expression of glucose [adiponectin and glucose transporter-2 (GLUT-2)] and lipid metabolism [lipoprotein lipase (LPL)]. Moreover, OME normalized histopathological changes occurred in liver and kidney of diabetic rats. OME decreased lipids accumulation in liver and kidney and increased regeneration of hepatic parenchyma and restored normal renal architecture with disappearance of fat droplets. In conclusion, OME improved dyslipidemia associated with type 2 diabetes through regulation of genes related to glucose and lipid metabolism.
