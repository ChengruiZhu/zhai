To explore the role of calcium in mediating the action of carbachol in chloride-secreting epithelia, we simultaneously measured intracellular free [Ca] ([Ca]i) and the potassium conductance (gK) of the basolateral membrane in T84 cells grown on collagen-coated filters. [Ca]i was measured with fura-2 and fluorescence microscopy and expressed as a relative value ([Ca]'i) normalized to control. To assess changes in basolateral gK, we measured the short circuit current (Isc) in the presence of luminal amphotericin and a transepithelial mucosa-to-serosa K+ gradient (Germann, W. J., M. E. Lowy, S. A. Ernst, and D. C. Dawson. 1986. J. Gen. Physiol. 88:237-251). Treatment of the monolayers with carbachol resulted in a parallel increase and then decrease in [Ca]'i and gK. The carbachol-induced changes in gK appeared to be dependent on the increase in [Ca]i because stimulation of gK was significantly diminished when the hormone-induced increase in [Ca]'i was blunted, either by loading the cells with BAPTA or by reducing the extracellular [Ca]. The carbachol-stimulated increase in gK appeared to be the direct result of the increase in steady-state [Ca]'i. The changes in gK and [Ca]'i after stimulation with carbachol were correlated and ionomycin also increased gK and [Ca]'i in a parallel manner. The carbachol- induced delta gK per delta[Ca]'i, however, was greater than that after ionomycin. Because ionomycin and carbachol appear to open the same channel, a conclusion based on inhibitor and selectivity experiments, carbachol may have a second action that amplifies the effect of calcium on gK.
