Although the association between episodic migraine and psychiatric comorbidities is well documented, few studies have focused on the comorbidity with chronic migraine (CM) and discrepancies exist between population-based and clinic-based data. The objective of this study is to compare demographic and psychiatric comorbidity correlates between CM samples drawn from the community and tertiary care. All inhabitants from a city borough were interviewed for the presence of headaches occurring 15 or more days per month. CM was diagnosed after subjects had been interviewed and examined by a headache doctor. Participants were also assessed with a structured interview by a psychiatrist, who assigned diagnoses based on the DSM-IV. The same investigators assessed all patients consecutively seen in a university-based outpatient headache center over a 4-month period. The samples consist of 41 individuals from the community and 43 from the headache center. Sociodemographic profiles were similar between groups with the exception of the mean number of years of formal education.
