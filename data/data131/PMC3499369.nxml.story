Neurons of the statoacoustic ganglion (SAG), which innervate the inner ear, are derived from neuroblasts originating from the floor of the otic vesicle. Neuroblasts quickly delaminate from the otic vesicle to form dividing progenitors, which eventually differentiate into mature neurons of the SAG. Fgf has been implicated in initial neuroblast specification in multiple vertebrate species. However, the role of Fgf at later stages remains uncertain, because previous studies have not been able to evaluate the effects of changing levels of Fgf, nor have they been able to clearly distinguish the effects of Fgf at different stages of SAG development. We have combined conditional loss of function, misexpression, and laser-ablation studies in zebrafish to elucidate how graded Fgf coordinates distinct steps in SAG development. Initially moderate Fgf in a spatial gradient specifies neuroblasts within the otic vesicle. Later, mature SAG neurons express Fgf5 and, as additional neurons accumulate outside the otic vesicle, rising levels of Fgf terminate further specification. Elevated Fgf also slows maturation of progenitors, maintaining a stable progenitor pool in which growth and differentiation are evenly balanced. This feedback facilitates steady production of new neurons as the animal grows through larval and adults stages.
