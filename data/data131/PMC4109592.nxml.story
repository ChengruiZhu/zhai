Lymphomas with overlapping histological features of two distinct entities cause difficulty in classification. Their classification is of particular significance when the two alternatives require different treatment modalities. We present a diagnostically challenging case of a nodular lymphocyte predominant Hodgkin lymphoma (NLPHL) with features of T-cell/histiocyte-rich large B-cell lymphoma (THRLBCL). Our patient is a 39-year-old woman who presented with painless subclavicular and axillary lymphadenopathy. The biopsied lymph node showed diffuse architectural effacement and scattered large neoplastic cells with large irregular nuclei and prominent nucleoli. These cells were positive for CD20 and Bcl-6 and negative for CD15, CD30, IgD, and Bcl-2. The background cells were predominantly T lymphocytes, whereas B cells were markedly depleted. The lymph node was interpreted as NLPHL, consistent with THRLBCL-like variant. NLPHL, especially THRLBC-like variant, and de novo THRLBCL are characterized by significant morphologic and immunophenotypic overlap. Our case demonstrates a rare predominance of background T-cells in NLPHL and emphasizes the importance of thorough evaluation of multiple morphologic and immunophenotypic features as an essential approach for arriving at the correct diagnosis.
