 simulated ischemia-reperfusion (I-R) setting. Ischemic conditions were simulated by oxygen and glucose deprivation for 160 min using H9c2 rat cardiomyoblast cells. After 30 min of reperfusion, these cells received 4 types of treatments: no added cells (I-R model), fluorescently labeled (Vybrant DiD) therapeutic H9c2 cells with vehicle (H9c2) or PARP inhibitor (10 μM or 100 μM PJ34) pretreatment. We assessed viability (live, apoptotic and necrotic) of both ‘postischemic’ and therapeutic cells with flow cytometric analysis using calcein-AM/ethidium homodimer-2 fluorescent staining after 24 h of co-culture. Further measurements on necrosis and metabolic activity were performed using lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) release and resazurin based assays. The percentage of surviving therapeutic cells increased significantly with PARP inhibition (untreated, 52.02±5.01%; 10 μM PJ34, 63.38±4.50%; 100 μM PJ34, 64.99±3.47%). The percentage of necrotic cells decreased in a similar manner (untreated, 37.23±4.40%; 10 μM PJ34, 26.83±3.49%; 100 μM PJ34, 24.96±2.43%). Notably, the survival of the cells that suffered I-R injury was also significantly higher when treated with PARP-inhibited therapeutic cells (I-R model, 36.44±5.05%; H9c2, 42.81±5.11%; 10 μM PJ34, 52.07±5.80%; 100 μM PJ34, 54.95±5.55%), while necrosis was inhibited (I-R model, 43.64±4.00%; H9c2, 37.29±4.55%; 10 μM PJ34, 30.18±4.60%; 100 μM PJ34, 25.52±3.47%). In subsequent experiments, PARP inhibition decreased LDH-release of the observed combined cell population and enhanced the metabolic activity. Thus, our results suggest that pretreating the therapeutically added cells with a PARP inhibitor could be beneficial in the setting of cell-based therapies.
