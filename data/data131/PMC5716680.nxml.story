Differentiating demyelinating conditions from neoplastic conditions can pose a significant challenge. There are a number of reports in the literature of large ring-enhancing, space-occupying lesions that were initially considered neoplastic or infectious but, on further review, were deemed demyelinating. Creutzfeldt-Peters cells (CPC) are reactive astrocytes with fragmented nuclear inclusions that are routinely seen in multiple sclerosis (MS) and generally exclude the diagnosis of glioblastoma (GB). The patient is a 78-year-old man with a history of prostate cancer, which was treated with radiation therapy, who presented with altered mental status. A magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan of the brain revealed a 4.6 x 3.1 cm mass lesion in the right posterior temporal lobe with minimal mass effect and heterogeneous contrast enhancement. The patient underwent an open biopsy of the mass, which on histology was rich with Creutzfeldt-Peters cells. Frozen histology was unclear and full resection of the mass was delayed. AÂ molecular and immunohistochemical analysis confirmed glioblastoma. The patient returned four weeks later for a subtotal resection of the tumor. The case presented demonstrates an example of a challenging diagnosis. Differentiating between demyelinating and neoplastic conditions is critical since the management and prognosis differ greatly. More importantly, we present a case of glioblastoma rich with Creutzfeldt-Peters cells, which has previously not been reported in the literature.
