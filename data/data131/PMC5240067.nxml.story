Diabetes prevalence shows a continuous increasing trend in South Asia. Although well-established treatment modalities exist for type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) management, they are limited by their side effect profile. Sodium–glucose co-transporter 2 inhibitors (SGLT2i) with their novel insulin-independent renal action provide improved glycemic control, supplemented by reduction in weight and blood pressure, and cardiovascular safety. Based on the clinical outcomes with SGLT2i in patients with T2DM, treatment strategies that make a “good clinical sense” are desirable. Considering the peculiar lifestyle, body types, dietary patterns (long duration religious fasts), and the hot climate of the South Asian population, a unanimous decision was taken to design specific, customized guidelines for T2DM treatment strategies in these regions. The panel met for a discussion three times so as to get a consensus for the guidelines, and only unanimous consensus was included. After careful consideration of the quality and strength of the available evidence, the executive summary of this consensus statement was developed based on the American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists/American College of Endocrinology protocol.
