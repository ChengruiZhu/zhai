Aberrant expression of microRNAs (miRNAs) are believed to play a central role in the initiation and development of cancer. The aim of our study was to determine the clinical significance of serum miR-10b in melanoma. A total of 85 and 30 serum samples were obtained from patients with melanoma and healthy volunteers respectively. qRT-PCR was performed to evaluate the expression level of miR-10b in the melanoma cell lines and the serum samples from the participants. Then the clinical significance of serum miR-10b was further determined. Our results showed that the expression level of miR-10b was significantly increased in metastasis melanoma cells and melanoma patients compared to their respective controls. In addition, serum miR-10b expression level was able to discriminate melanoma patients from healthy volunteers as well differentiate melanoma patients at different clinical stage with high accuracy. Moreover, upregulation of serum miR-10b was positively associated with enhanced lymph node metastasis, advanced clinical stage and a shortened survival rate. Finally serum miR-10b was an independent prognostic factor for melanoma. Collectively, our study suggests that serum miR-10b level is upregulated in melanoma and associated with poor prognosis. It may be used as a potential prognostic biomarker for melanoma.
