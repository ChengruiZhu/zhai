Using K+-selective microelectrodes, [K+]o was measured in the subretinal space of the isolated retina of the toad, Bufo marinus. During maintained illumination, [K+]o fell to a minimum and then recovered to a steady level that was approximately 0.1 mM below its dark level. Spatial buffering of [K+]o by Muller (glial) cells could contribute to this reaccumulation of K+. However, superfusion with substances that might be expected to block glial transport of K+ had no significant effect upon the reaccumulation of K+. These substances included blockers of gK (TEA+, Cs+, Rb+, 4-AP) and a gliotoxin (alpha AAA). Progressive slowing of the rods' Na+/K+ pump (perhaps caused by a light-evoked decrease in [Na+]i) also could contribute to this reaccumulation of K+ by reducing the uptake of K+ from the subretinal space. As evidence for a major contribution by this mechanism, treatments designed to prevent such slowing of the pump reversibly blocked reaccumulation. These treatments included superfusion with 2 microM ouabain, or lowering [K+]o, PO2, or temperature. It is likely that such treatments inhibit the pump, increase [Na+]i, and attenuate any light-evoked decrease in [Na+]i. The results are consistent with the following hypothesis. At light onset, the decrease in rod gNa will reduce the Na+ influx and the resulting rod hyperpolarization will reduce the K+ efflux. In combination with these reduced passive fluxes, the continuing active fluxes will lower both [K+]o and [Na+]i, which in turn will inhibit the pump. In support of this hypothesis, the solutions to a pair of coupled differential equations that model changes in both [K+]o and [Na+]i match quantitatively the time course of the observed changes in [K+]o during and after maintained illumination for all stimuli examined.
