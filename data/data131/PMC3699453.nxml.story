The outcome of sepsis is affected by many factors, but fast, accurate identification of the bacterial infection and determination of its antibiotic susceptibility is essential to ensure that patients receive appropriate antibiotics. Laboratory diagnosis of bloodstream infections currently requires incubation of blood samples in a liquid medium (broth) followed by growth on solid media to identify the bacteria and to test for antibiotic sensitivity. It takes about 3 days after a positive broth culture is obtained to complete this process during which time patients are treated with broad spectrum antimicrobials, which may be ineffective. In this study, the researchers evaluate the sensitivity (a test's ability to identify patients who are positive for a specific condition) and specificity (a test's ability to identify patients who do not have a specific condition) of the Verigene BC-GP test. This multiplex, automated microarray-based nucleic acid test has been developed to directly and simultaneously identify 12 species of Gram-positive bacteria (the commonest cause of bacterial bloodstream infections) and three antibiotic resistance determinants in blood culture broths that contain Gram-positive bacteria.
