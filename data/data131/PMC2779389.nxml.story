The ectopic distribution of synaptic ribbons in dendrites of mouse retinal bipolar cells was examined by using genetic ablation of metabotropic glutamate receptor subtype 6 (mGluR6), electron microscopy, and immunocytochemistry. Ectopic ribbons were observed in dendrites of rod and ON-cone bipolar cells in the mGluR6-deficient mouse but not in those of wild-type mice. The number of rod spherules facing the ectopic ribbons in mGluR6-deficient rod bipolar dendrites increased gradually during early growth and reached a plateau level of about 20% at 12 weeks. These ectopic ribbons were immunopositive for RIBEYE, a ribbon-specific protein, but the associated vesicles were immunonegative for synaptophysin, a synaptic-vesicle-specific protein. The presence of ectopic ribbons was correlated with an increase in the roundness of the invaginating dendrites of the rod bipolar cells. We further confirmed ectopic ribbons in dendrites of OFF-cone bipolar cells in wild-type retinas. Of the four types of OFF-cone bipolar cells (T1–T4), only the T2-type, which had a greater number of synaptic ribbons at the axon terminal and a thicker axon cylinder than the other types, had ectopic ribbons. Light-adapted experiments revealed that, in wild-type mice under enhanced-light adaptation (considered similar to the mGluR6-deficient state), the roundness in the invaginating dendrites and axon terminals of rod bipolar cells increased, but no ectopic ribbons were detected. Based on these findings and known mechanisms for neurotransmitter release and protein trafficking, the possible mechanisms underlying the ectopic ribbons are discussed on the basis of intracellular transport for the replenishment of synaptic proteins.
