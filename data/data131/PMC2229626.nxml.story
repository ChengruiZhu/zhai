Retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) cells mediate the recognition and clearance of effete photoreceptor outer segments (POS), a process central to the maintenance of normal vision. Given the emerging importance of Toll-like receptors (TLRs) in transmembrane signaling in response to invading pathogens as well as endogenous substances, we hypothesized that TLRs are associated with RPE cell management of POS. TLR4 clusters on human RPE cells in response to human, but not bovine, POS. However, TLR4 clustering could be inhibited by saturating concentrations of an inhibitory anti-TLR4 mAb. Furthermore, human POS binding to human RPE cells elicited transmembrane metabolic and calcium signals within RPE cells, which could be blocked by saturating doses of an inhibitory anti-TLR4 mAb. However, the heterologous combination of bovine POS and human RPE did not trigger these signals. The pattern recognition receptor CD36 collected at the POS–RPE cell interface for both homologous and heterologous samples, but human TLR4 only collected at the human POS–human RPE cell interface. Kinetic experiments of human POS binding to human RPE cells revealed that CD36 arrives at the POS–RPE interface followed by TLR4 accumulation within 2 min. Metabolic and calcium signals immediately follow. Similarly, the production of reactive oxygen metabolites (ROMs) was observed for the homologous human system, but not the heterologous bovine POS–human RPE cell system. As (a) the bovine POS/human RPE combination did not elicit TLR4 accumulation, RPE signaling, or ROM release, (b) TLR4 arrives at the POS–RPE cell interface just before signaling, (c) TLR4 blockade with an inhibitory anti-TLR4 mAb inhibited TLR4 clustering, signaling, and ROM release in the human POS–human RPE system, and (d) TLR4 demonstrates similar clustering and signaling responses to POS in confluent RPE monolayers, we suggest that TLR4 of RPE cells participates in transmembrane signaling events that contribute to the management of human POS.
