Although important strides have been made in targeted therapy for certain leukemias and subtypes of breast cancer, the standard of care for most carcinomas still involves chemotherapy, radiotherapy, surgery, or a combination of these. Two processes serve as obstacles to the successful treatment of carcinomas. First, a majority of deaths from these types of cancers occurs as a result of distant metastases and not the primary tumors themselves. Second, subsets of cells that are able to survive conventional therapy drive the aggressive relapse of the tumors, often in forms that are resistant to treatment. A frequently observed feature of malignant carcinomas is the loss of epithelial traits and the gain of certain mesenchymal ones that are programmed by the cell-biological program termed the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT). The EMT program can confer (i) an ability to disseminate, (ii) an ability to become stem-like tumor-initiating cells, (iii) an ability to found new tumor colonies at distant anatomical sites, and (iv) an elevated resistance to therapy. These multiple powers of the EMT program explain why it has become an attractive target for therapeutic intervention. Recent work has revealed the variable nature of the EMT, with multiple versions of the program being observed depending on the tissue context and the stage of tumor progression. In this review, we attempt to crystallize emerging concepts in the research on EMT and stemness and discuss the benefits of using a differentiation-based therapeutic strategy for the eradication of stem-like populations that have adopted various versions of the EMT program.
