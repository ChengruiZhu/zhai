The control of upright stance is a challenging task since the objective is to maintain the equilibrium of an intrinsically unstable biomechanical system. Somatosensory information is used by the central nervous system to modulate muscle contraction, which prevents the body from falling. While the visual and vestibular systems also provide important additional sensory information, a human being with only somatosensory inputs is able to maintain an upright stance. In this study, we used a biologically-based large-scale neuromusculoskeletal model driven only by somatosensory feedback to investigate human postural control from a neurophysiological point of view. No neural structures above the spinal cord were included in the model. The results showed that the model based on a spinal control of posture can reproduce several neuromechanical outcomes previously reported in the literature, including an intermittent muscle activation. Since this intermittent muscular recruitment is an emergent property of this spinal-like controller, we argue that the so-called intermittent control of upright stance might be produced by an interplay between spinal cord properties and modulated sensory inflow.
