We have previously shown that the obligate intracellular pathogen chlamydia can suppress interferon (IFN)-γ–inducible major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II expression in infected cells by degrading upstream stimulation factor (USF)-1. We now report that chlamydia can also inhibit both constitutive and IFN-γ–inducible MHC class I expression in the infected cells. The inhibition of MHC class I molecule expression correlates well with degradation of RFX5, an essential downstream transcription factor required for both the constitutive and IFN-γ–inducible MHC class I expression. We further demonstrate that a lactacystin-sensitive proteasome-like activity identified in chlamydia-infected cell cytosolic fraction can degrade both USF-1 and RFX5. This proteasome-like activity is dependent on chlamydial but not host protein synthesis. Host preexisting proteasomes may not be required for the unique proteasome-like activity. These observations suggest that chlamydia-secreted factors may directly participate in the proteasome-like activity. Efforts to identify the chlamydial factors are underway. These findings provide novel information on the molecular mechanisms of chlamydial evasion of host immune recognition.
