Living things work by the actions of proteins and other molecules that are encoded in their genomes. Genome projects aim to construct a “parts list” of life by cataloguing all of these molecules. However, some molecules are harder to identify than others. One difficult category is short proteins. This is because protein-coding nucleotide sequences have statistical features that, for large proteins, are very pronounced and readily distinguishable from non-coding sequence, but for small proteins are not. Thus, to avoid erroneous predictions, many genome projects have employed an artificial length threshold of 100 amino acids. Hence, short proteins are underrepresented in protein catalogues, although they are known to play important roles in immunity, cell signalling, and metabolism. This study clarifies the abundance of short proteins by exploiting two advantageous resources. The first is the large FANTOM collection of mouse transcript sequences: it is much easier to identify proteins in mature transcripts than in raw genome sequence. The second is a method to identify protein-coding sequences by examining how they differ between organisms. The redundancy of the genetic code implies that these differences will follow distinctive patterns, and this approach has the statistical power to break the 100-amino-acid barrier and reliably identify short proteins.
