Coronary calcification is a risk factor for ischemic heart disease. Hydroxyapatite that is formed by polymerization from calcium phosphate tribasic (CPT) is the major constituent of coronary calcium deposits. If CPT could be visualized, coronary calcification could be predicted and prevented. We discovered that when CPT and collagen I, the main constituent of collagen fibers, are mixed with lac dye (LD) and then exposed to fluorescent light excited at 345 ± 15 nm and emitted at 420 nm, a purple fluorescence that is characteristic of CPT only is elicited. So, we examined localization of CPT and its relation to plaque morphology by color fluorescent angioscopy (CFA) or microscopy (CFM) in 24 coronary arteries obtained from 12 autopsy subjects. By CFA, the incidence (%) of CPT as confirmed by purple fluorescence in 15 normal segments, 25 white plaques, 14 yellow plaques without necrotic core (NC) and 8 yellow plaques with NC was 20, 36, 64 and 100 (p < 0.05 vs. normal segments), respectively. By CFM, the CPT was either deposited alone amorphously or surrounded hydroxyapatite that was identified by Oil Red O, methylene blue and von Kossa’s stain. The results suggested that CFA using LD is feasible for imaging CPT, that is a precursor of hydroxyapatite, in human coronary plaques, and this technique would help prediction and discovery of a preventive method of coronary calcification.
