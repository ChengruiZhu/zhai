Despite intense research, the genetic risk factors for essential hypertension and blood pressure (BP) regulation have not been identified with consistency. We conducted a genome wide association scan using over 800,000 genetic markers in an African American sample of 1,017 adults in the Washington, D.C., area of the United States. We found evidence to suggest that genetic variants in several genes, including PMS1, SLC24A4, YWHA7, IPO7, and CACANA1H, are significantly associated with systolic BP levels. From our previous knowledge of human physiology, two of these genes have potential roles to play in BP regulation. The evidence for genetic variants influencing diastolic BP levels and hypertension status was weaker and inconclusive. To our knowledge, this is the first study that has used a genome-wide association approach to study hypertension and BP in an African American population, a minority group that experiences hypertension more frequently and more severely than other population groups in the United States. The findings will be useful to other researchers seeking to advance our understanding of the genetic factors that influence BP with the hope that these insights will eventually translate to new and better treatment options for hypertension in African Americans and other global populations.
