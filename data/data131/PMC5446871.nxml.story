The positioning of the patient on the fracture table is critical for the successful reduction and operative fixation of intertrochanteric hip fractures. However, this manipulation is challenging with patients who have undergone amputations of their legs. A 97-year-old man presented to the emergency department with symptom of right hip pain following a mechanical fall. He had a below-knee amputation on his right leg following a traffic accident as a 19-year-old and had a below-knee patellar tendon bearing prosthesis fitted to his lower limb for mobility. Radiographs of his pelvis revealed a displaced intertrochanteric fracture of the right side femur. The patient was positioned on a fracture table, as in the standard procedure. The method of inverting the traction boot to accommodate the flexed knee and stump described by Al-Harthy could be used to provide traction and rotational control. Internal fixation was performed using a short femoral nail. Postoperatively, the patient could walk with full weight bearing using a prosthesis on his affected limb. The method of inverting the traction boot to accommodate the flexed knee and stump can be used safely and effectively to achieve and maintain fracture reduction during fixation of intertrochanteric fractures for patients with a below-knee amputated limb.
