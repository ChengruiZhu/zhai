Cultured rat ovarian granulosa cells undergo a dramatic morphological change when exposed to follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH). Exposure to FSH causes the flattened epithelioid granulosa cells to assume a nearly spherical shape while retaining cytoplasmic processes which contact the substrate as well as adjacent cells. This effect of FSH is preceded by a dose-dependent increase in intracellular cAMP, is potentiated by cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterase inhibitors, and is mimicked by dibutyryl cAMP. Prostaglandins E1 or E2 and cholera enterotoxin also cause the cells to change shape. A subpopulation of the cells responds to luteinizing hormone. These morphological changes, which are blocked by 2,4-dinitrophenol, resemble those produced by treating cultures with cytochalasin B. Electron microscopy shows that the unstimulated, flattened cells contain bundles of microfilaments particularly in the cortical and basal regions. After FSH stimulation, microfilament bundles are not found in the rounded granulosa cell bodies but they are present in the thin cytoplasmic processes. These data suggest that the morphological change results from a cAMP-mediated, energy-dependent mechanism that may involve the alteration of microfilaments in these cells.
