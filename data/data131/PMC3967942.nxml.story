What are the commonalities and differences of human brains when compared to the brains of other primates? The brain can be conceived as a complex network. Its topological properties constrain its function. Ethical and technical reasons necessitate the use of animal brains, like the macaque monkey, as models for the human brain. However, evolutionary changes, including “brain rewiring”, might result in unique human features. Hence, a detailed and quantitative comparative analysis of the connectivity of the brains of the two species is needed. Here, we undertake this task by adopting techniques analogous to those used in comparative studies in other scientific fields. Our approach reveals converging but also diverging wiring patterns. The brain of the two species as a whole is similarly wired. The majority of the brain regions appear to have evolutionary conserved connectivity patterns while for certain regions this appears not to be the case. We also uncover an evolutionary conserved “structural backbone” in the brain of the two species. Our findings highlight common and unique “wiring properties” of the brains of these two primate species and offer a quantitative basis for translating findings from macaque research to human research.
