A total of 1286 (73.5% female) patients were switched to LPV/r 991 (77%) and ATV/r 295 (23%) (p<0.001). NRTI backbones were 760 on TDF/3TC (66.8% LPV/r vs 33.2% on ATV/r), 504 on AZT/3TC (93.3% vs 6.7%), and 22 on ABC/3TC (59% vs 41%). Median (IQR) time on first line for LPV/r was 21 (1–44) months and for ATV/r was 41 months (22–68). Median CD4 (IQR) at switch to LPV/r was 181 cells/uL (66–424) and to ATV/r was 122 (57–238) (p≤0.001). A total of 366 patients had CD4 done at six months after switch and the mean (IQR) CD4 increase was 153 (54–241) for LPV/r versus 116 (52–171) for ATV/r (p=0.232). Additionally, 304 had a CD4 at 12 months and the means were 172 (45–272) for LPV/r vs 179 (60–271) for ATV/r (p=0.426). There was no significant difference in the mean increment by NRTI backbone or by stratifying to viral load (VL) at time of switch to VL <100,000 and ≥100,000. Median (IQR) VL at switch was 61,000 (13,000–2,030,000) LPV/r and 51,000 (14,000_151,000) ATV/r. 269 had a VL done in the first 12 months and 178/250 (71.2%) on LPV/r versus 16/19 (84.2%) on ATV/r were undetectable (p=0.228). 259 (26%) LPV/r versus 33(11%) ATV/r had ≥1 opportunistic infections on second line (p<0.001).
