Two of the major rat mast cell proteases, rat mast cell protease 1 (RMCP-1) and RMCP-2, have for many years served as important phenotypic markers for studies of various aspects of mast cell (MC) biology. However, except for these proteases only fragmentary information has been available on the structure and complexity of proteases expressed by different subpopulations of rat MCs. To address these questions, cDNA libraries were constructed from freshly isolated rat peritoneal MCs and from the rat mucosal MC line RBL-1. cDNA clones for 10 different serine proteases (RMCP-1-10), and the MC carboxypeptidase A were isolated and characterized. Six of these proteases have not been isolated previously. Based on their protease content, three separate subpopulations of MCs were identified. Connective tissue MCs (CTMCs) from the ear and peritoneum express the chymases RMCP-1 and -5, the tryptases RMCP-6, and -7 and the carboxypeptidase A. However, based on a large difference in the level of expression of RMCP-7, CTMCs of these two organs may be regarded as two separate subpopulations. RMCP-2 and the three closely related proteases of the RMCP-8 subfamily were identified as the major mucosal MC proteases in rat. In contrast to what has been reported for human MCs, no expression of cathepsin G or cathepsin Gâ€“like proteases was detected in any of the rat MC populations. To determine mRNA frequencies for the various proteases expressed by normal tissue MCs, an unamplified peritoneal MC cDNA library was screened with a panel of monospecific cDNA probes. These results showed that peritoneal MCs are highly specialized effector cells with mRNA frequencies for the major proteases in the range of several percent of the total mRNA pool.
