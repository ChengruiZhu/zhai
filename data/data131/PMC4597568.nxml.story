Testing was performed on 14 matched glenoid pairs with simulated bony Bankart fractures; the defect width was 25% of the glenoid diameter and the fracture was perpendicular to the 3 o’clock position. Additionally, a labral avulsion was created and extended from the 6 to the 12 o’clock position. All labral avulsions were then repaired above and below the bony Bankart with suture anchors. Half of the bony Bankart fractures were repaired with a double-point technique, while the contralateral glenoid was repaired with a single-point technique (Fig 1). Following the repairs, distance between the intra-articular surfaces of the fragment and glenoid were measured for an unloaded condition and with 10 N of tension applied to the fragment, to quantify fracture displacement. To determine the biomechanical stability of the repairs, specimens were secured in a tensile testing machine and aligned so that the load vector was 30° medial to the superior-inferior plane. The repair constructs were preconditioned with sinusoidal cyclic loading between 5 N to 25 N for 10 cycles and then pulled to failure at a rate of 5 mm/min. Load (N) at 1 mm and 2 mm of fracture displacement were determined. Non-parametric statistics were used (MWU).
