Regeneration of pulp-dentin complex in an infected necrotic tooth with an open apex is possible if the canal is effectively disinfected. The purpose of this case report is to add a regenerative endodontic case to the existing literature about using Platelet Rich Fibrin (PRF). A nine year old boy who accidently broke his immature maxillary central incisor tooth, developed pulpal necrosis with apical periodontitis. After the access cavity preparation, the canal was effectively irrigated with 20 ml of 5.25% sodium hypochlorite solution and 10ml of 0.2% chlorhexidine solution and dried with paper points. Triple antibiotic paste was placed inside the canal and left for 21 days. 12 ml of whole blood was drawn from the patient's right antecubital vein and centrifuged for 10 minutes to obtain the Choukroun's PRF. After the removal of the triple antibiotic paste, the PRF was placed into the canal till the level of cementoenamel junction and 3mm of grey MTA was placed directly over the PRF clot. The setting of MTA was confirmed 3 days later and the tooth was double sealed with GIC and Composite restoration. After 1 year the clinical examination revealed negative responses to percussion and palpation tests. The tooth responded positively to cold and electric pulp tests. Radiographic examination revealed continued thickening of the dentinal walls, root lengthening, regression of the periapical lesion and apical closure. On the basis of the results obtained in our case report we conclude that revitalization of necrotic infected immature tooth is possible under conditions of total canal disinfection and PRF is an ideal biomaterial for pulp-dentin complex regeneration.
