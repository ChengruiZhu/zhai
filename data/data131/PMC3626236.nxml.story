This study examines the dynamic co-localization of lipid-anchored
fluorescent proteins in living cells using pulsed-interleaved excitation
fluorescence cross-correlation spectroscopy (PIE-FCCS) and fluorescence
lifetime analysis. Specifically, we look at the pairwise co-localization
of anchors from lymphocyte cell kinase (LCK: myristoyl, palmitoyl,
palmitoyl), RhoA (geranylgeranyl), and K-Ras (farnesyl) proteins in
different cell types. In Jurkat cells, a density-dependent increase
in cross-correlation among RhoA anchors is observed, while LCK anchors
exhibit a more moderate increase and broader distribution. No correlation
was detected among K-Ras anchors or between any of the different anchor
types studied. Fluorescence lifetime data reveal no significant FÃ¶rster
resonance energy transfer in any of the data. In COS 7 cells, minimal
correlation was detected among LCK or RhoA anchors. Taken together,
these observations suggest that some lipid anchors take part in anchor-specific
co-clustering with other existing clusters of native proteins and
lipids in the membrane. Importantly, these observations do not support
a simple interpretation of lipid anchor-mediated organization driven
by partitioning based on binary lipid phase separation.
