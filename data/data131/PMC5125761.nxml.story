The aim of the present study was to investigate the inhibitory effects of celastrol-loaded nanomicelles (CNMs) on activated macrophage-induced corneal neovascularization (CNV) in rats and cytokine secretion in macrophages. Using an angiogenesis assay in vitro, we detected the effects of CNMs on human umbilical vein endothelial cell (HUVEC) migration and invasion. In addition, the expression levels of cytokines secreted from hypoxia-induced macrophages were assessed through cytokine array analysis. The expression of hypoxia-inducible factors-1α (HIF-1α), nuclear factor-kappa B p65 (NF-κB p65), phospho-nuclear factor-kappa B p65 (phospho-NF-κB p65), p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (p38 MAPK), phospho-p38 MAPK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2), and phospho-ERK1/2 was analyzed by western blotting. Activated macrophages were elicited through mineral oil lumbar injection, labeled with 1,19-dioctadecyl-3-3-39,39-tetramethylindocarbocyanine (DiI) and implanted into the corneal micro-pocket to induce CNV and to assess the antiangiogenic effect in rats. CNV was morphometrically analyzed using ImageJ software. Histopathological features were evaluated by immunofluorescence immunostaining for vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) on day 2 after surgery. In the present study, the results indicated that CNMs significantly inhibited the migration and invasion of HUVECs; remarkably attenuated the expression of VEGF, tumor necrosis factor-α, interleukin-1α, monocyte chemoattractant protein 1, cytokine-induced neutrophil chemoattractant 3, and MMP-9 protein; and downregulated ERK1/2, p38 MAPK, NF-κB activation, and HIF-1α expression in macrophages. The peritoneal cells elicited using mineral oil were highly purified macrophages, and the length and area of CNV were significantly decreased in the CNMs group compared with the control group. There was a significant reduction in the expression of VEGF and MMP-9 in activated macrophages and corneal tissue after pretreatment with CNMs in this model. In conclusion, CNMs potently suppressed macrophage-induced CNV via the inhibition of VEGF and MMP-9 expression. This effect might be mediated through attenuating macrophages via HIF-1α, MAPK, and NF-κB signaling pathways.
