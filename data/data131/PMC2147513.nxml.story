 1. The "chloride space" in frog skin was determined and found to be 69.7 per cent by weight of wet skin. The chloride space occupies about 94 per cent of the total water space of skin. From this and other information, it appears that the "non-chloride space" measures only a part of the space occupied by the structural elements of skin. This space is referred to here as the intracellular compartment and the remainder as the extracellular compartment of frog skin. On this basis, potassium and sodium in skin are distributed as follows: total sodium, 60 to 75 µeq./gm. of wet skin; all sodium is probably extracellular; total potassium, 39 to 49 µeq./gm.; intracellular potassium, 37 to 47 µeq./gm. 2. Skins were immersed in solutions differing from each other in their sodium and potassium concentrations. Three levels of NaCl were studied: 48, 119, and 169 µeq./ml. For each of these solutions (referred to below as diluted, physiological, and concentrated saline), the potassium levels were varied from 0.1 to 20 µeq./ml. For skins in solutions low in potassium and high in sodium, it was found that an exchange of intracellular potassium against extracellular sodium occurs. The ratio for the number of potassium ions lost/number of sodium ions gained was 4:1,4:6, and 4:8 for skin in K
