We are presenting a patient with multiple BCCs, located on the area of the scalp, who had been treated several years ago with electrocautery and curettage after histopathological verification. However, the last few years the tumours have advanced, infiltrating firstly the tabula external and a year later the tabula interna of the cranium. A computed -tomography (CT) imaging and radiography of the skull were performed to reveal the definite tumour localisation, needed for planning an one - step surgical intervention. Both of the instrumental examinations confirmed the existence of osteolytic tumour lesions. Craniotomy with precise removal of the BCCs infiltrating the cranial bone in all of its thickness was performed. Partial resection of dura mater was also performed also because intraoperative findings established the involvement of the dura. Histopathological verification revealed bone and dural invasion with clean resection margins. The bone defect was recovered with hydroxyapatite cement. Reconstruction as the shape of the skull was carefully modified and adapted to its initial size and form. Layered closure of the skin and soft tissues were performed after the complete removal of the BCCs. The postoperative period had no serious complications.
