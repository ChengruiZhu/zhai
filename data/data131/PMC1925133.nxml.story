As any child knows, to answer the question “how many,” one must start by adding up individual objects in a group. Extending beyond humans, this cognitive ability is shared by animals as diverse as birds and monkeys. Surprisingly, the exact brain mechanisms responsible for this process remain unknown. Damage to a brain area known as the parietal cortex disrupts basic mathematical skills, and functional imaging studies show that this area is activated when people perform basic computations. To understand how parietal cortex contributes to numerical behavior, we studied the activity of neurons in this area in monkeys while they looked at arrays of dots on a computer screen. We found that parietal neurons responded progressively as the total number of elements in the display was varied across a wide range of values (2–32). These neurons resemble “accumulator neurons” that have been suggested to serve as the first stage in counting. This information could be used by other neurons that respond best for a particular cardinal number, such as “4,” as has been reported in prior studies. Our findings support computer models that separate the processes of summing and numerical identification, and may also explain the fact that parietal cortex damage causes both numerical and spatial confusion.
