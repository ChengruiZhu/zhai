Repeat-proteins are coded in repetitions of similar amino acid stretches. Unlike typical globular domains, repeat-protein domains fold into elongated superhelical shapes of stacked elements, stabilized only by interactions within each repeat or between adjacent repeats. This architecture allows folding to be treated as a quasiâ€“one-dimensional problem. We introduce an analytical model that describes the folding energy landscape of repeat-proteins, based on a representation in terms of spin variables. This representation groups together conformations on the basis of the degree of order in local quasi-independent folding units, often called foldons. We derive simple relations between the experimentally observed stability and cooperativity of denaturation of the whole repeat-domain, which differ from those found in three-dimensionally connected globular proteins. Folding simulations on perfectly funneled landscapes reproduce these relations. We document that these relations are experimentally observed in a variety of repeat-protein systems. We show the parameters in the foldon spin description can be predicted on the basis, largely, of protein topology, reflecting the funneled energy landscape.
