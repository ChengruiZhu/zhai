Lipid metabolism is altered in several cancer settings leading to different ratios of intermediates. Ovarian cancer is the most lethal gynecological malignancy. Cancer cells disperse in the abdominal space and ascites occurs. T cells obtained from ascites are unable to proliferate after an antigenic stimulus. The proliferation of ascites-derived T cells can be restored after culturing the cells for ten days in normal culture medium. No pathway aberrancies were detected. The acellular fraction of ascites can inhibit the proliferation of autologous as well as allogeneic peripheral blood lymphocytes, indicating the presence of soluble factors that interfere with T cell functionality. Therefore, we analyzed 109 lipid mediators and found differentially regulated lipids in suppressive ascitic fluid compared to normal abdominal fluid. Our study indicates the presence of lipid intermediates in ascites of ovarian cancer patients, which coincidences with T cell dysfunctionality. Since the immune system in the abdominal cavity is compromised, this may explain the high seeding efficiency of disseminated tumor cells. Further research is needed to fully understand the correlation between the various lipids and T cell proliferation, which could lead to new treatment options.
