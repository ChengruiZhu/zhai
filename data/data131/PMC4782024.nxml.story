Bone metastasis occurs in the majority of late-stage tumors with poor prognosis. It is mainly classified as osteoblastic metastasis and osteolytic metastasis. The pathogenesis of osteolytic metastasis is a “vicious cycle” between tumor cells and bone cells (primarily the osteoclasts), which is mediated by secretory factors. The P62 adapter protein is a versatile multitasker between tumor cells and bone cells. The overexpression of P62 has been detected among a variety of tumors, playing positive roles in both tumorigenesis and metastasis. Moreover, P62 is an important modulator of the osteoclastogenesis pathway. Therefore, the ability of P62 to modulate tumors and osteoclasts suggests that it may be a feasible oncotarget for bone metastasis, especially for osteolytic metastasis. Recent research has shown that a P62 DNA vaccine triggered effective anti-tumor, anti-metastatic and anti-osteoporotic activities. Growing lines of evidence point to P62 as an emerging oncotarget for osteolytic metastasis. In this review, we outline the different roles of P62 in tumor cells and osteoclasts, focusing on the P62-related signaling pathway in key steps of osteolytic metastasis, including tumorigenesis, metastasis and osteoclastogenesis. Finally, we discuss the newest observations on P62 as an oncotarget for osteolytic metastasis treatment.
