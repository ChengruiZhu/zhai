Hypertension affects nearly one-third of all individuals in the US, yet one-half of all treated patients achieve blood pressure (BP) controlled to recommended goals. The percentage of patients with uncontrolled BP is likely to be much higher when considering the number of patients who are not even aware of their hypertensive state. Elevated BP is associated with increased risks of cardiovascular events and end-organ damage. Antihypertensive monotherapy is not always sufficient to achieve BP goals, and thus more aggressive treatment regimens need to be considered. Antihypertensive combination therapy, which may improve tolerability, offers the benefit of targeting different mechanisms of action. Numerous outcomes studies support the use of a reninâ€“angiotensin system inhibitor as a first-line choice in antihypertensive therapy. This review discusses the benefits of combination therapy with the angiotensin type II receptor blocker olmesartan medoxomil (OM) paired with the thiazide diuretic hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ). The pharmacokinetic properties of OM will be reviewed in addition to efficacy studies that support OM + HCTZ combination therapy over other possible antihypertensive combinations. Finally, a rationale for choosing HCTZ over another diuretic, chlorthalidone, will also be discussed based on pharmacokinetic differences, clinical concerns, and trends in use.
