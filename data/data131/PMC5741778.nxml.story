Suprascapular notch is characterized by variable morphology. However, its development is not well studied. We hypothesize that it proceeds postnatally. Thus, the aim of this research was to characterize the morphology of the suprascapular notch in a pediatric population based on computed tomography. A retrospective analysis was performed of 291 chest computed tomography examinations of patients under 18 years old taken following other clinical indications. The inclusion criteria were as follows: both scapulae encompassed in a field of view; no artifacts; no pathologies concerning the scapulae. Based on visual assessment and measurements, the suprascapular notch was classified according to a fivefold classification (type I, deeper than wider; type II, equally deep and wide; type III, wider than deeper; type IV, bony foramen; type V, discreet notch). In all, 173 examinations were included (60 females and 113 males). The most common suprascapular notch types were discreet notch (type V, 225 scapulae; 65.0 %) and type III (114 scapulae; 32.9 %). Children with type V suprascapular notch were significantly younger than children with other types (26.1 ± 42.4 months vs. 111.2 ± 66.7 months;
