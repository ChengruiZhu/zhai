MicroRNAs (miRs) are a type of small non-coding RNA molecule that are involved in gene silencing and the regulation of cancer progression; miR-133a in particular has been implicated in colorectal cancer, although its specific role and underlying mechanism have yet to be determined. In the present study, the expression level of miR-133a was significantly downregulated in a number of colorectal cancer cell lines, as well as in colorectal cancer tissues compared with the normal adjacent tissues. Furthermore, the Fascin1 (FSCN1) gene was identified as a direct target of miR-133a, and the protein expression level of FSCN1 was negatively regulated by miR-133a in colorectal cancer cells. Additionally, restoration of miR-133a expression and downregulation of FSCN1 protein expression suppressed colorectal cancer cell invasion, while overexpression of FSCN1 reversed the inhibitory effect of miR-133a upregulation on colorectal cancer cell invasion. Thus, the present data indicates that miR-133a may at least partially suppress colorectal cancer cell invasion, possibly via the inhibition of FSCN1 expression. The present study highlights the important role of miR-133a in the progression of colorectal cancer.
