The surface complex of Euglena has been examined intact and after isolation and purification by the use of mild sonication to disrupt cells. In intact cells the surface complex (pellicle complex) is oriented in a series of parallel ridges and grooves, and possesses among other components a characteristic group of four to seven microtubules. Isolated pellicles retain the ridge and groove pattern but no microtubules are present. Isolates yielded at least three major polypeptides on SDS acrylamide gels; one or more of the polypeptides are postulated to be identical with a submembrane layer present in both intact and isolated pellicles; one polypeptide appears to be in or on the surface membrane. Antibodies directed against the isolated pellicles were conjugated directly or indirectly to fluorescein, latex spheres, or ferritin. In appropriate experiments with these antibody conjugates, it has been found that antigenic sites are immobile and that new antigenic sites (daughter strips) are inserted between parental strips in replicating cells. These results together with direct observation of daughter strips by transmission electron microscopy suggest that surface growth in Euglena occurs by intussusception. Microtubules associated with the pellicle complex are postulated to play a role in the development of new daughter strips, and possibly also in cell movements.
