Treatment-emergent mutations and drug resistance were analyzed in virus from HIV-infected children meeting virologic failure (VF) criteria over 48 weeks following treatment with unboosted fosamprenavir or fosamprenavir/ritonavir-containing regimens in studies APV20002 and APV29005. Both antiretroviral therapy (ART)-naïve and ART-experienced patients were enrolled. Patients met VF criteria by either failing to suppress HIV-RNA to <400 copies/mL through week 24 or after confirmed viral rebound (≥400 copies/mL) anytime through week 48. Viral isolates were analyzed for treatment-emergent mutations or reduced drug susceptibility. Through week 48, 25/109 (23%) of APV29005 and 9/54 (17%) APV20002 study patients met VF. VF was more common in ART-experienced patients (68% and 78%, respectively). Major or minor treatment-emergent mutations were detected at VF in virus from 3 patients receiving unboosted fosamprenavir-containing regimens and in virus from 10 patients receiving fosamprenavir/ritonavir-containing regimens across the two studies. Major protease inhibitor mutations and the reverse transcriptase mutation M184V were detected at VF in virus from 4 and 5 patients, respectively, across both studies. Reduced drug susceptibility to any drug emerged in virus from 9 patients at VF, although reduced fosamprenavir susceptibility emerged in virus from only 4 patients (2 ART-naïve and 2 ART-experienced). No cross-resistance to the protease inhibitor darunavir was observed.
