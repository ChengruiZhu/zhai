 spinal cord ischemic model. The administration of Tat-PDIA3 significantly reduced the hydrogen peroxide-induced formation of reactive oxygen species and cell death, based on terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated biotinylated dUTP nick end labeling and a colorimetric WST-1 assay. Further, Tat-PDIA3 significantly ameliorated the ischemia-induced deficits in motor function, based on Tarlov’s criteria, 24–72 h after ischemia/reperfusion, as well as the degeneration of motor neurons in the ventral horn 72 h after ischemia/reperfusion. Tat-PDIA3 administration also reduced the ischemia-induced activation of microglia and lipid peroxidation in the motor neurons 72 h after ischemia/reperfusion. PDIA3 also potentially ameliorated the ischemia-induced increase in oxidative markers in serum and decreased the activity of Cu,Zn-superoxide dismutase, Mn-superoxide dismutase, and glutathione peroxidase in spinal cord homogenates, 24 h and 72 h after ischemia/reperfusion. These results suggest that Tat-PDIA3 could be used to protect spinal cord neurons from ischemic damage, due to its modulatory action on the oxidative/anti-oxidative balance. Tat-PDIA3 could be applicable to protects neurons from the ischemic damage induced by thoracoabdominal aorta obstruction.
