Individual phenotypes within natural populations generally exhibit a large diversity resulting from a complex interplay of genes and environmental factors. Since the advent of molecular markers in the 1980s, quantitative genetics has made a significant step toward unraveling the genetic bases of such complex traits, in particular by developing sophisticated tools to map the genomic locations of genes that affect complex traits. These regions are known as quantitative trait loci (QTLs). More recently, these tools have been extended to the study of gene expression phenotypes on a massive scale. In this paper, we used a previously published dataset consisting of expression measurements of 11,446 genes in human cell lines derived from 210 unrelated human individuals that have been genetically characterized by the International HapMap Project. Our article develops and applies a framework for determining the genetic factors that impact gene regulation. We show that these factors cluster strongly near to the gene start and gene end and are enriched within the transcribed region. Our approach suggests a general framework for studying the genetic factors that affect variation in gene expression.
