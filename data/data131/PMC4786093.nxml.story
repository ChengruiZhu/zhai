The universal genetic code is redundant, with some amino acids being encoded by up to six different codons. Synonymous codons are not used randomly and typically one codon is used more frequently than others. This biased use of codons has been observed in all branches of life. Codon bias is the result of long-term selection and is presumed to confer an evolutionary advantage. The nature of this selective advantage in free-living bacteria, where extreme bias is observed in highly expressed genes, is not fully understood. Furthermore, the magnitude of the fitness benefit of a single optimal codon is so small that it has never been measured experimentally. By systematically exchanging multiple codons at the same time we were able to increase the fitness effects of codon usage to a measurable level. Based on these data we determined the average strength of selection that acts on codon choice in highly expressed genes and show that codon usage bias is selected to optimize the speed of protein production. Quantification of codon usage bias deepens our understanding of the selective forces driving long-term genome evolution and might also find applications in the rational design of synthetic genes.
