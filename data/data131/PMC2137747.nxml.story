 Cells from lymph nodes of rabbits injected repeatedly with bovine serum albumin were transferred subcutaneously to previously irradiated rabbits, and the recipients were immediately injected with bovine serum albumin. A good antibody response resulted. In a series of such animals killed on successive days, skin samples at sites of cell deposition were removed and examined by immunofluorescence and by light microscopy. In these tissues abundant plasmocytes were found to have multiplied and differentiated in a regular progression from immature, to medium, to mature plasmocytes. During the 6 days of the experiment the small plasmocytes accumulated until they reached 85 per cent of the total plasmocytic population. The mitotic index of the large and medium plasmocytes averaged 11 per cent, implying a generation time of 6.3 hours on the basis of a 1 hour mitotic time. This rate of growth is sufficiently rapid to account for all the plasmocytes on the 6th day as deriving from less than 1 per cent of the population initially transferred. This rate and the orderly progression in the evolution of the plasmocytic population, make it highly improbable that plasmocytes arise from transformation of lymphocytes, but rather indicate that they spring from specific precursors already present among the transferred cells.
