Misregistration due to cardiac motion causes artifacts in two‐exposure dual‐energy subtraction images, in both the soft‐tissue‐only image and the bone‐only image. Two previous investigations have attempted to avoid misregistration artifacts by using cardiac gating of the first and second exposures. The severity of misregistration was affected by the heart rate, the time interval between the low‐ and high‐energy exposures, the total duration of the two exposures, and the phase of the cardiac cycle at the start of the exposure sequence. We sought to determine whether a commercial phantom with a simulated beating heart can be use to investigate the factors affecting misregistration in dual‐energy chest radiography. We made dual‐energy images of the phantom in postero–anterior orientation using the indirect digital radiography system (GE XQ/i). We acquired digital images at heart rates between 40 beats per minute and 120 beats per minute and transferred them to a computer, where the area of the artifact on the silhouette of the heart was measured from both soft‐tissue‐only and bone‐only images. For comparison, we measured misregistration in clinical dual‐energy subtraction images by the same method. Generally speaking, without synchronization of the exposure sequence with the cardiac cycle, the area of the misregistration artifact increased with heart rate for both the phantom and clinical images. However, the phantom exaggerated the magnitude of misregistration relative to clinical images. Although this phantom was designed for horizontal operation and computed tomography imaging, it can be use in an upright configuration to simulate heart motion for investigation of dual‐energy misregistration artifacts and control.
