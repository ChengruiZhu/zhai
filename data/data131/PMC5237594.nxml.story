 is considered as an evergreen genus distributed in tropical and subtropical Asia; this genus belongs to the large family of Lauraceae. In this study, the cell-death metabolism of biseugenol B was investigated. Nuclear condensation, cell permeability, mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) and release of cytochrome c have been detected in human prostate cancer cell line (PC3) treated with biseugenol B by high content screening (HCS). Fluorescent analysis was conducted to examine the reactive oxygen species formation. To determine the mechanism of cell death, the levels of Bcl-cell lymphoma (Bcl)-2 proteins, Bcl-2-associated X (Bax) protein and anti-apoptosis heat-shock protein 70 were tested by applying reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction and Western blot. Bioluminescent assays were also performed to assess the level of caspases such as 3/7, 8 and 9 during treatment. Furthermore, the involvement of nuclear factor kappa-B (NF-κB) was examined by Western blot and HCS. Biseugenol B showed significant cytotoxicity toward PC3 with no toxicity toward normal prostate cells (RWPE-1), which indicates that biseugenol B has qualities that induce apoptosis in tumor cells. The treatment of PC3 cells with biseugenol B provoked apoptosis with cell-death-transducing signals. Downregulation of Bcl-2 and upregulation of Bax regulated the MMP, which in turn caused the release of cytochrome c from mitochondria into cytosol. The release of cytochrome c activated caspase-9, which consequently activated caspase-3/7 with the cleaved poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase protein, thereby resulting in apoptosis alteration. Involvement of an extrinsic apoptosis pathway was exhibited by the increase in caspase-8, while the increase in caspase-3/7 and caspase-9 demonstrated involvement of an intrinsic apoptosis pathway. Meanwhile, no significant increase was observed in caspases 3/7, 8 or 9 in normal prostate cells (RWPE-1) after treatment with biseugenol B. Prevention of NF-κB translocation from the cytosol to the nucleus occurred in PC3 after treatment with biseugenol B. The results of our study reveal that biseugenol B triggers the apoptosis of PC3 cells via intrinsic and extrinsic apoptosis pathways and inhibition of NF-κB signaling pathway. Our findings suggest that biseugenol B is a potentially useful agent for prostate cancer treatment.
