Sensory imaging is a relevant issue in perception studies which is not yet fully understood. A specific sensory carrier's characteristics and how it interacts with pre-receptor structures to shape images are key aspects of all sensory systems. Comparative study leads to general concepts and a specialized jargon. Electric fish are widely used models for imaging studies and have led to important contributions in imaging research. We highlight the diversity of electric organ discharges as a source of different carriers subserving this active electric sense. Site specific differences in the organization of the electric organ of pulse Gymnotiformes results in a multi-directional “illumination” of objects in the surrounding environment. However, in both African and American species, there is a foveal region where the fields and the electric images show coherent waveforms that simplify the neural algorithms required for processing object images with high resolution. In addition, in American species the electric organs generate a complex field near the skin. This complex field tends to a dipolar form as it fades with distance from the electric organ, not very far away from the body. These features may have evolved as a cryptic adaptation of the electromotor system to deal with electroreceptive predators.
