Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNA) are thought to be important epigenetic regulators involved in the development of a variety of cancers. Alterations in lncRNA expression are associated with exposure to chemical carcinogens. However, it is still unclear whether lncRNA expression during lung carcinogenesis is induced by chemical carcinogens. In this study, using NNK-induced rat lung cancer model established by our previous study, we determined the lncRNA expression profiles, and an alteration in lncRNA expression was observed in lung cancer tissues and blood in the NNK treatment group. Using quantitative reverse-transcription PCR (qRT-PCR), five differentially expressed lncRNAs were further detected and validated. We identified a novel lncRNA, NR_026689, which showed increased expression in lung cancer tissues induced by NNK and the alteration of lncRNA NR_026689 was specifically observed in lung tissue. The level of NR_026689 was determined and significantly increased in rat whole blood at the 10th and 20th week after NNK treatment to evaluate it as a potential early marker for lung cancer. Together, these findings suggest that lncRNA NR_026689 may be a potential early biomarker for lung cancer and is associated with lung carcinogenesis induced by NNK.
