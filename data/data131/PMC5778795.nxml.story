Cluster of differentiation 147 (CD147), pituitary tumor transforming gene (PTTG) and CD44v6 are proteins involved in the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). To investigate the prognostic value of CD147 and PTTG, and CD44v6 expression in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC), tissue microarray specimens from 76 patients with ESCC were evaluated by immunohistochemistry staining and scored by intensity and proportion of positive areas. Expression levels of CD147, PTTG and CD44v6 were higher in tumor tissues than in matched adjacent tissues. CD147 expression was positively associated with lymph node metastasis (P=0.025) and American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) system clinical grades (P=0.037). CD147 expression was positively correlated with the expression levels of PTTG (R=0.369; P=0.001) and CD44v6 (R=0.320; P=0.005). In addition, Kaplan-Meier analysis indicated that positive expression of CD147, PTTG and CD44v6 was significantly associated with poor overall survival times (P=0.045, P=0.014 and P=0.027, respectively). Patients exhibiting CD147-PTTG co-expression, CD147-CD44v6 co-expression and CD147-PTTG-CD44v6 triple-positive expression had the poorest overall survival rates. In conclusion, the expression of EMT-associated proteins, including CD147, PTTG and CD44v6, was significantly associated with poor survival in ESCC and these novel targets may serve as potential biomarkers for anticancer therapies.
