Columns of neurons in the primary visual cortex (V1) are known to be tuned to visual stimuli containing edges of a particular orientation. The arrangement of these cortical columns varies across species. In many species such as in ferrets, cats, and monkeys a topology preserving map is observed, wherein similarly tuned columns are observed in close proximity to each other, resulting in the formation of Orientation Preference Maps (OPMs). The width of the hypercolumns, the fundamental unit of an OPM, also varies across species. However, such an arrangement is not observed in rodents, wherein a more random arrangement of these cortical columns is reported. We explore the role of astrocytes in the arrangement of these cortical columns using a self-organizing computational model. Invoking evidence that astrocytes could influence bidirectional plasticity among effective lateral excitatory connections in V1, we introduce a mechanism by which astrocytic inputs can influence map formation in the neuronal network. In the resulting model-generated OPMs the radius of the hypercolumns is found to be correlated with that of astrocytic arbors, a feature that finds support in experimental studies.
