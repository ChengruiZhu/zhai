With 1.67 million new cases and 522,000 deaths in the year 2012, breast cancer is the most common type of diagnosed malignancy and the second leading cause of cancer death in women around the world. Despite the success of screening programs and the development of adjuvant therapies, a significant percentage of breast cancer patients will suffer a metastatic disease that, to this day, remains incurable and justifies the research of new therapies to improve their life expectancy. Among the new therapies that have been developed in recent years, the emergence of targeted therapies has been a milestone in the fight against cancer. Over the past decade, many studies have shown a causal role of protein kinase dysregulations or mutations in different human diseases, including cancer. Along these lines, cancer research has demonstrated a key role of many protein kinases during human tumorigenesis and cancer progression, turning these molecules into valid candidates for new targeted therapies. The subsequent discovery and introduction in 2001 of the kinase inhibitor imatinib, as a targeted treatment for chronic myelogenous leukemia, revolutionized cancer genetic pathways research, and lead to the development of multiple small-molecule kinase inhibitors against various malignancies, including breast cancer. In this review, we analyze studies published to date about novel small-molecule kinase inhibitors and evaluate if they would be useful to develop new treatment strategies for breast cancer patients.
