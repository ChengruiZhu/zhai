Eukaryotic translation initiation factor 6 (eIF6) affects the maturation of 60S ribosomal subunits. Found in yeast and mammalian cells, eIF6 is primarily located in the cytoplasm of mammalian cells. Emerging evidence has demonstrated that the dysregulated expression of eIF6 is important in several types of human cancer, including head and neck carcinoma, colorectal cancer, non-small cell lung cancer and ovarian serous adenocarcinoma. However, the molecular mechanisms by which eIF6 functions during tumor formation and progression remain elusive. The present review focuses on recent progress in terms of the mechanisms and functions of eIF6 in human tumorigenesis or cancer cell lines, along with the signal transduction pathways in which this novel translation initiation factor may participate. Oncogenic Ras activates Notch-1 and promotes transcription of eIF6 via a recombining binding protein suppressor of Hairless-dependent mechanism. In addition, overexpression of eIF6 results in aberrant activation of the Wnt/Î²-catenin signaling pathway. Similarly, overexpressed eIF6 regulates its downstream modulator, cell division control protein 42, which in turn affects oncogenesis. Finally, the potential of eIF6 as a biomarker for diagnosis of cancer is also discussed in the present review.
