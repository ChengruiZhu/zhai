Ultimately, 64 studies, comprising 18,397 subjects from 49 case-control studies of the MspI genotype and 18,518 patients from 40 case-control studies of the exon 7 genotype, were included. A significantly elevated lung cancer risk was associated with 2 MspI genotype variants (for type C vs Type A: OR = 1.26, 95% CI = 1.12-1.42; for types B and C combined vs Type A: OR = 1.20, 95% CI = 1.13-1.28) in overall population. In the stratified analysis, a significant association was found in Asians, Caucasians, lung SCC, lung AC and Male population, not in mixed population, lung SCLC and Female population. However, inconsistent results were observed for CYP1A1 exon7 in our meta-analysis, two variants of the exon 7 polymorphism were associated with a significantly higher risk for lung cancer (for Val/Val vs Ile/Ile: OR = 1.24, 95% CI = 1.09-1.42; for (Ile/Val +Val/Val) vs Ile/Ile: OR = 1.15, 95% CI = 1.07-1.24) in overall population. In the stratified analysis, a significant assocation was found in Asians, Caucasians, lung SCC and Female population, not in mixed population, lung AD, lung SCLC and Male population. Additionally, a significant association was found in smoker population and not found in non-smoker populations for CYP1A1 MspI and exon7 gene.
