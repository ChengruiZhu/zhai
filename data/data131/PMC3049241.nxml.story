Solitary tracheobronchial papilloma (STBP) is a rare benign tumor that primarily involves the tracheobronchial tree. Human papilloma virus (HPV) infection is associated with dysplasia and a high risk of carcinoma in these lesions. The cytomorphology of STBP is not well established in the literature. Our aim is to characterize the cytomorphologic features of STBP, with histologic correlation in a series of 6 patients — 4 males and 2 females — with a mean age of 67 years (range, 53-88 years). There were 5 biopsy-proven squamous papillomas and 1 glandular papilloma. On surgical biopsy, squamous papillomas exhibited cytological atypia (4 graded mild and 1 graded moderate with focal severe dysplasia), surface erosion, and inflammation. Cytology specimens available for review included a combination of 4 fine-needle aspirations (FNAs), 2 bronchoalveolar lavages and 2 (of 3) bronchial brushings. Cytologic findings associated with squamous papillomas included atypical squamous cells and rare squamous cell resembling koilocyte in 1 bronchial brushing. Sheets of squamous cells were identified in another specimen. Several cases had a prominent background of acute inflammation, and candida was present in 1 specimen. HPV
