Hepatoid adenocarcinoma (HAC) is a rare and aggressive cancer subtype with a poor prognosis under metastatic conditions. Currently, there is no specific chemotherapy treatment protocol for advanced stages of the disease. This review evaluates two cases of HAC of gastric cardia with synchronous liver metastasis, which were successfully treated by chemotherapy with cisplatin (25 mg/m2 each day) (day 1 to day 3) and etoposide (100 mg/m2) (day 1 to day 3), every three weeks. A structured literary evaluation and reviewed pertinent articles are additionally presented to analyse the different approaches for the treatment of metastatic HAC (mHAC). The two described case reports demonstrated good partial responses to treatment and one of the two patients exhibited a good prognosis after a 9-year follow-up. A total of 20 case reports concerning the use of chemotherapy in mHAC were presented in the literature, 11 of which were regarding gastric HACs. The two aforementioned cases result in a total of 22 reports, 11 of which exhibited objective responses to chemotherapy, 8 patients demonstrated a partial response and 3 a complete response. The cisplatin-based regimen concerned 55% (12/22) patients and enabled 9 (75%) to exhibit a partial or complete response. A total of three patients exhibited a good prognosis in the long-term follow-up, all of them treated with a cisplatin-based regimen. It was demonstrated that the usual digestive regimens were not efficient in the treatment of HAC. In the absence of prospective trials, it may be hypothesized that cisplatin-based chemotherapy may be the most efficient first-line treatment in mHAC, with a 75% patient response, in accordance with the literature and follow-up cases.
