An MRI scan was carried out on 28 rotator cuff tear patients 2 days before the surgery. Humerus, rotator cuff tear, and rotator cuff tendon were manually traced. 3D-MRI data was acquired using a medical image processing, analysis, and visualization (MIPAV). Four orthopedic surgeons, 2 residents (resident G) and 2 shoulder surgeons, more than 100 case shoulder surgery experiences (shoulder surgeon G) reviewed the MRI imaging for each patient independently. The five rotator cuff tear shapes used in this study: crescent, reverse L, L shaped, trapezoidal, and massive tear (Ellman and Gartsman Classification). The four rotator cuff tear sizes used in this study: small < 1cm, medium < 3cm, large < 5cm, and massive > 5cm (Cofield Classification). All images from the 2D and 3D-MRI were separated. In the ﬁrst, the readers characterized the shape and size of the rotator cuff tendon tears by reviewing the 2D-MRI and blind to the intraoperative findings. Secondly, the 3D-MRI of each rotator cuff tear was reviewed, and shape and size of the tear were documented by each surgeon independently and blind to the intraoperative findings. These results were compared with the 2D-MRI imaging evaluation and intraoperative ﬁndings. (Figure 1)
