Periodic chronic myelogenous leukemia (PCML) is a dynamic hematopoietic disease which causes oscillations of circulating leukocytes, platelets and reticulocytes. Mathematical modeling is an invaluable tool to help in predicting hematopoiesis behavior. In this paper we modify the existing models based on improving the parameters of the model. Also more parameters are estimated regarding the proposed model. It is our major intention to construct a physiological model which can map major identified mechanisms of leukopoiesis to provide a deeper insight into this complex biological process. In the proposed model the leukocytes line has been modeled more precisely. In fact, precursor cells have been considered as two separate groups: proliferating precursor cells and non-proliferating precursor cells. As a result, more parameters have appeared in the model and identifying the new parameters has resulted in a better fit of clinical data and the data extracted from the model for both platelets and leukocytes. That is, the new model describes the leukocytes and platelets of the system in a way that is closer to clinical data, so the proposed model can be more useful for predicting the behavior of leukocytes and platelets for PCML disease. Compared with the previous works, it is shown that the new model has a better fit of the quantitative data on leukocytes and platelets.
