Rectovaginal fistula is a rare complication of ulcerative colitis (UC) regardless of surgical history of rectum. Various surgical treatment modalities for the closure of rectovaginal fistula have been developed, but a radically curative therapy remains to be developed. Recently, infliximab, the chimeric anti-human tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-Î±) antibody, has been largely applied for the treatment of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), and a few reports have shown its partial effectiveness in the management of rectovaginal fistulas associated with UC. In the present report, we describe the successful management of a rectovaginal fistula, following the stapled ileo-anal canal anastomosis in a UC patient, by administration of infliximab. The patient was a 40-year-old female, initially diagnosed as UC (total colitis type) at the age of 15. She received a restorative proctocolectomy at the age of 22, and developed a rectovaginal fistula at the eighth postoperative day. The surgical treatment of the fistula was repeated four times during the 10-year period, but it recurred in intervals ranging between 2 months and 5 years after the operation. The last recurrence occurred at the age of 32, but the surgical repair was considered difficult and a conservative management was indicated. At the age of 40, infusions of infliximab were started. Four weeks after the first infusion, drainage from the fistula was evidently reduced, and 2 weeks later, the fistula was completely closed. Thereafter, no recurrence of the fistula is observed, as confirmed by the abdominal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and the barium-enema study. From the present case, we concluded that infliximab may be an effective strategy for the management of fistulas associated with UC.
