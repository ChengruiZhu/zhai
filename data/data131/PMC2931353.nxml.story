-tagged chromosome 6 into breast cancer cell lines mediates suppression of tumorigenicity. In this study, we described the identification of KIAA1949 (phostensin) as a putative tumor suppressor gene. Our microarray analysis screened 25,985 cDNAs between a tumorigenic and metastatic breast cancer cell line MDA-MB-231 and the chromosome 6-mediated suppressed, non-tumorigenic and non-metastatic derivative cell line MDA/H6, resulting in the identification of 651 differentially expressed genes. Using customized microarrays containing these 651 cDNAs and 117 controls, we identified 200 frequently dysregulated genes in 10 breast cancer cell lines and 5 tumor tissues using MDA/H6 as reference. Our bioinformatics analysis revealed that chromosome 6 encodes 25 of these 200 genes, with 4 downregulation and 21 upergulation. Northern analysis validated microarray results and was used to detect the size and number of RNA species of 2 downregulated (KIAA1949, PTK7) and 2 upregulated (SFRS3, HMGN3) genes in the cell lines. Particularly, the KIAA1949 gene at 6p21.33, a band region with the frequent cytogenetic aberration and LOH encodes 4 poly(A)-RNA species (4.6-, 4-, 3- and 1.5-kb) in multiple normal and breast cancer samples. Microarray analysis revealed KIAA1949 downregulation in 86.7% (n=15) of breast cancer cell lines and tumor tissues. Northern analysis demonstrated undetectable and decreased expression of KIAA1949 in 100% (n=10) of breast cancer cell lines. Taken together, these results strongly suggest KIAA1949 is a novel candidate breast cancer suppressor gene.
