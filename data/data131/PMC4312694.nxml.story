Oral lesions show a wide range of biologic behaviours. There are various lesions which may mimic others and present in such an unusual manner thus making them very difficult to diagnose clinico-pathologically. An accurate diagnosis is not only important for correct treatment planning but also for determination of prognosis. Thus, it is very important for a surgical pathologist to be aware of the various atypical presentations of the lesions. 
The present unusual case report of basal cell adenoma occurring on upper lip with frank areas of calcifications and abundant inspissated mucoid secretions is an example of one such case.
BCA is an uncommon benign epithelial salivary gland neoplasm. It is one of the nine subcategories of salivary gland epithelial tumours according to WHO 2005 classification of salivary gland tumors. It is composed of basaloid cells organized with a prominent basal cell layer and distinct basement membrane-like structure and no myxochondroid stromal component as seen in pleomorphic adenomas.
To our best knowledge, no case in English literature has been reported BCA with exuberant inspissated mucoid secretions and frank areas of calcifications to such a large extent and this is the first case to report the same.
