 As revealed by electron microscopy and electron diffraction, the physical state of ferric hydroxide micelles contained in iron-dextran, saccharated iron oxide, and hydrous ferric oxide ("ferric hydroxide") differs notably from the state of the ferric hydroxide in ferritin or hemosiderin. By virtue of this difference one can trace the intracellular transformation of colloidal iron, administered parenterally, into ferritin and hemosiderin. One hour after intraperitoneal injection of iron-dextran or saccharated iron oxide into mice, characteristic deposits were present in splenic macrophages, in sinusoidal endothelial cells of spleen and liver, and in vascular endothelial cells of various renal capillaries. Four hours after injection, small numbers of ferritin molecules were identifiable about intracellular aggregates of injected iron compounds; and by the 6th day, ferritin was abundant in close proximity to deposits of injected iron compounds. The latter were frequently situated in cytoplasmic vesicles delimited by single membranes. These vesicles were most frequently found in tissue obtained during the first 6 days after injection; and in certain of the vesicles ferritin molecules surrounded closely packed aggregates of injected material. Much unchanged ferric hydroxide was still present in macrophages and vascular endothelial cells 3 to 4 weeks after injection. While electron microscopy left no doubt about the identity of injected ferric hydroxide on the one hand, and of ferritin or hemosiderin on the other, histochemical tests for iron failed in this respect. Precipitation of ferric hydroxide (hydrous ferric oxide) from stabilized colloidal dispersions of iron-dextran was brought about
