Neurons were originally divided into three morphologically distinct compartments: the dendrites receive the synaptic input, the soma integrates it and communicates the output of the cell to other neurons via the axon. Although several lines of evidence challenged this oversimplified view, neurons are still considered to be the basic information processing units of the nervous system as their output reflects the computations performed by the entire dendritic tree. In the present study, the authors build a simplified computational model and calculate that, in certain neurons, relatively small dendritic branches are able to independently trigger somatic firing. Therefore, in these cells, an action potential mirrors the activity of a small dendritic subunit rather than the input arriving to the whole dendritic tree. These neurons can be regarded as a network of a few independent integrator units connected to a common output unit. The authors demonstrate that a moderately branched dendritic tree of hippocampal granule cells may be optimized for these parallel computations. Finally the authors show that these parallel dendritic computations could explain some aspects of the location dependent activity of hippocampal granule cells.
