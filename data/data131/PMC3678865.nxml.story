Pedicle torsion of adnexal cysts results from the increased weight of cysts, longer length of the ovarian and suspensory ligaments or ovarian teratoma. Color doppler ultrasonography is particularly important for detecting suspected cyst torsion. Laparoscopy is becoming more important in the early diagnosis and treatment of adnexal cyst torsion due to its advantages, such as its minimally invasive nature, reduced acute stress reaction and facilitation of direct observation of intra-abdominal lesions. The present study analyzed 28 cases of laparoscopic torsion surgery. The laparoscopic conservative surgery rate was 75% and loss of endocrine function and fertility was avoided. Since the torsion duration is the only variable factor for avoiding oophorectomy, laparoscopic exploration should be performed as soon as possible when pedicle torsion of an adnexal cyst is suspected. Detorsion while retaining ovarian function did not increase the risk of thromboembolism and laparoscopic surgery was minimally invasive with faster recovery times and minimal impact on fertility. Furthermore, the study showed that the laparoscopic management of pedicle torsion of adnexal cysts is safe and reliable with the retention of ovarian endocrine and reproductive function.
