Riboswitches are RNAs that modulate gene expression by ligand-induced conformational changes. However, the way that sequence dictates alternative folding pathways of gene regulation remains unclear. In this study, we mimic transcription by computing energy landscapes which describe accessible secondary structures for a range of sequence lengths. Consistent with experimental evidence, we find that most riboswitch landscapes can be characterized by three broad classes as a function of sequence length in terms of the distribution and barrier type of the conformational clusters: Low-barrier landscape with an ensemble of conformations in equilibrium before encountering a substrate; barrier-free landscape with a dominant “downhill” pathway to the minimum free energy structure; and barrier-dominated landscape with two isolated conformational states with different functions. Sharing concepts with the “new view” of protein folding energy landscapes, we term the three sequence ranges above as the sensing, downhill folding, and functional windows, respectively. We find that these energy landscape patterns are conserved between riboswitch classes, though the order of the windows may vary. In fact, the order of the three windows suggests either kinetic or thermodynamic control of ligand binding. These findings help understand riboswitch structure/function relationships and open new avenues to riboswitch design.
