 century. Recent studies of gene expression levels in human tissue samples have indicated that multiple metabolic pathways are dysregulated in diabetes and in individuals at risk for diabetes; which of these are primary, or central to disease pathogenesis, remains a key question. Cellular metabolic networks are highly interconnected and often tightly regulated; any perturbations at a single node can thus rapidly diffuse to the rest of the network. Such complexity presents a considerable challenge in pinpointing key molecular mechanisms and biomarkers associated with insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes. In this study, we address this problem by using a methodology that integrates gene expression data with the human cellular metabolic network. We demonstrate our approach by analyzing gene expression patterns in skeletal muscle. The analysis identified transcription factors and metabolites that represent potential targets for therapeutic agents and future clinical diagnostics for type 2 diabetes and impaired glucose metabolism. In a broader perspective, the study provides a framework for analysis of gene expression datasets from complex diseases in the context of changes in cellular metabolism.
