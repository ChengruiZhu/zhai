Objective: Very few studies have been reported in the literature classifying the elongation and calcification patterns of styloid process. The present study was done to investigate the prevalence of elongation and calcification patterns of styloid process in patients attending a dental institution in south India. 
Study design: 600 digital panoramic radiographs of patients with dental problems were obtained from the outpatient department of the Dental institution. The apparent length of the styloid process was measured by a single experienced oral radiologist, with the help of the measuring tools on the accompanying software. The type of elongation and calcification patterns of each elongated styloid process was classified as per Langlai’s classification with few modifications. Finally the data was subjected to statistical analysis.
Results: Out of 520 measurable styloid processes (260 panoramic radiographs), 154 styloid processes had length greater than 3cm. The mean average length of elongated styloid process was 3.67±0.62 cm. No significant association was obtained between age and length of styloid process. In present study, the type of elongation pattern has no effect on the calcification pattern. Our results suggested that Type I elongated styloid processes were most likely to be completely calcified (type D), but statistically not significant. 
Conclusion: Type I pattern of elongation was found to be more prevalent in elder age group and was completely calcified in most of the cases. Interestingly, only three patients (out of 260) showed symptomatic elongation of styloid process. A relatively high prevalence of type IV elongation pattern (9 /154) was obtained in the present study, when compared to type III styloid process. Further large scale imaging studies are required to evaluate the presence of type IV elongation pattern in various population groups.
