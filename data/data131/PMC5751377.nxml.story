Lubrication of articular cartilage is a complex multiscale phenomenon in synovial joint organ systems. In these systems, synovial fluid properties result from synergistic interactions between a variety of molecular constituent. Two molecular classes in particular are of importance in understanding lubrication mechanisms: hyaluronic acid and phospholipids. The purpose of this study is to evaluate interactions between hyaluronic acid and phospholipids at various functionality levels during normal and pathological synovial fluid conditions. Molecular dynamic simulations of hyaluronic acid and phospholipids complexes were performed with the concentration of hyaluronic acid set at a constant value for two organizational forms, extended (normal) and coiled (pathologic). The results demonstrated that phospholipids affect the crosslinking mechanisms of hyaluronic acid significantly and the influence is higher during pathological conditions. During normal conditions, hyaluronic acid and phospholipid interactions seem to have no competing mechanism to that of the interaction between hyaluronic acid to hyaluronic acid. On the other hand, the structures formed under pathologic conditions were highly affected by phospholipid concentration.
