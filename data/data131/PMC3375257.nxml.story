Defects in mitochondrial function are associated with numerous age-related diseases including cancer and Parkinson's. Mitochondrial function relies upon maintenance of the mitochondrial proteome, which is comprised of nuclear and mitochondrial-encoded proteins. Nuclear-encoded polypeptides are translated in the cytosol and must be transported into the mitochondrial matrix, where resident chaperones facilitate folding into their functional conformation. In order to protect against dysfunction arising from an accumulation of misfolded or unfolded mitochondrial proteins, cells employ mechanisms to maintain the folding environment. One such signaling pathway is mediated by the bZip transcription factor ATFS-1, which upregulates mitochondrial chaperones to accommodate an overwhelming misfolded protein load. Here, we describe a complementary pathway that couples the mitochondrial functional status with the rate of cytosolic protein synthesis to protect the organelle from incoming unfolded protein substrates during mitochondrial stress. This pathway is regulated by the cytosolic kinase GCN-2, which phosphorylates the translation initiation factor 2α (eIF2α) subunit to slow general translation. GCN-2 responds to ROS emitted from dysfunctional mitochondria to promote growth and extend lifespan during mitochondrial stress.
