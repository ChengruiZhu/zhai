Membrane bound polysomes were prepared from HeLa cells infected with vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV), after pulse labeling with [3H]mannose for various times from 15 to 90 min. Oligosaccharides on nascent chains were released from peptides by treatment with endoglycosidase H and sized by high resolution Biogel P4 chromatography. Processing on some nascent chains proceeded to the removal of all three types of alpha- linked glucose and one alpha-1,2-mannose from the Glc3Man9GlcNAc precursor showing that the enzymes responsible were not only active on nascent chains but were present in the rough endoplasmic reticulum (RER). Incubation of cells for various times in cycloheximide, where chain elongation had ceased, made no difference to the profile of oligosaccharides on the nascent chains, and trimming proceeded no further than Man8GlcNAc2Asn . Carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazone (CCCP), an energy inhibitor reportedly able to block the transfer of glycoproteins from the RER, increases the amount of Man8- oligosaccharides on the nascent chains and also the amount of Glc3Man9GlcNAc precursor. On completed G protein in the RER fraction from which membrane bound polysomes were prepared, processing occurred to Man6 - but not to Man5GlcNAc sized oligosaccharides in the CCCP- treated cells. By contrast, processing to Man5GlcNAc oligosaccharides was observed in unfractionated control cells.
