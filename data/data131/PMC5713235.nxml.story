 polysaccharide (ASP), an acetone extract polysaccharide found as the major effective ingredients of a traditional Chinese medicinal herb named Chinese Angelica (Dong Quai), on oxidative damage of homo sapiens bone marrow/stroma cell line (HS-5) caused by 5-fluorouracil (5-FU), and the effect of ASP relieving oxidative stress in HM on SIPS of hematopoietic cells. Tumor-suppressive doses of 5-FU inhibited the growth of HS-5 in a dose-dependent and time-dependent manner. 5-FU induced HS-5 apoptosis and also accumulated cellular hallmarks of senescence including cell cycle arrest and typical senescence-associated β-galactosidase positive staining. The intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) was increased in 5-FU treated HS-5 cells and coinstantaneous with attenuated antioxidant capacity marked by superoxide dismutase and glutathione peroxidase. Oxidative stress initiated DNA damage indicated by increased γH2AX and 8-OHdG. Oxidative damage of HS-5 cells resulted in declined hematopoietic stimulating factors including stem cell factor (SCF), stromal cell-derived factor (SDF), and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), however, elevated inflammatory chemokines such as RANTES. In addition, gap junction channel protein expression and mediated intercellular communications were attenuated after 5-FU treatment. Significantly, co-culture on 5-FU treated HS-5 feeder layer resulted in less quantity of human umbilical cord blood-derived hematopoietic cells and CD34
