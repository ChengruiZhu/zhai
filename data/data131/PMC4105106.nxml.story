Smoke inhalation is the leading cause of death due to fires. When a patient presents with smoke inhalation, prompt assessment of the airway and breathing is necessary. Point-of-care ultrasonography (US) is used for the rapid assessment of critically ill or injured patients. We herein present a case report of a 54-year-old male who was transferred to the emergency department with shortness of breath, coughing, carbonaceous sputa, and rhinorrhea after inhaling smoke caused by a fire in his locked bedroom. He had no surface burns on the face and no edema or erosion in the oral cavity. He had hoarseness without stridor. His breath sounds were positive for expiratory wheezes. Laryngoscopy showed light edema and erosive findings on the supraglottic region. Bedside point-of-care US revealed hypoechoic thickening of the tracheal wall. The thickening was confirmed by a computed tomographic scan. The patient was carefully monitored with preparation for emergency airway management and was treated with supplemental oxygen and an aerosolized beta-2 adrenergic agonist in the intensive care unit. The symptoms were subsequently relieved, and reexamination by US after 2Â days showed remission of the wall thickening. Point-of-care US may therefore be a useful modality for the rapid diagnosis and effective follow-up of tracheal wall thickening caused by smoke inhalation.
