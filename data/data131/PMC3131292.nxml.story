 is an excellent model system for studying the internal circadian clocks that animals use for daily time keeping. Since clocks exist and function in animals not only in adults, but also during prior development, the question arises if and how adult circadian rhythms depend on developmental clock circuits and components. To address this question we created transgenic flies in which the essential clock components CLOCK/CYCLE (CLK/CYC) and PERIOD (PER) can be manipulated via environmental temperature. Stopping the clock during development by depleting the negative regulator PER did not prevent restoration of circadian time keeping in the adult. However, a developmental arrest of the clock due to either depletion of the positive regulator CYC or overproduction of PER resulted in a persistent loss of clock-controlled behavior function in adults. Taken together, these observations indicate that adult clock function developmentally requires activity of the CLK/CYC transcription complex rather than a ticking clock. Based on the behavioral, molecular, and anatomical consequences of inhibiting CLK/CYC in circadian pacemaker neurons, we propose that the developmental requirement maps to these cells. It will be interesting to determine whether there is a comparable developmental requirement for the equivalent clock genes in humans.
