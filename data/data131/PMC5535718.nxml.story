 mice. Expression of markers of stemness, differentiation, and epithelial-mesenchymal transition were estimated at RNA and protein levels in adherent parental cells and sphere-forming cells. Functional aspects and stemness features were compared with normal thyrocytes. Protein expression of xenograft tumors was evaluated by immunohistochemistry. B-CPAP sphere-forming cells were able to form thyrospheres theoretically indefinitely in an appropriate serum-free medium, reverting to the adherent parental cell phenotype when cultured in differentiation medium. Different expression of ALDH1-A1 and CD44 stemness markers and TTF-1 and CK19 differentiation markers allowed discrimination between isolated sphere-forming cells and adherent parental cells, indicating that sphere-forming cells retained stem-like features. In keeping with these observations, tumorigenicity assays confirmed that, relative to parental adherent cells, thyrospheres had enhanced capacity to initiate xenograft tumors. Thyrospheres from normal cell line retained very low functional capacity, as well as different stemness markers expression compared to tumor thyrospheres. Our findings may constitute a useful background to develop an
