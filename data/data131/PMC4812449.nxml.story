Growth-related oncogene (GRO)-β, or chemokine (C-X-C motif) ligand 2 (CXCL2), is a member of the CXC chemokine family that may mediate various functions, including attracting neutrophils to sites of inflammation, and participating in tumorigenesis and progression. However, the expression of GRO-β in colorectal cancer (CRC) and the association with the clinical outcome of the disease remains poorly understood. In the present study, CXCL2 mRNA expression in CRC was analyzed using six independent datasets from the Oncomine microarray database. The immunohistochemical analysis of tissue microarrays (TMA) was used to characterize the expression of the GRO-β protein in CRC. The association between GRO-β expression and the clinicopathological features and prognosis of patients was determined by statistical analysis. The results indicated that GRO-β was highly expressed in CRC tissues, and that high GRO-β cytoplasmic expression was associated with the tumor location, extent of the primary tumor, and lymph node metastasis. Kaplan-Meier survival and Cox regression analysis revealed that high GRO-β expression was an independent indicator of poor prognosis for CRC patients. The results indicate that high GRO-β expression in CRC may correlate with an unfavorable outcome and facilitate cancer cell invasion and metastasis.
