Previous studies show that caspase-6 and caspase-8 are involved in neuronal apoptosis and regenerative failure after trauma of the adult central nervous system (CNS). In this study, we evaluated whether caspase-6 or -8 inhibitors can reduce cerebral or retinal injury after ischemia. Cerebral infarct volume, relative to appropriate controls, was significantly reduced in groups treated with caspase-6 or -8 inhibitors. Concomitantly, these treatments also reduced neurological deficits, reduced edema, increased cell proliferation, and increased neurofilament levels in the injured cerebrum. Caspase-6 and -8 inhibitors, or siRNAs, also increased retinal ganglion cell survival at 14 days after ischemic injury. Caspase-6 or -8 inhibition also decreased caspase-3, -6, and caspase-8 cleavage when assayed by western blot and reduced caspase-3 and -6 activities in colorimetric assays. We have shown that caspase-6 or caspase-8 inhibition decreases the neuropathological consequences of cerebral or retinal infarction, thereby emphasizing their importance in ischemic neuronal degeneration. As such, caspase-6 and -8 are potential targets for future therapies aimed at attenuating the devastating functional losses that result from retinal or cerebral stroke.
