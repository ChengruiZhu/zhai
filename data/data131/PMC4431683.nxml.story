We use modern methods for injecting current data into epidemiological models in order to offer a probabilistic evaluation of the future influenza state in the U.S. population. This type of disease forecasting is still in its infancy, but as these methods become more developed it will allow for increasingly robust control measures to react to and prevent large disease outbreaks. While weather forecasting has steadily improved over the last half century and become ubiquitous in modern life, there is surprisingly little work on infectious disease forecasting. Although there has been a great deal of work in modeling disease dynamics, these have seldom been used to generate a probabilistic description of expected future dynamics, given current public health data. Moreover, the mechanism to update expected disease outcomes as new data becomes available is just beginning to receive attention from the public health community. Using CDC influenza-like illness reports and digital monitoring sources, such as observations of Wikipedia article access logs, we are now at a point where forecasting for the influenza season can begin to offer useful information for disease monitoring and mitigation.
