, has been found to have anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidative effects. However, its protective effects and mechanisms on liver injury have not been investigated clearly. This study takes an attempt to reveal the protective effects and mechanism of ADH on lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and D-galactosamine (D-GalN)-induced acute liver injury in mice. The mice liver injury model was induced by LPS (60 mg/kg) and D-GalN (800 mg/kg), and ADH was given 1 h after LPS and D-GalN treatment. Hepatic tissue histology was measured by H&E staining. Serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) levels were detected by detection kits. The levels of TNF-α and IL-1β were detected by ELISA. Moreover, malondialdehyde (MDA) and reactive oxygen species (ROS) contents were also detected. Meanwhile, the expression of Nrf2, HO-1, and NF-κB were detected by western blot analysis. The results showed that ADH treatment improved liver histology and decreased the levels of ALT, AST, MPO, IL-1β, TNF-α, as well as MDA and ROS levels of hepatic tissues in a dose-dependent manner. ADH also inhibited LPS/D-GalN-induced NF-κB activation. The expression of Nrf2 and HO-1 were increased by treatment of ADH. In conclusion, ADH protected against LPS/D-GalN-induced liver injury by inhibiting NF-κB and activating Nrf2 signaling pathway.
