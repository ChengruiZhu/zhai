Spatial interactions between distant genomic regions are of fundamental importance in gene regulation and other nuclear processes. Recent chromatin crosslinking (“Hi-C”) experiments probe the spatial organization of chromosomes on a genome-wide scale to an extent that was previously unattainable. These experiments report on contacting loci and thus provide information about the three-dimensional structure of the genome. Unfortunately, the data are noisy and do not determine the structure uniquely. There is also little quantitative prior knowledge about the large-scale organization of chromosomes. Here, we address these challenges by developing a Bayesian statistical approach that combines a minimalist polymer model with chromosome size measurements and conformation capture data. Our method generates statistical ensembles of chromosome structures from extremely sparse single-cell Hi-C data. We remove potential bias by learning modeling parameters from the experimental data and apply model comparison techniques to investigate which among a set of alternative models is most supported by the Hi-C data. Our method also allows for modeling with ambiguous contact data obtained on polyploid chromosomes, which is an important step towards three-dimensional modeling of whole genomes.
