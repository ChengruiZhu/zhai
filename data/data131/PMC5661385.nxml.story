The relationship between the expression levels of matrix metalloproteinase-2 (MMP-2) and MMP-9 and breast cancer prognosis was studied. Two breast cancer cell lines (MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7) and one human normal breast cell line (HS578Bst) were investigated. Fluorescence real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and western blotting were used to detect cellular mRNA and protein MMP-2 and MMP-9 expression levels. Breast cancer tissue samples from 80 patients and tumor-adjacent normal tissue samples from 40 patients were collected, and MMP-2 and MMP-9 expression in these samples were examined using immunohistochemistry (IHC). The relationship of MMP-2 and MMP-9 expression levels with breast cancer patient clinicopathological parameters and prognosis was analyzed. RT-PCR and western blot results showed that MMP-2 and MMP-9 mRNA and protein expression levels were significantly higher in MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7 cells than in HS578Bst cells. A high expression of MMP-2 and MMP-9 was found in 83.75% (67/80) and 78.75% (63/80) of breast cancer tissue samples, respectively. MMP-2 and MMP-9 expression in breast cancer tissues were significantly different from that in tumor-adjacent normal tissues (p<0.01). MMP-2 and MMP-9 expression levels in breast cancer tissues were correlated with lymph node metastasis and tumor staging. Single factor survival analysis showed that MMP-2 and MMP-9 were factors influencing breast cancer prognosis. MMP-2 and MMP-9 are highly expressed in breast cancer tissues and are closely related to lymph node metastasis and tumor staging. MMP-2 and MMP-9 can be used as reference indices for guiding breast cancer prognosis and treatment.
