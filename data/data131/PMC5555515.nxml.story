A total of 1524 patients were included in this study. The average patient age was 53.7 Â± 10.2 years, which was not significantly different between patients who did and did not experience a nerve complication (p=0.97). There were 1076 males and 445 females included. Subpectoral techniques were performed on 997 cases, while the tendon was tenodesed in the groove on 527 cases. Of the subpectoral LHBT tenodesis, 103 were drilled bicorically, while 682 were drilled unicortically. A total of 16 nerve injuries were encountered, and all nerve injuries were neuropraxias and recovered at terminal follow up. The musculocutaneous nerve was most often injured during subpectoral tenodesis (0.6% of cases), followed by the axillary nerve (0.3% of cases), and finally the radial, median, and ulnar nerves (0.2% of cases each). Significantly more nerve injuries were encountered for subpectoral techniques (15 of 982 cases, 1.53%) than suprapectoral techniques (1 of 526 cases, 0.19%) (OR 8.03, 95% CI 1.06-61, p=0.02). There was no difference between drilling unicortically versus bicortically with regard to nerve injury (OR 1.43, 95% CI 0.40-5.07, p=0.57). There was no difference in nerve injury between males and females (p=0.85).
