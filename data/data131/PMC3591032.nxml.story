To assess the potential use and benefits of Platelet-Rich Fibrin (PRF) over Platelet-Rich Plasma (PRP), for wound healing post oral and maxillofacial surgeries. This article describes the evolution of this second generation platelet concentrate and its multiple uses in various surgical procedures. Around 5 ml of whole venous blood is collected from the patients in each of the two sterile vacutainer tubes of 6 ml capacity without anticoagulant. The vacutainer tubes are then placed in a centrifugal machine at 3000 revolutions per minute (rpm) for 10 minutes, and the middle fraction containing the fibrin clot is then collected 2 mm below lower dividing line, to obtain the PRF. Cavities filled with PRF post oral and maxillofacial surgical procedures, at the institute, showed faster healing in half the time as compared to physiologic healing. PRF, which belongs to a new second generation of platelet concentrates, with simplified processing, and not requiring biochemical blood handling, has several advantages over traditionally prepared PRP, which has been widely used for accelerating soft tissue and hard tissue healing. However, the preparation being strictly autologous, the amount of PRF obtained is limited.
