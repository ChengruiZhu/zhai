Since the publication of the human and the chimp genomes, one of the major challenges in evolutionary biology has begun to be deciphered: namely, the search for positively selected genes that have shaped humanness. Arbiza and colleagues undertake a genomic-scale search for the genes that have been positively selected in human, in chimp, and in their common ancestral lineage. They conclude that events of positive selection were six times more frequent in chimp than in human, although they do not group under specific functional classes that have been preferentially selected in either species. However, in the comparisons of the evolutionary trends between the ancestral and the descendant lineages, they found that most of the relative differences in common classes show an abundance of positive selection on the human branch. By differentiating positive selection from a relaxation of selective constraints, both producing analogous footprints in the genome, they demonstrate that many of the genes previously thought to have been positively selected correspond to likely cases of relaxation. Finally, they quantify the bias produced by the use of average rateâ€“based approaches to concentrate cases of adaptive evolution in these species.
