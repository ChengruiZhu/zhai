Our objective was to evaluate recurrence patterns of hypopharyngeal and laryngeal carcinoma after chemoradiation and options for salvage surgery, with special emphasis on elderly patients. In a retrospective study all patients who underwent chemoradiation for hypopharyngeal and laryngeal carcinoma in a tertiary care academic center from 1990 through 2010 were evaluated. Primary outcome measures were the survival and complication rates of patients undergoing salvage surgery, especially in elderly patients. Secondary outcome measures were the predictors for salvage surgery for patients with locoregional recurrence after failed chemoradiotherapy. A review of the literature was performed. Of the 136 included patients, 60 patients had recurrent locoregional disease, of whom 22 underwent salvage surgery. Fifteen patients underwent a total laryngectomy with neck dissection(s) and 7 neck dissection without primary tumour surgery. Independent predictors for salvage surgery within the group of 60 patients with recurrent disease, were age under the median of 59 years (p = 0.036) and larynx vs. hypopharynx (p = 0.002) in multivariate analyses. The complication rate was 68% (14% major and 54% minor), with fistulas in 23% of the patients. Significantly more wound related complications occurred in patients with current excessive alcohol use (p = 0.04). Five-year disease free control rate of 35%, overall survival rate of 27% and disease specific survival rate of 35% were found. For the 38 patients who were not suitable for salvage surgery, median survival was 12 months. Patients in whom the tumour was controlled had a 5-year overall survival of 70%. In patients selected for salvage surgery age was not predictive for complications and survival. In conclusion, at two years follow-up after chemoradiation 40% of the patients were diagnosed with recurrent locoregional disease. One third underwent salvage surgery with 35% 5-year disease specific survival and 14% major complications. Older patients selected for salvage surgery had a similar complication rate and survival as younger patients.
