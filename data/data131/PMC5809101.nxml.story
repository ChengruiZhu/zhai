The history of populations and their social organization is often intricate due to breeding structures, migration patterns or population bottlenecks. Estimation of the female proportion of the effective population (sex ratio) is therefore important to better understand this underlying social structure and dynamics. This question has been mainly investigated so far by comparing genetic variation of mitochondrial DNA and the Y chromosome, two uniparentally inherited markers that reflect the demographic history of females and males, respectively. To overcome the intrinsic limitations of these genetic markers, and to take advantage of the increasing amount of sequence data, we propose a new approach that uses large numbers of independent polymorphisms from autosomes and the X chromosome to estimate sex ratios, throughout the history of populations. This method allows us to confirm a strongly female-biased sex ratio in modern dairy and beef cattle breeds. Yet, we find a strongly male-biased sex ratio during domestication times, consistent with an easier taming and management of cows, and/or introgression from wild auroch males. Analyzing human data from a sample of non-African populations, we find a male bias in Oceanians, possibly indicating complex marriage patterns among Aboriginal Australian groups.
