The identification of the TAR DNA-binding protein 43 (TDP-43) as the ubiquitinated cytoplasmic inclusions in frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD) and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) confirmed that these two diseases share similar mechanisms, likely to be linked to the abnormal hyperphosphorylation, ubiquitination and cleavage of pathological TDP-43. Importantly however, a quantitative analysis of TDP-43 inclusions in predilection cortical regions of FTLD, FTLD-ALS and ALS cases has not been undertaken. The present study set out to assess this and demonstrates that distinct TDP-43 inclusion morphologies exist in the anterior cingulate cortex, but not the motor cortex of FTLD and FTLD-ALS. Specifically, in the anterior cingulate cortex of FTLD cases, significant rounded TDP-43 inclusions and rare circumferential TDP-43 inclusions were identified. In contrast, FTLD-ALS cases revealed significant circumferential TDP-43 inclusions and rare rounded TDP-43 inclusions in the anterior cingulate cortex. Distinct TDP-43 inclusion morphologies in the anterior cingulate cortex of FTLD and FTLD-ALS may be linked to heterogeneity in the ubiquitination of pathological TDP-43 inclusions, with the present study providing evidence to suggest the involvement of distinct pathomechanisms in these two overlapping clinical syndromes.
