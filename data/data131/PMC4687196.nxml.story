Cervical cancer is the most common cancer among females in India. Cervical cancer usually spreads by local extension and through the lymphatic drainage to the lymph nodes. Hematogenous spread, the mechanism responsible for distant metastases, is rarely seen in cervical malignancies. In this communication, we report a case of a 45-year-old woman who presented with unilateral decrease in vision of 3 months duration. She was found to have a serous retinal detachment with underlying diffuse, subretinal yellowish-cream colored infiltrates in the right eye, suspicious of choroidal metastases. Systemic evaluation showed disseminated systemic metastases arising from a primary adenocarcinoma of the cervix. In this communication, we review all the documented cases of metastases to the eye and adnexa arising from cervical cancer and their clinical characteristics. Unilateral choroidal metastasis arising from an adenocarcinoma of the cervix is extremely rare with only one previous documented case. Although uncommon, choroidal metastasis may be the presenting feature of primary cervical malignancy. Furthermore, cervical malignancy must be ruled out in women who present with orbital or choroidal metastases arising from unknown primary.
