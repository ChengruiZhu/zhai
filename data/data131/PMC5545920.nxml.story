Microvascular lesions including cortical microinfarctions (CMIs) and cerebral lobar microbleeds (CMBs) are usually caused by cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA) in the elderly and are correlated with cognitive decline. However, their radiological-histopathological coincidence has not been revealed systematically with widely used 3-Tesla (3T) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The purpose of the present study is to delineate the histopathological background corresponding to MR images of these lesions. We examined formalin-fixed 10-mm thick coronal brain blocks from 10 CAA patients (five were also diagnosed with Alzheimer’s disease, three with dementia with Lewy bodies, and two with CAA only) with dementia and six non CAA patients with neurodegenerative disease. Using 3T MRI, both 3D-fluid attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) and 3D-double inversion recovery (DIR) were examined to identify CMIs, and T2* and susceptibility-weighted images (SWI) were examined to identify CMBs. These blocks were subsequently examined histologically and immunohistochemically. In CAA patients, 48 CMIs and 6 lobar CMBs were invariably observed in close proximity to degenerated Aβ-positive blood vessels. Moreover, 16 CMIs (33%) of 48 were detected with postmortem MRI, but none were seen when the lesion size was smaller than 1 mm. In contrast, only 1 undeniable CMI was founded with MRI and histopathology in 6 non CAA patients. Small, cortical high-intensity lesions seen on 3D-FLAIR and 3D-DIR images likely represent CMIs, and low-intensity lesions in T2* and SWI correspond to CMBs with
