Motor control depends on the brain's awareness of the current state of the body. Knowing the current position and movement of the arm, for example, allows one to reach rapidly and accurately towards a target. However, sensory information reaches the brain only after a short delay, and the arm may already be in motion. Therefore, it has been proposed that the brain must calculate a “state estimate”—by combining sensory information about the last known position of the arm with predictions of its responses to recent movement commands—which it uses to accurately plan and control a reaching movement. To test this idea, we used transcranial magnetic stimulation to briefly disrupt several separate areas in the brain as participants reached to a target. We show that stimulation over the cerebellum caused reaching errors consistent with movements planned on the arm's position about 140 ms previously, whereas stimulation of other brain areas did not disrupt reaching direction. These results add weight to the hypothesis that the cerebellum predicts the state of the motor system. This hypothesis can explain the loss of movement control experienced by cerebellar patients and supports computational theories that the cerebellum is a predictive model of the motor system.
