. EDTA and trypsin were utilized to investigate the attachment ability of these cells. Moreover, the expression of epithelial mesenchymal transition (EMT) markers (β-catenin, Slug, vimentin, Snail, claudin, E-cadherin and N-cadherin) was assessed by western blotting and immunofluorescence in ES-2 and SKOV3 cells. Furthermore, β-hCG and EMT markers were evaluated in human ovarian cancer specimens by IHC. The results showed that overexpression of β-hCG clearly promoted migration and invasion in ES-2 and SKOV3 cells (P<0.05) and facilitated metastasis in peritoneal xenografts, while silencing of β-hCG led to the opposite effect. Moreover, β-hCG was closely associated with cell morphology, attachment ability and EMT marker expression in ES-2 and SKOV3 cells and human ovarian cancer specimens. Upregulation of β-hCG promoted cells from an epithelial-like morphology to a mesenchymal-like phenotype, decreased the adhesion ability (P<0.05), and reduced the expression of epithelial markers (E-cadherin) while inducing the expression of mesenchymal markers (vimentin, N-cadherin, β-catenin and Slug). Furthermore, the converse effects were confirmed by knockdown of β-hCG. These findings strongly suggest that β-hCG may regulate metastasis of ovarian cancer through EMT, and it may become a new target for therapeutic intervention.
