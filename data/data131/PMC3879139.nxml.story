Sensory neurons encode information about the world into sequences of spiking and silence. Multi-electrode array recordings have enabled us to move from single units to measuring the responses of many neurons simultaneously, and thus to ask questions about how populations of neurons as a whole represent their input signals. Here we build on previous work that has shown that in the salamander retina, pairs of retinal ganglion cells are only weakly correlated, yet the population spiking activity exhibits large departures from a model where the neurons would be independent. We analyze data from more than a hundred salamander retinal ganglion cells and characterize their collective response using maximum entropy models of statistical physics. With these models in hand, we can put bounds on the amount of information encoded by the neural population, constructively demonstrate that the code has error correcting redundancy, and advance two hypotheses about the neural code: that collective states of the network could carry stimulus information, and that the distribution of neural activity patterns has very nontrivial statistical properties, possibly related to critical systems in statistical physics.
