Hyperglycemia is the main determinant of long term diabetic complications mainly through induction of oxidative stress responsible for secondary defects including cancer, infertility etc. Thiazolidinediones (TZDs) are known to posses the antioxidant potential against the reactive oxygen species. The ability of clinically used TZDs like Rosiglitazone (RSG) and Pioglitazone (PIO) in diabetic complications is still need to be studied extensively in the literature. In this study, the role of RSG and PIO on the frequency of nuclear and germinal cell damage was studied using bone marrow micronucleus (MN) test, sperm shape abnormality and sperm count in normal animals. The drugs were tested in the three doses (1, 10 and 100 mg/kg) after acute (48 hrs and 72 hrs) and chronic (4 weeks) treatment. The results indicated that RSG has produced significant (p < 0.01) decrease in P/N (polychromatic and normochromatic erythrocytes) ratio at 10 and 100 mg/kg without affecting the frequency of micronucleated erythrocytes, sperm shape morphology and sperm count. PIO in the tested doses did not induce any change in P/N ratio and sperm count but the higher dose (100 mg/kg) showed suppression of MN in normochromatic erythrocytes and % sperm shape abnormality compared to the control group.
