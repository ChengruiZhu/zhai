We know of a large number of diseases or medical conditions that affect humans more severely than non-human primates, such as AIDS, malaria, hepatitis B, and cancer. These differences likely arise from different immune responses to infection among species. However, due to the lack of comparative functional data across species, it remains unclear how the immune system of humans and other primates differ. In this work, we present the first genome-wide characterization of functional differences in innate immune responses between humans and our closest evolutionary relatives. Our results indicate that “core” immune responses, those that are critical to fight any invading pathogen, are the most conserved across primates and that much of the divergence in immune responses is observed in genes that are involved in response to specific microbial and viral agents. In addition, we show that human-specific immune responses are enriched for genes involved in apoptosis and cancer biology, as well as with genes previously associated with susceptibility to infectious diseases or immune-related disorders. Finally, we find that chimpanzee-specific immune signaling pathways are enriched for HIV–interacting genes. Our observations may therefore help explain known inter-species differences in susceptibility to infectious diseases.
