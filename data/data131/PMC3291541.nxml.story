Human cells sample short peptides from endogenous proteins, and present them to the immune system via HLA class I molecules on the cell surface. T-cells scan the presented peptides and need to discriminate foreign (nonself) peptides from human (self) peptides. We show that this is a difficult task, despite the exquisite specificity of T-cells. We estimate, using HLA-peptide binding predictions and T-cell recognition models, that almost a third of the nonself peptide-HLA complexes is so similar to a self peptide-HLA that a T-cell cannot tell them apart. Since T-cells have to ignore self peptides to prevent autoimmunity, we estimate that at least a third of the foreign peptides has to be ignored as well, and therefore fails to evoke an immune response. Foreign peptides that are never used in immune responses, have been referred to as the “holes in the repertoire”. Since the sizes of the holes we predict agree with those that were previously found, our conjecture is that the holes are entirely due to similarity with self peptides. We test this conjecture with public data on HIV-1 and vaccinia responses, and confirm that self similarity is a major determinant of the immune response to nonself peptides.
