Osteosarcoma (OS) is a rare primary malignant bone tumour arising from primitive bone-forming mesenchymal cells, with high incidence in children and young adults, accounting for approximately 60% of all malignant bone tumours. Currently, long-term disease-free survival can be achieved by surgical treatment plus chemotherapy in approximately 60% of patients with localized extremity disease, and in 20â€“30% of patients with metastatic lung or bone disease. Diagnosis of primary lesions and recurrences is achieved by using radiological investigations and standard tissue biopsy, the latter being costly, painful and hardly repeatable for patients. Therefore, despite some recent advances, novel biomarkers for OS diagnosis, prediction of response to therapy, disease progression and chemoresistance, are urgently needed. Biological fluids such as blood represent a rich source of non-invasive cancer biomarkers, which allow to understand what is really happening inside the tumour, either at diagnosis or during disease progression. In this regard, liquid biopsy potentially represents an alternative and non-invasive method to detect tumour onset, progression and response to therapy. In this review, we will summarize the state of the art in this novel area, illustrating recent studies on OS. Although the data reported in literature seem preliminary, liquid biopsy represents a promising tool with the potential to be rapidly translated in the clinical practice.
