To deal with an uncertain and complex world, animals have developed a large repertoire of behavioral heuristics and default strategies that spring into action in unknown situations. Building on this a priori repertoire, animals may find various ways to succeed on a given behavioral task. Therefore, determining the exact behavioral strategy followed during a task may be essential for understanding the cognitive processes involved. Using computational models to analyze behavior, we examined how a genetic variation in a gene that encodes a calcium channel and has been associated with learning deficits influences the way in which animals acted on a task in which a reward was associated with a specific behavior. We found that a knockout of the relevant gene does not lead to a general learning impairment but rather led animals to adopt a behavioral strategy different from the one employed by the control animals. Specifically, knockout animals managed to increase their reward returns by basing their responses more on the previous reward location rather than on reward-indicating stimuli, like the controls did. These findings may prove useful for behavioral therapy in the context of psychiatric disorders associated with this specific gene variation.
