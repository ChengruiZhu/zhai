The basic principle of neo-Darwinian genetics is that mutations occurring during growth enable the subsequent survival of the mutants under selective environmental conditions. However, new mutants can arise from a non-growing bacterial population during selection in an apparently Lamarckian way. The phenomenon is called adaptive mutation. In one suggested pathway, retromutagenesis, a damaged gene produces a mutant protein that enables enough growth for a mutant gene to be copied onto daughter chromosomes. This hypothesis is supported by evidence that, in several experimental systems, a damaged gene can produce a mutant protein rather than no protein at all, and that both RNA and DNA polymerase will pair the same base with a lesion. Because this model requires gene expression before DNA synthesis, a third feature is predicted: in a non-growing population, adaptive mutations will occur preferentially on the transcribed strand of a gene. In this paper, we describe a bacterial genetic system that can distinguish between mutations occurring on either DNA strand, and we use it to confirm this prediction. The findings enhance our general understanding of evolution in all organisms, the majority of which are in a non-growing state most of the time.
