These findings show that bariatric surgery delivered in routine clinical practice in the UK is associated with a substantial initial weight loss that is sustained for at least four years after surgery. They also show that bariatric surgery is associated with improvements in pre-existing type 2 diabetes and hypertension and with a reduced risk of developing several obesity-related co-morbidities. Because the data used in the study were recorded for patient management by primary care physicians, the researchers were unable to use strict diagnostic criteria for some outcomes, which may limit the accuracy of these findings. Nevertheless, these results suggest that widening the availability of bariatric surgery in the UK could provide substantial health benefits for many people who are morbidly obese. Indeed, the researchers calculate that, if the associations seen in this study are causal (an observational study cannot prove that a treatment causes a specific outcome), bariatric surgery could prevent and/or resolve many tens of thousands of cases of hypertension and type 2 diabetes and prevent similar numbers of cases of other obesity-related illnesses among the 1.4 million morbidly obese people living in the UK.
