 cells. The fluorescence intensity of intracellular MPPa was observed by fluorescence microscopy and quantified using microplate reader. The protein levels were assessed by western blotting (WB). Compared with two parental cells, MG63/PDT and HOS/PDT were 1.67- and 1.61-fold resistant to MPPa-PDT, respectively, and also exhibited the resistance to CDDP. FCM assays confirmed that both MG63/PDT and HOS/PDT cells treated with MPPa-PDT displayed a significantly lower apoptosis rate in comparison with their corresponding parental cells. The expression of apoptosis-related proteins (i.e. cleaved-caspase 3 and cleaved-PARP), intracellular ROS and the antioxidant proteins (HO-1 and SOD1) in MG63/PDT and HOS/PDT cells was also lower than that in parental cells. Both MG63/PDT and HOS/PDT cells exhibited changes in proliferation, photosensitizer absorption, colony formation, invasion, migration and the cell cycle distribution as compared to MG63 and HOS cells, respectively. Compared to MG63 and HOS cells, both resistant cell lines had a higher expression of CD133, survivin, Bcl-xL, Bcl-2, MRP1, MDR1 and ABCG2, but a lower expression of Bax. The present study successfully established two resistant human osteosarcoma cell lines which are valuable to explore the resistance-related mechanisms and the approaches to overcome resistance.
