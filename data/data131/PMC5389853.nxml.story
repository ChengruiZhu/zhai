In all organisms, diverse classes of RNA perform a wide range of functions, including programing of protein synthesis, transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulation of gene expression and forming key structural and functional components for pre-mRNA splicing, ribosome synthesis and translation. In consequence, control of the quantity and quality of RNA synthesis and maturation is of key importance. In Eukaryotes, the RNA exosome complex plays a major role in both degradation of aberrant RNA molecules and maturation of functional RNAs. The exosome has a barrel-like structure, with a central channel through which RNAs are threaded to the exonuclease active site of Rrp44. However, in a different exosome conformation, RNAs can also directly access the Rrp44 active site. Here we report the interaction of RNAs with different exosome components and its major cofactor Mtr4 in wild type and mutant strains of yeast. We identified numerous RNAs with clear channel specificities, whereas channel-threaded and direct access routes cooperated for many other substrates. The pathway used by RNA to access Rrp44 reflects the nature and structure of the RNA and whether it is addressed to the exosome for accurate processing or complete degradation, helping us to understand these crucial but highly complex pathways
