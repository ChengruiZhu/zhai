A lawful disposal of human dead body is only possible after establishment of proper and valid cause of death. If the cause is obscure, autopsy is the only mean of search. Inadequacy and unavailability of health care facility often makes this situation more complicated in developing countries where many deaths remain unexplained and proper mortality statistics is missing, especially for infant and children. Tissue sampling by needle autopsy or use of various imaging technique in virtopsy have been tried globally to find out an easier alternative. An exclusive and unique initiative, by limited autopsy through tissue biopsy and body fluid analysis, has been taken to meet this dire need in African and some of Asian developing countries, as worldwide accepted institutional data are even missing or conflicting at times. Traditional autopsy has changed little in last century, consisting of external examination and evisceration, dissection of organs with identification of macroscopic pathologies and injuries, followed by histopathology. As some population groups have religious objections to autopsy, demand for minimally invasive alternative has increased of late. But assessment of cause of death is most important for medico-legal, epidemiological and research purposes. Thus minimally invasive technique is of high importance in primary care settings too. In this article, we have made a journey through different autopsy methods, their relevance and applicability in modern day perspective considering scientific research articles, textbooks and interviews.
