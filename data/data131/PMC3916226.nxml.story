Inducing heat shock or overexpressing certain heat shock proteins (HSPs) is known to protect against brain injury, such as that resulting from stroke. Understanding the mechanisms underlying protection at the cellular and molecular level is a subject of intense research, as such knowledge may prove beneficial in designing future therapies. Regulation of the activation of the key inflammatory transcription factor Nuclear Factor κB (NF-κB) is believed to be one critical mechanism. However how its activation is altered by Hsp72 remains unresolved. Here we examine NF-κB signaling in microglia cells overexpressing Hsp72, combining experimentation and mathematical modeling. We show that Hsp72 affects signaling using at least two essential and distinct mechanisms: attenuation of upstream kinase (IKK) activity and reduction of steady state NF-κB protein levels. We provide numerical evidence suggesting that neither mechanism in isolation is sufficient to account for the observed signaling. Furthermore, our observations suggest an intriguing additional level of regulation of gene expression and protein synthesis of the IκBα inhibitor, which opens interesting new avenues of research. These results provide novel insight into the mechanisms by which Hsp72 may regulate inflammation and protect brain cells from injury.
