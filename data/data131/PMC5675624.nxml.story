Platelets in the primary tumor microenvironment play crucial roles in regulating tumor growth, metastasis, and angiogenesis, but the underlying mechanisms are unclear. Here, we show that platelet releasates exhibited a proliferative effect on HeLa cells, and this effect correlated with a reduction of KLF6 expression. After incubation with either washed human platelets or collagen-related peptide (CRP) activated platelet releasates, expression of KLF6 in the HeLa cervical tumor cell line was markedly reduced. However, no significant difference was observed between control HeLa cells and HeLa cells incubated with resuspended activated platelet pellet. Moreover, the platelets’ promoting effect on HeLa cell growth was significantly abolished in KLF6 silenced HeLa cells. In addition, blocking TGF-β signaling with SB431542, a TGF-β receptor inhibitor, also counteracted the effect of platelets on proliferation and KLF6 expression in HeLa cells. From these findings, we conclude that platelet derived TGF-β promotes proliferation of HeLa cells by decreasing the expression of KLF6. The discovery that KLF6 is a key target of platelet-derived TGF-β signaling in HeLa cells identifies a potential new therapeutic target for the prevention and treatment of cervical carcinoma.
