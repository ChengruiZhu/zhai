Recent progress in the field of sequencing and analysis has led to a tremendous spike in data and the development of data science tools. One of the outcomes of this scientific progress is development of numerous databases which are gaining popularity in all disciplines of biology including sericulture. As economically important organism, silkworms are studied extensively for their numerous applications in the field of textiles, biomaterials, biomimetics, etc. Similarly, host plants, pests, pathogens, etc. are also being probed to understand the seri-resources more efficiently. These studies have led to the generation of numerous seri-related databases which are extremely helpful for the scientific community. In this article, we have reviewed all the available online resources on silkworm and its related organisms, including databases as well as informative websites. We have studied their basic features and impact on research through citation count analysis, finally discussing the role of emerging sequencing and analysis technologies in the field of seri-data science. As an outcome of this review, a web portal named SeriPort, has been created which will act as an index for the various sericulture-related databases and web resources available in cyberspace.
