Osteoporosis, which is a systemic skeletal disease characterized by low bone mineral density and microarchitectural deterioration of bone quality, is a global and increasing public health problem. Recent studies have suggested that Tenuigenin (TEN), a class of native compounds with numerous biological activities such as anti-resorptive properties, exerts protective effects against postmenopausal bone loss. The present study aims to investigate the osteogenic effects of TEN on bone mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs) in vitro and in vivo. Alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity/staining, Alizarin red staining and the expression of osteogenic markers, including runt-related transcription factor 2, osterix, osteocalcin, collagen Iα1, β-catenin and glycogen synthase kinase-3β were investigated in primary femoral BMSCs from C57/BL6 mice cultured under osteogenic conditions for 2 weeks to examine the effects of TEN. An ovariectomized (OVX) mouse model was used to investigate the effect of TEN treatment for 3 months in vivo. We found that ALP activity, mineralized nodules and the expression of osteogenic markers were increased and WNT/β-catenin signaling was enhanced in vitro and in vivo. Bone parameters, including trabecular thickness, trabecular number and bone mineral density were higher in the OVX+TEN group than in control OVX mice. Our results suggest the therapeutic potential of TEN for the treatment of patients with postmenopausal osteoporosis.
