The cytokine Granulocyte–Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor (GM-CSF) regulates proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis during myelopoiesis and erythropoiesis. Structure–function relationships of GM-CSF interactions with its receptor (GM-R), the biochemistry of GM-R signal transduction, and GM-CSF action in vivo are relatively well understood. Much less is known, however, about GM-R function in primary hematopoietic cells. In this paper we show that expression of the human GM-R in a heterologous cell system (primary avian erythroid and myeloid cells) confirms respective results in murine or human cell lines, but also provides new insights how the GM-R regulates progenitor proliferation and differentiation. As expected, the hGM-CSF stimulated myeloid progenitor proliferation and differentiation and enhanced erythroid progenitor proliferation during terminal differentiation. In the latter cells, however, the hGM-R only partially substituted for the activities of the erythropoietin receptor (EpoR). It failed to replace the EpoR in its cooperation with c-Kit to induce long-term proliferation of erythroid progenitors. Furthermore, the hGM-R α chain specifically interfered with EpoR signaling, an activity neither seen for the β
