How we comprehend speech—and how the brain encodes information from a continuous speech stream—is of interest for neuroscience, linguistics, and research on language disorders. Previous work that examined dynamic brain activity has addressed the issue of comprehension only indirectly, by contrasting intelligible speech with unintelligible speech or baseline activity. Recent work, however, suggests that brain areas can show similar stimulus-driven activity but differently contribute to perception or comprehension. To directly address the perceptual relevance of dynamic brain activity for speech encoding, we used a straightforward, single-trial comprehension measure. Furthermore, previous work has been vague regarding the analysed timescales. We therefore base our analysis directly on the timescales of phrases, words, syllables, and phonemes of our speech stimuli. By incorporating these two conceptual innovations, we demonstrate that different areas of the brain track acoustic information at the time-scales of words and phrases. Moreover, our results suggest that the motor cortex uses a cross-frequency coupling mechanism to predict the timing of phrases in ongoing speech. Our findings suggest spatially and temporally distinct brain mechanisms that directly shape our comprehension.
