Illusory self-motion (vection) can be generated by visual stimulation. The purpose of the present study was to compare behavioral vection measures including intensity ratings, duration, and onset time across different visual display types. Participants were exposed to a pattern of alternating black-and-white horizontal or vertical bars that moved either in vertical or horizontal direction, respectively. Stimuli were presented on four types of displays in randomized order: (a) large field of view dome projection, (b) combination of three computer screens, (c) single computer screen, (d) large field of view flat projection screen. A Computer Rod and Frame Test was used to measure field dependence, a cognitive style indicating the person’s tendency to rely on external cues (i.e., field dependent) or internal cues (i.e., field independent) with respect to the perception of one’s body position in space. Results revealed that all four displays successfully generated at least moderately strong vection. However, shortest vection onset, longest vection duration, and strongest vection intensity showed for the dome projection and the combination of three screens. This effect was further pronounced in field independent participants, indicating that field dependence can alter vection.
