Ten separate data sources were selected for inclusion in the study based on a number of criteria, including availability, representativeness, population, data structure and content, cost, and longitudinality. In collaboration with staff from seven Divisions across the CDC, detailed specifications were developed for twenty separate indicators of healthcare utilization or preventive services using best practices in healthcare quality measurement. Specifications were developed separately for EHR and medical claims data due to their differing structure, content and use of medical code sets and terminologies. Specifications for EHR data sources relied on the National Quality Forum (NQF) Meaningful Use (MUse) clinical quality measure specifications. The use of NQF MUse specification guidelines allowed us to gauge the current ability of each data source to measure healthcare utilization and preventive services as recommended by NQF, the national leader in healthcare measurement. Each of the data sources was also evaluated across established public health surveillance criteria, including data quality, representativeness, and flexibility, among others. Data analysis was performed using SAS 9.3 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC).
