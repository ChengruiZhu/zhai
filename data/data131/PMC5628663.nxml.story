Ferumoxytol versus Ferric Carboxymaltose for the Treatment of Iron Deficiency Anemia (FIRM) is a randomized, double-blind, international, multicenter, Phase III study designed to compare the safety of ferumoxytol and ferric carboxymaltose (FCM). The study includes adults with hemoglobin <12.0 g/dL (females) or <14.0 g/dL (males), transferrin saturation ≤20% or ferritin ≤100 ng/mL within 60 days of dosing, and a history of unsatisfactory or nontolerated oral iron therapy or in whom oral iron therapy is inappropriate. Patients are randomized (1:1) to ferumoxytol 510 mg or FCM 750 mg, each given intravenously on days 1 and 8. Primary end points are the incidence of moderate-to-severe hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylaxis, and moderate-to-severe hypotension. All potential hypersensitivity and hypotensive reactions will be adjudicated by a blinded, independent Clinical Events Committee. A secondary safety end point is the composite frequency of moderate-to-severe hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylaxis, serious cardiovascular events, and death. Secondary efficacy end points include mean change in hemoglobin and mean change in hemoglobin per milligram of iron administered from baseline to week 5. Urinary excretion of phosphorus and the occurrence of hypophosphatemia after IV iron administration will be examined as well as the mechanisms of such hypophosphatemia in a substudy.
