The role of spreading somatic cell infections with ecotropic MuLV viruses in the induction of plasmacytomas in BALB/cAN pi mice was determined by constructing congenic mice that lacked the gene locus Cv that codes for ecotropic virus. DBA/2 mice that lack Cv on chromosome (chr) 5 carry a closely linked gene Rmcfr that determines resistance to infection with mink cell focus-forming viruses (MCF). Rmcfr was retrogressively back-crossed onto BALB/c for six successive generations to produce N6 mice. N6 mice were mated to each other to produce BALB/c.DBA/2 Rmvfr/Rmcfr homozygotes. This stock of mice lacked Cv, as demonstrated by DNA hybridization and were as fully susceptible to developing plasmacytomas as the parental BALB/c. A second congenic stock BALB/c.DBA/2 Rmcfr/Rmcfr Fv-1n/Fv-1n was also developed, but the mice of this stock showed a reduced incidence of plasmacytomas, as did BALB/c.DBA/2 Fv-1n/Fv-1n mice. These findings indicated Fv-1 or a gene closely linked to it conferred partial resistance to plasmacytomagenesis. In constructing the BALB/c.DBA/2 Fv-1n/Fv-1n stock, a "control" congenic BALB/c.DBA/2 Fv-1b/Fv-1b was also developed at N6. Surprisingly, this stock carried the Qa2+ trait. These mice were also partially resistant to plasmacytomagenesis, suggesting a gene on chromosome 17 (the location of Qa2) or a gene located elsewhere that regulates Qa2 expression is linked to a gene controlling partial resistance to plasmacytoma development.
