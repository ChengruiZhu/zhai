On November 3, 2014, in Bethesda, MD, the Office of Cancer Complementary and Alternative Medicine of the National Cancer Institute held a meeting to examine the potential utility and feasibility of establishing an international consortium for Chinese medicine and cancer. There is significant interest in the West in using components of Chinese medicine (CM) —such as botanicals and herbal medicines, acupuncture and acupressure, and qigong—in the field of oncology, as potential anticancer agents, for symptom management, and to improve quality of life. The proposal for a consortium on CM came from the Chinese Academy of Chinese Medical Sciences, with the aims of improving scientific communications and collaborations and modernizing the studies of CM for cancer. The US National Cancer Institute’s Office of Cancer Complementary and Alternative Medicine agreed to work with Chinese Academy of Chinese Medical Sciences to explore the feasibility of establishing an international consortium for Chinese medicine and cancer. At the meeting, participants from the United States, China, Canada, Australia, and Korea discussed issues in CM and cancer research, treatment, and management, including potential mechanisms of action, proof of efficacy, adverse effects, regulatory issues, and the need for improving the quality of randomized clinical trials of CM treatments and supportive care interventions. Presented in these proceedings are some of the main issues and opportunities discussed by workshop participants.
