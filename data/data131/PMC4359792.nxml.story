(1) The percentage of PN was 4.0% in our study. Patients with MetS (47.7%) had a higher percentage of PN (5.5% vs. 2.6%, respectively, P = 0.001). With the components of MetS increased (non-MetS, three, four, five), a linear increase in the proportion of peripheral neuropathy was observed (2.6%, 4.8%, 5.6% and 7.2%; respectively, P for trend = 0.001). (2) In patients with PN, the average age of patients was significantly older than the corresponding non-PN patients. Waist circumference, fasting blood glucose, HbA1c, proportion of treatment for diabetes and hypertension were significantly higher in PN group compared with non-PN group in MetS patients. (3) The frequency of dysglycemia was the highest in PN patients both with and without MetS (96.2% and 82.1%, P = 0.084). (4) After adjusting for gender and smoking history, the PN was associated with MetS [odds ratio (OR) 2.0; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.2, 3.2; P = 0.006], and age (OR 1.1; 95% CI 1.1, 1.1; P < 0.001). When HOMA-IR was added to this binary logistic regression, the association of PN with MetS disappeared (P = 0.110), but the PN was still associated with HOMA-IR (OR 1.2; 95% CI 1.1, 1.4, P < 0.001).
