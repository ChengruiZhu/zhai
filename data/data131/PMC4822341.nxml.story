Glucocorticoids are the most effective treatment for asthma. However, their clinical applications are limited by low efficacy in severe asthma and by undesired side effects associated with high dose or prolonged use. The most successful approach to overcome these limitations has been the development of highly potent glucocorticoids that can be delivered to the lungs by inhalation to achieve local efficacy with minimal systemic effects. On the basis of our previous structural studies, we designed and developed a highly potent glucocorticoid, VSGC12, which showed an improved anti-inflammation activity in both cell-based reporter assays and cytokine inhibition experiments, as well as in a gene expression profiling of mouse macrophage RAW264.7 cells. In a mouse asthma model, VSGC12 delivered a higher efficacy than fluticasone furoate, a leading clinical compound, in many categories including histology and the number of differentiated immune cells. VSGC12 also showed a higher potency than fluticasone furoate in repressing most asthma symptoms. Finally, VSGC12 showed a better side effect profile than fluticasone furoate at their respective effective doses, including better insulin response and less bone loss in an animal model. The excellent therapeutic and side effect properties of VSGC12 provide a promising perspective for developing this potent glucocorticoid as a new effective drug for asthma.
