The intestinal epithelium is an important model system for studying the dynamics and regulation of multicellular populations. It is characterised by rapid rates of self-renewal and repair; dysregulation of these processes is thought to explain, in part, why many tumours form in the intestinal and similar epithelial tissues. These features have led to a large amount of work on estimating cell kinetic parameters in the intestine. There remain, however, large gaps between the raw data collected, the interpretation of these experimental data, and mechanistic models that describe the underlying processes. Hierarchical statistical modelling provides a natural method with which to bridge these gaps, but has, to date, been underutilised in the study of intestinal tissue self-renewal. As we illustrate, this approach makes essential use of the distinction between ‘measurement’, ‘process’ and ‘parameter’ models, giving an explicit framework for combining experimental data and mechanistic modelling in the presence of multiple sources of uncertainty. We apply this approach to analyse experiments on healthy, damaged and recovering intestinal tissue, finding that observed data can be explained by a model in which cell movement is driven primarily by proliferation.
