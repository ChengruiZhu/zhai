The presence of a pinocytosis receptor, specific for mannose-fucose terminated glycoproteins, has been established on murine resident peritoneal macrophages, thioglycollate-elicited peritoneal macrophages, and macrophages derived from bone-marrow in culture. Macrophagelike cell lines (J-774 and P338.D1), a myelomonocytic cell line (427E), lymphocytes, polymorphonuclear leukocytes, and fibroblasts were negative. Binding and uptake of 125I-mannose-BSA and 125I-beta- glucuronidase, respectively, into thioglycollate-induced peritoneal macrophages is saturable (Kd 4 degrees C = 5.4 X 10(-9) M; Kuptake 37 degrees C = 7 X 10(-7) M) and sugar specific. Macrophage-macrophage (rat X mouse) hybrids prepared by fusing rat alveolar macrophages with J-774-B10 (HAT-sensitive macrophagelike cell line) expresses the mannose-fucose receptor. Karyotypes of the hybrids confirmed a 1:1 fusion of rat and mouse cells. The rat/mouse hybrids express a variety of rat and mouse antigens including Fc receptors. Fibroblast-macrophage hybrids and melanoma-macrophage hybrids were negative for mannose- fucose receptor activity. The expression of the mannose-fucose receptor by macrophages appears to be regulated independently of other macrophage markers.
