The mechanism of luminal solution acidification was studied in Necturus gallbladder by measurement of mucosal solution and intracellular pH with glass electrodes. When the gallbladder was bathed by a Na-Ringer's solution it acidified the luminal side by a Na+-dependent, amiloride- inhibitable process. In the presence of ouabain, acidification was reduced but could be stimulated to a rate greater than that under control conditions by the imposition of an inwardly directed Na+ gradient. These results suggest that luminal acidification results from Na+-H+ exchange at the apical membrane and not by diffusion of metabolic CO2. Li+ can substitute for Na+ but K+, Rb+, Cs+, and tetramethylammonium (TMA+) cannot. The maximal rate of exchange was about five times greater for Na+ than for Li+. Intracellular pH (pHi) was measured with recessed-tip glass microelectrodes; with the tissue bathed in Na-Ringer's solution (pH 7.75), pHi was 7.51 +/- 0.04. After inhibition of Na+-H+ exchange by mucosal perfusion with amiloride (1 mM) or by complete Na+ replacement with TMA+, phi fell reversibly by 0.15 and 0.22 pH units, respectively. These results support the conclusion that Na+-H+ exchange at the apical membrane is the mechanism of luminal acidification and is involved in the maintenance of steady state pHi.
