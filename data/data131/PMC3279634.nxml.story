 = 12 animals) at 0 and 48 h after trauma. After assessment of the fast twitch and tetanic contraction capacity of the muscle at days 4 and 14 post injury, sampling of muscle tissue served for analysis of cell apoptosis (cleaved caspase 3 immunohistochemistry), cell proliferation (BrdU immunohistochemistry) as well as of muscle tissue area and myofiber diameter (HE planimetric analysis). Muscle strength analysis after 14 days in the z-VAD.fmk treated group revealed a significant increase in relative muscle strength when compared to the DMSO treated group. In contrast to the DMSO treated injured muscle, showing a transient switch towards a fast-twitching muscle phenotype (significant increase of the twitch-to-tetanic force ratio), z-VAD.fmk treated animals showed an enhanced healing process with a faster restoration of the twitch-to-tetanic force ratio towards the physiological slow-twitching muscle phenotype. This enhancement of muscle function was accompanied by a significant decrease of cell apoptosis and cell proliferation at day 4 as well as by a significant increase of muscle tissue area at day 4. At day 14 after injury z-VAD.fmk treated animals presented with a significant increase of myofiber diameter compared to the DMSO treated animals. Thus, z-VAD.fmk could provide a promising option in the anti-apoptotic therapy of muscle injury.
