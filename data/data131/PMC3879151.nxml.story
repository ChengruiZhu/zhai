Healthcare associated infections are a major cause of morbidity and mortality. Screening patients on admission to the hospital may reduce prevalence by identifying infected individuals; infected individuals can then be treated or isolated to prevent further spread. Because screening is costly, institutions must weigh the benefits of reduced prevalence against the costs of screening. However, patients move between institutions carrying disease with them; consequently, when choosing who to screen, institutions must also consider the rates at which neighboring institutions screen patients as well. We develop a theoretical model that describes this strategic decision process. Using this model we are able to analyze the screening decision problem along three dimensions: (1) how disease specific parameters, such as the effectiveness of treatment, influence the optimal screening level, (2) how the degree of centralization in screening policy (e.g. local, state or federal) influences the optimal screening level, and (3) how these two sets of factors combine to influence the optimal screening level. Our model highlights factors to consider when choosing to implement screening policy, and results are of use to policy makers wishing to reduce the prevalence of infectious disease.
