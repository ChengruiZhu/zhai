A recent approach to quantitatively characterize the timing and intensity of the inflammatory response relies on the use of four quantities termed inflammation indices. The values of the inflammation indices may reflect the differences between normal and pathological inflammation, and may be used to gauge the effects of therapeutic interventions aimed to control inflammation. Yet, the specific inflammatory mechanisms that can be targeted to selectively control these indices remain unknown. Here, we developed and applied a computational strategy to identify potential target mechanisms to regulate such indices. We used our recently developed model of local inflammation to simulate thousands of inflammatory scenarios. We then subjected the corresponding inflammation index values to sensitivity and correlation analysis. We found that the inflammation indices may be significantly influenced by the macrophage influx and efflux rates, as well as by the degradation rates of three specific molecular mediators. These results suggested that the indices can be effectively regulated by individual or combined inhibition of those molecular mediators, which we confirmed by computational experiments. Taken together, our results highlight possible targets of therapeutic intervention that can be used to control both the timing and the intensity of the inflammatory response.
