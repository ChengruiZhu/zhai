Published data on the association between cyclin D1 (CCND1) G870A polymorphism and gastric cancer (GC) risk are inconclusive. Thus, we conducted a meta-analysis to evaluate the relationship between CCND1 G870A polymorphism and GC risk. We searched PubMed, EMBASE, Web of science and the Cochrane Library up to June 12, 2015 for relevant studies. Odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were used to estimate the strength of associations. Nine studies published from 2003 to 2014, with a total of 1813 cases and 2173 controls, were included in this meta-analysis. The pooled results showed that there was no association between CCND1 G870A polymorphism and GC risk in any genetic model. The subgroup analysis stratified by ethnicity showed an increased breast cancer risk in Caucasian based on heterozygote comparison (GA vs. GG: OR=1.49, 95% CI=1.06-2.10, P=0.02). We found the same association in population based (PB) stratified analyses by Source of controls (AA vs. GG: OR=1.39, 95% CI=1.01-1.93, 0.05). When stratifying by the type, Sex and H. pylori infection in dominant model, Interestingly, we found the opposite result in Male (AA + GA vs. GG: OR=0.5, 95% CI=0.33-0.76, P=0.001), there were no association between CCND1 G870A polymorphism and GC risk in any other subgroup. This meta-analysis suggests that CCND1 G870A polymorphism is a risk factor for susceptibility to GC in Caucasians and in general populations. While, CCND1 G870A polymorphism plays a possible protective effect in GC in Male. Further large scale multicenter epidemiological studies are warranted to confirm this finding.
