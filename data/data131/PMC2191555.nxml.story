V delta 1 bearing T cells comprise the major population of gamma/delta T cells in the human intestinal tract. To gain insight into mechanisms involved in the generation of these cells and the diversity of their repertoire, we have characterized the junctional sequences of V delta 1 T cell receptor transcripts in the human small intestine and colon. Mucosal biopsies obtained from defined regions along the length of the small intestine or colon contained a high frequency of either one or a few identical in frame V delta 1 sequences. Less abundant sequences were also detected repeatedly throughout the length of small intestine or colon. Moreover, the intestinal V delta 1 repertoire in the small intestine and colon appeared compartmentalized and showed no overlap with the V delta 1 repertoire in peripheral blood. Dominant V delta 1 transcripts in each subject differed between the small intestine and colon, and the dominant transcripts within these sites differed among individuals. Analysis of small intestinal transcripts obtained at a 1- yr interval revealed that the V delta 1 repertoire was stable over time. The fact that the majority of V delta 1 transcripts, both dominant and rare, are distributed throughout a several meter length of the adult intestinal tract and are stable over time suggests they are not generated by an ongoing process of in situ VDJ gene rearrangement. Our results favor a model in which the repertoire of V delta 1 T cells in the intestinal tract is shaped by positive selection in response to a limited array of ligands before the migration of V delta 1 cells throughout the small intestine or colon.
