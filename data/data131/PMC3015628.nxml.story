Evaluation and management of abdominal pathology in patients with ventricular assist devices is likely to become increasingly important as the utilization of these devices expands. Ventricular assist devices represent a class of intracorporeal or paracorporeal mechanical devices that augment cardiac output in patients with congestive heart failure. Patients with ventricular assist devices supporting both right and left ventricles (biventricular assist devices) are uniquely challenging to the general surgeon because these devices restrict direct access to the abdominal cavity and because of the perioperative implications of biventricular heart failure. We describe herein the first reported successful laparoscopic cholecystectomy in a patient with a paracorporeal biventricular assist device. Cholecystectomy was performed in this patient for acute cholecystitis that occurred while the patient was awaiting heart transplantation. Our results add weight to the small body of evidence that laparoscopy is well tolerated in ventricular assist devices patients. The unique aspects of the biventricular assist device patient make laparoscopic abdominal intervention particularly suitable in this patient population.
