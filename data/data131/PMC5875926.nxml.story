Compared with never smokers, risk of all-cause mortality was elevated among the 19% of at-diagnosis smokers (HR=1.69, 95% CI=1.36 to 2.11), those who smoked 20 or more cigarettes per day (HR=1.85, 95% CI=1.42 to 2.40), women who had smoked for 30 or more years (HR=1.62, 95% CI=1.28 to 2.05), and women who had smoked 30 or more pack-years (HR=1.82, 95% CI=1.39 to 2.37). Risk of all-cause mortality was further increased among the 8% of women who were at-/post-diagnosis smokers (HR=2.30, 95% CI=1.56 to 3.39) but was attenuated among the 11% women who quit smoking after diagnosis (HR=1.83, 95% CI=1.32 to 2.52). Compared with never smokers, breast cancerâ€“specific mortality risk was elevated 60% (HR=1.60, 95% CI=0.79 to 3.23) among at-/postdiagnosis current smokers, but the confidence interval included the null value and elevated 175% (HR=2.75, 95% CI=1.26 to 5.99) when we considered postdiagnosis cumulative pack-years. Conclusions: Smoking negatively impacts long-term survival after breast cancer. Postdiagnosis cessation of smoking may reduce the risk of all-cause mortality. Breast cancer survivors may benefit from aggressive smoking cessation programs starting as early as the time of diagnosis.
