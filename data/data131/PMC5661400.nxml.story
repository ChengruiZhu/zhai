The homeobox protein homeobox (HOXA9) is a transcriptional factor that regulates patterning during embryogenesis and controls cell differentiation. HOXA9 dysfunction has been implicated in certain cancers. However, the role of HOXA9 in gastric cancer is poorly understood. The present study investigated HOXA9 and its cofactor PBX homeobox 3 (PBX3) expression in patients with gastric cancer. Paired tissue samples from 24 patients and paraffin embedded tissues of gastric cancer patients (104 males and 24 females) were included. HOXA9 and PBX3 expression levels were determined by reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction in fresh tissues, and by immunohistochemical staining in paraffin embedded tissues. The association between HOXA9/PBX3 expression and clinicopathological features was established. The results demonstrated that HOXA9 and PBX3 mRNA levels were significantly upregulated (P=0.032 for HOXA9 and P=0.031 for PBX3) in gastric cancer tissue. Immunohistochemical staining revealed that HOXA9 expression was associated with differentiation, lymph node metastasis and tumor-node-metastasis (TNM) stage, and PBX3 expression was associated with lymph node metastasis and TNM stage. Correlation analysis revealed a high coincidental expression of HOXA9 and PBX3 levels in gastric cancer (r=0.391; P<0.001). Survival analysis showed that high expression of HOXA9 or PBX3 was associated with poor survival of gastric cancer, and multivariate analysis using Cox's regression model showed that PBX3 expression was an independent prognostic factor in gastric cancer. There was elevated expression of HOXA9 and PBX3 in gastric cancer patients, and high-level expression of those proteins was associated with poor prognosis of gastric cancer. The present study underlines the significance of HOXA9/PBX3 in the development of gastric cancer.
