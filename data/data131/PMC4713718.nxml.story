Natural killer cells play an important role as effectors of innate immunity and regulators of adaptive immunity. They are important elements of the innate response to viral infections, which they detect using human leukocyte antigen (HLA) class I-binding receptors. Most polymorphic of these are killer cell immunoglobulin-like receptors (KIRs) which exist as two basic isotypes, activating or inhibitory receptors and are encoded by genes distributed differently in unrelated individuals. We searched for links between selected clinical data (including HCV viremia, liver enzymes level and liver histology parameters) and the presence of genes encoding these receptors and their ligands in hepatitis C virus-infected individuals subjected to pegylated interferon-α and ribavirin therapy. Genomic DNA samples from two hundred and ninety-two chronically infected patients were typed by polymerase chain reaction for the presence or absence of genes for KIRs and their ligands, class I HLA molecules, and clinical data of the patients were collected. Our results suggest an importance of clinical parameters and the contribution of KIR and HLA genes to the course of hepatitis C virus infection and the response to therapy. The study revealed that levels of liver enzymes before therapy were about 30 % higher in patients who possessed a variant
