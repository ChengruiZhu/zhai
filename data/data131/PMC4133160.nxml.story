According to the WHO fact sheet, epilepsy is a neurological disorder affecting about 50 million people worldwide. Even today 30% of epilepsy patients do not respond well to drug therapies. Neocortical focal epilepsy is a particular type of epilepsy in which drug treatments fail and surgical success rate is low. Hence, research is essential to improve the treatment of this type of epilepsy. Recent advances in brain recording methods have led to new observations regarding the nature of neocortical focal epilepsy. However, some of the observations appear to be contradictory. Here, we develop a computational modelling framework that can explain the different observations as different aspects of possible mechanisms that can all lead to seizure onset. Specifically, we classify three main conditions under which focal seizure onset can happen. This classification is clinically important, as our model predicts different treatment strategies for each class. We conclude that focal seizures are diverse, not only in their electrographic appearance and aetiology, but also in their onset mechanism. Combined multiscale recordings as well as stimulation studies are required to elucidate the onset mechanism in each patient. Our work provides the first classification of possible onset mechanism.
