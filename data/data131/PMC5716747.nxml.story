Although immune checkpoints inhibitors have exhibited promising activity in clinical trials in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients, the current programmed cell death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) assays are inconsistent in terms of the staining analysis and scoring system used. To verify the interchangeability of the available PD-L1 assays, we performed immunohistochemistry using three antibody clones used in clinical trials (22C3, SP263, and SP142) and the E1L3N clone as a laboratory developed test for 97 resected NSCLC specimens. Matched tissue microarray specimens were also stained. Staining with 22C3 yielded a greater proportion of stained tumor cells, whereas SP142 staining consistently labelled fewer tumor cells. However, when various cut-off criteria were applied, the positivity rates for PD-L1 were similar, with high concordance, under assay-specific cut-offs. Moreover, seven cases of discordant PD-L1 expression between the resected specimen and matched tissue microarray specimens were observed. In conclusion, despite of inter-assay variability of the PD-L1 status in NSCLC, the positivity rate appears to be similar under assay-specific criteria. Hence, an appropriate clinically defined algorithm or cut-off should be separately applied for each assay. Moreover, multiple biopsy specimens from different tumor areas should be obtained to reduce false results due to intratumoral heterogeneity in PD-L1 expression.
