The aim of the present study was to investigate the role of CTVision in interfractional setup errors during intensity‐modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) in 12 nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) patients. The trend of setup errors as a function of time during a fractionated radiotherapy course was investigated, and the influence of reconstructive thickness on image reconstruction for setup errors was analyzed. The appropriate planning target volume (PTV) margin and planning risk volume (PRV) margin were defined to provide a reference for the design of IMRT for NPC. Based on CTVision, online CT was performed weekly for each patient. Setup errors were measured by registration between the CT reconstructed image and reference image. Mean of setup errors, estimated population systematic (:), and population random (σ) errors were calculated using SPSS (v15.0). Optimum PTV and PRV margins were calculated. In the clinical data, for the LR (left–right), SI (superior–inferior), and AP (anterior–posterior) directions, : was 0.8, 0.8, and 1.0 mm, respectively, and σ was 1.0, 1.3, and 0.8 mm, respectively. In the LR, SI, and AP directions, PTV margins were at least 2.7, 2.9, and 3.0 mm, respectively, and PRV margins were at least 1.5, 1.7, and 1.7 mm, respectively. No significant differences in setup errors were observed during the fractionated radiotherapy course
