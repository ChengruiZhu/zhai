This paper examines the state of the art in mobile clinical and health-related apps. A 2012
estimate puts the number of health-related apps at no fewer than 40,000, as healthcare professionals
and consumers continue to express concerns about the quality of many apps, calling for some form of
app regulatory control or certification to be put in place. We describe the range of apps on offer
as of 2013, and then present a brief survey of evaluation studies of medical and health-related apps
that have been conducted to date, covering a range of clinical disciplines and topics. Our survey
includes studies that highlighted risks, negative issues and worrying deficiencies in existing apps.
We discuss the concept of ‘apps as a medical device’ and the relevant regulatory
controls that apply in USA and Europe, offering examples of apps that have been formally approved
using these mechanisms. We describe the online Health Apps Library run by the National Health
Service in England and the calls for a vetted medical and health app store. We discuss the
ingredients for successful apps beyond the rather narrow definition of ‘apps as a medical
device’. These ingredients cover app content quality, usability, the need to match apps to
consumers’ general and health literacy levels, device connectivity standards (for apps that
connect to glucometers, blood pressure monitors, etc.), as well as app security and user privacy.
‘Happtique Health App Certification Program’ (HACP), a voluntary app certification
scheme, successfully captures most of these desiderata, but is solely focused on apps targeting the
US market. HACP, while very welcome, is in ways reminiscent of the early days of the Web, when many
“similar” quality benchmarking tools and codes of conduct for information publishers
were proposed to appraise and rate online medical and health information. It is probably impossible
to rate and police every app on offer today, much like in those early days of the Web, when people
quickly realised the same regarding informational Web pages. The best first line of defence was, is,
and will always be to educate consumers regarding the potentially harmful content of (some)
apps.
