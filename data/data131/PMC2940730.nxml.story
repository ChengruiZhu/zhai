The heat shock protein 70 (Hsp70) serves as a housekeeper in the cell, assisting in the correct folding, trafficking, and degradation of many proteins. The ATPase domain is the control unit of this molecular machine and its efficient functioning requires interactions with co-chaperones, including, in particular, the nucleotide exchange factors (NEFs). We examined the molecular motions of the ATPase domain in both NEF-bound and -unbound forms. We found that the NEF-binding surface enjoys large global movements prior to NEF binding, which presumably facilitates NEF recognition and binding. NEF binding stabilizes the ATPase domain in an open form and thereby facilitates the nucleotide exchange step of the chaperone cycle. A series of highly correlated amino acids were distinguished at the NEF-binding sites of the Hsp70 ATPase domain, which highlights the adaptability of the ATPase domain, both structurally and sequentially, to recognize NEFs. In contrast, the nucleotide-binding residues are tightly held near a global hinge center and are highly conserved. The contrasting properties of these two groups of residues point to an evolutionarily optimized balance between conserved/constrained and co-evolved/mobile amino acids, which enables the functional interactions of the modular Hps70 ATPase domains with NEFs.
