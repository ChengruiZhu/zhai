In osteoarthritis (OA), activated synoviocytes and articular chondrocytes produce pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as IL-1β, that promote chondrocyte apoptosis and activate the NF-κB signaling pathway to induce catabolic factors. In this study, we examined the anti-inflammatory and anti-apoptotic effect of baicalein on IL-1β signaling and NF-κB-regulated gene products in rat chondrocytes. Rat chondrocytes were pretreated with 10 ng/ml IL-1β for 24 h and then co-treated with 10 ng/ml IL-1β and 50 μM baicalein for 0, 12, 24, 36 and 48h. The expression levels of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP), Bcl-2, caspase-3, matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-9, MMP-3, cyclooxygenase (COX)-2 and SOX-9 were detected by Western blot and quantitative reverse transcription-PCR (qPCR). The effects of baicalein on the translocation and phosphorylation of the NF-κB system were studied by Western blotting and immunofluorescence. Baicalein stimulated the expression of anti-apoptotic genes and reduced the pro-apoptotic and pro-inflammatory gene products in chondrocytes. Baicalein promoted SOX-9 expression in a time-dependent manner in chondrocytes. Baicalein inhibited the NF-κB activation that was induced by IL-1β in a time-dependent manner in chondrocytes. Our results suggest that the anti-inflammatory and anti-apoptotic effects of baicalein are mediated through the inhibition of the translocation of phosphorylated p65 to the nucleus.
