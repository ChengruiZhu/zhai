The cohort included 2686 patients (median age 42.9 years, 72% male, 56% black). A three-class model best fit the data: “Adherent” “Non-adherent” and “Sick”. “Adherent” patients had high rates of clinic attendance in each half of the year (84%), rarely visited the ED (3.6% with ≥1 ED visit per year), and moderate rates of (54%) viral suppression. “Non-adherent” patients rarely attended clinic visits in both halves of the year (1.5%), used the ED more than “adherent” patients (10.3% with ≥1 ED visit per year), and had low rates of viral suppression (19%). “Sick” patients also had high rates of clinic attendance (75%), were frequent users of the ED (53% with ≥1 ED visit per year), and comparable rates of viral suppression to the “adherent” group (55%) viral suppression. Non-white race (OR 1.9) and age ≤ 40 (OR 3.76) were associated with membership in the “non-adherent” class. Movement between classes was dynamic, especially in the “sick” group (30–40% of whom moved to a different class the following year). Across all years, persons in the “non-adherent” class were more likely to completely disengage from care the following year than “adherent” persons (23.6% v. 0.2%, P <0.001).
