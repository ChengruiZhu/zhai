Imagine that ahead of you is a long time of work: when will you take a break? This sort of issue – how to allocate effort over time – has been addressed by distinct theoretical fields, with different emphasis on reactive and predictive processes. An intuitive view is that you start working, stop when you are tired, and start again when fatigue goes away. Biologically, this means that decisions are taken when some physiological variable reaches a given bound on the risk of homeostatic failure. In a more economic perspective, fatigue translates into effort cost, which must be anticipated and compared to expected benefit before engaging an action. We proposed a computational model that bridges these perspectives from sport physiology and decision theory. Decisions are made in reaction to bounds being reached by an implicit cost variable that accumulates during effort, at a rate proportional to task difficulty, and dissipates during rest. However, some latent parameters (bounds and dissipation rate) are adjusted in anticipation, depending on explicit costs and benefits. This model was supported by behavioral data obtained using a paradigm where participants squeeze a handgrip to win a monetary payoff proportional to effort duration.
