Cyclooxygenase (COX)-2 is upregulated in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). However, the direct causative effect of COX-2 in spontaneous HCC formation remains unknown. We thus investigate the role and molecular pathogenesis of COX-2 in HCC by using liver-specific COX-2 transgenic (TG) mice. We found spontaneous HCC formation with elevated inflammatory infiltrates and neovessels in male TG mice (3/21, 14.3%), but not in any of male WT mice (0/19). Reduced representation bisulfite sequencing (RRBS) and gene expression microarrays were performed in the HCC tumor and non-HCC liver tissues to investigate the molecular mechanisms of COX-2-driven HCC. By RRBS, DNA promoter hypermethylation was identified in HCC from TG mice. Induction of promoter hypermethylation was associated with reduced tet methylcytosine dioxygenase 1 (TET1) expression by COX-2. TET1 could catalyze the conversion of 5-methylcytosine into 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC) and prevents DNA hypermethylation. In keeping with this, loss of 5hmC was demonstrated in COX-2-induced HCC. Consistently, COX-2 overexpression in human HCC cell lines could reduce both TET1 expression and 5hmc levels. Integrative analyses of DNA methylation and gene expression profiles further identified significantly downregulated genes including
