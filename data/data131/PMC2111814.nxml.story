The postsynaptic density (PSD) fraction from canine cerebra cortex was found to contain an endogenous cyclic nucleotide-phosphodiesterase activity that was independent on Mn2+ and/or Mg2+ but not on Ca2+. Maximal activity was obtained at 1 micrometer Mn2+. This cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterase activity was not decreased upon removal of the calmodulin from the PSD fraction, nor was it increased by the addition of calmodulin to a postsynaptic density fraction deficient in calmodulin. The enzymatic activity could be extracted by sonication, with the soluble enzyme having properties similar to those found in the native structure. Two peaks of cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterase activities could be obtained after S-300 Sephacryl column chromatography of this soluble fraction: fraction I (excluded peak) and fraction II (215,000 mol wt). The fraction I activity preferred cyclic AMP over cyclic GMP and was not activated by calmodulin. The fraction II activity has an approximately fourfold lower Km for cyclic GMP over cyclic AMP. This fraction II activity was activatable by calmodulin, which increased the Vmax and decreased the Km in the case of both cyclic nucleotides. We conclude that two activities are present in the PSD, one activatable, and one not activatable, by calmodulin.
