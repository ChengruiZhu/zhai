Minimally invasive follicular thyroid carcinoma (MI-FTC) is characterized by limited capsular and/or vascular invasion with good long-term outcomes. However, some cases of MI-FTC show a poor prognosis because of severe distant metastasis (i.e., metastatic MI-FTC). Nonetheless, no method has been established for predicting the prognosis of MI-FTC. This study was conducted to identify novel prognostic factors for metastatic MI-FTC by the use of microRNA (miRNA). Thirty-four patients with MI-FTC were categorized into two groups: the metastatic group, M(+) (n=12) and the non-metastatic group, M(−) (n=22). In the M(+) group, distant metastasis was recognized after the initial operation established the diagnosis of MI-FTC. In the M(−) group, no distant metastasis was recognized postoperatively for ≥10 years. Using laser micro-dissection followed by quantitative real-time PCR and PCR arrays, we performed a comprehensive expression profiling of 667 miRNAs in formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded samples from the initial MI-FTC operation. Furthermore, we assessed the potential use of miRNAs as novel biomarkers for the metastatic potential of MI-FTC by logistic regression analysis. Comprehensive quantitative analysis of miRNA expression in MI-FTC samples revealed that the
