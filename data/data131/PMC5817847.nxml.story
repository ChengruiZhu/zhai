This study reports an analytical method for the determination of nitroimidazole and quinolones in honey using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). A modified QuEChERS methodology was used to extract the analytes and determine veterinary drugs in honey by LC-MS/MS. The linear regression was excellent at the concentration levels of 1–100 ng/mL in the solution standard curve and the matrix standard curve. The recovery rates of nitroimidazole and quinolones were 4.4% to 59.1% and 9.8% to 46.2% with relative standard deviations (RSDs) below 5.2% and the recovery rates of nitroimidazole and quinolones by the matrix standard curve ranged from 82.0% to 117.8% and 79% to 115.9% with relative standard deviations (RSDs) lower than 6.3% in acacia and jujube honey. The acacia and jujube honeys have stronger matrix inhibition effect to nitroimidazole and quinolones residue; the matrix inhibition effect of jujube honey is stronger than acacia honey. The matrix standard curve can calibrate matrix effect effectively. In this study, the detection method of antibiotics in honey can be applied to the actual sample. The results demonstrated that the modified QuEChERS method combined with LC-MS/MS is a rapid, high, sensitive method for the analysis of nitroimidazoles and quinolones residues in honey.
