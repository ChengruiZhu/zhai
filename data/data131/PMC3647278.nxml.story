We searched the MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Cochrane Central Register databases for relevant studies in English between January 1, 1980, and January 1, 2012. Extraction was by 3 independent reviewers. Summary incidence, risk ratios (RRs), and confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated using fixed‐effects and random‐effects modeling. Meta‐regression was also performed to identify sources of between‐study variation. Nine studies were included, representing a total of 201 239 patients with mild and 17 415 patients with severe psoriasis. The level of covariate adjustment varied among studies, leading to the possibility of residual confounding. Using the available adjusted effect sizes, mild psoriasis remained associated with a significantly increased risk of myocardial infarction (RR, 1.29; 95% CI, 1.02 to 1.63) and stroke (RR, 1.12; 95% CI, 1.08 to 1.16). Severe psoriasis was associated with a significantly increased risk of cardiovascular mortality (RR, 1.39; 95% CI, 1.11 to 1.74), myocardial infarction (RR, 1.70; 95% CI, 1.32 to 2.18), and stroke (RR, 1.56 95% CI, 1.32 to 1.84). Based on these risk ratios and the background population event rates, psoriasis is associated with an estimated excess of 11 500 (95% CI, 1169 to 24 407) major adverse cardiovascular events each year.
