 1. Quartz particles and certain other particles move cataphoretically in certain soft gelatin gels, with the same velocity as in the sol. The speed is a function of the true viscosity of the sol or gel, and it is See PDF for Structure apparently not altered in these soft gels by the presence of gel structure. It is proportional to the applied difference of potential. 2. This finding is compatible with the fact that certain sols undergo gelation with no increase of the true viscosity although a marked change in the apparent viscosity takes place. 3. Red cells in soft gelatin-serum gels show a distinct difference in behavior. They migrate through the sol or gel with a speed that is about twice as great as the leucocytes and quartz particles, which latter particles migrate with the same velocity. This ratio has been found to hold for serum and plasma. The absolute velocities are comparatively slightly decreased by the presence of the gel. 4. In more concentrated or stiffer gels, leucocytes, red cells and quartz particles all move at first with the same velocity. By producing mechanical softening of these gels (shearing from cataphoretic movement of the micells within the cell) the red cells presently resume their previous property of independent migration through the gel. 5. The movements of particles in gelatin gels produced by a magnetic force or the force of gravity are of a different nature than those movements produced by cataphoresis. 6. The mechanical nature of obstruction to the cataphoretic migration of leucocytes and red cells in fibrin gels is briefly described. 7. The correlation of cataphoresis of microscopic particles in gels with the order of magnitude and nature of the potential differences in the capillary wall, lends additional evidence to the theory that polymorphonuclear leucocyte emigration and migration are dependent upon these potential differences.
