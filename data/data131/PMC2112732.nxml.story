Lamellipodia have been induced to form within the reticulopodial networks of Allogromia laticollaris by being plated on positively charged substrata. Video-enhanced, polarized light, and differential interference contrast microscopy have demonstrated the presence of positively birefringent fibrils within these lamellipodia. The fibrils correspond to the microtubules and bundles of microtubules observed in whole-mount transmission electron micrographs of lamellipodia. Microtubular fibrils exhibit two types of movements within the lamellipodia: lateral and axial translocations. Lateral movements are often accompanied by reversible lateral associations between adjacent fibrils within a lamellipodium. This lateral association-dissociation of adjacent fibrils has been termed 'zipping' and 'unzipping'. Axial translocations are bidirectional. The axial movements of the microtubular fibrils can result in the extension of filopodia by pushing against the plasma membrane of the lamellipodia. Shortening, or complete withdrawal, of such filopodia is accomplished by the reversal of the direction of the axial movement. The bidirectional streaming characteristic of the reticulopodial networks also occurs within the lamellipodia. In these flattened regions the streaming is clearly seen to occur exclusively in association with the intracellular fibrils. Transport of both organelles and bulk hyaline cytoplasm occurs bidirectionally along the fibrils.
