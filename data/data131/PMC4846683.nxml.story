This review of tuberculosis epidemiology is intended to provide a historical perspective on the public health approach to tuberculosis (TB) control in California. This historical context offers a lens through which to view current epidemiologic trends and insight into how new therapeutic tools can be applied. Since 1993, the year detailed case reporting was instituted, California has had a decrease in recent TB transmission as evidenced by a reduction in pediatric cases and an increased percentage of cases attributable to progression of latent infection to TB disease in the foreign-born population. Overall, there has been a dramatic decline in the annual TB case count, but the speed of the decline has slowed over the last several years. At the current pace and case count of 2137 in 2015, California will not achieve TB elimination (<1 TB case per one million population) for at least 100 years. There are an estimated 2.1 million persons in California with latent TB infection. Modeling suggests that LTBI detection and treatment are important in reaching TB elimination. For this reason, a coalition of stakeholders in California is exploring novel approaches to accelerate the case decline in order to prevent unnecessary disease and death.
