Leukocyte telomere length becomes shorter with age and is apparently a biomarker of aging and a forecaster of longevity in humans. Leukocyte telomere length is heritable, longer in women than in men, and is relatively shorter in persons who suffer from aging-related diseases, cardiovascular diseases in particular. This study found in four different populations that leukocyte telomere length in adult offspring was positively correlated with paternal age at the time of birth of the offspring. Analysis of telomeres in sperm of young (<30 years) and older (>50 years) donors revealed the emergence in the older donors of a subset of sperm with elongated telomeres. The mechanisms behind this enigmatic, age-dependent elongation in telomere length of sperm are unknown but may relate to epigenetic factors or the survival of a subset of germ-line stem cells, resilient against aging. It is also unknown how older fathers endow their offspring with longer telomeres in their leukocytes. The potential impact of paternal age on leukocyte telomere length and, conceivably, aging-related diseases and longevity in the offspring is of relevance because offspring of older fathers comprise an increasing proportion of society.
