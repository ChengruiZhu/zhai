Particulate matter (PM) has been found to damage vital body organs, including the lungs and heart, through vascular damage and oxidative stress. Recently, renal function and chronic urologic diseases have also been found to be related to PM. To investigate this, we reviewed the characteristics of PM related to renal toxicity, including recent studies on the associations of urologic diseases with PM. PM can include constituents that cause renal toxicity, such as lead, cadmium, arsenic, and crystalline silica, which result in renal tubular or interstitial damage. Since 2008, 7 studies have evaluated the renal effects of PM. Two prospective cohort studies and a quantitative study of consecutive patients showed that PM may be related to decreased renal function, as shown by the estimated glomerular filtration rate of diseased or aged participants. Two cross-sectional studies found an association between PM and chronic kidney disease. One of those studies identified the specific renal diseases of immunoglobulin A nephropathy and membranous nephropathy. Two studies that analyzed renal cancer and PM showed no evidence that renal cancer is related to PM. Nine studies were evaluated regarding the relationship of bladder and prostate cancer with PM. The evidence for an association of PM with bladder and prostate cancer is still inconclusive. Although some recently published studies have shown a significant relationship, the causal relationship is not clear. Further well-designed studies on specific renal diseases are required.
