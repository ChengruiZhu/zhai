During development, tissues are shaped in order to form organs with specific functionalities. This process relies on mechanisms that control cell segregation and migration. These concepts are beautifully illustrated by the morphogenetic events that the imaginal discs of Drosophila undergo during metamorphosis. In particular, the cellular populations that will give rise to the dorsal (D) and ventral (V) parts on the wing blade are segregated and do not intermingle. The so-called organizer, a cellular population that becomes specified by the boundary of the D and V cellular domains, is responsible for this. Yet, how does the DV organizer robustly deal with the cellular growth in order to prevent cell mixing? Moreover, how can the organizer be conveniently scaled as the tissue grows? Herein we address these questions using a computational approach that takes into account the available experimental data. Thus, our study unveils the elements that are necessary and sufficient for understanding in a quantitative and predictive manner the dynamics, structure, and stability of a robust growing DV organizer: distinctive mechanical properties of cells, differences in cell cycle duration, and a well-defined cleavage criterion.
