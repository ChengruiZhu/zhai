The ‘cocktail party’ effect is a phenomenon by which one is able to pick out and listen to a single person’s speech in a noisy room. In information engineering, this is termed blind source separation. Numerous computational studies demonstrate that simulated neural networks can perform blind source separation. However, if or how a living neural network learns to perform blind source separation remains unknown. Using a microelectrode array (MEA) system that allowed us to apply composite inputs and record responses from neurons throughout a cultured neural network, we discovered that even neurons in cultures of dissociated rat cortical cells can separate individual sources from a complex mixture of inputs in the absence of teacher signals. Given these findings, we then determined that the neural networks adapted to reduce free energy, as predicted by the free energy principle and Jaynes’ principle of maximum entropy. These results provide evidence that cultured neural networks can perform blind source separation and that they are governed by the free-energy principle, providing a compelling framework for understanding how the brain identifies and processes signals hidden in complex multivariate information.
