Differential equation models of signaling processes are useful to gain a molecular and quantitative understanding of cellular information flow. Although these models are typically based on simple kinetic rules, they can often qualitatively describe the behavior of biological systems. However, in the quest to transform biomedical research into an engineering discipline, biologists face the challenge of estimating important parameters of such models from laboratory data. Measurement noise as well as the robust architecture of biological circuits are causes for large uncertainty of parameter estimates. This makes it difficult to plan informative experiments. Here, we used a computational method to predict and minimize the uncertainty of parameter estimates we would obtain from prospective experiments given a cancer-relevant signaling model. This was achieved by optimizing the concentrations and time points for adding drugs in a live-cell microscopy experiment. Our experimental results demonstrated that the advice given by this algorithm resulted in many-fold more informative data than we would obtain by repeating an intuitively planned experiment. Our study shows that significant experimental effort and time can be saved by adopting an optimal experimental design strategy for inferring relevant parameters from biomedical experiments.
