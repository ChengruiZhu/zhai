Epidemiological studies have shown that dietary compounds have significant effects on prostate carcinogenesis. Among dietary agents, genistein, the major isoflavone in soybean, is of particular interest because high consumption of soy products has been associated with a low incidence of prostate cancer, suggesting a preventive role of genistein in prostate cancer. In spite of numerous studies to understand the effects of genistein on prostate cancer, the mechanisms of action have not been fully elucidated. We investigated the differences in methylation and gene expression levels of prostate specimens from a clinical trial of genistein supplementation prior to prostatectomy using Illumina HumanMethylation450 and Illumina HumanHT-12 v4 Expression BeadChip Microarrays. The present study was a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind clinical trial on Norwegian patients who received 30 mg genistein or placebo capsules daily for 3â€“6 weeks before prostatectomy. Gene expression changes were validated by quantitative PCR (qPCR). Whole genome methylation and expression profiling identified differentially methylated sites and expressed genes between placebo and genistein groups. Differentially regulated genes were involved in developmental processes, stem cell markers, proliferation and transcriptional regulation. Enrichment analysis suggested overall reduction in MYC activity and increased PTEN activity in genistein-treated patients. These findings highlight the effects of genistein on global changes in gene expression in prostate cancer and its effects on molecular pathways involved in prostate tumorigenesis.
