Enzymes are biological molecules essential for catalyzing the chemical reactions in living systems, allowing organisms to convert nutrients into usable forms and convert harmful or unneeded molecules into forms that can be reused or excreted. During enzyme evolution, enzymes maintain the ability to perform some aspects of their function while other aspects change to accommodate changing environmental conditions. In analogy to studies of enzyme evolution focused on conservation of sequence and structural motifs, we have examined a large number of enzyme superfamilies using a new computational analysis of patterns of substrate conservation. The results provide a more nuanced picture of enzyme evolution than obtained either by detailed small-scale studies or by large-scale studies that have provided only general descriptions of function and substrate similarity. The superfamilies in our set fall along the entire spectrum from the conserved substructure being mostly reacting to mostly nonreacting, with most superfamilies falling in the intermediate range. This view of enzyme evolution suggests more complex patterns of functional divergence than those that have been proposed by previous theories of enzyme evolution. The method has been automated to facilitate large-scale annotation of enzymes discovered in sequencing and structural genomics projects.
