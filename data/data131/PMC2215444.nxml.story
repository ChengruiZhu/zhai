Sodium movement across the luminal membrane of the toad bladder is the rate-limiting step for active transepithelial transport. Recent studies suggest that changes in intracellular sodium regulate the Na permeability of the luminal border, either directly or indirectly via increases in cell calcium induced by the high intracellular sodium. To test these proposals, we measured Na movement across the luminal membrane (th Na influx) and found that it is reduced when intracellular Na is increased by ouabain or by removal of external potassium. Removal of serosal sodium also reduced the influx, suggesting that the Na gradient across the serosal border rather than the cell Na concentration is the critical factor. Because in tissues such as muscle and nerve a steep transmembrane sodium gradient is necessary to maintain low cytosolic calcium, it is possible that a reduction in the sodium gradient in the toad bladder reduces luminal permeability by increasing the cell calcium activity. We found that the inhibition of the influx by ouabain or low serosal Na was prevented, in part, by removal of serosal calcium. To test for the existence of a sodium- calcium exchanger, we studied calcium transport in isolated basolateral membrane vesicles and found that calcium uptake was proportional to the outward directed sodium gradient. Uptake was not the result of a sodium diffusion potential. Calcium efflux from preloaded vesicles was accelerated by an inward directed sodium gradient. Preliminary kinetic analysis showed that the sodium gradient changes the Vmax but not the Km of calcium transport. These results suggest that the effect of intracellular sodium on the luminal sodium permeability is due to changes in intracellular calcium.
