(3) A total of 57.2% (1360/2379) of patients with gallbladder carcinoma also had gallstones. (4) Abdominal pain (1796/2379, 75.5%) and jaundice (727/2379, 30.6%) were the most common clinical manifestations, 81.2% (1527/1881) were positive in those receiving B ultrasound examinations and 90.7% (1567/1727) were positive in those undergoing computed tomography, and 64.5% (1124/1742) of patients with gallbladder carcinoma were positive for carbohydrate antigen (CA) 19-9. (5) The pathological type of gallbladder carcinoma was mainly moderately and poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma with a high degree of malignancy. At admission, 55.1% (1091/1981) of patients had stage IV cancer among patients with TNM staging information; 55.9% (1331/2379) had lymphatic metastasis, 29.7% (706/2379) had bile duct metastasis, and 53.1% (1263/2379) had liver metastasis. (6) A total of 283 patients (283/2379, 11.9%) had incidentally detected gallbladder carcinoma. (7) The rate of radical surgical resection was 30.4% (723/2379).
