M) were added separately or in combination for 48â€‰h. Intracellular triglyceride (TG) accumulation was visualized and quantified colorimetrically. Protein markers of autophagic flux (LC3 and p62) and cell death (caspase-3 cleavage) were measured by immunoblotting. Inhibition of autophagy by bafilomycin increased TG accumulation and also increased lipid-mediated cell death. Conversely, activation of autophagy by rapamycin reduced both intracellular lipid accumulation and cell death. Unexpectedly, treatment with both drugs added simultaneously resulted in decreased lipid accumulation. In this treatment group, immunoblotting revealed p62 degradation (autophagic flux), immunofluorescence revealed the colocalization of p62 with lipid droplets, and co-immunoprecipitation confirmed the interaction of p62 with ADRP (adipose differentiation-related protein), a lipid droplet membrane protein. Thus the association of p62 with lipid droplet turnover suggests a novel pathway for the breakdown of lipid droplets in muscle cells. In addition, treatment with rapamycin and bafilomycin together also suggested the export of TG into the extracellular space. We conclude that lipophagy promotes the clearance of lipids from myocytes and switches to an alternative, p62-mediated, lysosomal-independent pathway in the context of chronic lipid overload (*
