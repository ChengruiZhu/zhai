Adenocarcinoma of the esophagus is increasing in frequency and is the 6th most common cause of cancer death in North America. In adenocarcinoma cell lines, we have previously demonstrated that expression of miR-145, leads to enhanced invasion, resistance to anoikis and better attachment to fibronectin in esophageal adenocarcinoma. In contrast, expression of miR-145 acts as a tumor suppressor in squamous cell carcinoma. The molecular mechanisms responsible for the oncogenic effects of miR-145 were investigated. In this report, we demonstrate that we can partially recreate the miR-145 effects in EAC by knock down of the expression of c-Myc, which is one of the targets of miR-145. Knocking down of c-Myc expression resulted in upregulation of integrin subunits α5 and β3. Finally, we demonstrated that integrin α5 expression correlates to fibronectin attachment potential whereas integrin β3 expression correlates with resistance to anoikis and invasion potential. Finally, we demonstrate that expression of miR-145 in esophageal adenocarcinoma cell line (SK-GT-4) enhances tumor growth and metastasis in a NOD/SCID xenograft model. Overall, the oncogenic potential of miR-145 in EAC appears to be mediated by downregulation of c-Myc leading to the expression of integrins subunits α5 and β3.
