The infection of a cell by HIV proceeds through a series of stages and each stage can now be inhibited by an available antiretroviral drug class. It is known that different drug classes can result in different decay curves of plasma viral levels that are not well explained by current mathematical models of HIV dynamics. Here we develop a mathematical model that incorporates these stages of infection and show how it successfully reproduces plasma decay curves for the five classes of currently available antiretroviral drugs. Our modeling indicates that the efficacy of antiretroviral drugs is not solely described by the rate of decay of plasma viral levels as currently thought. Drugs such as the integrase inhibitor raltegravir will result in a faster initial decline of plasma viral levels compared to a drug that acts further from viral integration and production such as the CCR5 inhibitor maraviroc, even though they may have the same efficacy. Moreover, we find that infected cells only die at rates above the background level when they are in the productive phase, indicating that immune clearance is mostly absent from the early stages of HIV cellular infection. This is of particular concern given that most infected cells are in these early stages of infection.
