A major contributing factor associated with increased cardiac mortality in patients with schizophrenia (SCZ) seems to be a dysfunction of the autonomic nervous system (ANS). The link between ANS dysfunction and SCZ is multifactorial, but some reports suggest that the use of antipsychotics could be implicated. This case illustrates the time course of autonomic improvement in response to antipsychotic treatment in an inpatient with SCZ in acute psychosis. To this end, we documented markers of autonomic function during hospitalization. Heart rate variability (HRV; cardiac autonomic modulation) analysis showed an increased variability over time (from Day 1 to Day 3), with strongest reaction at Day 3. The respiration analysis showed an increased respiratory variability over time (from Day 1 to Day 3) suggesting improved autonomic modulation in response to the pharmacotherapy. Cardiorespiratory coupling (CRC; surrogate of cardiorespiratory synchrony and cardiovagal modulation) showed an increasing influence of heart rate on respiration and increased from Day 1 to Day 3. The concurrent improvement of psychosis and autonomic function in response to antipsychotic treatment in this patient suggest a potential cardio protective role of antipsychotics in the acute setting. Prospective trials aimed at examining the cardiovascular implications of acute psychosis treatment in patients with schizophrenia are warranted.
