The organization of cooperating enzymes into complexes is a pervasive feature of metabolism. In particular, this phenomenon has been shown to participate in the regulation of flux through the networks of both primary and secondary metabolism in plants. It remains a challenging task to unravel the organizing principles of such “metabolic channels,” which can be temporary or persistent, and to understand their biological function. In this article, we analyze metabolic channels in the biosynthetic pathway of lignin, a complex polymer that stiffens and fortifies secondary cell walls within woody tissues. This system is well suited because the present analysis can be based on a computational, experimentally validated model demonstrating that several enzymes are spatially associated into channels specific for the production of two lignin monomers. To characterize the functioning of these channels, we develop a novel computational approach that is capable of identifying interesting structural and regulatory features of metabolic channeling and permits the formulation of targeted and readily testable hypotheses. Since the spontaneous or controlled assembly of molecules into functional units is known to occur in many biological contexts where information flow is tightly coordinated, the proposed approach might have broad applications in the field of computational systems biology.
