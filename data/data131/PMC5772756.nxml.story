Dysregulation of microRNAs in various types of human cancer promote or suppress oncogenesis. MicroRNA (miR)-1 was previously revealed to function as a tumor suppressor in prostate cancer cells, and its expression was associated with reduced metastatic potential in lung cancer. The present study investigated the role of miR-1 and its association with phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate 3-kinase catalytic subunit Î± (PIK3CA) in the pathophysiology of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC), and analyzed the effects of miR-1 inhibitor or mimics on sensitivity to epidermal growth factor receptor-tyrosine kinase inhibitors, the alterations of cell cycle distribution and apoptosis in ESCC cells. Compared with normal tissues, the level of miR-1 expression was significantly lower and PIK3CA expression was higher in ESCC tissues. The level of miR-1 expression was also inversely associated with the level of PIK3CA mRNA expression. Low miR-1 and high PIK3CA expression levels were strongly associated with lymph node metastasis, and the level of miR-1 expression was negatively associated with clinical Tumor-Node-Metastasis stage. Furthermore, exogenous expression of miR-1 inhibited growth, arrested cell cycle in the G
