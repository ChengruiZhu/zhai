The MRI on further review showed that one of the lesions was a periventricular enhancing area and the largest lesion was an open ring with T2 and DWI enhancement. The fine needle aspiration (FNA) samples of the thyroid both showed benign histology. The laboratory evaluation was negative except for a mildly elevated CRP with no tumor markers identified and the spinal tap was positive for elevated protein and particularly oligoclonal bands. The PET scan showed no sites of fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) avid masses including the thyroid. Multiple sclerosis (MS) represents 400,000 cases in the US and benign thyroid nodules noted on imaging range from 19-35% of the population. One pathognomonic finding of MS that is less common is the open rings called tumefactive lesions versus the closed rings seen with metastases.Â A cystic thyroid lesion can range from a benign process to a differentiated thyroid cancer. The rate of distant metastasis with these cancers ranges from 1-23% in the literature. Lung and bone metastasis are the most common sites with CNS metastasis only accounting for < 2% of the cases. A better understanding of these findings should allow physicians to have a higher degree of suspicion in these cases and provoke further inquiry to prevent unnecessary injury.
