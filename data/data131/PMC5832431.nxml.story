Recent progress in the understanding of neurodegenerative diseases revealed that multiple molecular mechanisms contribute to pathological changes in neurons. A large fraction of these alterations can be linked to dysfunction in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and mitochondria, affecting metabolism and secretion of lipids and proteins, calcium homeostasis, and energy production. Remarkably, these organelles are interacting with each other at specialized domains on the ER called mitochondria-associated membranes (MAMs). These membrane structures rely on the interaction of several complexes of proteins localized either at the mitochondria or at the ER interface and serve as an exchange platform of calcium, metabolites, and lipids, which are critical for the function of both organelles. In addition, recent evidence indicates that MAMs also play a role in the control of mitochondria dynamics and autophagy. MAMs thus start to emerge as a key element connecting many changes observed in neurodegenerative diseases. This review will focus on the role of MAMs in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and hereditary motor and sensory neuropathy, two neurodegenerative diseases particularly affecting neurons with long projecting axons. We will discuss how defects in MAM signaling may impair neuronal calcium homeostasis, mitochondrial dynamics, ER function, and autophagy, leading eventually to axonal degeneration. The possible impact of MAM dysfunction in glial cells, which may affect the capacity to support neurons and/or axons, will also be described. Finally, the possible role of MAMs as an interesting target for development of therapeutic interventions aiming at delaying or preventing neurodegeneration will be highlighted.
