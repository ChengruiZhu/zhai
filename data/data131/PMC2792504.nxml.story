A sensitive, simple, specific, precise, accurate and rugged method for determination of enantiomeric purity of S-(-)-1-cyclopropyl-6-fluoro-1,4-dihydro-8-methoxy-7-{4-amino-3,3-dimethylpiperidin-1-yl}-4-oxo-quinoline-3-carboxylic acid hydrochloride monohydrate, WCK 1152, a new drug substance has been developed. The method is based on prederivatization of analyte to diastereomer followed by RP-HPLC using endcapped C-18 stationary phase. Column was maintained at 30Â°C. The UV/Vis detector was operated at 290 nm. Flow rate of the mobile phase was 1.25 ml/min. The method offers excellent separation of two enantiomers with resolution more than 4 and tailing factor less than 1.5. The method was validated for the quantification of R-(+)-enantiomer impurity, WCK 1153 in the bulk drug. Calibration curves showed excellent linearity over the concentration range of 0.1 to 1.5 mg/ml for WCK 1152 and 0.01 to 0.15 mg/ml for WCK 1153. Precision of the method was 1.13%. Limit of detection and limit of quantitation of the method for WCK 1152 were 0.0006 mg/ml and 0.0018 mg/ml and for WCK 1153 were 0.0007 mg/ml and 0.0021 mg/ml, respectively. Average recovery of the WCK 1153 in WCK 1152 was 94.4%. This method was employed in determining enantiomeric purity of clinical trial batches of WCK 1152.
