Cyclic nucleotides are small regulatory molecules which transmit signal from receptors positioned on a living cell membrane into the cell interior and regulate multiple biological processes ranging from bacteria to humans. Such regulation occurs through binding of the cyclic nucleotides to the corresponding proteins. All such proteins contain a relatively small domain responsible for the cyclic nucleotide binding. The most important task is to understand how cyclic nucleotide binding (CNB) domains translate the signal into a biological response. In this work, we studied changes in different CNB domains induced by the cyclic nucleotides using a new method for comparison of protein structures: local spatial patterns alignment. This novel method compares protein molecules and detects conserved spatial patterns comprised of similar amino acid residues. Moreover, it ranks the detected residues with respect to their functional or structural importance. Our results show that there are at least two different families of CNB domains. The first family has four structural elements which perform the signal translation. Two of these elements were known previously and two are novel. The second family can translate the signal using only three elements, but they have to work in pairs to provide interaction between the functional elements.
