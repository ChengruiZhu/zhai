 (also known as APR-246) are quinuclidine compounds that rescue the DNA-binding activity of mutant p53 (mut-p53) and restore the potential of wild-type p53. In the current report, we demonstrated that inhibition of poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase-1 (PARP-1) with 6(5H)-phenanthridinone (PHEN) and N-(6-Oxo-5,6-dihydrophenanthridin-2-yl)-(N, N-dimethylamino) acetamide hydrochloride (PJ34) sensitizes UMSCC1, UMSCC14, and UMSCC17A, three HNSCC cell lines to the treatment of APR-246. PHEN enhances APR-246-induced apoptosis, but not programmed necrosis or autophagic cell death in HNSCC cells. The PARP-1 inhibition-induced sensitization of HNSCC cells to APR-246 is independent of TP53 mutation. Instead, PARP-1 inhibition promotes APR-246-facilitated inactivation of thioredoxin reductase 1 (TrxR1), leading to ROS accumulation and DNA damage. Overexpression of TrxR1 or application of antioxidant N-acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC) depletes the ROS increase, reduces DNA damage, and decreases cell death triggered by APR-246/PHEN in HNSCC cells. Thus, we have characterized a new function of PARP-1 inhibitor in HNSCC cells by inactivation of TrxR1 and elevation of ROS and provide a novel therapeutic strategy for HNSCC by the combination of PARP-1 inhibitors and APR-246.
