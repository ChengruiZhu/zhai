The objective of the present study was to evaluate the clinicopathological features and the survival time estimates in patients treated for borderline ovarian tumors (BOTs). A retrospective review of all patients treated for BOTs at the University of Bari (Bari, Italy) between 1991 and 2011 was performed. Data were obtained from hospital records and gynecological oncology charts. A total of 55 patients were identified. The median age was 40 years (range, 13–79 years). The majority of the patients (85.5%) exhibited International Federation of Obstetrics and Gynecology (FIGO) stage I disease and the remainder exhibited FIGO stage II/III (7.3% in each stage). Serous histology was found in 60.0% of the cases and an elevation of the cancer antigen-125 serum level occurred in 23.6% of the cases. All patients underwent surgery and 3.7% received chemotherapy. In total, 10.9% exhibited recurrence and the median survival rate was 39 months. The median survival time and the five-year survival rate were 42 months (range, 16–84 months) and 97%, respectively. Therefore, BOTs have an excellent prognosis. Conservative surgery should be considered for patients of reproductive age who desire preservation of fertility. A long-term follow-up is highly recommended for these tumors.
