The aim of the present study was to identify a specific biological marker for the diagnosis of colorectal adenomas through the analysis of variations in serum protein profiling in colorectal adenoma patients. The study was conducted at the Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University (Wuhan, China) between September 2011 and May 2012. Surface-enhanced laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (SELDI-TOF-MS) was performed to compare the serum protein profiles of 50 patients with colorectal adenoma and 50 healthy individuals. The obtained protein profiles were analyzed using Biomarker Wizard software. Twenty protein peaks were identified to exhibit differences in average intensity between colorectal adenomas compared with normal controls, including peaks 8,565.84, 8,694.51 and 5,910.50 Da, in which the intensity between the patients and control individuals was significantly different. Two peaks, 8,565.84 and 8,694.51 Da, were observed to be highly expressed in the colorectal adenomas, however, expression was low in the control samples. By contrast, 5,910.50 Da expression was low in the colorectal adenomas and high in the controls. The results of the current study indicate that the three protein peaks may represent specific biomarkers for colorectal adenomas.
