The epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor (EGFR-TKI) erlotinib has been approved for years as a first-line therapy for patients harboring EGFR-sensitizing mutations. With the promising implementation of immunotherapeutic strategies for the treatment of lung cancer, there is a growing interest in developing combinatorial therapies that could utilize immune approaches in the context of conventional or targeted therapies. Tumor cells are known to evade immune attack by multiple strategies, including undergoing phenotypic plasticity via a process designated as the epithelialâ€“mesenchymal transition (EMT). As signaling through EGFR is a major inducer of EMT in epithelial cells, we have investigated the effect of EGFR inhibition with erlotinib on tumor phenotype and susceptibility to immune attack. Our data shows that short-term exposure of tumor cells to low-dose erlotinib modulates tumor plasticity and immune-mediated cytotoxicity in lung cancer cells harboring a sensitizing EGFR mutation, leading to a remarkable enhancement of tumor lysis mediated by innate NK cells and antigen-specific T cells. This effect positively correlated with the ability of short-term EGFR blockade to modulate tumor phenotype towards a more epithelial one, as well as to increase susceptibility to caspase-mediated apoptosis. The effect, however, was lost when erlotinib was utilized for long periods of time
