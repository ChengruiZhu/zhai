Comparative genomics is the analysis and comparison of genomes from different species. More then 100 complete genomes of bacteria are now available. Comparative analysis of binding sites for transcriptional regulators is a powerful approach for functional gene annotation. Knowledge of transcriptional regulatory networks is essential for understanding cellular processes in bacteria. The global nitrogen cycle includes interconversion of nitrogen oxides between a number of redox states. Despite the importance of bacterial nitrogen oxides' metabolism for ecology and medicine, our understanding of their regulation is limited. In this study, the researchers have applied comparative genomic approaches to describe a regulatory network of genes involved in the nitrogen oxides' metabolism in bacteria. The described regulatory network involves five nitric oxideâˆ’responsive transcription factors with different DNA recognition motifs. Different combinations of these regulators appear to regulate expression of dozens of genes involved in nitric oxide detoxification and denitrification. The reconstructed network demonstrates considerable interconnection and evolutionary plasticity. Not only are genes shuffled between regulons in different genomes, but there is also considerable interaction between regulators. Overall, the system seems to be quite conserved; however, many regulatory interactions in the identified core regulatory network are taxon-specific. This study demonstrates the power of comparative genomics in the analysis of complex regulatory networks and their evolution.
