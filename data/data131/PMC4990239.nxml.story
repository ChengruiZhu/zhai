The differentiation of distinct somatic and reproductive cells in flowers is required for the successful sexual reproduction of plants. The anther produces reproductive microsporocytes (pollen mother cells) that give rise to pollen (male gametophytes), as well as surrounding somatic cells (particularly the tapetal cells) that support the normal development of pollen. In animals, signals from somatic cells are known to influence reproductive cell fate determination, and vice versa. However, little is known about the molecular mechanisms underlying somatic and reproductive cell fate determination in plants. In this paper, we demonstrate that TPD1 (TAPETUM DETERMINANT1) is processed into a small secreted cysteine-rich protein ligand for the EMS1 (EXCESS MICROSPOROCYTES1) leucine-rich repeat receptor-like kinase (LRR-RLK). TPD1 is secreted from reproductive cells to the plasma membrane of somatic cells, where activated TPD1-EMS1 signaling first promotes periclinal cell division and then determines tapetal cell fate. Moreover, tapetal cells suppress microsporocyte proliferation. Our findings illuminate a novel mechanism by which reproductive cells determine somatic cell fate, and somatic cells in turn limit reproductive cell proliferation. Plants extensively employ LRR-RLKs to control growth, development, and defense. Our identification of TPD1 as the first small protein ligand for all LRR-RLKs characterized to date will provide a valuable system for studying how small protein ligands activate LRR-RLK signaling complexes.
