The effect of low pH on the kinetics of Na channel ionic and gating currents was studied in frog skeletal muscle fibers. Lowering external pH from 7.4 to 5.0 slows the time course of Na current consistent with about a +25-mV shift in the voltage dependence of activation and inactivation time constants. Similar shifts in voltage dependence adequately describe the effects of low pH on the tail current time constant (+23.3 mV) and the gating charge vs. voltage relationship (+22.1 mV). A significantly smaller shift of +13.3 mV described the effect of pH 5.0 solution on the voltage dependence of steady state inactivation. Changes in the time course of gating current at low pH were complex and could not be described as a shift in voltage dependence. tau g, the time constant that describes the time course of the major component of gating charge movement, was slowed in pH 5.0 solution by a factor of approximately 3.5 for potentials from -60 to +45 mV. We conclude that the effects of low pH on Na channel gating cannot be attributed simply to a change in surface potential. Therefore, although it may be appropriate to describe the effect of low pH on some Na channel kinetic properties as a "shift" in voltage dependence, it is not appropriate to interpret such shifts as a measure of changes in surface potential. The maximum gating charge elicited from a holding potential of -150 mV was little affected by low pH.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
