This study aimed to identify the cause of atypical shape of measured concentration-time profile in the peak area by one compartment open model with a lag time (Bateman function with a lag) after single dose oral administration of drug published in “Pharmacokinetic and Pharmacodynamic Data Analysis: Concepts and Application” by Gabrielsson and Weiner (1997) and two concentration profiles after frequent sampling oral glucose tolerance test. Following the oral administration of 100 μg of substance A to human volunteer, frequent sampling was carried out and concentration-time profiles were obtained. Our hemodynamic circulatory structural model capable of parameters estimation of circulation and gastrointestinal subsystem to explain the plateau within the interval 40-100 min (substance A) and 15-30 min (glucose) of the measured concentration-time profile was developed. The mean residence time, the rate constants of absorption and elimination parameters of our model were calculated. Comparing to the Bateman function, our results demonstrate better approximation of the substance A and glucose concentration-time profile and estimation of absorption rate constant by our structural model. Obtained model results indicate that the atypical shape of measured concentration-time profile of single dose oral administration of drug was probably caused by the gastrointestinal and circulation system with deep compartment. This applies to the substances with high coefficient of absorption.
