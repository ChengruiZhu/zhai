First branchial cleft anomalies are rare with the average age of presentation as 19 years. There is an average delay of 3.5 years between initial presentation and adequate treatment due to diagnostic dilemma. A very rare variant of first branchial cleft anomaly presenting as a post-auricular salivary fistula is reported. A 12-year-old girl presented with a history of intermittent watery discharge, more so at the time of meals from a right post-auricular opening for last 3 years. Computed tomography sialography revealed a fistulous tract connecting the sub segmental duct of the parotid gland extending along the pre-tragus region in subcutaneous plane up to mastoid tip after passing inferior to external auditory canal. Superficial parotidectomy with identification of facial nerve branches was carried out for excision of the tract. Histopathology revealed sinus tract comprising of ectodermal components and acini of the parotid gland. We classified our case into work's type-2 based on anatomical location at an angle of mandible, its relationship to parotid gland and facial nerve and previous history of ear discharge. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first case of its type to be reported.
