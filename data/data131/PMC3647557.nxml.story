A wide range of microalbuminuria cutoff values are currently used for diagnosing the early stage of nephropathy in type 2 diabetes (T2D). This study analyzed the relationships between oxidant and antioxidant markers of nephropathy and the severity of microalbuminuria. The study included 50 healthy controls (Group 1), 50 diabetic patients with no nephropathy (Group 2), 50 diabetic patients with nephropathy and a urinary albumin excretion (UAE) of 30–200 mg/24 h (Group 3), and 50 diabetic patients with UAE 200–300 mg/24 h (Group 4). Serum nitrotyrosine, conjugated dienes, 8-hydroxy-2′-deoxyguanosine (8-OHdG), superoxide dismutase (SOD), and total antioxidant capacity (T-AOC) levels were determined. Oxidative stress is increased in the early stage of nephropathy in patients with T2D. There was a significant correlation between the extent of microalbuminuria and markers of oxidative stress. Multiple linear regression analysis identified lipid oxidative stress as a possible independent marker for evaluating the degree of renal damage in diabetic nephropathy. Stratifying microalbuminuria values during the early stage of nephropathy might be an important factor in facilitating earlier and more specific interventions.
