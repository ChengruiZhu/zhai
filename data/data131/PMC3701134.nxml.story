The actual incidence of renal dysfunction after contrast media administration seems to be underestimated, especially in the context of epidemiological data. There are only few data concerning the monitoring of impaired kidney function within a few hours after iodine contrast medium application. Hence, the purpose of this study is to observe the incidence of early renal function deterioration within 12–18 h after administration of iodine contrast media in patients scheduled for elective coronary angiography, who were intravenously and orally hydrated. In addition, the project aims to reclassify the contrast induced nephropathy phenomenon, by identification of early markers of renal dysfunction. Morphology, electrolytes, blood urea nitrogen (BUN), creatinine, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, triglycerides, high-density lipoprotein, and total cholesterol levels were assessed with the use of typical laboratory techniques in 319 patients referred for coronary angiography. We demonstrated that early deterioration of renal function in patients 12–18 h after administration of contrast during imaging tests (even when appropriate prophylactic hydration was used), may occurred just as an increase (or no change) of serum creatinine level and BUN level and a decrease of creatinine clearance and glomerular filtration rate. Depending on the parameter, the phenomenon can be found in 13–28 % of all respondents. Early renal function impairment defined as above was almost 2 and 2.22 × 10
