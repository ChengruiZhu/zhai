Astrocytes are major components of the adult neurogenic niche and play a crucial role in regulating neural stem cell proliferation and differentiation. Following brain injury, astrocytes become reactive and release high-mobility group box 1 (HMGB1), which plays a crucial role in the inflammatory process. However, although it has been reported that HMGB1 promotes neural stem/progenitor cell (NS/PC) proliferation in the developing brain, whether HMGB1 released by reactive astrocytes regulates NS/PC proliferation remains unknown. In this study, we aimed to investigate whether HMGB1 released from reactive astrocytes enhances NS/PC proliferation and to elucidate the possible mechanisms involved in this process. To evaluate the effects of HMGB1 on NS/PC proliferation, NS/PCs were cultured in HMGB1 culture medium and astrocyte-conditioned medium with or without reactive astrocyte-derived HMGB1 by RNA interference (RNAi). To explore the possible mechanisms, the HMGB1 receptor for advanced glycation endproducts (RAGE) in the NS/PCs was blocked with anti-RAGE antibody, and c-Jun N-terminal protein kinase (JNK) in the NS/PCs was inhibited using the potent JNK inhibitor, SP600125. Our results suggested that HMGB1 released from reactive astrocytes promoted NS/PC proliferation
