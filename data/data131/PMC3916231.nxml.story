Sensory neurons located in dorsal root ganglia are critical for perception of various stimuli by transmitting information from their peripheral targets to the spinal cord. During embryonic development, distinct populations of sensory neurons are defined based on expression of neurotrophin receptors Trks. Pain and temperature sensing neurons, or nociceptors, express NGF receptor TrkA, which control a number of diverse developmental processes, such as survival, gene expression and skin innervation. How these distinct processes are regulated by activation of same Trk receptor is currently unknown. Using a knock in approach, we generated a mouse with nociceptive neurons expressing a modified TrkA/TrkC receptor, which responds to NGF but signals through the intracellular part of another neurotrophin receptor, TrkC. Contrary to all previously reported NGF and TrkA mutants, these mice were viable and exhibited no obvious defects. Surprisingly, nociceptive neurons from these mice survived and matured normally, but failed to correctly innervate their peripheral target, skin. Thus, the intracellular parts of highly related receptors TrkA and TrkC are interchangeable for support of certain developmental processes but not others. Moreover, adult TrkA/TrkC mice exhibited drastic defects in pain sensation, making it an excellent model to study the role of NGF in nociception.
