The aim of the present study was to assess the influence of various workplace parameters and oral health behaviors on tooth decay, periodontal disease, and the number of teeth present in industrial workers. The study participants were 1,078 workers (808 males, 270 females, mean age 42.8 Â± 11.4 yr) employed at 11 different workplaces. Oral examinations and a self-administered questionnaire were conducted for participants. A logistic regression analysis was conducted to identify factors related to their oral health status. Factors significantly associated with decayed teeth were smoking (OR=2.02), not having received tooth brushing instruction (OR=1.73), not having annual dental examinations (OR=1.64) and not brushing before sleeping (OR=0.55). The factors significantly associated with severe periodontal disease were employment with a company with fewer than 50 employees (OR=15.56) and not brushing teeth before bedtime (OR=2.41). The factors significantly associated with having 23 teeth or fewer were subjects in the education and learning support industry compared with manufacturing industry (OR=5.83) and transport industry (OR=12.01). The results of the present study showed that various occupational parameters and health behaviors are associated with oral health status including tooth decay, periodontal disease, and tooth loss.
