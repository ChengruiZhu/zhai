Total mouse testis RNA directs the synthesis of the sperm-specific C subunit of lactate dehydrogenase-X (LDH-X) when translated in a cell- free system derived from rabbit reticulocytes. The newly synthesized C subunits were isolated by immunoprecipitation with antibody specific for this isozyme, and quantitated by electrophoresis on SDS polyacrylamide gels. The amount of radioactivity incorporated into the enzyme subunit was directly proportional to the amount of testis RNA added to the translational system, thereby providing a sensitive and reliable method for assessing relative LDH-X mRNA activity. A combination of sucrose gradient centrifugation and oligo(dT)-cellulose chromatography resulted in a 23-fold purification of LDH-X mRNA over total cytoplasmic testis RNA. Analysis of LDH-X mRNA activity in the developing testis indicated that the appearance of functional LDH-X mRNA activity coincides with the appearance of LDH-X catalytic activity at 14 d postpartum. Measurement of LDH-X mRNA levels in separated testis cell populations prepared by centrifugal elutriation demonstrated that LDH-X mRNA represents 0.17-0.18% of the total functional mRNA activity in fractions enriched in pachytene spermatocytes and round spermatids, but only 0.09-0.10% of the translation products of elongated spermatids.
