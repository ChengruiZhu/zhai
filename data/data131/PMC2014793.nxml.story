At the core of the human adaptive immune response is the train-to-kill mechanism in which specialized immune cells are sensitized to recognize small peptides from foreign pathogens (e.g., HIV virus). Following this sensitization, these cells are then activated to kill other cells that display this same peptide (and that are infected by this same pathogen). However, for sensitization and killing to occur, the pathogen peptide must be “paired up” with one of the infected person's other specialized immune molecules—an HLA (human leukocyte antigen) molecule. The way in which pathogen peptides interact with these HLA molecules defines if and how an immune response will be generated, which has implications for vaccine design where one may artificially introduce select peptides to pre-train the immune system. Furthermore, there is a huge repertoire of such HLA molecules, with almost no two people having the same set. We introduce a statistical approach for identifying which HLA molecules interact with which pathogen peptides, given a particular kind of laboratory data. Our approach takes as input, data that tells us only which pathogen peptides generate a response, but not which HLA molecules support the response. Our statistical approach fills in this missing information.
