To grow optimally, photosynthetic organisms need to constantly adjust to changing light conditions. One of these adjustments, called state transitions, allows light energy to be redistributed between the two photosynthetic reaction center complexes in a cell's chloroplasts. These complexes act in concert with other components of the photosynthetic machinery to turn light energy into cellular energy. A key component in the regulation of state transitions is the chloroplast protein Stt7 (also known as STN7), which can modify other proteins by adding a phosphate group. When light levels change, the oxidation level of a pool of another chloroplast component, plastoquinone, changes, which in turn activates Stt7, inducing it to phosphorylate specific proteins of the light-harvesting complex of one reaction center. As a result, a portion of this light-harvesting complex is transferred from one photosynthetic reaction center to the other, thereby optimizing photosynthetic efficiency. Here, we have addressed the configuration of Stt7 within the thylakoid membrane of the chloroplast and the molecular mechanisms underlying its activation. Our data reveal that the level of Stt7 protein changes drastically under specific environmental conditions, that the protein does not need to be present in a one-to-one ratio with its targets for activity, and that it associates directly with a number of components of the photosynthetic machinery. The protein-modifying domain of Stt7 is exposed to the outer side of the thylakoid membrane, whereas the domain critical for regulation of its activity lies on the inner side of the thylakoid membrane. These results shed light on the molecular mechanisms that allow photosynthetic organisms to adjust to fluctuations in light levels.
