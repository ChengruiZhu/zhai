Previous results regarding the prognostic value of the neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) and platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio (PLR) in gastric cancer are conflicting, and full analysis of other blood test parameters are lacking. We therefore examined the associations between various blood test parameters and prognosis in 3243 gastric cancer patients randomly divided into training (n=1621) and validation (n=1622) sets. Optimal cut-off values of 0.663 for neutrophil-to-white blood cell ratio (NWR), 0.288 for lymphocyte-to-white blood cell ratio (LWR), 0.072 for monocyte-to-white blood cell ratio (MWR), 2.604 for NLR, 0.194 for monocyte-to-lymphocyte ratio (MLR), and 130.675 for PLR were identified in the training set. Univariate and survival analyses revealed that high NWR, low LWR, high MWR, high NLR, high MLR, and high PLR are all associated with a poor prognosis in gastric cancer. However, multivariate analysis revealed that only LWR, and MWR are independent prognostic predictors, and prognostic value increased when LWR and MWR were considered in combination. These findings suggest that low LWR and high MWR are each predictive of a poor prognosis, and exhibit greater prognostic value when considered in combination.
