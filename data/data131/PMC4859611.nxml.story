Eukaryotic genes differ from their prokaryotic counterparts in having intervening non-coding sequences called introns. The precise biological role of introns in eukaryotic systems remains unclear even more than forty years after their initial discovery. One function of intron that has been remarkably conserved during evolution is their ability to enhance the transcription of genes that harbor them. How does the intron regulate transcription, however, is not known. Here we show that the intron enhances gene expression by affecting direction of the promoter-initiated transcription. In the presence of an intron, polymerase tends to transcribe the downstream coding region producing mRNA, while in the absence of a splicing-competent intron polymerase starts transcribing promoter upstream region producing upstream antisense RNA (uaRNA). Intron-mediated promoter directionality was dependent on gene looping, which is the interaction off the promoter and terminator region of a gene in a transcription-dependent manner. We show that the intron-dependent gene looping facilitates the recruitment of termination factors in the promoter-proximal region. The recruited termination factors stop uaRNA synthesis thereby conferring directionality to the promoter-bound polymerase.
