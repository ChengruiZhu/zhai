SHARPIN (Shank-associated RH domain interacting protein) is the main component of the linear ubiquitin chain activation complex (LUBAC). SHARPIN is involved in regulating inflammation and cancer progression. However, whether SHARPIN plays an important role in lung cancer metastasis and the potential underlying mechanism are still unknown. Here, for the first time, we reported that SHARPIN expression is closely related to lung cancer progression. Moreover, SHARPIN plays a central role in controlling lung cancer cell metastasis. Mechanistic studies further revealed that PRMT5 (Protein arginine methyltransferase 5), responsible for catalyzing arginine methylation on histones, is a novel cofactor of SHARPIN. This finding provides the basis for further study of the crosstalk between protein ubiquitination and histone methylation. We further found that SHARPIN-PRMT5 is essential for the monomethylation of histones of chromatins at key metastasis-related genes, defining a new mechanism regulating cancer invasion. A novel MLL complex (ASH2 and WDR5) was implied in the link between histone arginine2 monomethylation (H3R2me1) and histone lysine4 trimethylation (H3K4me3) for the activation of metastasis-related genes. These novel findings establish a new epigenetic paradigm in which SHARPIN-PRMT5 has distinct roles in orchestrating chromatin environments for cancer-related genes via integrating signaling between H3R2me1 and H3K4me3.
