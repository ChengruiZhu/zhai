Both TRIM and ZL006 decreased immobility time in Wistar Kyoto rats in the forced swimming test. Exposure to the forced swimming test increased c-FOS immunoreactivity in the lateral septum, paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus, periaqueductal grey, dentate gyrus, and ventral CA1 of the hippocampus compared with non-forced swimming test-exposed controls. Forced swimming test-induced c-FOS immunoreactivity was further increased in the lateral septum, periaqueductal gray, and paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus following treatment with TRIM or ZL006. By contrast, forced swimming test-induced c-FOS immunoreactivity was reduced in dorsal dentate gyrus and ventral CA1 following treatment with TRIM or ZL006. Exposure to the forced swimming test resulted in an increase in NADPH diaphorase staining in the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus. This forced swimming test-induced increase was attenuated following treatment with ZL006 and points to the paraventricular nucleus as a brain region where ZL006 acts to attenuate forced swimming test-induced neuronal nitric oxide synthase activity while concomitantly regulating region specific neuronal activation associated with an antidepressant-related response.
