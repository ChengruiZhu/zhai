, which isconsidered as the functional composition among a series of compounds. It exhibited effective role in various diseases by inhibiting inflammation response. In our study, the protective effects and anti-inflammatory activity of juglanin were investigated in mice and lung cells treated by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) to reveal the possible mechanism by which juglanin attenuates acute lung injury. The mice were separated into four groups. The mouse model was established with 15 mg/kg LPS injection. Juglanin dramatically reduced the inflammation of cell infiltration. Compared to mice only treated with LPS, LPS-treated mice in the presence of juglanin developed less lung fibrosis with lower levels of α-smooth muscle-actin (α-SMA), collagen type I, collagen type III, and transforming growth factor-β1 (TGF-β1). Additionally, juglanin markedly downregulated inflammatory cytokine secretion and phosphorylated nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) expression via inhibiting IKKα/IκBα signaling pathway. Our results indicate that juglanin has a protective role in LPS-triggered acute lung injury via suppression of fibrosis and inflammation response by NF-κB signaling pathways inactivation. Thus, juglanin may be a potential candidate as dietary supplement for acute lung injury for children in future.
