All cells face the challenge of removing transmembrane proteins from the lipid bilayer for the purpose of signaling or degradation. One molecular solution to this problem is the multiprotein enzyme complex γ-secretase, which is able to hydrolyze several known transmembrane proteins within the hydrophobic lipid environment. Due to its central role in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer disease, modulation of γ-secretase activity has become a therapeutic goal. However, the number and diversity of proteins that can be cleaved by this protease remain unknown, and the attributes that target these proteins to γ-secretase are unclear. In this study, we used an unbiased approach to substrate identification and surveyed the proteome for targets of γ-secretase. Of the thousands of proteins detectable, only a relative few were substrates of γ-secretase, all of which were type I transmembrane proteins. In addition to validating several of these novel substrates, we compared them to other proteins that we identified as nonsubstrates and determined that there are specific domains that can activate or inhibit γ-secretase processing. These findings should advance our understanding of the many cellular processes regulated by γ-secretase and may offer insights into how γ-secretase can be exploited for therapeutic purposes.
