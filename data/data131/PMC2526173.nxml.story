Proteins are the main building blocks and functional molecules of the cell. Function is mediated by specific amino acid residues in a protein sequence, in a manner dependent on both their positions and types. Proteins are traditionally described as a sequence of amino acids and, when known, the experimentally determined coordinates of this covalently linked chain. Here we propose to expand the description of a protein to include a quantitative measure of the functional importance for each constituent amino acid. The resulting signature for a protein sequence or structure is referred to as its meta-functional signature (MFS). We present an ensemble of knowledge- and biophysics-based methods, which exploit different types of evidence for functional importance, as an automated publicly available tool to build such an MFS. We use two benchmark datasets to show that MFS can be used to identify functionally important residues from protein structure or sequence alone. Finally, we assess four diverse real-world biological questions to demonstrate the ability of MFS to give insight into the structural and functional roles of individual residues and positions, by exploiting protein sequence–structure–function relationships.
