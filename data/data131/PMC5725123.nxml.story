To improve the therapeutic efficacy of spinal cord injury (SCI), the methylprednisolone was incorporated into nanoparticles based on the ibuprofen modified dextran. The ibuprofen modified dextran was synthesized using a direct esterification linkage between the carboxylic acids of hydrophobic drug and the hydroxyl groups of the polymer backbone. The morphology of methylprednisolone loaded nanoparticles was evaluated by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and dynamic light scattering (DLS). The therapeutic efficacy of the prepared nanoparticles on the acute SCI model rats was assessed. It is demonstrated that methylprednisolone loaded ibuprofen modified dextran based nanoparticles (MP-loaded NPs) could promote the recovery of neurological deficits, enhance growth of neurons, decrease degeneration of injuried neurons and reduce the tissue tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-Î±) levels significantly in the SCI rats. Subsequently, the study indicates that synthesis of methylprednisolone loaded ibuprofen modified dextran based nanoparticles has a great potential in the synergetic effect treatment for spinal cord injury and nanoparticles based drug delivery system will become a powerful weapon of human conquest of disease.
