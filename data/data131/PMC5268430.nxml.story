Human lungs are constantly exposed to inhaled chemicals that have the potential to damage cellular DNA. Lung stem cells must therefore have the ability to repair DNA damage to survive and achieve tissue homeostasis. Lung airways are composed of different types of cells, including basal cells, which have been proposed to be the stem cells of the lung. Here, we show that lung basal stem cells have a superior ability to resolve DNA damage compared to alveolar progenitor cells, thus allowing these cells to survive and proliferate after injury. Accordingly, basal stem cells isolated from patients with a long history of tobacco smoking had remarkable proliferative potential compared to those extracted from never smokers. However, we demonstrate that basal stem cells predominately use nonhomologous end joining to repair DNA double-strand breaks, a notoriously error-prone pathway. A subset of polyploid basal stem cells was observed in cigarette-smoking patients, pointing to the accumulation of genetic instability in these long-lived cells. Gene expression analyses revealed that lung squamous cell carcinoma, a subtype of lung cancer that almost exclusively occurs in smokers, carries a transcriptional fingerprint of basal cells, suggesting that lung basal stem cells could be the cells of origin of this subtype of lung cancer. We postulate that further unravelling of DNA repair in lung cells may lead to potential therapeutic targets in the prevention or treatment of lung diseases.
