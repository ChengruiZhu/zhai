Anal squamous cell carcinoma was a previously uncommon malignancy that has steadily increased in incidence with the increased prevalence of human papillomavirus (HPV) and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Anal squamous cell carcinoma is typically characterized by local and regional involvement and distant metastases are far less common. Here, we report a case of a 36-year-old female initially diagnosed with anal squamous cell carcinoma manifesting as an anal mass along with an enlarged inguinal lymph node. After receiving chemoradiation therapy, she remained disease-free until recently, when she presented with an isolated left infraclavicular lymph node found on physical examination followed by a biopsy that was consistent with recurrent anal squamous cell carcinoma. The positron emission tomography–computed tomography (PET-CT) uptake of her original left inguinal lymph node was decreased, suggesting improved regional disease, and no other metastases were found. Our case represents a rare occurrence of metastatic anal squamous cell carcinoma to an isolated distal lymph node and reminds physicians not to forget a unusual site of metastasis and prevent any delay in treatment.
