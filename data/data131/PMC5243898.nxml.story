Drought has become more frequent in Central Europe causing large losses in cereal yields, especially of spring crops. The development of new varieties with increased tolerance to drought is a key tool for improvement of agricultural productivity. Material for the study consisted of 100 barley recombinant inbred lines (RILs) (LCam) derived from the cross between Syrian and European parents. The RILs and parental genotypes were examined in greenhouse experiments under well-watered and water-deficit conditions. During vegetation the date of heading, yield and yield-related traits were measured. RIL population was genotyped with microsatellite and single nucleotide polymorphism markers. This population, together with two other populations, was the basis for the consensus map construction, which was used for identification of quantitative trait loci (QTLs) affecting the traits. The studied lines showed a large variability in heading date. It was noted that drought-treatment negatively affected the yield and its components, especially when applied at the flag leaf stage. In total, 60 QTLs were detected on all the barley chromosomes. The largest number of QTLs was found on chromosome 2H. The main QTL associated with heading, located on chromosome 2H (Q.HD.LC-2H), was identified at SNP marker 5880â€“2547, in the vicinity of
