Programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) is thought to play a critical role in immune escape by cancer, but whether PD-L1 expression can influence prognosis of patients with solid tumors is controversial. Therefore, we meta-analyzed available data on whether PD-L1 expression correlates with overall survival (OS) in such patients. PubMed, EMBASE and other databases were systematically searched for cohort or case-control studies examining the possible correlation between PD-L1 expression and OS of patients with solid tumors. OS was compared between patients positive or negative for PD-L1 expression using scatter plots, and subgroup analyses were performed based on tumor type and patient characteristics. Data from 59 studies involving 20,004 patients with solid tumors were meta-analyzed. The median percentage of tumors positive for PD-L1 was 30.1%. OS was significantly lower in PD-L1-positive patients than in PD-L1-negative patients at 1 year (P = 0.039), 3 years (P < 0.001) and 5 years (P < 0.001). The risk ratios of OS (and associated 95% confidence intervals) were 2.02 (1.56-2.60) at 1 year, 1.57 (1.34-1.83) at 3 years and 1.43 (1.24-1.64) at 5 years. Similar results were obtained in subgroup analyses based on patient ethnicity or tumor type. The available evidence suggests that PD-L1 expression negatively affects the prognosis of patients with solid tumors. PD-L1 might serve as an efficient prognostic indicator in solid tumor and may represent the important new therapeutic target.
