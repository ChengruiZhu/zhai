Tumor heterogeneity exists in many human cancers, and it has been shown that it can play a role in tumor progression. Indeed, cell diversity may be critically important when tumors experience selective pressures, like nutrient deprivation, hypoxia, chemotherapy. PKA, through incompletely understood mechanisms, controls several cellular processes like cell growth, cell differentiation, cell metabolism, cell migration and, as more recently observed, also cancer progression. In this work, we show that activation of PKA induces the ability of a cancer cell sub-population to survive under strong stress conditions namely nutrient deprivation and cell detachment. Indeed, PKA activation in these cells results in autophagy induction, and at the same time, in activation of glutamine metabolism and Src kinase. Importantly, blocking directly the PKA pathway, as well as the autophagy, the glutamine metabolism or the Src pathway by inhibitory drugs, almost completely prevents cell growth of this sub-population of resistant cancer cells. These results suggest that drugs, targeting especially PKA pathway as well as downstream processes like autophagy, glutamine metabolism and Src signaling, may specifically inhibit cancer cells ability to survive under selective pressure favoring cancer resistance.
