To date, mechanistic mathematical modeling, in general, has not played a significant role in the development of new therapies for cancer, cardiovascular diseases, or the treatment of acute events like thrombosis during surgery. One critical issue often cited for the lack of interest has been uncertainty; the conventional wisdom is that the data requirement to fully determine and validate large mechanistic models is just too high. We show, using tools from systems biology and sensitivity analysis, that it may be possible to extract qualitative information about the critical elements of human relevant cascades despite model uncertainty. Using a mechanistic model of the human coagulation cascade, we were able to identify the critical mechanisms controlling the formation of thrombin, a key protein active in the formation of blood clots. We were further able to support the hypothesis that the critical mechanisms identified by our analysis could serve as drug targets by comparing our findings with the thrombosis treatment literature and with current clinical trials. The results support the notion that mechanistic models could be used, despite model uncertainty, to pinpoint key mechanisms in complex networks, and that these mechanisms could potentially be therapeutically exploited.
