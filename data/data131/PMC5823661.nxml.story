Most patients diagnosed with thoracic esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) have progressed beyond surgical resection as a therapeutic option. Difficulties in the proper assessment of tumor invasion depth before treatment complicate determination of the type and extent of therapy. Therefore, accurate tumor clinical staging is a necessity for identifying treatment options and aiding in patient prognosis. We investigated radiographic factors as prognostic indicators for survival in ESCC. Between July 2006 - July 2010, 324 thoracic ESCC patients who underwent surgery were selected. All patients received contrast enhanced preoperative chest CT scans and esophageal barium swallow examinations. Measurement of maximal lesion cross-sectional area, the largest long diameter, largest short diameter, CT-indicated lesion length, barium-indicated lesion length and the length of pericardial fat reduction were performed. Relationships between these indicators and post-surgical survival time and the cutoff values of related factors were analyzed. Maximum long diameter, maximum lesion area and lesion length, as measured by CT imaging, were correlated with survival. Survival effects were clearly associated with group intervals, calculated by a genetic algorithm, and tumor stages. Risk-stratification intervals of esophageal lesions from radiographic imaging included: maximum long diameter < 28.7, 28.7-34.6mm, 34.6-41.4mm and >41.4mm; maximum lesion area < 355.8mm
