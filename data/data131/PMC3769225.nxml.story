Allostery is a process by which a molecule binding to one site of a protein alters the activity of the protein at another site. Allostery is typically thought to occur through a change in protein structure, but there is now clear evidence that the dynamic properties of a protein can also regulate allostery without a change in overall conformation. Here we examine two members of a large family of bacterial transcription factors and provide a mechanism to describe the allosteric binding of their activating ligands. We demonstrate, in these systems, that allostery arises as a natural consequence of changes in global low-frequency protein fluctuations on ligand binding. We further demonstrate that the higher dimensional parameter space that describes all potential variant transcription factors can be reduced to a two-dimensional free energy landscape that determines the key molecular parameters that predominantly regulate allostery. We additionally show that the amino acids we determine as contributing sensitively to allosteric control tend to be conserved in diverse bacteria; thus we identify a link between residues that contribute to low-frequency fluctuations and evolutionary selection pressures.
