Atherosclerosis is present in the major arteries of all adults. In industrial societies, atherosclerosis progression in ∼50% of adults leads to clinical manifestations such as stroke and myocardial infarction, and eventually death. Lowering circulating LDL-cholesterol levels can slow atherosclerosis progression and even cause regression. Yet, little is known about the genes in the atherosclerotic arterial wall that mediate those effects. To identify such genes, we studied genetically modified mice in which high levels of human-like LDL-cholesterol cause rapid progression of atherosclerosis; the mice also had a genetic “switch” to lower LDL-cholesterol. Lowering LDL-cholesterol at a critical point before advanced plaques developed stopped lesion progression. Analysis of gene expression in response to the lowering of plasma LDL-cholesterol revealed 37 lesion genes as possible mediators of this effect. We validated some of these genes in macrophages using siRNA incubated with acetylated-LDL to mimic foam cells, which are central to atherosclerosis progression. “Reverse engineering” of whole-genome expression data from these experiments revealed a regulatory gene network of cholesterol-responsive atherosclerosis genes that control foam cell formation. This network and the individual genes within it merit further attention as targets for drugs to prevent the transformation of early harmless lesions into advanced, clinically significant plaques.
