In groups A and B, the mean levels of PRP before the study were 348000 and 340000/µL respectively. The ADPs were also 73/76 and 68/07 µM that showed no significant difference (P > 0.05).The Means of ADP5 in group A before and after the study were 66.40 and 43.84 µM respectively that there was significant difference (P = 0.001). The Means of ADP5 in group B before and after the study were 58.04 and 40.16 µM respectively that there was significant difference (P < 0.001).The Means of ADP20 in group A before and after the study were 73.76 and 54.97 µM respectively which showed significant difference (P < 0.001). The Means of ADP20 in group B before and after the study were 68.07 and 52.49 µM respectively which showed significant difference (P = 0.001). Difference of ADP5 between group A and B was not significant (P = 0.495). Difference of ADP20 between group A and B was not significant (P = 0.721). The Means of PRP in group A before and after the study were 348000 and 335000/ µL respectively that there was no significant difference (P = 0.66). The Means of PRP in group B before and after the study were 340000 and 336000/ µL respectively that indicated no significant difference (P = 0.81). Difference of PRP between group A and B was not significant (P = 0.563).
