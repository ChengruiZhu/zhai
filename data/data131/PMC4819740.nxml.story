Although participation of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) in reproductive tract remodeling has been strongly suggested in mammalian species, the role of MMPs in the avian oviduct has received little attention. To gain a better understanding of the potential role of the MMP system in avian oviduct development, mRNA and protein expression, localization of selected MMPs and their tissue inhibitors (TIMPs), and gelatinolytic activity in the oviduct of growing chickens were examined. The oviducts were collected from Hy-Line Brown hens before (10, 12, 14 and 16Â weeks of age) and after (week 17) the onset of egg laying. The MMP-2, -7, -9 and TIMP-2 and -3 genes were found to be differentially expressed in all examined oviductal sections: the infundibulum, magnum, isthmus and shell gland on both mRNA (by real time polymerase chain reaction) and protein (by western blotting and immunohistochemistry) levels. In the course of oviduct development, the relative expression of all genes decreased in most sections. Protein level of MMP-9 was diminished, while MMP-7 and TIMP-3 were elevated in the oviduct of growing birds. MMP-2 and TIMP-2 protein levels remained constant, with a slight increase in MMP-2 concentration just before reaching maturity. The relative activity of MMP-2 and -9 (assessed by gelatin zymography) was higher (
