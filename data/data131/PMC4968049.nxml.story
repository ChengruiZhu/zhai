126 patients were selected (80% males). Patients were mostly Italians (92%). 79% had undetectable HIV-RNA and 44% were co-infected by HBV and/or HCV. Median age at switch was 47 years (IQR 43-55). A small but significant decrease in serum creatinine [from 1.06 mg/dl (SD: 0.3) to 0.94 mg/dl (SD: 0.2); p<0.001] with an improvement in eGFR [from 86.8 ml/min (SD: 33) to 96.4 ml/min (SD: 37); p<0.001] were observed in per protocol analysis at month 18. Also ITT analysis showed a decrease in mean serum creatinine [from 1.08 mg/dl (SD: 0.35) to 0.95 mg/dl (SD: 0.24); p<0.001] with an improvement in mean eGFR [from 86.9 ml/min/1.73m2 (SD: 24.11) to 95.8 ml/min/1.73m2 (SD: 19.99); p<0.001]. Total cholesterol increased [from 188 mg/dl (SD: 42) to 206 mg/dl (SD: 44); p<0.001] but also HDL increased as well [from 46 mg/dl (SD: 14) to 54 mg/dl (SD: 19); p=0.015]. An increase in triglycerides concentration was observed [from 162 mg/dl (SD: 144) to 214 mg/dl (SD: 109); p=0.027] in per protocol analysis. Also ITT analysis showed increases of both total cholesterol [from 187 mg/dl (SD: 43.69) to 203 mg/dl (SD: 44.10); p<0.001] and HDL fraction [from 46 mg/dl (SD: 15.49) to 52 mg/dl (SD: 17.13); p=0.002] at month 18.
