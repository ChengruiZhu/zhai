G proteinâ€“coupled receptors (GPCRs) are transmembrane proteins involved in physiological functions ranging from vasodilation and immune response to memory. The binding of both endogenous ligands (e.g., hormones, neurotransmitters) and exogenous ligands (e.g., pharmaceuticals) to these receptors initiates intracellular events that ultimately lead to cell responses. We describe a dynamic model for G protein activation, an immediate outcome of GPCR signaling, and use it together with efficient parameter variation and sensitivity analysis techniques to identify the key cell- and ligand-specific parameters that influence G protein activation. Our results show that although ligand-specific parameters do strongly influence cell response (either causing increases or decreases in G protein activation), cellular parameters may also dictate the magnitude and direction of G protein activation. We apply our findings to describe how protean agonism, a phenomenon in which the same ligand may induce both positive and negative responses, may result from changes in cell-specific parameters. These findings may be used to understand the molecular basis of different responses of cell types and tissues to pharmacological treatment. In addition, these methods may be applied generally to models of cellular signaling and will help guide experimental resources toward further characterization of the key parameters in these networks.
