In this manuscript, we introduce efficient methods for parameter estimation for stochastic processes. The stochasticity of chemical reactions can influence the average behavior of the considered system. For some biological systems, a microscopic, stochastic description is computationally intractable but a macroscopic, deterministic description too inaccurate. This inaccuracy manifests itself in an error in parameter estimates, which impede the predictive power of the proposed model. Until now, no rigorous analysis on the magnitude of the estimation error exists. We show by means of two simulation examples that using mesoscopic descriptions based on the system size expansions and moment-closure approximations can reduce this estimation error compared to inference using a macroscopic description. This reduction is most pronounced in an intermediate volume regime where the influence of stochasticity on the average behavior is moderately strong. For the JAK/STAT pathway where experimental data is available, we show that one parameter that was not structurally identifiable when using a macroscopic description becomes structurally identifiable when using a mesoscopic description for parameter estimation.
