Of a total of 2818 suicide attempters in Japan who presented to the primary or secondary emergency department of Iwate Medical University Hospital (hereinafter, referred to as our hospital) or Iwate Prefecture Advanced Emergency and Critical Care Center (hereinafter, referred to as the emergency center), an affiliated institution to our hospital, during the 12-year period from April 1, 2002–March 31, 2014, 2274 patients for whom the timing of development of suicidal ideation was identified were included in the study. The study subjects were classified into three groups according to the timing of development of suicide ideation: the “same-day” group, those who developed suicidal ideation and attempted suicide on the same day; the “short-term” group, those who developed suicidal ideation 2–7 days before attempting suicide; and the “long-term” group, those who developed suicidal ideation more than 7 days before attempting suicide. Factors associated with the development of suicidal ideation in each group were analyzed by a multiple logistic regression analysis with background factors, the diagnosis according to the ICD and the situations before and after the suicide attempt as explanatory variables.
