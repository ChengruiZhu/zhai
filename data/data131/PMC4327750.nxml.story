 species including eggplant have been studied. PPOs have been implicated in undesirable enzymatic browning of eggplant fruit and also in plant defense. The main objective of this study was to identify and accelerate the further functional characterization of additional eggplant PPOs that are involved in food biochemistry and defense-related functions. Eggplant PPOs identified earlier were used in “Basic local alignment search tool (BLAST)” search against expressed sequence tag and nucleotide databases. We have identified seven additional sequences which were almost complete in length. The sequences of the PPOs were aligned and their phylogenetic and evolutionary relationships established. The sequences are quite diverse, broadly falling into two major clusters; three PPOs form a separate branch/minor cluster. The thirteen sequences had conserved copper A binding sites but copper B binding sites differed considerably in two new PPO sequences (AFJ79642 and ACR61398). A third conserved ‘Histidine-rich’ region has been identified at the ‘C’ terminus of the eggplant PPOs. In addition, all the seven new PPOs exhibited at least one glycosylated sequon in the mature PPO sequence. Identification of additional PPO genes will further help in functional and biological characterization of these PPOs.
