We previously reported that ceramide, the immediate product of sphingomyelin hydrolysis, increases in response to interleukin (IL)-1 beta and plays a role in modulating IL-1 beta-mediated prostaglandin E2 production and cyclooxygenase gene expression in human fibroblasts (Ballou, L. R., C. P. Chao, M. A. Holness, S. C. Barker, and R. Raghow. 1992. J. Biol. Chem. 267:20044-20050). Here we describe the effects of ceramide in another IL-1 beta-mediated process in these cells, the induction of IL-6 production. We found that submicromolar concentrations of C2-ceramide induced IL-6 gene expression and protein production as effectively as IL-1 beta. Both D-erythro-C2-ceramide (a cell-permeable analogue of natural ceramide) and D-threo-C2-ceramide were potent inducers of IL-6 production, while neither L isomer of ceramide was effective. Compared with IL-1 beta-induced IL-6 production, cells treated with ceramide or exogenous sphingomyelinase induced 82 and 50% of maximal IL-1 beta-induced IL-6 levels by 6 h, respectively; by 24 h all three treatments induced similar levels of IL- 6 production. Ceramide-induced IL-6 messenger RNA could be detected within 1 h of treatment and reached maximal levels by 24 h. These findings suggest that ceramide may play a role in the regulation of IL- 6 gene expression.
