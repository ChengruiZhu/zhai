 posterior midgut. Notch (N) signaling controls intestinal stem cell (ISC) differentiation in this tissue, while ISC proliferation is regulated by growth factor signaling pathways, including Insulin/IGF signaling (IIS). In this study, we explore the interaction between growth signals and N signaling in the control of ISC proliferation and differentiation. We show that TOR signaling, which promotes growth and can be activated by the IIS pathway, is maintained in ISCs in an inactive state by high expression of the TOR inhibitor TSC2. TSC2 expression shelters ISCs from nutritional cues, ensuring their long-term maintenance. In response to N pathway activation in enteroblasts (EB), the ISC daughter cells, TSC2 is transcriptionally repressed and TOR is activated. We demonstrate that this negative interaction between N and TSC2 is required and sufficient for differentiation of EBs into enterocytes (ECs), the absorptive cells of the epithelium. Our findings establish a critical role for TSC in ISC maintenance and provide a mechanism by which N promotes differentiation into the EC fate. The human homologue of TSC2 is an important tumor suppressor, and our study provides new insight into how its regulation controls regenerative processes.
