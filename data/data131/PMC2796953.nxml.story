In placental mammal females, Xist RNA is crucial for inactivation of one of the two X chromosomes in order to maintain proper X chromosome dosage. It is known that the conserved A region of Xist RNA, which contains eight or nine repeated elements, plays an essential role in this process, however, little is known about its structure and mechanism of action. By using chemical and enzymatic probes, as well as FRET experiments, we performed the first experimental analysis of the solution structure of the entire Xist A region. Both mouse and human A regions were found to form two long stem-loop structures each containing four repeats. In contrast to previous predictions, interactions take place both between repeats and between repeats and spacers. Affinity-purification of RNA-protein complexes formed by incubation of RNA in mouse ES cell nuclear extract, followed by mass spectrometry and antibody-based analyses of their protein contents, showed that the isolated 4-repeat structures from the A region can recruit components of the PRC2 complex that is needed for X chromosome inactivation. However, association of one component of this complex, Suz12, was more efficient when the entire A region was used.
