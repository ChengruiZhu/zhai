Cardiac output was lowered in STZ-induced diabetic rats. In addition, higher expressions of cardiac troponin I (cTnI) and phosphorylated GATA-4 were identified in these rats by Western blotting. The changes were reversed by treatment with insulin or phlorizin after correction of the blood sugar level. In H9c2 cells, ROS production owing to the high glucose concentration increased the expression of cTnI and GATA-4 phosphorylation. However, hyperglycemia failed to increase the expression of cTnI when GATA-4 was silenced by small interfering RNA (siRNA) in H9c2 cells. Otherwise, activation of ERK is known to be a signal for phosphorylation of serine105 in GATA-4 to increase the DNA binding ability of this transcription factor. Moreover, GSK3β could directly interact with GATA-4 to cause GATA-4 to be exported from the nucleus. GATA-4 nuclear translocation and GSK3β ser9 phosphorylation were both elevated by a high glucose concentration in H9c2 cells. These changes were reversed by tiron (ROS scavenger), PD98059 (MEK/ERK inhibitor), or siRNA of GATA-4. Cell contractility measurement also indicated that the high glucose concentration decreased the contractility of H9c2 cells, and this was reduced by siRNA of GATA-4.
