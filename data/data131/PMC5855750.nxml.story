The rapid development and application of nanotechnology to biological interfaces has impacted the bone implant field, allowing researchers to finely modulate the interface between biomaterials and recipient tissues. In the present study, oxidative anodization was exploited to generate two alumina surfaces with different pore diameters. The former displayed surface pores in the mean range of 16â€“30 nm, while in the latter pores varied from to 65 to 89 nm. The samples were characterized by Field Emission Scanning Electron Microscopy (FESEM) and Energy Dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) analysis prior to being tested with pre-osteoblastic MC3T3-E1 cells. In vitro cell response was studied in terms of early cell adhesion, viability, and morphology, including focal adhesion quantification. Both the alumina samples promoted higher cell adhesion and viability than the control condition represented by the standard culture dish plastic. Osteogenic differentiation was assessed through alkaline phosphatase activity and extracellular calcium deposition, and it was found that of the two nano-surfaces, one was more efficient than the other. By comparing for the first time two nano-porous alumina surfaces with different pore diameters, our data supported the role of nano-topography in inducing cell response. Modulating a simple aspect of surface texture may become an attractive route for guiding bone healing and regeneration around implantable metals.
