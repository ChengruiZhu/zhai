We have recently shown that salivary gland myoepithelial cells express podoplanin. Podoplanin indirectly binds the actin filament network which links classical cadherins. The study here is aimed to investigate the expression of podoplanin and cadherins on salivary gland myoepithelial cells and the changes in the aging cells using klotho-deficient (kl/kl) mice. The submandibular glands of kl/kl mouse lack granular ducts which express klotho in wild type mice, suggesting that klotho may be a gene responsible for granular duct development. Although aging resulted in growth suppression of myoepithelial cells because of the sparse distribution of the cells in kl/kl mouse salivary glands, the expression of podoplanin and E-cadherin was shown in aging myoepithelial cells. It is thought that podoplanin participates in the actin-E-cadherin networks which are maintained in aging myoepithelial cells. It was also shown that granular ducts were filled with P-cadherin, and that the P-cadherin amount was larger in the wild type mouse submandibular glands than in the sublingual and parotid glands of wild type mouse, and in the submandibular glands of kl/kl mouse. These findings suggest that the granular duct is an organ secreting soluble P-cadherin into the saliva.
