The aim of the present study was to investigate the association between O6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) gene expression levels, and DNA methylation status and histone modifications in laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma (LSCC). Chromatin immunoprecipitation, methylation-specific polymerase chain reaction (PCR), and reverse transcription-quantitative PCR were performed to analyze histone modifications, DNA methylation status and mRNA expression levels in the promoter region of the MGMT gene in laryngeal carcinoma HEp-2 cells, as well as in 50 paired healthy and LSCC tissue samples. The present study demonstrated that treatment of HEp-2 cells with 5-aza-2â€²-deoxycytidine (Aza), a DNA methyltransferase inhibitor, significantly upregulated MGMT mRNA expression levels, reduced MGMT DNA methylation, reduced MGMT histone H3 lysine 9 (H3K9) di-methylation, and increased MGMT histone H3 lysine 4 di-methylation without a significant change in H3K9 acetylation. Trichostatin A (TSA), a histone deacetylase inhibitor, marginally upregulated MGMT mRNA expression levels without affecting the DNA methylation status, or H3K9 or H3K4 di-methylation, however, TSA treatment caused a significant increase in H3K9 acetylation. Furthermore, Aza and TSA combination treatment produced a synergistic effect. In the LSCC samples, the rate of DNA methylation in the MGMT gene was 54%, compared with 24% in the healthy control group (P<0.05). Therefore, data from the present study indicates that MGMT may serve as a novel therapeutic target in the treatment of LSCC.
