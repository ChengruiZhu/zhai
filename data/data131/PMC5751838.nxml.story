Several genetic and epigenetic theories have been suggested to explain the intricacies of life and death. However, several questions remain unsettled regarding cellular death events, particularly of living tissue in the case of cancer patients, such as the fate and adaptation of cancer cells after biological death. It is possible that cancer cells can display the intent to communicate with the external environment after biological death by means of molecular, genetic, and epigenetic pathways. Whether these cancer cells contain special information in the form of coding that may help them survive beyond the biological death of cancer patients is unknown. To understand these queries in the cancer field, we hypothesize the epigenomic hard drive (EHD) as a cellular component to record and store global epigenetic events in cancerous and non-cancerous tissues of cancer patients. This mini-review presents the novel concept of EHD that is reinforced with the existing knowledge of genetic and epigenetic events in cancer. Further, we summarize the EHD understanding that may impart much potential and interest for basic and clinical scientists to unravel mechanisms of carcinogenesis, therapeutic markers, and differential drug responses.
