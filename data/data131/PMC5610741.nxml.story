Brinzolamide (BZ) is an intraocular pressure reducing agent with low bioavailability. The purpose of the present study was to overcome this issue by development of BZ containing nanoemulsions (NEs) as an ocular drug delivery system with desirable therapeutic efficacy. Brinzolamide NEs were prepared by the spontaneous emulsification method. Based on initial release studies, twelve formulations with the slowest release characteristics were subjected to further physicochemical investigations such as particle size, polydispersity index, pH, refractive index, osmolality and viscosity. The therapeutic efficacy of these formulations was assessed by measuring the intraocular pressure after instillation of the prepared NEs in normotensive albino rabbit eyes. Nanoemulsions with suitable physicochemical properties exhibited high formulation stability under different conditions. more over biological evaluations indicated that using lower drug concentrations in NE formulations (0.4%) had a similar or even better pharmacodynamic effect compared to the commercial suspension with a higher drug concentration (1%). Our findings suggest that NEs could be effectively used as carriers for enhancing the bioavailability of topically applied ophthalmic drugs.
