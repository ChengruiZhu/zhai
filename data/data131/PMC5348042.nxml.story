Super-resolution microscopy has suggested that the actin cytoskeleton structure differ between various neuronal subcompartments. To determine the possible implication of the differing actin cytoskeleton structure, we determined the stiffness of the plasma membrane of neuronal subcompartments using atomic force microscopy (AFM). We found that axons are almost ~6 fold stiffer than the soma and ~2 fold stiffer than dendrites. By using a particle-based model for the surface membrane skeleton of the axon that comprises actin rings connected with spring filaments to represent the axonal structure, we show that regions neighboring actin rings are stiffer than areas between these rings. In these in between sub-regions, the spectrin filaments determine stiffness. Our modeling also shows that because the spectrin filaments are under tension, the thermal jitter of the actin-associated ankyrin particles, connected to the middle area of spectrin filaments, is minimal. As a result, we propose that the sodium channels bound to ankyrin particles will maintain an ordered distribution along the axon. We also predict that laceration of the spectrin filaments due to injury will cause a permanent damage to the axon since spontaneous repair of the spectrin network is not possible as spectrin filaments are under entropic tension.
