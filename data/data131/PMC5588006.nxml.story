In our previous studies, a functionally unknown gene, family with sequence similarity 172, member A (FAM172A), was identified. High levels of FAM172A suppressed the cell cycle process, arresting HepG2 cells in G1/S and inhibiting cell proliferation. The present study aimed to confirm the expression levels of FAM172A and nucleotide-binding protein 1 (NUBP1) in colorectal cancer (CRC) tissues and normal colorectal tissues. The impact of FAM172A and NUBP1 on the prognosis of patients with CRC was also analyzed. Immunohistochemical staining for FAM172A and NUBP1 was performed on 180 cancerous tissues and 60 normal paraffin-embedded tissues from patients with CRC. In total, 85 and 83% of 180 patients revealed positive expression of FAM172A and NUBP1, respectively. FAM172A expression level was associated with Tumor-Node-Metastasis (TNM) staging (P<0.001), the levels of serum carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA; P=0.023) and carbohydrate antigen 19â€“9 (CA19-9; P=0.016), lymph node involvement (P=0.004), tissue type (P=0.016), Dukes' staging (P<0.001) and NUBP1 (P=0.026). Furthermore, the expression level of NUBP1 was also markedly associated with the levels of serum CEA (P=0.006) and CA19-9 (P=0.001), TNM staging (P<0.001), lymph node involvement (P=0.005), histological typing (P=0.024) and Dukes' stage (P<0.001). Results of the univariate analysis demonstrated that there was a negative correlation between the expression level of FAM172A and overall survival (OS) and relapse-free survival (RFS) (P=0.013 and P=0.012, respectively), and there was also a negative correlation between NUBP1 expression level and OS and RFS (P<0.001 and P<0.001, respectively). With regards to OS and RFS, multivariate analysis revealed that expression levels of FAM172A and NUBP1 and tumor stage may be independent prognostic factors Thus, the present study suggested that FAM172A and NUBP1 may be prognostic makers for CRC.
