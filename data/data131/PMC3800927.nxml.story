On the basis of observations and results found in chemical study and reported literature, the study came with the following conclusions. 1) The chincha patra rasa and Chincha pakwa phal rasa both contain Hordenine which has the antibacterial activity and stimulates the central nervous system providing relief from unquenchable thirst, muttering and delirium (indistinct and inaudible words unsteady gait) 2) Because of tannins, Chinchapatra ras and Chincha pakwaphal ras have astringent property, which counteract the toxic symptoms of Dhatur like dermatitis, rash and exfoliation of the skin. 3) Because of glycosides and tannins, chincha patra rasa and chincha pakwaphal have diuretic property which counteract the toxic symptoms of dhatura like urinary retention and inability to pass urine. 4) The tartaric acid present in chincha patra ras and chincha pakwaphal ras causes gastric irritation and thus induces vomiting. 5) Chincha patra ras and Chincha pakwa phal ras have flavonoids (Vit. P. and Citrin) which strengthens the blood vessels and lowers blood pressure and works as anti-inflammatoryagent. 6) The Chincha patra ras and Chincha pakwa phal ras have vit. ‘C’ which lead the blood circulation towards the heart which prevent the cardiac arrest produced in the Dhatura poisoning. 7) Chincha patra ras aqueous extract 1% and 10% has the pH of 5.91 and 5.45 and the pH of chincha pakwa phal ras aqueous extract of 1% and 10% has pH of 4.72 and 4.50. Both are acidic but the pH of Dhatura in aqueous extract of 1% is 8.19 and 8.00. Therefore, they neurtralize each other and reduce the toxic effect of dhatura. Similarly, the action of chincha rasa can be explained through the concepts of Ayurveda.
