The mammalian ureter is a simple tube with a specialized multi-layered epithelium, the urothelium, and a surrounding coat of fibroblasts and peristaltically active smooth muscle cells. Besides its important function in urinary drainage, the ureter represents a simple model system to study epithelial and mesenchymal tissue interactions in organ development. The differentiated cell types of the ureter coordinately arise from precursor cells of the distal ureteric bud and its surrounding mesenchyme. How their survival, growth and differentiation is regulated and coordinated within and between the epithelial and mesenchymal tissue compartments is largely unknown. Previous work identified Sonic hedgehog (SHH) as a crucial epithelial signal for growth and differentiation of the ureteric mesenchyme, but the entirety of the cellular functions and the molecular mediators of its mesenchymal signaling pathway have remained obscure. Here we showed that epithelial SHH acts in a paracrine fashion onto the ureteric mesenchyme to activate a FOXF1-BMP4 regulatory module that directs growth and differentiation of both ureteric tissue compartments. HH signaling additionally acts in outer mesenchymal cells as a survival factor. Thus, SHH is an epithelial signal that coordinates various cellular programs in early ureter development.
