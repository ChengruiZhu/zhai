Why do rats, people, and many other animals eat in bouts (meals) rather than continuously? How are they able to regulate not only total intake over a long period, but also within a meal? Is there a simple physiological explanation for these facts? We introduce a feedback model for eating regulation that can be readily interpreted in terms of existing neural data. We show by experiment and a theoretical model that eating in meals is regulated by a simple control system, like a house thermostat. In an experiment, we studied the meal patterns in rats after an interruption in food availability just as the animal tried to start a new meal. The results of this type of experiment cannot be explained by existing homeostatic approaches. We propose a simple model that combines long-term regulation (over months and years) by signals that reflect metabolic conditions, providing the set point for negative feedback, and short-term regulation (within a meal or a day) by feedback from the delayed gastrointestinal aftereffects of eating. The model shows that the dynamic process that governs regulation, meal patterns, and even adaptation to some complex operant food-reinforcement schedules is remarkably simple: ingested feeding inhibits eating, but the inhibitory effect is delayed.
