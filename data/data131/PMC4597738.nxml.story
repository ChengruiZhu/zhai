Patients with isolated anterior cruciate ligament rupture are included to study who donâ€™t have intra-and extra-articular additional pathology of the knee, without previously a history of operations of both knees. 2 groups were created. Group 1 Aperfix implant were used which can be able to perform non anatomical femoral tunnel and intra tunnel fixation with transtibial technique. In Group 2 Endobutton CL implant were used which can make fixation from outside the cortex with anatomic femoral tunnel in use of anteromedial portal techniques. 27 patients (average age 29,33, range 18 to 55 years) in group 1 and 27 patients (average age 27,51, range 16 to 45 years) in group 2 totally 54 patients were performed surgery. All patients were assessed using the IKDC (International knee documentation committee), Tegner Activity Scala and Lysholm II Functional Scores. Muscle strength measurements in both groups compared to intact knee was measured with an isokinetic dynamometer Biodex System 3 Pro. The location of the femoral tunnel aperture and tunnel widening were imaged with 3D reconstructive computed tomography. All measurements were performed using the same software application by the same radiologist.
