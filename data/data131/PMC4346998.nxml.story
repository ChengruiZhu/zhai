Vertigo is generally due to a benign disorder, but it is the most common symptom associated with misdiagnosis of stroke. In this pilot study, we preliminarily assessed the diagnostic performance of a structured bedside algorithm to differentiate central from non-central acute vertigo (AV). Adult patients presenting to a single Emergency Department with vertigo were evaluated with STANDING (SponTAneous Nystagmus, Direction, head Impulse test, standiNG) by one of five trained emergency physicians or evaluated ordinarily by the rest of the medical staff (control group). The gold standard was a complete audiologic evaluation by a clinicians who are experts in assessing dizzy patients and neuroimaging. Reliability, sensibility and specificity of STANDING were calculated. Moreover, to evaluate the potential clinical impact of STANDING, neuroimaging and hospitalisation rates were compared with control group. A total of 292 patients were included, and 48 (16.4%) had a diagnosis of central AV. Ninety-eight (33.4%) patients were evaluated with STANDING. The test had good interobserver agreement (k = 0.76), with very high sensitivity (100%, 95%CI 72.3-100%) and specificity (94.3%, 95%CI 90.7-94.3%). Furthermore, hospitalisation and neuroimaging test rates were lower in the STANDING than in the control group (27.6%
