The biomedical literature is an important source of knowledge on the function of genes and on the mechanisms by which these genes regulate cellular processes. Several text mining approaches have been developed to leverage this rich source of information by automatically extracting associations between concepts such as genes, diseases and drugs from a large body of text. Here, we describe a new method that extracts novel, not yet recognized associations between genes, diseases, drugs and cellular processes from the biomedical literature. Our method is built on the assumption that even if two concepts do not have a direct connection in literature, they may be functionally related if they are both connected to an overlapping set of concepts. Using this approach we predicted several novel connections between genes, diseases, drugs and pathways. Our results imply that our method is able to predict novel relationships from literature and, most importantly, that these newly identified relationships are biologically relevant. Our method can aid the drug discovery process where it can be used to find novel drug targets, increase insight in mode of action of a drug or find novel applications for known drugs.
