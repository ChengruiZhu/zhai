Elucidation of the molecular mechanisms by which 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) induces apoptosis is required in order to understand the resistance of colorectal cancer (CRC) cells to 5-FU. In the current study, 5-FU-induced apoptosis was assessed using the propidium iodide method. Involvement of protein kinase C (PKC) was assessed by evaluating the extent of their activation in CRC, following treatment with 5-FU, using biochemical inhibitors and western blot analysis. The results revealed that 5-FU induces varying degrees of apoptosis in CRC cells; HCT116 cells were identified to be the most sensitive cells and SW480 were the least sensitive. In addition, 5-FU-induced apoptosis was caspase-dependent as it appeared to be initiated by caspase-9. Furthermore, PKCɛ was marginally expressed in CRC cells and no changes were observed in the levels of cleavage or phosphorylation following treatment with 5-FU. The treatment of HCT116 cells with 5-FU increased the expression, phosphorylation and cleavage of PKCδ. The inhibition of PKCδ was found to significantly inhibit 5-FU-induced apoptosis. These results indicated that 5-FU induces apoptosis in CRC by the activation of PKCδ and caspase-9. In addition, the levels of PKCδ activation may determine the sensitivity of CRC to 5-FU.
