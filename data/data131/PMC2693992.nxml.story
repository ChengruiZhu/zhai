The persistence and costs of carbonic anhydrase inhibitors + prostaglandin analogues (CAIs + PGAs) vs alpha-2 adrenergic agonists + prostaglandin analogues (alpha-2 agonists + PGAs) were compared, based on The United Kingdom General Practitioner Research Database. Patients with a diagnosis of ocular hypertension, glaucoma, or treated for this, were selected. Selected patients were prescribed CAIs + PGAs or alpha-2 agonists + PGAs. Treatment failure was defined as a prescription change (adding, removing, or replacing glaucoma treatment, or initiating laser or surgery). Times to treatment failure were compared with a Cox model adjusted by a propensity score. Mean patient age was 69.0 years and 47.6% were males. Treatment failure at 1 year was experienced by 58.8% receiving CAIs + PGAs and 66.0% of patients receiving alpha-2 agonists + PGAs (p < 0.001). The hazard ratio for failure was 0.82 (p < 0.001) in favor of CAIs + PGAs after adjusting on age, gender, comorbidities, and duration of follow-up. Adjusted annual costs of glaucoma management did not differ significantly between treatments, £440.63 with alpha-2 agonists + PGAs and £413.37 with CAIs + PGAs. CAIs + PGAs therapies appear more persistent than alpha-2 agonist + PGA in everyday clinical practice, at a similar cost.
