Proteins in their native state are compact structures consisting of long chains of amino-acid residues. As such, a protein should be likely to get entangled or tie into a complex knot. However, researchers have found only a handful of complex knots in native proteins. Lua and Grosberg make what they believe to be the first quantitative study of the statistics of knots in proteins. Although they have found some rather complex knots, including one knot with five crossings in a modest size protein of only 229 amino acids (ubiquitin hydrolase), comparison of the knot abundance in proteins and in compact random strings on a lattice indicates extreme nonrandomness of protein conformations in this respect. They also study the statistics of the geometrical behaviour of parts of protein chains. They find that these parts, on the scale of about 20–30 residues, have a strong nonrandom tendency to crumple back on themselves, and that the segregration of the parts on this scale is also far in excess of random, while on a larger scale the geometry of conformations is statistically close to random. These geometrical features are consistent with the statistical rarity of knots. From these, the authors conclude that the “protein universe” avoids knots.
