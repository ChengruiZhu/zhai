We analyzed the expression of the steroid and xenobiotic receptor (SXR) in human uterine sarcomas and evaluated its clinical significance. Forty-seven cases with archival specimens were examined for SXR expression using immunohistochemistry. All cases were scored using a semi-quantitative histological scoring (HSCORE) method. Specimens with a HSCORE >40 were regarded as SXR-positive. Various clinicopathological variables, including the expression status of estrogen receptor (ER)-Î±, progesterone receptor (PR) and Ki67 (MIB-1) were examined. The mean SXR HSCOREs of carcinosarcoma (CS) and leiomyosarcoma (LMS) were 9.13 and 23.6, respectively, and SXR-positive rates were 3 out of 24 (12.5%) and 4 out of 17 (23.5%), respectively. SXR was not detected in endometrial stromal sarcoma (ESS). In CS cases, significant differences were detected between the expression of SXR and age and disease stages. There was no significant correlation between SXR-positive status and either disease-free survival or overall survival. Our results support an association between SXR and malignant behavior. Our results show that overexpression of SXR may represent a useful marker to identify patients with advanced-stage CS. In addition, our results showed that SXR may aid in the diagnosis of uterine sarcomas.
