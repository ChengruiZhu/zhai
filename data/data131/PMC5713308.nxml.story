To increase the overall survival rate and obtain a better prognosis for oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) patients, the detection of more effective and reliable tumor prognostic markers is needed. This study is focused on the analysis of correlation between the clinicopathological features of OSCCs and the immunohistochemical (IHC) expression patterns of MIDKINE (MK) and NANOG. Sixty-two primary OSCC patients were selected and their pretreatment biopsy specimens were immunohistochemically analyzed for the MK and NANOG proteins. The IHC expression patterns, clinicopathological features, and overall survival rates were assessed to identify any correlations. MK and NANOG showed significantly similar IHC expression patterns: both demonstrated enhanced expression in histologically high-grade and clinically late-stage OSCCs. Weak or negative expression of MK and NANOG was correlated with negative neck node metastasis. Clinicopathologically, late tumor stage, neck node metastasis, high-grade tumor, and palliative treatment groups showed significantly lower overall survival rates. The enhanced expression of MK and NANOG was associated with lower overall survival rates. In particular, enhanced co-detection of MK and NANOG showed significant correlation with poor prognosis. In conclusion, enhanced IHC expression patterns of MK and NANOG in OSCC patients was significantly associated with lower overall survival rates and unfavorable clinicopathological features. These results demonstrate that analysis of IHC expression patterns of MK and NANOG in pretreatment biopsy specimens during the work-up period can provide a more definitive prognosis prediction for each OSCC patient that can help clinicians to develop a more precise individual treatment modality.
