Both genistein and bLap produced dose-dependent growth inhibition and treatment-induced apoptosis in PC3. Treatment with caspase 3 inhibitor, DEVD-fmk before exposure to genistein, significantly inhibited caspase 3 expression and treatment-induced apoptosis; implicating CPP32 as the main target in genistein-induced apoptosis in PC3. Contrary to this observation, inhibition of CPP32 did not significantly influence bLap-induced apoptosis; implying that the major target of bLap-induced apoptosis may not be the caspase. Treatment with NQO1 inhibitor, dicoumarol (50 μM), prior to exposure of PC3 to bLap led to significant decrease in bLap toxicity concurrent with significant decrease in treatment-induced apoptosis; thus implicating NQO1 as the major target in β-lapachone-induced apoptosis in PC3. In addition, the data demonstrated that NQO1 is the major target in bLap-genistein (combination)-induced apoptosis. On the contrary, blocking NQO1 activity did not significantly affect genistein-induced apoptosis; implying that NQO1 pathway may not be the main target for genistein-induced apoptosis in PC3 cells. Furthermore, blocking NQO1 and CPP32 did not confer 100% protection against genistein-induced or bLap-induced apoptosis.
