Non-Hodgkin lymphoma of Waldeyer’s ring constitutes a small percentage of cases of palatine tonsil malignancies and its precise etiology remains unknown. RCAS1 (receptor cancer-binding antigen expressed on SiSo cells) has been demonstrated to be associated with poor prognosis, the development of lymph node metastases and participation in tumor microenvironment remodeling. Our aim is to analyze the potential role of RCAS1 expression in the tumor and tumor microenvironment in the development of early-stage palatine tonsil B-cell lymphomas. We selected 20 patients and analyzed tissue samples from the lymphoma and tumor microenvironment of each patient and from a reference group of 20 patients with chronic tonsillitis. The presence of RCAS1 protein immunoreactivity was demonstrated in 65 % of the examined tissue samples of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma and in 25 % of the analyzed stromata in which it was exhibited by CD68-positive cells identified as macrophages and dispersed throughout the stroma. RCAS1 immunoreactivity in the lymphoma tissue samples remained at a level comparable with that of the reference and was significantly higher in these samples than in those from the stroma. Chronic inflammation of the palatine tonsils thus results in intensive infiltration by various types of immune system cells and in excessive RCAS1 immunoreactivity, both of which confirm the important regulatory role of RCAS1 in the immune response in the mucosa-associated lymphatic tissue of Waldeyer’s ring. RCAS1 seems to be involved in creating tumor-induced inflammation in the tumor and its microenvironment.
