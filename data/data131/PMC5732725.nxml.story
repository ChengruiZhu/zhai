 and in clinics, but how did miR-129 and Notch signaling function in breast cancer stem-like cells (BrCSCs) were unclear yet. Through using sphere forming assay and FACS sorting, we found that miR-129 decreased the proportion of stem-like cells in breast cancer cells. Results further indicated that miR-129 degraded the Estrogen Receptor 1 (ESR1) mRNA through a post-translational manner and contributed to the decline of stem-like cells number, preventing tumor regeneration. Cyclin d1 and DICER 1 were proved to promote Let-7 maturation, and in present study, we proved that miR-129 exhibited inhibition on ESR1 and halted the cyclin d1/DICER 1 sustaining of Let-7, which consequently released the Let-7 degradation of NUMB. The restoration of suppressive NUMB by upregulating miR-129 resulted in NOTCH signaling inhibition. In conclusion, we demonstrated the negative regulation of miR-129 on NOTCH signaling activation in BrCSCsâ€™ renewal, which was achieved via continuous suppression on cyclin d1/DICER1 sustaining of Let-7 level, and eventually rescued the targeted inhibition of NUMB. The miR-129/ESR1 signaling played pivotal role in controlling DICER1/Let-7/NOTCH cascade via cyclin d1, revealing the novel mechanism of dual Let-7 in non-coding genes network.
