In the lateral ocellus of the barnacle, we have tested the hypothesis that the transient increase of oxygen consumption (delta QO2) induced by light results from an increase in the rate of Na+ pumping. With a Na(+)-sensitive microelectrode, we measured the intracellular concentration of Na+ (Nai) in the photoreceptor cells. Nai was 17.6 +/- 1.2 mM (SE; n = 18) in darkness and it increased transiently by 10-20 mM after an 80-ms flash of intense light. The increase of Nai recovered in about the same time as the delta QO2, and the Na+/O2 ratio was 19.2 +/- 3.8 (SE; n = 6). Removing Na+ from the bath caused the delta QO2 to decrease by 79 +/- 3% (SE; n = 5). Exposure to 25 microM ouabain inhibited Na+ pumping and abolished the delta QO2. Removal of K+ from the bathing solution inhibited Na+ pumping in darkness, but mostly shortened the duration of the delta QO2; with a K(+)-sensitive microelectrode, we measured pericellular [K+] and found that it increased after the flash for about the same time as the delta QO2. Increasing Na+ pumping in darkness by reintroducing K+ in the bath or by injecting Na+ into one of the photoreceptor cells induced a delta QO2. Finally, intracellular injection of adenosine diphosphate and inorganic phosphate (ADP + Pi), the metabolic products of ATP splitting by the Na+ pump, also induced a delta QO2 in darkness. We conclude that all the results obtained are consistent with the formulated hypothesis.
