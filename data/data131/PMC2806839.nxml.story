Cells exposed to 40µM Resveratrol rapidly abolished serine473 phosphorylation of Akt and significantly reduced its kinase activity. Inactivation of Akt pathway by Resveratrol subsequently blocked serine9 phosphorylation of Gsk3β. Active non-phosphorylated Gsk3β rendered HSF1 transcriptionally inactive and reduced Hsp70 production. Blocking PI3K/Akt activity also demonstrated similar effects on Hsp70 comparable to Resveratrol. Inactivation of Gsk3β activity by inhibitors SB261763 or LiCl upregulated Hsp70. Resveratrol significantly modulated ERK1/2 activity as evident from hyper phosphorylation at T302/Y304 residues and simultaneous upregulation in kinase activity. Blocking ERK1/2 activation resulted in induction of Hsp70. Therefore, increase in ERK1/2 activity by Resveratrol provided another negative influence on Hsp70 levels through negative regulation of HSF1 activity. 17-allylamino-17-demethoxygeldanamycin (17AAG), a drug that inhibits Hsp90 chaperone and degrades its client protein Akt concomitantly elevated Hsp70 levels by promoting nuclear translocation of HSF1 from the cytosol. This effect is predominantly due to inhibition of both Akt and ERK1/2 activation by 17AAG. Simultaneously treating K562 with Resveratrol and 17AAG maintained phosho-ERK1/2 levels close to untreated controls demonstrating their opposite effects on ERK1/2 pathway. Resveratrol was found not to interfere with Bcr-Abl activation in K562 cells.
