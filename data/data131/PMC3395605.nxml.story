Histone chaperones facilitate the assembly and disassembly of nucleosome by interacting with the corresponding histones or histone variants. As the biomolecules in nucleosome are highly charged, electrostatic interactions are particularly important in these processes. The experiments have explored that the histone chaperon Chz1 as an intrinsically disordered protein (IDP) can fold by binding to its histone variants H2A.Z-H2B. Here, we developed a molecular simulation program that treated electrostatic interactions with Debye-HÃ¼ckel model to study the mechanism of the association. We found that the inter-chain electrostatic interactions facilitate the coupled folding and binding transitions, consistent with the kinetic experiments and microscopic structural perspectives. Furthermore, we show that the intra-chain electrostatic interactions collapse Chz1 and slow the binding rate. The collapsed structure in IDPs caused by intra-chain electrostatic interactions has been widely found in experiments and the effect in binding is well studied in our work. Our theoretical approach shed new light on the role of electrostatics on inter-chain and intra-chain interactions for IDPs' binding and is applicable to the binding/folding of other IDPs to their targets.
