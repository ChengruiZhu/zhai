A 54-year-old female patient reported that a characteristic of her family was ‘fat legs’ with postural edema since adolescence. Over the years the patient had been gaining weight with an increase in fatty tissue in the legs and arms. At the age of 24 years she started taking oral contraceptives and noted worse swelling and pain in the lower limbs. She was advised to suspend the use of the contraceptives and to start using a transdermal lymphatic system drug and physical exercise which partially improved the symptoms. Three years ago she noted that the swelling was increasing without improvement and sought a physician who raised the hypothesis of lymphedema and referred her to a specialized center. Lipedema and lymphedema was diagnosed in the physical examination. A 3-day intensive treatment program (8 h daily) was started for lymphedema which included manual and mechanical lymph drainage associated with short-strech (<50 mm Hg) compression stockings custom made using a cotton-polyester fabric. Volumetry and perimetry were performed before starting and after the treatment and the legs were photographed. Volumetric and perimetric reductions were obtained suggesting the involvement of regional cutaneous lymphostasis in this disease.
