Natriuretic peptide receptor 3 (NPR3) is a clearance receptor by binding and internalizing natriuretic peptides (NPs) for ultimate degradation. Patients with cardiac failure show elevated NPs. NPs are linked to poor long-term survival because of their apoptotic effects. However, the underling mechanisms have not been identified yet. Here we report the role of NPR3 in anti-apoptosis via the breast cancer type 1 susceptibility protein (BRCA1) and tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α ). To demonstrate a role for NPR3 in apoptosis, stable H9C2 cardiomyocyte cell lines using shRNA to knockdown NPR3 were generated. The activities of caspase-3, 8, and 9 were significantly increased in NPR3 knockdown H9C2 cardiomyocytes. Knockdown of NPR3 increased the expression of BRCA1. Also NPR3 knockdown remarkably increased the activity of cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB), a positive regulatory element for BRCA1 expression. BRCA1 showed dispersed nuclear localization in non-cardiomyocytes while predominantly cytoplasmic localization in H9C2 cells. Meanwhile, NPR3 knockdown significantly increased TNF-α gene expression. These data show that NPR3 knockdown in H9C2 cells triggered both extrinsic and intrinsic apoptotic pathways. NPR3 protects cardiomyocytes from apoptosis through inhibition of cytosolic BRCA1 and TNF-α, which are regulators of apoptosis. Our studies demonstrate anti-apoptosis role of NPR3 in protecting cardiomyocytes and establish the first molecular link between NP system and programmed cell death.
