Emerging cardiovascular biomarkers, such as speckle tracking echocardiography (STE) and aortic pulse wave velocity (aPWV), have recently demonstrated the presence of subclinical left ventricular dysfunction and arterial stiffening in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) and no previous cardiovascular history. However, limited information exists on the prognostic impact of these biomarkers. We aimed to investigate whether STE and aPWV predict major adverse cardiac events (MACE) in this patient population. In this cohort study we prospectively analysed 106 CKD patients with no overt cardiovascular disease (CVD) and normal left ventricular ejection fraction. Cardiac deformation was measured using STE while aPWV was measured using arterial tonometry. The primary end-point was the composite of all-cause mortality, acute coronary syndrome, stable angina requiring revascularization (either using percutaneous coronary intervention or coronary artery bypass surgery), hospitalization for heart failure and stroke. Over a median follow up period of 49 months (interquartile range 11–63 months), 26 patients (24.5%) reached the primary endpoint. In a multivariable Cox hazards model, global longitudinal strain (GLS) (HR 1.12, 95% CI 1.02–1.29, p = 0.041) and aPWV (HR 1.31, 95% CI 1.05–1.41, p = 0.021) were significant, independent predictors of MACE. GLS and aPWV independently predict MACE in CKD patients with normal EF and no clinically overt CVD.
