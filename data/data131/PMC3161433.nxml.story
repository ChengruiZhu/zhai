Podocytes are highly specialized epithelial cells that form part of the filtration barrier in the kidney, and their loss reflects a malfunction in glomerular filtration, which is usually associated with the progression of the disease. Glomerulonephritis is a serious complication that develops in about 50% of the lupus patients and is characterized by proteinuria arising from direct or indirect podocyte injury. To assess the possible role of podocytes in the pathogenesis of lupus nephritis (LN). Urinary and glomerular podocytes were detected in the kidney biopsies of patients (n = 17) with lupus nephritis, and from control biopsies obtained during autopsies. The WT-1 protein was used as a podocyte marker. The cumulative excretion of urinary podocytes was detected in the urinary sediments of LN patients and normal healthy controls, and the specimens were analyzed by immunohistochemistry, immunofluorescence, and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The apoptotic index was determined by terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick end labeling. Gross proteinuria in lupus patients was determined via 24-hour urine samples, and the results were analyzed by Student t test. Biopsy specimens from 17 patients with class-III or IV LN had lower levels of glomerular WT-1 expression than the levels found in normal kidneys (
