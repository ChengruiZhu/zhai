During asymmetric cell division, spindle positioning is critical for ensuring the unequal inheritance of polarity factors. In budding yeast, the constriction between mother cell and bud, the bud neck, determines the cleavage plane. Cytoskeletal proteins called septins form a ring at the bud neck that serves as scaffold for the recruitment of proteins required for cytokinesis. The septin ring also interacts with cytoplasmic microtubules to orient the spindle along the motherâ€“bud axis and to ensure that each daughter cell inherits one full set of chromosomes. A surveillance device called Spindle Position Checkpoint (SPOC) oversees this process and delays mitotic exit and cytokinesis until the spindle is properly oriented along the division axis, thus ensuring genome stability. Feedback mechanisms responding to spindle mispositioning likely exist also in higher eukaryotes. In this manuscript, we show that two budding yeast ubiquitin ligases are involved in the regulation of septin dynamics and the SPOC by promoting the bud neck localization of the Elm1 protein kinase, which in turn participates in both processes. Altogether our data indicate that bud neck integrity and septins are important for SPOC signalling and that the two processes are controlled by a common regulatory module.
