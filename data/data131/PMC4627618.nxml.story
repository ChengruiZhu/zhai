Median age was 37 (range 13–58 years). Location was in an extremity in 29 patients (88 %). Post-operative chemotherapy was given in 22 (67 %) patients. Follow-up data were available for all patients, with a median observation time of 115 months (range 4–322 months). After histological revision, areas of high-grade (grade 3) osteosarcoma accounting for less than 50 % of the tumor were found in 20 (61 %) patients, whereas the majority of the tumor was composed of a high-grade (grade 3) component in 13 (39 %) patients. In the 20 cases of low-grade osteosarcoma with high-grade foci (grade 3) in less than 50 % of the tumor, 9 patients did not receive adjuvant chemotherapy; only one of them died, of unrelated causes. In the adjuvant chemotherapy group (11 out of 20 patients), one patient developed multiple lung metastases and died of disease 39 months after the first diagnosis. In the other 13 cases of low-grade osteosarcoma with high-grade foci (grade 3) in more than 50 % of the tumor, 12 patients received adjuvant chemotherapy: 2 had recurrence, 4 developed multiple lung metastases and 3 died of disease. The only patient who did not receive chemotherapy is alive without disease 232 months after complete surgical remission.
