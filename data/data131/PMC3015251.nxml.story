From December 1990 through October 1997, laparoscopic cholecystectomy was attempted in 114 patients, ranging in age from 6 months to 23 years (mean 12.3 years). Hemolysis from sickle cell disease was the predominant etiology, occurring in 83 patients (73%). Ninety patients (80%) presented with cholelithiasis, 21 (18.2%) with choledocholithiasis, and only two (1.8%) with acute cholecystitis. Only 3 patients (2.6%) required conversion to open cholecystectomy: one due to massive hepatomegaly, one due to a very short cystic duct and the third due to the patient's small size (6 months old) early in our series. One patient underwent reexploration for intra-abdominal bleeding following laparoscopic cholecystectomy, and no patient suffered a bile duct injury or required management of a biloma. Postoperative length of stay average was 2.5 days, with 80% of patients discharged within 48 hours. Significant postoperative complications included a retained common bile duct stone noted four months postoperatively (which was successfully removed endoscopically) and one trocar site hernia in a child with cystic fibrosis. Three children expired (2.6%), but their deaths were not related to their biliary tract surgery.
