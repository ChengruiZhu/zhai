To carry out specific biochemical reactions, proteins must adopt precise three-dimensional conformations. During the folding of a protein, the protein picks out the right conformation out of billions of other conformations. It is not yet possible to do this computationally. Picking out the native conformation using physics-based atomically detailed models, sampled by molecular dynamics, is presently beyond the reach of computer methods. How can we speed up computational protein-structure prediction? One idea is that proteins start folding at specific parts of a chain that kink up early in the folding process. If we can identify these kinks, we should be able to speed up protein-structure prediction. Previous studies have identified likely kinks through bioinformatic analysis of existing protein structures. The goal of the authors here is to identify these putative folding initiation sites with a physical model instead. In this study, Ho and Dill show that, by chopping a protein chain into peptide pieces, then simulating the pieces in molecular dynamics, they can identify those peptide fragments that have conformational biases. These peptides identify the kinks in the protein chain.
