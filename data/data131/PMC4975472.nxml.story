In the lungs, the airway surface liquid protects the airway epithelium from inhaled pathogens and particulates. It is well known that failure to properly clear mucus from the airways leads to chronic, even fatal, lung infections. To date, there is no validated constitutive model capable of recapitulating mucus rheology under diverse, physiological stress and deformation conditions. This gap has hindered studies into the causal relationship between mucus rheology and mucociliary clearance. Our modeling-experimental approach fulfills several purposes: to implement linear and nonlinear constitutive modeling of mucus from micro- and macro-rheology, to test constitutive modeling in an independent experimental system, to build a coarse-grained model of the PCL-mucus boundary condition, to measure and understand modifications in mucociliary transport during and after deposition of a controlled drug concentration, to measure and simulate both the flow and stress fields throughout the mucus layer, and to measure and simulate how the advection profiles in the culture couple with diffusion of particulates landing on the air-mucus interface. These results lay the groundwork for extension of the code to three dimensions and more realistic metachronal wave boundary conditions, both in cell cultures and in airways.
