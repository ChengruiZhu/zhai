The effect of extracellular pH (pHo) on the duration of calcium- dependent chloride currents (ICl(Ca] was studied in voltage clamped AtT- 20 pituitary cells. ICl(Ca) was activated by Ca2+ influx through plasma membrane Ca2+ channels, which were opened by step depolarization to voltages between -20 and +60 mV. Increasing pHo from 7.3 to 8.0 reversibly prolonged ICl(Ca) tail currents in perforated patch recordings from cells bathed in both Na(+)-containing and Na(+)-free solutions. This prolongation was prevented in standard whole cell recordings when the pipette solution contained 0.5 mM EGTA. The effects of raised pHo were not due to alteration of intracellular pH, since tail current prolongation still occurred when intracellular pH was buffered at 7.3 with 80 mM HEPES. The prolongation of ICl(Ca) at pHo 8 could not be accounted for by a direct action on Ca2+ channels, since tail currents were prolonged when pHo was changed rapidly during the tail current, after all Ca2+ channels were closed. The effects of increasing pHo on ICl(Ca) also could not be explained by a direct action on Cl- channels, since changing to pHo 8 did not prolong Cl- tail currents when intracellular Ca2+ concentration [( Ca2+]i) was fixed by EGTA in whole cell recordings. Raising pHo did, however, prolong depolarization-evoked [Ca2+]i transients, measured directly with the Ca2+ indicator dye, fura-2. Taken together, these data demonstrate the presence of a Na(+)-independent, pHo-sensitive mechanism for reduction of [Ca2+]i after influx through Ca2+ channels. This mechanism is associated with the plasma membrane, and is active on a time scale that is relevant to the duration of single action potentials in these cells. We suggest that this mechanism is the plasma membrane Ca2+ ATPase.
