Semistructured, qualitative telephone interviews were conducted with 17 partnered women (aged 43 to 75 years) purposively selected from the Translational Research Investigating Underlying Disparities in Acute Myocardial Infarction Patients’ Health Status Registry to deepen knowledge of recovery of female sexual function following an acute myocardial infarction (MI) and to improve sexual outcomes in women. Sixteen women had a monogamous relationship with a male spouse; 1 had a long‐term female partner. Most women resumed sexual activity within 4 weeks of their MI. Sexual problems and concerns were prevalent, including patient and/or partner fear of “causing another heart attack.” Few women received counseling about sexual concerns or the safety of returning to sex. Most women who discussed sex with a physician initiated the discussion themselves. Inquiry about strategies to improve sexual outcomes elicited key themes: need for privacy, patient‐centeredness, and information about the timing and safe resumption of sexual activity. In addition, respondents felt that counseling should be initiated by the treating cardiologist, who “knows whether your heart is safe,” and then reinforced by the care team throughout the rehabilitation period.
