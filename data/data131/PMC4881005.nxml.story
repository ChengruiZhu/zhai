Patients were diagnosed at a median of 53 years old, long after disease onset at 45. Most (55.3 %) were originally from the southernmost regions, Kyushu and Okinawa. The main initial symptoms were difficulty walking (81.9 %), urinary dysfunction (38.5 %), and lower limb sensory disturbances (13.9 %). Many patients reported frequent leg numbness and leg pain, and the vast majority required medical intervention for urinary symptoms and constipation. A median of 8 years elapsed from the onset of motor symptoms to Osame Motor Disability Score (OMDS) 5 (requiring unilateral support), 12.5 years to OMDS 6 (requiring bilateral support), and 18 years to OMDS 9 (unable to walk). Health Assessment Questionnaire - Disability Index (HAQ-DI) tasks related to mobility, as opposed to hand motions, were very difficult for HAM/TSP patients and well-correlated with OMDS. Scores on the MOS 36-Item Short-Form Health Survey (SF-36) indicated that physical functioning was severely impaired in HAM/TSP patients. Patients with a history of blood transfusion (19.1 %) were older and suffered from more severe disability as indicated by their high HAQ-DI scores. Patients with a family history of HAM/TSP (8.4 %) were younger and had relatively mild symptoms given their long disease durations; many (15.6 %) also had a relative with ATLL.
