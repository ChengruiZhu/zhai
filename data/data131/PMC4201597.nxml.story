Solar radiation is an important risk factor for skin cancer, the incidence of which is increasing, especially in the fair-skinned populations of the world. While the ultraviolet (UV)B component has direct DNA damaging ability, UVA-induced effects are currently mainly attributed to the production of reactive oxygen species. In our recent study, we compared the effects of UVA and UVB radiation on human keratinocytes and found that UVA-induced plasma membrane damage was rapidly repaired by lysosomal exocytosis, which was detected based on the expression of lysosomal membrane associated protein-1 (LAMP-1) on the plasma membrane of non-permeabilized cells. Later, the keratinocytes died through caspase-8 mediated apoptosis. In contrast, the plasma membranes of keratinocytes exposed to UVB showed no LAMP-1 expression, and, although the cells died by apoptosis, no initial caspase-8 activity was detected. We have also demonstrated the occurrence of UVA-induced lysosomal exocytosis in reconstructed skin and shown the relocation of lysosomes from the center of cells to the vicinity of the plasma membrane. Thus, we suggest that lysosomal exocytosis also occurs in keratinocytes covered by the stratum corneum following exposure to UVA. Our findings provide new insight into the mechanism of UVA-induced skin damage.
