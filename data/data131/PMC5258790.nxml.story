A matrix removal procedure with ion-exchange resin prior to analysis for 18 fluorinated benzoic acids (FBAs) tracers in saline (>25% salt) reservoir water was optimized. The elimination of >98% of salt and the simultaneous matrix sample cleanup allowed the direct analysis using the supernatant by liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). This resulted in a gain in detection limits for most of the tracers in comparison with the reference method (direct analysis after minimum required dilution). The limits of detection (LODs) were in the range of 0.01–0.15 ng/ml and compared to other studies the developed method provided comparable limits of detection and advantage of simplified and shorter sample preparation. The presented method offers a considerable gain in simplicity and analysis time. Recoveries for all the tracers reached 80–100%, except for 2-FBA and 2,6-dFBA for which they were ca. 60%. The low recoveries were corrected by the use of five isotopically labeled internal standards. The method was validated by the analysis of spiked samples and by an independent comparison of the results with those obtained by solid-phase extraction LC-MS/MS method.
