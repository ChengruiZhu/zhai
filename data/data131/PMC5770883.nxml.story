The level of Sirt2 protein is reduced in oocytes from aged mice, while exogenous expression of Sirt2 could ameliorate the maternal age‐associated meiotic defects. To date, the underlying mechanism remains unclear. Here, we confirmed that specific depletion of Sirt2 disrupts maturational progression and spindle/chromosome organization in mouse oocytes, with compromised kinetochore–microtubule attachments. Candidate screening revealed that acetylation state of lysine 243 on BubR1 (BubR1‐K243, an integral part of the spindle assembly checkpoint complex) functions during oocyte meiosis, and acetylation‐mimetic mutant BubR1‐K243Q results in the very similar phenotypes as Sirt2‐knockdown oocytes. Furthermore, we found that nonacetylatable‐mimetic mutant BubR1‐K243R partly prevents the meiotic deficits in oocytes depleted of Sirt2. Importantly, BubR1‐K243R overexpression in oocytes derived from aged mice markedly suppresses spindle/chromosome anomalies and thereupon lowers the incidence of aneuploid eggs. In sum, our data suggest that Sirt2‐dependent BubR1 deacetylation involves in the regulation of meiotic apparatus in normal oocytes and mediates the effects of advanced maternal age on oocyte quality.
