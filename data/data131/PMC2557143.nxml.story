Amyloid-like fibrils are insoluble proteinaceous fibrillar aggregates with a characteristic structure (the cross-Î² core) that form and deposit in more than 40 pathological conditions in humans. These include Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, type II diabetes, and the spongiform encephalopathies. A number of proteins not involved in any disease can also form amyloid-like fibrils in vitro, suggesting that amyloid fibril formation is an intrinsic property of proteins in general. Recent efforts in understanding the physico-chemical grounds of amyloid fibril formation has led to the development of several algorithms, capable of predicting a number of aggregation-related parameters of a protein directly from its amino acid sequence. In order to study the predicted aggregation behavior of the human proteome, we have run one of these algorithms on the 34,180 human protein sequences. Our results demonstrate that molecular evolution has acted on protein sequences to finely modulate their aggregation propensities, depending on different parameters related to their in vivo environment. Together with cellular control mechanisms, this natural selection protects proteins from aggregation during their lifetime.
