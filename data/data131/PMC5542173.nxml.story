Previous epidemiological research suggests polymorphisms in long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) H19 are associated with an increased risk of cancer, but the results are inconsistent. We therefore conducted a meta-analysis to more accurately determine the association between lncRNA H19 polymorphisms and cancer risk. The PubMed, Embase, and Science Citation Index online databases were searched and 11 relevant studies involving a total of 33,209 participants were identified. Odds ratios (ORs) and corresponding 95% confidence interval (CIs) from these studies were used to detect associations between H19 polymorphisms and cancer risk using five genetic models. The pooled result suggested that the rs2839698 G>A polymorphism was associated with digestive cancer risk in all five models. Moreover, a protective effect against cancer development was observed for the T allele variant of the rs2107425 C>T polymorphism, especially in Caucasian patient populations. No significant associations were found between lncRNA H19 rs217727 G>A polymorphism and cancer risk. In summary, the rs2839698 G>A and rs2107425 C>T polymorphisms in lncRNA H19 may therefore play opposing roles during cancer development, and their effects may vary depending on cancer type and patient ethnicity.
