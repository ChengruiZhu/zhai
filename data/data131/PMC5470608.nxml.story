We hypothesized that different 8-MOP incubation times and an additional 8-MOP removal step could influence the apoptosis kinetics of leukocytes in general and in particular could lead to different apoptotic levels in the leukocyte subpopulations. After 8-MOP/UVA treatment of human leukocytes, cells were cultured and the percentage of annexin V positive cells from several leukocyte subpopulations was determined. Only regulatory T cells (Tregs) were relatively resistant to 8-MOP/UVA induced apoptosis. When cells were incubated for 30 minutes with 8-MOP prior to UVA exposure, higher percentages of annexin V positive cells were detected on day 1 and day 2 after treatment. Removal of 8-MOP after UVA exposure caused no significant changes in the apoptosis kinetics during the 72 h culture period compared with unwashed cells. The results of our in vitro study indicate that it could be possible to adjust the apoptosis kinetics via modulation of the 8-MOP incubation time. In further in vivo studies it should be elucidated to which extent different apoptosis kinetics influence the therapeutic effect of ECP since steady-state apoptosis levels are probably important for establishing a long lasting immune tolerance. Furthermore we found that Tregs, according to their well-known tolerogenic function, are more resistant to apoptosis after 8-MOP/UVA treatment compared to GvHD inducing T cell populations.
