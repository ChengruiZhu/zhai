How the fetoplacental arterial tree grows and expands during late gestational development is largely unknown. In this study, we quantified changes in arterial branching in the fetal exchange region of the mouse placenta during late gestation, when capillarization increases rapidly. We studied two commonly used mouse strains, CD1 and C57Bl/6 (B6), at embryonic days (E)13.5, 15.5, and 17.5. B6 mice differ from CD1 mice by exhibiting a blunted fetal weight gain in late gestation. We found that B6 capillarization and interhemal membrane thinning were reduced and placental hypoxia-inducible factor-1α and VEGF-A expression were higher than CD1 near term. Automated vascular segmentation of microcomputed tomography data sets revealed that the number of arterial vessels ≥50 μm remained constant during late gestation in both strains, despite large increases in downstream capillary volume quantified by stereology (+65% in B6 mice and +200% in CD1 mice). Arterial diameters expanded in both strains from E13.5 to E15.5; however, diameters continued to expand to E17.5 in B6 mice only. The diameter scaling coefficient at branch sites was near optimal (−3.0) and remained constant in CD1 mice, whereas it decreased, becoming abnormal, in B6 mice at term (−3.5 ± 0.2). Based on arterial tree geometry, resistance remained constant throughout late gestation (∼0.45 mmHg·s·μl
