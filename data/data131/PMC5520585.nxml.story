Despite advances in drug technology and improvements in technology, including peripheral nerve catheters and ultrasound, postoperative pain is still a significant problem in the clinical setting worldwide. Postoperative pain can have a critical negative impact with regard to physiological consequences to the body and therefore, the role of liposomal bupivacaine as an extended release bupivacaine with approximately 72 h of duration may have far-reaching and significant impact in clinical practice. Liposomal bupivacaine has a DepoFoam multivesicular liposome technology with particle suspension in an isotonic aqueous solution and consists of tiny lipid-based particles, which contain discrete water-filled chambers dispersed through a lipid matrix. Other advantages include a reduction in opioid consumption, while not requiring a catheter or any other device, as well as easy dilution with saline. This review summarizes current research with this novel agent in postsurgical pain, and discusses potential roles in chronic pain states. Further studies are warranted for its use in epidural and intrathecal administration. Moreover, this review will explore the expansion of liposomal bupivacaine's current clinical role.
