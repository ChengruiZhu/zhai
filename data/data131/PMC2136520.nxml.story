 was computed to be 150 to 160 minutes for both Lee and PR8. The number of particles, both infective and hemagglutinating, increased at a constant logarithmic rate for 6 hours or more after the adsorptive period. With Lee virus, at a particle-cell ratio of 5 or less, the doubling time was constant and had a value of 43 minutes. The dynamics of the logarithmic increase period suggest that reproduction corresponds to an autocatalytic reaction in which the rate is proportional to the amount of material produced. When the particle-cell ratio was increased to 10 or more, either with infective or non-infective (inactivated at 35°C. or 22°C.) particles, the doubling time increased to 65 minutes. Comparable effects from high ratios were found with PR8. Non-infective particles accumulated at a rapid rate after the interval of constant logarithmic increase regardless of the particle-cell ratio. This accumulation was even more striking with Lee than with PR8 as was expected because of the shorter half-life of the infective property. With both viruses at particle-cell ratios of 4 or more, a large proportion of the particles were non-infective within a few hours after new particles appeared. At particle-cell ratios of 0.2 or less, the maximal yield was relatively constant,
