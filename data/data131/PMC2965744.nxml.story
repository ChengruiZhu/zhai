Cardiovascular diseases are the primary cause of death in western countries. One of the main causes is lipid accumulation and plaque formation on arterial walls, called atherosclerosis. The risk of being exposed to this condition is reduced by high levels of high density lipoprotein (HDL). The functionality of HDL has remained elusive, and even its structure is not well understood. Through extensive coarse-grained simulations, we have clarified the structure of the lipid droplet in HDL and elucidated its interactions with the apolipoprotein A-I (apoA-I) that surrounds the droplet. We have found that the structural and dynamic properties of lipids depend significantly on their location in the particle (core, intermediate region, surface). As for apoA-I, we have observed it alter the overall structure of the lipid droplet close to the HDL-water interface, with prominent changes taking place for cholesterol and other polar lipids. The nature of lipid-protein interactions is most favorable for cholesterol. Our results reveal that not only hydrophobicity but also conformational entropy are the driving forces in the formation of HDL structure, suggesting how the interplay and competition between entropy and detailed interactions may be used in nanoparticle and drug design through self-assembly.
