 data. A total of 96 breast cancer and distant normal breast tissues and 20 benign tumor tissue specimens were subjected to immunohistochemistry or reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) analysis of FLNa expression. Clinicopathological data were collected to analyze the association with FLNa expression. The FLNa protein was overexpressed in breast cancer tissues compared with distant normal mammary gland and benign breast tissues. The FLNa protein was expressed in 63.5% of breast cancer, with positive rates of 36, 66.7 and 84.6%, respectively, in stage I, II and III breast cancer patients (P<0.05). Overexpression of the FLNa protein was associated with advanced stage, lymph node metastasis, vascular or neural invasion, menstruation state and other risk stratifications for breast cancer. The overexpression of FLNa in breast cancer was validated by RT-PCR, indicating transcriptional regulation of FLNa overexpression in breast cancer. FLNa mRNA and protein were overexpressed in breast cancer tissues, which was associated with advanced stage, lymph node metastasis and vascular or neural invasion of breast cancer, suggesting that FLNa contributes to breast cancer development and progression.
