Cardiac metastasis of uterine cervical cancer with antemortem diagnosis is extremely rare. Therefore, its landscape epidemiology has not been well elucidated to date. In the present study, a case of solitary cardiac metastasis of uterine cervical cancer diagnosed antemortem is reported, and a review of the currently available literature (which includes 18 cases of cardiac metastasis of uterine cervical cancer) is conducted. In January 2013, a 78-year-old woman with squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) of the uterine cervix (International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics stage IIIb) underwent definitive radiotherapy at Gunma University Hospital (Gunma, Japan). Follow-up examination at 5 months after completion of the treatment indicated no evidence of recurrence or metastasis. In April 2014, the patient reported epigastric discomfort and general malaise. Electrocardiogram suggested myocardial dysfunction. Transthoracic echocardiography revealed the presence of a mass occupying the right ventricle and pericardial effusion. Cine magnetic resonance imaging demonstrated a filling defect in the right ventricle, and transcatheter biopsy confirmed SCC. The patient was diagnosed with a solitary cardiac metastasis of uterine cervical cancer. Despite aggressive medical therapy, the patient succumbed to disease 31 days after admission to hospital. A review of the current literature revealed that 84% of cases of cardiac metastasis develop within 2 years of completion of the initial treatment, and that electrocardiogram and echocardiography reveal findings of myocardial dysfunction and the presence of a mass in the right ventricle, respectively. A treatment strategy for cardiac metastasis of uterine cervical cancer has not been standardized thus far, and the prognosis is very poor, as the majority of patients succumbed to disease within 1 year. In summary, the current case and the literature review conducted in the present study suggest that: i) Cardiac metastasis should be included in the differential diagnosis in cases with nonspecific complaints such as epigastric discomfort and general malaise when patients have a history of uterine cervical cancer, particularly within the previous 2 years; and ii) electrocardiogram and echocardiography are convenient and effective modalities for the diagnosis of cardiac metastasis of uterine cervical cancer.
