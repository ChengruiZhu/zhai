Epidemiological data provide strong evidence of dramatically increasing incidences of many autoimmune diseases in the past few decades, mainly in western and westernized countries. Recent studies clearly revealed that ‘Western diet’ increases the risk of autoimmune diseases at least partially via disrupting intestinal tight junctions and altering the construction and metabolites of microbiota. However, the role of high sucrose cola beverages (HSCBs), which are one of the main sources of added sugar in the western diet, is barely known. Recently, a population study showed that regular consumption of sugar-sweetened beverages is associated with increased risk of seropositive rheumatoid arthritis in women, which provokes interest in the genuine effects of these beverages on the pathogenesis of autoimmune diseases and the underlying mechanisms. Here we showed that long-term consumption of caffeine-free HSCBs aggravated the pathogenesis of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis in mice in a microbiota-dependent manner. Further investigation revealed that HSCBs altered community structure of microbiota and increased Th17 cells. High sucrose consumption had similar detrimental effects while caffeine contamination limited the infiltrated pathogenic immune cells and counteracted these effects. These results uncovered a deleterious role of decaffeinated HSCBs in aggravating the pathogenesis of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis in mice.
