We did this systematic review to determine diagnostic accuracy of sono-elastography in evaluating cervical lymph nodes (LNs). A highly sensitive search for sono-elastography and LNs was performed in MEDLINE, Cochrane Library, ACP Journal Club, EMBASE, Health Technology assessment, and ISI web of knowledge for studies published prior to December 2012. SPSS version 18 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA) used for descriptive analysis and meta-disk version 1.4 applied for meta-analysis. Forest plots for pooled estimates and summery of receiver operating characteristic plots for different cut-offs were produced. The literature and manual search yielded 69 articles, of which 10 were eligible to include. A total of 578 individuals with a total number of 936 cervical LNs was evaluated (502 malignant and 434 benign). The summary sensitivity of the scoring and strain ratio (SR) measurements for the differentiation of benign and malignant LNs were 0.76 (95% CI: 0.71–0.8) and 0.83 (95% CI: 0.78–0.87). The summary specificities were 0.8 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.75–0.84) and 0.84 (95% CI: 0.79–0.88), respectively. Area under the curve for scoring system was 0.86 (standard error [SE] = 0.03) and 0.95 (SE = 0.02) for SR measurement. Sono-elastograohy has high accuracy in differentiating benign and malignant cervical LNs.
