The VistaCam® system (Durr Dental, Bietigheim‐Bissingen, Germany) has been suggested as an adjunct to clinical examination for dental caries. This study assessed whether the digital scores obtained for tooth surfaces were affected by the colour of the carious lesions present and by the presence of saliva or blood on the tooth surface. The VistaCam intra‐oral ries, or with sound enamel and root surfaces, with or without overlying dental plaque biofilm. Teeth that had undergone root treatment or were stained by tetracycline were also assessed. Readings were taken in the dry state and after application of human stimulated saliva or venous blood onto the surface of the samples. VistaCam fluorescence scores for all samples were similar in the dry state, and when covered with saliva (P > 0.05), however a coating of dilute blood elevated the readings for most samples to a high level (P < 0.01), other than tetracycline stained teeth and dental caries (P > 0.05). Readings for healthy enamel were 0.9–1.1, and these increased up to 2.8 in the presence of blood. VistaCam fluorescence scores are not affected by dryness or moisture from the presence of saliva but increase when traces of blood are present. This problem needs to be taken into account when the device is used clinically, because blood from the gingival crevice is a common contaminant of tooth surfaces when patients have widespread gingival inflammation. There are also issues with elevated scores from background fluorescence from tetracyclines, which need to be considered when the system is in clinical use.
