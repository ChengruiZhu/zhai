. However, its mechanisms are unknown. Signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) is constitutively active in GBM and correlates positively with the glioma grades. In addition, as a specific transcription factor, STAT3 serves as the convergent point of various signaling pathways activated by multiple growth factors and/or cytokines. Therefore, we hypothesized that the proliferation inhibition and apoptosis induction by Ad-bFGF-siRNA may result from the interruption of STAT3 phosphorylation. In the current study, we found that in glioma cells U251, Ad-bFGF-siRNA impedes the activation of ERK1/2 and JAK2, but not Src, decreases IL-6 secretion, reduces STAT3 phosphorylation, decreases the levels of downstream molecules CyclinD1 and Bcl-xl, and ultimately results in the collapse of mitochondrial membrane potentials as well as the induction of mitochondrial-related apoptosis. Our results offer a potential mechanism for using Ad-bFGF-siRNA as a gene therapy for glioma. To our knowledge, it is the first time that the bFGF knockdown using adenovirus-mediated delivery of bFGF siRNA and its potential underlying mechanisms are reported. Therefore, this finding may open new avenues for developing novel treatments against GBM.
