A central goal of biology is to understand the function of the organism and its constituent parts at each of its scales of complexity. Function at the molecular level is often realized by changes in conformation. Unfortunately, experimental explorations of global motions critical for functional conformational changes are still challenging. In the present work, we developed a coarse grained triple-well structure-based model to explore the underlying functional landscape of maltose-binding protein (MBP). By quantitative flux analysis, we uncover the underlying mechanism by which the major induced fit and minor population shift pathways co-exist. Though we have previously lent credence to the assertion that dynamical equilibrium between open and minor closed conformations exist for all the free PBPs, the generality of this rule is still a matter of open debate. We found that the hinge flexibility is favorable to population shift mechanism. This finding provides a theoretical explanation of the mechanism discrepancies in PBP protein family. We also simulated the folding dynamics using this functional multi-basin model which successfully reproduced earlier protein melting experiment. This represents an exciting opportunity to characterize the interplay between folding and function, which is a long-standing question in the community. The theoretical approach employed in this study is general and can be applied to other systems.
