Identification of sequential progenitors leading to blood formation from pluripotent stem cells (PSCs) will be essential for understanding the molecular mechanisms of hematopoietic lineage specification and for development of technologies for in vitro production of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs). It is well established that during development, blood and endothelial cells in the extraembryonic and embryonic compartments are formed in parallel from precursors with angiogenic and hematopoietic potentials. However, the identity and hierarchy of these precursors in human PSC (hPSC) cultures remain obscure. Using developmental stage-specific mesodermal and endothelial markers and functional assays, we recently identified discrete populations of angiohematopoietic progenitors from hPSCs, including mesodermal precursors and hemogenic endothelial cells with primitive and definitive hematopoietic potentials. In addition, we discovered a novel population of multipotent hematopoietic progenitors with an erythroid phenotype, which retain angiogenic potential. Here we introduce our recent findings and discuss their implication for defining putative HSC precursor and factors required for activation of self-renewal potential in hematopoietic cells emerging from endothelium.
