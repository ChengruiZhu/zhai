Four large datasets yielding 674 ICIQ-SF score/PGI-I outcome data pairs were used in this study for (a) determining and (b) validating the cut-off ICIQ-SF score for a successful PGI-I outcome. Two long-term follow-up datasets were used representing follow-up periods of 3 and 8 years of a randomized controlled trial (RCT) performed between April 2005 and April 2007 in a tertiary urogynaecology centre in Scotland, UK. All patients had urodynamic SUI or mixed urinary incontinence (MUI, with predominant SUI) and were randomized to treatment with either an inside-out or an outside-in transobturator tape (TVT-O or TOT, respectively) as a sole procedure. The datasets yielded 432 ICIQ-SF score/PGI-I outcome data pairs. Successful outcome was defined as “very much improved/much improved” on the PGI-I scale. SPSS v. 22.0 (IBM Corp., Armonk, NY) was used for all statistical analyses. The correlations and cut-off scores generated were then validated on two independent datasets representing the 1-year and 4-year follow-up periods of the multicentre RCT in six units in the UK. The datasets yielded 242 ICIQ-SF score/PGI-I outcome data pairs. All patients had urodynamic SUI or MUI (with predominant SUI) and were randomized to either adjustable single incision minisling (SIMS) or TVT-O.
