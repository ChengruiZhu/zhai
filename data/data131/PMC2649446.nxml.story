Dynamic processes underlie the functions of all proteins. Hence, to understand, control, and design protein functions in the cell, we need to unravel the basic principles of protein dynamics. This is fundamental in studying the mechanisms of a specific class of proteins known as molecular chaperones, which oversee the correct conformational maturation of other proteins. In particular, molecular chaperones of the stress response machinery have become the focus of intense research, because their upregulation is responsible for the ability of tumor cells to cope with unfavorable environments. This is largely centered on the expression and function of the molecular chaperone Hsp90, which has provided an attractive target for therapeutic intervention in cancer. Experiments have shown that the chaperone functions through a nucleotide-directed conformational cycle. Here, we show that it is possible to identify the effects of nucleotide-related chemical differences on functionally relevant motions at the atomic level of resolution. The protein may fluctuate at equilibrium among different available dynamic states, and binding of a specific partner may shift the equilibrium toward the thermodynamically most stable complexes. These results provide us with important mechanistic insight for the identification of new regulatory sites and the design of possible new drugs.
