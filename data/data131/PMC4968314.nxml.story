A total of 36 paired, fresh-frozen human knees were used. 24 knees (12 pairs) - each using a standard tibial tunnel - underwent all three techniques (TT, AM, HTT) for femoral tunnel placement, with direct measurement of femoral insertional overlap and femoral tunnel length for each technique. The remaining 12 knees (6 pairs) were used to evaluate graft kinematics and tunnel orientation. Among these knees, 3 size-matched groups (four specimens each) were assigned to each of TT, AM and HTT techniques. Specimens were tested in quad-load induced extension from 90o to 10o of flexion with a distal weight used to simulate half-shank, ankle and foot passive load. Bony kinematics were assessed using a trakSTAR motion tracking system with three sensors installed in each femur and tibia. After femoral tunnel preparation, two sensors were installed in each tunnel to relate tunnel orientation and tunnel inlet location within the joint to the sensors used for motion tracking for the femur and tibia of each specimen. Bone-patellar-bone autografts were harvested from each specimen and used for the assigned reconstructive technique. Analysis included determination of ACL graft length changes, ACL-to-femoral tunnel angle and ACL-to-tibial tunnel angle at five flex/ext angles. Data was analyzed for three flex/ext tests on each specimen.
