Our results show that treatment of MCF-7 cells with IL6 and IL8, alone or together, induced the appearance of cells with fibroblastoid morphology, increased CD44 expression and migration, self-renewal and multilineage differentiation capacity, all characteristics compatible with an EMT program and stemness. These changes closely resembled those induced by a SCM. Interestingly, SCM treatments further increased IL6 and IL8 secretion by MCF-7 cells, thus suggesting the participation of an autocrine loop. Indeed, neutralizing antibodies against IL6 and IL8 reversed the effects of SCM on MCF-7, pinpointing these cytokines as major mediators of EMT and stemness-related effects associated with the senescent microenvironment. Additionally, prolonged exposure of MCF cells to IL6 or IL8 induced the appearance of senescent cells, suggesting a mechanism by which senescence and inflammation are reinforced favouring the acquisition of EMT and stem-like features at the population level, thus increasing tumour aggressiveness. Strikingly, our results also show that both IL6 and IL8 are important to maintain aggressive traits in MDA-MB-231 cells, a highly tumorigenic cell line, which appears to be devoid of stemness-related features.
