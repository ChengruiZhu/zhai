The primary cilium is a non-motile and microtubule-enriched protrusion ensheathed by plasma membrane. Primary cilia function as mechano/chemosensors and signaling hubs and their disorders predispose to a wide spectrum of human diseases. Most types of cells assemble their primary cilia in response to cellular quiescence, whereas they start to retract the primary cilia upon cell-cycle reentry. The retardation of ciliary resorption process has been shown to delay cell-cycle progression to the S or M phase after cell-cycle reentry. Apart from this conventional concept of ciliary disassembly linked to cell-cycle reentry, recent studies have led to a novel concept, suggesting that cells can suppress primary cilia assembly during cell proliferation. Accumulating evidence has also demonstrated the importance of Aurora-A (a protein originally identified as one of mitotic kinases) not only in ciliary resorption after cell-cycle reentry but also in the suppression of ciliogenesis in proliferating cells, whereas Aurora-A activators are clearly distinct in both phenomena. Here, we summarize the current knowledge of how cycling cells suppress ciliogenesis and compare it with mechanisms underlying ciliary resorption after cell-cycle reentry. We also discuss a reciprocal relationship between primary cilia and cell proliferation.
