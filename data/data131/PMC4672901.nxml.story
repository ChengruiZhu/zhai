Genetic analysis of learning in the black-bellied vinegar fly has revealed that a brain structure called the mushroom body is important to insect memory. The mushroom body contains three lobes with strikingly different shapes. A series of studies have concluded that the lobes have markedly different relevance to memory. For short-term memory, some studies have concluded that only a single lobe–the gamma lobe–is required. However, others have concluded that at least one of the other lobes is also involved. These studies used a data analysis method called ‘null hypothesis significance testing’ that may overemphasize differences between data. We examined whether estimation statistics, an alternative data analysis framework, could be used to verify or refute the lobular specialization hypothesis. Estimation statistics review methods were used to analyze published data on this topic. The estimation models indicate no evidence for lobular specialization, but instead show that neurons in all lobes contribute to short-term memory. These results verify a model in which learning is processed in a distributed manner across the mushroom body. These findings also demonstrate that estimation methods can be successfully harnessed for the analysis of complex experimental research data.
