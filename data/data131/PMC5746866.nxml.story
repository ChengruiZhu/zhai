Methods for selective
oxidation of aliphatic C–H bonds are
called on to revolutionize organic synthesis by providing novel and
more efficient paths. Realization of this goal requires the discovery
of mechanisms that can alter in a predictable manner the innate reactivity
of these bonds. Ideally, these mechanisms need to make oxidation of
aliphatic C–H bonds, which are recognized as relatively inert,
compatible with the presence of electron rich functional groups that
are highly susceptible to oxidation. Furthermore, predictable modification
of the relative reactivity of different C–H bonds within a
molecule would enable rapid diversification of the resulting oxidation
products. Herein we show that by engaging in hydrogen bonding, fluorinated
alcohols exert a polarity reversal on electron rich functional groups,
directing iron and manganese catalyzed oxidation toward a priori stronger
and unactivated C–H bonds. As a result, selective hydroxylation
of methylenic sites in hydrocarbons and remote aliphatic C–H
oxidation of otherwise sensitive alcohol, ether, amide, and amine
substrates is achieved employing aqueous hydrogen peroxide as oxidant.
Oxidations occur in a predictable manner, with outstanding levels
of product chemoselectivity, preserving the first-formed hydroxylation
product, thus representing an extremely valuable tool for synthetic
planning and development.
