 In the accompanying paper, a compartmental model for the toad bladder sodium transport system was developed. In the present paper, the model is tested by determining the effects of antidiuretic hormone on the pools and fluxes. It is shown that this hormone affects only that sodium pool previously designated as the transport pool, and that the effects are on two separate sites. In the first place, the hormone stimulates entry at the mucosal side of the transport compartment, and by this means brings about an increase in the amount of sodium contained in the compartment. Second, the hormone has a distinct stimulatory effect on the rate coefficient for efflux across the serosal boundary, the pump rate coefficient. Evidence is presented that under control conditions, the pump rate coefficient is a decreasing function of the pool size, a characteristic feature of a saturating system. Therefore, the effect of vasopressin in increasing both the pool size and the pump rate coefficient must be construed as a direct effect on the pump, and not one which is secondary to the increase in the pool size. Furthermore, it is shown that the effect of the hormone on the sodium pump is not dependent on the presence of sodium in the serosal medium.
