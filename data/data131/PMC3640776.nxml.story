Along with the global fervor over evidence based medicine (EBM), certain measures have been taken in Iran too. Many educational workshops and national and international seminars have been held. Multiple educational packages have been prepared and even included in the educational curriculum. In recent years, policies have been directed toward encouraging clinical guidelines, health technology assessment reports and policy briefs. Also, recently, the ‘National Strategic Program in Evidence-Based Health Care in the Islamic Republic of Iran’ has been defined by the Ministry of Health and Medical Education. In spite of all these efforts, studies that follow the uptake of evidence-based contents at the bedside show that EBM is not used in practice and at the bedside. The overall effect of the efforts mentioned is the knowledge promotion of the participants of the educational programs and or increasing their abilities in articles’ critical appraisal; nothing has been added in the practice arena. It seems that, in Iran, EBM’s current and future needs are to focus on its implementation, what is in other words called ‘knowledge translation’ or the application of scientific evidence.
