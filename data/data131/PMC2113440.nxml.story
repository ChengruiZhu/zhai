Mouse monoclonal antibody, S-30, was produced from hybridoma preparation from mice injected with the cytoskeleton extract of an in vitro aged culture of human fibroblasts derived from a 66-yr-old donor. The antibody stains positively the nuclei of the nonproliferating cells present predominantly in the senescent cultures of five selected fibroblast strains derived from donors of different age groups, whereas a negative reaction is observed in the cultures of their young counterparts. In the intermediate stage of the in vitro life span of these cell strains, a heterogeneous positive reaction for staining with S-30 antibody is observed in different subfractions of cell cultures. However, the expression of S-30 can be induced in the young fibroblasts at the early stage of their life by prolonged culturing to confluence. This induced expression of S-30 nuclear staining can be depleted upon subculturing at low cell density. Immunoelectron microscopy with colloidal gold-protein A complex demonstrates that the S-30 proteins are present in the nuclear plasma and at the region of nuclear envelope in a clustered arrangement. Immunoprecipitation of [3H]leucine labeled cell specimens shows that the antibody S-30 reacts with a protein with a molecular weight of approximately 57,000.
