). Intranasal administration of human recombinant IFNβ occurred 2 hr after HIE and infarct volume, body weight, neurobehavioral tests, histology, immunohistochemistry, brain water content, blood–brain barrier permeability, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, and Western blot were all used to evaluate various parameters. The results showed that both IFNβ and the Type 1 interferon receptor expression decreases after HIE. Intranasal administration of human recombinant IFNβ was able to be detected in the central nervous system and was able to reduce brain infarction volumes and improve neurological behavior tests 24 hr after HIE. Western blot analysis also revealed that human recombinant IFNβ treatment stimulated Stat3 and Bcl-2 expression leading to a decrease in cleaved caspase-3 expression after HIE. Positive Fluoro-Jade C staining also demonstrated that IFNβ treatment was able to decrease neuronal apoptosis. Furthermore, the beneficial effects of IFNβ treatment were reversed when a Stat3 inhibitor was applied. Also an intraperitoneal administration of human recombinant IFNβ into the systemic compartment was unable to confer the same protective effects as intranasal IFNβ treatment.
