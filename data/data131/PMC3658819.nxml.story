All over the world, and also in Slovenia, left-sided displacement of the abomasum (LDA) occurs most commonly in large-sized, high-producing adult dairy cows immediately after parturition. Yearly retrospective analyses of our ambulatory records showed significantly increased prevalence of LDA (2000 = 0.9%, 2010 = 3.7%), especially in cows after first parturition. Surgical replacement is now commonly practiced, and many techniques have been devised with emphasis on avoidance of recurrence of the displacement. Because of good results as recorded in the literature and encouragement of Keith E. Sterner, the author of this method, we want to try the right paramedian abomasopexyâ€”Grymer/Sterner model. Since May 2009 till October 2011 109 cows from 46 farms were operated on because of LDA. As many as 44 (40.3%) were affected with LDA after first parturition. The analysis of successful procedure that was carried out 2 months after suture showed that 104 (95.4%) cows were cured. Only 5 (4.5%) cows died within 24 hours after surgery (4 cases of severe toxemia with hypokalemia and one case of acute abomasal hemorrhage were established). Our experience with Grymer/Sterner LDA transfixation sutures proved favorable. Because roll-and-toggle-pin suture technique is rapid and inexpensive we recommend it.
