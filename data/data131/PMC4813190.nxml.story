 tumor formation. Through the Boyden chamber migration assay, we found that non-toxic levels of WEGST could not attenuate the PC3 migration to the bottom area coated with serum but significantly inhibited PC3 cell migration to the collagen-coated bottom area. We also found that non-toxic levels of WEGST significantly attenuated collagen against adhesion. Interestingly, ectopic administration of WEGST could not affect the expression of α2β1 integrin, which is known as a receptor of collagen. However, when the PC3 cells adhered to a collagen-coated plate, the expression of α2 integrin but not that of β1 integrin was significantly inhibited by the administration of non-toxic levels of WEGST, leading to the inhibition of focal adhesion kinase (FAK) phosphorylation. Furthermore, oral administration of WEGST (25 mg/kg/day) significantly inhibited the size of a PC3 cell-xenografted tumor. Taken together, these results suggest a novel molecular mechanism for WEGST to inhibit prostate cancer progression at particular stages, such as collagen-mediated adhesion and migration, and it might provide further development for the therapeutic use of WEGST in the treatment of prostate cancer progression.
