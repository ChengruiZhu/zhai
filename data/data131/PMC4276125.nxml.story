In control and two weeks evolution streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats, either untreated or receiving anakinra, vascular reactivity and NADPH oxidase activity were measured, respectively, in isolated rings and homogenates from mesenteric microvessels, while nuclear factor (NF)-κB activation was determined in aortas. Plasma levels of IL-1β and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α were measured by ELISA. In isolated mesenteric microvessels from control rats, two hours incubation with IL-1β (1 to 10 ng/mL) produced a concentration-dependent impairment of endothelium-dependent relaxations, which were mediated by enhanced NADPH oxidase activity via IL-1 receptors. In diabetic rats treated with anakinra (100 or 160 mg/Kg/day for 3 or 7 days before sacrifice) a partial improvement of diabetic endothelial dysfunction occurred, together with a reduction of vascular NADPH oxidase and NF-κB activation. Endothelial dysfunction in diabetic animals was also associated to higher activities of the pro-inflammatory enzymes cyclooxygenase (COX) and the inducible isoform of nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), which were markedly reduced after anakinra treatment. Circulating IL-1β and TNF-α levels did not change in diabetic rats, but they were lowered by anakinra treatment.
