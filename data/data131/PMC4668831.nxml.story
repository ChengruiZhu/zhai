The researchers combined national estimates of foodborne diseases and data from systematic reviews (studies that identify all the research on a given topic using predefined criteria), national surveillance programs, and other sources to estimate the number of illnesses, sequelae, deaths and DALYs globally and regionally for 22 diseases with sufficient data to support such estimations. Together, these 17 bacterial infections, two viral infections, and three protozoal infections caused 2 billion cases of illness, more than 1 million deaths, and almost 80 million DALYs in 2010. Using information on the proportions of infections considered to be foodborne by expert panels, the researchers estimated that nearly a third of these cases of illness (582 million cases), resulting in 25 million DALYs, were transmitted by contaminated food. Notably, 38% of the cases of foodborne illness, 33% of deaths from these diseases, and 43% of the disease burden from contaminated food (11 million DALYs) occurred in children under 5 years old. The leading cause of foodborne illness was norovirus (125 million cases), closely followed by campylobacter (96 million); diarrheal and invasive infections caused by non-typhoidal
