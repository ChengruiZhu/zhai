 Using a sheep antiserum to human glomerular basement membrane (GBM), studies of urine from healthy adults showed the presence of two cross-reactive antigens. These antigens were purified partially by preparative electrophoresis and electrofocusing, and separated on G-200; both appeared to be acidic, of high molecular weight, and carbohydrate rich. Their immunologic relationship to human GBM solubilized by several techniques was deduced from lines of identity with the native GBM digests in double diffusion analyses. These antigens will combine with homologous anti-GBM antibodies and block their fixation to human kidney sections, and will evoke heterologous anti-GBM antibody production in the rabbit. Fractionation studies of normal human serum indicated the presence of trace amounts of basement membrane antigens in the circulation. Although the serum antigens appear immunologically identical to the urinary antigens, the precise anatomic structures from which both are derived is not certain. Demonstration of immunoreactive basement membrane antigens in the circulation provides a plausible source of immunogen for the potential development of anti-GBM antibody-mediated glomerulonephritis as well as a clue to a mode for reestablishment of tolerance in such an autoimmune disorder.
