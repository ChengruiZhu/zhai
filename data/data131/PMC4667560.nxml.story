 < 0.01). Of the included 120 neonates, 10 (8.3%) were stillborn, 99 (82.5%) had a five-minute Apgar score ≥7, and 4 (3.3%) had a five-minute Apgar score ≤3. The four neonates with severe neonatal distress died after admission to neonatal intensive care unit within one week after delivery. Out of 110 live-born neonates, 4 (3.6%) neonates had a low ejection fraction (EF) (<50%) due to HCM; of them 2 (1.8%) died within one week after delivery, while 2 (1.8%) survived. Another two (1.8%) neonates died from severe respiratory distress syndrome. A cutoff value of ≥4.5 mm for prenatal IVS thickness was predictive of neonatal distress due to HCM with a sensitivity of 82%, specificity of 68%, and diagnostic accuracy of 72%. A cutoff value of <1.18 for the ratio of IVS thickness to LMWT had a sensitivity of 82%, specificity of 72%, and diagnostic accuracy of 74% for the prediction of neonatal distress due to HCM. In this study, 8 of the 10 fetuses with intrauterine demise and the 2 neonates who died within one week after delivery due to heart failure had a prenatal IVS thickness of ≥4.5 mm, while 7 of the 10 fetuses with intrauterine demise and the 2 neonates who died postnatal from heart failure had a prenatal IVS thickness to LMWT ratio of ≤1.18.
