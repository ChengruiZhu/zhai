, we applied bi-clustering and gene set enrichment analysis methods to derive essential features of altered lung transcriptome following exposure to NMs that are associated with lung-specific diseases. Several datasets from public microarray repositories describing pulmonary diseases in mouse models following exposure to a variety of substances were examined and functionally related bi-clusters showing similar gene expression profiles were identified. The identified bi-clusters were then used to conduct a gene set enrichment analysis on lung gene expression profiles derived from mice exposed to nano-titanium dioxide, carbon black or carbon nanotubes (nano-TiO2, CB and CNTs) to determine the disease significance of these data-driven gene sets. The results of the analysis correctly identified all NMs to be inflammogenic, and only CB and CNTs as potentially fibrogenic. Here, we elaborate on the details of the statistical methods and algorithms used to derive the disease relevant gene signatures. These details will enable other investigators to use the gene signature in future Gene Set Enrichment Analysis studies involving NMs or as features for clustering and classifying NMs of diverse properties.
