The effects of a variety of K+ channel blockers on current flow through single serotonin-sensitive K+ channels (the S channels) of Aplysia sensory neurons were studied using the patch-clamp technique. Tetraethylammonium (TEA), 4-aminopyridine (4-AP), and Co2+ and Ba2+ were first applied to the external membrane surface using cell-free outside-out patches. At concentrations up to 10 mM, these agents had little or no effect on single S-channel currents. At higher concentrations, external TEA acted as a fast open-channel blocker, reducing the single-channel current amplitude according to a simple one- to-one binding scheme with an apparent Kd of 90 mM. Blockage by external TEA is voltage independent. Internal TEA also acts as an open- channel blocker, with an apparent Kd of approximately 40 mM and a relatively weak voltage dependence, corresponding to an apparent electrical distance to the internal TEA-binding site of 0.1. Both internal and external TEA block the open channel selectively, with an affinity that is 10-100-fold greater than the affinity for the closed channel. Internal Ba2+ acts as a slow channel blocker, producing long closures of the channel, and binding with an apparent Kd of approximately 25-30 microM. These results show that single S-channel currents share a similar pharmacological profile with the macroscopic S current previously characterized with voltage clamp. On the basis of these results, a structural model for S-channel opening is proposed.
