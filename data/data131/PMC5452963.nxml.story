Lung cancer is a major cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide, therefore identifying biomarkers for the early detection, grading or postoperative follow-up of lung cancer is of clinical significance. In the present study, expression of lung tissue (t)-CXCL16 and t-CXCR6 was examined in 58 patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) using immunohistochemical staining, and serum (s)-CXCL16 levels were detected in 58 patients with NSCLC and in 32 normal volunteers using an ELISA. A follow-up was performed every 4 months between January 2014 and January 2015. Compared with the normal volunteers, the s-CXCL16 concentration in patients with NSCLC significantly increased (329.47±135.38 vs. 572.82±116.05 pg/ml, respectively; P<0.001). When grouped according to TNM stage, the expression of t-CXCL16 (60 vs. 85.71%; P=0.029), t-CXCR6 (53.33 vs. 78.57%; P=0.043) and s-CXCL16 (26.67 vs. 57.14%, P=0.019) in the stage I–II subgroup was significantly lower compared with that of the stage III–IV subgroup. The positive expression rate of t-CXCL16 (91.18%) and t-CXCR6 (79.41%) in the lymph node metastasis subgroup was significantly higher compared with that of the corresponding non-lymph node metastasis subgroup (50 and 45.83%, respectively; P<0.01). Additionally, the positive expression rate of t-CXCL16 in the smoking subgroup was 100%, which was significantly higher compared with that of the non-smoking subgroup (23.81%) (P<0.001). The follow-up and mortality rates were 100% (58/58) and 13.79% (8/58), respectively. Within the time period of the present study, the survival time was 4–18 months, and the mean survival time was 16.6 months. In conclusion, the expression of t-CXCL16 and t-CXCR6 is positively correlated with the TNM stage and lymph node metastasis in patients with NSCLC. Additionally, there was a significant increase in s-CXCL16 levels in patients with NSCLC, suggesting that CXCL16 could be used as a supplementary biomarker for the early detection of NSCLC.
