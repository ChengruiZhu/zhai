Nuclear DNA quantity varies widely between species and is poorly correlated with gene number. Variation in genome size can be explained by differing amounts of repetitive DNA. Repetitive DNA may be mobile, meaning it can increase its copy number within genomes. To prevent this, plants and animals suppress expression of repeats, often by marking the repeated sequence with a methyl group on cytosine bases. DRM2 is an enzyme capable of establishing this methylation, which can be guided to target sequences by short complementary RNA guides. As repeated sequences are prone to generate short RNAs they are efficiently recognized and silenced. We show that DRM2 requires a related inactive DRM3 protein to normally silence repeated sequences. A similar situation exists in mammals, where active and inactive DNA methyltransferases act together to silence repeats. We also demonstrate that non-catalytic regions of the DRM2 enzyme are functionally important, which we speculate to be involved in targeting the enzyme to the genome. Although plant and mammal RNAâ€“directed DNA methylation systems share key similarities, there are important mechanistic differences, meaning that they are likely to have arisen convergently.
