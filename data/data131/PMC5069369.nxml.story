Variations of radial artery, in both its course and branching pattern in the anatomical snuffbox, are clinically significant for the plastic surgeons, cardiologists, and radiologists. Reports on its abnormal high origin and subsequent superficial course have been well documented. Herein, we report an unusual superficial branch of the radial artery given off before its entry into the palm by passing between the two heads of first dorsal interosseous. It eventually divided into princeps pollicis and radialis indicis arteries at the first web space of palm as a unique vascular variation. Apart from this, in the present case, the tendon of extensor digiti minimi and of extensor indicis divided into two parts. The split tendons of extensor digiti minimi were inserted to the dorsal digital expansion of the digitus minimus. However, lateral tendon of split extensor indicis was inserted along with the tendon of extensor digitorum to the index finger and the medial one was inserted along with the tendon of extensor digitorum to the middle finger. Unusual superficial branch of radial artery on the dorsum of the hand is vulnerable for an iatrogenic injury during surgical approaches in the region. Supplementary extensor tendons on the hand are one of the potential causes for the tenosynovitis.
