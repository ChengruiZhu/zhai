During development, embryonic stem cell (ESC) enter a program of cell differentiation eventually leading to all the necessary differentiated cell types. Understanding the mechanisms responsible for the underlying modifications of the gene expression program is of fundamental importance, as it will likely have strong impact on the development of regenerative medicine. We show that besides some epigenetic regulation, ubiquitous master replication origins at replication timing U-domain borders shared by 6 human cell types are transcriptionally active open chromatin regions specified by a local enrichment in nucleosome free regions encoded in the DNA sequence suggesting that they have been selected during evolution. In contrast, ESC specific master replication origins bear a unique epigenetic signature (enrichment in CTCF, H2AZ, NANOG, OCT4, â€¦) likely contributing to maintain ESC chromatin in a highly dynamic and accessible state that is refractory to polycomb and HP1 heterochromatin spreading. These ESC specific master origins thus appear as key genomic regions where epigenetic control of chromatin organization is at play to maintain pluripotency of stem cell lineages and to guide lineage commitment to somatic cell types.
