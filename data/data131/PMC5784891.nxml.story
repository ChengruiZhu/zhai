A recent genetic study of the UK (People of the British Isles; PoBI) expanded our understanding of population history of the islands, using newly-developed, powerful techniques that harness the rich information embedded in chunks of genetic code called haplotypes. These methods revealed subtle regional diversity across the UK, and, using genetic data alone, timed key migration events into southeast England and Orkney. We have extended these methods to Ireland, identifying regional differences in genetics across the island that adhere to geography at a resolution not previously reported. Our study reveals relative western diversity and eastern homogeneity in Ireland owing to a history of settlement concentrated on the east coast and longstanding Celtic diversity in the west. We show that Irish Celtic diversity enriches the findings of PoBI; haplotypes mirror geography across Britain and Ireland, with relic Celtic populations contributing greatly to haplotypic diversity. Finally, we used genetic information to date migrations into Ireland from Europe and Britain consistent with historical records of Viking and Norman invasions, demonstrating the signatures of these migrations the on modern Irish genome. Our findings demonstrate that genetic structure exists in even small isolated populations, which has important implications for population-based genetic association studies.
