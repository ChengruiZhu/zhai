Between December 2007 and November 2011, 20 patients were diagnosed to be suffering from mucoid degeneration of anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) on the basis of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), histopathology, and arthroscopy findings. 12 patients were males and 8 patients were females, with mean age of 42.2 years for males (range 28-52 years) and 39.4 years for females (range 30â€“54 years). They presented with pain on terminal extension (n=10) and on terminal flexion (n=2) without history of significant preceding trauma. MRI showed an increased signal in the substance of the ACL both in the T1- and T2-weighted images, with a mass-like configuration that was reported as a partial or complete tear of the ACL by the radiologist. At arthroscopy, the ACL was homogenous, bulbous, hypertrophied, and taut, occupying the entire intercondylar notch. A debulking of the ACL was performed by a judicious excision of the degenerated mucoid tissue, taking care to leave behind as much of the intact ACL as possible. Releasing it and performing a notchplasty treated impingement of the ACL to the roof and lateral wall. In one patient, we had to replace ACL due to insufficient tissue left behind to support the knee.
