, belonging to the Alphaproteobacteria, are considered some of the most covert emerging and re-emerging diseases and are being increasingly recognized. Among the major groups of rickettsioses, commonly reported diseases in India are scrub typhus, murine flea-borne typhus, Indian tick typhus and Q fever. Rickettsial infections are generally incapacitating and difficult to diagnose; untreated cases have case fatality rates as high as 30-45 per cent with multiple organ dysfunction, if not promptly diagnosed and appropriately treated. The vast variability and non-specific presentation of this infection have often made it difficult to diagnose clinically. Prompt antibiotic therapy shortens the course of the disease, lowers the risk of complications and in turn reduces morbidity and mortality due to rickettsial diseases. There is a distinct need for physicians and health care workers at all levels of care in India to be aware of the clinical features, available diagnostic tests and their interpretation, and the therapy of these infections. Therefore, a Task Force was constituted by the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) to formulate guidelines for diagnosis and management of rickettsial diseases. These guidelines include presenting manifestations, case definition, laboratory criteria (specific and supportive investigations) and treatment.
