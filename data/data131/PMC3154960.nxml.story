The telomeric cap modulates telomere replication and prevents natural chromosome ends from being processed as DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs). In multiple species, including budding yeast, a detailed picture exists of the factors that comprise the telomeric cap and how they associate with telomeric DNA. It is less clear where to place Ku, a conserved heterodimer involved in multiple aspects of telomere biology and DSB repair. Although Ku avidly binds DNA ends, its access to telomeric ends might be restricted by telomere binding proteins and/or higher-order telomere structure. Ku might also be recruited to telomeres via its telomere-associated binding partners. Here, we address whether Ku loads directly onto telomeric ends and whether direct DNA binding is crucial for its telomeric functions. Using structure-guided mutagenesis, we generated end binding–defective yeast Ku heterodimers that retained the ability to associate with Ku's known telomeric binding partners. These end binding–defective heterodimers showed a dramatic reduction in telomere association and were defective for all of Ku's telomeric functions. Our findings indicate that Ku is indeed a component of the telomere cap and that its loading onto telomeric ends is crucial for its telomeric functions and, perhaps, a specific telomere architecture.
