Class switch recombination (CSR) in B cells is required for interaction with different effector molecules while retaining the affinity for the same antigens. CSR mechanism involves the orchestrated steps of transcription, DNA break, and repair of the target loci. Within the cells, these processes occur at the chromatin level—involving DNA, histones, and their associated post-translational modifications (PTMs). Transcription factors associated with RNA Polymerase II complex often have regulatory roles in chromatin maintenance, which in turn might regulate the process of DNA cleavage and repair. Here we report that the transcription factor DSIF complex (Spt4 and Spt5) is critically required for CSR. The absence of either Spt4 or Spt5 blocked CSR. Interestingly, Spt4 and Spt5, although previously thought to work as a complex, can function independently of each other at several nodes of CSR, namely transcription regulation, DNA break formation, and histone PTM maintenance, exemplified by H3K4me3. The importance of H3K4me3 unifies three programmed recombinations—CSR, VDJ, and meiotic—in their reliance on this modification for their respective DNA cleavage formations. Moreover, Spt4 and Spt5 are required for DNA repair, another critical aspect of CSR, suggesting that the DNA repair steps of CSR may be coupled with transcription.
