While the basic receptive-field structure of cells in the dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus (dLGN), the station between retina and visual cortex in the early visual pathway, was mapped out half a century ago, the function of this nucleus in molding the visual signals is still poorly understood. One reason is that the dLGN contains enigmatic inhibitory interneurons which can act with different inhibitory action on the excitatory relay cells. In addition to standard axonal inhibition, relay cells and interneurons form so-called triadic synapses, where an interneuron dendritic terminal can be simultaneously postsynaptic to a retinal input and presynaptic to a relay-cell dendrite, opening up for so-called triadic inhibition. Taking advantage of a recently developed biophysically detailed multicompartmental model for an interneuron, we here use a network model to investigate putative effects of these inhibitory actions on the response properties of relay cells stimulated by circular flashing spots. Our results suggest a possible role of the different inhibitory actions in providing separate mechanisms for overall gain control (triadic inhibition) and regulation of spatial resolution (axonal inhibition) of visual signals sent to cortex.
