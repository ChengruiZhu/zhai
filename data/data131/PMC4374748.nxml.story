Major histocompatibility complex class I (MHCI) molecules are central to immunity and immunological disorders, and constitute a major obstacle in organ transplantation. It is therefore vital to gain insight into the regulation of their expression. NLRC5 was recently found to regulate MHCI gene transcription. However, we lack a thorough understanding of its target gene specificity and mechanism of action. Our work addresses these questions, delineating the unique consensus sequence required for NLRC5 recruitment and pinpointing conserved features conferring its specificity. Furthermore, through genome-wide analyses, we confirm that NLRC5 regulates classical MHCI genes and identify novel target genes, all encoding non-classical MHCI molecules exerting an array of functions in immunity and tolerance. We thereby demonstrate that NLRC5 exclusively transactivates genes of the MHCI pathway, rendering it an attractive target for future therapeutic intervention. The most striking feature of NLRC5 is its restricted and highly focused transcriptional activity, which has been described so far only for one related factor, CIITA. NLRC5 and CIITA therefore emerge as prototypes for a novel kind of extremely specific transcriptional regulator.
