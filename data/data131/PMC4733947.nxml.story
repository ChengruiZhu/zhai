The aim of the present study was to compare the dosimetry features of volumetric-modulated arc therapy (VMAT) and fixed field intensity-modulated radiotherapy (f-IMRT) in postoperative irradiation of stage IB-IIA high-risk cervical cancer. Fifteen patients exhibiting stage IB-IIA high-risk cervical cancer, who had been treated with postoperative adjuvant concurrent radiochemotherapy, were selected. The clinical target volume (CTV) and organs at risk (OARs) were delineated according to contrast computed tomography images. The planning target volume (PTV) was subsequently produced by using 1 cm uniform expansion of the CTV. The treatment plans were intended to deliver 50 Gy in 25 fractions. The OARs that were contoured included the bladder, rectum, small bowel and femoral heads. Dose volume histograms were used to evaluate the dose distribution in the PTV and OARs. VMAT and f-IMRT treatment plans resulted in similar dose coverage of the PTV. VMAT was superior to f-IMRT in conformity (P<0.05), and resulted in a reduction of OARs irradiated at high dose levels (V40 and V50) compared with f-IMRT (P<0.05), particularly for the bladder. However, the doses of low levels (V10 and V20) delivered to OARs with f-IMRT were slightly reduced compared with VMAT (P<0.05). For ambilateral femoral heads, VMAT demonstrated improved sparing compared with f-IMRT, with regard to D5 (P<0.05). Furthermore, VMAT treatment plans revealed a significant reduction in monitor units (MU) and treatment time. VMAT techniques exhibited similar PTV coverage compared with f-IMRT. At doses of high levels delivered to OARs, VMAT demonstrated improved sparing compared with f-IMRT, particularly for the bladder, while significantly reducing treatment time and MU number.
