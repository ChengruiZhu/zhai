Transplantation of stem cells requires a huge amount of cells, deeming the expansion of the cells in vitro necessary. The aim of this study is to define the optimal combination of basal medium and serum for the expansion of suspension peripheral blood mononucleated stem cells (PBMNSCs) without resulting in loss in the differentiation potential. Mononucleated cells were isolated from both mice and human peripheral blood samples through gradient centrifugation and expanded in α-MEM, RPMI, MEM or DMEM supplemented with either NBCS or FBS. The suspension cells were then differentiated to osteoblast. Our data suggested that α-MEM supplemented with 10 % (v/v) NBCS gives the highest fold increase after 14 days of culture for both mice and human PBMNSCs, which were ~1.51 and ~2.01 times, respectively. The suspension PBMNSCs in the respective medium were also able to maintain osteoblast differentiation potential as supported by the significant increase in ALP specific activity. The cells are also viable during the differentiated states when using this media. All these data strongly suggested that α-MEM supplemented with 10 % NBCS is the best media for the expansion of both mouse and human suspension PBMNSCs.
