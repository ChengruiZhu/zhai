The aims of this study were to identify static and dynamic balance with the addition of weighted vests for the rehabilitation of paraplegic patients. The study was conducted using weighted vest exercises with applied optimal weight ratios. Ten paraplegic patients who use custom orthosis were enrolled for experiments including static standing and dynamic gait with a weighted vest. We set weight ratios as 0%, 10%, and 15% of the patients’ weight. A plantar pressure device was used for static balance tests for excursion and velocity of center of pressure and we identified dynamic balance through the tool of Timed Up and Go (TUG) test. The results of static and dynamic balance in 0%, 10%, and 15% weight ratios did not have statistically significant differences, but we found an increasing tendency of sway excursion from nonweight (0%) to weight ratios (10%, 15%) in static balance when weight is applied. Sway excursion in anteroposterior direction is greater than mediolateral sway. In dynamic balance, the TUG results showed a more delayed time when weight ratios were applied. In conclusion, we have to focus on balance training with anteroposterior direction to upgrade a patient’s balance and prevent falls. Exercises with weighed vests are more useful than nonweighted but there is no difference between 10% and 15% weight ratios. Weighted vest exercises may play a role in the rehabilitation of balance in those with paraplegia.
