Cell typeâ€“specific gene expression patterns are largely regulated by positively or negatively acting transcription factors binding to promoter and enhancer elements. The ubiquitous transcription factor Sp3 represents a paradigm for a dual function transcription factor as it can activate and repress transcription. The repression function of Sp3 is mediated by attachment of a small protein designated SUMO to a single lysine residue. SUMOylation of Sp3 thus acts as a molecular switch that determines whether Sp3 acts as an activator or repressor. In this study, we have generated mice with a subtle mutation in the SUMO attachment site of Sp3. We found that several spermatocyte- and brain-specific genes that are silenced in non-testicular and extra-neuronal tissues of wild-type animals become aberrantly de-repressed in mice in which the SUMO attachment site of Sp3 is mutated. De-repression of these genes is accompanied with dramatic epigenetic changes including the loss of repressive histone methylation marks and, most significantly, loss of DNA methylation. Our findings suggest that SUMO modification of a transcription factor can act as a molecular beacon for the assembly of repression machineries to maintain tissue-specific transcriptional gene silencing
