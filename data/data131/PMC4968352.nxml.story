One hundred and twenty-two patients (10.1%) underwent a total of 172 subsequent procedures on the ipsilateral knee at 2-year follow-up. Of the reoperation procedures, 26.7% were meniscus procedures (69% meniscectomy, 26% repair), 18.6% were subsequent rACLR, 17.4% were cartilage procedures (61% chondroplasty, 17% microfracture, and 13% mosaicplasty), 10% hardware removal, and 9.3% were procedures for arthrofibrosis such has lysis of adhesions and synovectomy. Patients who had reoperations had significantly lower IKDC, KOOS symptoms and pain scores, and WOMAC stiffness scores at two-year follow up. Multivariate analysis revealed that patients under 20 years old were 2.1 times more likely than patients aged 20-29 to have a reoperation. Use of allograft at the time of rACLR and staged revision (bone grafting of tunnels before rACLR) were also significant predictors for need for reoperation within 2 years. Patients with grade IV cartilage damage seen during rACLR were 47% less likely to undergo subsequent operations within 2 years. Gender, BMI, smoking history, Marx activity score, technique for femoral tunnel placement and meniscal tear or meniscal treatment at the time of rACLR showed no significant effect on reoperation rate.
