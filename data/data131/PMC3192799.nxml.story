In the last two decades our knowledge on stress-induced changes has been expanded rapidly. As a part of this work a large number of key proteins and biological processes of cellular adaptation to stress have been uncovered. However, we know relatively little on the systems level changes of the cell in stress. In our study we used the network approach to study the changes of the yeast protein-protein interaction network (interactome) in the archetype of stress, heat shock. The major finding of our study is that heat shock induced a marked decrease in the inter-community connections of the yeast interactome. The observed changes resembled to a ‘stratus-cumulus’ type transition of the interactome structure, since the unstressed yeast interactome had a globally connected organization, similar to that of stratus clouds, whereas the heat shocked interactome had a multifocal organization, similar to that of cumulus clouds. Our results indicated that heat shock induces a partial disintegration of the global protein-protein network structure of yeast cells. This change may be rather general occurring at the initial phase of crises in many complex systems, such as proteins in physical stretch, ecosystems in abrupt environmental changes or social networks in economic crisis.
