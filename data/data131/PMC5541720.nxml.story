Glutamine commonly becomes a conditionally essential amino acid in cancer. Glutamine is supplied to the cell by transporters such as ASCT2 (SLC1A5), which is frequently upregulated in multiple cancers. Here we investigated the expression of ASCT2 in endometrial carcinoma, and evaluated the contribution of ASCT2 to glutamine uptake and endometrial cancer cell growth. Analysis of human gene expression data showed that ASCT2 was significantly upregulated in both endometrioid and serous subtypes of endometrial carcinoma, compared to normal, age-matched endometrium. Furthermore, immunohistochemical staining of primary human endometrioid adenocarcinomas showed that tumours stain positive for ASCT2 in either a uniform or mosaic expression pattern, while normal adjacent glands appeared predominantly negative for ASCT2 staining. Chemical inhibition of glutamine transport by benzylserine or GPNA led to a significant decrease in endometrial cancer cell growth and spheroid cross-sectional area. ASCT2 knockdown recapitulated the decrease of cell growth and spheroid cross-sectional area in HEC1A cells, suggesting a reliance on ASCT2-mediated glutamine uptake. ASCT2 knockdown in Ishikawa cells led to lower glutamine uptake and cell growth, but did not affect spheroid area. Ishikawa cells express higher levels of the glutamine transporter SNAT1 compared to HEC1A cells, suggesting these cells may rely on both ASCT2 and SNAT1 for glutamine uptake. Since SNAT1 is also significantly upregulated in the endometrioid and serous subtypes, these data indicate that ASCT2 and SNAT1 could be used as markers of malignancy, and/or potential therapeutic targets in patients with endometrial carcinoma.
