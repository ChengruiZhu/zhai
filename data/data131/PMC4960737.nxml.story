A novel NASH model was generated by administration of streptozotocin to C57BL/6J mice at 2 days old, with a high-fat diet from 4 weeks. NASH mice aged 6 weeks were divided into four groups of 6 animals: vehicle, linagliptin (10 mg/kg), empagliflozin (10 mg/kg), and linagliptin + empagliflozin. The histological non-alcoholic fatty liver disease activity score was significantly lower in the empagliflozin and linagliptin + empagliflozin groups than in the vehicle or linagliptin groups. Hepatic expression of inflammatory genes (tumor necrosis factor-α, interleukin-6, and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1) was decreased in the empagliflozin and linagliptin + empagliflozin groups compared with the vehicle group. The collagen deposition with Sirius red staining was significantly reduced in the linagliptin + empagliflozin group compared with the linagliptin or the empagliflozin group. Immunohistochemistry showed that expression of α-smooth muscle actin, a marker of myofibroblasts (fibrosis), was reduced in the linagliptin + empagliflozin group compared with the vehicle group, as was expression of type 1 and 3 collagen mRNA. Linagliptin + empagliflozin decreased expression of mRNAs for genes related to fatty acid synthesis, but did not increase mRNAs for β-oxidation-related genes.
