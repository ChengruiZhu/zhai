In mammals, a few thousand transcription factors regulate the differential expression of more than 20,000 genes to specify âˆ¼200 functionally distinct cell types during development. How this is accomplished has been a major focus of biology. Transcription factors bind non-coding DNA regulatory elements, including proximal promoters and distal enhancers, to control gene expression. Emerging evidence indicates that transcription factor binding at distal enhancers plays an important role in the establishment of tissue-specific gene expression programs during development. Further, combinatorial binding among groups of transcription factors can further increase the diversity and specificity of regulatory modules. Here, we report the genome-wide binding profile of the HMG-box containing transcription factor SOX2 in mouse embryonic stem cells (ESCs) and neural progenitor cells (NPCs), and we show that SOX2 occupied a distinct set of binding sites with POU homeodomain family members, OCT4 in ESCs and BRN2 in NPCs. Thus, transitions in SOX2-POU partners may control tissue-specific gene networks. Ultimately, a global analysis detailing the combinatorial binding of transcription factors across all tissues is critical to understand cell fate specification in the context of the complex mammalian genome.
