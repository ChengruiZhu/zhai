Meiosis is a specialized form of cell division that ensures production of germ cells with the right number of chromosomes, so that at fertilization the embryo receives complete sets of paternal and maternal chromosomes. The accurate distribution of chromosomes during cell divisions is dependent on a ring-shaped protein complex called cohesin. Cohesin is thought to embrace the chromosomes from the time of their duplication during S-phase until their segregation in the ensuing division. This segregation is facilitated by the controlled proteolytic cleavage of one of the cohesin ring components. Most eukaryotes express specialized variants of this protein: for mitosis the variant Rad21/Scc1/Mcd1 and for meiosis the related protein Rec8. Because Drosophila lacks a clear Rec8 homolog, we have analyzed in the present study whether the mitotic variant Rad21 may also function during meiosis. We have destroyed Rad21-based cohesin by premature cleavage of an engineered Rad21 variant during oogenesis. While we find no indication for effects on the accuracy of meiotic chromosome segregation, Rad21 cleavage results in a premature disassembly of the synaptonemal complex (SC), a structure required for meiotic recombination in Drosophila oocytes. Our interaction studies provide intriguing hints how Rad21 might contribute to SC maintenance.
