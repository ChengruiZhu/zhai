We investigated T-T cell interactions in the suppression of contact sensitivity. Suppressor cells that block the efferent limb of sensitivity (Ts-eff) can inhibit the passive transfer of contact sensitivity mediated by 1-fluoro-2,4-dinitrobenzene immune cells (T DH). But, Ts-eff cannot block the passive transfer of TDH which comes from cyclophosphamide (Cy) pretreated sensitized mice. We interpret these results to indicate that lymph node cells from sensitized mice contain not only TDH but also another intermediate cell which is required for the suppression of TDH by Ts-eff. This intermediate cell is sensitive to cyclophosphamide and requires antigen activation for its development. It is sensitive to adult thymectomy and anti-brain associated theta serum and is therefore designated as an auxiliary T- suppressor cell (Ts-aux). It is not sensitive to splenectomy and it carries I-J determinants. Ts-aux are required for the activity of suppressors of the efferent limb (Ts-eff) but not of suppressors of the afferent limb (Ts-aff). Thus, in the feedback loops in contact sensitivity, the generation of Tdh is coordinated with the development of auxiliary Ts which are essential for the suppression of those TDH.
