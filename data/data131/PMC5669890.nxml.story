Administration of chemoradiation before tumor resection has revolutionized the management of locally advanced rectal cancer, but many patients have proven resistant to this preoperative therapy. Our group recently reported a negative correlation between c-Myc gene expression and this resistance. In the present study, integrated analysis of miRNA and mRNA expression profiles was conducted in 45 pre-treatment rectal tumors in order to analyze the expressions of miRNAs and c-Myc and their relationship with clinicopathological factors and patient survival. Twelve miRNAs were found to be differentially expressed by responders and non-responders to the chemoradiation. Functional classification revealed an association between the differentially expressed miRNAs and c-Myc. Quantitative real-time PCR results showed that miRNA-148 and miRNA-375 levels were both significantly lower in responders than in non-responders. Notably, a significant negative correlation was found between miRNA-375 expression and c-Myc expression. According to these findings, miRNA-375 and its targeted c-Myc may be useful as a predictive biomarker of the response to neoadjuvant treatment in patients with locally advanced rectal cancer.
