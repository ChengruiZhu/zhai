U16-binding protein 4 (ULBP4), a human ligand for natural killer group 2, member D (NKG2D) receptor on NK cells and subsets of T cells, is thought to activate anticancer immune responses. However, the expression pattern and prognostic effect of ULBP4 in nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) has not been investigated. We first compared ULBP4 expression between archival 15 NPC tissues and 8 normal nasopharynx (NP) tissues using qPCR. Then ULBP4 expression among 111 NPC specimens was validated on immunohistochemical examination. In addition, the association of ULBP4 expression with clinical characteristics and survival outcomes was analyzed. Furthermore, the impact of ULBP4 expression in NPC cells on the cytotoxic activity of NK cells was investigated. Both mRNA and protein ULBP4 expressions of NPC tissues were significantly lower than those in normal NP tissues. However, no association of ULBP4 expression with clinical characteristics was observed. Patients with NPC having decreased expression of UBLP4 had significantly poorer overall survival (OS), progression-free survival (PFS), and distant metastasis-free survival (DMFS) than those with preserved levels of ULBP4. On multivariate analyses, low expression of ULBP4 was of borderline significance for OS, PFS, and DMFS (
