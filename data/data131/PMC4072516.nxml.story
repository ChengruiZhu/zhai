Most of a typical mammalian genome is occupied by transposable elements, which have played an important role in shaping these genomes, and L1s account for approximately half of this transposable element load. Mammals have evolved several mechanisms to control L1 retrotransposition, and yet L1s remain active in almost all mammalian lineages. However, L1s were found to have gone extinct in the megabat family âˆ¼24 million years ago. We were able to trace megabat L1s to the ancestral L1 families shared by all mammals as well as identify bat-specific L1 families. Unlike most well-characterized mammals which have a single active L1 lineage, multiple L1 lineages have persisted in megabats throughout their evolutionary history. When the L1 extinction occurred in megabats, two active lineages lost their ability to retrotranspose almost simultaneously after a burst of activity. We synthesized the L1 from the most active family at the time of extinction and found a long intergenic spacer between its two protein coding genes. Tissue culture assays of the reconstructed megabat L1 revealed that both genes supported retrotransposition, but that the spacer is inhibitory. Despite the inhibition, this family accounted for 18% of the L1s detected in the megabat genome.
