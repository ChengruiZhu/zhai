Copy-number variants (CNVs) are deletions and duplications of DNA segments, responsible for most of the genome variation in mammals. To help elucidate the impact of CNVs on evolution and function, we provide a high-resolution CNV map of the largest gene superfamily in humans, i.e., the olfactory receptor (OR) gene superfamily. Our map reveals twice as many olfactory CNVs per person than previously reported, indicating considerable OR dosage variations in humans. In particular, our findings indicate that CNVs are specifically enriched among evolutionary “young” ORs, some of which originated following the human-chimpanzee split, implying that CNVs may play an important role in the gene-birth and gene-loss processes that continuously shape the human OR repertoire. Furthermore, we describe 15 OR gene loci showing frequent human-specific deletion alleles. Additionally, we present evidence for a recent non-allelic homologous recombination event involving a pair of OR genes, forming a novel fusion OR that may harbor novel odorant-binding properties. Such events may potentially relate to individual functional “holes” in the human smell-detection repertoire, and future studies will address the specific chemosensory impact of our genomic variation map.
