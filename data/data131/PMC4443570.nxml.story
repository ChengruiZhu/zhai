Surgical manipulation of the cervical vascular bundle during neck surgery may promote a thromboembolic event. We evaluated if thyroid surgery is associated with any alterations in the carotid artery wall that would imply an augmented risk of cerebrovascular accident (CVA). A prospective evaluation of a consecutive series of patients who underwent total thyroidectomy was performed. High resolution Doppler ultrasonography (HR-DU) was performed the day before and three days after surgery in asymptomatic consenting patients scheduled for total thyroidectomy. Two hundred patients were recruited. Preoperatively, no hemodynamically significant stenosis (> 70%) was observed. Surgery was delayed in one patient because of asymptomatic subclavian steal syndrome. The remaining 199 patients underwent total thyroidectomy. No modification of preoperative findings was observed at the postoperative HR-DU evaluation. No CVA was observed. In the absence of any significant stenosis, thyroid surgery does not affect the presence and extent of arterial wall disease and the consequent risk of CVA. Thus, screening with HR-DU does not seem beneficial in a generally asymptomatic population without significant risk factors.
