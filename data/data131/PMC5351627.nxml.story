Mancozeb, a mixture of ethylene-bis-dithiocarbamate manganese and zinc salts, is one of the most widely used fungicides in agriculture. Mancozeb could lead to mitochondria dysfunction, cellular anti-oxidation enzymes depletion and apoptotic pathways activation. Previous studies indicated the exposure of mancozeb through mother would lead to irregular estrous cycles, decreased progesterone levels, reduced litter sizes, and more frequent delivery of dead fetuses. In this study, we investigated mancozeb inducing reproductive toxicity, especially focusing on its apoptotic effect and epigenetic modifications. We also showed that resveratrol, a kind of phytoalexin found in peanuts and grapes, can alleviate mancozeb's adverse effects, such as declined fertility, decreased ovary weight and primary follicles. Besides, mancozeb treated oocytes displayed suboptimal developmental competence and this can also be improved by treatment of resveratrol. More detailed investigation of these processes revealed that mancozeb increased reactive oxygen species, causing cell apoptosis and abnormal epigenetic modifications, and resveratrol can block these cytotoxic changes. Collectively, our results showed that resveratrol can alleviate mancozeb induced infertility and this was mainly through the correction of apoptotic tendency and the abnormity of cellular epigenetic modification.
