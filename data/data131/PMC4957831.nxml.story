The cytokinesis machinery that is required for physical separation of mother-daughter cells during mitosis is highly conserved from yeast to humans. In budding yeast, cytokinesis is achieved via timely delivery of cytokinetic enzymes to the division site that eventually triggers the constriction of AMR. It has been previously demonstrated that cytokinesis invariably occurs after the disassembly of the mitotic spindle. Intriguingly, Chs2p that is responsible for laying down the primary septum has been shown to localize to the division site before mitotic spindle disassembly. In this study, we show that mitotic spindle integrity upon sister chromatid separation is dependent on the continuous endocytosis of cytokinetic enzymes. Failure in the internalization of cytokinetic proteins during mitotic exit causes premature AMR constriction that eventually contributes to the shearing of mitotic spindle. Consequently, cells fail to re-establish a bipolar spindle in the subsequent round of cell division cycle. Our findings provide insights into how the levels of secreted proteins at the division site impacts cytokinesis. We believe this regulation mechanism might be conserved in higher eukaryotic cells as a secreted protein, hemicentin, has been shown recently to be involved in regulating cytokinesis in both
