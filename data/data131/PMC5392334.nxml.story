EGFR T790M mutation accounts for about 40-55% drug resistance for the first generation EGFR kinase inhibitors in the NSCLC. Starting from ibrutinib, a highly potent irreversible BTK kinase inhibitor, which was also found to be moderately active to EGFR T790M mutant, we discovered a highly potent irreversible EGFR inhibitor CHMFL-EGFR-26, which is selectively potent against EGFR mutants including L858R, del19, and L858R/T790M. It displayed proper selectivity window between the EGFR mutants and the wide-type. CHMFL-EGFR-26 exhibited good selectivity profile among 468 kinases/mutants tested (S score (1)=0.02). In addition, X-ray crystallography revealed a distinct “DFG-in” and “cHelix-out” inactive binding mode between CHMFL-EGFR-26 and EGFR T790M protein. The compound showed highly potent anti-proliferative efficacy against EGFR mutant but not wide-type NSCLC cell lines through effective inhibition of the EGFR mediated signaling pathway, induction of apoptosis and arresting of cell cycle progression. CHMFL-EGFR-26 bore acceptable pharmacokinetic properties and demonstrated dose-dependent tumor growth suppression in the H1975 (EGFR L858R/T790M) and PC-9 (EGFR del19) inoculated xenograft mouse models. Currently CHMFL-EGFR-26 is undergoing extensive pre-clinical evaluation for the clinical trial purpose.
