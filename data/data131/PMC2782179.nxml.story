Neural development is a process that involves a wide range of behaviors. As a result of these behaviors, neurons are able to extend axons to different brain areas and produce stereotypical patterns of innervation. One of the most commonly studied of these projections is in the visual system, where retinal axons project to multiple brain regions and produce retinotopic maps. This study examines the relative roles and interactions of different neural mechanisms in guiding axon growth and generating retinotopic order. We did this by producing a computational model of retinotopic development that represented many of the neural mechanisms thought to be involved, including axon and synapse growth, molecular guidance and synapse plasticity. Our results suggest that synaptic plasticity is realized by variation in the number of synapses between neurons, not through alteration of individual synaptic weights; that lateral connectivity between collicular neurons is not required for organization; and that axon arbor development does not require the gradient tracking abilities of growth cones. The mechanisms underlying neuronal development in the visual system are also observed in many other brain areas, so the findings here should apply more generally.
