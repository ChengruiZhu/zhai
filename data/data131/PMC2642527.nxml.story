. The phosphorylation of β-catenin (Ser33/37/Thr41) by GSK-3β is known to target β-catenin towards degradation. In line with our findings, the increase in phospho-GSK-3β level was accompanied by a significant decrease in β-catenin phosphorylation (Ser33/37/Thr41) and accumulation of β-catenin protein. The knockdown of AURKA reversed the phosphorylation of GSK-3β and the β-catenin protein levels. The immunofluorescence analysis demonstrated co-localization of AURKA and GSK-3β proteins and a significant increase in the nuclear β-catenin levels in cells overexpressing AURKA. The β-catenin/TCF transcription activity was measured using the pTopFlash and its mutant pFopFlash luciferase reporter vectors. Indeed, AURKA over-expression led to a significant increase in the pTopFlash reporter activity, whereas kinase dead AURKA mutant (D274A) had no effect. Consistent with these findings, we detected a significant mRNA up-regulation of several direct targets of the β-catenin/TCF transcription complex (cyclin D1, c-MYC, c-MYC binding protein, CLDN1, FGF18, and VEGF), and a two-fold increase in the proliferation rate in AURKA over-expressing cells. We conclude that the AURKA/GSK-3β interaction plays an important role in regulating β-catenin, underscoring a novel oncogenic potential for AURKA in gastric tumorigenesis.
