The proliferation of antigen-activated T cells is mediated by the T cell-derived growth factor, interleukin 2 (IL-2). The biochemical signaling cascades initiating IL-2-induced growth are dependent upon protein tyrosine kinase (PTK) activity. One IL-2-regulated PTK implicated in this cascade is the Src-family kinase, Fyn. Previous studies have described a physical association between Fyn and a potential downstream substrate, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3- kinase) as well as the IL-2-dependent activation of PI3-kinase in T cells; however, the role of Fyn in IL-2-induced PI3-kinase activation remains unclear. In this report, we demonstrate that IL-2 stimulation triggers tyrosine phosphorylation of the p85 subunit of PI3-kinase in the murine T cell line, CTLL-2. Lysates prepared from growth factor- deprived and IL-2-stimulated T cells reconstituted both the binding of CTLL-2 cell-derived Fyn to and the IL-2-inducible tyrosine phosphorylation of exogenously added recombinant p85. Furthermore, overexpression of wild-type Fyn in these cells enhanced both the basal and IL-2-mediated activation of PI3-kinase. Additional studies of the Fyn-PI3-kinase interaction demonstrated that the Src homology 3 (SH3) domain of Fyn constitutes a direct binding site for the p85 subunit of PI3-kinase. These results support the notion that Fyn may be directly involved in the activation of the downstream signaling enzyme, PI3- kinase, in IL-2-stimulated T cells.
