We recently reported a novel neuro-immuno co-operation between vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) and fraktalkine (FKN) in recruiting human mast cells to the asthmatic airway that provided a classical example of priming effect on mast cells migratory function, but the role of the F-actin in human mast cell chemotaxisâ€™ priming is poorly defined. Therefore the aim of this study was to further investigate the biophysical role of the cytoskeletal element; the F-actin, intracellular reorganization and its polymerization in mast cell priming of chemotaxis function. In the present communication it is shown by immunofluoresence confocal microscopy analysis that physical F-actin intracellular reorganization in a membrane bound manner on human mast cell is involved in VIP-induced priming of human mast cell chemotaxis against FKN. The F-actin reorganization was calcium independent and without modification of its contents as assessed by fluorescence-activated cell scanning analysis. These results identify a novel role for the biophysical association of F-actin in the crosstalk between neuro-inflammatory mediators and mast cells and may be an important target for therapeutic modalities in allergic inflammation.
