The dilated cardiomyopathy is the common type of cardiomyopathy, and its distinctive characteristic is the systolic dysfunction. Not many reports were issued about the efficacy of cardiac rehabilitation in patients with an advanced dilated cardiomyopathy until yet. A 50-year-old man who was diagnosed with dilated cardiomyopathy with congestive heart failure was admitted to the emergency room after a sudden collapse and a ventricular fibrillation was presented in the actual electrocardiogram. After three months, the patient participated in an 8-week cardiac rehabilitation program with electrocardiogram monitoring for 50 minutes per session at five times per week. The maximal oxygen consumption improved from 13.5 to 19.4 mL/kg/min during this time. At 3.9 metabolic equivalents, the myocardial oxygen demand decreased from 21,710 to 12,669 mmHg.bpm and the Borg's scale of perceived exertion decreased from 15 to 9. The left ventricular ejection fraction improved from 14% to 19%. So in this case report will be presented a patient after a successful cardiac rehabilitation program. Before this the patient suffered from a much more advanced dilated cardiomyopathy and was resuscitated from cardiac arrest.
