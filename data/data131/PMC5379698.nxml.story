The study was designed to test the hypothesis that acute hyperglycemia diminishes the cardioprotective effects following a 20-min pre-ischemic pre-conditioning with insulin in the isolated rat heart using the Langendorff system. Forty hearts were assigned to receive modified Krebs–Henseleit (KH) buffer containing 0.5 U/L insulin and 100 mg/dL glucose (InsG100, n = 10), KH buffer with 100 mg/dL glucose (G100, n = 10), KH buffer supplemented with 0.5 U/L insulin and 600 mg/dL glucose (InsG600, n = 10), or with 600 mg/dL glucose (G600, n = 10). To match the osmotic pressure of the InsG600 group, 27.5 mmol/L of mannitol was added to KH solution in the InsG100 and G100 group. The four groups were perfused with each solution for 20 min prior to 15 min of no-flow ischemia, and during 20 min of reperfusion. Only during the ischemic period the heart was paced at 222 beats/min. Measurements of heart rate, coronary flow and maximum of LV derivative of pressure development (dP/dt max) were recorded. Myocardial phospho-protein kinase B (p-Akt) and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) levels were assayed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and sandwich ELISA, respectively following reperfusion.
