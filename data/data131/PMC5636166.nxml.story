Most complex traits and diseases are regulated by the combined influence of multiple genetic variants. However, it remains controversial whether these genetic variants independently influence complex traits, and therefore the impact of each variant could be simply added together (additivity), or whether the variants work together to influence trait variation, in which case the combined impact of multiple variants would differ from the summed impact of each individual variant (epistasis). In this study in mice, we discovered that the genetic regulation of blood sugar levels and gene expression in the liver were predominantly controlled by non-additive interactions, whereas body weight was predominantly controlled by additive interactions. Remarkably, the expression level of nearly 25% of all genes in the liver was controlled by non-additive interactions. The non-additive interactions typically acted to return trait values to the levels detected in control mice, thus contributing to a reduction in trait variation. We also demonstrated that not accounting for non-additive interactions significantly underestimated the phenotypic effect of a genetic variant on a particular genetic background, suggesting that many previously identified risk loci may have significantly larger effects on disease susceptibility in a subset of individuals. These studies highlight the importance of understanding interactions between genetic variants to better understand disease risk and personalize clinical care.
