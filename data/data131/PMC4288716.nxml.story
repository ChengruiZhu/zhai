In recent years, much research in molecular and developmental biology has been devoted to unravelling the mechanisms that govern the development of living systems. This includes the identification of key molecular networks that control shape formation and their response to hormonal regulation. However, a key challenge now is to understand how these signals, which arise at cellular scale, are physically translated into growth at organ scale, and how these shape changes feed back into molecular regulation systems. To address this question, we developed a computational framework to model the mechanics of 3D tissues during growth at cellular resolution. In our approach, gene regulation is related to tissue mechanical properties through a constitutive tensorial growth equation. Our computational system makes it possible to integrate this equation in both space and time over the growing multicellular structure in close to interactive time. We demonstrate the interest of such a framework to study morphogenesis by constructing a model of flower development, showing how regulation of regional identities can, by dynamically modulating the mechanical properties of cells, lead to realistic shape development.
