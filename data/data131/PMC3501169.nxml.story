All cellular processes depend on the expression and repression of the right sets of genes at the right time. As each cell contains the same DNA, transcriptional and epigenetic factors have to maintain tight control over gene expression. Even a small divergence from the correct transcriptional program can lead to severe defects and even death. Having deciphered the complete linear genetic information, we need to clarify how this information is organized into the dynamic and highly heterogeneous three-dimensional space of the eukaryotic cell nucleus. Observations on the higher order organization of DNA into differentiated condensation levels date back to the early twentieth century, and potential implications of these structural features to gene expression were postulated shortly after. In particular, proximity of genes to condensed regions of heterochromatin was proposed to negatively influence their expression and, henceforward, the concept of heterochromatin as subnuclear silencing compartment emerged. Methodological advances fueled a flurry of recent studies, which only, in part, led support to this concept. In this review, we address how (hetero)chromatin structure and proximity might influence gene expression and discuss the challenges and means to unravel this fundamental biological question.
