Around 47â€“74% of patients with hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT) have hepatic vascular malformations (HVMs); magnetic resonance images (MRI) of the central nervous system (CNS) might show in T1 sequences a hyper-intensity signal in different areas, mainly in the basal ganglia (BG) as consequence of manganese (Mn) deposits as observed in cirrhotic patients. These patients might suffer from different neuropsychiatric disorders (hepatic encephalopathy). In HHT patients, even in the presence of hepatic shunts, hepatocellular function is usually preserved. Additionally, Mn shares iron absorption mechanisms, transferrin and CNS transferrin receptors. In iron deficiency conditions, the Mn may harbor transferrin and access BG. The objectives were to describe frequency of BG Mn deposit-induced lesions (BGMnIL) in HHT patients, its relationship with iron deficiency anemia (IDA) and HVMs. Finally, explore the association between neuropsychological and motor consequences. We performed a cross-sectional study. We determined HHT patients with or without BG-MnIL by the MRI screening of the CNS. We included all patients with lesions and a random sample of those without lesions. All patients underwent standardized and validated neuropsychological assessment to evaluate BG actions. Results were analyzed with multiple logistic regression, adjusting for potential confounders.
