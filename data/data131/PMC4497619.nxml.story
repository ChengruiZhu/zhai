For complex human diseases, identifying the genes harboring susceptibility variants has taken on medical importance. Disease-associated genes provide clues for elucidating disease etiology, predicting disease risk, and highlighting therapeutic targets. Here, we develop a method to predict whether a given gene and disease are associated. To capture the multitude of biological entities underlying pathogenesis, we constructed a heterogeneous network, containing multiple node and edge types. We built on a technique developed for social network analysis, which embraces disparate sources of data to make predictions from heterogeneous networks. Using the compendium of associations from genome-wide studies, we learned the influential mechanisms underlying pathogenesis. Our findings provide a novel perspective about the existence of pervasive pleiotropy across complex diseases. Furthermore, we suggest transcriptional signatures of perturbations are an underutilized resource amongst prioritization approaches. For multiple sclerosis, we demonstrated our ability to prioritize future studies and discover novel susceptibility genes. Researchers can use these predictions to increase the statistical power of their studies, to suggest the causal genes from a set of candidates, or to generate evidence-based experimental hypothesis.
