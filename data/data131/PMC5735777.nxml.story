The prevalence of any AMD ranged from 2.44% (95% CI = 1.85–3.22) in people aged 45–49 years to 18.98% (95% CI = 15.05–23.66) in people aged 85–89 years. Prevalence of early AMD ranged from 1.79% (95% CI = 1.05–3.02) to 10.05% (95% CI = 6.17–15.97), and, in the case of late AMD, from 0.38% (95% CI = 0.16–0.97) to 3.88% (95% CI = 1.68–9.13). In late AMD, the prevalence of geographic atrophy (GA) was 0.15% (95% CI = 0.05–0.47) in people aged 45–49 years and 1.09% (95% CI = 0.35–3.36) in those aged 85–89 years, and the prevalence of neovascular AMD (NVAMD) ranged between 0.24% (95% CI = 0.11–0.50) and 2.79% (95% CI = 1.33–5.77). The number of people with any AMD was 12.01 million (95% CI = 9.29–15.46) in 1990 and 26.65 million (95% CI = 20.62–34.27) in 2015. Within the same period, the number of people with early AMD increased from 9.44 million (95% CI = 7.74–11.15) to 20.91 million (95% CI = 17.16–24.68), and those with late AMD rose from 2.58 million (95% CI = 1.56–4.30) to 5.74 million (95% CI = 3.46–9.59). In late AMD, the number of people living with GA ranged from 0.87 million (95% CI = 0.40–1.83) in 1990 to 1.93 million (95% CI = 0.89–4.08) in 2015, and NVAMD from 1.71 million (95% CI = 1.16–2.47) to 3.81 million (95% CI = 2.57–5.51). The projected number of people with any AMD in 2020 is 31.23 million (95% CI = 24.18–40.14), increasing to 55.19 million (95% CI = 43.04–70.30) in 2050. Between different regions, the South Central owed the most AMD cases (5.50 million in 2000 and 7.52 million in 2010), whereas the North–West China the least (0.66 million in 2000 and 0.95 million in 2010).
