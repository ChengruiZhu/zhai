How cells diverge from a common progenitor and adopt specific fates is still poorly understood. We analyzed gene expression profiles in the distinct cell lineages of the gonad over the period when sex determination occurs. The undifferentiated progenitor cells expressed genes characteristic of both sexual fates, explaining the plasticity of the gonadal cells to differentiate as male or female cell types. The establishment of sex-specific fate in both the germ cells and somatic cells involved activation of some genes; but, importantly, we show that an active repression of genes associated with the alternative pathway is also a characteristic of cell fate commitment. Although germ cell progenitors expressed genes associated with both possible fates, genes characteristic of the male fate were over-represented in the progenitors, giving them a male bias. However, in somatic cell progenitors, which control sex determination, genes associated with the female fate were over-represented. These results suggest an explanation for why the female fate is the developmental default for the gonad, and they advance our understanding of how complex transcriptional networks regulate fate determination during organ development.
