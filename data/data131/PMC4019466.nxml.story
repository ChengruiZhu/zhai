Ribosomes are the cellular machines responsible for all protein synthesis. In eukaryotes, the assembly of ribosomes from their protein and RNA components is extremely complicated and involves more than 200 nonribosomal factors—three times the number of proteins in the mature complex. Among these factors, the Fap7 protein is particularly intriguing because it interacts with the small subunit ribosomal protein Rps14 and it exhibits adenylate kinase activity—a molecular function more commonly associated with regulating ATP/ADP levels than assembling protein–RNA complexes. Combining structural and biochemical analysis of the Rps14–Fap7 complex, we show that Fap7 uses protein side chains to mimic RNA contacts, rendering the interaction of Rps14 with ribosomal RNA or with Fap7 competitive and mutually exclusive. Once bound, Rps14 blocks the substrate-binding cavity of Fap7, and ATP hydrolysis will then break the Fap7–Rps14 complex apart. At the same time, the ribosome structure at the location where Rps14 binds is disrupted when the Fap7/Rps14 complex is formed, and this process is regulated by ATP binding and hydrolysis. Our model is thus that Fap7 temporarily removes Rps14 from the ribosome to enable a conformational change of the ribosomal RNA that is needed for the final maturation step of the small ribosomal subunit.
