Large volumes of data generated by research laboratories coupled with the required effort and cost of curation present a significant barrier to inclusion of these data in authoritative community databases. Further, many publicly funded experimental observations remain invisible to curation simply because they are never published: results often do not fit within the scope of a standard publication; trainee-generated data are forgotten when the experimenter (e.g. student, post-doc) leaves the lab; results are omitted from science narratives due to publication bias where certain results are considered irrelevant for the publication. While authors are in the best position to curate their own data, they face a steep learning curve to ensure that appropriate referential tags, metadata, and ontologies are applied correctly to their observations, a task sometimes considered beyond the scope of their research and other numerous responsibilities. Getting researchers to adopt a new system of data reporting and curation requires a fundamental change in behavior among all members of the research community. To solve these challenges, we have created a novel scholarly communication platform that captures data from researchers and directly delivers them to information resources via
