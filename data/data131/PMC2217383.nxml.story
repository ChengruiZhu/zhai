 or Anx4 alone and were reversible with EDTA. Measurements of membrane fluidity made by monitoring fluorescence anisotropy of 2-(12-(7-nitrobenz-2-oxa-1,3-diazol-4-yl)amino)dodecanoyl-1-hexadecanoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (NBD-HPC) demonstrated that Anx4 binding rigidified the outer leaflet of the bilayer (P < 0.001), thus providing a molecular explanation for the inhibition of water flux. To determine whether Anx4 would produce similar effects on physiological membranes we constructed liposomes which recapitulated the lipid composition of the inner leaflet of the MDCK apical membrane. These membranes exhibited reductions to water permeability upon Anx4 binding (19.5% at 25째C, 31% at 37째C; P < 0.01 and P < 0.001, respectively) and to proton permeability (15% at 25째C, 19.5% at 37째C; P < 0.05). Since our in vitro experiments indicated an effect on membrane permeability, we examined localization of Anx4 in the kidney collecting duct, a region of the nephron responsible for concentrating urine through water reabsorbtion. Anx4 was shown to colocalize apically with aquaporin 2 (AQP2) in collecting duct epithelia. To test for the existence of a functional interaction between Anx4 and AQP2 we isolated AQP2-containing endosomes and exposed them to Anx4/Ca
