), worker bees can lay eggs produced by an abnormal form of meiotic cell division known as thelytoky. These eggs are produced asexually and develop into female worker bees, which are then able to reproduce in the same way and hence to propagate this trait. Cape bee workers also display a variety of characteristics that enable them to invade foreign colonies, reproduce and feed off their resources, a behavior known as social parasitism. The genetic basis of these traits is unknown. Here we compare whole genome sequences of Cape bees with other honeybee subspecies and identify the genes that likely control this reproductive strategy. Although Cape bees are extremely genetically similar to other African bees, we identify genetic variants that make it possible to unambiguously distinguish them. In contrast to previous studies, our results suggest that multiple genes are involved in social parasitism, including those involved in hormonal signaling that may cause worker bees to activate their ovaries and those involved in chromosomal segregation, which may cause the switch between normal meiosis and thelytoky. Our results give insights into how genetic variants that facilitate asexual reproduction are able to invade a sexually reproducing population.
