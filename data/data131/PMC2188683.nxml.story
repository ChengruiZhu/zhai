The generation of lipoxygenase products of arachidonic acid is considered an important event in inflammation. This study demonstrates the levels of both lipoxins and leukotrienes (LTC4, LTD4, LTB4, and omega-oxidized LTB4) generated from endogenous sources of arachidonate by PMN primed with recombinant human granulocyte/macrophage colony- stimulating factor and in coincubations with platelets (1:1 to 1:100 ratio). Upon exposure to receptor-mediated stimuli (FMLP and thrombin), the levels of lipoxins generated were within the range of both LTB4 and LTC4. Co-incubation of [1-14C]arachidonate-labeled platelets with primed polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMN) followed by addition of thrombin and FMLP led to the formation of both 5- and 15-LO products that carried 14C label. Thus, in addition to the transcellular conversion of LTA4 to platelet-derived lipoxins and LTC4, PMN can use platelet-derived arachidonate to generate lipoxygenase products. These results are the first to document the relationship between the levels of lipoxins and leukotrienes generated by receptor-mediated activation of cytokineprimed PMN interacting with platelets. Moreover, they indicate that PMN-platelet interactions utilize bidirectional transcellular routes to contribute to lipoxin formation.
