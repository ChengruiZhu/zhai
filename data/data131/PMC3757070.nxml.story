The popular sparse coding theory posits that the receptive fields of visual cortical neurons maximize the efficiency of the neural representation of natural images. Models implementing this idea typically minimize a combination of the error in reconstructing natural images from neural activities, and the average level of activity in the model neurons. In simulations, these models are presented with natural images and the RFs then develop so as to increase representation efficiency. After a long developmental period, the model RFs typically agree well with those observed experimentally in visual cortex. Since the models seek to minimize (for a given level of reconstruction error) the neural activity levels, the average levels of neural activity might be expected to decrease as the models develop. In the developing mammalian cortex, visual RFs are also modified during development, so the sparse coding hypothesis might appear to suggest that activity levels should decrease during development. Recent experiments with young ferrets show the opposite trend: mature animals tend to have more active visual cortices. Herein, we demonstrate that, depending on the models' initial conditions, some sparse coding models can exhibit increasing activity levels while learning the same types of RFs that are observed in visual cortex: the developmental data do not preclude sparse coding.
