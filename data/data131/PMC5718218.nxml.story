 ionization chamber placed inside in a specially designed phantom at various depths and distances from the imaging field edges. The peripheral dose at reference point inside the phantom was measured with the same ionization chamber to investigate the linearity between MUs used for MV‐CBCT imaging and the PD. The peripheral surface doses at the anterior, lateral, and posterior of the phantom at various distances from the imaging field edge were also measured with thermoluminescent dosimeters (TLDs). Seven nasopharyngeal carcinoma patients were selected and scanned before treatment with head–neck protocol, and the peripheral surface doses were measured with TLDs placed on the anterior, lateral, and posterior surfaces at the axial plane of 15 cm distance from the field edge. The measured peripheral doses data in the phantom were utilized to estimate the peripheral OAR dose. Peripheral dose from MV‐CBCT imaging increased with increasing number of MUs used for imaging protocol and with increasing the imaging field size. The measured peripheral doses in the phantom decreased as distance from the imaging field edges increased. PD also decreased as the depth from the phantom surface increased. For the patient PD measurements, the anterior, lateral, and posterior surface doses of 15 cm distance from the field edge were
