Human eggs (oocytes) are exceptionally prone to the erroneous acquisition of too few (monosomy) or too many (trisomy) chromosomes during development (meiosis). In fact, this type of instability, termed aneuploidy, represents the most common genetic cause of miscarriage in pregnant women (i.e. trisomy 16) and developmental delay in newborns (i.e. Down syndrome from trisomy 21). Although aneuploidy has become a growing problem for women as they delay childbearing into the late thirties, the underlying molecular etiology remains unknown. Since telomere DNA is known to protect the ends of chromosomes from degradation during cell division and is associated with aneuploidy in cancer cells in adults, we tested whether telomere DNA plays a role in aneuploidy development in human oocytes and embryos (where aneuploidy is much more common). We demonstrate that telomere DNA deficiency is indeed associated with aneuploidy in oocytes and early preimplantation (cleavage) stage embryos. This association is reversed upon development to late preimplantation (blastocyst) stage embryos as a result of telomere DNA elongation. These results indicate that telomere DNA deficiency may cause inappropriate chromosome segregation during human oocyte cell division (meiosis) and may serve as a marker for oocytes and embryos that lack the ability to produce healthy children.
