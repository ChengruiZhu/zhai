Using these techniques, the researchers included 18 trials involving 7,446 adults with CKD in their analysis. All included trials evaluated cinacalcet (at a dose of 30 mg to 180 mg/day) and how this drug compared to conventional therapy or conventional therapy plus placebo. The researchers found that, compared to placebo or no treatment, in high-quality evidence, cinacalcet had little or no effect on all-cause mortality (relative risk [RR], 0.97) for people in the final stage of CKD (stage 5D) and unclear effects on all-cause mortality in low-quality evidence for people in the less severe stages (stages 3–5) of CKD (RR, 0.29). Cinacalcet also had uncertain effects on cardiovascular mortality for participants with CKD stage 5D (RR, 0.67) and CKD stages 3–5 (RR, 0.29), and also its role in fracture prevention was unclear in people with CKD stage 5D. Furthermore, cinacalcet had significant side effects, such as increased risk of hypocalcemia (RR, 7.38), nausea (RR, 2.05), vomiting (RR, 1.95), and diarrhea (RR, 1.15), but reduced the risk of hypercalcemia (RR, 0.23). The researchers found that in high-quality evidence, cinacalcet prevented surgical parathyroidectomy in people with CKD stage 5D (RR, 0.49). However, overall, they also found that, on average, routinely treating 1,000 people with cinacalcet for one year has no effect on mortality, prevents about three people from experiencing surgical parathyroidectomy, and leads to approximately 60 and 150 people experiencing hypocalcemia and nausea, respectively.
