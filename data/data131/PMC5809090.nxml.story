Assembling the brain circuitry responsible for our sense of olfaction is a formidable task. The sensory neurons that detect odorants in the nasal epithelium, the olfactory sensory neurons, choose to express a single odorant receptor from a large gene repertoire. Sensory neurons that choose a particular odorant receptor are intermixed with other neurons that have chosen different receptors. Remarkably, all the sensory neurons that choose a particular odorant receptor project axons to the same target region in the brain, while those choosing to express other odorant receptors project axons to different target regions. Presumably, this specificity in axon targeting is related to the differential expression of guidance related genes in subsets of sensory neurons. Is there a systematic method for their identification? Here we use single-cell RNAseq to characterize the transcriptional profiles of individual olfactory sensory neurons. We identify candidate guidance related genes whose expression is correlated to the simultaneous expression of particular odorant receptors. We show in loss of function studies that some of these guidance related genes are required for the guidance of specific subsets of olfactory sensory neurons. This general approach may open the door to the systematic identification of genes that guide axons to their specific targets during the assembly of developing neural circuits.
