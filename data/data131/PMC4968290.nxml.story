We identified 8,267 hip arthroscopy cases from 1998-2012 performed by 295 surgeons in 137 different surgical centers. Demographics revealed that 46.1% of patients were male, with 80.2% carrying private insurance. Annual hip arthroscopy rates increased 88-fold over the observation period, with a 750% increase over the last 10 years. Revision surgery (scope or arthroplasty) was required in 1,087 cases (13.1%) at a mean of 622 ± 603 days. More specifically, revision hip arthroscopy was required in 310 cases (3.8%) at a mean of 649 ± 586 days after the index procedure, while conversion to either resurfacing or THA was required in 796 (9.7%) cases at an average of 616 ± 616 days. The 30-day complication rate, excluding revision surgery, was 0.2%, while the 90-day complication rate was 0.3%. Thirty-day all-cause re-admission rate was 0.7%. Regression analysis revealed that age > 50 y.o. was associated with increased risk of re-operation (Hazard Ratio[HR] 2.30; CI 2.02-2.62), while males carried a slightly lower risk of re-operation (HR 0.88, CI 0.78 -1.0). Additionally, increased surgical volume, for both surgeon and center (≥75th percentile of annual cases), resulted in a lower risk of re-operation (HR 0.64; CI 0.53-0.77; HR 0.61; CI 0.51-0.73).
