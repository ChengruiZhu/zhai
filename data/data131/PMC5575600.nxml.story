Our research has identified several examples in which reduced VEGF-A binding to deficient vascular extracellular matrix leads to deficits in tumor vascularization and tumor growth: (1) germline ablation of collagen VI in the stroma of intracranial B16F10 melanomas; (2) knockdown of the Tks5 scaffolding protein in MDA-MB-231 mammary tumor cells; (3) germline ablation of NG2 proteoglycan in the stroma of MMTV-PyMT mammary tumors; and (4) myeloid-specific ablation of NG2 in the stroma of intracranial B16F10 melanomas. Tumor hypoxia is increased in each of the four types of experimental mice, accompanied by increases in total VEGF-A. However, while VEGF-A is highly associated with tumor blood vessels in control mice, it is much more diffusely distributed in tumors in all four sets of experimental mice, likely due to reduced extent of the vascular extracellular matrix. In parallel to lost VEGF-A localization, tumor vessels in each case have smaller diameters and are leakier than tumor vessels in control mice. Tumor growth is decreased as a result of this poor vascular function. The fact that the observed vascular changes occur in the absence of alterations in vascular density suggests that examination of vessel structure and function is more useful than vascular density for understanding the importance of angiogenesis in tumor progression.
