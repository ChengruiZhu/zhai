Leptin is a peptide that plays a key role in the control of satiety, energy expenditure, food intake and various reproductive processes. In the last years, the expression of leptin had been found in malignant cells of various origins. The aim of this study is to evaluate leptin expression in human laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) and to investigate its possible role in predicting prognosis. Leptin expression was determined by immunohistochemistry in pathological and healthy tissue specimens from 24 patients with laryngeal SCC. Specimens were stained with an anti-leptin antibody. All measurements were performed using a computer-based image analysis system and scale of staining intensity was determined. All tumoural specimens showed significant immunoreactivity for leptin compared to healthy tissues (p ≤ 0.05), but showed different immunoreactivity that was related to clinicopathological features. High leptin expression was not significantly related with TNM, histological grading (HG) or advanced (III and IV) clinical stage (p > 0.05). Recurrence of malignancy was found to be significantly related with high expression of leptin by Spearman's rank correlation test (r = 0.59; p = 0.002), Fisher's test (p = 0.017) and Kaplan- Meier product-limit estimate (Log-rank test, p ≤ 0.05). In particular, multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that recurrences were significantly related with nodal involvement, HG and leptin expression (p ≤ 0.05). These preliminary results suggest that leptin may be a valuable parameter for predicting prognosis in laryngeal SCC.
