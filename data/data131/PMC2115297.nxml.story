We have found that the spontaneous migration of bovine aortic endothelial cells from the edge of a denuded area in a confluent monolayer is dependent upon the release of endogenous basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF). Cell movement is blocked by purified polyclonal rabbit IgG to bFGF as well as affinity purified anti-bFGF IgG and anti- bFGF F(ab')2 fragments. The inhibitory effect of the immunoglobulins is dependent upon antibody concentration, is reversible, is overcome by the addition of recombinant bFGF, and is removed by affinity chromatography of the antiserum through a column of bFGF-Sepharose. Cell movement is also reversibly inhibited by the addition of protamine sulfate and suramin; two agents reported to block bFGF binding to its receptor. The addition of recombinant bFGF to wounded monolayers accelerates the movement of cells into the denuded area. Transforming growth factor beta which has been shown to antagonize several other effects of bFGF also inhibits cell movement. The anti-bFGF IgG prevents the movement of bovine capillary endothelial cells, BHK-21, NIH 3T3, and human skin fibroblasts into a denuded area. Antibodies to bFGF, as well as suramin and protamine sulfate also suppress the basal levels of plasminogen activator and DNA synthesis in bovine aortic endothelial cells.
