Estrogen receptor-negative (ER-) breast cancer is a highly malignant form of breast cancer with poor prognosis. Like most solid tumors, the mortality associated with ER- breast cancer is due to the development of secondary tumors, or metastases, in vital organs distant from the original breast tumor. ER- breast tumors, particularly those also lacking HER (human epidermal growth factor receptor) expression, are particularly deadly because unlike ER+ or HER+ breast cancers, targeted therapies have not yet been developed that can effectively reduce or eliminate tumor cells that have disseminated throughout the patient. Therefore, better understanding of the etiology of metastasis in ER- patients would potentially have a large clinical benefit by providing new targets to eradicate single tumor cells before they develop into metastases. A better understanding of metastasis etiology may also provide methods to prevent the conversion of these disseminated cells into life-threatening lesions. In this study, we demonstrate that a commonly used model of metastatic breast cancer is capable of identifying genes that play a role in the metastatic progression of ER- breast cancers. Furthermore, we identify the circadian rhythm gene,
