 genes are infrequent in human cancers, it remains unclear how these tumour suppressors are eliminated from cancer cells. The protein stability of FOXO3A is regulated by Casein Kinase 1 alpha (CK1α) in an oncogenic RAS-specific manner, but whether this mode of regulation extends to related FOXO family members is unknown. Here we report that CK1α similarly destabilizes FOXO4 in RAS-mutant cells by phosphorylation at serines 265/268. The CK1α-dependent phosphoregulation of FOXO4 is primed, in part, by the PI3K/AKT effector axis of oncogenic RAS signalling. In addition, mutant RAS coordinately elevates proteasome subunit expression and proteolytic activity to eradicate nuclear FOXO4 proteins from RAS-mutant cancer cells. Importantly, dual inhibition of CK1α and the proteasome synergistically inhibited the growth of multiple RAS-mutant human cancer cell lines of diverse tissue origin by blockade of nuclear FOXO4 degradation and induction of caspase-dependent apoptosis. Our findings challenge the current paradigm that nuclear export regulates the proteolysis of FOXO3A/4 tumour suppressors in the context of cancer and illustrates how oncogenic RAS-mediated degradation of FOXOs, via post-translational mechanisms, blocks these important tumour suppressors.
