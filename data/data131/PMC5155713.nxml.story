iPS cells are derived from somatic cells via transduction and expression of selective transcription factors. Both viral-integrating (like retroviral) and non-integrating (like, mRNA or protein-based) techniques are available for the production of iPS cells. In the field of dentistry, iPS cells have been derived from stem cells of apical papilla, dental pulp stem cells, and stem cells from exfoliated deciduous teeth, gingival and periodontal ligament fibroblasts, and buccal mucosa fibroblasts. iPS cells have the potential to differentiate into all derivatives of the 3 primary germ layers i.e. ectoderm, endoderm, and mesoderm. They are autogeneically accessible, and can produce patient-specific or disease-specific cell lines without the issue of ethical controversy. They have been successfully tested to produce mesenchymal stem cells-like cells, neural crest-like cells, ameloblasts-like cells, odontoblasts-like cells, and osteoprogenitor cells. These cells can aid in regeneration of periodontal ligament, alveolar bone, cementum, dentin-pulp complex, as well as possible Biotooth formation. However certain key issues like, epigenetic memory of iPS cells, viral-transduction, tumorgenesis and teratoma formation need to be overcome, before they can be successfully used in clinical practice. The article discusses the sources, pros and cons, and current applications of iPS cells in dentistry with an emphasis on encountered challenges and their solutions.
