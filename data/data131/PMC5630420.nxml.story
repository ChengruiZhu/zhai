IL-17A is an important proinflammatory cytokine which is frequently elevated in tumor microenvironment. However, the role of intratumoral IL-17A in solid tumors remains controversial. Herein, we conducted a meta-analysis to assess the prognostic impact of intratumoral IL-17A in patients with solid tumor. PubMed and EBSCO were searched to identify the studies evaluating the associations between intratumoral IL-17A measured by immunohistochemistry (IHC) and overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS) in solid tumors. A total of 2972 patients with solid tumor from 21 published studies were incorporated into this meta-analysis. We found that high level of intratumoral IL-17A was significantly associated with worse 3-year, 5-year OS and 1-year, 3-year DFS, but not with 1-year OS or 5-year DFS in solid tumors. In addition, in stratified analyses by cancer types, IL-17A overexpression was significantly associated with worse OS in hepatic carcinoma, but with improved OS in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC). Furthermore, high IL-17A expression positively correlated with advanced TNM stage. In conclusion, High expression of intratumoral IL-17A leads to an unfavorable clinical outcome in majority of solid tumors, implicating IL-17A is a valuable biomarker for prognostic prediction of human solid malignances and targeting it may have a potential for effective treatment.
