The human genome has been sequenced, and, intriguingly, less than 2% specifies the information for the basic protein building blocks of our bodies. So, what does the other 98% do? It now appears that the mammalian genome also specifies the instructions for many previously undiscovered “non protein-coding RNA” (ncRNA) genes. However, what these ncRNAs do is largely unknown. In recent years, strategies have been designed that have successfully identified hundreds of short ncRNAs—termed microRNAs—many of which have since been shown to act as genetic regulators. Also known to be functionally important are a handful of ncRNAs orders of magnitude larger in size than microRNAs. The availability of complete genome and comprehensive transcript sequences allows for the systematic discovery of more large ncRNAs. The authors developed a computational strategy to screen the mouse genome and identify large ncRNAs. They detected existing large ncRNAs, thus validating their approach, but, more importantly, discovered more than 60 other candidates, some of which were subsequently confirmed experimentally. This work opens the door to a virtually unexplored world of large ncRNAs and beckons future experimental work to define the cellular functions of these molecules.
