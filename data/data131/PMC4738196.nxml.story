Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is a process by which cancer cells acquire mesenchymal properties, such as induction of vimentin, while epithelial-associated genes like E-cadherin are lost. This enables cells to be more metastatic. Factors that are able to induce EMT include growth factors such as transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) and epidermal growth factor, and transcription factors such as Snail. Snail-induced EMT promotes migration and invasion and we hypothesized that this may be mediated by the activity of urokinase-type plasminogen activator (uPA) and its receptor (uPAR). LNCaP, 22Rv1 and ARCaP human prostate cancer (CaP) cells stably transfected with empty vector control (Neo) or constitutively active Snail exhibited increased cell invasion. Superarray analysis revealed an upregulation in uPA and uPAR RNA expression in Snail-transfected ARCaP cells compared with that of a Neo control. In addition, the protein expression levels of Snail, uPA and uPAR were measured by western blot analysis which showed that overexpression of Snail increased uPA and uPAR protein levels. The activity of uPA in conditioned media was measured using an ELISA which revealed that uPA activity was elevated in LNCaP, 22Rv1 and ARCaP cells overexpressing Snail. Additionally, transient silencing of uPAR in ARCaP cells overexpressing Snail using short interfering RNA resulted in abrogation of Snail-mediated invasion. Snail overexpression was associated with increased extracellular-signal-regulated kinase activity, and antagonism of this activity with mitogen-activated protein (MAPK) inhibitor, UO126, inhibited cell invasion and decreased uPA activity. Therefore, Snail-mediated cell invasion in human CaP cells may occur via the regulation of uPA/uPAR and the MAPK signaling pathway.
