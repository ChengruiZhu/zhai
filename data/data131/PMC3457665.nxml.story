The inflammatory type hepatocellular adenoma (IHCA) is a subtype of HCA which is a benign liver tumor, predominantly occurring in young women in an otherwise normal liver. IHCA contains either a mutation of gp130 or STAT3. Both mutations lead to a similar morphologic phenotype and to increased expression of C-reactive protein (CRP) and/or serum amyloid-A (SAA). IHCA comprised about 40% of all HCAs and is associated with obesity. We investigated the histomorphological and immunophenotypical changes of the nontumorous liver of 32 resected IHCA specimens. Similar types of changes are present in samples taken adjacent to tumor and distant ones. The lobular architecture is well preserved. Mild/moderate steatosis is found in a high frequency which is in accordance with the median BMI of 32 in our cases. Of note are the regular findings of sinusoidal dilatation, single arteries, and minute CRP foci which are all features of HCA. These distinct CRP foci are mostly found in cases of multiple IHCA which indicates that the remnant liver may also contain IHCA foci. These findings show that the nonlesional liver in IHCA does contain abnormalities, and this may have consequences for the followup, especially since it is known that obesity may stimulate malignant growth.
