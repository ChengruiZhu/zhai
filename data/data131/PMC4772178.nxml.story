To evaluate the association between smoking and physician-diagnosed stroke and myocardial infarction, this study used Community Health Survey data from 2009 on 92,082 males over the age of 30 years. Using multiple logistic regression, association index between smoking and physician-diagnosed stroke and myocardial infarction was calculated after adjusting the effects of age, hypertension, and diabetes. The odds ratios (95% confidence interval) of the physician-diagnosed stroke and myocardial infarction in the smoking group were 1.12 (1.02–1.24) and 1.21 (1.06–1.38) compared to the non-smoking group. The values of the physician-diagnosed stroke and myocardial infarction were 0.84 (0.74–0.94) and 0.96 (0.82–1.12) in the current-smoking subgroup, 1.38 (1.24–1.53) and 1.45 (1.26–1.67) in the ex-smoking subgroup, 1.39 (1.18–1.63) and 1.85 (1.53–2.24) in the 10- to 19-year smokers groups, 1.39 (1.22–1.58) and 1.36 (1.15–1.60) in the 30- to 40-year smokers groups, and 0.53 (0.44–0.63) and 0.47 (0.36–0.63) in those who had smoked for over 50 years. These results showed smoking was a risk factor for stroke and myocardial infarction in Korean males. This objective evidence should guide policy-making and public health interventions in the fields of smoking prevention and prohibition.
