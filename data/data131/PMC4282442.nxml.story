 but the underlying mechanisms causing the following resistance to differentiation remain unclear. We investigated the effect of extracellular calcium on the proliferation of HPV16-positive keratinocytes and on the mRNA expression of the viral E6-oncogene. HPV16-positive hypopharyngeal carcinoma cells (UD-SCC-2), spontaneously immortalized- (HMK) and HPV16 E6/E7-immortalized human gingival keratinocytes (IHGK) were grown for 3, 6 and 9 days in Keratinocyte Serum-free Medium with calcium concentrations ranging from 0 mM to 6 mM. Calcium concentrations up to 0.09 mM increased cellular proliferation, which decreased at higher concentrations. A shift of calcium concentration from 0 to 4 mM increased E6 expression in UD-SCC-2 cells 2.4-fold by day 9. Simultaneously, E2 expression increased. The most significant upregulation of E6 and E2 expressions was observed at day 9, grown in high-calcium media and the increase in E6 expression coincided with an increase in involucrin expression, likely indicating cell differentiation. Despite this, HPV-positive cells continued to proliferate even at high-calcium media in contrast to HPV-negative cells. Overexpression of E6 mRNA may be an important feature of HPV16-positive cells to resist the natural calcium gradient in differentiating keratinocytes allowing cell proliferation.
