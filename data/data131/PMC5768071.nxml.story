Lung cancer, a malignant tumor, is the most frequently fatal cancer, with poor survival rates in the advanced stages. In order to improve the understanding of this disease, and to improve the outcomes of patients, additional studies are required. In the present study, differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in patients with lung cancer compared with controls were identified. To understand how these DEGs act together to account for the initiation of lung cancer, a protein interaction network and a transcriptional regulatory network were constructed to explore the clusters and pathways in lung cancer, and the results indicated that PTTG1 and MMP9 served major roles in the development of lung cancer in the regulatory system. Consistent with this, mRNA and protein expression levels of PTTG1 and MMP9 were significantly upregulated in lung cancer tissues compared with normal lung tissues. The overexpression of PTTG1 or MMP9 was induced in the human bronchial epithelial BEAS-2B cell line, indicating that increased PTTG1 or MMP9 alone may not only facilitate cell migration, proliferation and induce colony formation, but also suppress cell apoptosis. In summary, PTTG1 and MMP9 were identified as potential targets for therapeutic intervention through gene therapy in lung cancer.
