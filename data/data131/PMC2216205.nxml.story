In the isolated sensory epithelium of the Plotosus electroreceptor, the receptor current has been dissected into inward Ca current, ICa, and superimposed outward transient of Ca-gated K current, IK(Ca). In control saline (170 mM/liter Na), with IK(Ca) abolished by K blockers, ICa declined in two successive exponential phases with voltage- dependent time constants. Double-pulse experiments revealed that the test ICa was partially depressed by prepulses, maximally near voltage levels for the control ICa maximum, which suggests current-dependent inactivation. In low Na saline (80 mM/liter), ICa declined in a single phase with time constants similar to those of the slower phase in control saline. The test ICa was then unaffected by prepulses. The implied presence of two Ca current components, the fast and slow ICa's, were further examined. In control saline, the PSP externally recorded from the afferent nerve showed a fast peak and a slow tonic phase. The double-pulse experiments revealed that IK(Ca) and the peak PSP were similarly depressed, i.e., secondarily to inactivation of the peak current. The steady inward current, however, was unaffected by prolonged prepulses that were stepped to 0 mV, the in situ DC level. Therefore, the fast ICa seems to initiate IK(Ca) and phasic release of transmitter, which serves for phasic receptor responses. The slow ICa may provide persistent active current, which has been shown to maintain tonic receptor operation.
