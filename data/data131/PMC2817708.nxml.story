Properly folded RNAs are critical for virtually all RNA-mediated processes ranging from feedback regulation of gene expression to RNA maturation. The ability of RNAs to adopt specific structures in living cells is remarkable given their propensity to become trapped in a mixture of stable, misfolded structures in vitro. Using mRNA with an inserted ribozyme and self-cleavage to monitor competition between mutually exclusive structures, we previously showed that upstream structures dominated folding outcomes during RNA synthesis in vitro, suggesting that folding occurs sequentially. However, when studied in vivo upstream and downstream structures blocked ribozyme assembly equally well in yeast, providing evidence that intracellular folding outcomes reflect the relative stability of alternative structures. We find that very stable upstream structures can block assembly of downstream structures in vivo even when the downstream structures are more stable, and that a narrow threshold of stability determines whether folding and unfolding rates or thermodynamic stability govern folding outcomes. Thus, mRNAs fold sequentially in vitro and in vivo but exchange between adjacent structures is faster in vivo than in vitro. Simple RNA structures unfold at similar rates in vivo and in vitro, so exchange between adjacent structures in vivo probably occurs through a distinct, step-wise mechanism that could be facilitated by proteins associated with nascent RNAs.
