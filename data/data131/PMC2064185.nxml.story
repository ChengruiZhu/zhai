Phospholipids play a critical role in the recruitment and activation of several adaptors and effectors during phagocytosis. Changes in lipid metabolism during phagocytosis are restricted to the phagocytic cup, the area of the plasmalemma lining the target particle. It is unclear how specific lipids and lipid-associated molecules are prevented from diffusing away from the cup during the course of phagocytosis, a process that often requires several minutes. We studied the mobility of lipid-associated proteins at the phagocytic cup by measuring fluorescence recovery after photobleaching. Lipid-anchored (diacylated) fluorescent proteins were freely mobile in the unstimulated membrane, but their mobility was severely restricted at sites of phagocytosis. Only probes anchored to the inner monolayer displayed reduced mobility, whereas those attached to the outer monolayer were unaffected. The immobilization persisted after depletion of plasmalemmal cholesterol, ruling out a role of conventional “rafts.” Corralling of the probes by the actin cytoskeleton was similarly discounted. Instead, the change in mobility required activation of tyrosine kinases. We suggest that signaling-dependent recruitment of adaptors and effectors with lipid binding domains generates an annulus of lipids with restricted mobility.
