                    The immune system plays an
                        important role in immunity (immune surveillance), but also in the
                        regulation of tissue homeostasis (immune physiology). Lessons from the
                        female reproductive tract indicate that immune system related cells, such
                        as intraepithelial T cells and monocyte-derived cells (MDC) in stratified
                        epithelium, interact amongst themselves and degenerate whereas epithelial
                        cells proliferate and differentiate. In adult ovaries, MDC and T cells are
                        present during oocyte renewal from ovarian stem cells. Activated MDC are
                        also associated with follicular development and atresia, and corpus luteum
                        differentiation. Corpus luteum demise resembles rejection of a graft since
                        it is attended by a massive influx of MDC and T cells resulting in
                        parenchymal and vascular regression. Vascular pericytes play important
                        roles in immune physiology, and their activities (including secretion of
                        the Thy-1 differentiation protein) can be regulated by vascular autonomic
                        innervation. In tumors, MDC regulate proliferation of neoplastic cells and
                        angiogenesis. Tumor infiltrating T cells die among malignant cells.
                        Alterations of immune physiology can result in pathology, such as
                        autoimmune, metabolic, and degenerative diseases, but also in infertility
                        and intrauterine growth retardation, fetal morbidity and mortality. Animal
                        experiments indicate that modification of tissue differentiation
                        (retardation or acceleration) during immune adaptation can cause
                        malfunction (persistent immaturity or premature aging) of such tissue
                        during adulthood. Thus successful stem cell therapy will depend on immune
                        physiology in targeted tissues. From this point of view, regenerative
                        medicine is more likely to be successful in acute rather than chronic
                        tissue disorders.
