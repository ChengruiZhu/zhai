Skeletal myogenesis is coordinated by multiple signaling pathways that control cell adhesion/migration, survival and differentiation accompanied by muscle-specific gene expression. A cell surface protein Cdo is involved in cell contact-mediated promyogenic signals through activation of p38MAPK and AKT. Protein kinase C-related kinase 2 (PKN2/PRK2) is implicated in regulation of various biological processes, including cell migration, adhesion and death. It has been shown to interact with and inhibit AKT thereby inducing cell death. This led us to investigate the role of PKN2 in skeletal myogenesis and the crosstalk between PKN2 and Cdo. Like Cdo, PKN2 was upregulated in C2C12 myoblasts during differentiation and decreased in cells with Cdo depletion caused by shRNA or cultured on integrin-independent substratum. This decline of PKN2 levels resulted in diminished AKT activation during myoblast differentiation. Consistently, PKN2 overexpression-enhanced C2C12 myoblast differentiation, whereas PKN2-depletion impaired it, without affecting cell survival. PKN2 formed complexes with Cdo, APPL1 and AKT via its C-terminal region and this interaction appeared to be important for induction of AKT activity as well as myoblast differentiation. Furthermore, PKN2-enhanced MyoD-responsive reporter activities by mediating the recruitment of BAF60c and MyoD to the myogenin promoter. Taken together, PKN2 has a critical role in cell adhesion-mediated AKT activation during myoblast differentiation.
