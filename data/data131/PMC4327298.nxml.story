The objective of this research was to evaluate the influence of gender and bruxism on the maximum bite force. The concordance for the physical examination of bruxism between examiners was also evaluated. One hundred and eighteen individuals, from both genders, bruxists and non-bruxists, with an average age of 24 years, were selected for this purpose. For group establishment, every individual was submitted to a specific physical examination for bruxism (performed by three different examiners). Subjects were then divided into four groups according to gender and the presence of bruxism. The maximum bite force was measured using a gnathodynamometer at the first molar area, three times on each side, performed twice. The two measurements were made with a 10-day interval. The highest value was recorded. The mean maximum bite force was statistically higher for males (587.2 N) when compared to females (424.9 N) (p<0.05), regardless of the presence of bruxism. The presence of bruxism did not influence the bite force (mean maximum bite force value for bruxists: 490.1 N, and for non bruxists: 522.1 N) (p>0.05). The concordance between examiners for physical examination of bruxism was considered optimal.
