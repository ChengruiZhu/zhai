Identification of miRNA-disease associations is considered as a key way for the development of pathology, diagnose and therapy. Computational prediction models contribute to discovering the underlying disease-related miRNAs on a large scale. Based on the assumption that functionally related miRNAs tend to be involved in phenotypically similar disease and vice versa, the model of PBMDA was developed to prioritize the underlying miRNA-disease associations by adopting a special depth-first search algorithm in a heterogeneous graph, which was composed of known miRNA-disease association network, miRNA similarity network, and disease similarity network. Through leave-one-out cross validation and 5-fold cross validation, the promising results demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed model. We further implemented the case studies of three important human complex diseases, 88%, 88% and 90% of top-50 predicted miRNA-disease associations have been manually confirmed based on recent experimental reports. It is anticipated that PBMDA could prioritize the most potential miRNA-disease associations on a large scale for advancing the progress of biological experiment validation in the future, which could further contribute to the understanding of complex disease mechanisms.
