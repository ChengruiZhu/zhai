The clinical evidence indicated that cyclophosphamide (CPD), one of the chemotherapy drugs, caused severe deteriorations in bones of cancer patients. However, the exact mechanisms by which CPD exerts effects on bone remodeling is not yet fully elucidated. Therefore, this study was performed to investigate the role and potential mechanism of CPD in osteoblastogenesis and osteoclastogenesis. Here it was found that CPD treatment (100mg/kg/day) for 7 days led to osteoporosis phenotype in male mice. CPD inhibited osteoblastogenesis as shown by decreasing the number and differentiation of bone mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) and reducing the formation and activity of osteoblasts. Moreover, CPD suppressed the osteoclastogenesis mediated by receptor activator for nuclear factor-κ B ligand (RANKL) as shown by reducing the maturation and activity of osteoclasts. At the molecular level, CPD exerted inhibitory effect on the expression of components (Cyclin D1, β-catenin, Wnt 1, Wnt10b) of Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway in MSCs and osteoblasts-specific factors (alkaline phosphatase, Runx2, and osteocalcin). CPD also down-regulated the expression of the components (tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factor 6, nuclear factor of activated T-cells cytoplasm 1, c-Fos and NF-κB) of RANKL signaling pathway and the factors (matrix metalloproteinase 9, cathepsin K, tartrate-resistant acid phosphates and carbonic anhydrase II) for osteoclastic activity. Taken together, this study demonstrated that the short-term treatment of CPD induced osteoporosis in mice and the underlying mechanism might be attributed to its marked suppression on osteoblastogenesis and osteoclastogenesis, especially the effect of CPD on bone formation might play a dominant role in its detrimental effects on bone remodeling.
