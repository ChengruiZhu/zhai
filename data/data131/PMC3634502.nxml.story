-dependent deacetylases Sirt1 and Sirt2 mediate cellular stress responses and are highly expressed in vascular endothelial cells. In contrast to the well-documented protective actions of Sirt1, the role of endothelial Sirt2 remains unknown. Using cDNA microarray and PCR validation, we examined global gene expression changes in response to Sirt2 knock down in primary human umbilical vein endothelial cells under oxidative stress. We found that Sirt2 knock down changed expression of 340 genes, which are mainly involved in cellular processes including actin binding, cellular amino acid metabolic process, transmembrane receptor protein serine/threonine kinase signaling, ferrous iron transport, protein transport and localization, cell morphogenesis, and functions associated with endosome membrane and the trans-Golgi network. These genes and associated functions were largely non-overlapping with those altered by Sirt1 knock down. Moreover, we showed that pharmacological inhibition of Sirt2 attenuated oxidant-induced cell toxicity in endothelial cells. These suggest that Sirt2 is functionally important in endothelial cells under oxidative stress, and may have a primarily distinct role as compared to Sirt1. Our results may provide a basis for future studies aiming to dissect the specific signaling pathway(s) that mediates specific Sirt2 functions in endothelial cells.
