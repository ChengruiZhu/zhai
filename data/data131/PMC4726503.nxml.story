The skin is frequently exposed to various challenges that cause oxidative stress, such as UV irradiation, exposure to toxic chemicals or mechanical injury. Therefore, keratinocytes -the major cell type of the outermost layer of our skinâ€”need sophisticated antioxidant defense systems. However, the relevance of individual defense systems and their interaction in the cell are largely unknown. Here we studied the role of glutathione, the most abundant cellular antioxidant, in keratinocytes. We show that in the absence of the enzyme that catalyzes the rate-limiting step in glutathione biosynthesis, keratinocytes initiate a complex cell death program, resulting in reduced survival of these cells in culture and in mouse skin. Despite this, the epidermal structure was only mildly affected and the mutant mice were even able to heal full-thickness excisional skin wounds. We found that this is ensured by compensatory functions of another antioxidant defense system, allowing survival of keratinocytes in the absence of glutathione. These results therefore demonstrate a remarkable antioxidant defense capacity of keratinocytes that guarantees maintenance of the essential barrier of the skin and efficient wound repair.
