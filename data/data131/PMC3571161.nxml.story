]. The scoping exercise identified that there was a need for tele-rehabilitation to address the difficulties this population face in travelling to appointments, and that it was feasible as most people already had access to computers with broadband internet connection. The pilot study showed that PC-based video-conferencing in a real-life situation, linking peopleâ€™s homes to a clinical base, is technically feasible and resulted in positive feedback from clients and the therapist. Technology functioned effectively, facilitating satisfactory interactions between clients and therapist. Technical problems were judged by clients and therapist not to interfere with the interaction. An implementation guide including tips for best practice and troubleshooting has been produced. This project to date has had an impact on the service and the patients. The interventions delivered by video-conferencing have resulted in high satisfaction levels for patients and have produced similar clinical outcomes to in-person delivery. This mode of delivery is being used for both consultant review sessions and patient to therapist interactions. The use of video-conferencing is now embedded into the service and offered to patients when travel or level of disability could affect attendance due to difficulties with transport or level of symptoms.
