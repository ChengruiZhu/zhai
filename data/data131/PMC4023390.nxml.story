The dorsal tubercle of the radius, once called Lister’s tubercle, is used as a landmark in wrist arthroscopy, wrist
joint injections, and similar surgical and clinical procedures. However, there is no useful information in the reference
anatomy books and literature. The aim of this study was to identify the anatomical localization of Lister’s tubercle on the
dorsum of radius in relation to the radial styloid process and the ulnar notch of radius and to demonstrate the clinical and
surgical importance of these relationships. We studied 20 dried cadaver radius specimens. The distances from Lister’s
tubercle to the radial styloid process and to the ulnar notch were measured by using a digital micrometer caliber and the
ratio of the two measures was calculated. The dorsal tubercle of the radius is variable in position and can be either closer
to the radial styloid process or to the ulnar notch. The present study showed that in 11 of the radii the dorsal tubercle of
the radius was nearer to the radial styloid process than the ulnar notch, while in 9 subjects it was nearer to the ulnar notch.
This anatomical variation may be relevant for wrist injections, wrist artroscopy or wrist surgery.
