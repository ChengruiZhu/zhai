Patients ages ranged between 27 and 67 years, mean age 43years, SD 10.34 years, N = 20 Initial breast tumour sizes ranged between 0.5 and 9 cm, mean 4.05 cm, SD 2.38. There were three T4, four T3 tumours, seven T2 and six T1 tumours. Clinical axillary lymphadenopathy with pathological involvement was present in 11 cases. Histological diagnosis showed 13 cases of invasive ductal carcinoma (65.0%), 2 cases of ductal carcinoma insitu (10.0%), 1 papillary carcinoma (5.0%), 3 cases of invasive lobular carcinoma (15.0%) and non-specific type 1 (5.0%). Immunohistochemistry assessment available in 15 cases was positive for estrogen and progesterone receptors in 10 cases. Two cases (10.0%) exhibited 20% positivity for human epidermal growth factor receptor. Pathological complete regression (PCR) defined as no invasive or insitu tumour residuals in the excised tumour bed, was achieved in the 18 cases assessed. (100%) This was consistent with clinical complete response obtained. It was not determined in 2 cases though clinical complete response was obtained. PCR was determined in ten cases (50.0%) at the first reexcision, second reexcision in 4 cases (20.0%) and third reexcision in 4 cases (20.0%). Mean no of re-excisions 1.67 cm, SD 0.84. Six sequential anthracycline/taxane cycles were administered in 17 cases while three cases received anthracycline based chemotherapy only. Median duration of followup from diagnosis was 48 months ranging between 8 months and 144 months. There were two demises at 48 months and 36 months follow up.
