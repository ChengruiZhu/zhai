For the communication between two nerve cells, a synaptic vesicle containing neurotransmitters has to fuse with the neuronal membrane at a specific fusion site, releasing its signaling molecules. The vesicle fusion is mediated by a specific family of proteins (SNAREs) that are located on the vesicle as well as on the neuronal membrane. As many other membrane proteins, SNARE proteins are not uniformly distributed over the membrane but rather exist in complexes or clusters. Syntaxin, one of the SNARE proteins, is known to form such clusters through attractive protein-protein interactions. With the help of light microscopy techniques we show that the actual size and abundance of these clusters depends on its proximity to the fusion site on the membrane. We developed a computational model of Syntaxin cluster formation that can explain the observed differences in clustering and allow us to speculate on their potential role in the process of docking and fusion of synaptic vesicles. The formation of clusters through weak protein-protein interactions allow for a highly dynamic behavior of proteins, being able to easily switch between a state with stable and almost immobile clusters and a more dynamic situation with clusters exchanging particles at high rates.
