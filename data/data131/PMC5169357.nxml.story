Proposals for new infrastructure in developing countries are typically muted on its environmental impacts, while environmentalists typically say little about its potential benefits for people. This study explores a more conciliatory approach by trying to identify where beneficial infrastructure might be expanded at least environmental cost. Focusing on the Greater Mekong Subregion of Southeast Asia, we intersected agricultural, social, and environmental layers to map variation in the potential for new roads to enhance food production and in their likely impacts on biodiversity and ecosystem services. In several areas (such as central Thailand and the Ayeyarwady Delta) well-planned road expansion has the potential—if linked to strong habitat protection elsewhere—to help boost agricultural production at limited environmental cost. In others (including much of Laos, Central Vietnam, and eastern Cambodia), new roads would risk marked environmental harm, often for little agricultural gain. By mapping specific proposals onto our data layers, we were also able to identify planned roads that might deliver low-impact improvements in food production and others that risk disproportionate environmental costs. We hope these analyses can help guide future road planning in this exceptionally diverse, rapidly developing area.
