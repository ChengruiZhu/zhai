Eighty percent of participants reported high family functioning and 60 % and 50 % of participants reported high-quality mother and father relationship, respectively. Among both males and females, high family functioning was associated with lower odds of disordered eating (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] females = 0.53; 95 % Confidence Interval [CI] = 0.45–0.63; AOR males = 0.48; CI = 0.39–0.60), insufficient physical activity, i.e., less than 1 h/day, (AOR females = 0.74; CI = 0.61–0.89; AOR males = 0.73; CI = 0.58–0.92), and insufficient sleep, i.e., less than 7 h/day, (AOR females = 0.56; CI = 0.45–0.68; AOR males = 0.65; CI 0.5–0.85). High family functioning was also associated with lower odds of being overweight/obese (AOR = 0.73; CI = 0.60–0.88) and eating fast food one or more times/week (AOR = 0.74; CI = 0.61–0.89) among females only. Among females, high-quality mother and father relationship were both associated with lower odds of being overweight/obese and disordered eating, eating fast food, and insufficient sleep and the magnitude of associations were similar for mother and father relationship quality (AOR range 0.61–0.84). Among males, high-quality mother and father relationship were both associated with lower odds of disordered eating, insufficient physical activity and insufficient sleep, but only father relationship quality was associated with lower odds of overweight/obesity.
