Coronary artery aneurysms are rare in the general population. There are no randomized control trials to guide the therapy at this moment. We present a case of a 52-year-old male who was recovering from addiction and was sober for past five years. He came to the hospital with typical chest pain. There were ST segment depressions in leads III and AVF. The second troponin was found to be elevated. The impression was non-ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction. He was started on subcutaneous enoxaparin and underwent left heart catheterization which revealed dilated ectatic coronary arteries with aneurysmal dilatation. In addition, there was sluggish blood flow and several blood clots mainly in the left circumflex artery. No intervention was performed and the patient was started on heparin drip which was transitioned to warfarin on discharge. The echocardiogram revealed an ejection fraction of 35% with anterior and inferoseptal wall dyskinesia. Echocardiogram at one-year follow-up showed improved ejection fraction of 50% with similar wall dyskinesia. Coronary artery aneurysms are treated with medical management with or without invasive approach. Invasive management is conducted in people with stenosis and can be achieved by coronary artery bypass graft or covered stents.
