We present a case of retinitis pigmentosa (RP) related cystoid macular edema (CME) refractory to oral acetazolamide and topical ketorolac that was treated with intravitreal and subtenon depot triamcinolone. A 32-year-old male with RP presented with complaints of bilateral decrease in visual acuity. His best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) was 20/50 in the right eye and 20/100 in the left eye. After being informed of the available treatment options, the patient received bilateral intravitreal injection triamcinolone. The patient's BCVA improved to 20/40 in the right eye and 20/50 in the left eye and the CME was resorbed. However, 5 months after the injection in the left eye and two months in the right eye, visual acuity decreased due to recurrence of CME. We performed a second intravitreal injection in the left eye with improvement of visual and anatomic results, but we observed a recurrence of CME. Afterwards, we treated the patient with subtenon depot triamcinolone in both eyes, with the result that there was no recurrence after 4 months in OD or after 3 months in OS. We conclude that intravitreal and subtenon depot triamcinolone appear to provide at least temporary benefit in refractory CME as regards the improvement of visual acuity.
