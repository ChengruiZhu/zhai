Pollinating bees, along with bats, hummingbirds, rodents and primates, typically develop circuits (traplines) to visit multiple foraging sites in an efficient stable sequence. The question of how animals encode and process spatial information to develop these impressive foraging patterns remains poorly understood. Previously we showed that an iterative improvement heuristic model of bumblebee traplining can replicate the establishment of stable routes by bees between flowers distributed over several hectares. Here we tested the model against a variety of datasets with different configurations of flowers and found it to give good agreements with all these observations. We have thus shown how these complex dynamic routing problems can be solved by small-brained bees using simple learning heuristics and without acquiring a ‘map-like’ memory. The proposed heuristic shows how bees develop optimal routes simply by following multi-segment journeys composed of learnt flight routines (local vectors), each pointing towards target locations (flowers) and coupled to a visual context (landmarks or panoramas). Such a decentralized representation of space relying on learnt sensorimotor routines is akin to ‘route-based’ navigation as described in desert ants, where spatial information is thought to be processed by separate, potentially modular, guidance systems.
