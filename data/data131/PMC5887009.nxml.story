Asymmetric flow field-flow fractionation coupled with use of ultravioletâ€“visible, multiangle light scattering (MALLS), and dynamic light scattering (DLS) detectors was used for separation and characterization of biologically synthesized silver composites in two liquid compositions. Moreover, to supplement the DLS/MALLS information, various complementary techniques such as transmission electron spectroscopy, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, and matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) were used. The hydrodynamic diameter and the radius of gyration of silver composites were slightly larger than the sizes obtained by transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Moreover, the TEM results revealed the presence of silver clusters and even several morphologies, including multitwinned. Additionally, MALDI-TOF MS examination showed that the particles have an uncommon cluster structure. It can be described as being composed of two or more silver clusters. The organic surface of the nanoparticles can modify their dispersion. We demonstrated that the variation of the silver surface coating directly influenced the migration rate of biologically synthesized silver composites. Moreover, this study proves that the fractionation mechanism of silver biocolloids relies not only on the particle size but also on the type and mass of the surface coatings. Because silver nanoparticles typically have size-dependent cytotoxicity, this behavior is particularly relevant for biomedical applications.
