 The pancreatic exocrine cell of the guinea pig has a voluminous endoplasmic reticulum distinguished by extensive association with small, dense particles, and by its orderly disposition in the basal region of the cell. In addition to the small, (∼15 mµ), dense particles attached to the limiting membrane of the endoplasmic reticulum, numerous particles of similar appearance are found freely scattered in the cytoplasmic matrix. The various cell structures of pancreatic exocrine cells can be satisfactorily identified in pancreatic homogenates. The microsome fraction consists primarily of spherical vesicles (80 to 300 mµ), limited by a thin membrane (7 mµ) which bears small (∼15 mµ) dense particles attached on its outer surface. The content of the microsomal vesicles is usually of high density. Pancreatic microsomes derive by extensive fragmentation mainly from the rough surfaced parts of the endoplasmic reticula of exocrine cells. A few damaged mitochondria and certain dense granules (∼150 mµ) originating probably from islet cells, contaminate the microsome fraction. Pancreatic microsomes contain RNA, protein, and a relatively small amount of phospholipide and hemochromogen. They do not have DPNH-cytochrome
