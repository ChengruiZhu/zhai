This study investigates the differences in hip biomechanics for subjects following a total hip arthroplasty (THA), through the lateral approach (LA) and posterior approach (PA), to those with no pathology (NP). The principal component analysis was performed on two kinematic and two kinetic waveforms (subject-based characteristics) from level gait to identify salient portions of the waveforms for comparison between the subject cohorts. These were classified to identify the differences between post-THA and non-pathological cohorts. The primary technique exposited in the THA analysis is classification and ranking belief simplex (CaRBS). Within the analysis, from the configuration of a CaRBS model, there is discussion on the model fit and contribution of the subject-based characteristics. Where appropriate, comparisons to the CaRBS model are made with the results from a logistic regression (LR) analysis. In terms of model fit, using CaRBS, 24 out of 27 LA/PA subjects (88.89%) and 13 out of 16 NP subjects (81.25%) were correctly classified as exhibiting either post-THA or NP hip functional characteristics during level gait, combining to 86.05% classification accuracy, compared with 81.40% classification accuracy when using LR.
