Hemangioma is one of the most common types of infantile vascular benign tumor. The aim of the present study was to investigate the role of B-cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2) and tumor protein p53 (p53) in the proliferation and apoptosis of hemangioma cells. A total of 38 paraffin-embedded hemangioma specimens (16 males and 22 females) and another 5 paraffin-embedded healthy surrounding tissue samples, collected between January 2007 and December 2010, were obtained from the Department of Pathology at Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University (Wuhan, China). Immunohistochemistry, hematoxylin and eosin staining, and quantum dot double staining were used to detect the expression of proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA), Bcl-2 and p53 in hemangioma and healthy surrounding skin tissue samples. All hemangioma specimens were classified into proliferative or the involuting stage hemangioma according to Mulliken's criteria and their expression of PCNA. The results of the quantum dot double staining were analyzed using a multi-spectral imaging system. One-way analysis of the variance and the Student-Newman-Keuls q test were performed to statistically analyze the data. There were 24 cases of proliferative stage and 14 cases of involuting stage hemangioma among the specimens. Immunohistochemical analysis results indicated a high expression of Bcl-2 and p53 in proliferative stage hemangioma tissue samples, and low expression in involuting stage hemangioma and healthy tissue samples. Statistical analysis of the results from quantum dot double staining demonstrated that the expression of Bcl-2 and p53 in proliferative hemangioma was significantly increased compared with that in involuting stage specimens (P<0.05) and healthy tissue samples (P<0.05). No significant difference in Bcl-2 and p53 expression was identified between the involuting hemangioma and healthy surrounding tissue samples. The higher expression of Bcl-2 and p53 in proliferative hemangioma suggests that Bcl-2 may cause an imbalance between endothelial cell proliferation and apoptosis through the inhibition of endothelial cell apoptosis. Furthermore, p53 may promote the proliferation of endothelial cells in proliferative hemangioma.
