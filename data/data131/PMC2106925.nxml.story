 Interferometric and photometric measurements have been made on HeLa cells, a strain of cells originally derived from a human carcinoma. From a study of the relations between successive physical measurements on individual cells, it was confirmed that, whereas the net syntheses of nuclear RNA and nuclear protein are closely associated during interphase, they are dissociated from DNA replication to a significant extent. These results on nuclear metabolism agree with others previously reported in cell strains derived from tumors; they contrast with results from freshly prepared normal cells, where the net syntheses of DNA, nuclear RNA, and protein are closely associated during interphase. Cytoplasmic measurements on HeLa cells showed that much of the net synthesis of cytoplasmic RNA is associated with DNA replication as in normal cells, and they failed to detect transfer from the nucleus of a stable RNA component synthesized independently from DNA replication. In auxiliary experiments, an inhibition of the onset of DNA synthesis was produced by a dose of X-rays; under these conditions it was shown that the major part of the accumulation of nuclear protein was independent of DNA replication and that the accumulation of nuclear RNA was equivalent to or slightly less than that of nuclear protein. About half the accumulation of cytoplasmic RNA was inhibited when DNA synthesis was blocked.
