Uganda has regularly reported cholera since its first appearance in 1971. Although the Government of Uganda implements cholera prevention and control interventions such as provision of safe water, promotion of sanitation and hygiene, health education and healthcare, the disease continues to threaten many districts in the country. The population with access to improved water supply in the urban and rural areas were 71% and 67% respectively, and with access to improved sanitation was 86% in urban areas and 79% in rural areas. Identifying the districts with increased risk is an important step in defining areas where additional preventive interventions are needed. We used district level confirmed cholera outbreak data for a six year period (2011–2016), and identified cholera “hotspot” districts. Rates of cholera in these districts, with a population of about 7 million, are 2 to 22 times higher than elsewhere in the country. These “hotspots” located along the international borders with Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) and Kenya and the internationally shared lakes and river Nile. Targeted cholera prevention and control interventions to the hotspots in Uganda could lead to reduction in cholera cases and deaths. The hotspots identified herein provide an affordable way of implementation of the comprehensive cholera prevention and control mechanism as recommended by WHO. Since the hotspots are along the international borders, collaboration with the neighboring countries is the key to eliminate cholera in Uganda and the region as a whole.
