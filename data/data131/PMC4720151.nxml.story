Generation of antibody-producing cells through terminal B cell differentiation represents a good model to study the formation of multiple effector cells from a progenitor cell type. This process is controlled by the action of several molecules that maintain cell type specific programs in response to cytokines, antigen recognition and the direct contact with T helper cells, forming a complex regulatory network. While there is a large body of experimental data regarding some of the key molecules involved in this process and there have been several efforts to reconstruct the underlying regulatory network, a general consensus about the structure and dynamical behavior of this network is lacking. Moreover, it is not well understood how this network controls the establishment of specific B cell expression patterns and how it responds to specific external signals. We present a model of the regulatory network controlling terminal B cell differentiation and analyze its dynamical behavior under normal and mutant conditions. The model recovers the patterns of differentiation of B cells and describes a large set of gain- and loss-of-function mutants. This model provides an unified framework to generate qualitative descriptions to interpret the role of intra- and extracellular regulators of B cell differentiation.
