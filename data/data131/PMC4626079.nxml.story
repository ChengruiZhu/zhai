Many different animals (from insects to primates) try to escape from collision threats, because it is very possible that the approaching object is a predator. The corresponding neurons in the various nervous systems must therefore detect such threats and signal when it is time to escape. Surprisingly, the neurons of different animals which selectively respond to approaching objects have very similar properties. It is therefore worthwhile to understand their underlying computational principles. A common characteristic of such neurons is that they receive (or integrate) information from the whole visual field. The integration process is carried out by the dendritic tree of the neuron. Here we present a computational model in which we assume that each of the input signals is contaminated by noise, as well as having a response threshold (which has to be crossed in order to evoke a response). Then, dendritic integration approximates a mathematical function (a power law) which is essential in our model for explaining the response characteristics of collision-sensitive neurons. Thus, noise is used in a constructive way for computing collision-sensitive responses. Power laws are furthermore found in many different contexts, and may consequently hint at the presence of noise and thresholds.
