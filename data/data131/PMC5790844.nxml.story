Consecutive patients referred with suspected heart failure were prospectively enrolled. After excluding patients with implantable cardiac devices and atrial fibrillation, 1420 patients with heart failure and reduced ejection fraction (HeFREF) [age: median 71 (interquartile range IQR 63–78) years; men: 71%; NT-ProBNP: 1319 (583–3378) ng/L], 1094 with heart failure and normal ejection fraction (HeFNEF) [age: 76 (70–82) years; men: 47%; NT-ProBNP: 547 (321–1171) ng/L], and 1150 without heart failure [age: 68 (60–75) years; men: 51%; NT-ProBNP: 86 (46–140) ng/L] were included. The prevalence of first-degree heart block [heart rate corrected PR interval (PRc) > 200 ms] was higher in patients with heart failure (21% HeFREF, 20% HeFNEF, 9% without heart failure). In patients with HeFREF or HeFNEF, longer baseline PRc was associated with greater age, male sex, and longer QRS duration, and, in those with HeFREF, treatment with amiodarone or digoxin. Patients with heart failure in the longest PRc quartile had worse survival compared to shorter PRc quartiles, but PRc was not independently associated with survival in multivariable analysis. For patients without heart failure, shorter baseline PRc was independently associated with worse survival.
