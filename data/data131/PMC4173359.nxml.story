One of the most exiting recent technological advances in the field of anesthesia to track the region of interest is the introduction of anatomical evaluation by ultrasound imaging. Widespread use of this modality depends on its proven clinical efficacy, cost effectiveness, and practicality as it allows anesthesiologist to evaluate complex and varied anatomy prior to needle insertion. Sound used in medicine is not significantly transmitted by air or bone but through fluids which make up the larger part of soft tissues in the body. Ultrasound has been shown to offer excellent guidance for difficult venous access, epidural space identification in cases of difficult anatomy, delineating nerve plexuses for chronic nerve blocks, for regional anesthesia, and in transesophageal echocardiography for cardiac imaging with blood flows or in an otherwise high-risk patient where interventional procedure is required. It has special application to assess the narrowest diameter of the subglottic upper airway. A systemic literature search was performed in PubMed and the Cochrane library. The search strategy was set up using either single text word or combinations. We also included the studies where in these techniques were compared with conventional methods . Despite the initial excitement of this technique, ultrasound visualization is still indirect and images are subject to individual interpretation. It is gradually becoming routine in daily practice at our institution due to its reliability and safety. Though ultrasound is much safer, exposure in terms of intensity and time should be limited as far as possible, as high-energy ultrasound can cause heating and damage to tissues. In this review, we discuss established and future areas of ultrasound imaging and emphasize the use of B-mode ultrasound to improve the efficacy of interventional techniques. We have also illustrated potential uses with reference to cross-sectional B-mode images which visually represent a slice of tissues and are the easiest images for interpretation by clinicians.
