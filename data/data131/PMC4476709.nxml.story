Emotions are an important aspect of human experience and behavior; yet, we do not have a clear understanding of how they are processed in the brain. We have identified a neural signature of negative emotion—a neural activation pattern distributed across the brain that accurately predicts how negative a person will feel after viewing an aversive image. This pattern encompasses multiple brain subnetworks in the cortex and subcortex. This neural activation pattern dramatically outperforms other brain indicators of emotion based on activation in individual regions (e.g., amygdala, insula, and anterior cingulate) as well as networks of regions (e.g., limbic and “salience” networks). In addition, no single subnetwork is necessary or sufficient for accurately determining the intensity and type of affective response. Finally, this pattern appears to be specific to picture-induced negative affect, as it did not respond to at least one other aversive experience: painful heat. Together, these results provide a neurophysiological marker for feelings induced by a widely used probe of negative affect and suggest that brain imaging has the potential to accurately uncover how someone is feeling based purely on measures of brain activity.
