Due to their lack of distinct morphological features, bacteria and archaea were extremely difficult to classify until technology was developed to obtain their DNA sequences; these sequences could then be compared to estimate evolutionary relationships. Now, due to technological advances, there is a flood of available sequences from a wide variety of organisms. These advances have spurred the development of algorithms which can estimate evolutionary relationships using whole genomes, in contrast to the more traditional methods which used single genes earlier and now typically use groups of conserved genes. However, there are many challenges when attempting to infer evolutionary relationships, in particular horizontal gene transfer, where DNA is transferred from one organism to another, resulting in an organismâ€™s genome containing DNA that does not reflect its evolution by descent. We developed a new whole-genome method for estimating evolutionary distances which identifies and corrects for horizontal transfer. We found that for SlopeTree and all other whole-genome methods we applied, horizontal transfer causes some evolutionary distances to be grossly underestimated, and that our correction corrects for this.
