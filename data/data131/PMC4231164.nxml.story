Even in developed countries, infectious disease has significant impact; for example, flu seasons in the United States take between 3,000 and 49,000 lives. Disease surveillance, traditionally based on patient visits to health providers and laboratory tests, can reduce these impacts. Motivated by cost and timeliness, surveillance methods based on internet data have recently emerged, but are not yet reliable for several reasons, including weak scientific peer review, breadth of diseases and countries covered, and underdeveloped forecasting capabilities. We argue that these challenges can be overcome by using a freely available data source: aggregated access logs from the online encyclopedia Wikipedia. Using simple statistical techniques, our proof-of-concept experiments suggest that these data are effective for predicting the present, as well as forecasting up to the 28-day limit of our tests. Our results also suggest that these models can be used even in places with no official data upon which to build models. In short, this paper establishes the utility of Wikipedia as a broadly effective data source for disease information, and we outline a path to a reliable, scientifically sound, operational, and global disease surveillance system that overcomes key gaps in existing traditional and internet-based techniques.
