Apoptosis and necrosis are the two major forms of cell death mechanisms. Both forms of cell death are involved in several physiological and pathological conditions and also in the elimination of cancer cells following successful chemotherapy. Large number of cellular and biochemical assays have evolved to determine apoptosis or necrosis for qualitative and quantitative purposes. A closer analysis of the assays and their performance reveal the difficulty in using any of these methods as a confirmatory approach, owing to the secondary induction of necrosis in apoptotic cells. This highlights the essential requirement of an approach with a real-time analysis capability for discriminating the two forms of cell death. This paper describes a sensitive live cell-based method for distinguishing apoptosis and necrosis at single-cell level. The method uses cancer cells stably expressing genetically encoded FRET-based active caspase detection probe and DsRed fluorescent protein targeted to mitochondria. Caspase activation is visualized by loss of FRET upon cleavage of the FRET probe, while retention of mitochondrial fluorescence and loss of FRET probe before its cleavage confirms necrosis. The absence of cleavage as well as the retention of mitochondrial fluorescence indicates live cells. The method described here forms an extremely sensitive tool to visualize and quantify apoptosis and necrosis, which is adaptable for diverse microscopic, flow cytometric techniques and high-throughput imaging platforms with potential application in diverse areas of cell biology and oncology drug screening.
