The architecture of the cell nucleus and the spatial organization of the genome are important in determining nuclear functions. Single-cell imaging techniques and chromosome conformation capture (3C) based methods have provided a wealth of information on the spatial organization of chromosomes. Here we describe a multi-chromosome ensemble model of chromatin chains for understanding the folding principles of budding yeast genome. By overcoming severe challenges in sampling self-avoiding chromatin chains in nuclear confinement, we succeed in generating a large number of model genomes of budding yeast. Our model predicts chromatin interactions that have good correlation with experimental measurements. Our results showed that the spatial confinement of cell nucleus and excluded-volume effect are key determinants of the folding behavior of yeast chromosomes, and largely account for the observed intra-chromosomal interactions. Furthermore, we determined the specific roles of individual nuclear landmarks and biochemical factors, and our analysis showed that centromere tethering largely determines inter-chromosomal interactions. In addition, we were able to infer biological properties from the organization of modeled genomes. We found that the spatial locations of important elements such as fragile sites and tRNA genes are largely determined by the tethering of centromeres to the Spindle Pole Body. We further showed that many of these spatial locations can be predicted by using the genomic distances to the centromeres. Overall, our results revealed important insight into the organizational principles of the budding yeast genome and predicted a number of important biological findings that are fully experimentally testable.
