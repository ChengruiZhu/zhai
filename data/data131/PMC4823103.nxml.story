Long-term outcome of high-grade serous epithelial ovarian carcinoma (HGSOC) remains poor as a result of recurrence and the emergence of drug resistance. Almost all the patients were given the same platinum-based chemotherapy after debulking surgery even though some of them are naturally resistant to the first-line chemotherapy. No method could verify this part of patients right after the surgery currently. In this study, we used 156 paraffin-embedded high-grade HGSOC specimens for immunohistochemical analysis with 37 immunology markers, and association between the expression levels of these markers and the chemoresponse were evaluated. A support vector machine (SVM)-based HGSOC prognostic classifier was then established, and was validated by a 95-patient independent cohort. The classifier was strongly predictive of chemotherapy resistance, and divided patients into low- and high-risk groups with significant differences progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS). This classifier may provide a potential way to predict the chemotherapy resistance of HGSOC right after the surgery, and then allow clinicians to make optimal clinical decision for those potentially chemoresistant patients. The potential clinical application of this classifier will benefit those patients with primary drug resistance.
