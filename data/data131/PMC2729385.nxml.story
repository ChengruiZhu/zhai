The diversity of human cancers reflects the variety of genetic changes that cause tumors to emerge and progress. Even for mice engineered with a specific cancer-causing mutation, the resulting tumors are often divergent, reflecting different additional mutations. We wanted to investigate how activities that work together can collaborate in tumorigenesis. Specifically, we are interested in Myc and the E2F family of proteins, intersecting activities that influence a cell's decision to replicate, rest, or die. We made use of an engineered mouse that develops pre-B and B cell lymphoma initiated by Myc and tested whether the loss of particular E2F family members influences these lymphomas. We found that tumor emergence was accelerated by E2F2 loss and delayed by E2F4 loss. We attributed these results to the finding that the mice lacking E2F2 have a greater proportion than usual of the most susceptible, early-stage B lineage cells and the mice lacking E2F4 have fewer of these cells. Distinct tumor types emerged with their relative proportions influenced by E2F2 and E2F4 status. We conclude that the variety of tumors probably reflect different stages of B lymphoid development that respond to Myc and that E2F proteins can influence the proportions of these different stages.
