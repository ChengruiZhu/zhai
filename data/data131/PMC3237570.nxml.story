Alpha4 is a regulatory subunit of the protein phosphatase family of enzymes and plays an essential role in regulating the catalytic subunit of PP2A (PP2Ac) within the rapamycin-sensitive signaling pathway. Alpha4 also interacts with MID1, a microtubule-associated ubiquitin E3 ligase that appears to regulate the function of PP2A. The C-terminal region of alpha4 plays a key role in the binding interaction of PP2Ac and MID1. Here we report on the solution structure of a 45-amino acid region derived from the C-terminus of alpha4 (alpha45) that binds tightly to MID1. In aqueous solution, alpha45 has properties of an intrinsically unstructured peptide although chemical shift index and dihedral angle estimation based on chemical shifts of backbone atoms indicate the presence of a transient Î±-helix. Alpha45 adopts a helix-turn-helix HEAT-like structure in 1% SDS micelles, which may mimic a negatively charged surface for which alpha45 could bind. Alpha45 binds tightly to the Bbox1 domain of MID1 in aqueous solution and adopts a structure consistent with the helix-turn-helix structure observed in 1% SDS. The structure of alpha45 reveals two distinct surfaces, one that can interact with a negatively charged surface, which is present on PP2A, and one that interacts with the Bbox1 domain of MID1.
