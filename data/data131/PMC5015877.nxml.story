Transplant-associated thrombotic microangiopathy (TA-TMA) is a multifactorial disorder caused by systemic vascular endothelial injury that can be triggered by several mechanisms during the transplant process. Thrombotic microangiopathy may affect multiple systems and occurs in ~30% of patients undergoing hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. A subgroup of patients with thrombotic microangiopathy develop TA-TMA, and the other may develop other thrombotic microangiopathic disorders such as thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura, a condition with similar finding but different pathophysiology involving ADAMTS-13. The mortality rates in patients who develop severe TA-TMA are in excess of 80%. Recent investigations show that complement system activation in patients with TA-TMA is a very poor prognostic sign and implicates complement dysregulation as a key pathway in the pathogenesis of TA-TMA and its disease phenotype. The original diagnostic criteria for TA-TMA included hematologic and renal injury markers, which are limited in their ability to detect only advanced disease, and therefore may result in delayed TA-TMA diagnosis in transplant patients. A recent set of diagnostic criteria added markers of complement activation, proteinuria, and hypertension, with predicted improved detection of early TA-TMA. Supportive care that includes elimination of potentially toxic agents such as calcineurin inhibitors and sirolimus, adequate antimicrobial treatment, and maintaining adequate renal functions using renal replacement therapy may be sufficient for treatment of mild-to-moderate TA-TMA. Plasma exchange, which is a potentially curative therapy in thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura, has no proven efficacy in TA-TMA. Blocking the complement system with eculizumab is currently the most effective treatment to circumvent the poor outcome in patients with severe TA-TMA.
