One of the main functions of the brain is to select sequences of actions that lead to rewarding outcomes (e.g., food). However, such rewards are often not readily available; instead physical effort may be required to obtain them, or their arrival may be delayed. The ability to integrate the costs and benefits of potential courses of action is severely impaired in several common disorders, such as depression and schizophrenia. Mathematical models can describe how individuals depreciate rewards based on the costs associated with them. For example, models of how a reward loses appeal with increasing temporal delays can provide individual impulsivity scores, and can serve as a predictor of financial mismanagement. To date, there is no established model to describe accurately how humans depreciate rewards when obtaining them requires physical effort. This is surprising given the prevalence of disorders related to a diminished willingness to exert effort. Here we derive a biologically plausible mathematical model that can describe how healthy humans make decisions tied to physical efforts. We show that effort and delay influence reward valuation in different ways, contrary to common assumptions. Our model will be important for characterizing decision-making deficits in clinical disorders characterized by behavioral inactivity.
