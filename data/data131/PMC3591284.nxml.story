Our manuscript deals with the Protein arginine methyltransferase 4 (PRMT4), which modifies arginine residues in histones and other chromatin-associated proteins and plays an important role in the regulation of gene expression. We addressed the question of how the transcriptional function of PRMT4 might contribute to cell lineage specification despite its ubiquitious expression pattern and how this could explain its involvement in tumorigenesis. As protein associations are likely to provide an answer to this question, we attempted to identify novel interaction partners of PRMT4 using a biochemical approach. By this means, we found that PRMT4 binds Mi2α and its close relative Mi2β. In the search for the biological role of this interaction, we found that PRMT4 and Mi2α/β interact with the transcription factor c-Myb and cooperatively coactivate c-Myb target gene expression in haematopoietic cell lines. Depletion of PRMT4 or Mi2α/β in human erythroleukemia cells resulted in deregulated cell proliferation and differentiation resembling the effects caused by c-Myb depletion. Our findings unravel an important and so far unknown connection between PRMT4 and the chromatin remodeller Mi2 in c-Myb signalling and gene activation and identify both coregulators as attractive targets for leukaemia research and therapy in the future.
