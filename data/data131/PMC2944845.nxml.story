We established an interphase organotypic tissue culture for adult rat retinas (>P35 of age) which was optimized from that used for adult rabbit retinas. We implemented three optimizations: a greater volume of Ames' medium (>26 mL) per retina, a higher speed (constant 55 rpm) of agitation by rotary shaker, and a greater concentration (10%) of horse serum in the medium. We also successfully applied this method to adult mouse retina (>P35 of age). The organotypic tissue culture allowed us to keep adult rodent retina morphologically and structurally intact for at least 4 days. However, mouse retinas showed less viability after 4-day culture. Electrophysiologically, ganglion cells in cultured rat retina were able to generate action potentials, but exhibited less reliable light responses. After transfection of EGFP plasmids by particle-mediated acute gene transfer, we observed EGFP-expressing retinal ganglion cells as early as 1 day of culture. We also introduced polarized-targeting fusion proteins such as PSD95-GFP and melanopsin-EYFP (hOPN4-EYFP) into rat retinal ganglion cells. These fusion proteins were successfully transferred into appropriate locations on individual retinal neurons.
