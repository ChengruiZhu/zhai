To achieve good metabolic control in diabetes and maintain it in the long term, a combination of changes in lifestyle and pharmacological treatment is necessary. The need for insulin depends upon the balance between insulin secretion and insulin resistance. Insulin is considered the most effective glucose-lowering therapy available and is required by people with type 1 diabetes mellitus to control their blood glucose levels; yet, many people with type 2 diabetes mellitus will also eventually require insulin therapy, due to the progressive nature of the disease. A variety of long-acting insulins is currently used for basal insulin therapy (such as insulin glargine, degludec, and detemir), each having sufficient pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic profiles to afford lower intrapatient variability and an extended duration of action. The new glargine-300 formulation was developed to have a flatter and more extended time-action profile than the original glargine-100, and these characteristics may translate into more stable and sustained glycemic control over a 24â€‰h dosing interval. The objective of this comprehensive review was to summarize the available evidence on the clinical efficacy and safety of glargine-300 versus glargine-100 from the EDITION clinical trial program, in patients with type 1 and type 2 diabetes mellitus.
