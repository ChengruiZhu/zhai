BC (BC), as the most common malignancy in women worldwide, is associated with high morbidity and mortality. However, chemoresistance and toxicity are the main causes that limit the success of treatment in aggressive BC cases. Thus, there is a vital need to identify and develop novel therapeutic agents. Frankincense, pine needle and geranium essential oils have been reported to play critical biological activities in cancer. However, to the best of our knowledge whether frankincense, pine needle and geranium essential oils have any effect on the progression of BC in MCF-7 cells remains unclear. In the present study, we assessed the possible effects of frankincense, pine needle and geranium essential oils on cell viability, proliferation, migration and invasion as well as the possible mechanisms. MCF-7 cells were treated with oils, and associations with BC were investigated. In the present study, we clearly revealed that frankincense, pine needle and geranium essential oils suppressed cell viability, proliferation, migration and invasion in human BC MCF-7 cells. Further data demonstrated that frankincense, pine needle and geranium essential oils induced apoptosis, but did not affect cell cycle progression. Consistent with the
