Among 3149 eligible outpatients, 590 (18.7%) had IMCI non–severe pneumonia classification in re–examination. 228 (38.7%) classified cases received first–line antibiotics and 159 (26.9%) received no antibiotics. 18.6% with cough or difficult breathing had 60–second respiratory rates counted during consultations, and conducting this assessment was significantly associated with IMCI training ever received (odds ratio (OR) = 2.37, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.29–4.31) and negative rapid diagnostic test results (OR = 3.21, 95% CI: 1.45–7.13). Older children had lower odds of assessments than infants (OR = 48–59 months: 0.35, 95% CI: 0.16–0.75). Children presenting with any of the following complaints also had reduced odds of assessment: fever, diarrhea, skin problem or any danger sign. First–line antibiotic treatment for classified cases was significantly associated with high temperatures (OR = 3.26, 95% CI: 1.24–8.55) while older children had reduced odds of first–line treatment compared to infants (OR = 48–59 months: 0.29, 95% CI: 0.10–0.83). RDT–confirmed malaria was a significant predictor of no antibiotic receipt for IMCI non–severe pneumonia (OR = 10.65, 95% CI: 2.39–47.36).
