Many models of learning and decision-making assume that experienced rewards are stored without error. We examined this assumption experimentally: participants first learned an association between different options and rewards in a simple two-alternative choice task. We then asked them to report what reward they expected to receive for each of the options they had experienced. We checked that the reports we collected matched performance on the choice task, meaning that the values participants reported were the same as those they used to decide between options. The results showed that participants were both less precise (greater variability) and less accurate (greater bias) in their reports of middling reward values compared to either high- or low-valued options. Reports of high and low values were similar in quality even though participants had experienced the rewards associated with high-value options considerably more often. Whether an optionâ€™s value was stored well or poorly was not fixed, but instead depended on how the value compared to other options the participant had experienced. These results should lead to better models of how decisions are made based on experiences of reward.
