 The effect of electrotonus on the slow potential of the olfactory epithelium of the frog was studied. The "on"-slow potential induced by a general odor like amyl acetate increased its magnitude in accordance with increase of anodal current, while it decreased its magnitude with increase of cathodal current. Similar relations were also found in the case of the vapors of organic solvents like ethyl ether of low concentrations. Conversely, the on-slow potential induced by the vapors of organic solvents of high concentration decreased its magnitude in accordance with the increase of anodal current, while it increased its magnitude with the increase of cathodal current. The "off"-slow potential induced by the vapors of organic solvents of high concentration showed a potential change under the action of electrotonic currents which is similar to the change of the on-slow potential induced by general odors. It was concluded that there are two receptive processes in the olfactory cell. One is an ordinary excitatory process which produces an electronegative slow potential in response to general odors. The other is a process of a different kind which is activated only by the vapor of an organic solvent of high concentration and which shows an entirely opposite reaction from that generally found in excitable tissues when an electrotonic current is applied.
