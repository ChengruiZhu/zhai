The human genome contains many “at-risk” sequences that are prone to mutations, including diverse repeated sequences, segmental duplications and regions of copy number variations. Such repetitive sequence elements can cause genome rearrangements through non-allelic homologous recombination (NAHR) and many human diseases are caused by chromosomal rearrangements mediated by NAHR. Here we discovered that Mms21 dependent sumoylation has a major role in suppressing duplication-mediated GCRs. In addition, we showed that mutations of additional genes in sumoylation pathway cause the highest GCR defect known to date, demonstrating a critical role of sumoylation pathway in preventing duplication-mediated GCRs. We further developed a new quantitative proteomics technology to measure sumoylation levels of individual sumoylated proteins on a proteome-wide scale and applied this approach to uncover distinct and overlapping activities of SUMO ligases for substrate sumoylation. We further established the roles of Esc2 and Slx5 in regulating the SUMO proteome. Taken together these findings suggest a model in which a fine balance of Mms21 activity towards its substrates is critical for the suppression of chromosomal rearrangements. Our findings thus have important implications for cancer genetics as well as new insights into the regulation and substrate specificity of protein sumoylation enzymes.
