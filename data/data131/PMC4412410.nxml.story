Understanding movement control is challenging because the brains of nearly all animals send motor command signals to many muscles, and these signals produce complex movements. In studying animal movement, one cannot always record all the motor commands an animal uses or know all the ways in which movement varies in response. A combined approach is necessary to find the relevant patterns: the changes in movement that correspond to changes in the recorded motor commands. Techniques exist to identify simple patterns in either the motor commands or the movements, but in this paper we develop an approach that identifies patterns in both simultaneously. We use this technique to understand how agile flying insects control aerial turns. The two main downstroke muscles of moths are thought to produce turns by creating a power difference between the left and right wings. The moth’s brain may only need to specify the difference in activation between the two muscles. We discover that moth’s brain actually has independent control over each muscle, and this separate control increases the moth’s ability to adjust turning within a single wingstroke. Our computational approach reveals sophisticated patterns of movement processing even in the small nervous systems of insects.
