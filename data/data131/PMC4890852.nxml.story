Pathological protein aggregates are found in many neurodegenerative diseases, and it has been hypothesized that these protein aggregates are toxic and cause neuronal death. Little is known about how neurons protect against pathological protein aggregates to maintain their health. Nicotinamide mononucleotide adenylyltransferase 2 (NMNAT2) is a newly identified neuronal maintenance factor. We found that in humans, levels of NMNAT2 transcript are positively correlated with cognitive function and are negatively correlated with pathological features of neurodegenerative disease like plaques and tangles. In this study, we demonstrate that NMNAT2 can act as a chaperone to reduce protein aggregates, and this function is independent from its known function in the enzymatic synthesis of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD). We find that NMNAT2 interacts with heat shock protein 90 (HSP90) to refold protein aggregates, and that deleting NMNAT2 in cortical neurons renders them vulnerable to protein stress or excitotoxicity. Interestingly, the chaperone function of NMNAT2 protects neurons from protein toxicity, while its enzymatic function is required to defend against excitotoxicity. Our work here suggests that NMNAT2 uses either its chaperone or enzymatic function to combat neuronal insults in a context-dependent manner. In Alzheimer disease brains, NMNAT2 levels are less than 50% of control levels, and we propose that enhancing NMNAT2 function may provide an effective therapeutic intervention to reserve cognitive function.
