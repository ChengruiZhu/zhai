Biological neuromuscular systems are generally able to perform a specified movement task in several ways â€“ as they have significantly more degrees of freedom than mechanical constraints. Understanding how humans resolve these redundancies to drive individual muscles and tendons in typical joint movements is of interest in the fields of biomechanics, neuroscience and prosthetics. Many experimental studies have uncovered neural, mechanical and energetic features of individual muscle and tendon function in common tasks like walking and running. However, a unifying theoretical framework that explains the many independent empirical observations is yet to be established. In this work, we show that leg muscle-tendon morphology and neural co-ordination, together, enable efficient ankle movements in walking. This finding provides quantitative insight into the operation and performance of posterior-leg muscles and tendons in walking, and motivates the idea that different muscle-tendon units take on different mechanical roles to best actuate the ankle in gait. Results reported have implications both for better understanding neuromuscular co-ordination in gait, and for the design of lower limb prosthetic and orthotic technologies.
