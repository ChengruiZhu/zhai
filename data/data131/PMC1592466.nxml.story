A capillary-assembled microchip (CAs-CHIP), prepared by simply embedding square capillaries in a lattice polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) channel plate with the same channel dimensions as the outer dimensions of the square capillaries, has been used as a diffusion-based pretreatment attachment in capillary electrophoresis (CE). Because the CAs-CHIPs employ square-section channels, diffusion-based separation of small molecules from sample solutions containing proteins is possible by using the multilayer flow formed in the square section channel. When a solution containing high-molecular-weight and low-molecular-weight species makes contact with a buffer solution, the low-molecular-weight species, which have larger diffusion coefficients than the high-molecular-weight species, can be collected in a buffer-solution phase. The collected solution containing the low-molecular-weight species is introduced into the separation capillary to be analyzed by CE. This type of system can be used for CE analysis in which pretreatment is required to remove proteins. In this work a fluorescently labeled protein and rhodamine-based molecules were chosen as model species and a feasibility study was performed.
