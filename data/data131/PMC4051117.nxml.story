The mean ages of female and male subjects were 51.8 ± 10.8 and 53.2 ± 11.3 years respectively. The range and mean value of FBS in females were 113–342 mg/dl and 157.7 ± 6.3 mg/dl, while the range and mean value of PPBS in females were 135–560 mg/dl and 275.5 ± 12.3 mg/dl respectively. Results showed that range and mean value of FBS in males were 111–462 mg/dl and 160.8 ± 7.4 mg/dl, while the range and mean value of PPBS in males were 136–598 mg/dl and 302.1 ± 12.6 mg/dl respectively. Results of serum lipids showed that the mean values for total cholesterol (TC), triglyceride (TG), high density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) and very low density lipoprotein cholesterol (VLDL-C) in female patients were 202.2 ± 5.9 mg/dl, 168.3 ± 8.2 mg/dl, 44.9 ± 1.3 mg/dl, 123.6 ± 5.2 mg/dl and 33.7 ± 1.7 mg/dl respectively. The mean values for TC, TG, HDL-C, LDL-C and VLDL-C in male patients were 182.5 ± 4.8 mg/dl, 128.1 ± 10.8 mg/dl, 40.8 ± 1.2 mg/dl, 105.4 ± 4.8 mg/dl and 36.2 ± 2.2 respectively. FBS showed significant positive correlation with PPBS, cholesterol, TG, and VLDL-C. PPBS also demonstrated direct and significant correlations with TG and VLDL-C.
