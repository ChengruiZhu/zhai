The article we reprint describes a seemingly radical approach to a difficult problem: congenital elevation of the scapula (Sprengel’s deformity) [4]. Shrock noted the few previous attempts to address this problem were “…rather indefinite and in too many the results seemed discouraging. Most of the reports indicated considerable conservatism in the operative attack” [4]. He advocated “a far more radical procedure, but based upon the suggestions obtained from previous reports” [4]. As in earlier reports, he recommended sectioning the chondroosseous scapulothoracic bridge, but he then described a radical subperiosteal dissection of the scapula leaving the rhomboids, serratus magnus, and subscapularis muscles with the periosteal sleeve, then distally transplanting the entire scapula within that sleeve. (Interested readers can also see Campbell’s description in 1939 [1]). If this did not allow adequate drop of the scapula, he then performed an osteotomy at the base of the acromion. A postoperative dressing which maintained downward and backward pressure on the scapula was, he insisted, a critical detail. He reported two cases with good results in followup at 15 and 16 months postoperatively [4].
