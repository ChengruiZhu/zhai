Neurodegenerative lysosomal storage disorders (LSDs) are severe and untreatable recessive genetic disorders that cause devastating damage to the nervous system. These diseases exhibit severe disruption of lysosomes (a cellular organelle that breaks down lipids and proteins) and other aspects of cell function. However, the means by which mutations cause these dysfunctions are poorly understood. By studying different lipids that accumulate in three different LSDs, we found that lipids with specific shared structures are sufficient to cause multiple lysosomal and cellular dysfunctions, including an abnormal alkalization of the lysosomal pH. We prevented all of these dysfunctions by promoting lysosomal re-acidification and discovered several drugs—already approved for other purposes—with unexpected abilities to restore lysosomal pH and rescue cells. In a genetic mouse model of a severe LSD, one of these compounds decreased tissue damage, improved quality of life, and extended survival. In contrast with previous studies on individual disorders, our study provides novel shared principles relevant to several LSDs and uncovers relevant compounds able to provide multiple benefits in a disease-relevant model in vivo.
