Many young individuals undergoing hip arthroscopic surgery have hip chondropathy. The impact of mild or more severe hip chondropathy 1–2 years following arthroscopy is poorly understood. The purpose of this study was to (i) compare health-related quality of life (HRQoL), anxiety and depression scores between people who underwent arthroscopic treatment for hip chondropathy 1–2 years previously and pain-free controls; (ii) compare HRQoL, hip-related quality of life (QoL) and anxiety/depression scores in people with mild versus severe hip chondropathy and (iii) compare hip-related QoL items between chondropathy groups. The Hip disability and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (HOOS), International Hip Outcome Tool (iHOT-33), EuroQol-5D and Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) were compared between 71 individuals aged 18–60 years following arthroscopic treatment for hip chondroplasty (12–24 months previously) and 46 healthy controls. Comparisons were also performed between people with mild (Outerbridge grade 1–2) and severe (Outerbridge grade 3–4) hip chondropathy. Participants following arthroscopic treatment for hip chondroplasty reported worse HRQoL, hip-related QoL and anxiety, compared with pain-free controls (all
