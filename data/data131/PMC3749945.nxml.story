Protein-protein interactions are essential to communication and signal integration in cells. For these processes to be precise, interactions between proteins have to be specific and well coordinated. In order to understand the specificity in protein interactions, researches have focused on interfaces between two or more folded proteins. It has been shown that specificity in interactions between folded proteins relies on shape complementarity, hydrogen bonding, and salt-bridge formation. However, many proteins lack a unique folded structure; the so-called intrinsically disordered proteins. These proteins fluctuate between different conformations in isolation but often adopt a single structure when interacting with partner proteins. As many intrinsically disordered proteins are involved in signaling and regulation, their interactions have to be highly specific. The finding that the interaction interfaces of intrinsically disordered proteins are enriched in hydrophobic residues has led to questions regarding the specificity of interactions mediated by this group of proteins. Here, we show that polar and charged residues play a larger role in interfaces that involve intrinsically disordered proteins compared to interfaces that involve only folded proteins. Our results suggest that polar interactions are key contributors to the specificity of interactions that involve intrinsically disordered proteins.
