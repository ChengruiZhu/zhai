Cooperation is beneficial for the species as a whole, but, at the level of an individual, defection pays off. Natural selection is then expected to favor defectors and eliminate cooperation. This prediction is in stark contrast with the abundance of cooperation at all levels of biological systems: from bacterial biofilms to ecosystems and human societies. Several explanations have been proposed to resolve this paradox, including direct reciprocity and group selection. Our work, however, builds upon an observation that natural selection on cooperators might depend both on their relative frequency in the population and on the population density. We find that this feedback between the population and evolutionary dynamics can substantially increase the frequency of cooperators at the front of an expanding population, and can even lead to a splitting of cooperators from defectors. After splitting, only cooperators colonize new territories, while defectors slowly invade them from behind. Since range expansions are very common in nature, our work provides a new explanation of the maintenance of cooperation. More generally, the phenomena we describe could be of interest in other situations when coexisting entities spread in space, be it species in ecology or diffusing and reacting molecules in chemical kinetics.
