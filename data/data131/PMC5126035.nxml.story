Nine patients (7 women, 2 men; 31–51 [median, 43 (IQR 36–49) years old]) were included; none had a previously known pheochromocytoma. Six of them had medical histories suggestive of the diagnosis: palpitations and headaches for several months for four, multiple endocrine neoplasia syndrome type 1 for one and recurrent Takotsubo disease for one; at hospital admission, all were hypertensive despite cardiogenic shock. Three others had an identified surgical triggering factor. All nine patients rapidly developed refractory cardiogenic shock with very severe left ventricular (LV) impairment (LV ejection-fraction range 5–20%; LV outflow-tract velocity–time integral range 3–8 cm). Seven patients’ abdominal computed tomography scans showed pheochromocytoma-suggestive adrenal gland tumors (no scan during ICU stay for 2). Despite VA-ECMO implantation, three patients died of refractory multiple organ failure. For the six others, myocardial function improved and ECMO was removed 3–7 days post-implantation; α- and β-blockers were progressively introduced. Five survivors underwent pheochromocytoma excision 3 weeks–4 months post-ICU discharge, with satisfactory outcomes. One patient, whose pheochromocytoma was diagnosed 1 year after the index event, underwent uneventful surgical adrenalectomy. Systematic review retrieved 40 cases of pheochromocytoma-induced cardiogenic shock requiring mechanical support (mostly ECMO), with a mortality rate of 7%. Pheochromocytoma was removed surgically after mechanical support weaning in 31 patients and during mechanical support in 5. Four were not operated.
