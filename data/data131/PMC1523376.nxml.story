 the bacterium that is the main cause of tuberculosis (TB). In most people, the infection remains dormant, but every year eight million people develop active TB, usually in their lungs, and two million people die from the disease. For most of the second half of the 20th century, TB was in decline, particularly in developed countries, due to the availability of powerful antibiotics. Recently, however, global efforts to control TB have been set back by the HIV/AIDS epidemic—people with damaged immune systems are very susceptible to TB—and the emergence of antibiotic-resistant bacteria. In the 1990s, the World Health Organization (WHO) introduced DOTS as the recommended strategy for global TB control. Central to DOTS is “directly observed short-course chemotherapy.” To cure TB, several antibiotics have to be taken daily for 6 months. Patients must complete this treatment, even if they feel better sooner, to prevent relapse and the emergence of drug-resistant bacteria. The DOTS approach ensures that patients do this by having trained observers watch them swallow each dose of their medication for the entire 6-month period.This year, WHO and partners launched a renewed Global Plan to Stop TB, which aims to reduce, by 2015, the number of people who are sick with TB (disease prevalence) and the number of people who die each year from the disease (mortality) to half the 1990 levels. Because sick people often infect others, reducing disease prevalence will also reduce the number of new infections each year (disease incidence). The Global Plan to Stop TB includes a commitment to expand and intensify the DOTS strategy (in the year 2004, only around half of new active, infectious TB cases were detected under DOTS). The drug combinations currently used for DOTS consist of four or more different antibiotics, which have all been around and in use for many years. Recently, renewed effort has gone into the search for new TB treatments. Several candidate drugs have been identified and are now being tested, and scientists expect that some of them will be able to cure patients quicker than the current 6-month regimen. In this study, the researchers wanted to understand the potential benefits of such shorter treatments.Like all mathematical models, this one makes many assumptions that, if incorrect, will change the predictions. With this caveat, the study confirms that the planned scale-up of DOTS will greatly reduce TB incidence and mortality over the next few years. However, it also suggests that the impact of DOTS could be substantially improved by introducing shorter drug regimens. The earlier such shorter treatments become available, the greater their benefits would be. By reducing the opportunities for patients to default on their treatment and by shortening the period during which they can infect others, the researchers predict that the rate of decline in TB incidence and mortality could be up to three times higher for antibiotics that only have to be taken for 2 months compared with those that need to be taken for 6 months. But, they stress, strategies for reducing the global TB burden must strike a balance between pursuing new treatment and detection strategies and promoting wider implementation of proven strategies. And while there is hope that new shorter treatments will prove effective over the next few years, this will only become clear as candidates are rigorously tested.
