The gastrointestinal hormone ghrelin has important cardiovascular protective effects, however, its specific mechanisms are not yet completely understood. Recent studies have shown that the ghrelin receptor, growth hormone secretagogue receptor type 1a (GHSR-1a), regulates cell proliferation, apoptosis and inflammation-related signaling pathways. In human aortic endothelial cells, ghrelin activates NO production through AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and Akt activation, and these effects can be blocked by knockdown of GHSR-1a. Obese mice have been found to exhibit an increased GHSR-1a content and expression in the heart, associated with an increase in phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) content and an increase AKT content and phosphorylation. Furthermore, GHSR-1a expression was observed to be increased in heart failure after myocardial infarction (MI) in rats. Given such complexity in GHSR-1a signaling and crosstalk with the AMPK and PI3K/Akt signaling pathways, both of which are well-known factors involved in cardiac remodeling after MI, we speculate that GHSR-1a signaling may play a regulatory role in cardiac protection and hope to identify new drugs targets. However, to date, no direct association between GHSR-1a and cardiac remodeling has been found. Therefore, further studies are required.
