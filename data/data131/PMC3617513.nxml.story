Findings of the investigation show that majority of workers (93.33 per cent) were female and very few (6.66 per cent) were the male with the mean age of 24.53±6.43. The body mass index and aerobic capacity (lit/min) values were found as 21.40±4.13 and 26.02±6.44 respectively. Forty per cent of the respondents were having the physical fitness index of high average whereas 33.33 per cent of the respondents had low average physical fitness. All the assessed activities involved to make the quilt included a number of the steps which were executed using two types of work station i.e squatting posture on floor and standing posture using wooden table. A comparative study of physiological parameters was also done in the existing conditions as well as in improved conditions by introducing low height chair and wooden spreader to hold the load of quilt while working, to improve the work posture of the worker. The average working heart rate values were found to reduced by performing the activity using improved technology followed by energy expenditure (6.99 kj/min), total cardiac cost of work (1037.95 beats), physiological cost of work (103.79 beats) and rate of perceived rate of exertion to the score of 2.6 Results of postural analysis that is change in motion at cervical region reveal that range of motion in case of extension was found beyond the normal range in existing setup where as it reduced to normal range in improved work station.
