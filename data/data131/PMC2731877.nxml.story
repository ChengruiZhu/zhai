Within cells, fluctuations in molecule numbers are inevitable, since the synthesis and degradation of molecules are not synchronised. Such molecular noise can be transferred to other molecules through regulatory interactions. Noise in molecular networks, and especially in gene expression, has been studied extensively over the past years, both experimentally and through mathematical modelling. In this work, we present a theoretical framework that merges concepts derived from metabolic control analysis (which was originally developed to describe the control in metabolic pathways) with linear noise approximation (a concept from statistical physics). This framework is useful to analyse how noise propagates through molecular networks, how noise can be managed within the networks and how different network designs reduce or enhance noise. The present theory makes use of the natural, hierarchical organization of regulatory networks and makes their noise management more understandable in terms of network structure. Within this paper, we apply the framework to signaling and regulatory cascades, and analyse how feedback and time scale separation influence noise propagation in molecular networks.
