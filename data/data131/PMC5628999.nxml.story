These data provided a glimpse of the genetic diversity and variability of viral sequences without introducing the amplification biases produced when studying viromes. Metagenomes contain abundant viral material due to cells retrieved while undergoing viral lysis or as temperate viruses inserted in the chromosome. Using very stringent criteria, we have managed to assemble large viral genomes from Mediterranean metagenomes. This large-scale study using direct assembly from metagenomes, i.e. from the cellular fraction, clearly shows that metagenomes are an important tool to study environmental viral communities containing complementary information, which is missing in viromes, that should be taken into consideration when studying viral genetic diversity. Thus, in this study we have described more than 1,300 viral genomic fragments larger than 10Kb, of which 36 represented complete viral genomes, including the first deep sea virophage, one novel Marine Group II euryarchaeota virus (magrovirus) and others infecting Cyanobacteria, SAR11 or SAR116. All these new viral contigs were obtained from a collection of 24 metagenomes representing a broad range of geographical and ecological biomes from the Mediterranean Sea.
