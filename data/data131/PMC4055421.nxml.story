Functional versatility and structural adaptability of the Hsp90 chaperones are regulated by allosteric interactions that allow for diverse functions including modulation of ATP hydrolysis and binding with cochaperones and client proteins. By integrating molecular simulations and network-based approaches we have characterized conformational dynamics and allosteric interactions in different functional forms of Hsp90. The network centrality analysis and structural mapping of allosteric communications have revealed a small-world organization of the interaction network that is mediated by functionally important residues of the Hsp90 activity. We have found that effective allosteric communications in the Hsp90 chaperone may be provided by structurally stable residues that exhibit high centrality properties. Nucleotide-specific rewiring of the network topology and assortative organization of functional residues may protect the active form of the chaperone from random perturbations and detrimental mutations. These results have confirmed that allosteric interactions in the Hsp90 chaperone may be determined by a small-world network of functional residues that can regulate the network efficiency and resiliency by modulating the statistical ensemble of communication pathways in response to functional requirements of the ATPase cycle.
