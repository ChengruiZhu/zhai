Cancers are diseases of signaling networks. Transcription factor p53 is a pivotal node of a network that integrates a variety of stress signals and governs critical processes of DNA repair, cell cycle arrest, and apoptosis. Somewhat paradoxically, despite the fact that carcinogenesis is prevalently caused by p53 network malfunction, most of our knowledge about p53 signaling is based on cancer or immortalized cell lines. In this paper, we construct a mathematical model of intact p53 network to understand dynamics of non-cancerous cells and then dynamics of cancerous cells by introducing perturbations to the regulatory system. Cell fate decisions are enabled by the presence of interlinked feedback loops which give rise to a rich repertoire of behaviors. We explain and analyze by means of numerical simulations how the dynamical structure of the regulatory system allows for generating unambiguous single-cell fate decisions, also in the case when the cell population splits into an apoptotic and a surviving subpopulation. Perturbation analysis provides an explanation why cancer cell lines known to have vastly diverse expression levels of p53 regulators can exhibit a broad spectrum of responses to DNA damage.
