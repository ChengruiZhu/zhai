Unicellular organisms and other single cells often have to migrate towards food sources or away from predators by sensing chemicals present in the environment. There are two ways for a cell to sense these external chemicals: temporal sensing, where the cell senses the external chemical at two different time points after it has moved through a certain distance, or spatial sensing, where the cell senses the external chemical at two different locations on its cellular surface (e.g., the front and rear of the cell) simultaneously. It has been thought that small unicellular organisms employ temporal sensing as their small size prohibits sensing at two different locations on the cellular surface. Using computational modeling, we find that the choice between temporal and spatial sensing is determined by the ratio of cell velocity to the product of cell diameter and rate of signaling, as well as the diffusivities of the signaling proteins. Predictions from our model agree with experimental observations over a wide range of cells, where a fast-moving, small cell performs better comparing the chemoattractant at different times in its trajectory; whereas, a slow-moving, big cell performs better by comparing the chemoattractant concentration at its two ends.
