This study aimed to investigate the expression of the immediate-early response 5 (IER5) gene in cervical cancer tissues and explore the association between the expression of IER5 and the clinical outcomes of radiotherapy. We collected specimens by surgery or biopsy and obtained 53 specimens from tissues after radiotherapy and 16 specimens from tissues before radiotherapy. Immunohistochemistry and western blotting were used to assess the protein expression levels of IER5. Quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) was performed to assess the mRNA expression levels of IER5. The protein and mRNA expression levels of IER5 in cervical cancer patients treated with radiation doses â‰¥20 Gy were significantly higher than in those treated with radiation doses <20 Gy (P<0.05) and before treatment with radiotherapy. Moreover, the expression of IER5 was significantly positively correlated with the radiation dose (immunohistochemistry: r=0.548, P=0.019; qPCR: r=0.671, P=0.002; western blotting: r=0.573, P<0.0001). Radiotherapy induced the upregulated expression of IER5 and this was dependent on the radiation dose. However, the radiation-induced expression of IER5 was not associated with the clinical outcomes of radiotherapy in cervical cancer.
