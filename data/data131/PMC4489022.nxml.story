It remains unclear how the brain is able to track the location of moving objects by reading the spike trains received from the retina. To address this question, we recorded a large population of ganglion cells, the retinal output, in a dense patch of salamander and guinea pig retinas while displaying a bar moving in complex motion. From previous studies, the naive expectation was that individual ganglion cells would spike when an object was moving on their receptive field center and that the entire population’s activity would resemble a “hill” that continuously tracked the object’s location. However, our analysis revealed that this picture did not hold. Instead, ganglion cells fired sparsely and coded for the bar trajectory even when it was far from their receptive field center. Nevertheless, we showed that the bar’s position could be reconstructed from retinal activity with an accuracy better than the spacing between photoreceptors, when using more than 100 cells. We also showed that the retinal code was highly redundant, over-representing the same information more than 6-fold. Yet, this unexpected representation allowed for precise object tracking using a simple decoder, as long as the temporal structure of the spike trains was accounted for.
