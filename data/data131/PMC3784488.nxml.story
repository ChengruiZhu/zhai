Understanding how proteins recognize each other is central to deciphering the inner workings of living things and for biomedical research. It has long been known that the sequence of a protein, which is a string of different amino acids, can dictate how a protein molecule folds into a well-defined shape required for biological tasks. Many folded proteins recognize and bind with each other by a tight geometric fit similar to that between a lock and its key. Recently, however, it has become clear that some proteins function as a flexible string, in constant motion, without forming a stable shape. Understanding how such “disordered” proteins work is challenging. To gain insight, we studied a disordered protein region that causes a large family of human cancers. Employing an innovative combination of experimental and theoretical techniques, we describe a new mode of protein interaction based on multiple simple contacts between one type of amino acid (aromatic) in the disordered protein and another type (positively charged) on the partner protein. Because this mechanism also underlies the ability of the disordered protein to cause cancer, further investigation of this unprecedented mode of protein-protein interaction may open up new avenues for cancer therapy.
