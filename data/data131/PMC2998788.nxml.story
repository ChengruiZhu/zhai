Nitric oxide is one of many proinflammatory mediators that are involved in temporomandibular joint (TMJ) inflammatory disorder and is synthesized by inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS). iNOS is transcriptionally regulated by nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) in cases of inflammation, proliferation, and apoptosis. It has also been reported that nitric oxide is positively regulated by carrageenan and negatively regulated by hyaluronan in the knee joint. The aim of this study was to histologically evaluate how inflammation and cell proliferation of the synovial membrane are affected by the exogenous administration of carrageenan and hyaluronan in the rat TMJ by investigating iNOS, NF-κB, and anti proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) immunoreactivity. As results, immunoreactive cells to iNOS, NF-κB, and PCNA were normally localized only in the synovial membrane of wild type TMJs. The numbers of immunoreactive cells were extensively larger in the carrageenan-injected synovial membranes exhibiting excessive folding, and smaller in the hyaluronan-injected synovial membranes showing a few folds. These results indicate that a carrageenan injection induced inflammation and cell proliferation especially in the synovial membrane and that hyaluronan relieved the inflammation by decreasing inflammatory molecules in the synovial membrane.
