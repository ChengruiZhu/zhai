This study detected the expression level of IL-1β in gastric cancer tissue and paracarcinoma tissue, and also analyzed its relationship with clinical and pathological features, so as to explore the expression of IL-1β in gastric cancer tissue and its effect on gastric cancer. A total of 70 fresh primary gastric cancer tumors and corresponding paracarcinoma tissues away from the tumor-incision edge (≥5 cm) were selected from the First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University from January to December 2014. Total protein concentration was extracted from tissues with radioimmunoprecipitation assay lysis buffer, and IL-1β content in tissues was detected with enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The ratio of cell cytokine content and protein concentration was considered as the relative content of cytokines, and the relationship between relative content of cytokines and clinical data was analyzed. Results indicated that the differences in content of IL-1β in gastric cancer tissues and paracarcinoma tissues had no statistical significance, but the content of IL-1β would rise as tumor size was enlarged, based upon analysis (2.9<4.2 ng/g), and the difference was statistically significant (
