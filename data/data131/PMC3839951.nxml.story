Liposarcoma (LPS) is the most common soft tissue neoplasm in adults and is characterized by neoplastic adipocyte proliferation. Some subtypes of LPSs show aberrations involving the chromosome 12. The most frequent are t(12;16) (q13;p11) present in more than 90% of myxoid LPSs and 12q13-15 amplification in well-differentiated and dedifferentiated LPSs. In this region, there are important oncogenes such as CHOP (DDIT3), GLI, MDM2, CDK4, SAS, HMGA2, but also the HOXC locus, involved in development and tumor progression. In this study, we evaluated the expression of HOXC13, included in this chromosomal region, in a series of adipocytic tumors. We included 18 well-differentiated, 4 dedifferentiated, 11 myxoid and 6 pleomorphic LPSs as well as 13 lipomas in a tissue microarray. We evaluated the HOXC13 protein and gene expression by immunohistochemistry and quantitative PCR. Amplification/translocation of the 12q13-15 region was verified by FISH. Immunohistochemical HOXC13 overexpression was observed in all well-differentiated and dedifferentiated LPSs, all characterized by the chromosome 12q13-15 amplification, and confirmed by quantitative PCR analysis. In conclusion, our data show a deregulation of the HOXC13 marker in well-differentiated and dedifferentiated LPSs, possibly related to 12q13-15 chromosomal amplification.
