Calorie restriction improves healthy lifespan in all the organisms from yeast to mammals. However, our knowledge of the underlying mechanisms is still limited. The budding yeast naturally experiences calorie restriction when glucose in the rich medium is exhausted and cells start to consume the fermentation products before entering the stationary phase. Here, we demonstrate that the key for yeast cells to survive in the stationary phase is to accumulate sufficient storage carbohydrates (both trehalose and glycogen) during the transition phases. This accumulation requires the integration of starvation signals tranduced from multiple signaling pathways, including those activated by the inhibition of the major nutrient sensors (TOR/PKA), the energy-sensing complex (SNF1/AMPK), and the cell wall integrity pathway. We have also shown that the levels of intracellular reactive oxygen species and the population size are limited by those starvation signals downstream of TOR. Therefore, our data suggest that metabolic reprogramming to increase energy stores, anti-oxidant defence systems and population control are cooperatively activated by a set of key signaling proteins to ensure longevity in eukaryotic cells.
