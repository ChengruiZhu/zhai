A type of neural network called an “attractor network” is thought to underlie memory associations. Importantly, when such a network is presented with part of a memory, the network activity is attracted to the complete memory. However, it has been difficult to obtain clear experimental evidence for such attractor networks. Indeed, recent “morphing” experiments that were specifically designed to observe these attractor dynamics in the hippocampus did not obtain the expected results, leading to a controversy on the validity of the attractor hypothesis of memory. Here, we have built a computational model of the relevant hippocampal areas, including its core anatomical and physiological features, and through the use of large-scale computer simulations reveal in detail the physiological properties expected of the hippocampal attractor network during morphing experiments. We show that the experimental results obtained are actually those to be expected of an attractor network when the specifics of the experimental protocol are taken into account. Most importantly, the results directly demonstrate the attraction of CA3 activity to a stored pattern. Our results, together with previous behavioral and
