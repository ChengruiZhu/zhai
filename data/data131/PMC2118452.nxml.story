Caveolin-1 (Cav-1) is the principal structural component of caveolae organelles in smooth muscle cells, adipocytes, fibroblasts, epithelial cells, and endothelial cells (ECs). Cav-1–deficient (Cav-1 knockout [KO]) mice are viable and show increases of nitric oxide (NO) production in vasculature, cardiomyopathy, and pulmonary dysfunction. In this study, we generated EC-specific Cav-1–reconstituted (Cav-1 RC) mice and reexamined vascular, cardiac, and pulmonary phenotypes. Cav-1 KO pulmonary arteries had decreased smooth muscle contractility and increased endothelial NO synthase activation and hypotension; the latter two effects were rescued completely in Cav-1 RC mice. Cav-1 KO mice exhibited myocardial hypertrophy, pulmonary hypertension, and alveolar cell hyperproliferation caused by constitutive activation of p42/44 mitogen-activated protein kinase and Akt. Interestingly, in Cav-1 RC mice, cardiac hypertrophy and pulmonary hypertension were completely rescued, whereas alveolar hyperplasia was partially recovered because of the lack of rescue of Cav-1 in bronchiolar epithelial cells. These results provide clear physiological evidence supporting the important role of cell type–specific Cav-1 expression governing multiple phenotypes in the vasculature, heart, and lung.
