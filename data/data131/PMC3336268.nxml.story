Mizaj (Temperament) is one of the basic concepts ofUnani system of medicine upon which diagnosis and line of treatment of a disease are based. Every human being has been furnished a specific Mizaj through which an individual performs his functions properly. If it is disturbed, body becomes more susceptible to develop such diseases having same temperament as that of an individual. Objective of the study was to evaluate the relation of diseases in respect of Mizaj of the patients and to provide some knowledge for prevention of other diseases that may be related to identified Mizaj. Four hundred (400) patients fulfilling the criteria were enrolled in the study followed by their Mizaj were assessed by two pre structured proformas based on objective and subjective parameters given by Eminent Unani physicians. Following assessment of Mizaj of the patients, concordance between their Mizaj; Sue Mizaj Mufrad Sada (simple and single unbalanced temperament), Sue Mizaj Murakkab Sada (simple and compound imbalanced temperament) and Sue Mizaj Maaddi (imbalanced temperament due to humour) and disease was established, and it was observed that only patients of Sue Mizaj Barid (cold imbalanced temperament) and Sue Mizaj Balghami (imbalanced temperament due to phlegm) had significant concordance as compared to the rest. In the present study, non concordance between Mizaj and disease distribution may be attributed to those factors which tend to alter the Mizaj and have potential to produce diseases, like Mizaje Khilqi (congenital temperament), age, Masakin (residence), weather, diets, occupation and habit.
