Accumulated evidence has shown that the programmed cell death receptor 1/programmed cell death receptor 1 ligand 1 (PD-1/PD-L1) pathway is a promising therapeutic target for cancer immunotherapy. However, the association between PD-L1 and esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) patient survival remains unclear. We performed a meta-analysis to investigate the prognostic value of PD-L1 in ESCC. We searched PubMed, Embase, Web of Knowledge, and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials databases for relevant studies that evaluated PD-L1 expression and ESCC patient survival. Fixed- and random-effects meta-analyses were conducted according to the heterogeneity of the included studies. Sensitivity analysis was performed according to Metan-based influence analysis. Publication bias was evaluated using Egger’s and Begg’s tests. Overall, 13 studies with 2,877 patients were included. Twelve studies demonstrated the association between overall survival (OS), and 6 studies described the relation between disease-free survival (DFS). PD-L1 overexpression was found in 43.7% (1,258 of 2,877) of the patients with ESCC. High PD-L1 expression was associated with distant metastasis in patients with ESCC (
