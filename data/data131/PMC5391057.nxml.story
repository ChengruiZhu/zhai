Diabetes is a disease characterized by insulin deficiency resulting in glucose intolerance and in abnormalities of other metabolic fuels including protein. Recently, a number of studies have revealed that branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs) (leucine, isoleucine, and valine) play an important role in the regulation of protein synthesis by activating mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) in pancreatic Î² cells. BCAAs have positive effects on the regulation of glucose homeostasis. Leucine is an important nutrient signal as evidenced by recent observations, which showed increased fasting concentrations of circulating BCAAs being associated with an increased risk of type 2 diabetes (T2D) and insulin resistance in humans. Leucine seems to have direct effects on hypothalamic and brainstem functioning involved in satiety, which can potentially contribute to obesity and T2D. A number of observational studies indicate that elevated activity of BCAAs could be associated with poor metabolic health and T2D complications. Although these associations were consistently observed in humans, the mechanisms underlying this relationship remain to be completely understood. In this study, we have attempted to evaluate urinary excretion of leucine among patients of T2D and compared them with healthy controls by using a low-cost and non-invasive amino acid chromatography technique.
