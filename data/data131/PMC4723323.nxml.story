Bisphosphonates have demonstrated anti-tumour activity in preclinical studies of bone metastatic disease, thus it was natural to transition these agents into the adjuvant cancer therapy setting. Surprisingly, the results of adjuvant breast cancer trials have shown either modest to no benefit or even harm. We sought to explore whether the preclinical results supporting bisphosphonate use provided clues to help explain the current clinical data. Interestingly, the majority of preclinical data suggested that bisphosphonate treatment was more efficacious when administered after the establishment of osseous metastases. This is similar to the findings of one clinical study whereby patients with biopsy evidence of osseous micrometastases derive greater survival benefit from bisphosphonate treatment. Another clinical study found bisphosphonates were associated with increased incidence of visceral metastases, similar to what has been previously published in preclinical models using “preventative” dosing strategies. While the current clinical data suggest bisphosphonates may be more efficacious in post-menopausal or oestrogen depleted patients, or those with hormone receptor positive tumours, to date no appropriately designed preclinical studies have evaluated these effects. Furthermore, putative mechanisms that regulate response to bisphosphonates in other tumour types remain to be evaluated in breast cancer. Despite the initial optimism regarding adjuvant bisphosphonate therapy, the conflicting clinical results from large trials suggest that we should return to the bench to further investigate factors that may influence response to bisphosphonate treatment or identify appropriate characteristics that would indicate the sub-groups of patients most likely to benefit from bisphosphonate treatment.
