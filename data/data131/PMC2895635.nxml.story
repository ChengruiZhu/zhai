The most important way of conveying new findings in biomedical research is scientific publication. In turn, the most recent and most important findings can only be found by carefully reading the scientific literature, which becomes more and more of a problem because of the enormous number of published articles. This situation has led to the development of various computational approaches to the automatic extraction of important facts from articles, mostly concentrating on the recognition of protein names and on interactions between proteins (PPI). However, so far there is little agreement on which methods perform best for which task. Our paper reports on an extensive comparison of nine recent PPI extraction tools. We studied their performance in various settings on a set of five different text collections containing articles describing PPIs, which for the first time allows for an unbiased comparison of their respective effectiveness. Our results show that the tools' performance depends largely on the collection they are trained on and the collection they are then evaluated on, which means that extrapolating their measured performance to arbitrary text is still highly problematic. We also show that certain classes of methods for extracting PPIs are clearly superior to other classes.
