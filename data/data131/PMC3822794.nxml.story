-microglobulin (B27TR) develop a multisystem inflammatory disease resembling human inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and spondyloarthropaties (SpA). Tumour necrosis factor α (TNF-α) has a crucial role in sustaining chronic inflammation in the gut and joints. The aim of this work was to evaluate whether TNF-α blockade could prevent or reduce the inflammation of peripheral joints in B27TR. A first group of 9-week-old B27TR received an anti-TNF-α monoclonal antibody (mAb) or an isotypic IgG2a,k up to the age of 18 weeks. An untreated group was monitored up to the age of 18 weeks and then randomly assigned to a 9-week treatment with anti-TNF-α mAb or IgG2a,k. Each rat was monitored for clinical IBD and peripheral joint manifestations. After sacrifice the colon and hind paws were examined for macroscopical and microscopical pathological changes. Early TNF-α blockade prevented, and late treatment improved IBD signs in B27TR. Erythema, oedema, inflammatory infiltrate close to the tendons and enthesis, proliferating chondrocyte-like cells, signs of new endochondral bone ossification and bone erosion were observed in peripheral joints of four out of six IgG2a,k-treated B27TR, both at 18 and 27 weeks. Immunopositivity for phosphorylated Smad1/5/8 indicated that the process of joint remodelling was activated in B27TR. Some entheses showed chondroid nodules. Anti-TNF-α treatment reduced inflammation and preserved the enthesis organization in most animals. Occasional and transient erythema and oedema were still present in three of six of the late anti-TNF-α-treated animals. Smad1/5/8 signalling was not inhibited by late anti-TNF-α treatment. In B27TR, articular involvement follows IBD onset and develops at entheses. Early TNF-α blockade prevents the onset of IBD and consequently the development of enthesitis in peripheral joints in the B27TR model of human SpA.
