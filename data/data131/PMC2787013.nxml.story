Genomes contain sequences that encode both gene products and the instructions for where and when each gene is expressed. This gene expression code is critical for normal development and goes awry in disease processes such as cancer. The gene expression code is interpreted by proteins called transcription factors that bind to particular DNA sequences and carry instructions for gene activation or repression. This recognition code is challenged by the presence of highly-similar transcription factors that prefer almost identical DNA sequences. In addition, studies in living cells indicate that individual transcription factors have significant flexibility in sequence recognition. Here, we identify thousands of positions in the genome of human T cells that are bound by the transcription factor ETS1. These data, along with comparisons to other genomic datasets, allow us to identify DNA sequences that specify ETS1 binding while excluding binding of other related transcription factors. Furthermore, we discover that ETS1 binds more than one sequence and that these sequence variants can predict distinct biological functions of ETS1. Thus, this work contributes to our understanding of the gene expression code by addressing both how a transcription factor can bind unique genomic locations and why a transcription factor binds multiple DNA sequences.
