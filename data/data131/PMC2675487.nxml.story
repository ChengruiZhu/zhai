Microarrays allow researchers to monitor the gene expression patterns for tens of thousands of genes across a wide range of cellular responses, phenotype and conditions. Selecting a small subset of discriminate genes from thousands of genes is important for accurate classification of diseases and phenotypes. Many methods have been proposed to find subsets of genes with maximum relevance and minimum redundancy, which can distinguish accurately between samples with different labels. To find the minimum subset of relevant genes is often referred as biomarker discovery. Two main approaches, filter and wrapper techniques, have been applied to biomarker discovery. In this paper, we conducted a comparative study of different biomarker discovery methods, including six filter methods and three wrapper methods. We then proposed a hybrid approach, FR-Wrapper, for biomarker discovery. The aim of this approach is to find an optimum balance between the precision of the biomarker discovery and the computation cost, by taking advantages of both filter method’s efficiency and wrapper method’s high accuracy. Our hybrid approach applies Fisher’s ratio, a simple method easy to understand and implement, to filter out most of the irrelevant genes, then a wrapper method is employed to reduce the redundancy. The performance of FR-Wrapper approach is evaluated over four widely used microarray datasets. Analysis of experimental results reveals that the hybrid approach can achieve the goal of maximum relevance with minimum redundancy.
