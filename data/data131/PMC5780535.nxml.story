The exposure of HeLa cells to interleukin-1 alpha (IL-1α) in the presence of cycloheximide (CHX) leads to the release of active tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α), eliciting cytocidal effect on these cells. A mass spectrometry (MS)-based analysis of the qualitative proteomic profiles of the HeLa cells treated only with IL-1α, CHX or simultaneously with IL-1α and CHX, in comparison to an untreated control, enabled to distinguish protein candidates possibly involved in this process. Among them protein disulphide isomerase (PDI) seemed to be particularly interesting for further research. Therefore, we focused on quantitative changes of PDI levels in HeLa cells subjected to IL-1α and CHX. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was employed for determination of PDI concentrations in the investigated, differently treated HeLa cells. The obtained results confirmed up-regulation of PDI only in the cells stimulated with IL-1α alone. In contrary, the PDI levels in HeLa cells exposed to both IL-1α and CHX, where apoptotic process was intensive, did not increase significantly. Finally, we discuss how different expression levels of PDI together with other proteins, which were detected in this study, may influence the induction of cytotoxic effect and modulate sensitivity to cytotoxic action of IL1.
