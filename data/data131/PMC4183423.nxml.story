During interphase, chromosomes occupy discrete bodies within the cell nucleus termed chromosome territories (CT). The organization of CT and the genes within them have been implicated in genomic regulation. Numerous reports suggest that specific interchromosomal interactions enable distally located genes to cluster in close proximity for coordinately regulated gene activity. Our overall understanding of CT organization and their interchromosomal interactions, however, is very limited. We have addressed this issue by combining the approaches of 3D FISH (fluorescence in situ hybridization), an extensive computational program that enables us to obtain precise measurements of CT interactions in 3-D and a novel global data mining program that evaluates the overall arrangement of all the interacting CT. 7 CT pairs ranging in size and gene density were examined in two different human cell types. Our findings demonstrate that: 1) there are preferred interchromosomal networks that are altered across the cell cycle; 2) these alterations are cell type specific; 3) all the CT interact with a similar number of other CT with the exception of the gene rich CT17 which interacts with significantly more CT; and 4) multiple interactions in the four possible combinations between CT pairs are far more common than in random simulations.
