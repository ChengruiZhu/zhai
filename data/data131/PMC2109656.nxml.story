We have labeled exposed surface glycoproteins of mouse lymphoid cells by the galactose oxidase-tritated sodium borohydride technique. The labeled glyco-proteins were separated by polyacrylamide slab gel electrophoresis and visualized by autoradiography (fluorography). The major thymocyte surface proteins have molecular weights of 170,000 and 125,000. Thymocytes from TL antigen-positive mouse strains showed an additional band with a molecular weight of 27,000. Highly purified T lymphocytes contain two major surface glycoproteins with molecular weights of 180,000 and 125,000. Purified B lymphocytes have one major surface glycoprotein with a molecular weight of 210,000. When T lymphocytes are stimulated in vitro by concanavalin A or phytohemag- glutinin, the major proteins characteristic of T cells are relatively weakly labeled, but new components of lower molecular weights appear on the cell surface. A similar change is seen in B lymphocytes stimulated by Escherichia coli lipopolysaccharide. T lymphoblasts isolated from mixed lymphocyte cultures show a slightly different surface glycoprotein pattern. A polypeptide with a molecular weight of 57,000, which was labeled without enzymatic treatment by tritiated sodium borohydride alone, is strongly labeled in proliferating cells.
