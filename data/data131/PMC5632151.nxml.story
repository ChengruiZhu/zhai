Among the 119 patients (174 eyes) identified (2.5% of the population screened), 80% were male; of which 63% were MSM. Mean presenting logMAR visual acuity was 0.70 (20/100 Snellen) and unilateral ocular involvement occurred in 54%. Ocular manifestations included interstitial keratitis (24 eyes), anterior uveitis (37 eyes), intermediate uveitis (17 eyes), posterior uveitis (31 eyes), panuveitis (27 eyes), isolated optic nerve involvement (25 eyes), and others (12 eyes) including VI nerve palsy, scleritis, and episcleritis. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) examination was done in 65 (55%) patients. Of those, VDRL was positive in 14 (22%) patients; white blood cells and proteins were elevated in, respectively, 28 (43%) and 39 (60%) of patients. HIV status was unknown in 39 (33%) patients; among those whose serology were performed (or previous status was known), 38 (48%) were HIV infected. Intravenous aqueous penicillin G was administered in 69 (58%), intramuscular benzathine penicillin in 25 (21%) and other antibiotics, mainly due to allergy, in three (3%) patients. Treatment allowed a visual improvement of –0.22 logMAR (gain of five lines on Snellen chart) after a mean follow-up period of 19 months.
