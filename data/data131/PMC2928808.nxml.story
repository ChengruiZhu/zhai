Single rare causal alleles and/or collections of multiple rare alleles have been suggested to create “synthetic associations” with common variants in genome-wide association studies (GWAS). This model predicts that associations with common variants will not be consistent across populations. In this study, we examined 19 T2D variants for association with T2D risk in 6,142 cases and 7,403 controls from five racial/ethnic populations in the Multiethnic Cohort (European Americans, African Americans, Latinos, Japanese Americans, and Native Hawaiians). In racial/ethnic pooled analysis, all 19 variants were associated with T2D risk in the same direction as previous reports in Europeans, and the sum total of risk variants was significantly associated with T2D risk in each racial/ethnic group. The consistent associations across populations do not support the Goldstein hypothesis that rare causal alleles underlie GWAS signals. We also did not find evidence that these markers underlie racial/ethnic disparities in T2D prevalence. Large-scale GWAS and sequencing studies in these populations are necessary in order to both improve the current set of markers at these risk loci and identify new risk variants for T2D that may be difficult, or impossible, to detect in European populations.
