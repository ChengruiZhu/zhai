Loss of genome integrity underlies aspects of aging and human disease. During DNA replication, two parallel signaling pathways play important roles in the maintenance of genome integrity. One pathway detects DNA damage, while the other senses replication stress. Both pathways activate responses that include arrest of cell cycle progression, giving cells time to cope with the problem. These pathways have been defined by treating cells with compounds that induce either replication stress or DNA damage, but little is known about their roles during unperturbed DNA replication. They may be important when several adjacent replication origins fail to initiate and forks from flanking origins must replicate longer regions of DNA than normal to complete replication. We have used a derivative of budding yeast chromosome III lacking all efficient replication origins to identify mutants that preferentially destabilize this chromosome fragment, which mimics a chromosome with a large inter-origin gap. We found that the DNA damage response pathway, but not the replication stress response pathway, plays an important role in maintaining this fragment. The signal recognized in this case may be replisome failure rather than forks stalled at endogenous DNA damage.
