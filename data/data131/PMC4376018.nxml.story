The anti-metabolite chemotherapeutic, gemcitabine is relatively effective for a spectrum of neoplastic conditions that include various forms of leukemia and adenocarcinoma/carcinoma. Rapid systemic deamination of gemcitabine accounts for a brief plasma half-life but its sustained administration is often curtailed by sequelae and chemotherapeutic-resistance. A molecular strategy that diminishes these limitations is the molecular design and synthetic production of covalent gemcitabine immunochemotherapeutics that possess properties of selective “targeted” delivery. The simultaneous dual selective “targeted” delivery of gemcitabine at two separate sites on the external surface membrane of a single cancer cell types represents a therapeutic approach that can increase cytosol chemotherapeutic deposition; prolong chemotherapeutic plasma half-life (reduces administration frequency); minimize innocent exposure of normal tissues and healthy organ systems; and ultimately enhance more rapid and thorough resolution of neoplastic cell populations. Materials and Methods: A light-reactive gemcitabine intermediate synthesized utilizing succinimidyl 4,4-azipentanoate was covalently bound to anti-EGFR or anti-HER2/
