Cell migration is involved in vital processes like morphogenesis, regeneration and immune system responses, but can also play a central role in pathological processes like metastasization. Computational models have been successfully employed to explain how single cells migrate, and to study how diverse cell-cell interactions contribute to tissue level behavior. However, there are few models that implement realistic cell shapes in multicellular simulations. The method we present here is able to reproduce two different types of motile cellsâ€”amoeboid and keratocyte-like cells. Amoeboid cells are highly motile and deform frequently; many cells can act amoeboid in certain circumstances e.g., immune system cells, epithelial cells, individually migrating cancer cells. Keratocytes are (fish) epithelial cells which are famous for their ability to preserve their shape and direction when migrating individually; during wound healing, keratocytes migrate collectively, in sheets, to the site needing reepithelialization. Our method is computationally simple, improves the realism of multicellular simulations and can help assess the tissue level impact of specific cell shapes. For example, it can be employed to study the tissue scanning strategies of leukocytes, the circumstances in which cancer cells adopt amoeboid migration strategies, or the collective migration of keratocytes.
