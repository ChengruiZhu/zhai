Cells rely on complex networks of protein-protein interactions in order to carry out life functions. Scientists believe that these networks are organized in a modular fashion; that is they are made up of functionally distinct parts like an electronic circuit. Modularity implies that just as we put together electronic parts to make an amplifier that we can use in many different circuits, we can put together biochemical reactions to make an amplifier, or a switch or an oscillator, which perform the same function in different organisms. This assumption is important in synthetic biology, where we engineer and assemble synthetic genetic circuits in living organisms in a modular fashion. We show that for important modules like genetic and signaling switches, the assumption of modularity has a crucial limitation. We show that if one simply connects a biological switch to another downstream circuit, the presence of the connection changes the operation of the switch, which in some cases may stop behaving like a switch. Our work underscores the importance of taking into account these downstream connections and suggests that natural systems may be balancing some of these components in order to ensure that despite diversity, modules continue to work in different systems with fidelity.
