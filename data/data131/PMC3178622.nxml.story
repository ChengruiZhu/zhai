One of the key challenges facing evolutionary theory is understanding how cooperation and communication evolve in social systems. In many situations cooperation leads to higher net benefits to all, but a population of cooperators is vulnerable to invasion from exploitative strategies. When foraging, aiding others through sharing information can lead to an advantage to a collective of communicating individuals. How this behaviour can be maintained and resist invasion without centralized control or policing is currently not clear. In this work, we examine a social foraging system where individuals evolve to signal to conspecifics when they locate a resource. We show that in some environments, cooperative signalling is sustained through a form of indirect reciprocation, as a signalling phenotype is more likely to be the beneficiary of a signal from a conspecific in the future. This effect naturally occurs as a result of the foraging dynamic and, depending on the environment, such as how resources are distributed and how difficult they are to track, will compensate for relatively large costs of signalling. Through simulations and a simplified model we examine the parameters driving this process and identify the mechanisms required for cooperation to evolve in such a system.
