Facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy is caused by the deletion of a subset of D4Z4 macrosatellite repeats on chromosome 4. Each repeat contains a retrogene encoding the double-homeobox factor DUX4. We show that this retrogene is normally expressed in human testis, most likely the germ-line cells, and pluripotent stem cells. DUX4 expression is epigenetically suppressed in differentiated tissues and the residual DUX4 transcripts are spliced to remove the carboxyterminal domain that has been associated with cell toxicity. In FSHD individuals, the expression of the full-length DUX4 transcript is not completely suppressed in skeletal muscle, and possibly other differentiated tissues, and results in a small percentage of cells expressing relatively abundant amounts of the full-length DUX4 mRNA and protein. We therefore propose that FSHD is caused by the inefficient developmental suppression of the DUX4 retrogene and that the residual expression of the full-length DUX4 in skeletal muscle is sufficient to cause the disease. Therefore, FSHD represents the first human disease to be associated with the incomplete developmental silencing of a retrogene array that is normally expressed early in development.
