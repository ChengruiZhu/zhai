Cancer is a disease that develops over decades as result of accumulation of abnormalities in the genomes of otherwise normal cells. Cells in tumors compete for space and resources. Those cells able to survive the Darwinian struggle for existence within tissues progressively evolve uncontrolled growth and in some cases this results in cancer. Aspirin and other non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) reduce death rate from multiple types of cancer by about 20%. However, the mechanisms by which NSAIDs act to prevent cancer are not fully understood. By examining thirteen individuals with Barrett's esophagus over time, we showed that the rate of accumulation of genomic abnormalities decreased when most individuals started taking NSAIDs. We also observed that, surprisingly, the number of abnormalities in the Barrett's tissues did not increase much over decades. However, in one individual who progressed to esophageal cancer, we observed massive genomic abnormalities affecting 19% of the genome. These findings suggest that NSAIDs may prevent cancer by reducing the accumulation of genomic abnormalities over time and that detection of stable versus unstable genomes may be used in the clinic to help manage treatment options in Barrett's esophagus.
