Our sex chromosomes have profoundly differentiated since evolving from an ancestral pair of non-sex chromosomes (autosomes). In this study, we first show that X chromosome–derived retrogenes (genes that arose as duplicates of “parental” X-linked genes) are specifically expressed during the meiotic and postmeiotic stages of spermatogenesis, thus functionally replacing their parents during, but also after, the process of male meiotic sex chromosome inactivation (MSCI). We then show that the “export” of retroposed gene copies from the X chromosome started rather recently during mammalian evolution, on the eutherian (“placental” mammal) and marsupial lineages, respectively. This suggests that MSCI—the main driving force for this out of the X gene “movement”—originated around the separation of these two major (therian) mammalian lineages, approximately 180 million years ago. Given that MSCI was likely triggered as soon as the proto-X and -Y chromosomes ceased to recombine (an event that marks the origin of these sex chromosomes), our data also support the recent notion that our sex chromosomes and those of other therians emerged, not in the common ancestor of all mammals, but—probably rather late—in the therian ancestor.
