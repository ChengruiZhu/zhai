Epithelial cells which line the intestine form finger-shaped structures called crypts; these undergo a process of renewal at the base, causing cells to migrate upwards until they die and are sloughed off into the gut. Much of our understanding of how crypts function rests upon two processes: proliferation, in which cells divide to produce ‘daughter cells’; and differentiation, in which cells become progressively more specialised as they migrate along the crypt axis and mature. Coordinated proliferation and differentiation enable each crypt to renew itself and to produce a range of specialised cell types essential to its healthy functioning. In this paper we build a mathematical model for two reaction pathways which regulate proliferation and differentiation. We use this model to explore how crosstalk between these pathways in cell pairs influences the generation of distinct cell fates in intestinal tissues. By modifying our model to represent abnormal, ‘mutant’ cells, we investigate abnormalities typical of early colorectal cancer. Computational simulation of our model identifies an important region of crosstalk in our reaction network which determines whether cells adopt the same fate as one another, or different fates. Our model may prove useful for realistic simulations of whole crypts in the future.
