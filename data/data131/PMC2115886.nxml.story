Lymphocyte migration from the blood into most secondary lymphoid organs is initiated by a highly selective adhesive interaction with the endothelium of specialized blood vessels known as high endothelial venules (HEV). The propensity of lymphocytes to migrate to particular lymphoid organs is known as lymphocyte homing, and the receptors on lymphocytes that dictate interactions with HEV at particular anatomical sites are designated "homing receptors". Based upon antibody blockade experiments and cell-type distribution studies, a prominent candidate for the peripheral lymph node homing receptor in mouse is the approximately 90-kD cell surface glycoprotein (gp90MEL) recognized by the monoclonal antibody MEL-14. Previous work, including sequencing of a cDNA encoding for this molecule, supports the possibility that gp90MEL is a calcium-dependent lectin-like receptor. Here, we show that immunoaffinity-purified gp90MEL interacts in a sugar-inhibitable manner with sites on peripheral lymph node HEV and prevents attachment of lymphocytes. Lymphocyte attachment to HEV in Peyer's patches, a gut- associated lymphoid organ, is not affected by gp90MEL. The results demonstrate that gp90MEL, as a lectin-like receptor, directly bridges lymphocytes to the endothelium.
