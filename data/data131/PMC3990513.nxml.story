G-protein coupled receptors constitute a family of drug targets of outstanding interest, with more than 30% of the marketed drugs targeting a GPCR. The combination of site-directed mutagenesis, biochemical experiments and computationally generated 3D structural models has traditionally been used to investigate these receptors. The increasing number of GPCR crystal structures now paves the way for detailed characterization of receptor-ligand interactions and energetics using advanced computer simulations. Here, we present an accurate computational scheme to predict and interpret the effects of alanine scanning experiments, based on molecular dynamics free energy simulations. We apply the technique to antagonist binding to the neuropeptide Y receptor Y1, the structure of which is still unknown. A structural model of a Y1-antagonist complex was derived and used as starting point for computational characterization of the effects on binding of alanine substitutions at thirteen different receptor positions. Further, we used the model and computational scheme to predict the binding of a series of seven antagonist analogs. The results are in excellent agreement with available experimental data and provide validation of both the methodology and structural models of the complexes.
