The structure of an unknown biological system is uncovered by experimentally perturbing the system with a series of input signals. The response to these perturbations is measured as output signals. Then, the mathematical relation between the input and the output signals constitutes a model for the system. As a result, a classification of biological molecular networks can be devised using their input–output functional relation. This article studies the input–output functional form for the response to heat shocks in mammalian cells. The Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) mammalian cells were perturbed with a series of heat pulses of precise duration and temperature. The experimental data, taken at the single-cell level, revealed a simple and precise mathematical law for the time evolution of the heat shock response. Parameters of the mathematical law can be experimentally measured and can be used by heat shock biologists to classify the heat shock response in different experimental conditions. Since the response to heat shock is the outcome of a transcriptional factor control, it is highly probable that the empirical law is valid for other biological systems. The mathematical model explains not only the mean value of the response but also the time evolution of its probability distribution in a cell population.
