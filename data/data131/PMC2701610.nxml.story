Neurons, or nerve cells in the brain, communicate with each other using stereotyped electric pulses, called spikes. It is believed that neurons convey information mainly through the frequency of the transmitted spikes, called the firing rate. In addition, neurons may communicate some information through the finer temporal patterns of the spikes. Neuronal firing patterns may depend on cellular organization, which varies among the regions of the brain, according to the roles they play, such as sensation, association, and motion. In order to examine the relationship among signals, structure, and function, we devised a metric to detect firing irregularity intrinsic and specific to individual neurons and analyzed spike sequences from over 1,000 neurons in 15 different cortical areas. Here we report two results of this study. First, we found that neurons exhibit stable firing patterns that can be characterized as “regular”, “random”, and “bursty”. Second, we observed a strong correlation between the type of signaling pattern exhibited by neurons in a given area and the function of that area. This suggests that, in addition to reflecting the cellular organization of the brain, neuronal signaling patterns may also play a role in specific types of neuronal computations.
