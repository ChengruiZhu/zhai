Intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM-1) protein is an important adhesion molecule that facilitates metastasis on one hand, and on the other hand supports the immunological synapse necessary for T-cell mediated elimination. The expression pattern of ICAM-1 in melanoma was studied more than two decades ago, mainly in cell lines or in unmatched melanoma specimens. By using real time PCR we could not demonstrate a clear difference in ICAM-1 mRNA levels between primary melanocytes and primary cultures of metastatic melanoma. However, immunohistochemistry staining of progression tissue microarray comprised of samples of different disease stages derived from different patients, demonstrated a dramatic ICAM-1 upregulation particularly upon the transition from primary tumor to lymph node metastasis. There was no significant difference between lymph node and distant metastases. Importantly, these results were confirmed in an independent tissue microarray comprised of patient-paired specimens from progressive stages of the patientâ€™s disease. These data indicate that ICAM-1 upregulation is required to initiate the lymphatic spread of melanoma (Stage III) but no further increase is associated with progression to remote organs (Stage IV).
