Renal epithelial cells damaged by ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) can be restored by timely and appropriate treatment. Recent studies have reported that intra renal adult kidney stem cells contribute to the restoration of tubules damaged by I/R. Here, we determined the role of adult tubular cells in the restoration of damaged tubules. We labeled slow cell-cycle cells (SCCs) with 5-bromo-2'-deoxyuridine (BrdU) and investigated their location in the kidneys as well as their contribution to the restoration of tubular cells damaged by I/R injury in mice. Thirty minutes of bilateral ischemia resulted in severe disruption of tubular epithelial cells along with a decline in renal function. The post-ischemic disruption of tubular epithelial cells was most severe in the S3 segment of the outer stripe of the outer medulla. Damaged tubules demonstrated gradual recovery of renal function over time. BrdU-labeled SCCs were mainly observed in tubules located at the junction of cortex and outer medulla, as well as in the inner medulla. The tubular SCCs expressed functional tubule cell markers such as Na/K-ATPase, Na-K-Cl cotransporter-2, and aquaporin 1 and 2. BrdU-labeled SCCs survived I/R injury and proliferated. These results demonstrate that SCCs present in tubules contribute to the restoration of tubular epithelial cells injured by I/R.
