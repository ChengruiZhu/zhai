Kinesins are molecular motors which work when they bind to tracks called microtubules (MTs). In a cell, cargoes of kinesins are transported to very distant destinations compared to a short transport ability of single kinesins. To study this difference, we establish a novel quantitative model capable of capturing the transport by teams of kinesins. While an entire team does not completely dissociate from a MT easily, individual kinesins continuously bind and unbind from MTs. Because the binding occurs faster than the unbinding process, the transported distance increases significantly over the number of kinesins in the team. Another barrier on cellular transport is the disturbance to the motion of the cargo by other cytoplasmic particles. Thus, we also consider the effect of cellular particles by exerting temporary high resisting loads on the cargo. Our model predicts that kinesins remain bound on the MT for a long time when the high resisting loads act on them. This behavior increases the probability that other unbound kinesins rebind to MTs. Consequently, more kinesins can participate in the transport. Then, the cargo is able to overcome interruption by other cellular particles. Thus, a robust intracellular transport can be realized by this mechanism.
