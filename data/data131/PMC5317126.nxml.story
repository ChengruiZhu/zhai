Interventional sialendoscopy has become the predominant therapeutic procedure for the management of obstructive salivary disorders, but only a few multicentre studies of large series of patients with a long-term follow-up have been published. This Italian multicentre study involved 1152 patients (553 females; mean age 50 years) who, after at least a clinical and ultrasonographic evaluation, underwent a total of 1342 diagnostic and interventional sialendoscopies, 44.6% of which involved the parotid gland. 12% (n = 138) of patients underwent multiple treatments. The procedure was successful in 1309 cases. In 33 cases (2.4%) the procedure could not be concluded mainly because of complete duct stenosis (21 cases). Salivary stones were the main cause of obstruction (55%), followed by ductal stenosis and anomalies (16%), mucous plugs (14.5%) and sialodochitis (4.7%). Complete therapeutic success was obtained in 92.5% of patients after one or more procedures, and was ineffective in < 8%. Untoward effects (peri and postoperative complications) were observed in 5.4% of cases. Sialendoscopy proved to be an effective, valid and safe procedure in the diagnostic and therapeutic management of non-neoplastic obstructive salivary gland diseases.
