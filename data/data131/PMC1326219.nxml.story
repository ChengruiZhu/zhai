An important goal of current biological research is annotation of human genes with relevant descriptors and properties. One critical property of interest to biologists and medical researchers is the subcellular localization of gene products, as this affects a protein's biological role and our ability to use it as a therapeutic target. This study used a microarray-based functional genomic method that allows rapid, large-scale identification of subcellular localization, enabling the authors to annotate the localization of thousands of previously uncharacterized human gene products. The authors then provide an example of how these data can be used by applying them to the search for tumor-specific markers. Using data from hundreds of DNA microarray profiles of global gene expression patterns in tumors and normal tissues, they identify candidate genes encoding membrane-associated and secreted proteins that are highly overexpressed in tumors and that might therefore be particularly good targets for diagnostic tests or molecular therapies. Diagnostic tests based on these markers could potentially enable cancers to be detected earlier than is currently possible, and molecular therapies targeting the products of these genes could have high specificity for the corresponding cancers.
