Using site-directed mutagenesis we introduced the R132H mutation into the murine glioma cell line GL261, creating mIDH1-GL261. Presence of the mutation was confirmed by immunoblotting and production of the oncometabolite 2-hydroxyglutarate (2HG), demonstrated by mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) performed on cell supernatant. In vitro mIDH1-GL261 had different morphology but similar growth rate than parental GL261 (p-GL261). After intracranial injection, MRI suggested that the initial growth rate was slower in mIDH1-GL261 than p-GL261 gliomas but overall survival was similar. mIDH1-GL261 gliomas showed evidence of R132H expression and of intratumoral 2HG production (evaluated by MRS and LC-MS/MS). Immunizations were performed nine days after intracranial implantation of mIDH1- or p-GL261 cells by three subcutaneous injections of five different peptides encompassing the IDH1 mutation site, all emulsified with Montanide ISA-51, in association with GM-CSF. Control mice were injected with four ovalbumin peptides or vehicle. Mice with mIDH1-GL261 but not p-GL261 gliomas treated with mIDH1 peptides survived longer than controls; 25% of them were cured. Immunized mice showed higher amounts of peripheral CD8+ T cells, higher production of IFN-γ, and evidence of anti-mIDH1 antibodies. Immunizations led to intratumoral up-regulation of IFN-γ, granzyme-b and perforin-1 and down-regulation of TGF-β2 and IL-10.
