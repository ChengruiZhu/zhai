A total of 152 patients (66% males; mean age: 67.6 years) were consecutively enrolled, and 44 (29%) had CKD. During the follow-up period (median: 3 years; interquartile range: 1-4), 27 patients (18%) reached endpoints. The numbers of patients per endpoint were as follows: all-cause mortality 14, ischemic stroke 9, hemorrhagic stroke 2 and aortic dissection 2. Patients with CKD were significantly older (77 vs. 64 years; p < 0.001), had higher serum creatinine (0.96 vs. 0.65 mg/dl; p < 0.001), higher brain natriuretic peptide (51.1 vs. 18.5 pg/ml; p < 0.001) and a higher National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score on admission (3 vs. 2; p < 0.001), and were less likely to have modified Rankin Scale scores of 0-2 after stroke onset (52 vs. 77%; p = 0.003). Patients with white matter hyperintensity [odds ratio (OR) 3.0; 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.5-6.2; p = 0.003] and those with microbleeds (OR 2.5; 95% CI: 1.2-5.1; p = 0.015) had more pronounced CKD than the remaining patients. A Kaplan-Meier curve analysis showed that patients with CKD had a less favorable outcome than those without CKD (p < 0.001). The multivariate Cox proportional-hazards analysis revealed that CKD was associated with recurrent stroke, cardiovascular events or all-cause mortality (hazard ratio 2.22; 95% CI: 1.12-4.25; p = 0.02).
