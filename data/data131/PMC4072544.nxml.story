Evolutionary innovation through mutation is important for adaptation, thus ultimately survival of all species. Proteins, the main actors of cellular life, are generally only marginally stable in the cell and sensitive to mutations. This raises the question how the emergence of new functions is balanced with the destabilizing effect of mutations. Here, we incorporate biophysical knowledge on the stability effect of mutations into an extended model of protein evolution to better understand at the proteome level factors that promote non-conservative, more likely destabilizing mutations. Our analyses reveal a central role of molecular chaperones, specialized quality control enzymes that are known to promote protein evolvability by buffering the destabilizing effect of mutations in individual substrates. We find that chaperones support non-conservative mutations at the proteome level both directly, and through stabilizing intrinsically disordered proteins. We demonstrate how the main co- and post-translationally acting chaperones distinctly promote the same non-conservative mutations that characterize the re-wiring of protein interactions. Our results thus suggest how energetically costly protein quality control pathways can systematically promote the evolution of protein networks, and highlight the importance of considering the cellular context for understanding protein and proteome evolution.
