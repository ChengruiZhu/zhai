Endothelial cell (EC) metabolism has lately emerged as a novel and promising therapeutic target to block vascular dysregulation associated with diseases like cancer and blinding eye disease. Glycolysis, fatty acid oxidation (FAO) and, more recently, glutamine/asparagine metabolism emerged as key regulators of EC metabolism, able to impact angiogenesis in health and disease. ECs are highly glycolytic as they require ATP and biomass for vessel sprouting. Notably, a regulator of the glycolytic pathway, 6-phosphofructo-2-kinase/fructose-2,6-bisphosphatase 3, controls vessel sprouting during the angiogenic switch and its inhibition in tumour ECs leads to vessel normalization, thereby reducing metastasis and ameliorating chemotherapy. Moreover, FAO promotes EC proliferation through DNA synthesis, and plays an essential role in lymphangiogenesis via epigenetic regulation of histone acetylation. Pathological angiogenesis was decreased upon blockade of carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1, a regulator of FAO in ECs. More recently, metabolism of glutamine, in conjunction with asparagine, was reported to maintain EC sprouting through TCA anaplerosis, redox homeostasis, mTOR activation and endoplasmic stress control. Inactivation or blockade of glutaminase 1, which hydrolyses glutamine into ammonia and glutamate, impairs angiogenesis in health and disease, while silencing of asparagine synthetase reduces vessel sprouting
