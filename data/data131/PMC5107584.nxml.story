Fissural cysts (FC) are caused by entraped epithelium between nasal and maxilar processes. They are commonly treated with surgical enucleation precedded or not by marsupialization depending on the cyst size. Biopsy of lesion is recommended due to confirm radiographic evaluation. It is rare to observe Le Fort I surgical approach to this type of injury. This study reports the case of an uncommon grand proportions fissural cyst in a female patient, 53, that was referred to the Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery Departament of Hospital XV presenting volume increase in maxilla associated with numbness of palate. Radiograph examination showed an intimate relationship between incisors apexes and FC. Expansion of both buccal and palate cortical was then confirmed as well as its unusual size, approximately 25 millimeters. Due to the abnormal size of lesion and possible impairment of upper incisors, LeFort I osteotomy associated with downfracture to cystic enucleation was the chosen treatment. After enucleation, the remaining space was filled with BIOSs and bioguide (lyophilized bone and collagen membrane). Patientsâ€™ twelve months follow-up demonstrate no relapses and maintenance of teeth involved.
