Chromosomal translocations generate chimeric proteins by fusing segments of two distinct genes and are frequently associated with cancer. The proteins involved are large and fairly heterogeneous in sequence and typically have only a few dispersed structural domains connected by long uncharacterized regions. It has never been studied from a structural perspective how these chimeras survive losing significant portions of the original proteins and acquire new oncogenic functions. By analyzing a collection of 406 human translocation proteins we show here that the answer to both questions lies to a large extent in the high level of structural disorder in the fusion partner proteins (on average, they are twice as disordered as all human proteins). The translocation breakpoints usually avoid globular domains. In rare cases when a globular domain is truncated by the fusion, it happens at a location in the domain where the hydrophobicity exposed by the split is favorable (i.e., not too high). Disorder on average is significantly higher in the vicinity of the breakpoint than in the rest of the fusion proteins. Disorder also plays a pivotal role in the acquired oncogenic function by bringing distant/disparate fusion segments together that enables novel intra- and/or intermolecular interactions.
