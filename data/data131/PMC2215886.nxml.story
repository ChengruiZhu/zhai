Partial extraction of troponin C (TnC) decreases the Ca2+ sensitivity of tension development in mammalian skinned muscle fibers (Moss, R. L., G. G. Giulian, and M. L. Greaser. 1985. Journal of General Physiology. 86:585), which suggests that Ca2+-activated tension development involves molecular cooperativity within the thin filament. This idea has been investigated further in the present study, in which Ca2+- insensitive activation of skinned fibers from rabbit psoas muscles was achieved by removing a small proportion of total troponin (Tn) complexes. Ca2+-activated isometric tension was measured at pCa values (i.e., -log[Ca2+]) between 6.7 and 4.5: (a) in control fiber segments, (b) in the same fibers after partial removal of Tn, and (c) after recombination of Tn. Tn removal was accomplished using contaminant protease activity found in preparations of LC2 from rabbit soleus muscle, and was quantitated using sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and scanning densitometry. Partial Tn removal resulted in the development of a Ca2+-insensitive active tension, which varied in amount depending on the duration of the extraction, and concomitant decreases in maximal Ca2+-activated tensions. In addition, the tension-pCa relation was shifted to higher pCa values by as much as 0.3 pCa unit after Tn extraction. Readdition of Tn to the fiber segments resulted in the reduction of tension in the relaxing solution to control values and in the return of the tension-pCa relation to its original position. Thus, continuous Ca2+-insensitive activation of randomly spaced functional groups increased the Ca2+ sensitivity of tension development in the remaining functional groups along the thin filament. In addition, the variation in Ca2+-insensitive active tension as a function of Tn content after extraction suggests that only one- third to one-half of the functional groups within a thin filament need to be activated for complete disinhibition of that filament to be achieved.
