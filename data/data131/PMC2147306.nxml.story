 cyanide and with a high titer T6 lysate. It was found in some of the later experiments that the T6 lysate is essential only during the first half of the latent period. Cyanide alone will induce lysis during the latter part of the latent period. Using this method on T4-infected bacteria it is found that during the first half of the latent period no phage particles, not even those originally infecting the bacteria, are recovered. This result is in agreement with the gradually emerging concept that a profound alteration of the infecting phage particle takes place before reproduction ensues. During the second half of the latent period mature phage is found to accumulate within the bacteria at a rate which is parallel to the approximately linear increase of intracellular DNA in this system. However, the phage production lags several minutes behind DNA production. When 5-methyltryptophan replaced cyanide as the metabolic inhibitor, similar results were obtained. The curves were, however, displaced several minutes to the left on the time axis. The results are compared with Latarjet's (16) data on x-radiation of infected bacteria and with Foster's data (18) concerning the effect of proflavine on infected bacteria. Essential agreement with both is apparent.
