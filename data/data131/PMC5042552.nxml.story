The article describes a new concept to help match donor organs to recipients for kidney transplantation. The concept relies on the ability to measure the individual DNA of potential donors and recipients. When the data about genomes (i.e., DNA) of possible donors and recipients are available, the article describes how data can be computationally compared to identify differences in these genomes and quantify the possible future impact of these differences on the functioning of the graft. The concept presented in the article determines a score for each pair of possible donor and recipient. This score is called the allogenomics mismatch score. The study tested the ability of this score to predict graft function (the ability of the graft to filter blood) in the recipient several years after transplantation surgery. The study found that, in three small sets of patients tested, the score is a strong predictor of graft function. Prior studies often assumed that only a small number of locations in the genome were most likely to have an impact on graft function, while this study found initial evidence that differences across DNA that code for a large number of proteins can have a combined impact on graft function.
