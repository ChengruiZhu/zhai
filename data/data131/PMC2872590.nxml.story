Treatment outcome data generated in prospective trials are intrinsically biased due to necessary selection criteria. Therefore the results obtained may not reflect the actual impact of current treatment options for an unselected general population. We analysed the treatment modalities and the outcome in 212 consecutive patients with non small cell lung cancer stages IIIB and IV who were seen in a community based oncology group practice between 6/1995 and 6/2006. 93 presented with stage IIIB and 119 with stage IV. Chemotherapy was given to 194/212 patients (92%), 114 patients (54%) received palliative radiation at one point during treatment. Treatment consisted of chemotherapy only in 86 patients (40%) and radiation only in 6 patients. 12 patients received best supportive care only. Patients with stage IIIB have survival rates at 12, 24 and 36 months of 64%, 27% and 21% respectively and for patients with stage IV the survival rates at 12, 24 and 36 months are 40%, 19% and 11% respectively. The median survival for stages IIIB and IV is 16 and 11 months respectively. In a multivariate analysis incorporating the factors stage (IIIB vs. IV), age (<70 vs. ≥70 years) and performance status (WHO 0/1 vs. 2/3) only stage and performance status were independent factors for survival. These retrospective data concerning analysis of survival, response rates and toxicity in a community setting confirm published results of phase II–III studies and indicate that results generated in prospective trials can be transferred into routine care.
