 and was located on the medial femoral condyle in 63 patients (63%). Fifty-one percent of OATs were isolated, while 49% were performed with concomitant procedures including meniscus allograft transplantation (MAT) in 27 (27%). Fifty-three patients (53%) returned to the operating room at an average 2.8±2.7 years, with 26% of these patients (14/53) undergoing additional reoperations (range, 1-3 additional reoperations). Arthroscopic debridement was performed in 91% of the initial reoperations (48/53); 55% of reoperations (29/53) were performed within 2 years of the index OAT. Twenty patients (20%) were considered failures at an average 4.0±2.7 years following index OAT either due to revision OAT (N=6), conversion to arthroplasty (N=10), or appearance of poorly incorporated allograft at arthroscopy (N=4). Patients requiring multiple reoperations had an odds ratio of 7.25 (95% CI, 1.85 to 28.37) of OAT failure (P=0.004), while patients requiring secondary surgery within 2 years had an odds radio of 1.35 (95% CI, 0.48 to 3.82) for OAT failure (P>0.05). Patients with concomitant MAT and OAT were more likely to progress to failure (odds ratio 2.4, 95% CI 0.87 to 3.28). Excluding the failed patients, statistically and clinically significant improvements were found in all outcomes assessments at final follow-up, including Lysholm, IKDC, KOOS, and SF-12 (P<0.001 for all).
