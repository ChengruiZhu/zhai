Folds are considered to be the structural units which make up the protein universe. Structural classification schemes focus on the assignment and organisation of protein domains into folds. However, they do not suggest how different folds might relate to one another in a global way. We introduce the concept of bridges through fold space: significant similarities between these units. We consider four alignment methods and a dynamic approach to placing these bridges. A greater consensus between these methods cannot be achieved by simply increasing the stringency with which edges are assigned. Instead, we emphasise the importance of considering consensus maps and only report results where there is agreement across all networks. It is possible that a study of the bridges may reveal evolutionary relationships. Based on a phylogenetic analysis of structures, we find that bridges consistently fall between folds which evolved at similar times. Moreover, the landscapes all consist of a core of older folds, with younger structures more often seen at the periphery. Finally we identify four pivotal folds in the landscapes. They contain topological motifs which unite disparate regions of fold space.
