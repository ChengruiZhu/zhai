Artificial insemination (AI) can serve as a powerful tool to the sheep owners for making rapid genetic progress of their flock. The AI in sheep is mostly performed using fresh semen with two reasons i) lambing rate following trans-cervical AI with frozen semen is limited by the inability of frozen-thawed sperm to transit the cervix and ii) the need of circumventing the cervical barrier through laparoscope aided intrauterine AI. Therefore, AI with frozen-thawed semen is not as widespread in sheep as it is in other domestic species. However, to get maximum benefits through the use of AI, frozen-thawed semen is a prerequisite because instead of high fertility, the short shelf life of fresh semen coupled with a limitation on the number of insemination doses achievable per unit time restricts the widespread use of individual sires. Therefore, in order to enhance lambing rate, a total of 240 trans-cervical artificial inseminations with frozen-thawed semen were performed in Bharat Merino ewes during autumn season either once in the evening (G-I, 10 h after onset of estrus, n = 100) or twice (G-II, 14 h and 22 h after onset of estrus, n = 140) i.e. once in the morning and again in the evening.
