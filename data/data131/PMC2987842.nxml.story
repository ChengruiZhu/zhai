The way potentially infectious contacts are made strongly influences how fast and how widely epidemics spread in their host population. Therefore, it is important to assess changes in contact behavior throughout an epidemic; these may occur due to external factors, such as demographic change, or as a side effect of the epidemic itself, leading to an accumulation of individuals with risky behavior in the infected population. We have developed a mathematical framework that allows for the study of the mutual interdependencies between epidemic spread and changes in contact behavior. The method is used to study HIV epidemics in model populations. We address the question of whether HIV is primarily spread by highly contagious initially infected hosts or by less contagious latently infected hosts who will, however, encounter more situations for potential transmission. The answer to this question strongly depends on the concurrency of contacts and the maturation stage of the epidemic. Initially infected hosts are major epidemic spreaders in populations with strongly concurrent contacts and during epidemic expansion whereas otherwise latently infected hosts play a more important role. The availability of better data for parameterization will make this approach relevant for public health considerations.
