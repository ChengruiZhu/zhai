Brain Machine Interfaces (BMIs) decode motor instructions from neuro-physiological recordings and feed them to bio-mimetic effectors. Many applications achieve high accuracy on a limited number of tasks by applying statistical methods to these data to extract features corresponding to certain motor instructions. We built a bio-prosthetic avian vocal organ. The device is based on a low-dimensional mathematical model that accounts for the dynamics of the bird's vocal organ and robustly relates smooth paths in a physiologically meaningful parameter space to complex sequences of vocalizations. The two physiological motor gestures (sub-syringeal pressure and ventral syringeal muscular activity), are reconstructed from the bird's song, and the model is implemented on a portable Digital Signal Processor to produce synthetic birdsong when driven by a freely behaving bird via the sub-syringeal pressure gesture. This exemplifies the plausibility of a type of synthetic interfacing between the brain and a complex behavior. In this type of devices, the understanding of the bio-mechanics of the periphery is key to identifying a low dimensional physiological signal coding the motor instructions, therefore enabling real-time implementation at a low computational cost.
