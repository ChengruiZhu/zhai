Cripto-1 can promote tumourigenesis and may be a potential prognostic biomarker in several malignancies, yet little is known about this protein in lung adenocarcinoma (LAC). The aim of this study was to evaluate the prognostic value of cripto-1 expression in a cohort of patients with LAC. Tumours from 290 patients with pathologically confirmed LAC were used for an immunohistochemical analysis of cripto-1 expression. The correlation between cripto-1 expression and the clinicopathological parameters of patients, EGFR-TKI sensitivity was analysed. Significant associations between cripto-1 expression and pT status, pN status, pTNM status, E-cadherin expression and EGFR-TKI sensitivity were identified. Compared with patients with low cripto-1 expression, patients with high cripto-1 expression exhibited significantly poorer progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS). Moreover, multivariate analyses showed that high cripto-1 expression was an independent predictor of worse survival of patients with LAC. The combination of cripto-1 expression and serum CEA level was correlated with both PFS and OS. In conclusion, cripto-1 may be a potential prognostic biomarker of survival in patients with LAC.
