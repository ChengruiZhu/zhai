To study the possible role of the nuclear matrix in chromosome territory organization, normal human fibroblast cells are treated in situ via classic isolation procedures for nuclear matrix in the absence of nuclease (e.g., DNase I) digestion, followed by chromosome painting. We report for the first time that chromosome territories are maintained intact on the nuclear matrix. In contrast, complete extraction of the internal nuclear matrix components with RNase treatment followed by 2 M NaCl results in the disruption of higher order chromosome territory architecture. Correlative with territorial disruption is the formation of a faint DNA halo surrounding the nuclear lamina and a dispersive effect on the characteristically discrete DNA replication sites in the nuclear interior. Identical results were obtained using eight different human chromosome paints. Based on these findings, we developed a fractionation strategy to release the bulk of nuclear matrix proteins under conditions where the chromosome territories are maintained intact. A second treatment results in disruption of the chromosome territories in conjunction with the release of a small subset of acidic proteins. These proteins are distinct from the major nuclear matrix proteins and may be involved in mediating chromosome territory organization.
