Three different ways of shifting the pCa/tension curve on the pCa axis have been studied and related to changes in the rate constants of the cross-bridge cycle. The curve midpoint shifts to higher pCa's when the substrate (Mg-ATP) is reduced from 5 to 0.25 mM, when the phosphate concentration is reduced from 7.5 mM to 0, and when the ionic strength is reduced from 0.200 to 0.120. The Hill coefficients of the pCa/tension curve in our standard saline (5 mM substrate, 5 mM free ATP, 7.5 mM phosphate, ionic strength 0.200, 15 degree C) are between 5.1 and 5.6 and fall to 3.0 with the left shift of the curve brought about by reducing both substrate and phosphate. Left shifts of the curve produced by reduction in the ionic strength do not result ina lower Hill coefficient. Reducing eigher substrate or phosphate is associated with a reduction in the optimal frequency for oscillatory work, but reduction in ionic strength is not so associated. Maximum tension increases with the left shift of the curve brought about by reducing phosphate concentration or ionic strength, but tension decreases with the left shift of the curve accompanying substrate concentration reduction in phosphate-free saline. We argue that one mechanism for the observed shift of the curve along the pCa axis is the relationship between the time a cross-bridge takes to complete a cycle and the time Ca2+ stays bound to troponin C (TnC). If the cycle rate is decreased, a smaller fraction to TnC sites must be occupied to keep a given fraction of cross-bridges active. To illustrate this concept, we present a simplified model of the cross-bridge cycle incorporating the kinetics of Ca binding to TnC.
