 8.0. 2. Heating to 49° or 50°C. is accompanied by a critical increase in the permeability of the cells to the dye. 3. The injury caused by lack of oxygen can be demonstrated by the increase in the number of stained cells. 4. The addition of serum to suspensions of thymus cells or tonsil lymphocytes greatly inhibits the diffusion of the trypan into the cells. The protection afforded is roughly proportionate to the amount of serum added. Gelatin also exerts a marked protective influence; egg albumin affords a partial protection; starch and gum arabic are inert. Hemoglobin and cholesterol do not modify the stainability of the cells. Arsenious sulfide in weak concentrations partially inhibits the diffusion of the dye. Colloidal iron is without effect, and is precipitated about the cells. 5. The toxicity of the photodynamic substance, hematoporphyrin, and of an impure chlorophyll solution in the presence of sunlight could be strikingly demonstrated by the greatly increased permeability of the cells to the stain. 6. Acute and chronic inanition produces an increased fragility of the cells. The protective power of the serum in acute starvation appears to be increased. 7. The small thymus cells of old animals are more readily injured than are those of young ones, as indicated by the increased proportion of stained cells. 8. The method has been applied to the demonstration of the action of cytotoxic immune sera for rat thymus cells and for human tonsil lymphocytes
