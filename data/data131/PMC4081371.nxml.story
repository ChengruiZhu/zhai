Esophageal granular cell tumors (GCTs) are rare and often misdiagnosed. To demonstrate their clinicopathological features, the present study reports 19 cases and reviews the literature. There were 11 female and eight male esophageal GCT patients with a median age of 42.0 years. All the tumors were solitary. The majority of patient indications for endoscopy (89.5%) were non-specific and endoscopic therapy was performed in 17 cases with a relapse in one case after a 12-month follow-up. The endoscopic appearance of esophageal GCT was variable and the majority of tumors (80.0%) were located in the middle and lower esophageal segments. The size of the tumors ranged from 0.4 to 2 cm in diameter and the surface was white-gray, pink or yellow. Nine patients underwent an endoscopic ultrasound exam, eight of which demonstrated hypoechoic echostructures with a smooth margin and intracavity growth features. One case was derived from the muscularis propria layer with an irregular margin and intra- and extra-cavity growth features. The histological features could mimic other tumors and immunohistochemical stains are usually positive for S-100, periodic acid-Schiff, neuron-specific enolase and nestin. Three cases indicated pleomorphism and Ki-67 was locally positive. Esophageal GCTs are rare and endoscopic ultrasound features are variable. Immunohistochemical staining may aid in the diagnosis.
