We measured the energy expenditure weekly in patients undergoing a pylorus preserving pancreatoduodenectomy for bile duct cancer or pancreatic tumors. Twelve patients (5 women and 7 men; mean age 70.1 years) were enrolled in this study, and their resting energy expenditure levels were determined by indirect calorimetry. In these patients, a significant correlation was observed between the measured resting energy expenditures and the predicted resting energy expenditures calculated by the Harris-Benedict equation. The resting energy expenditures measured before surgery were almost the same as the predicted resting energy expenditures (measured resting energy expenditure: 22.4 ± 3.9 kcal/kg/day vs predicted resting energy expenditure: 21.7 ± 2.0 kcal/kg/day). The measured resting energy expenditure/predicted resting energy expenditure ratio, which reflects the stress factor, was 1.02 ± 0.10. After the pylorus preserving pancreatoduodenectomy, a significant increase in energy expenditure was observed, and the measured resting energy expenditure was 25.7 ± 3.5 kcal/kg/day on postoperative day 7 and 25.4 ± 4.9 kcal/kg/day on postoperative day 14. The measured resting energy expenditure/predicted resting energy expenditure ratio was 1.16 ± 0.14 on postoperative day 7, and 1.16 ± 0.18 on postoperative day 14 respectively. In conclusion, patients undergoing a pylorus preserving pancreatoduodenectomy showed a hyper-metabolic status as evaluated by their measured resting energy expenditure/predicted resting energy expenditure ratio. From our observations, we recommend that nutritional management based on 30 kcal/body weight/day (calculated by the measured resting energy expenditure×activity factor 1.2–1.3) may be optimal for patients undergoing a pylorus preserving pancreatoduodenectomy.
