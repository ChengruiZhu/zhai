Fatal chemotherapy-induced hepatitis B virus reactivation (HBV-R) is a well-described serious complication observed in patients with lymphoma and resolved HBV infection. The aim of the present study was to determine the predictive factors of the development of chemotherapy-induced HBV-R. A total of 77 consecutive newly diagnosed patients with lymphoma and resolved HBV infection, who received chemotherapy from 2007 through 2015 were analysed retrospectively. Significant predictive factors associated with HBV-R were identified based on the data from these patients. Ten patients developed HBV-R during and following chemotherapy, and two of these 10 patients developed HBV-associated hepatitis flares. There was a significant negative correlation between anti-hepatitis B core (HBc) titres prior to chemotherapy and time to HBV-R (P=0.016, R=âˆ’0.732). Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses demonstrated that anti-HBc and anti-hepatitis B surface (HBs) titres at baseline were significant predictive factors for HBV-R. In addition, patients with high anti-HBc titres at baseline (above 10 S/CO) were significantly more likely to experience HBV-R than patients with low anti-HBc and high anti-HBs titres (above 28 mIU/ml), who did not experience complete reactivation (P<0.0001). Furthermore, patients with low anti-HBs titres were significantly more likely to experience HBV-R than those with high anti-HBs titres (P=0.031). All HBV-R episodes among the patients with high anti-HBc titres occurred within 3 months following the initiation of chemotherapy. The combination of anti-HBc and anti-HBs titres, as opposed to either titre alone, at baseline in patients with lymphoma may serve as a surrogate marker for the occurrence of HBV-R under the influence of chemotherapy.
