Ten Indian wheat varieties viz. RSP-566, RSP-561, PBW-396, HD-2687, C-306, PBW-175, RSP-81, PBW-550, DBW-17 and WH-542 were characterized for grain nutritional quality parameters viz., macronutrients (viz. starch, protein, protein fractions, sugars, fat), essential elements (calcium, phosphorus, iron and zinc), carotenoids, antioxidant and antinutritional parameters (phytic acid, total phenol, polyphenol oxidase (PPO) and trypsin inhibitor). RSP-561 possessed highest starch content, total protein, albumin, globulin, microelements (iron and zinc) and lowest antinutritional phytic acid and its grain contained second highest values of gluten (gliadin + glutenin), calcium, carotenoids and antioxidant contents and second lowest in antinutritional total phenol, PPO, trypsin inhibitor compositions. HD-2687 showed highest content of albumin, gliadin and total phenol constituents besides highest starch and total protein content. PBW-175 had highest sugar, calcium and carotenoids. However, antinutritional trypsin inhibitor, total phenol and PPO were found lowest in RSP-566, PBW-550 and RSP-81 respectively. The finding of this study concludes that on the basis of overall nutritional status, RSP-561 genotypes can be selected as one of best genotypes.
