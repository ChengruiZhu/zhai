Age-based VRP were reported by 77/104 (74%), symptom-based by 101 (97%), and outbreak-specific by 78 (75%). VRP were also implemented in the emergency department by 5 (5%), outpatient clinic by 9 (9%), day surgery by 6 (6%), or radiology by 3 (3%). Symptom-based VRP were seasonal in 24 (24%) of facilities, with 71 (70%) implemented year-round.

Communication of VRP to staff occurred by email for 79 (77%), by meetings for 56 (55%) and by signage in staff only areas for 50 (49%). Enforcement was the responsibility of nursing (82, 80%), registration clerks (59, 58%), unit clerks (54, 53%), the infection prevention team (32, 31%), or clinicians (16, 16%). The effectiveness of VRP was assessed by 63 (62%) through active surveillance of hospital acquired respiratory infections; 29 (28%) used active surveillance of healthcare worker exposures and 30 (29%) used patient/family satisfaction.
