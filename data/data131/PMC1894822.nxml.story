It is now widely recognized that learning and memory rely on activity-dependent plastic modifications of the synaptic and intrinsic properties of individual neurons. Experimental studies have identified numerous molecules that are necessary for the induction and the maintenance of plastic modifications, including activity-dependent kinase and phosphatase (aKP) cycles. In contrast, the mechanisms that govern information storage in neurons remain obscure. Prevailing theoretical models either account for the rapid onset (models of plasticity) or for the protracted maintenance (models of memory) of plastic modifications, but have failed to embody both properties. We show in a biophysical model that the ubiquitous upstream activation of aKP cycles by neuronal activity is sufficient to generate information storage that combines rapid induction and maintenance with lifetimes compatible with animal and human memory. Moreover, aKP cycles exhibit essential information storage properties consistent with experimental data, including bidirectional plasticity, graded memory, and robustness to stochastic molecular fluctuations. The aKP model offers a realistic unified framework in which cellular plasticity and memory can be interpreted as two modes of a single process where dynamics depends on neuronal activity. This new principle is dynamic in essence and challenges the widespread idea that memory reflects stability in biological systems.
