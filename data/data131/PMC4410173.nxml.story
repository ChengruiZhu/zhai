Juvenile Pagetâ€™s disease (JPD) is a rare autosomal-recessive condition. It is diagnosed in young children and characterized by a generalized increase in bone turnover, bone pain, and skeletal deformity. Our patient was diagnosed after a pathological fracture when she was 11 years old. When we first examined her at the age of 30 she had bone pain and deformity in both the femur and tibia. Serum alkaline phosphatase (ALP) level, radiology, bone scintigraphy, and densitometry were monitored. Next generation sequencing (NGS) technology, namely semiconductor sequencing, was used to determine the genetic background of JPD. Seven target genes and regions were selected and analyzed after literature review (TM7SF4, SQSTM1, TNFRSF11A, TNFRSF11B, OPTN, CSF1, VCP). No clear pathogenic mutation was found, but we detected missense polymorphisms in CSF1 and TM7SF4 genes. After treatment with zoledronic acid, infusion bone pain and ALP level decreased. We can conclude that intravenous zoledronic acid therapy is effective and safe for suppressing bone turnover and improving symptoms in JPD, but the long-term effects on clinical outcomes are unclear. Our findings also suggest that NGS may help explore the pathogenesis and aid the diagnosis of JPD.
