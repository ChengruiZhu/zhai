Forces within the surgical milieu or circulation activate cancer cell adhesion and potentiate metastasis through signaling requiring FAK-Akt1 interaction. Impeding FAK-Akt1 interaction might inhibit perioperative tumor dissemination, facilitating curative cancer surgery without global FAK or AKT inhibitor toxicity. Serial truncation and structurally designed mutants of FAK identified a seven amino acid, short helical structure within FAK that effectively competes with Akt1-FAK interaction. Adenoviral overexpression of this FAK-derived peptide inhibited pressure-induced FAK phosphorylation and AKT-FAK coimmunoprecipitation in human SW620 colon cancer cells briefly exposed to 15mmHg increased pressure, consistent with laparoscopic or post-surgical pressures. Adenoviral FAK-derived peptide expression prevented pressure-activation of SW620 adhesion not only to collagen-I-coated plates but also to murine surgical wounds. A scrambled peptide did not. Finally, we modeled operative shedding of tumor cells before irrigation and closure by transient cancer cell adhesion to murine surgical wounds before irrigation and closure. Thirty minute preincubation of SW620 cells at 15mmHg increased pressure impaired subsequent tumor free survival in mice exposed to cells expressing the scrambled peptide. The FAK-derived sequence prevented this. These results suggest that blocking FAK-Akt1 interaction may prevent perioperative tumor dissemination and that analogs or mimics of this 7 amino acid FAK-derived peptide could impair metastasis.
