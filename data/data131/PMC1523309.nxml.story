The question of how proteins fold into their three-dimensional native conformations continues to be a subject of considerable interest, in large part because misfolding or aggregation of proteins is associated with a number of important diseases. Most previous research has focused on how proteins refold from denatured conformations in vitro, and much of the experimentally observed behavior has proven to be explicable with molecular simulations performed on computers. Recently attention has begun to move toward understanding protein folding as it occurs in vivo, which development requires, among other things, consideration of potential interactions with chaperonins and non-specific crowding effects due to the high macromolecular concentrations encountered in physiological conditions. Also under increasing consideration experimentally is the possibility that proteins might begin to fold while being synthesized (i.e., cotranslational folding), and the purpose of this work is therefore to develop and apply a first molecular simulation strategy capable of modeling this process. The simulations thus described, while not free of assumptions and approximations, nevertheless provide some intriguing glimpses into how the process of protein folding might be modulated through coupling to synthesis within the large ribosomal subunit.
