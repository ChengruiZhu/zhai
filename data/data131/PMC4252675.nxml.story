Vitiligo is a chronic disorder characterized by depigmented macules which can slowly enlarge with the concurrent development of new lesions. Although autologous suction blister epidermal grafting is an established technique for the treatment of recalcitrant, stable vitiligo, the donor tissue graft is not easy to fix at the recipient site, especially in areas such as the joints, face, cutaneous folds, hands, feet, and hair-bearing areas. Therefore, various methods of donor tissue fixation have been attempted. We report two cases of vitiligo treated with suction blister epidermal grafting, with fibrin tissue adhesion. The first case is that of 16-year-old female patient presented with hypopigmented patches on the forehead and frontal scalp area. The other case is that of 32-year-old female patient presented with hypopigmented patches on the chin. We treated them with phototherapy for 1~4 years; however, the lesions were recalcitrant. Therefore, we tried treatment with a suction blister epidermal graft. Because graft fixation is difficult at the recipient sites, fibrin glue was sprayed on the grafts. Thereafter, we applied a porous silicone wound contact layer over the graft area and applied sterile gauze dressing that was left for a week. One week after the procedure, firm fixation of the donor tissue was observed in both cases. Fibrin glue seemed to improve the graft fixation, providng protection against infection and an optimal environment for wound healing. This report suggests that the application of an epidermal graft with fibrin glufixation, can provide the best result in the surgical treatment of stable vitiligo.
