Propagation of the pressure wave along the arterial tree (pulse wave velocity [PWV]) is related to the intrinsic elasticity of the arterial wall. PWV is increased in stiffer arteries and, when measured over the aorta, is an independent predictor of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Given the predictive power of PWV, identifying strategies that prevent or reduce stiffening may be important in prevention of cardiovascular events. One view is that aortic stiffness occurs as a result of atherosclerosis along the aorta. However, there is little or no association between PWV and classical risk factors for atherosclerosis, other than age and blood pressure. Furthermore, PWV does not increase during early stages of atherosclerosis, as measured by intima-media thickness and non-calcified atheroma, but it does increase in the presence of aortic calcification that occurs within advanced atherosclerotic plaque. Age-related widening of pulse pressure is the major cause of age-related increase in prevalence of hypertension and has been attributed to arterial stiffening. This review summarizes the methods of measuring aortic stiffness in humans, the pathophysiological mechanisms leading to aortic stiffness, including its association with atherosclerosis, and the haemodynamic consequences of increased aortic stiffness.
