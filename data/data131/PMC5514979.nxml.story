The polymerization‐induced self‐assembly (PISA) process is a useful synthetic tool for the efficient synthesis of polymeric nanoparticles of different morphologies. Recently, studies on visible light initiated PISA processes have offered a number of key research opportunities that are not readily accessible using traditional thermally initiated systems. For example, visible light mediated PISA (Photo‐PISA) enables a high degree of control over the dispersion polymerization process by manipulation of the wavelength and intensity of incident light. In some cases, the final nanoparticle morphology of a single formulation can be modulated by simple manipulation of these externally controlled parameters. In addition, temporal (and in principle spatial) control over the Photo‐PISA process can be achieved in most cases. Exploitation of the mild room temperature polymerizations conditions can enable the encapsulation of thermally sensitive therapeutics to occur without compromising the polymerization rate and their activities. Finally, the Photo‐PISA process can enable further mechanistic insights into the morphological evolution of nanoparticle formation such as the effects of temperature on the self‐assembly process. The purpose of this mini‐review is therefore to examine some of these recent advances that have been made in Photo‐PISA processes, particularly in light of the specific advantages that may exist in comparison with conventional thermally initiated systems.
