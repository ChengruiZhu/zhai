 Seven variant strains of influenza A PR8-S virus, each derived from the previous one by serial passage in the lungs of mice immunized with the homologous agent have been produced. With the H.I. and neutralization procedures these variants showed a progressive serological deviation from the parent PR8-S virus. The seven variants provoked antibodies in varying titers to the preceding variants and the parent virus but not in relation to their position in the series. Thus, the seventh variant provoked significantly more antibody to the PR8-S virus than did the fifth variant. A possible explanation for this is presented. The first four variant viruses showed progressively less ability to react with antisera of the preceding variants and the PR8-S virus, and the three most recently derived variants showed essentially no ability to react with PR8-S and first variant antisera. The variant viruses remained antigenically stable through numerous lung passages in normal mice. Cross absorption tests revealed common antigenic components among the variant viruses and also individual characteristics which classify them as being different from one another. The implications of these findings in relation to studies by others have been discussed.
