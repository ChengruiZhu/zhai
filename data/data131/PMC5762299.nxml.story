The combination of radiotherapy and pharmacological inhibition of cellular signal transduction pathways offers promising strategies for enhanced cancer cell inactivation. However, the molecular effects of kinase inhibitors especially on DNA damage detection and repair after X-irradiation have to be understood to facilitate the development of efficient and personalized treatment regimens. Therefore, we applied differential proteomics for analyzing inhibitor-induced changes in either chromatin-bound or phosphorylated nuclear proteins. The effect of the multi kinase inhibitor sorafenib on DNA repair, chromatin binding and phosphorylation of nuclear proteins was analyzed in UT-SCC 42B head and neck cancer cells using metabolic labeling based differential proteomics (SILAC). Sorafenib significantly inhibited DNA repair but failed to significantly affect chromatin interactions of 90 quantified proteins. In contrast, analyzing nuclear phospho-proteins following sorafenib treatment, we detected quantitative changes in 9 out of 59 proteins, including DNA-repair proteins. In conclusion, the analysis of nuclear phospho-proteins by differential proteomics is an effective tool for determining the molecular effects of kinase inhibitors on X-irradiated cells. Analyzing chromatin binding might be less promising.
