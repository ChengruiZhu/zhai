Receptor-stimulated generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) has been shown to regulate signal transduction, and previous studies have suggested that T cell receptor (TCR) signals may involve or be sensitive to ROS. In this study, we have shown for the first time that TCR cross-linking induced rapid (within 15 min) generation of both hydrogen peroxide and superoxide anion, as defined with oxidation-sensitive dyes, selective pharmacologic antioxidants, and overexpression of specific antioxidant enzymes. Furthermore, the data suggest the novel observation that superoxide anion and hydrogen peroxide are produced separately by distinct TCR-stimulated pathways. Unexpectedly, TCR-stimulated activation of the Fas ligand (FasL) promoter and subsequent cell death was dependent upon superoxide anion, but independent of hydrogen peroxide, while nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT) activation or interleukin 2 transcription was independent of all ROS. Anti-CD3 induced phosphorylation of extracellular signalâ€“regulated kinase (ERK)1/2 required hydrogen peroxide generation but was unaffected by superoxide anion. Thus, antigen receptor signaling induces generation of discrete species of oxidants that selectively regulate two distinct redox sensitive pathways, a proapoptotic (FasL) and a proliferative pathway (ERK).
