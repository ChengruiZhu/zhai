It has been discovered that miR-133a-3p acts as a tumor suppressor in bladder cancer (BC). Nevertheless, the function of miR-133a-3p in BC remains unclarified. Thus, we carried out this study to validate the expression of miR-133a-3p in BC and provide insights into the molecular mechanism underlying it. To assess the expression of miR-133a-3p in BC, we searched eligible studies from literature and Gene expression Omnibus (GEO) to perform a meta-analysis. We also plotted the summary receiver operating characteristic (SROC) curve to evaluate the diagnostic ability of miR-133a-3p in BC. Additionally, the potential target genes of miR-133a-3p were acquired from 14 online software programs and GEO database. Protein-protein interaction (PPI) network was created to identify the hub genes. Then, Gene Ontology (GO) functional annotation analysis and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway analysis were carried out to investigate the regulatory network of the target genes. From the meta-analysis, miR-133a-3p was remarkably downregulated in BC tissues compared with that in non-cancer tissues (standard mean difference =−3.84, 95% confidence interval =−6.99–0.29). Moreover, results from SROC suggested that miR-133a-3p exhibited the ability to diagnose BC (area under curve =0.8418). As for the bioinformatics study, 488 genes were chosen as the potential targets of miR-133a-3p in BC, among which 10 genes were defined as hub genes (all degrees >5). Further GO and KEGG pathway analysis indicated that the target genes of miR-133a-3p aggregated in specific biological process and pathways. In conclusion, miR-133a-3p possessed great diagnostic potential with its downregulation in BC, and miR-133a-3p might serve as a novel biomarker for BC.
