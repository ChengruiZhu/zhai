A population of cells that express mast cell markers, including the membrane protein p161, but that lack expression of the high affinity IgE receptor, Fc epsilon RI, can be routinely grown from bone marrow. Ionomycin, but not IgE immune complexes, causes these cells to release serotonin and to express IL-3 and IL-13 mRNA, consistent with their being FC epsilon RI-deficient mast cells. These p161+/Fc epsilon RI- mast cells expressed normal amounts of Fc epsilon RI alpha and beta chain mRNA, but extremely low levels of Fc epsilon RI gamma chain mRNA. In addition, this novel mast cell population expressed CD3 zeta chain mRNA, which p161+/Fc epsilon RI+ mast cells did not. CD3 zeta stable transfectants of Abelson-murine leukemia virus-transformed p161+/Fc epsilon RI+ mast cells continued to express Fc epsilon RI. This strongly suggests that the failure of p161+/Fc epsilon RI- mast cells to express IgE receptors was not caused by the presence of CD3 zeta chain. Transfection of human Fc epsilon RI gamma cDNA into p161+/Fc epsilon RI- mast cells rescued IgE binding. These stable transfectants released serotonin in response to cross-linkage of Fc epsilon RI, demonstrating that the molecular defect of p161+/Fc epsilon RI- mast cells is indeed the loss of Fc epsilon RI gamma expression.
