Mycosis fungoides (MF), the most common type of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma, has various unspecific clinical and histological characteristics. Its early diagnosis is challenging. The application of T-cell receptor (TCR) gene clonal rearrangement to the diagnosis of MF has been widely studied. In this study, we used polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to investigate the diagnostic significance of detecting TCR-γ and -β gene clonal rearrangement in the early diagnosis of mycosis fungoides. PCR for TCR-γ and TCR-β gene rearrangement was performed on 19 patients with suspected early MF, 6 with typical MF, and 6 with chronic dermatitis. Of the 19 patients with suspected early MF, 13 had TCR-γ gene clonal rearrangement, whereas none had TCR-β gene clonal rearrangement. All patients with typical MF had TCR gene clonal rearrangement, in which 4 showed TCR-γ clonal rearrangement, 1 showed TCR-β gene clonal rearrangements, and 1 showed both. No patients with chronic dermatitis had TCR gene clonal rearrangement. These results indicate that TCR gene clonal rearrangement analysis is a useful tool in diagnosing early MF. TCR-γ gene is recommended to the routine analysis, whereas TCR-β gene has potential in combination toward intractable cases.
