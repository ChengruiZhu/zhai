Treat-to-target is a therapeutic concept that considers well defined and specific physiologic targets as aims in controlling the pathophysiology of the disease. It has been widely used in diseases that pathophysiology includes, chronic metabolic and physiological disturbances, namely rheumatic conditions, vascular medicine and diabetes. In diabetes, the availability of “gold-standard” quantitative measures like fasting plasma glucose and glycated hemoglobin make the application of treat-to-target trials especially pertinent. Treatment modalities which have used single therapeutic agents or combinations or in combination with a variety of titration algorithms and implementation protocols have broadened our understanding of diabetes management with specific reference to insulin initiation and maintenance. Treat-to-target trials have been used to investigate a wide variety of questions including efficacy, safety, effect of treatment on comorbidities and patient satisfaction, ideal mechanisms to implement insulin initiation etc. A more generalized acceptance and implementation of treat-to-target trials may finally revolutionize diabetes management by combining aspects of individual care with standard treatment protocols.
