14-3-3 proteins participate in various cellular processes, including apoptosis, proliferation and malignant transformation. 14-3-3σ, a member of the 14-3-3 protein family, is important in several types of cancer; however, little is known about the clinical significance and biological roles of 14-3-3σ in gastric cancer. The present study analyzed the expression pattern of 14-3-3σ in gastric cancer and investigated its correlation with the prognosis of gastric cancer patients. Furthermore, the association of 14-3-3σ with Ki-67, Bcl-2 and Bax was evaluated. 14-3-3σ was expressed at higher level in gastric cancer tissue compared with healthy gastric tissue, and 14-3-3σ expression was significantly correlated with tumor size and tumor node metastasis stage (P<0.05). To the best of our knowledge, the present study data are the first to suggest that 14-3-3σ expression has been significantly associated with poor prognosis in gastric cancer. Additionally, 14-3-3σ overexpression was positively correlated with Ki-67 and Bcl-2 expression levels. Thus, 14-3-3σ is a potential prognostic marker for gastric cancer patients, and may be involved in regulating the apoptosis and proliferation of gastric cancer cells.
