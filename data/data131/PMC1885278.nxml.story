Some molecules responsible for altering the 3-D organization of chromosomes work as complexes of more than ten different proteins, and many are conserved in fungi, plants, and animals. Two such complexes are called “remodels the structure of chromatin” (RSC) in yeast and “switching deficient/sucrose non-fermenting” (SWI/SNF) in man. SWI/SNF is known to inhibit the advent of multiple types of human cancers. Since cancer is a disease whereby cells unduly divide, we sought to define when in the yeast cell division cycle RSC executes essential functions. Using a generic method to induce inactivation of essential proteins in otherwise healthy yeast cells, we found that the RSC complex is important before chromosome replication as well as before chromosome segregation. Interestingly, combining two of the mutations we had generated caused doubling of the entire chromosome complement of yeast. As it is known that such multiplication of the cellular chromosome complements results in an increased malleability of the genetic patrimony, which itself is known to underlie some of the aggressive traits of human cancers, our discovery suggests new models as to why SWI/SNF is such a potent tumor suppressor, and this may in turn provide valuable new inroads for cancer treatment.
