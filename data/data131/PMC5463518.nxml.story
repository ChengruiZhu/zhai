The traditional management of obstructive salivary disorders has been replaced by minimally-invasive gland-preserving techniques including shock-wave lithotripsy, sialendoscopy, interventional radiology and endoscopically video-assisted trans-oral and cervical stone retrieval, of which sialendoscopy is considered to be the method of first choice. Primary endoscopically controlled stone extraction without prior fragmentation is only possible in 15-20% of cases; in more than 80%, fragmentation is necessary because of the size, impactation and location of the stone, or an alternative treatment such as transoral duct surgery or combined approaches are required. Moreover, about 10-20% of all stones cannot be adequately accessed by means of a sialendoscope or any alternative surgical method and, in such cases, extra-corporeal shock wave lithotripsy (ESWL) is the treatment of choice. However, in endoscopically accessible stones, ESWL is being gradually replaced by endoscopically assisted intra-corporeal techniques, including endoscopically guided laser and pneumatic intracorporeal lithotripsy. We describe the currently most widely used techniques for salivary lithotripsy, including ESWL, and endoscopically guided laser, electrohydraulic, electrokinetic and pneumatic intra-corporeal lithotripsy, and discuss their indications given the widespread use of advanced rehabilitative sialendoscopy and combined therapeutic approaches.
