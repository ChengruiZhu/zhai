In biological research, new information is often presented in the form of peer-reviewed published journal articles. Despite the best efforts of electronic database curators, a majority of this information is still found only in textual form, and thus excluded from direct computational analysis. One such type of information that is abundant in scientific literature is protein point mutations. We seek to extract protein point mutation examples from the literature and to associate them with a unique protein name and species of origin in a standardized protein database. To do this, we have created an application that searches for and retrieves full-text articles from publishers, identifies point mutation terms, protein name terms, and organism name terms within the articles. We describe Mutation GraB, an application that utilizes a graph shortest-distance search in concert with word bigram analysis that is used to find significant associations between these terms in the text. This graph bigram search metric was found to be reasonably effective at identifying correct protein point mutation pairs and represents a good compromise between accuracy and broad applicability. The application can be applied to a large set of journal literature from a protein family to generate a database of point mutations.
