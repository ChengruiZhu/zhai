Examining retinal image continuously plays an important role in determining human eye health; with any variation present in this image, it may be resulting from some disease. Therefore, there is a need for computer-aided scanning for retinal image to perform this task automatically and accurately. The fundamental step in this task is identification of the retina elements; optical disk localization is the most important one in this identification. Different optical disc localization algorithms have been suggested, such as an algorithm that would be proposed in this paper. The assumption is based on the fact that optical disc area has rich information, so its entropy value is more significant in this area. The suggested algorithm has recursive steps for testing the entropy of different patches in image; sliding window technique is used to get these patches in a specific way. The results of practical work were obtained using different common data set, which achieved good accuracy in trivial computation time. Finally, this paper consists of four sections: a section for introduction containing the related works, a section for methodology and material, a section for practical work with results, and a section for conclusion.
