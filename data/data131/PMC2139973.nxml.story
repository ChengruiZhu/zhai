Increased microtubule density, for which microtubule stabilization is one potential mechanism, causes contractile dysfunction in cardiac hypertrophy. After microtubule assembly, α-tubulin undergoes two, likely sequential, time-dependent posttranslational changes: reversible carboxy-terminal detyrosination (Tyr-tubulin ↔ Glu-tubulin) and then irreversible deglutamination (Glu-tubulin → Δ2-tubulin), such that Glu- and Δ2-tubulin are markers for long-lived, stable microtubules. Therefore, we generated antibodies for Tyr-, Glu-, and Δ2-tubulin and used them for staining of right and left ventricular cardiocytes from control cats and cats with right ventricular hypertrophy. Tyr- tubulin microtubule staining was equal in right and left ventricular cardiocytes of control cats, but Glu-tubulin and Δ2-tubulin staining were insignificant, i.e., the microtubules were labile. However, Glu- and Δ2-tubulin were conspicuous in microtubules of right ventricular cardiocytes from pressure overloaded cats, i.e., the microtubules were stable. This finding was confirmed in terms of increased microtubule drug and cold stability in the hypertrophied cells. In further studies, we found an increase in a microtubule binding protein, microtubule-associated protein 4, on both mRNA and protein levels in pressure-hypertrophied myocardium. Thus, microtubule stabilization, likely facilitated by binding of a microtubule-associated protein, may be a mechanism for the increased microtubule density characteristic of pressure overload cardiac hypertrophy.
