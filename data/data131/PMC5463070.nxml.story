Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is the most lethal cancer in humans, with a 5‐year survival rate of <5%. Recently, glypican‐1 (GPC1)‐expressing circulating exosomes were found to be a promising diagnostic tool for PDAC. However, the aberrant expression of GPC1 has not been systematically evaluated in large‐scale clinical samples of PDAC. Here, we performed a comprehensive analysis of GPC1 mRNA and protein expression features. Included in this study were 178 PDAC patients from the cancer genome atlas (TCGA) and 186 subjects whose tissues were used in immunohistochemical staining assays. We demonstrated that GPC1 mRNA was silenced in normal pancreata; however, it was re‐expressed in PDAC tissues probably because of the promoter hypomethylation. The GPC1 protein was barely expressed in the normal and adjacent noncancerous pancreata. In tumor tissues, 59.7% (111/186) of the detected samples showed positive expression. Notably, GPC1 was elevated in 63.6% (34/55) of early stage cases. High levels of GPC1 were associated with poorer differentiation and larger tumor diameters. Kaplan–Meier analysis showed a significant difference in overall survival between the groups categorized by GPC1 expression (
