This study was carried out with the participation of 9 (3 female and 6 male) tennis players aged between 12-14 (means 13,22±0,83). Weight, height, body mass index and dominant extremity of the players were recorded. İsokinetic measurement was performed with Isomed 2000® device. İsokinetic testing protocol; before the test all players performed the wrist flexion and extension isokinetic test with the 5 repeating at 90 º/sec as a warm-up and for comprehenting the test. Then, wrist flexion and extension concentric-concentric strength measurements were performed with the 5 repeating at 60 º/sec and with the 15 repeating at 240 º/sec with the angle between 50 degrees of wrist flexion and 60 degrees of wrist extension and peak torque values were recorded. Standard Jamar® Dynamometer was used for grip strength measurements. Grip strenght was performed firstly in sitting position, which is the position of standard measurement. Secondly, in standing position, the elbow was in full ekstansion and the forearm was in neutral position. Thirdly, in standing position the wrist was positioned approximately 30° extension and 10° ulnar deviation. This test was repeated 3 times in all test position and the mean of three scores were recorded. Firstly, the dominant hand, then the non-dominant hand was evoluated. They were allowed to rest for 30 seconds between each grip measurement. Correlation between peak tork of isokinetic muscle strenght and grip strength was done having been used Spearman correlation test.
