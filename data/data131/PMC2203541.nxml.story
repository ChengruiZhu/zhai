 The migration of the screening pigment was investigated in the retina of the intact squid. The action spectrum of pigment migration corresponds to the action spectrum of the visual pigment, rhodopsin, rather than to the absorption spectrum of the screening pigment. The total number of quanta required for a fixed criterion of pigment migration is the same, when the quanta are delivered over any period of time from 6 s to an hour or more. When less than 3–10% of the rhodopsin is isomerized, the screening pigment migrates out to the tips of the receptors with a time-course of 5–15 min, and back again over the same period of time. When rather more than 10% is isomerized, the outward migration takes 5–15 min, but the screening pigment does not migrate inwards, even after several hours in the dark. Indirect evidence suggests that the band of screening pigment, when it reaches the tips of the receptors, is approximately equivalent to a filter of 0.6 log units. The spectral sensitivity of the optic nerve response was measured, and was found to be broader than the absorption spectrum of squid rhodopsin in vitro; the broadness could be explained by self-screening, assuming a density of rhodopsin of 0.6 log units at 500 nm.
