Mucoepidermoid carcinoma of the lung (MEC) is a tumor of low malignant potential of bronchial gland origin. MEC and adenoid cystic carcinoma are both considered to be salivary gland-type neoplasms. MECs are comparatively rare with an incidence of all lung cancers. We recently encountered a case of this type of lung cancer. A 60-year-old man was found to have an abnormal shadow in the left lower lung field on a regular check-up for lung cancer at his company. Chest radiography and CT revealed a mass shadow measuring 30 mm in diameter in the left lower lung field. Bronchoscopy revealed a protuberant tumor in the S9 bronchus, leading to a diagnosis of low-grade MEC by transbronchial lung biopsy. He underwent left lower lobe resection and mediastinal lymph node dissection using VATS. Tumor cells had a scattering of mucus-producing epithelial components in papillary growth of stratified squamous epithelia with anisokaryosis and minimal pleomorphism, indicating a diagnosis of MEC. Because the postoperative course was good and the tumor was low-grade, no adjuvant treatment was administered. The patient has had no signs of tumor recurrence for 9 months, to date, since resection of the tumor
