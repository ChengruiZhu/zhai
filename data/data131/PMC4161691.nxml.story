We report the case of a snack processor who developed occupational rhinoconjunctivitis due to maize brand exposure during the extrusion process, and who experienced abdominal pain upon drinking beer. The allergens implicated and the cross-reactivity between non-specific lipid transfer proteins (LTPs) from different cereals and peach were investigated. Skin prick tests and specific IgE to cereal flours, pulmonary functions tests and specific conjunctival and inhalation challenges to maize extract were performed. In vitro studies included IgE immunoblotting and ELISA inhibition assays. Skin prick tests with maize flour, maize brand and wheat flour extracts were positive, whereas serum specific IgE was positive only to maize flour. Specific inhalation challenge (SIC) to maize flour did not elicit an asthmatic reaction; however, conjunctival challenge test with the same extract was positive. Patient's serum recognized IgE-binding bands in the maize and beer extracts corresponding to LTPs. In the ELISA inhibition assays, a significant degree of allergenic cross-reactivity was found between maize and beer LTPs, whereas no cross-reactivity was observed between maize LTP and wheat and peach LTPs.
