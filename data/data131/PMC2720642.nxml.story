The developing cerebral cortex contains bipolar neural stem cells that span the cortical layers between the inner ventricular surface and the outer pial surface of the embryonic brain. The nuclei of these cells remain near the ventricular cavity, a microenvironment or niche thought to provide vital signals. It is not known how this inner end of the bipolar stem cell is held in place, or what would happen if its attachment to the inner surface were lost. Genetic manipulation can be used to disrupt candidate molecules involved in this adhesion, but this will affect all adhesion points and complicate the results. We have therefore developed an approach to target the stem cell attachments specifically at the ventricular surface by placing blocking antibodies directly into the ventricles of mouse embryos and then expressing fluorescent markers in the stem cells to see the effects of losing this attachment in living tissue. We examined laminins and integrins, whose expression and properties make them excellent candidates. Blocking integrin signalling by antibody application caused the inner end of the stem cells to rapidly detach and then undergo aberrant cell division. We also showed that a transient block of integrins (for <2 hours) resulted in permanent malformations of the cortical layers and disrupted neuronal migration.
