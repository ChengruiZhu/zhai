Sixty-one participants were enrolled over a period of 6 months (49.2 % male, with a mean age 66.8). Forty-seven of the 61 patients had a B-profile. The median NT-proBNP level in the patients with B-profile was 6200, compared with the mean level in the patients with an A-profile of 180 (CI 0.33–0.82). The distributions in the two groups differed significantly (p = 0.034). Based on a threshold level of NT-proBNP in relation to age, the sensitivity and specificity (including the 95 % confidence interval) were determined; the sensitivity of finding B-profile on ultrasound was 92.0 %, and the specificity was 91.0 %. The positive predictive value of the B-profile was 97.0 %, and the negative predictive value was 71.0 %. The systolic function in the subjects with a B-profile was below 50 in 84.3 % of the subjects and normal in 15.7 % of the subjects. An A-profile was present in all of the subjects with systolic function >55 %. In the subjects with a B-profile, 94 % had a Framingham score of CHF >4; the subjects with all A-profile had scores <4, p < 0.0001. There was an NHANES score of >3 in 96 % of the subjects with a B-profile, and all of the subjects with an A-profile had scores <3 (p < 0.0001).
