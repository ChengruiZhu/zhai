Post-operative recurrence in mycetoma is a thoughtful problem. It has numerous undesirable medical, health, socio-economic and psychological impacts on the affected patients and their families, communities and health authorities in endemic regions. It is an important motive for patients to drop out follow up and treatment incompliance and hence the inclination of patients for traditional medical treatment. The factors predicating this phenomenon were not studied previously. However, patientsâ€™ characteristics and clinical presentation can partially offer an explanation. Thus the present study was set out to understand the predictive ability of some clinical factors on predicting the post-operative recurrence of eumycetoma. The present study had showed young farmers with small sized pedal mycetoma, with short disease duration, who are residing in endemic areas, with no family history and who underwent wide local excision are most likely to remain disease free. We can also concluded that, adequate surgical treatment conditions are obligatory to achieve good outcome and to reduce recurrence. Appropriate health education programmes to encourage early presentation to medical care are essential to reduce the postoperative recurrence rate with its detrimental impacts.
