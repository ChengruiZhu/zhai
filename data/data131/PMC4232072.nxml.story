The object of this study was to characterise synovial fluid dendritic cells (SFDCs) with regard to morphology, phenotype and responses to 1,25hydroxy-cholecalciferol (1,25D) and lipopolysaccharide (LPS), and to compare these characteristics with those of peripheral blood (PB) monocyte-derived DCs (MDDCs). SF was aspirated from knees with inflammatory effusions. PB samples were obtained contemporaneously. SFDCs were separated by flow cytometry. Morphology was determined on cytosmears. Expression of accessory molecules, cytokines and prostaglandin synthases mRNA was quantified by reverse transcription PCR. Analyses were performed on freshly prepared DCs and after incubation with 1,25D and LPS, separately and in combination. SFDCs and MDDCs displayed broadly similar morphology. Expression of accessory molecules, cytokines, cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) and prostaglandin E-synthase (PGES) was similar. SFDCs, but not MDDCs, expressed prostaglandin D-synthase (PGDS). PGDS was lost on incubation with SFDCs, but was induced by 1,25D in MDDCs. LPS in the presence or absence of 1,25D, induced interleukin 23 (IL23), IL1β and tumour necrosis factor-α in SFDCs and MDDCs, with SFDC showing stronger expression of these cytokines. 1,25D in combination with LPS induced PGES and enhanced LPS induction of IL6 in SFDCs and MDDCs. LPS reduced 1,25D-induced expression of PGDS in MDDCs. SFDCs and MDDCs display similar basal characteristics but differ in PGDS expression and responsiveness to LPS and 1,25D. MDDCs have limitations as a model of SFDCs which have differentiated
