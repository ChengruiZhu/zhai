A series of 32 consecutive patients (mean age, 69.0 years) with severely degenerated but reparable rotator cuff tears (medium size: 1-3 cm, and large size: 3-5 cm) underwent SCR using fascia lata autografts for reinforcement before ARCR. To determine the indications for SCR for reinforcement, the severity of degeneration in the torn supraspinatus tendon was assessed. We evaluated fatty degeneration in the muscle by using the Goutallier grade; we also scored retraction of the torn tendon (grade 0: no retraction; grade 1: torn edge on the greater tuberosity; grade 2: torn edge on the lateral half of the humeral head; grade 3: torn edge on the medial half of the humeral head; grade 4: torn edge on the glenoid) and tendon quality (grade 0: normal; grade 1: slightly thin, or slight fatty degeneration in the tendon part; grade 2: severely thin, or severe fatty degeneration in the tendon part; grade 3: severely thin, and severe fatty degeneration in the tendon part; grade 4: no tendon). In patients classified with grade 3 or 4 in at least two of these three categories, arthroscopic SCR was performed for reinforcement, after which the torn tendon was repaired over the fascia lata graft. To assess the benefit of SCR for reinforcement, the results from these 32 patients were compared with those after ARCR alone in 91 consecutive patients with medium (1-3 cm) to large (3-5 cm) rotator cuff tears (mean age, 66.7 years). Torn tendons were repaired by using double-row suture-bridges with and without SCR for reinforcement. By using
