Detailed medical history should include information concerning: lower urinary tract symptoms (including nocturia), underlying illnesses, urogenital disorders, previous surgeries and medications administered. Keeping a bladder diary is recommended. The physical examination, depending on the patient's gender, should include gynecological examination with pelvic organ prolapse assessment or prostate evaluation. In laboratory tests, a urinalysis may be used, in particular cases a cytological analysis of urine sediment may be carried out. In addition, a possible ultrasound and/or cystoscopy may be conducted. Nocturia therapy should begin with modifying dietary habits, including compliance with the fluid regimen, avoiding alcohol, coffee and tea. Moderate physical exercise is also recommended. The pharmacological treatment of nocturia caused by nocturnal polyuria is based on the use of desmopressin at a daily single dose of 25 µg for women and 50 µg for men. The use of desmopressin allows for the reduction in the number of nocturia episodes, as well as improves the overall quality of life and sleep. Treatment with desmopressin can also be considered as a form of therapy added in people with an overactive bladder or benign prostatic hyperplasia, in which nocturia is a significant clinical problem.
