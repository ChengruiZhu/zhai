Follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) secreted by adenohypophyseal cells plays an important role in the regulation of reproduction, but whether microRNAs (miRNAs) regulate the secretion of FSH remains unclear. In the present study, we predicted and screened miRNAs that might act on the follicle-stimulating hormone beta-subunit (FSHb) gene of rats using the TargetScan program and luciferase reporter assays, and the results identified two miRNAs, miR-21-3p and miR-433. We then transfected these miRNAs into rat anterior adenohypophyseal cells and assessed the FSHb expression levels in and FSH secretion by the transfected cells through quantitative PCR and ELISA. The results showed that both miR-21-3p and miR-433 down-regulated the expression levels of FSHb and resulted in the decrease of the secretion of FSH compared with the control group, and treatment with miR-21-3p and miR-433 inhibitors up-regulated the expression levels of FSHb and resulted in the increase of the secretion of FSH. Taken together, our results indicate that miR-21-3p and miR-433 can down-regulate the expression of FSHb by directly targeting the FSHb 3â€²UTR in rat primary pituitary cells. Our findings provide evidence that miRNAs can regulate FSHb expression and further affect the secretion of FSH and might contribute to the use of miRNAs for the regulation of animal reproduction.
