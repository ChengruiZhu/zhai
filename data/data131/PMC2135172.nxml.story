 monkeys that intracerebral, intraocular, intracutaneous, intraperitoneal, intraspinal, and neural inoculations of poliomyelitis virus produced no lesions in the olfactory bulbs despite the fact that the animals contracted pronounced paralyses. This indicated that the virus could be restricted to certain neuronal systems. 2. Similarly intranasal inoculation of seven animals produced no lesions in the ciliary ganglia. 3. Two monkeys convalescent from an intracutaneous and an intracerebral inoculation respectively had further paralyses after intranasal inoculation of heterologous virus. A third animal convalescent from an intranasal inoculation showed extension of lesions after intranasal and intraocular inoculation with heterologous virus. 4. Two spinal animals in which an attack of poliomyelitis was limited to an isolated segment of spinal cord, contracted typical paralyses in the previously uninvaded portions of the CNS following intranasal inoculation of homologous virus. 5. Four of six convalescent monkeys showed extension of lesions but no clinical signs after homologous virus inoculation through a previously un-invaded portal. 6. Four animals convalescent from a unilateral intranasal inoculation showed evidence of new invasion in the opposite olfactory bulb but no extension of paralyses following a second inoculation of homologous virus into the appropriate nostril. 7. Two animals had second attacks after heterologous second inoculations. The intranasal portal was employed for both exposures. 8. It thus seems apparent that in the
