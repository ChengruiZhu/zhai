The subcellular distribution of NADH-cytochrome b5 reductase in rat liver cells was reinvestigated. In fresh heavy and light Golgi fractions (GF3 and GF1 + 2) and in mitochondria, the specific activity of rotenone-insensitive NADH-cytochrome c reductase was approximately 100, 60, and 30%, respectively, of the value found in microsomes. However, the Golgi enzyme was unstable inasmuch as pelleting and resuspending the fresh fractions resulted in a considerable inactivation (40--60%), which was further increased with subsequent storage at 4 degrees C. A similar inactivation was observed using cytochrome b5 but not ferricyanide as electron acceptor. The inactivation of Golgi NADH-cytochrome c reductase activity was independent of the protein concentration of the fractions during storage, was unaffected by the addition of the antioxidant butylated hydroxytoluene, but was partly prevented by buffering the fractions at neutral pH and by storage at--20 degrees C. A total Golgi fraction was analyzed by density equilibration on continuous sucrose gradients after exposure to digitonin. As expected, the distribution of both protein and galactosyl transferase were shifted to higher densities by this treatment. However, not all galactosyl transferase-bearing elements were shifted to the same extent by exposure to the detergent, suggesting a biochemical heterogeneity of the Golgi complex. In contrast to their behavior in microsomes, the distribution of NADH- cytochrome c reductase and cytochrome b5 of Golgi fractions was shifted by digitonin, although to a lesser extent than that of galactosyl transferase. These results indicate that NADH-cytochrome b5 reductase is an authentic component of Golgi membranes, as well as of microsomes and of mitochondria. The conflicting results reported in the past on the Golgi localization of the enzyme could be due, on the one hand, to the differential lability of the activity in its various subcellular locations and, on the other, to the heterogeneity of the Golgi complex in terms of both cholesterol and enzyme distribution.
