CD4+ T cells orchestrate adaptive immune responses in vertebrates. These cells differentiate into several types depending on environmental signals and immunological challenges. Once these cells are committed to a particular fate, they can switch to different cell types, thus exhibiting plasticity that enables the immune system to dynamically adapt to novel challenges. We integrated available experimental data into a large network that was formally reduced to a minimal regulatory module with a sufficient set of components and interactions to recover most CD4+ T cell types and reported plasticity patterns in response to various micro-environments and transient perturbations. We formally demonstrate that transcriptional regulatory interactions are not sufficient to recover CD4+ T cell types and thus propose a minimal network that induces most observed phenotypes. This model is robust and was validated with mutant CD4+ T phenotypes. The model was also used to identify key components for cell differentiation and plasticity under varying immunogenic conditions. The model presented here may be a useful framework to study other plastic systems and guide therapeutic approaches to immune system modulation.
