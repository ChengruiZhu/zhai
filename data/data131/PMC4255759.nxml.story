The regulatory functions of proline metabolism proposed 3 decades ago have found relevance in many areas. For cancer, these functions play a role in apoptosis, autophagy and in response to nutrient and oxygen deprivation. Importantly, proline-derived reactive oxygen species served as a driving signal for reprogramming. This model has been applied by others to metabolic regulation for the insulin-prosurvival axis, induction of adipose triglyceride lipase for lipid metabolism and regulation of embryonic stem cell development. Of special interest, modulatory proteins such as parkinson protein 7 and oral cancer overexpressed 1 interact with pyrroline-5-carboxylate reductase, a critical component of the proline regulatory axis. Although the interconvertibility of proline and glutamine has been long established, recent findings showed that the proto-oncogene, cellular myelocytomatosis oncogene, upregulates glutamine utilization (glutaminase) and routes glutamate to proline biosynthesis (pyrroline-5-carboxylate synthase, pyrroline-5-carboxylate reductases). Additionally, collagen, which contains large amounts of proline, may be metabolized to serve as a reservoir for proline. This metabolic relationship as well as the new regulatory targets of proline metabolism invites an elucidation of the differential effects of these nonessential amino acids and their production, storage and mobilization.
