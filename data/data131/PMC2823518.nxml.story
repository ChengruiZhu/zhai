Apoptotic cells are opsonized by complement components such as C1q and C3b, which increases their susceptibility to phagocytosis. Soluble complement inhibitors such as factor H (fH) also recognize apoptotic cells to minimize the pro-inflammatory effects of downstream complement activation. We used four radiolabeled protein constructs that span different regions of the 20 complement control protein (CCP) modules that make up fH and found that fragments comprising CCPs 6–8, CCPs 8–15, and CCPs 19–20 but not CCPs 1–4, bound to apoptotic Jurkat T cells. There are four possible ligand types on apoptotic cells that could recruit fH: proteins, carbohydrates, lipids, and DNA. We found that CCPs 6–8 of fH bind to annexin-II, a trypsin-insensitive protein that becomes exposed on surfaces of apoptotic cells. The second ligand of fH, which interacts with CCPs 6–8 and 19–20, is DNA. Confocal microscopy showed co-localization of fH with antibodies specific for DNA. fH also binds to histones devoid of DNA, and CCPs 1–4, 6–8, and 8–15 mediate this interaction. Treatment of apoptotic cells with neuraminidase, chondroitinase, heparitinase, and heparinase did not change fH binding. Treatment of apoptotic cells with phospholipase A
