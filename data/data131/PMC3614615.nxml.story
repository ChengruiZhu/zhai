The purpose of this study is to evaluate the success rate and safety of argon laser photocoagulation as a modality of treatment for symptomatic trichiasis in a Middle Eastern country (Jordan). This simple descriptive study included 54 patients (68 lids) with symptomatic trichiasis. They were treated with argon laser and followed over 8 month period. After topical and infiltration anaesthesia, 30-40 shots of blue-argon laser were directed to the lash root to a depth of 2-3mm. Laser beam variables were: 50-100 Î¼m spot size, 0.3 second duration and 0.50 Watt power. The maximum number of treated lashes per lid was five. Recurrence was defined as regrowth of one or more trichiatic lash. Up to two additional applications with the same laser parameters were done for recurrent trichiasis. The success rate after one treatment session was 61.1% and with up to a total of three sessions, it was 85.2%. The complication rate was 20.6% (14 lids) in the form of mild hypopigmentation in 8 lids and notching in 6 lids. The complication rate was higher among patients treated previously with cryotheray or lid surgery. Argon laser photocoagulation is a safe and effective office procedure for treatment of symptomatic trichiasis.
