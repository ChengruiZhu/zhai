We report the development of a new system for interactive patient posture, position, and respiratory control during radiation therapy treatment. The system consists of an infrared (IR) camera, retroreflective markers, and dedicated software that makes it practical to use in the clinic. The system is designed to be used with multiple retroreflective markers to monitor not only the position, but also the posture of the patient in real time. Specific features of the system include the following: (1) The system reports an absolute misalignment at several points on a patient and also provides feedback on any necessary adjustments in terms of site‐specific setup parameters, such as focus‐to‐surface distance (PIN), superior and inferior alignment, and chest‐wall angle. (2) The system is based on a set of predefined templates containing the number and position of control points and feedback parameters developed for different treatment sites. (3) A noninvasive IR‐based “virtual portal vision” procedure projects organ contours in the beam's‐eye‐view (BEV) based on the IR marker locations obtained in real time and compares them with digitally reconstructed radiographs (DRRs) from CT simulation. Assuming good correlation between external markers and internal anatomy, the system offers the possibility of mimicking a verification procedure without taking port‐films, which can potentially reduce the setup time. In this paper, we concentrate on the system properties and performance while initial applications on a number of clinical sites are ongoing. Accuracy and precision of this system are evaluated in the context of breast/chest treatments using rigid phantoms. The system has an intrinsic uncertainty of
