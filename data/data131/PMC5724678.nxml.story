Sodium salicylate (NaSal) is a nonsteroidal anti‐inflammatory drug. The putative mechanisms for NaSal's pharmacologic actions include the inhibition of cyclooxygenases, platelet‐derived thromboxane A2, and NF‐κB signaling. Recent studies demonstrated that salicylate could activate AMP‐activated protein kinase (AMPK), an energy sensor that maintains the balance between ATP production and consumption. The anti‐inflammatory action of AMPK has been reported to be mediated by promoting mitochondrial biogenesis and fatty acid oxidation. However, the exact signals responsible for salicylate‐mediated inflammation through AMPK are not well‐understood. In the current study, we examined the potential effects of NaSal on inflammation‐like responses of THP‐1 monocytes to lipopolysaccharide (LPS) challenge. THP‐1 cells were stimulated with or without 10 ug/mL LPS for 24 h in the presence or absence of 5 mM NaSal. Apoptosis was measured by flow cytometry using Annexin V/PI staining and by Western blotting for the Bcl‐2 anti‐apoptotic protein. Cell proliferation was detected by EdU incorporation and by Western blot analysis for proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA). Secretion of pro‐inflammatory cytokines (TNF‐α, IL‐1β, IL‐6) was determined by enzyme‐linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). We observed that the activation of AMPK by NaSal was accompanied by induction of apoptosis, inhibition of cell proliferation, and increasing secretion of TNF‐α and IL‐1β. These effects were reversed by Compound C, an inhibitor of AMPK. In addition, NaSal/AMPK activation inhibited LPS‐induced STAT3 phosphorylation, which was reversed by Compound C treatment. We conclude that AMPK activation is important for NaSal‐mediated inflammation by inducing apoptosis, reducing cell proliferation, inhibiting STAT3 activity, and producing TNF‐α and IL‐1β.
