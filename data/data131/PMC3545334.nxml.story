Acute dissection of the thoracic aorta (AAD) is a potentially catastrophic disease, with significant morbidity and mortality, which remain unchanged over the last decade. Survival rate has been shown to be directly related to prompt diagnosis and precise management; however diagnosis of the disease remains time-consuming, not readily available, and lacking in sensitivity and specificity. The current approach when diagnosing AAD relies heavily on various imaging techniques, including chest radiograph, echocardiography, computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging scans. Nevertheless, the door remains open for the incorporation of biochemical tests to aid in detecting AAD. This article will review the imaging modalities currently employed in the management of AAD, as well as a discussion of the potential role of several biomarkers in AAD. To date, imaging is the diagnostic tool for AAD however, technical and logistical limitations limit the use of imaging in various circumstances. Current available biomarkers such as D-dimer and C-reactive protein are under-utilized in many cases, mainly due to their non-specificity in diagnosing AAD. Over the last decade, many biomarkers have been proposed for use in AAD, with several showing promising results â€“ including: smooth muscle myosin heavy chain, calponin, soluble elastin fragments and transforming growth factor
