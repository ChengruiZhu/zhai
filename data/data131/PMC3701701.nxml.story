 meiosis. During meiosis, one round of DNA replication is followed by two rounds of nuclear division (called meiosis I and II). This is unlike mitotically proliferating cells wherein one round of DNA replication is followed by one round of nuclear division. During meiosis I, sister chromatids move towards the same spindle pole unlike in mitosis where they move towards opposite spindle poles. Poleward chromosome movement is achieved by association of kinetochores (a complex network of proteins assembled at centromeres on chromosomes) with microtubule ends emanating from spindle poles. The basis of the contrasting fate of sister chromatids during mitosis and meiosis I is best studied in budding yeast in which a protein complex called monopolin binds to sister kinetochores during meiosis I and ensures that they face the same spindle pole. But precisely how monopolin binds to kinetochores was unknown. In this study, we have identified a monopolin's receptor at the kinetochore. Disabling the receptor did not affect mitotic growth but severely compromised meiotic chromosome segregation. Cells lacking the monopolin receptor attempt to segregate sister chromatids towards opposite spindle poles during meiosis I with catastrophic genetic consequences.
