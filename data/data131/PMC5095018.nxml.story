Glioblastoma is a common type of brain aggressive tumors and has a poor prognosis. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a class of small, endogenous and non-coding RNAs that play crucial roles in cell proliferation, survival and invasion. Deregulated expression of miR-300 has been studied in a lot of cancers. However, the role of miR-300 in glioblastoma is still unknown. In this study, we demonstrated that miR-300 expression was downregulated in glioblastoma tissues compared with the normal tissues. Lower expression level of miR-300 was observed in thirty cases (75 %, 30/40) of glioblastoma samples compared with the normal samples. Moreover, the overall survival of glioblastoma patients with lower miR-300 expression level was shorter than those with higher miR-300 expression level. In addition, miR-300 expression was also downregulated in glioblastoma cell lines. Overexpression of miR-300 inhibited cell proliferation, cell cycle and invasion in glioblastoma cell line U87 and U251. Moreover, we identified ROCK1 as a direct target of miR-300 in U87 and U251 cells. Overexpression of ROCK1 partially rescued the miR-300-mediated cell growth. ROCK1 expression levels in glioblastoma tissues were higher than that in normal tissues. ROCK1 expression levels were higher in thirty-one cases of glioblastoma samples than their normal samples. Furthermore, the expression level ROCK1 was inversely correlated with the expression level of miR-300. Importantly, overexpression of miR-300 suppressed glioblastoma progression in an established xenograft model. In conclusion, we revealed that miR-300 might act as a tumor suppressor gene through inhibiting ROCK1 in glioblastoma.
