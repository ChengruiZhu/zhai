Percutaneous cardioscopy, using high-resolution fiberoptic imaging, enables direct visualization of the cardiac interior, thereby enabling macroscopic pathological diagnosis. Percutaneous cardioscopy has demonstrated that the endocardial surface exhibits various colors characteristic of different heart diseases. This imaging modality can now be used for evaluation of the severity of myocardial ischemia, and staging of myocarditis. Myocardial blood flow recovery induced by vasodilating agents or percutaneous coronary interventions can be clearly visualized. Morphological and functional changes in the cardiac valves can also be evaluated. Cardioscope-guided endomyocardial biopsy enables pin-point biopsy of the diseased myocardium. Recently, dye-image cardioscopy and fluorescence cardioscopy were developed for evaluation of the subendocardial microcirculation. Cardioscope-guided intracardiac therapies such as myotomy, myectomy, valvulotomy, and transendocardial angiogenic and myogenic therapy have been trialed using animal models in anticipation of future clinical applications. Percutaneous cardioscopy has the potential to contribute to our understanding of heart disease, and to assist in guidance for intracardiac therapies.
