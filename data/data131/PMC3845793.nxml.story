A standardized Adverse Drug Events (ADEs) knowledge base that encodes known ADE knowledge can be very useful in improving ADE detection for drug safety surveillance. In our previous study, we developed the ADEpedia that is a standardized knowledge base of ADEs based on drug product labels. The objectives of the present study are 1) to integrate normalized ADE knowledge from the Unified Medical Language System (UMLS) into the ADEpedia; and 2) to enrich the knowledge base with the drug-disorder co-occurrence data from a 51-million-document electronic medical records (EMRs) system. We extracted 266,832 drug-disorder concept pairs from the UMLS, covering 14,256 (1.69%) distinct drug concepts and 19,006 (3.53%) distinct disorder concepts. Of them, 71,626 (26.8%) concept pairs from UMLS co-occurred in the EMRs. We performed a preliminary evaluation on the utility of the UMLS ADE data. In conclusion, we have built an ADEpedia 2.0 framework that intends to integrate known ADE knowledge from disparate sources. The UMLS is a useful source for providing standardized ADE knowledge relevant to indications, contraindications and adverse effects, and complementary to the ADE data from drug product labels. The statistics from EMRs would enable the meaningful use of ADE data for drug safety surveillance.
