 are also capable of forming invasive pseudohyphal filaments in nutrient poor conditions, which has served as a model system for the study of filamentous fungal pathogens. Here, we show that the most commonly used laboratory strain, S288c, previously known as being non-filamentous, can adopt a permanent stable pseudohyphal growth phase even under rich growth conditions. Although some features are shared, the degree of filamentation, genetic requirements, cell cycle, and mechanism of regulation are distinct from the previously described forms of filamentous growth. Stable pseudohyphal growth arises as a result of only two mutations, neither of which causes pseudohyphal growth on their own. One mutation causes subtle defects in the mechanism of cell separation (septation), which activate intracellular signaling pathways that slow cell division and promote filamentation. Normally this pathway is kept in check by a related signaling protein. However, when the inhibitor is also defective, activation of the filamentation signaling pathway exacerbates the septation defects, which causes a synergistic hyper-activation of pseudohyphal growth. These findings expand our understanding of fungal pathogenesis mechanisms at the molecular level.
