 for 6 h/day, 5 days/week) or filtered air (FA) throughout gestation. Treatment effects on litter size and gender distribution were recorded. Plasma cholesterol and triglycerides were measured at 8, 12 and 16 weeks of age. Urinary 8-isoprostane and liver 8-hydroxy-deoxyguanosine levels were measured at killing at 16 weeks of age. Expression of the antioxidant genes heme oxygenase-1 and the glutamate-cysteine ligase modifier and catalytic subunits were measured in the lung, liver and aorta. The average area and frequency of atherosclerotic lesions were measured in the aortic sinus and innominate arteries. There were significantly smaller litters and higher postnatal mortality in the DE-exposed mice. There were no significant differences in plasma lipids or lipoprotein profiles, expression of antioxidant genes or markers of oxidative stress between treatment groups. There were also no significant differences in average atherosclerotic lesion area in the aortic sinus or innominate arteries of the DE and FA groups although there was a higher frequency of lesions in the DE-exposed group. Our study indicates that in utero DE exposure does not influence later life lipoprotein metabolism, redox homeostasis or the risk of developing larger atherosclerotic lesions.
