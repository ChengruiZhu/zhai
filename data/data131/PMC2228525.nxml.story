The gustatory receptors of the eel palate were found to be extremely sensitive to amino acids and carboxylic acids. The results obtained are as follows: (a) 11 amino acids which are among naturally occurring amino acids elicited responses in the palatine nerve, but 9 amino acids did not elicit a response even at a high concentration. The effect of D- amino acids was always much less than that of their corresponding L- isomers. There was no appreciable difference in the effectiveness of an alpha-amino acid (alpha-alanine) and beta-amino acid (beta-alanine). (b) The threshold concentrations of the most potent amino acids (arginine, glycine) were between 10(-8) and 10(-9) M. A linear relation between the magnitude of the response and log stimulus concentration held for a wide concentration range for all the amino acids examined. (c) The palatine receptors responded sensitively to various carboxylic acid solutions whose pH was adjusted to neutral. The threshold concentrations varied between 10(-4) and 10(-7) M. The magnitude of the response at 10(-2) M increased with an increase of carbon chain length. (d) The extent of cross-adaptation was examined with various combinations of amino acids. A variety of the response patterns showing complete cross-adaptation, no cross-adaptation, or synergetic interaction was observed. The synergetic interaction was also observed when one amino acid below its threshold concentration was added to the other amino acid below its threshold concentration was added to the other amino acid. No cross-adaptation was observed between amino acids and fatty acids. (e) The treatment of the palate with papain led to loss of the responses to arginine, glycine, and histidine without affecting those to proline and acetic acid. The treatment with pronase E eliminated selectively the response to proline. The possibility that the eel gustatory receptors are responsible for sensing food at a distance was discussed.
