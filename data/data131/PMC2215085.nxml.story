The ionophore X537A causes a large increase in the [(14)C]dopamine (a catecholamine) permeability of planar bilayer membranes. Dopamine transport increases linearly with the ionophore concentration. At relatively high concentrations in the presence of dopamine, the ionophore omdices a conductance which is nearly ideally selective for the dopamine cation. However, the total dopamine flux as determined in tracer experiments is not affected by an electric field and is over 10(5) times larger than predicted from the estimated dopamine conductance. Increasing the dopamine concentration on the side containing radioactive dopamine (the cis side) saturates the dopamine transport. This saturation is relieved by trans addition of nonradioactive dopamine, tyramine, H(+), or K(+). With unequal concentrations of dopamine cis and trans (49 and 12.5 mM), the unidirectional dopamine fluxes are equal. Increasing H(+) cis and trans decreases dopamine transport. It is concluded that at physiological pH, the X537A-induced transport of dopamine occurs via an electrically silent exchange diffusion of dopamine cation with another cation (e.g., dopamine(+), H(+), or K(+)). X537A induces a Ca(++)-independent release of catecholamines from sympathetic nerves by interfering with intracellular storage within storage vesicles (R.W. Holz. 1975. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 375:138-152). It is suggested that X537A causes an exchange of intravesicular catecholamine with a cytoplasmic cation (perhaps K(+) or H(+)) across the storage vesicle membrane.
