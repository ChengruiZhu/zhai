Oxidized low density lipoprotein (oxLDL) induces macrophage activation, an event essential for atherosclerosis. Emerging evidence supports that epigenetic regulation plays important roles in macrophage activation and function. However, it remains unclear which epigenetic modulator is responsible for oxLDL-induced macrophage activation. Here, we identify for the first time KDM4A (JMJD2A) as an epigenetic modifying enzyme that controls oxLDL-induced pro-inflammatory M1 polarization of macrophages. OxLDL triggered M1 polarization of murine and human macrophages, characterized by expression of iNOS and robust production of inflammatory cytokines (e.g., TNF-α, MCP-1, IL-1β). In contrast, protein level of the M2 marker Arg1 was clearly decreased after treated with oxLDL. Notably, exposure to oxLDL resulted in markedly increased expression of KDM4A in macrophages. Functionally, shRNA knockdown of KDM4A significantly impaired M1 polarization and expression of inflammatory cytokines induced by oxLDL, accompanied by increased expression of Arg1 and VEGF. However, inhibition of KDM4A by shRNA or the pan-selective KDM inhibitor JIB-04 did not affect oxLDL-mediated activation of the NF-κB and hypoxia inducible factor (HIF) pathways, and vice versa. In addition, JIB-04 induced apoptosis of macrophages in a dose-dependent manner, an event attenuated by oxLDL. Together, these findings argue that KDM4A might represent a novel epigenetic modulator that acts to direct oxLDL-induced M1 polarization of macrophages, while its up-regulation is independent of NF-κB and HIF activation, two signals critical for pro-inflammatory activation of macrophages. They also suggest that KDM4A might serve as a potential target for epigenetic therapy in prevention and treatment of inflammatory diseases such as atherosclerosis.
