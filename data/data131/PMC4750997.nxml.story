The manner in which the nervous system coordinates the multiple muscles in the body is complex. It has been studied for decades, but a more full understanding is needed to enable the development of effective evaluation and treatment methods in disorders that cause neuromuscular disability such as cerebral palsy and stroke. In addition, the computational control of robots has and will continue to improve as the brainâ€™s methods of muscular control are progressively reverse-engineered. Here, we study the capacity of arm muscles to regulate the stiffness of the hand for tasks such as using tools, stabilizing hand-held objects, and using doors. Using a simplified but generalizable model, we show that there will be necessary trade-offs in the functional capabilities of the limb if the nervous system chooses to control muscles in functional groups. This adds to our understanding of the consequences of different strategies to control muscles for real-world tasks with multiple and often competing demands. It enables future research and clinical experiments on the learning and execution of the multiple tasks of varying difficulty encountered in real life. It also sheds light on the design of control strategies for robots to operate in human and unstructured environments.
