Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients with epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutations are responsive to EGFR-tyrosine kinase inhibitor (EGFR-TKI). However, NSCLC patients with secondary somatic EGFR mutations are resistant to EGFR-TKI treatment. In this study, we investigated the effect of TG101348 (a JAK2 inhibitor) on the tumor growth of erlotinib-resistant NSCLC cells. Cell proliferation, apoptosis, gene expression and tumor growth were evaluated by diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay, flow cytometry, terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase biotin-dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) staining, Western Blot and a xenograft mouse model, respectively. Results showed that erlotinib had a stronger impact on the induction of apoptosis in erlotinib-sensitive PC-9 cells but had a weaker effect on erlotinib-resistant H1975 and H1650 cells than TG101348. TG101348 significantly enhanced the cytotoxicity of erlotinib to erlotinib-resistant NSCLC cells, stimulated erlotinib-induced apoptosis and downregulated the expressions of EGFR, p-EGFR, p-STAT3, Bcl-xL and survivin in erlotinib-resistant NSCLC cells. Moreover, the combined treatment of TG101348 and erlotinib induced apoptosis, inhibited the activation of p-EGFR and p-STAT3, and inhibited tumor growth of erlotinib-resistant NSCLC cells
