The mammalian cochlea encodes sound pressure levels over six orders of magnitude. This wide dynamic range is achieved by amplifying weak sounds. The outer hair cells, one of two types of receptor cells in the cochlea, are known as the cellular actuators that provide power for the amplification. It is well known that high frequency sounds encoded in the basal turn of the cochlea are amplified more than low frequency sounds encoded in the apical turn of the cochlea. This difference in amplification has been ascribed to a difference in electrophysiological properties, such as the membrane capacitance and conductance of the outer hair cells at different locations. Whether the outer hair cells have a sufficient range of electrophysiological properties to explain the location dependent amplification has long been a topic of scientific debate. In this study, we present an alternative explanation for how the low and high frequency sounds are amplified differently. Using a detailed computational model of the cochlear epithelium (the organ of Corti), we demonstrate that the micro-mechanics of the organ of Corti can explain the variation of amplification with longitudinal location in the cochlea.
