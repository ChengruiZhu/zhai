Background: Hospital based data on mortality pattern is a reflection of what is obtainable in a community at large. Therefore, data obtained from such review is usually beneficial in re-evaluating existing services and in improving facilities and patient care. The aim of this study was to evaluate the mortality pattern of children admitted into the children medical wards of the University of Port-Harcourt Teaching Hospital from Jan 2007 to December 2008. Materials and Methods: This was a retrospective study. The case files of all patients aged one month to 16 years, admitted into the paediatric wards of University of Port-Harcourt Teaching Hospital, Port-Harcourt, Nigeria over a 2 year period were reviewed. Neonatal and surgical cases were excluded. Results: There were 2,174 admissions during the study period. Sixty one of the total number of admissions died in the children medical wards giving a mortality rate of 2.8%. The youngest child was 2 months and the oldest 10 years. Fifty two (80.3%) were under 5 years. There was male preponderance. Most of the deaths occurred between April and September. The commonest causes of death were HIV/AIDS and bronchopneumonia in the under five age group; while in those above 5 years of age malignancies and HIV/AIDS were the predominant causes. Conclusion: Effective HIV/AIDS control measures will significantly reduce child mortality in our community. Also there is need to have a closer look at the potential risk for malignancies. Health intervention programmes such as integrated management of childhood illnesses and primary health care, which have been shown to reduce childhood deaths significantly, need to be intensified in order to achieve the MDG 4 by 2015.
