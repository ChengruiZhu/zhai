 NK cells. SET was up-regulated upon monokine stimulation of primary human NK cells. Furthermore, ectopic overexpression of SET significantly enhanced IFN-γ gene expression in monokine-stimulated NK cells. In contrast, RNAi-mediated suppression of SET expression renders NK cells inefficient in producing high levels of IFN-γ in response to monokine costimulation. Mechanistically, suppression of PP2A activity by SET is important for IFN-γ gene expression in NK cells. In fact, treatment of primary human NK cells with the PP2A activator 1,9-dideoxy-forskolin, as well as administration of the drug to C57BL/6 mice, significantly reduced NK-dependent IFN-γ production in response to monokine treatment. Further, SET knockdown or pharmacologic activation of PP2A diminished extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2, p65RelA, signal transducer and activator of transduction 4 (STAT4), and STAT5 activity in monokine-stimulated NK cells, potentially contributing to the reduction in IFN-γ gene expression. Thus, SET expression is essential for suppressing PP2A phosphatase activity that would otherwise limit NK cell antitumoral and/or antiinflammatory functions by impairing NK cell production of IFN-γ.
