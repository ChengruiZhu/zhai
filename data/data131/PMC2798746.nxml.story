Our visual perception of the world is remarkably stable despite the fact that we move our gaze and body. This must be the effect of the neuronal organization of the visual areas of our brains that succeed in maintaining in our consciouness a representation that seems to be protected from brutal variations. We propose a theory to account for an invariance that pertains to such image features as edges and textures. It is based on the simple assumption that the spatial variations of the image intensity, its derivatives, are extracted and represented in some visual brain areas by populations of neurons that excite and inhibit each other according to the values of these derivatives. Geometric transformations of the retinal image, caused say by eye movements, affect these derivatives. Assuming that their representations are invariant to these transformations, we predict the appearance of specific patterns of activity which we call hyperbolic planforms. It is surprising that the geometry that emerges from our investigations is not the usual Euclidean geometry but the much less familiar hyperbolic, non-Euclidean, geometry. We also propose some preliminary ideas for putting our theory to the test by actual measurements of brain activity.
