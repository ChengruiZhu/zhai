 week) and daily high-fat diet were used to establish T2DM rat model. Serum glucose in diabetes group and diabetes + VEGF group obviously exceeded 13mmol/L after STZ injection. Immunohistochemical studies indicated that VEGF level in diabetes group significantly decreased. In diabetes group, testicular blood velocity and vascular area reduced evaluated by Doppler and FITC. Furthermore, atrophic testicular morphology and increasing apoptosis cells were evaluated by haematoxylin and eosin staining and TUNEL assay. In diabetes + VEGF group, the administration of VEGF (intraperitoneally, 10mg/kg) can significantly alleviated hyperglycemia-induced impairment of testes in above aspects. Finally, we used Western blot to analyze the mechanism of hyperglycemia-induced testicular VEGF decrease. The results indicated that hyperglycemia-induced VEGF decreased is regulated by PI3K/Akt pathway in Rats testicular sertoli cells (RTSCs). Together, we demonstrate that T2DM can reduce testicular VEGF expression, which results in testicular microcirculation impairment, and then induces testicular morphological disarrangement and functional disorder. These actions are triggered by PI3K/Akt pathway. Our findings provide solid evidence for VEGF becoming a therapeutic target in T2DM related male infertility.
