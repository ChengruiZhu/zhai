Four adult patients with recently diagnosed common variable immunodeficiency qualified for standard subcutaneous immunoglobulin replacement therapy regimen. They had no history of receiving immunoglobulins, blood or blood product transfusions. Edema, confluent wheals and erythema were observed at the site of subcutaneous immunoglobulin infusion: typical early and late phase reaction. A transient increase in various passively transferred IgG and IgE antibodies was responsible for misleading positive outcome of the serological testing for active humoral response such as type I allergy, anti-Rh, isohemagglutinins and rheumatoid factor (RF). Although the clinical presentation was very unusual and severe, the retrospective analysis showed no isohemagglutinins, RF and IgE in the patients’ serum before but it was positive after the infusion (median IgE = 18 IU/ml, RF = 8 IU/ml). Type I allergic reaction (laryngeal edema, rhinoconjuctivitis) came out at +14 days of replacement therapy when the patient visited countryside. In the second patient anaphylactic reaction was observed 5 days after ScIg administration, and only when the patient consumed peanuts. Therefore, IgE concentration was measured retrospectively in a series of commercial preparations used in the initial subcutaneous immunoglobulin replacement therapy that caused the adverse event (AE) and it was determined between 138 and 232 IU/ml (kU/l), i.e. 690–2100 IU per g of protein. Specific IgE was within a wide range from 198 (mix of food) to 2809 kUA/l (mix of grass) but many of the tested allergen-specific IgE were class 2 or 3 (i.e. 0.71–17.5 kUA/l).
