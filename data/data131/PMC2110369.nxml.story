Frog exocrine pancreatic tissue was studied in vitro under conditions which maintain the differences between tissues from fasted and fed animals. Sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) gel electrophoresis after labeling with [14C]amino acids showed that feeding stimulated the synthesis of secretory proteins to the same relative degree as the overall protein synthesis. The intracellular transport of secretory proteins was studied by electronmicroscopy autoradiography after pulse- labeling with [3H]leucine. It was found that the transport route is similar under both feeding conditions. After their synthesis in the rough endoplasmic reticulum (RER), the proteins move through the peripheral elements and cisternae of the Golgi system into the condensing vacuoles. The velocity of the transport increases considerably after feeding. When frogs are fasted, the release of labeled proteins from the RER takes greater than 90 min, whereas after feeding, this happens within 30 min. Comparable differences were observed for transport through the Golgi system. The apparent differences between the frog and mammalian pancreas in the regulation of synthesis, intracellular transport, and secretion of proteins are discussed.
