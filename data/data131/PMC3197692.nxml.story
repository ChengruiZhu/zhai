Much of what we know about the genetic basis of immunity to infection has come from studies of laboratory animals. However, these animals are kept in conditions very different from those experienced in the natural environment. In order to improve our understanding of the genetic determinants of disease susceptibility, it is therefore important to examine how genetic variation impacts on immunity in natural populations. So far, studies into the genetic basis of pathogen resistance in the wild have focussed almost exclusively on genes of the Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC). The MHC is undoubtedly important in immunity to infection, but there are many other genes involved in the immune response that are yet to be investigated. Here we examine genetic variation in cytokines, signalling molecules crucial in the induction and regulation of the different effector arms of the immune response. We use a natural population of field voles, wild rodents related to common laboratory species, and show that variation within cytokine genes is linked to differences between individuals in their immune response and in resistance to multiple pathogens. Cytokines are then likely to be an important source of genetic variation to help individuals combat infection and survive in the wild.
