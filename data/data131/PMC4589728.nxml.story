Seventy-five extracted single canaled teeth of roots ranging 10-12 mm in length were used for the study. Teeth were divided into 4 study groups and 1 control group of 15 teeth each. Standard access to the pulp chambers were performed with diamond burs. The lengths of the teeth were determined by the introduction of a size 15 K-file into the root canal until the tip reached the apical foramen. The working length for preparation of the canal is set 0.5 mm shorter than the measurement. Irrigation was performed using 2 ml of irrigant for every instrument change and finally rinsed using 5 ml of the respective solutions. The roots were then split with a chisel and hammer. One-half of each tooth was selected and prepared for SEM examination. After assembly on coded stubs, the specimens were placed in a vacuum chamber and sputter-coated with a 300 Å gold layer. The specimens were then analyzed using a Philips SEM XL 30. The dentinal wall of the cervical, middle and apical thirds was observed at magnifications of up to ×1000 for the presence/absence of smear layer and visualization of the entrance to dentinal tubules. Photomicrographs (×1000) of these areas on each of the coronal, middle and apical thirds were made Data were analyzed using Kruskal–Wallis test and Mann–Whitney U test.
