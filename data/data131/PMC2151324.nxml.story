Renal cell carcinoma (RCC) is a radio- and chemotherapy resistant tumor, which has a very high morbidity and mortality when metastasized. The current treatment options demonstrate limited efficacy and severe side-effects. Therefore, there is a need for new therapeutic strategies for RCC. As for other malignancies, monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) targeting tumor-associated antigens have been developed for RCC. One of these, mAb G250, targets the MN/CAIX/G250 antigen, which is ubiquitously expressed in clear cell RCC (ccRCC). ccRCC is the most common form of RCC with a prevalence of 80%. Expression of G250 in normal tissue is restricted to the gastrointestinal mucosa and related structures, thereby making it a suitable candidate for targeting ccRCC. In several clinical studies the efficient accumulation of mAb G250 in ccRCC has been demonstrated, resulting in high contrast images. G250-imaging could prove to be a valuable tool in diagnosing metastases in patients with a G250-antigen positive primary tumor and/or in the differential diagnosis of suspect kidney lesions. Furthermore, the therapeutic efficacy of radiolabeled G250 has been investigated in a series of studies. Thus far, most efforts have been devoted to G250 labeled with high doses of
