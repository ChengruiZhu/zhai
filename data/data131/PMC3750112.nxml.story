Retinoic acid (RA) is the most active metabolic product of Vitamin A. Appropriate levels of RA are required for proper embryonic development and tissue maintenance in all vertebrates. Inappropriate levels of RA in human embryos can cause congenital defects that affect many organs, including the heart and limbs, and lead to numerous types of cancers. Understanding how animals maintain appropriate RA levels and the consequences of inappropriate RA signaling will therefore provide insight into human congenital defects and diseases. RA signaling is mediated by RA receptors (RARs), which are transcription factors that are activated when binding RA. We have found that depletion of RARs in zebrafish results in defects that are surprisingly due to increases in embryonic RA and not a deficiency of RA signaling. Our results are the first to demonstrate that RAR depletion elicits a positive feedback mechanism that promotes RA signaling through complementary increases in both embryonic RA and RAR expression. Therefore, our analysis provides novel insight into the molecular mechanisms that are required to maintain appropriate RA signaling and will positively impact our understanding of the mechanisms underlying congenital defects.
