Chloride content and fluxes were measured in isolated resting human peripheral polymorphonuclear leukocytes. The intracellular Cl concentration of cells kept at 37 degrees C in 148 mM Cl media was approximately 80 meq/liter cell water, fourfold higher than expected for passive distribution at the cell's estimated membrane potential (approximately -53 mV). All intracellular Cl was rapidly exchangeable with external 36Cl. Cells lost Cl exponentially into Cl-free media, and reaccumulated it when Cl was restored to the bath; this reuptake was dependent on metabolism. One-way 36Cl fluxes in steady state cells were approximately 1.4 meq/liter X min. The bulk (approximately 70%) of these represented electrically silent Cl/Cl exchange mediated by a carrier insensitive to disulfonic stilbenes but blocked by the anion carrier inhibitor alpha-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamate (CHC). The remaining fluxes were characterized in some detail. About 20% of 36Cl influx behaved as active transport: it moved thermodynamically uphill and was absent in cells treated with 2-deoxy-D-glucose, displayed Michaelis- Menten kinetics with Km(Cl) congruent to 5 mM, Vmax congruent to 0.25 meq/liter X min, and was inhibited by CHC (Ki congruent to 1.7 mM), ethacrynate (Ki congruent to 50 microM), and furosemide (Ki congruent to 50 microM). About 30% of Cl efflux and approximately 8% of Cl influx behaved as electrodiffusion through a low-permeability pathway (PCl congruent to 4 X 10(-9) cm/s; gCl congruent to 1 microsecond/cm2; PK/PNa/PCl congruent to to 10:1:1); these fluxes were linear with concentration and strongly voltage sensitive. The putative Cl channel does not appear to be voltage gated, and gives evidence of single filing.
