We have defined the cell surface molecules of human monocytes and PMN that bind to the chymotryptic cell binding domain of Fn and to a synthetic peptide, KYAVTGRGDS, based on the sequence of Fn, by affinity chromatography. Monocytes express two receptors that differ in their affinity for CBD-Sepharose and peptide-Sepharose, but that both recognize the RGD sequence. Only a single receptor is purified from PMN, which resembles the monocyte surface molecule that binds to peptide-Sepharose. These receptors are not part of the Mac-1, LFA-1, p(150,95) family, but do have homology to the platelet Fn receptor, gpIIb/IIIa. Interestingly, the antigenic crossreactivity between gpIIb/IIIa and the phagocyte receptors purified on peptide-Sepharose is largely in the beta chain of the receptors. The alpha chains appear to be distinct, based on molecular weight, antigenic analysis, and ligand specificity. This receptor also seems to be the surface molecule on monocytes that is critical for phagocytosis enhancement by Fn. Thus, we have defined the phagocyte Fn receptor that transduces the signal for increased phagocytosis by monocytes; it may be a third member of a family of adhesion molecules that includes the gpIIb/IIIa of platelets and the vitronectin receptor of fibroblasts.
