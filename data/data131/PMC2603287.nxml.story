While HIV/AIDS therapy is very successful at controlling HIV infection, the therapy must continue for the remainder of the patient's life. Approximately one-fourth of these patients suffer from serious drug toxicity problems. It is generally believed that the toxicity of these drugs is caused by damage to mitochondria, the “power plants” of every cell. But we do not know exactly how this damage occurs. The most common explanation is that these drugs damage mitochondria in the same way that they control the virus, by interfering with DNA replication. We tested that idea by analyzing data for the interaction of several AIDS drugs with the mitochondrial DNA polymerase, the protein responsible for copying mitochondrial DNA. By using a detailed simulation of the mitochondrial DNA polymerase, we show that some of these drugs do interact well enough with the mitochondrial DNA polymerase to lead to toxic effects. However, many of these drugs, including the commonly used drug AZT, had very little toxic effect in this simulation although AZT often causes toxicity in patients. This indicates that the toxicity of AZT occurs through some other process and not through the direct interruption of mitochondrial DNA replication.
