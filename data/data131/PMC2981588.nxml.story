 The researchers used three data sources to find the information they needed: the national health care insurance database (which covers the whole French population and includes data on reimbursed prescription medicines), police reports, and the national police database of injurious road traffic crashes. Drivers involved in road traffic crashes (identified by their national healthcare number) between July 2005 and May 2008 were included in the study. The researchers used a statistical model to conduct a responsibility analysis, which determined factors associated with each driver responsible for the road traffic crash and each driver who was not responsible (controls). In addition, the researchers compared medicine exposure during a period immediately before the crash (case period) with exposure during an earlier period (control period) for each driver involved in a crash. The researchers retrieved data on reimbursed medicines, dispensed within six months of the road traffic crash, by linking included drivers to the national health care insurance database using their national ID, gender, and date of birth and grouped all prescribed medicines according to the four risk levels of the French classification system.
