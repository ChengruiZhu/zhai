The effectiveness of heart failure (HF) self-management interventions varies within patients suggesting that one size does not fit all. It is expected that effectiveness can be optimized when interventions are tailored to individual patients. The aim of this review was to synthesize the literature on current use of tailoring in self-management interventions and patient characteristics associated with self-management capacity and success of interventions, as building blocks for tailoring. Within available trials, the degree to which interventions are explicitly tailored is marginal and often limited to content. We found that certain patient characteristics that are associated with poor self-management capacity do not influence effectiveness of a given intervention (i.e., age, gender, ethnicity, disease severity, number of comorbidities) and that other characteristics (low: income, literacy, education, baseline self-management capacity) in fact are indicators of patients with a high likelihood for success. Increased scientific efforts are needed to continue unraveling success of self-management interventions and to validate the modifying impact of currently known patient characteristics.
