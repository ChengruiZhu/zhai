Circulating microRNAs (miRNAs) have been used as promising diagnostic biomarkers for esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC). We performed miRNA expression profiling using quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT‐PCR) based Exiqon panels from three ESCC pools and one normal control (NC) pool samples. Using qRT‐PCR, identified serum miRNAs were further confirmed in training (32 ESCC vs. 32 NCs) and testing stages (108 ESCC vs. 96 NCs). Consequently, five serum miRNAs (miR‐20b‐5p, miR‐28‐3p, miR‐192‐5p, miR‐223‐3p, and miR‐296‐5p) were significantly overexpressed in ESCC compared with NCs. The diagnostic value of the 5‐miRNA signature was validated by an external cohort (60 ESCC vs. 60 NCs). The areas under the receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC) of the 5‐miRNA signature were 0.753, 0.763, and 0.966 for the training, testing, and the external validation stages, respectively. The expression levels of the miRNAs were also determined in tissues, arterial serum, and exosomes. MiR‐20b‐5p, miR‐28‐3p, and miR‐192‐5p were significantly upregulated in ESCC tissues, while miR‐296‐5p was overexpressed in ESCC serum exosomes. In conclusion, we identified a 5‐miRNA signature in serum for the detection of ESCC.
