 mice were xenografted in the flank with U‐87 MG‐luc2 glioblastoma cells for tumor growth study following five intravenous (IV) injections of erymet with daily PN oral administration. Endpoints included efficacy and event‐free survival (EFS). Finally, a repeated dose toxicity study of erymet combined with PN cofactor was conducted in CD1 mice. Recombinant MGL was cytotoxic on 4/6 cell lines tested. MGL half‐life was increased from <24 h to 9–12 days when encapsulated in RBC. Conversion of PN into PLP by RBC was demonstrated. Combined erymet + PN treatment led to a sustained Met depletion in plasma for several days with a 85% reduction of tumor volume after 45 days following cells implantation, and a significant EFS prolongation for treated mice. Repeated injections in mice exhibited a very good tolerability with only minor impact on clinical state (piloerection, lean aspect) and a slight decrease in hemoglobin and triglyceride concentrations. This study demonstrated that encapsulation of methioninase inside erythrocyte greatly enhanced pharmacokinetics properties of the enzyme and is efficacy against tumor growth. The perspective on these results is the clinical evaluation of the erymet product in patients with Met starvation‐sensitive tumors.
