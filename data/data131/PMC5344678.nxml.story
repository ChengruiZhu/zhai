]. To test this hypothesis, we analyzed the properties of actin filaments decorated by stress-fiber-associated tropomyosins (Tpm1.6, Tpm1.7, Tpm2.1, Tpm3.1, Tpm3.2, and Tpm4.2). These proteins bound F-actin with high affinity and competed with α-actinin for actin filament binding. Importantly, total internal reflection fluorescence (TIRF) microscopy of fluorescently tagged proteins revealed that most tropomyosin isoforms cannot co-polymerize with each other on actin filaments. These isoforms also bind actin with different dynamics, which correlate with their effects on actin-binding proteins. The long isoforms Tpm1.6 and Tpm1.7 displayed stable interactions with actin filaments and protected filaments from ADF/cofilin-mediated disassembly, but did not activate non-muscle myosin IIa (NMIIa). In contrast, the short isoforms Tpm3.1, Tpm3.2, and Tpm4.2 displayed rapid dynamics on actin filaments and stimulated the ATPase activity of NMIIa, but did not efficiently protect filaments from ADF/cofilin. Together, these data provide experimental evidence that tropomyosin isoforms segregate to different actin filaments and specify functional properties of distinct actin filament populations.
