A key goal in biology is to identify specific ligands for specific receptors. One example is where the ligand is a drug. In turn, in the olfactory system the ligand is the odorant that binds to olfactory receptors. There are many olfactory receptor types, and which odorants will activate which receptors remains largely unknown. One way to answer this is to systematically vary the molecular features of ligands and to measure the olfactory receptor response. However, the vast number of molecular features and their combinations renders such an effort potentially unsolvable. Here, rather than looking at the trees (each molecular feature), we looked at the forest (the smell they generate). We used a device called an electronic nose that generates a patterned response to odorants. We then obtained the response to a set of odorants that are known to activate a particular olfactory receptor, and we used this pattern to predict the response of that receptor to other odorants. We found that, on average in three out of four we could predict the response of olfactory receptors. This result provides a new method for probing the olfactory system, and also suggests a novel method for identifying potential drugs.
