Ribosome-inactivating proteins (RIPs) are enzymes (3.2.2.22) that possess N-glycosilase activity that irreversibly inhibits protein synthesis. RIPs have been found in plants, fungi, algae, and bacteria; their biological role is still under investigation, even if it has been recognized their role in plant defence against predators and viruses. Nevertheless, several studies on these toxins have been performed to evaluate their applicability in the biomedical field making RIPs selectively toxic towards target cells. Indeed, these molecules are extensively used to produce chimeric biomolecules, such as immunotoxins or protein/peptides conjugates. However, to date, clinical use of most of these bioconiujates has been limited by toxicity and immunogenicity. More recently, material sciences have provided a wide range of nanomaterials to be used as excellent vehicles for toxin-delivery, since they are characterized by improved stability, solubility, and in vivo pharmacokinetics. This review discusses progresses in the development of RIPs bioconjugates, with particular attention to the recent use of nanomaterials, whose appropriate design opens up a broad range of different possibilities to the use of RIPs in novel therapeutic approaches in human diseases.
