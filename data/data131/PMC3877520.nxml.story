Delisheng consists of radix ginseng, radix astragali, venenum bufonis and mylabris. It has been reported that delisheng inhibits the proliferation of adenocarcinoma cells and stimulates their apoptosis. Delisheng can also enhance the body's immunity and induce the redifferentiation of carcinoma cells. Delisheng inhibited the proliferation of HepG2 cells in MTT assay and promoted apoptosis more effectively in contrast to the active components of ginseng extract, Rg3 and gemcitabine. It is possible that Rg3 has an important role in delisheng because they all could regulate the cell cycle, apoptosis and expression of endostatin and VEGFR-2. Delisheng caused the cell cycle to arrest at the S phase, while gemcitabine blocked the cells at the G0/G1 phase in cell cycle analysis. Consequently, the apoptosis rate of the HepG2 cell line can be increased significantly by delisheng in combination with gemcitabine, compared with the single drug. The expression of the procaspase proteins, caspase protein, and dr5 detected by Western blot were increased while bcl-2 and survivin decreased in the delisheng group, compared with controls. The observations suggest that the delisheng induced apoptotic effect might be closely related to the mitochondrial apoptosis pathway, and the death receptor signaling pathway.
