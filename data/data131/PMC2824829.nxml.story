We used RNA interference to deplete endogenous dysbindin in HEK293 and HeLa cells, then used immunochemical and biochemical methods to assess expression and endocytic trafficking of epitope-tagged GPCRs. Dysbindin knockdown up-regulated surface expression of D2 receptors compared to D1 receptors, as reported previously in neurons. This regulation was not mediated by a change in D2 receptor endocytosis. Instead, dysbindin knockdown specifically reduced the subsequent trafficking of internalized D2 receptors to lysosomes. This distinct post-endocytic sorting function explained the minimal effect of dysbindin depletion on D1 receptors, which recycle efficiently and traverse the lysosomal pathway to only a small degree. Moreover, dysbindin regulated the delta opioid receptor, a more distantly related GPCR that is also sorted to lysosomes after endocytosis. Dysbindin was not required for lysosomal trafficking of all signaling receptors, however, as its depletion did not detectably affect down-regulation of the EGF receptor tyrosine kinase. Dysbindin co-immunoprecipitated with GASP-1 (or GPRASP-1), a cytoplasmic protein shown previously to modulate lysosomal trafficking of D2 dopamine and delta opioid receptors by direct interaction, and with HRS that is a core component of the conserved ESCRT machinery mediating lysosome biogenesis and sorting.
