Transcription in eukaryotes is widespread including both protein-coding transcripts and an increasing number of non-coding RNAs. Here we present the results of transcriptome-wide mapping of a set of yeast RNA–binding proteins that control expression of some protein-coding genes and a number of novel non-coding RNAs. The yeast Nrd1-Nab3-Sen1 pathway is required for termination and exosome-mediated processing of non-coding RNA polymerase II transcripts. Our data show that these components bind unexpected targets including a large number of antisense transcripts originating from the 3′ end of genes that are poorly expressed in the sense direction. We also show that Sen1 helicase, involved in termination of non-coding RNAs, is also present at the 3′ end of mRNAs, suggesting a more fundamental role in transcription termination. Mis-regulation of transcription is the underlying cause of many disease states. For example, mutation of the human Sen1 gene, senataxin, causes a range of neurodegenerative disorders. Understanding the roles of yeast RNA–binding proteins in controlling termination of coding and non-coding RNAs will be useful in deciphering the mechanism of these proteins in human cells.
