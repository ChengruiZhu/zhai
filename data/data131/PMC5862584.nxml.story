 molecule that simultaneously binds and neutralizes VEGF and HGF with high specificity and affinity. Here we studied the antiangiogenic effects of the MP0250 in multiple myeloma (MM). In endothelial cells (EC) isolated from bone marrow (BM) of MM patients (MMEC) MP0250 reduces VEGFR2 and cMet phosphorylation and affects their downstream signaling cascades. MP0250 influences the secretory profile of MMEC and inhibits their in vitro angiogenic activities (spontaneous and chemotactic migration, adhesion, spreading and capillarogenesis). Compared to anti-VEGF or anti-HGF neutralizing mAbs, MP0250 strongly reduces capillary network formation and vessel-sprouting in a Matrigel angiogenesis assay. MP0250 potentiates the effect of bortezomib in the same in vitro setting. It significantly reduces the number of newly formed vessels in the choriollantoic membrane assay (CAM) and the Matrigel plug assay. In the syngeneic 5T33MM tumor model, MP0250 decreases the microvessel density (MVD) and the combination MP0250/bortezomib lowers the percentage of idiotype positive cells and the serum levels of M-protein. Overall results define MP0250 as a strong antiangiogenic agent with potential as a novel combination drug for treatment of MM patients.
