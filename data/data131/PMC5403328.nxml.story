MicroRNA-193b (miRNA-193b) is often differentially expressed and is an important regulator of gene expression in colon cancer. The aim of the present study was to determine whether miRNA-193b affects cell growth in colon cancer and to investigate the potential underlying mechanisms. Patients with colorectal cancer (CRC; n=20) and healthy volunteers (n=10) were enrolled from the Department of Gastrointestinal Surgery Center, First Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-Sen University (Guangzhou, China). Western blot analysis was used to evaluate the protein expression of SMAD3 and transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) in the patient samples. It was determined that miRNA-193b expression was markedly elevated in the CRC tissue samples. Furthermore, silencing of miRNA-193bin SW620 CRC cells by specific inhibitors significantly reduced the cell proliferation and induced apoptosis. In addition, the downregulation of miRNA-193b significantly activated the protein expression of SMAD3 and TGF-β, and promoted caspase-3 activity in SW620 cells. The results of the present study suggested that the deregulation of miRNA-193b may affect cell growth in colon cancer via the TGF-β and SMAD3 signaling pathways.
