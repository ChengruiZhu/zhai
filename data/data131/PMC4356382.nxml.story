The identification of prognostic markers and establishing their value as therapeutic targets improves therapeutic efficacy against human cancers. Ribophorin II (RPN2) has been demonstrated to be a prognostic marker of human cancer, including breast and pancreatic cancers. The present study aimed to evaluate RPN2 expression in gastric cancer and to examine the possible correlation between RPN2 expression and the response of cells to clinical anticancer drugs, which has received little research attention at present. The gastric cancer AGS, TMC-1, SNU-1, TMK-1, SCM-1, MKN-45 and KATO III cell lines were used as a model to elucidate the role of RPN2 in the response of cells to six common chemotherapeutic agents, comprising oxaliplatin, irinotecan, doxorubicin, docetaxel, cisplatin and 5-fluorouricil. The functional role of RPN2 was assessed by silencing RPN2 using small interfering RNA (siRNA), and the cytotoxicity was determined by an MTS assay and analysis of apoptosis. Molecular events were evaluated by western blotting. All the anticancer drugs were found to exert a concentration-dependent decrease on the cell survival rate of each of the cell lines tested, although the RPN2 levels in the various cell lines were not directly correlated with responsiveness to clinical anticancer drugs, based on the calculated IC
