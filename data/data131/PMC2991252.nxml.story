The brain has an immensely complex wiring diagram, but few computational models of brain regions attempt accurate renditions of the wiring between neurons. Consequently, these models' dynamics may not accurately reflect those of the region. Key barriers here are the difficulty of reconstructing such networks and the paucity of critical data on neuron morphology. We demonstrate an approach that gets around these problems by using the available data to construct prototype neuron morphologies, and uses these to estimate how the probability of a connection between two neurons changes as we change the distance between them. With these in hand, we constructed artificial three-dimensional networks of the rat striatum and find that the connection distributions agree well with current estimates from anatomical studies. Our networks show features and dynamical implications of striatal wiring that would be difficult to intuit: the dominant input to the striatal projection neuron arises from other neurons just at the edge of its dendrites, and the main inhibitory interneurons are coupled locally by electrical connections and more distally by chemical synapses. Together, these properties set a unique state for the input-output computations of the striatum.
