MicroRNA-494 was revealed as an attractive prognostic biomarker in recent studies. Nevertheless, the prognostic value of microRNA-494 in cancers remains controversial. Current meta-analysis aims to elucidate the precise predictive value of microRNA-494 in various cancers. Eligible studies were identified through multiple search strategies, the hazard ratios (HRs) and their confidence interval (CI) for patient prognostic outcomes were extracted and estimated. The pooled results of fifteen studies indicated that elevated expression of microRNA-494 implies a good overall survival of cancer patients (HR = 0.58, 95% CI: 0.36–0.91); While no significant association was found between the high expression of microRNA-494 and clinicopathological characteristic. Additionally, subgroup analysis revealed that overexpression of microRNA-494 predicted a worse overall survival in non-small cell lung cancer (HR = 2.35, 95% CI: 1.05–5.24) and colorectal cancer (HR = 2.59, 95% CI: 1.62–4.14). As per the subgroup analysis, the cancer type, the anatomy system classification and the ethnic background had influence on the overall survival result. Our findings indicate that elevated expression of microRNA-494 might predict a good overall survival in most cancers, while in non-small cell lung cancer and colorectal cancer, overexpression of microRNA-494 might predict a worse overall survival.
