 was found to be of definite advantage in checking the progress of the infection. When administered during the period of incubation the serum was found capable of completely preventing the development of the disease, although on subsequent examination hemorrhagic lesions of greater or less number and extent were found in the lungs of the guinea pigs which survived. Moreover, the serum modified the course of the disease and when used in the early stages of infection prevented a fatal outcome. Employed at a later stage, however, when jaundice and nephritis had been present for several days and the animal was near collapse, the serum had no perceptible beneficial effect. This was, of course, to be expected in view of the incidence of various pathological phases of this diseaseâ€”nephritis, hepatitis, and other toxic symptoms in succession. In man the clinical manifestations are more gradual and distinct than in the guinea pig, yet the yellow fever patient whose temperature is sub-normal, and who has reached the stage of hemorrhages from the gums, nose, stomach, and intestines, and of uremia and cholemia, would seem to have little or no chance of deriving benefit from the use of a specific immune serum. This latter assumption would probably hold irrespective of the relation which
