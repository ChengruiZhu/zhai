To establish Z-score reference ranges for coronary sinus (CS) diameter in normal fetuses and explore the diagnostic value of CS Z-score in fetuses with persistent left superior vena cava (PLSVC). Study of 235 normal fetuses and 30 fetuses with PLSVC was involved. Noncardiac biometrical parameters included biparietal diameter (BPD), femoral length (FL), heart area (HA), gestation age (GA). The coronary sinus systolic and diastolic diameter (CSDs and CSDd ) were measured at the end of systole and diastole. CSDs and CSDd Z-score models were constructed by using linear regression analysis with Non-cardiac biometrical parameters as independent variables. Z-scores between normal fetuses and fetuses with PLSVC were compared. A simple, linear regression model was the best description and correlations between fetal CSDs and CSDd and four independent variables were excellent. Reference ranges for predicting means and SDs of the fetal CS were established. Equations for Z-score calculation were provided, CSDs and CSDd Z-scores were statistically different between normal fetuses and those with PLSVC. Development of CSDs and CSDd Z-score reference ranges in normal fetuses was realized. The CSDs and CSDd Z-scores can provide quantitative evidence in prenatal diagnosis of PLSVC.
