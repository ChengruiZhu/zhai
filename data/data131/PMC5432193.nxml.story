This work demonstrates a necessary computational tool for the development and implementation of molecular recorders, a promising potential technique for massive-scale neuroscience. Molecular recorders use proteins to encode levels of a substance we want to measure (e.g. calcium in neural applications) as detectable changes in a linear cellular structure, e.g. misincorporations in a strand of DNA, or fluorescent proteins traveling down a microtubule. This encoding represents levels of the measured substance over time, much like a ticker tape represents information linearly on a strip of paper. The unique intracellular nature of this approach promises a significant scaling advantage over current techniques. The molecular recording approach suffers a particular drawback involving timing: unlike most methods of recording signals, in simple molecular recording systems we do not observe when each data point was recorded. This timing information is almost always required in order to make associations between our recorded data and the rest of the experiment. In this work, we propose a method to estimate the timing of these data points using easily-observable experimental measurements. We demonstrate the application of this method in a simulated neuroscience paradigm, investigate the effect of experimental design on this method, and determine protein properties that would be desirable in molecular recorders. These findings are useful both as a computational proof-of-concept, and as guidelines for current efforts to engineer proteins for molecular recording.
