Blood vessels of tumors have abnormal structures, being irregular and tortuous. Oxygen supply to tumors is heterogeneous, with regions of low oxygen that resist radiation treatment and some types of chemotherapy. Blood vessels undergo continual structural change (adaptation) in response to blood flow and metabolite levels. Our hypothesis is that abnormal adaptation of tumor microvessels causes their heterogeneous structure and impaired function. We used computational models to estimate blood flow and oxygen delivery and to simulate diameter adaptation in networks of microvessels, using network structures derived from microscopic observations of living normal and tumor tissues. The simulation of adaptation depends on several parameters that describe vessel sensitivity to fluid shear stress, to blood pressure, to oxygen levels, and to signals propagated along vessel walls (conducted response). We found that structural adaptation of a tumor network using parameters derived from normal tissues could ‘normalize’ the network, giving it properties similar to a normal tissue. Conversely, adaptation of normal networks using parameters derived from the tumor network, including reduced conducted response, gave tumor-like properties. We conclude that the deviant properties of tumor microcirculation may result largely from defective structural adaptation, including reduced conducted responses.
