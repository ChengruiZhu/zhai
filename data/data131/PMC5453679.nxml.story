Very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) receptor is a member of the low-density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor family. It binds triglyceride rich lipoprotein (TGRL) but not LDL, because it recognizes apolipoprotein (apo)E only but not apoB. The VLDL receptor functions as a peripheral lipoprotein receptor in concert with lipoprotein lipase (LPL) in heart, muscle, adipose tissue and macrophages. In contrast to the LDL receptor, VLDL receptor binds apo E2/2 VLDL and apoE3/3 VLDL particles, and its expression is not down-regulated by intracellular lipoproteins. It has been reported that both LDL-cholesterol (LDL-C) and postprandial triglyceride (chyromicron and VLDL remnants) are risk factors for human atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD). True ligands such as lipoprotein particles of the VLDL receptor are chyromicron remnant (CMR) and VLDL remnant (postprandial hyperlipidemia). Although the oxidized LDL (oxLDL)-scavenger receptors pathway is considered to be the main mechanism for macrophage foam cell formation, it seems that the TGRL-LPL-VLDL receptor pathway is also involved. Since Lp(a) is one of the ligands for the VLDL receptor, the Lp(a)- VLDL receptor pathway is another potential alternative. The expression of VLDL receptor protein in mouse macrophages is modest compared to that in rabbit and human macrophages, both
