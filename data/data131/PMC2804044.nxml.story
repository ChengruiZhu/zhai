To generate functional modules as functionally and structurally cohesive formations in protein interaction networks (PINs) constitutes an important step towards understanding how modules communicate on a higher level of the PIN
organisation that underlies cell functionality. However, we need to understand how individual modules communicate and are organized into the higher-order structure(s) of the PIN organization that underlies cell functionality. In an attempt to contribute to this understanding, we make an assumption that the proteins reappearing in several modules, termed here as multimodular proteins (MMPs), may be useful in building higher-order structure(s) as they may constitute communication points between different modules. In this paper, we investigate common properties shared by these proteins and compare them with the properties of so-called single-modular proteins (SMPs) by analyzing three aspects: functional aspect, that is, annotation of the proteins, topological aspect that is betweenness centrality of the proteins, and lethality. Furthermore, we investigate the interconnectivity role of some proteins that are identified as functionally and topologically important.
