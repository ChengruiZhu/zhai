The neuroprotectant and memory enhancer supplement for menopause is required due to the side effects of hormone replacement therapy. Since purple waxy corn cob and pandan leaves exert antioxidant and acetylcholinesterase inhibition (AChEI) effects, we hypothesized that the combined extract of both plants (PCP) might provide synergistic effect leading to the improved brain damage and memory impairment in experimental menopause. To test this hypothesis, female Wistar rats were ovariectomized bilaterally and orally given various doses of the functional drink at doses of 20, 40, and 80â€‰mg/kg for 28 days. The animals were assessed nonspatial memory using object recognition test every 7 days throughout the study period. At the end of study, they were assessed with oxidative stress status, AChEI, neuron density, and ERK1/2 signal in the prefrontal cortex (PFC). Interestingly, all doses of PCP increased object recognition memory and neuron density but decreased oxidative stress status in PFC. Low dose of PCP also decreased AChE activity while medium dose of PCP increased phosphorylation of ERK1/2 in PFC. Therefore, the improved oxidative stress status and cholinergic function together with signal transduction via ERK in PFC might be responsible for the neuroprotective and memory-enhancing effects of PCP.
