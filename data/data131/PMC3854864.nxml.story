Cell cycle studies over the years have tried to elucidate the molecular mechanisms behind cell division, one of the most highly regulated of all cell processes, which ensures life in all organisms. Protein phosphorylation emerged as a key regulatory mechanism in the cell cycle. The highly conserved family of cyclin-dependent kinases, the Cdks, are considered the main component of the cell cycle control system. However, it has become clear that opposing phosphatases also play a key role in determining the phosphorylation state of the proteins. Cells enter mitosis when mitotic Cdk activity increases, having its pick of activity during metaphase. To exit mitosis, cells must coordinate chromosome segregation with Cdk inactivation processes involving the activation of protein phosphatases. Here we show that the phosphatase PP2A regulates the mitotic exit network (MEN) by counteracting the phosphorylation of Bfa1 and Mob1. Our findings provide new insights into the mechanism by which PP2A-Cdc55 functions affect the regulation of various MEN components that contribute to mitotic exit. The core signalling elements of the MEN, SIN and Hippo pathways are highly conserved. Therefore, studies of MEN regulation will contribute to our understanding of MEN-related pathways in other organisms.
