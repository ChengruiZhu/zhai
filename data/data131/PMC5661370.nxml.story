Hepatocarcinoma is a type of high-grade malignant carcinoma identified worldwide. Its rapid development and late diagnosis prevents effective tumor resection in the majority of patients, and therefore recent studies have targeted metabolic signaling pathways and the tumor microenvironment for potential treatments. To investigate whether endocan may be a gene target for hepatocarcinoma treatment, the present study employed the following measures: MTT and Transwell assays, flow cytometry, western blotting and an mRFP-GFP-LC3 double fluorescence system. Following endocan gene silencing, cell proliferation was significantly inhibited and the number of invasive cells in the endocan siRNA-treated group was reduced compared with the control-siRNA treated-group. Furthermore, the apoptosis rate was 15% and autophagy was detected in the endocan short interfering (si)RNA-treated group compared with the control-siRNA treated-group. Using western blotting to detect NF-κB expression in the nucleus, the NF-κB expression was identified to be significantly reduced in the siRNA-treated group compared with the control groups. Endocan gene silencing inhibited hepatocarcinoma cell viability and invasion, whilst inducing apoptosis and autophagy. The results of the present study suggest that the effect of endocan gene silencing on cell survival was mediated via the NF-κB signaling pathway.
