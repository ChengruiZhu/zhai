Background: The adverse effects of heatwaves on mortality are well recognised. Heatwaves are predicted to become more frequent and severe in coming decades. Englandâ€™s National Heatwave Plan (NHP) aims to prepare the country for periods of extreme heat and thereby limit adverse health effects. The central aim of this study is to understand how effectively the NHP is disseminated within an acute hospital and to identify any barriers to its use.
Methods: Qualitative data was collected through semi-structured interviews and focus groups with key hospital managers, nurses and healthcare assistants. All participants were recruited from a single hospital in the South East of England. Data were analysed using Framework Analysis.
Results: We conducted two focus groups with frontline clinical staff and five interviews with senior managers, all of whom deemed the NHP a low priority. Hospital managers showed good awareness of the plan, which was lacking amongst frontline staff. Nevertheless front line staff were familiar with the dangers of excess heat and felt that they individualised care accordingly. Communication of information between managers and frontline staff was highlighted as a problem during heatwaves. Additionally, issues with inadequate building stock and equipment limited effective implementation of the plan. Participants were able to suggest novel improvements to the plan.
Conclusions: Increased awareness and improved communication could help better integrate the NHP into the clinical practice of English hospital-based healthcare professionals. Further evaluation of the NHP in acute care trusts and other health care settings is warranted to expand upon these initial findings.
