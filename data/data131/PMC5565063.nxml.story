The mean age of the reconstruction patients was 43.0 vs. 29.1 for the repair patients (p<0.001). The repair group had 45% mild and 55% moderate tears; the CLR group had 80% severe tears or segmental defects and 20% moderate tears. 3.9% of the repair group were revision procedures, while 35% of the CLR group were revision procedures. Pre-op Tonnis grade in the CLR group was 0.44 vs. 0.11 (P<0.001). Follow-up rate was 82% with a minimum follow-up of 23 months (range: 23-28 months). In the CLR group, 5 patients failed; 1 for core muscle repair procedure, 2 went on to subsequent hip arthroplasty, 2 in need of hip arthroplasty. All 4 conversions to arthroplasty had pre-op tonnis grade of 2. 3 procedures failed in the repair group with one subsequent core muscle repair and 2 revisions to labral reconstruction. In the reconstruction group, the mean Pain VAS score decreased from 4.78 preoperatively to 1.9 postoperatively (P<0.001), IHOT-12 scores increased from 32.38 to 68.9 (P<0.001), and mHHS increased from 48.67 to 74.63 (P<0.001). The SF-12 survey exhibited an increase from 36.29 to 43.15 (P=0.028), HOS-ADL scores increased from 56.28 to 87.47 (P<0.001), and HOS-SSS scores increased from 32.40 to 68.55 (P=0.0028). These improvements were not statistically different from those observed in the repair group (Pain VAS: P=0.361; HOS-ADL: P=0.314; HOS-SSS: P=0.288; mHHS: P=0.996; IHOT: P=0.192; SF: P=0.642). Intra-observer reliability of sidearm video study Kappa = 0.66 indicating moderately good reliability in the grading of severity of labral damage.
