In this work, we define a novel concept of a disease variation profile and carry out comparative analyses to find similarities and differences in the genetic architectures of common diseases. Studying genetic variation across autoimmune disease in particular allows us to systematically identify allele-specific relationships. We find polymorphisms where the alleles are significantly similarly associated with multiple autoimmune conditions as well as polymorphisms where alleles are significantly differentially associated with multiple conditions. We apply this method to compare genetic variation profiles of six autoimmune diseases: multiple sclerosis (MS), ankylosing spondylitis (AS), autoimmune thyroid disease (ATD), rheumatoid arthritis (RA), Crohn's disease (CD), and type 1 diabetes (T1D), as well as five non-autoimmune diseases. We find two autoimmune disease groups where SNPs that make an individual susceptible to one class of autoimmune disease also protect from diseases in the other autoimmune class. As more genome-wide association data becomes available, future studies could be done across tens or hundreds of diseases yielding the commonalities and differences in genetic architectures across all of human disease.
