Tumor neo-vasculature is characterized by spatial coordination of endothelial cells with mural cells, which delivers oxygen and nutrients. Here, we explored a key role of the secreted glycoprotein YKL-40, a mesenchymal marker, in the interaction between endothelial cells and mesenchymal mural-like cells for tumor angiogenesis. Xenotransplantation of tumor-derived mural-like cells (GSDCs) expressing YKL-40 in mice developed extensive and stable blood vessels covered with more GSDCs than those in YKL-40 gene knockdown tumors. YKL-40 expressed by GSDCs was associated with increased interaction of neural cadherin/β-catenin/smooth muscle alpha actin; thus, mediating cell-cell adhesion and permeability. YKL-40 also induced the interaction of vascular endothelial cadherin/β-catenin/actin in endothelial cells (HMVECs). In cell co-culture systems, YKL-40 enhanced both GSDC and HMVEC contacts, restricted vascular leakage, and stabilized vascular networks. Collectively, the data inform new mechanistic insights into the cooperation of mural cells with endothelial cells induced by YKL-40 during tumor angiogenesis, and also enhance our understanding of YKL-40 in both mural and endothelial cell biology.
