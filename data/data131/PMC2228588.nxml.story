A study of the mechanisms of the effects of amphotericin B and ouabain on cell membrane and transepithelial potentials and intracellular K activity (alpha Ki) of Necturus gallbladder epithelium was undertaken with conventional and K-selective intracellular microelectrode techniques. Amphotericin B produced a mucosa-negative change of transepithelial potential (Vms) and depolarization of both apical and basolateral membranes. Rapid fall of alpha Ki was also observed, with the consequent reduction of the K equilibrium potential (EK) across both the apical and the basolateral membrane. It was also shown that, unless the mucosal bathing medium is rapidly exchanged, K accumulates in the unstirred fluid layers near the luminal membrane generating a paracellular K diffusion potential, which contributes to the Vms change. Exposure to ouabain resulted in a slow decrease of alpha Ki and slow depolarization of both cell membranes. Cell membrane potentials and alpha Ki could be partially restored by a brief (3-4 min) mucosal substitution of K for Na. Under all experimental conditions (control, amphotericin B, and ouabain), EK at the basolateral membrane was larger than the basolateral membrane equivalent emf (Eb). Therefore, the K chemical potential difference appears to account for Eb and the magnitude of the cell membrane potentials, without the need to postulate an electrogenic Na pump. Comparison of the rate of Na transport across the tissue with the electrodiffusional K flux across the basolateral membrane indicates that maintenance of a steady-state alpha Ki cannot be explained by a simple Na,K pump-K leak model. It is suggested that either a NaCl pump operates in parallel with the Na,K pump, or that a KCl downhill neutral extrusion mechanism exists in addition to the electrodiffusional K pathway.
