Many neural computations, including sensory and motor processing, require neurons to control their sensitivity (often termed ‘gain’) to stimuli. One common form of gain manipulation is divisive gain control, where the neural response to a specific stimulus is simply scaled by a constant. Most previous theoretical and experimental work on divisive gain control have assumed input statistics to be constant in time. However, realistic inputs can be highly time-varying, often with time-varying statistics, and divisive gain control remains to be extended to these cases. A widespread mechanism for divisive gain control for static inputs is through an increase in stimulus independent membrane fluctuations. We address the question of whether this divisive gain control scheme is indeed operative for time-varying inputs. Using simplified spiking neuron models, we employ accurate theoretical methods to estimate the dynamic neural response. We find that gain control via membrane fluctuations does indeed extend to the time-varying regime, and moreover, the degree of divisive scaling does not depend on the timescales of the driving input. This significantly increases the relevance of this form of divisive gain control for neural computations where input statistics change in time, as expected during normal sensory and motor behavior.
