MicroRNAs (miRNAs) have been demonstrated to play an important role in regulation of the immuno-inflammatory response; however, the function of miRNAs in periodontal inflammation has not been investigated. The objective of this study was to explore the properties of miRNAs in periodontal inflammation by comparing miRNA profiles of inflamed and healthy gingival tissues. Gingival tissues were obtained from 10 periodontitis patients and 10 healthy subjects. After RNA extraction, miRNA profiles were analyzed by microarray, and expression levels of selected miRNAs were confirmed by real-time quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Analyses using two computational methods, Targetscan and MicroRNA.org, were combined to identify common targets of these miRNAs. Finally, the individual miRNA expression levels of three toll-like receptor (TLR)-related miRNAs from inflamed and healthy gingival tissues were evaluated by RT-PCR. Ninety-one miRNAs were found to be upregulated and thirty-four downregulated over two-fold in inflamed gingival tissue compared with those in healthy gingival tissue. Twelve selected inflammatory-related miRNAs, hsa-miR-126*, hsa-miR-20a, hsa-miR-142-3p, hsa-miR-19a, hsa-let-7f, hsa-miR-203, hsa-miR-17, hsa-miR-223, hsa-miR-146b, hsa-miR-146a, hsa-miR-155, and hsa-miR-205 showed comparable expression levels by microarray and real-time quantitative RT-PCR analyses. In addition, the putative inflammation targets of these miRNAs were predicted, and three that were tested (hsa-miRNA-146a, hsa-miRNA-146b, and hsa-miRNA-155), showed significant differences between inflamed and healthy gingiva. This remarkable difference in miRNA profiles between periodontal diseased and healthy gingiva implicates a probable close relationship between miRNAs and periodontal inflammation. The data also suggest that the regulation of TLRs in periodontal inflammation may involve miRNA pathways.
