Although pervasive in the living world, collective behavior is a puzzle for evolutionary biology. The genetic traits that sustain it are costly for their carriers and make them vulnerable to the exploitation of asocial “free-riders” that benefit from the group without contributing to its cohesion. This paradox has spawned an extensive literature mainly concerned with elaborate cooperative behaviors that might be inoperant for simple biological entities such as microbes. We model successive life cycles of aggregation, reproduction and dispersal in a biological population combining a statistical physics approach to mimic the group formation process and an evolutionary game theory approach to account for the conflict between individual competition and collective success. Our results show a parsimonious way to the advent of sociality based on differential physical adhesion in organisms deprived of complex cognitive abilities. We also stress the key role of ungrouped individuals and specify the conditions on motion properties that make sociality possible. In detailing a mechanism akin to promote social behavior in microbes in the absence of genealogical relatedness, our work might shed light on both the maintenance of facultative multicellular lifestyles and the evolutionary origins of multicellularity.
