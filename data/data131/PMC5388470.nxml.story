When organisms colonize a new environment in replicate, natural selection often leads to similar phenotypic adaptations. Such “convergent evolution” is known from both distant relatives, e.g., sea cows and whales adapting to an aquatic life, and from multiple populations within a species, but the causing genetic changes are rarely known. Here, we studied how a fish, the threespine stickleback, repeatedly adapted its color vision to living in red light–dominated blackwater lakes. Using multiple natural populations and a 19-y evolution experiment, we found selection on a blue light–sensitive visual pigment gene. One allele of this gene with a red-shifted light sensitivity facilitated repeated blackwater colonization. Surprisingly, two amino acid changes responsible for the red-shift have independently occurred 198 million years earlier, after the gene was duplicated in the ancestor of all spiny-rayed fish and modified into blue- and red-shifted gene copies. While other fish species today use these two gene copies to adapt to clear- and blackwater, stickleback have lost a copy and reevolved these mutations on different alleles of the same gene causing convergent adaptation to these habitats. Thus, we conclude that the same genetic changes can be responsible for convergent evolution on very different time scales.
