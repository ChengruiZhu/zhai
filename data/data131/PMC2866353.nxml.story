Two UV Spectrophotometric and one reverse phase high performance liquid chromatography methods have been developed for the simultaneous estimation of amlodipine besilate and olmesartan medoxomil in tablet dosage form. First UV spectrophotometric method was a determination using the simultaneous equation method at 237.5 nm and 255.5 nm over the concentration range 10-50 μg/ml and 10-50 μg/ml, for amlodipine besilate and olmesartan medoxomil with accuracy 100.09%, and 100.22% respectively. Second UV spectrophotometric method was a determination using the area under curve method at 242.5-232.5 nm and 260.5-250.5 nm over the concentration range of 10-50 μg/ml and 10-50 μg/ml, for amlodipine besilate and olmesartan medoxomil with accuracy 100.10%, and 100.48%, respectively. In reverse phase high performance liquid chromatography analysis carried out using 0.05M potassuim dihydrogen phosphate buffer:acetonitrile (50:50 v/v) as the mobile phase and Kromasil C18 (4.6 mm i.d.×250 mm) column as the stationery phase with detection wavelength of 238 nm. Flow rate was 1.0 ml/min. Retention time for amlodipine besilate and olmesartan medoxomil were 3.69 and 5.36 min, respectively. Linearity was obtained in the concentration range of 4-20 μg/ml and 10-50 μg/ml for amlodipine besilate and olmesartan medoxomil, respectively. Proposed methods can be used for the estimation of amlodipine besilate and olmesartan medoxomil in tablet dosage form provided all the validation parameters are met.
