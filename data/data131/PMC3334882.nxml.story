Translation Initiation Factor 2 (IF2) is a bacterial protein that plays an essential role in the initiation of protein synthesis. As such, it not only has an important influence on cellular growth but also is subject to regulation in response to physiological conditions such as nutritional deprivation. Biochemical characterization of IF2's function in replicating movable genetic elements has suggested a new role in the maintenance of genome integrity, potentially regulating replication restart. The parasitic elements exploit the cellular replication restart system to duplicate themselves as they transpose to new positions of the chromosome. In this process, IF2 makes way for action of restart proteins, which assemble replication enzymes for initiation of DNA synthesis. For the bacterial cell, the restart system is the means by which it copes with accidents that result in arrest of chromosomal replication, promoting resumption of replication. We present evidence for an IF2 function associated with restart proteins, allowing chromosomal replication in the presence of DNAâ€“damaging agents. As the IF2 function is a highly conserved one found in all organisms, the findings have implications for understanding the maintenance of genome integrity with respect to physiological status, which can be sensed by the translation apparatus.
