Recently many studies began to investigate the brain signature of complex cognitive functions such as decision confidence, the feeling of certainty/uncertainty associated with a decision. To this aim, the uncertain option task has been widely adopted in order to assess the confidence in animals. In this study we present a model, detailed at the neuron and synapse level, able to account for the behavior of animals in this task. In addition our model is able to reproduce the neural dynamics found in monkeys brain during this task. However our model is only equipped with a simple multiple choice mechanism and has no mechanism devoted to calculate the confidence. Therefore our study support the idea that the uncertain option task can be solved without relying on confidence assessment (metacognition). The model is based on the idea that the neural dynamics fluctuates around stable equilibrium points (attractors) and associates the landscape of these attractors with the behavior of the monkeys. Finally, our model makes several predictions that could be easily tested in a new experiment. One of these predictions may help distinguish our model from a different one that has been recently proposed.
