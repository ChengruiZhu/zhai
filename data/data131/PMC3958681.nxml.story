The aim of this study was to evaluate cytotoxicity of direct pulp capping materials such as Dycal, Life, ProRoot MTA, and Super-Bond C&B on L929 fibroblasts. Freshly mixed or set materials were prepared and eluted by incubation with cell culture medium for working time period (fresh) or for 6 hours (set). The cells were exposed to media containing elutes for 24 hours, after which the cell survival was evaluated by MTS assays. In freshly mixed materials, average ± standard deviation % cell viabilities were 40.2 ± 14.0%, 43.7 ± 16.0%, 72.9 ± 12.7%, and 66.0 ± 13.6% for Dycal, Life, ProRoot MTA, and Super-Bond C&B, respectively. There was no statistical difference in cell viabilities among material groups, whereas in set materials, the cell viabilities were 48.7 ± 14.8%, 37.2 ± 10.6%, 46.7 ± 15.2%, and 100 ± 21.9% for Dycal, Life, ProRoot MTA, and Super-Bond C&B, respectively. Super-Bond C&B showed more cell viabilities than the other three material groups (P < 0.05). The four vital pulp therapy materials had similar cytotoxicity when the materials were fresh. Super-Bond C&B was less cytotoxic than Dycal, Life, and ProRoot MTA after the materials were set, which suggests the use of SB-C&B in future
