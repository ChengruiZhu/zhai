Spinocerebellar Ataxia type 1 (SCA1) is one of nine neurodegenerative diseases caused by an increase in the number of the amino acid glutamine in their respective proteins. Genetic studies have pointed to the fact that the glutamine expansion in Ataxin-1 causes SCA1 by causing Ataxin-1 to gain some function(s). Here, we demonstrate that in addition to the toxic gain-of-function mechanism, partial loss of the normal functions of Ataxin-1 contributes to SCA1. Ataxin-1 forms protein complexes with Capicua, a protein that silences expression of other genes, and we found that in SCA1 mouse models the levels of these complexes are reduced, resulting in increased expression of some genes. We also demonstrate that increased levels of Ataxin-1-Like, a protein that is similar to Ataxin-1 and protects against mutant Ataxin-1 in mice, rescues molecular and behavioral defects in mice deficient in Ataxin-1. These results show that Ataxin-1-Like compensates for loss of Ataxin-1 and that Ataxin-1 and Ataxin-1-Like share some normal functions. Together, these findings suggest that rescue of SCA1 symptoms by Ataxin-1-Like could be partly due to restoration of lost normal functions of Ataxin-1 in mice that express the mutant polyglutamine-expanded Ataxin-1.
