The aim of the current study was to examine the liposuction-induced metabolic changes with regard to release of major adipokines and insulin sensitivity in overweight male patients. Seventeen overweight male patients aged 37.15 ± 9.60 years (6 with diabetes type 2, 11 without comorbidities) and 10 age-matched healthy lean controls were enrolled in the study. Using Vibration Amplification of Sound Energy at Resonance System, ultrasound assisted liposuction was applied onto the deep layers of abdominal subcutaneous adipose tissue. The mean volume supranatant fat was 2208 ± 562 ml. To eliminate the confounding effects of postsurgical inflammation and to evaluate delayed metabolic effects, fasting blood was collected on the day of liposuction, within 1 to 2 months and more than 6 months after surgery. Serum leptin, soluble receptor for leptin, adiponectin, insulin, and glucose concentrations were tested and insulin sensitivity was calculated using updated model Homeostasis Model Assessment 2. Both treatment groups (diabetic and nondiabetic patients) experienced similar postsurgical weight reduction with concomitant lowering of body mass index value at 1 to 2 months follow-up, which was sustained after 6 months from surgery. Improvement in insulin sensitivity at 1 to 2 months follow-up was observed (
