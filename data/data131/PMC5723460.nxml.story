 v6.2b, Philips Radiation Oncology Systems, Milpitas, CA). Inverse planning was assessed by observing the reduction in objective function as fields were successively added to three‐field prostate, esophagus, and thyroid plans. The ability of the treatment planning system to calculate dose for a segmented field was examined by creating a stepped field with five successively narrowing segments. The complete planning process was then investigated by using two orthogonal IMRT fields to create a homogeneous dose distribution in a cubic water phantom. Finally, a clinical situation was simulated by creating a five‐field segmental IMRT plan for a lung target in an anthropomorphic phantom. A conformal plan was also compared for context. Addition of fields to inverse plans generally resulted in a reduction of objective function, indicating consistency of inverse planning solutions. Planned dose for fields with stepped intensity agreed with ionization chamber measurements to within 5%. For orthogonal fields, planned dose distributions agreed well with dose measured using film and agreed with ionization chamber measurements to within 3%. For the anthropomorphic phantom, the standard deviation of difference between planned and measured dose was 4%. Although no consensus has yet been reached on what constitutes an acceptable IMRT plan, these results indicate that step‐and‐shoot IMRT can be planned and delivered using the system described with comparable accuracy to a standard conformal treatment.
