The nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) plays a central role in the activation and survival of lymphocytes. NF-κB, therefore, is pivotal for acquired immunity, but the dysregulation of NF-κB signaling leads to inflammatory diseases and lymphomagenesis. Accumulating evidence has demonstrated that the mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) lymphoma-related molecules, B-cell lymphoma 10 (BCL10) and MALT-lymphoma-translocation gene1 (MALT1), are essential signaling components for NF-κB and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) activation, mediated by the immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif (ITAM)-coupled receptors involved in both innate and adaptive immunity. CARMA1 (also referred to as CARD11 and Bimp3) is a crucial regulator for ITAM-mediated signaling as it forms a complex with BCL10-MALT1 in lymphoid lineage cells such as T, B, natural killer (NK), and natural killer T (NKT) cells, known as the lymphoid CARMA1-BCL10-MALT1 (L-CBM) complex. In this review, recent understanding of the molecular and biological functions and the signal regulation mechanisms of the L-CBM complex are described and its role in disease development and potential as a therapeutic target is further discussed.
