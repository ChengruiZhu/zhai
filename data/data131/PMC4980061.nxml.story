Microsaccades are small, fixational eye movements that precisely relocate the visual axis. Despite evidence that microsaccades can be strategically controlled in high-acuity visual tasks, impacting visual processing, and considerable knowledge about how microsaccades are generated by the oculomotor brainstem, little is known about the cortical substrates that control microsaccades. To address this gap, we examined microsaccades generated by non-human primates before, during, and after large-volume reversible unilateral or bilateral inactivation of the frontal eye fields, a key oculomotor area in the frontal cortex. In support of a role for the frontal eye fields in microsaccades, microsaccade metrics and kinematics were altered during frontal eye fields inactivation. More surprisingly, frontal eye fields inactivation also impaired the generation of microsaccades following presentation of peripheral cues, regardless of the side of the cue or inactivation configuration. To our knowledge, our results constitute the first direct evidence for the contribution of any cortical area to microsaccade generation and suggest that the frontal eye fields can provide the top-down signals to the oculomotor brainstem needed to strategically guide microsaccades.
