 leaf extract against aspirin-induced ulcers was investigated in rats. Thirty (30) rats under starvation but with access to drinking water for 48 h were divided into 6 groups of 5 animals each. Animals in groups 1 and 2 were pretreated with 0.2 ml normal saline via the oral route. Group 3 received 32 mg/kg cimetidine while those in groups 4, 5 and 6 received oral Moringa leaf extract treatments at doses 200, 400 and 800 mg/kg body weight respectively. Thirty minutes after treatment, all animals in groups 2 to 6 were given 800 mg/kg Aspirin to induce ulcer. Results obtained showed complete erosion of the superficial epithelium with complete loss of the mucus globules and sloughing off of immediate underlying cells and sparsely distributed intraepithelial lymphocytes in the stomach of rats in which no treatment was given and significantly differed from those of the normal control animals which were essentially intact. No significant gastroprotection was observed in rats pretreated with the lowest dose of the extract (200 mg/kg) as a high degree of intestinal mucosal lesions and complete erosion of the surface epithelium with intraepithelial haemorrhage, moderate inflammation and tissue oedema were observed. Pretreatment with 400 mg/kg, however, offered a mild degree of protection with patches of surface epithelial protection and mucus globules, even though there was still predominant disintegration and sloughing off of superficial and underlying epithelial cells. The level of protection was sufficiently increased in animals treated with 800 mg/kg Moringa extract as there was increased protection of surface epithelium with more mucus globules and compared favourably with the effect of Cimetidine in which patches of intact superficial cells were observed. Moringa leaf extract may contain active agents with gastroprotective and mucus enhancing activities and could be harnessed into safe and potent treatment agents for ulcer in addition to providing template for the development of new antiulcer agents.
