Multidrug resistance is a great obstacle in successful chemotherapy of colorectal cancer. However, the molecular mechanism underlying multidrug resistance is not fully understood. Dishevelled, a pivot in Wnt signaling, has been linked to cancer progression, while its role in chemoresistance remains unclear. Here, we found that Dishevelled1-3 was over-expressed in multidrug-resistant colorectal cancer cells (HCT-8/VCR) compared to their parental cells. Silencing Dishevelled1-3 resensitized HCT-8/VCR cells to multiple drugs including vincristine, 5-fluorouracil and oxaliplatin. Moreover, Dishevelled1-3 increased the protein levels of multidrug resistance protein 1 (P-gp/MDR1), multidrug resistance-associated protein 2 (MRP2), and breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP), Survivin and Bcl-2 which are correlated with multidrug resistance. shβ-catenin abolished Dishevelled-mediated these protein expressions. Unexpectedly, none of Dishevelled1-3 controlled β-catenin accumulation and nuclear translocation. Furthermore, the nuclear translocations of Dishevelled1-3 were promoted in HCT-8/VCR cells compared to HCT-8. Dishevelled1-3 bound to β-catenin in nucleus, and promoted nuclear complex formation and transcription activity of β-catenin/TCF. Taken together, Dishevelled1-3 contributed to multidrug resistance in colorectal cancer via activating Wnt/β-catenin signaling and inducing the expressions of P-gp, MRP2, BCRP, Survivin and Bcl-2, independently of β-catenin accumulation and nuclear translocation. Silencing Dishevelled1-3 resensitized multidrug-resistant colorectal cancer cells, providing a novel therapeutic target for successful chemotherapy of colorectal cancer.
