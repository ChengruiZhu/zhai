All cells can detect and respond to signals in their environment. The ability to interpret these signals with accuracy is needed for proper growth and differentiation. Moreover, cells must prioritize responses when confronted with competing signals. However the molecular mechanisms that govern signal prioritization are poorly understood. To address this question, we studied two signaling pathways in the genetic model organism budding yeast. Specifically we focused on the pheromone mating (differentiation) pathway and the high osmolarity glycerol (stress response) pathway. These pathways respond differently to each stimulus despite sharing pathway components. We find that cells must first adapt to stress before they can mate. At early times, the stress response cross-inhibits and dampens the pheromone response to suspend mating differentiation. Once cells adapt, the stress response ends and the differentiation program resumes. All signaling pathways that regulate cell fate decisions are interconnected to varying degrees. Our study highlights the importance of proper signal coordination in cell fate decisions, and it reveals new mechanisms that govern signal coordination within complex signaling networks.
