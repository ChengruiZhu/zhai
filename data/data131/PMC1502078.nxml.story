Arrhythmogenic right ventricular dysplasia/cardiomyopathy is a disorder characterized by frequent ventricular tachycardia originating from the right ventricle and fibro-fatty replacement of right ventricular myocardium. Though the disorder was originally described during surgical ablation of refractory ventricular tachycardia, catheter ablation of tachycardia is one of the options for patients not responding to anti arrhythmic agents. Direct current fulguration was used in the initial phase followed by radiofrequency catheter ablation. In the present day scenario, all patients with risk for sudden cardiac death should receive an implantable cardioverter defibrillator. Radiofrequency catheter ablation remarkably reduces the frequency of defibrillator therapies. Direct current fulguration can still be considered in cases when radiofrequency ablation fails, though it requires higher expertise, general anesthesia and carries a higher morbidity. Newer mapping techniques have helped in identification of the site of ablation. In general, the success rate of ablation in arrhythmogenic right ventricular dysplasia is less than in other forms of right ventricular tachycardias like right ventricular outflow tract tachycardia.
