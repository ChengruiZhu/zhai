Expression of enhancer of zeste homolog 2 (EZH2) has been implicated in cancer pathology, but research on its mechanistic activity is limited. The present study sought to assess the levels expression of EZH2 in patients with endometrial carcinoma (EC) and to explore the effects of EZH2 downregulation on the biological behavior of endometrial carcinoma RL-952 cells. Samples were obtained from a total of 104 patients with EC and an immunohistochemical assay was used to detect the expression of EZH2 in cancer and adjacent tissues. The relationship between the expression of EZH2 and the clinicopathological features was analyzed. Endometrial carcinoma RL-952 cells were transfected with chemically synthesized siRNA to conduct targeting inhibition of EZH2 expression. The expression levels of EZH2 protein were detected by immunoblotting. MTT and Transwell assays were used to detect the changes of cell proliferation and invasion after EZH2 downregulation. Of the 104 cases of endometrial carcinoma samples, 71 cases showed positive expression of EZH2, with an expression rate of 68.27%. In 104 cases of adjacent tissue samples, 25 cases showed positive expression of EZH2, with an expression rate of 24.03%. The expression of EZH2 in endometrial carcinoma tissue was significantly higher than that in adjacent tissue (P<0.05). The expression of EZH2 in endometrial carcinoma tissue was not correlated with the menopausal status and age of patients (P>0.05), but was correlated with the histological grade, depth of tumor invasion, lymph node metastasis and TNM stage (P<0.05). The expression of E2H2 was significantly downregulated by si-E2H2 and the proliferation and invasion abilities of cells were significantly reduced after EZH2 downregulation (P<0.05). EZH2 is closely related to the development of endometrial carcinoma and can enhance the proliferative activity of endometrial carcinoma RL-952 cells and promote cell invasion.
