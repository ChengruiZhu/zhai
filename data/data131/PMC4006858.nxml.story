Harnessing the host immune system to eradicate cancer has a high therapeutic potential. One paradigm of anticancer immunotherapy is represented by allogeneic stem cell transplantation. In this setting, the host must be conditioned prior to transplantation, allowing for engraftment and subsequent graft-vs.-tumor reactivity. Conditioning may also be a prerequisite for the efficacy of other immunotherapeutic regimens. In particular, tumor debulking followed by conditioning (aimed at blocking endogenous inhibitory stimuli, for instance upon the depletion of regulatory T cells or the inhibition of immune checkpoints) and subsequent immunization (for instance by means of patient-tailored vaccines) based on innovative adjuvants (such as RIG-I ligands) may allow for the elicitation of superior antitumor immune responses. Repetitive boosting might then maintain immunosurveillance. An intense wave of investigation on the optimal timing of immunostimulatory interventions with respect to the administration of immunogenic chemotherapeutics and on the use of small drugs that promote efficient antitumor immune responses will end up in the generation of highly effective immunotherapeutic anticancer regimens.
