Meiosis is an essential feature of sexual reproduction that maintains chromosome number over generations. This specialised form of cell division creates gametes containing a single copy of each chromosome so that each parent contributes half their genetic information to an offspring. Accurate partitioning first requires intimate association of the two parental copies of each chromosome and concomitant exchange between them. These exchanges consist of both large-scale reciprocal crossovers, essential for correct chromosome segregation, and very localised gene conversion events, or noncrossovers, thought to be involved in correct chromosome pairing. Ordinarily, the reshuffling of genetic variants between generations by recombination will not alter their population frequency only their haplotypic context, with a parent passing on a given variant to 50% of its gametes according to Mendel's law of inheritance. However, by screening for both types of recombinant amongst the sperm DNA of healthy men, we have identified a novel form of biased transmission that is restricted to noncrossovers and favours eventual fixation of one variant over another in the population. This previously undetected source of meiotic drive will not alter recombination propensity but is likely to be a common and potent force acting on the human genome.
