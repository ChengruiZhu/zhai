The world is currently experiencing a rapid loss of species, prompting investigation into the role of biodiversity on the functioning of ecosystems. Many recent studies have shown that high diversity of plants, pollinators, and predators is related to high plant growth, pollination, and predation, respectively. Many of these studies involved controlled experiments, yet results were highly variable, indicating that the environment may affect the relationship between species diversity and these ecosystem functions. In a heterogeneous environment, different species can occupy different microhabitats, or use different resources. This reduces competition between species, and can mean that diverse assemblages perform their ecosystem functions at elevated rates. Here we examine rates of three important functions in different natural, nonexperimental ecosystems: plant biomass production in German grasslands, parasitism rates across five habitat types in coastal Ecuador, and coffee pollination in agroforestry systems in Indonesia. We demonstrate that the effect of diversity on these processes increases in environments where limiting resources (soil nutrients, host insects, and coffee flowers, respectively) are spatially heterogeneous. These real world patterns, combined with previous experiments suggest that biodiversity may have its greatest impact on the functioning of diverse, naturally heterogeneous ecosystems.
