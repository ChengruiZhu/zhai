When a listener is presented with many sound sources at once, it is easier to understand a particular source when it comes from a different spatial location than the other competing sources. However, past studies of auditory cortex generally find that in response to a single sound source, there is not a precise representation of spatial location in the cortex, which makes this effect of spatial location hard to understand. Here, we presented zebra finches with two simultaneous sounds (a birdsong target and a noise masking sound) from distinct spatial locations and recorded neural responses in field L, which is analogous to primary auditory cortex in mammals. When the target sound was presented by itself, the location of the source had little effect on the ability to identify the target song based on neural activity in field L. However, when the target was presented with a masker sound, the location of both sources strongly affected neural discrimination performance. Moreover, different subpopulations of neurons preferentially encoded either target or masker, providing a potential substrate for spatial selective attention. Thus, even though location is not well coded in cortical neurons, spatial information strongly modulates cortical responses.
