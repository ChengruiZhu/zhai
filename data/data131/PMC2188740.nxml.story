T lymphocytes develop in the thymus from immunologically naive bone marrow precursors. Based on T cell receptor rearrangement and transcription, and thymic reconstitution potential, we have deduced a developmental sequence among immature thymocytes, before the acquisition of the lineage markers CD3, CD4, and CD8. In the current study, we have followed the ontogenic progression of the latter stages in this sequence, using two different systems: (a) in vivo, by direct injection into the thymus of nonirradiated, congenic recipients; and (b) in vitro, using culture medium without mitogens or cytokines. In vivo, the less mature Pgp-1- interleukin 2 receptor alpha-positive (IL- 2R alpha+) CD3-4-8- subset (also heat-stable antigen high) requires 3 d before becoming predominantly IL-2R alpha- CD3lo4+ 8+ typical cortical- type cells, and at least 5 d before the appearance of any mature single- positive cells (CD3hi4+ 8- or CD3hi4-8+). However, these Pgp-1- IL-2R alpha+ precursors do not differentiate further in unstimulated culture. The more mature Pgp-1- IL-2R alpha- CD3-4-8- subset becomes primarily CD3lo4+ 8+ within 1 d after transplantation, and some mature single- positive progeny are evident by day 3. By 5 d, most of these Pgp-1-IL- 2R alpha- precursor cells have become CD3hi, and have lost or are downregulating either CD4 or CD8. In culture, these Pgp-1- IL-2R alpha- cells also acquire high levels of CD4 and CD8 within 1 d, and low levels of CD3 by 2 d. However, they do not progress further to mature single positives in vitro, and most of them die by day 3. These experiments directly confirm our previously proposed developmental sequence, and demonstrate the kinetics of T lymphocyte production in a low-stress, steady-state environment.
