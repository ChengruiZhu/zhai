Solvents play a fundamental role in living systems where they mediate the interactions between proteins and other biomolecules. Besides water, biological solvents often contain high concentrations of small molecular compounds known as cosolvents. Although many studies have reported specific and opposite effects of cosolvents on protein-protein interactions, the molecular origins of this phenomenon remain unknown. In this study, we develop a methodology to predict solvent effects on protein-protein interactions by computational characterization of local protein solvation. We use this methodology to explain the opposite effects of glycerol on the binding affinity of two antibodies. Quantitative characterization of local solvation near the protein-protein interface reveals that solvation changes not only depend on the extent of dewetting of the protein-protein contact region, but also on specific protein structural changes at the periphery of the protein-protein interface. Our results demonstrate the direct relationship between solvent effects on protein-protein interactions and local solvent-protein interactions, and establish a general methodology for predicting and understanding cosolvent effects on protein-protein interactions in diverse biological environments.
