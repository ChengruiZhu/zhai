Embryonic development is a highly complex process that requires tight orchestration of cellular proliferation, differentiation, and migration as cells grow within loosely aggregated mesenchyme and more organized epithelial sheets to form organs and tissues. In addition to intrinsic cell-autonomous signals, these events are further regulated by environmental cues provided by neighboring cells. Prior work demonstrated a critical role for the surrounding mesenchyme in guiding epithelial growth during the early stages of pancreas development. However, it remained unclear whether the mesenchyme also guided the later stages of pancreas organogenesis when the functional exocrine and endocrine cells are formed. Here, we show that specific genetic ablation of the mesenchyme at distinct developmental stages in vivo results in the formation of a smaller, misshapen pancreas. Loss of the mesenchyme profoundly impairs the expansion of both endocrine and exocrine pancreatic progenitors, as well as the proliferative capacity of maturing cells, including insulin-producing beta-cells. Thus, our studies reveal unappreciated roles for the mesenchyme in guiding the formation of the epithelial pancreas throughout development. The results suggest that identifying the specific mesenchymal signals might help to optimize cell culture protocols that aim to achieve the differentiation of stem cells into insulin-producing beta cells.
