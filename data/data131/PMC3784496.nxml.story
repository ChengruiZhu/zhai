The large, dsDNA virus Human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) is the most genetically complex viral pathogen of humans. HCMV populations are highly variable, which may allow the virus to evolve in human hosts on short timescales. We tested this hypothesis by longitudinally sampling HCMV populations from the urine and/or plasma of congenitally infected infants. We found that HCMV is generally stable within a compartment, but rapidly evolves when crossing host compartments. In fact, HCMV sampled from two compartments of the same host is as different as HCMV collected from unrelated hosts. We used mathematical modeling and population genetic analysis to show that both a bottleneck (i.e., a reduction in population size) associated with compartment colonization as well as positive selection are necessary to explain the observed differences between compartments. We also conclude from these data that fetal infection in these patients occurred between 13â€“18 weeks gestational age, consistent with the timing of symptomatic congenital HCMV infections. This study is the most detailed investigation of DNA virus evolution in human hosts to date, provides a framework for the study of other viral infections using similar techniques, and will aid in the development of new antiviral therapies and vaccines.
