Initially, 3028 patients were identified to have undergone primary ACL reconstruction in the cohort during the identified time frame, with 2586 patients completing 2-year follow-up (85%). Complete MCL tears were documented in 1.1% (27/2586) of the cohort: 16 operatively managed patients and 11 conservatively treated MCLs during ACL reconstruction. Concurrent articular pathology was similar between groups. Clinically important differences were seen in baseline KOOS (all subscales) and IKDC scores, with lower scores seen in patients who underwent operative MCL treatment. Reoperation for arthrofibrosis was higher after operative repair of the MCL (19%) versus nonoperative treatment (9%). At 2 years the non-operative MCL cohort maintained significantly better KOOS Sports Rec (88.2 versus 74.4), KOOS QOL (81.3 versus 68.4), and IKDC (87.6 versus 76.0) scores compared to the MCL surgery group. Marx activity scores were equal between groups at the time of study enrollment, however patients who underwent operative MCL management had lower activity scores at 2 years (6.5 versus 10.7). Tibial-sided MCL injuries were associated with worse baseline outcomes compared with femoral-sided MCL injuries in terms of KOOS ADL, Sports Rec, and QOL subscales, but these differences were resolved by 2 years. Surgical chronicity did not influence 2-year outcome.
