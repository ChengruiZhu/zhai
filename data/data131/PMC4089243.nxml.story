Surgical procedures involving heart and liver are rare and have been limited to either combined heart and liver transplantation or coronary artery bypass graft surgery (CABG) or aortic valve surgery and orthotopic liver transplantation (OLT). Aortic valve replacement (AVR) and pulmonary valve vegetectomy for bacterial endocarditis after OLT have also been reported. There are only five cases with aortic stenosis and cirrhosis reported to have combined AVR and liver transplantation. In the presence of cirrhosis, AVR has a significant risk for mortality because of bleeding from coagulopathy, renal failure, infection, and poor post-operative wound healing. Herein, we report on a case and management analysis of combined sequential AVR, and OLT in a 40-year-old cirrhotic man with Child and MELD score of C and 29, respectively. Echocardiography detected severe aortic insufficiency (AI) with enlarged left ventricle. Due to severe AI, the cardiologist recommended AVR prior to transplantation. The patient underwent metallic AVR. 4 months later, he received OLT. Both operations were successful and uneventful. Prioritizing AVR before OLT was successful in this patient. However, each patient must be evaluated individually and multiple factors should be assessed in pre-operation evaluation.
