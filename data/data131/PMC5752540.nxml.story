Endometrial cancer arises from the endometrium. It has a slow progression and a reported survival rate of 75%. The identification of soluble biomarkers in the uterine aspirate may be very useful for its early diagnosis. Uterine aspirates from 10 patients with endometrial cancer and 6 non-endometrial cancer controls were analyzed by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis coupled with mass spectrometry and western blotting for data verification. A total of 25 proteins with fold change in %V ≥2 or ≤0.5 in intensity were observed to change significantly (P<0.05). From the discovery phase, four proteins (costars family protein ABRACL, phosphoglycerate mutase 2, fibrinogen beta chain, annexin A3) were found to be present in the uterine aspirate of endometrial cancers and not in healthy aspirates. Western blotting verification data demonstrated that costars family protein ABRACL, phosphoglycerate mutase 2 were present only in endometrial cancer uterine aspirate while fibrinogen beta chain, annexin A3 were also present in healthy aspirates. To our knowledge, phosphoglycerate mutase 2 has not been previously associated with endometrial cancer. In this study we demonstrate that uterine aspirates are a promising biological fluid in which to identify endometrial cancer biomarkers. In our opinion proteins like costars family protein ABRACL and phosphoglycerate mutase 2 have a great potential to reach the clinical phase after a validation phase.
