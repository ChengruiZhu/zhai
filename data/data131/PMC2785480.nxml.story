Protein-protein interaction networks provide a global picture of cellular function and biological processes. The dysfunction of some interactions causes many diseases, including cancer. Proteins interact through their interfaces. Therefore, studying the interface properties of cancer-related proteins will help explain their role in the interaction networks. The structural details of interfaces are immensely useful in efforts to answer some fundamental questions such as: (i) what features of cancer-related protein interfaces make them act as hubs; (ii) how hub protein interfaces can interact with tens of other proteins with varying affinities; and (iii) which interactions can occur simultaneously and which are mutually exclusive. Addressing these questions, we propose a method to characterize interactions in a human protein-protein interaction network using three-dimensional protein structures and interfaces. Protein interface analysis shows that the strength and specificity of the interactions of hub proteins and cancer proteins are different than the interactions of non-hub and non-cancer proteins, respectively. In addition, distinguishing overlapping from non-overlapping interfaces, we illustrate how a fourth dimension, that of the sequence of processes, is integrated into the network with case studies. We believe that such an approach should be useful in structural systems biology.
