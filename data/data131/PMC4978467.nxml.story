Circadian rhythms switch gene expression on and off with a daily rhythm in most tissues in mammals and other animals. Typically, thousands of genes are affected, and the functions of these rhythms include preparing and adjusting various physiological functions in tissues to meet time-of-day dependent requirements optimally. The controllers of the rhythms are often transcription factors (proteins which regulate transcription), which are relatively well known. However, there is a layer between transcription factor action and transcriptional activity whose role in circadian transcription has not previously been characterized: the core promoter. The core promoter acts as a template for the assembly of the intricate machinery that governs initiation of transcription. There are different types of core promoters that are typically used for different types of genes. It is not known which types of core promoters are used for the rhythmically induced genes. Here, it is shown that there are specific characteristics of core promoters driving rhythmic transcription in mice and flies. Furthermore, it is shown that there is a class of strong circadian promoters in mice that drive strong rhythms with very intense average transcriptional rates. These results help understanding the regulatory systems governing circadian transcription, and ultimately, aid the understanding of many diseases resulting from disturbed circadian rhythms.
