Somatic copy number alterations (SCNAs) are essential in oncogensis and progression of a variety of cancers. Accurate identification and quatification of SCNAs are fundamental in the effort of cataloging different variants in cancer genome. This task has its own challenges due to complex nature of tumor SCNA profile and is further complicated by the heterogeneity of the cells collected from a tumor tissue and the contamination from adjacent normal cells, making it difficult for the methods well tailored for the detection of germline copy number variation (CNV) to fit in tumor SCNA detection. Next generation sequencing provides an opportunity to comprehensively characterize SCNA at unprecedent resolution. While total read depth information is commonly used in SCNA detection methods, the allele-specific read depth is less often considered, leading to sub-optimal solution. By incorparating both pieces of information, we developed a segmentation-based pipeline to address aforementioned issues in SCNA detection. This tool is applicable on both deep sequencing data as well as SNP array data and enables accurate and efficient characterization of genome-wide SCNA profile to facilitate large-scale cancer studies.
