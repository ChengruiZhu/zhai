We performed 332 single or multiple myomectomies for symptomatic myomas. Most patients (47%) had more than one myoma, with a maximum of 8 per patient (average myomas removed for patients: 2.23, range 1 to 8). Myoma size ranged from 1cm to 20 cm (mean, 60.20±SD27.1 mm). Myomas <4cm were removed during myomectomy for larger ones. The conversion rate to laparotomy was 1.51%. The average drop in hemoglobin concentration was 1.06±SD0.86 g/100 mL (range, 0.7 to 2.2 g/100 mL). No blood transfusions were required. No major intraoperative complications occurred. The duration of the procedure ranged from 30 minutes to 360 minutes (mean, 124±SD52.6). The dimensions of the myomas removed increased with experience (4.91±SD2.2 cm of the earlier cases to 6.76±SD2.7 of the latest group, P<0.000). The learning curve positively influenced the length of the procedures in the first cases. The introduction of electromechanical morcellation in 1996 reduced the procedure time. Data showed significantly reduced Hb drop after the introduction in 1998 of vasoconstrictive agents (ΔHb 1.62 g/100 mL versus 0.95; P<0.001). The running suture offered few advantages in terms of procedure time. However, the drop in hemoglobin was advantageous (ΔHb 1.1 g/100mL vs 0.61, P<0.01). The overall rate of intrauterine pregnancy following LM was 65.5%. No uterine ruptures occurred. We had 2 serious postoperative complications:
