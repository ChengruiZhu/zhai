 protocol for Th17 differentiation by transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-β) plus IL-6 cytokines, a combination of IL-23 plus IL-6 can also induce Th17 cells. The Th17 cells induced by IL-23 plus IL-6 (termed as effector Th17, Teff17 cells) are pathogenic upon adoptive transfer into non-obese diabetic (NOD) mice contributing to the development of type 1 diabetes (T1D) while cells induced by TGF-β plus IL-6 (termed as regulatory T cells, Treg17 cells) are non pathogenic and regulatory, and suppressed the pathogenic T cells in T1D. These cells differentially expressed a number of cytokines where Teff17 cells exhibited an increase in granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) and IL-22 whereas Treg17 cells demonstrated increased expression of IL-21 and immunosuppressive cytokine IL-10. Differentiation of Th17 cells is controlled by a transcription factor, RORγT although these cells also express variable levels of T-bet and FoxP3 transcription factors. This points to a dual functional role of Th17 subsets in autoimmune diseases particularly T1D. We suggest that similar to conventional regulatory T cells (Treg), induction of regulatory Treg17 cells could play an important role in modulating and preventing certain autoimmune diseases.
