To cope with the accumulation of unfolded or misfolded proteins the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) has evolved specific signalling pathways collectively called the unfolded protein response (UPR). Elucidation of the mechanisms governing ER stress signallinghas linked this response to the regulation of diverse physiologic processes as well as to the progression of a number of diseases. Interest in hereditary haemochromatosis (HH) has focused on the study of proteins implicated in iron homeostasis and on the identification of new alleles related with the disease. HFE has been amongst the preferred targets of interest, since the discovery that its C282Y mutation was associated with HH. However, the discrepancies between the disease penetrance and the frequency of this mutation have raised the possibility that its contribution to disease progression might go beyond the mere involvement in regulation of cellular iron uptake. Recent findings revealed that activation of the UPR is a feature of HH and that this stress response may be involved in the genesis of immunological anomalies associated with the disease. This review addresses the connection of the UPR with HH, including its role in MHC-I antigen presentation pathway and possible implications for new clinical approaches to HH.
