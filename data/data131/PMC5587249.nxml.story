The following biomechanical parameters of 48 keratoconic eyes were compared with the corresponding ones in 50 normal eyes: time of the first applanation and time from start to the second applanation [applanation-1 time (A1T) and applanation-2 time (A2T)], time of the highest corneal displacement [highest concavity time (HCT)], magnitude of the displacement [highest concavity deformation amplitude (HCDA)], the length of the flattened segment in the applanations [first applanation length (A1L) and second applanation length (A2L)], velocity of corneal movement during applanations [applanation-1 velocity (A1V) and applanation-2 velocity (A2V)], distance between bending points of the cornea at the highest concavity [highest concavity peak distance (HCPD)], central concave curvature at the highest concavity [highest concavity radius (HCR)]. To assess the change of parameters by disease severity, the keratoconus group was divided into two subgroups, and their biomechanical parameters were compared with each other and with normal group. The parameters' predictive ability was assessed by receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves. To control the effect of central corneal thickness (CCT) difference between the two groups, two subgroups with similar CCT were selected, and the analyses were repeated.
