Although regulated suppression of the immune system prevents autoimmunity and is important during pregnancy to protect the fetus or after organ transplant to block graft rejection, it can be harmful if co-opted by tumors to escape detection. T cells of the immune system normally recognize and destroy abnormal cells, including cancerous and grafted tissues. This process requires the amino acid tryptophan. Foreign grafts and cancer cells can dampen the immune response by starving T cells of tryptophan through a mechanism involving uptake and conversion to kynurenines using an enzyme called indoleamine-2,3-dioxygenase (IDO). Independent of tryptophan starvation, kynurenines induce T cell death when they are excreted through an unknown mechanism. We constructed fluorescent nanosensors that report tryptophan levels in two immortalized cell lines, COS-7 cells and human oral cancer KB cells. Using single-cell, real-time imaging analysis, we demonstrate that an L-amino acid transporter protein (LAT1) exchanges tryptophan for its kynurenine degradation products. LAT1 together with IDO forms a metabolic minicycle that couples tryptophan starvation with kynurenine-induced cell death, providing a two-pronged inactivation of neighboring cells. The strict coupling protects the cells that overproduce IDO from accumulating kynurenine. This cycle may contribute to suppression of the immune response in autoimmune diseases and cancer.
