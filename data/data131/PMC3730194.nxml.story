Adenomyosis, also known as endometriosis interna, is the presence of endometrial glands and stroma within the myometrium. Its localised form is called adenomyoma and mimics a leiomyoma. Rarely, adenomyomas are located outside the uterus and some of them form uterus-like masses with a thick muscle wall and an endometrium-lined central cavity. They are generally located in the ovary or broad ligament, and, although they are closely related to endometriosis, their pathogenetic mechanisms are different from each other. MÃ¼llerian duct fusion defect and subcoelomic mesenchyme transformation theory are two possible pathogenetic mechanisms for this rare entity. Here we report abscessed uterine and extrauterine adenomyomas forming uterus-like masses in the left and right broad ligament and an ectopic adrenal tissue in the left paraovarian region in a 56-year-old woman. Although there is a reported abscessed adenomyosis in the literature, this is the first abscessed extrauterine uterus-like masses with synchronous pelvic pathologies like endometriosis, leiomyomas, adenomyosis, an endometrial polyp, an endocervical polyp, and an ectopic adrenal tissue. This benign lesion gives the impression of leiomyoma, a uterine malformation, or even malignancy preoperatively. Frozen section helps in differential diagnosis.
