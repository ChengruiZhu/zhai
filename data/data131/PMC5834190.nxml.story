Public health agencies such as the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention would like to have as much information as possible when planning interventions intended to reduce and prevent the spread of infectious disease. For instance, accurate and reliable predictions of the timing and severity of the influenza season could help with planning how many influenza vaccine doses to produce and by what date they will be needed. Many different mathematical and statistical models have been proposed to model influenza and other infectious diseases, and these models have different strengths and weaknesses. In particular, one or another of these model specifications is often better than the others in different seasons, at different times within the season, and for different prediction targets (such as different measures of the timing or severity of the influenza season). In this article, we explore ensemble methods that combine predictions from multiple “component” models. We find that these ensemble methods do about as well as the best of the component models in terms of aggregate performance across multiple seasons, but that the ensemble methods have more consistent performance across different seasons. This improved consistency is valuable for planners who need predictions that can be trusted under all circumstances.
