Environmental Public Health Tracking (EPHT) staff at the state and national levels are developing nationally consistent data and methods to estimate the impact of ozone and fine particulate matter on hospitalizations for asthma and myocardial infarction. Pilot projects have demonstrated the feasibility of pooling state hospitalization data and linking these data to The United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) statistically based ambient air estimates for ozone and fine particulates. Tools were developed to perform case-crossover analyses to estimate concentrationâ€“response (C-R) functions. A weakness of analyzing one state at a time is that the effects are relatively small compared to their confidence intervals. The EPHT program will explore ways to statistically combine the results of peer-reviewed analyses from across the country to provide more robust C-R functions and health impact estimates at the local level. One challenge will be to routinely share data for these types of analyses at fine geographic and temporal scales without disclosing confidential information. Another challenge will be to develop C-R estimates which take into account time, space, or other relevant effect modifiers.
