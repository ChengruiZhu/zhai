The damped harmonic oscillator framework has been applied to interrogate numerous engineering systems like the tuned mass damper used in power transmission, automobiles, and buildings to reduce vibrations. We apply the same framework to undulatory swimming to understand the emergence of movement due to muscular and/or environmental forcing. It helps elucidate why flexible bodies can indeed be propelled forward by not only the internal muscular forcing but also by external fluid forces as reported earlier in which dead trout were found to swim in the wake of cylinder. We show how forcing triggers the first few deformation modes of the swimmer similar to how the appropriate forcing triggers the fundamental deformation modes on a guitar string. We show how the lower deformation modes produce the best forward propulsion of the body. This insight reveals that swimming is viable for small enough frequencies of neuromuscular activation relative to the natural frequencies of the body and for sufficiently stiff elastic properties. Thus, these results identify the key mechanistic parameters that would have been crucial to the evolutionary emergence of swimming animals. The proposed framework can help understand neural control of movement in swimming as well as control of underwater vehicles.
