We present a case of a 55-year-old female with a history of hypertension who presented to the emergency department with intermittent chest discomfort for three days. Laboratory results showed an elevated troponin of 0.18 ng/ml and subsequently increased to 0.39 ng/ml. The initial electrocardiogram study demonstrated sinus tachycardia with no acute changes. The patient was diagnosed with non-ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction. She underwent cardiac catheterization that showed 90% stenosis of the left main/left anterior descending artery. Reflux of contrast from the right coronary artery (RCA) ostium to the pulmonary artery was seen along with left to right collaterals with retrograde filling of the RCA. There was no significant obstruction of the RCA when viewed via left to right collaterals. Right heart catheterization and pulmonary angiography were performed which confirmed the origin of the RCA from the pulmonary trunk. The patient was referred for surgery and ligation of the aberrant RCA originating from the pulmonary artery was performed along with coronary artery bypass grafting x 2, left internal mammary artery to left anterior descending artery (LAD) and saphenous vein graft to the proximal posterior descending artery. The patient was discharged home with marked improvement of her symptoms.
