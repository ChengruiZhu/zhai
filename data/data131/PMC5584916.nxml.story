Endometriosis is an inflammatory pathology associated with a negative effect on life quality. Recently, this pathology was connected to ovarian cancer, in particular with endometrioid ovarian cancer. microRNAs (miRNAs) are a class of RNA transcripts ~19â€“22 nucleotides in length, the altered miRNA pattern being connected to pathological status. miRNAs are highly stable transcripts, and these can be assessed from formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) samples leading to the identification of miRNAs that could be developed as diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers, in particular those involved in malignant transformation. The aim of our study was to evaluate miRNA expression pattern in FFPE samples from endometriosis and ovarian cancer patients using PCR-array technology and also to compare the differential expression pattern in ovarian cancer versus endometriosis. For the PCR-array study, we have used nine macrodissected FFPE samples from endometriosis tissue, eight samples of ovarian cancers and five normal ovarian tissues. Quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) was used for data validation in a new patient cohort of 17 normal samples, 33 endometriosis samples and 28 ovarian cancer macrodissected FFPE samples. Considering 1.5-fold expression difference as a cut-off level and a
