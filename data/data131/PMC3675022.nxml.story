Meiosis is a special cell division that generates genetically divergent haploid germ cells. At the very beginning of this process, during meiotic prophase, the enzyme SPO11 generates hundreds of DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs). Meiotic DSBs are repaired via a mechanism that requires the presence of an intact homologous template. This repair process stimulates homologous chromosome pairing, and the formation of a protein complex that connects the paired chromosome axes, reaching a state called synapsis. Male mammals carry a pair of largely heterologous sex chromosomes, the X and Y, which show delayed DSB repair and extensive asynapsis. In addition, the X and Y chromosomes are transcriptionally silenced by a mechanism named Meiotic Sex Chromosome Inactivation (MSCI). This mechanism is a specialization of a more general silencing mechanism, named Meiotic Silencing of Unsynapsed Chromatin (MSUC), that is induced when any pairing problem between homologous chromosomes results in asynapsis, in male as well as female meiotic prophase cells. Here, we demonstrate that in addition to asynapsis, the persistent presence of DNA repair foci is a hallmark of meiotic silencing. In addition, we show that SPO11-independent DNA repair foci form during normal oocyte development. We propose that these foci represent sites of unrepaired DSBs that are capable of inducing transcriptional silencing, irrespective of synapsis.
