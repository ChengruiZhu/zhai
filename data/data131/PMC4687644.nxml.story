Human inherited photoreceptor degenerations (IPDs) are genetically heterogeneous and exhibit significant unexplained phenotypic variability. Mutation of hundreds of known genes can cause these disorders, but variability still occurs among individuals with mutations in the same gene. Possible explanations include environmental factors, mutation-specific effects, and sequence variants of modifier genes that influence the impact of disease-causing mutations. We have identified a modifier locus associated with profound suppression of photoreceptor degeneration in a mouse model of a human IPD. A gene similar to the IPD gene lies within the modifier locus, and the protein encoded by this putative modifier gene seems to substitute for the IPD protein. Our results link modest variation in the quantity of the modifier transcript, and a consequent change in the quantity of the protein, with variation in degeneration severity. Many common human genetic variants cause differences in the transcript levels of individual genes, but a significant fraction of such variants manifest only in subsets of tissues, and ocular tissues have not been surveyed. Our work suggests that variation in the transcript levels of modifier genes may contribute to variability in human IPDs, and that the retina should be assessed for genetic variants that affect gene expression.
