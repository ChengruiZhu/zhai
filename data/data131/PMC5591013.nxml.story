Emerging pathogens are an increasing threat to human, animal, and plant health. In areas where these pathogens have not yet become established, surveillance is needed to detect incursions early enough to implement control measures. However, most epidemiological systems are heterogeneous in nature, and it is unclear how finite surveillance resources should be divided between constituent groups (such as hosts and vectors in the case of vector-borne pathogens). We use mathematical and statistical methods to address this issue. Taking the example of vector-borne pathogens, we show how to estimate the proportion of infected hosts or vectors at the time of first detection for any combination of host and vector sampling rates, given some knowledge of the characteristics of pathogen spread within and between hosts and vectors. We predict that the required total sampling effort and cost for early detection will be lowest when either hosts or vectors are sampled, with the optimal group to sample being the one with the highest estimated prevalence during initial exponential growth (which has clear parallels with ‘targeted surveillance’). We demonstrate the use of our framework by applying it to two vector-borne diseases of citrus and evaluate its predictions using a simple simulation model of sampling.
