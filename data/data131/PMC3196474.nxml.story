Meiosis is the process of cell division that reduces the number of chromosome sets from two to one, so producing gametes for sexual reproduction. During meiosis in many organisms, there is reciprocal exchange of genetic material between homologous chromosomes by the formation of “crossovers,” which promote genetic diversity by creating new combinations of gene variants and play an important mechanical role in the segregation of chromosomes. Crossovers do not occur randomly throughout the genome, but in small regions called hotspots. Recent work showed that hotspots have specific structural features and that the protein PRDM9 is important in specifying their location. PRDM9 contains a so-called zinc finger domain that is predicted to bind specific DNA sequences, suggesting that hotspots might be sites where PRDM9 binds. By using transgenic mice expressing PRDM9 with modified zinc fingers, here we show directly that the nature of the zinc fingers in PRDM9 determines crossover hotspot localization. We show that PRDM9 binds DNA sequences at the center of hotspots. Furthermore, we identify DNA sequence polymorphisms that affect its binding and the extent of crossover activity. Overall, our work shows that PRDM9, through its zinc finger domain, is a master regulator of hotspot location in the mouse genome.
