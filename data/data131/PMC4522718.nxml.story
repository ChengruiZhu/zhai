) plants under drought stress. A total of 56,354 and 49,308 reads were generated from leaf and root tissues, respectively, and clustered into 6,313 and 5,858 unigenes. The differentially expressed unigenes that showed up-regulation (≥2-fold) or down-regulation (2≤-fold) were considered for further analysis. A total of 3,517 unigenes were differentially expressed in both tissues. The 1,528 genes specific to leaves and 1,128 specific to roots were obtained. The 28 biological pathways in two tissues were found to respond significantly to drought stress. A total of 289 in leaf and 277 in root unknown (novel) unigenes were found to be remarkably regulated by drought stress. Some key regulatory genes involved in abiotic stress such as WRKY, ERF, AP2 EREBP, MYB, and LEA were highly expressed in leaves. The genes RHD3, LBD, and transcription factor WRKY75, known for root development under various stress conditions, were expressed specifically in root. The genes related to chlorophyll a/b binding protein and photosystem-related proteins showed significant higher expression in roots and as compared to leaves. It can be concluded that cotton leaves are distinct from roots in terms of molecular mechanisms for responses to drought stress.
