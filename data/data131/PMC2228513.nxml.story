Substances known to alter cyclic nucleotide levels in cells were applied to the isolated toad retina and effects on rod electrical and adaptive behavior were studied. The retina was continually superfused in control ringer’s or ringer’s containing one or a combination of drugs, and rod activity was recorded intracellularly. Superfusion with cGMP, Bu(2)GMP, isobutylmethylxanthine (IBMX; a phosphodiesterase inhibitor), or PGF(2α) (a prostaglandin) caused effects in rods that closely match those observed when extracellular Ca(2+) levels were lowered. For example, short exposures (up to 6 min) of the retina to these substances caused depolarization of the membrane potential, increase in response amplitudes, and some changes in waveform; but under dark-adapted or partially light-adapted conditions receptor sensitivity was virtually unaffected. That is, the position of the V-log I curve on the intensity axis was determined by the prevailing light level, not by drug level. These drugs, like lowered extracellular Ca(2+), also decreased the period of receptor saturation after a bright-adapting flash, resulting in an acceleration of the onset of membrane and sensitivity recovery during dark adaptation.
