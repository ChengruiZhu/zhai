Cardiovascular diseases (atherosclerosis, stroke, myocardiac infarction etc.) are the major systemic diseases of elder peoples in the world. This is possibly due to increased levels of oxidized low-density lipoproteins (oxLDLs) such as 7-ketocholesterol (7-KC) and lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC) that damage vascular endothelial cells, induce inflammatory responses, to elevate the risk of cardiovascular diseases, Alzheimer's disease, and age-related macular degeneration. However the toxic effects of 7-KC on endothelial cells are not known. In this study, 7-KC showed cytotoxicity to endothelial cells at concentrations higher than 10 Î¼g/ml. 7-KC stimulated ATM/Chk2, ATR-Chk1 and p53 signaling pathways in endothelial cells. 7-KC also induced G0/G1 cell cycle arrest and apoptosis with an inhibition of Cyclin dependent kinase 1 (Cdk1) and cyclin B1 expression. Secretion and expression of IL-8 in endothelial cells were stimulated by 7-KC. 7-KC further induced intracellular ROS production as shown by increase in DCF fluorescence and Akt phosphorylation. LY294002 attenuated the 7-KC-induced apoptosis and IL-8 mRNA expression of endothelial cells. These results indicate that oxLDLs such as 7-KC may contribute to the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis, thrombosis and cardiovascular diseases by induction of endothelial damage, apoptosis and inflammatory responses. These events are associated with ROS production, activation of ATM/Chk2, ATR/Chk1, p53 and PI3K/Akt signaling pathways.
