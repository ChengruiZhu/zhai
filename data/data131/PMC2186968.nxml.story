Culture of human peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBL) in partially purified and lectin-free interleukin 2 results in the generation of cytotoxic effector cells which have the unique property of lysing natural killer (NK)-resistant fresh human tumor cells. We have termed these effector cells “lymphokine- activated killer” cells (LAK). LAK are generated from both normal and cancer patients' PBL and are able to lyse both autologous and allogeneic tumor cells from all histologic tumor types tested. Our previous studies suggested that the LAK phenomenon was distinct from either the cytotoxic thymus-derived lymphocyte (CTL) or NK systems based on a variety of criteria. This study reports that the cell type involved is also distinct, as determined by phenotypic characteristics. The LAK effector cell phenotype was analyzed in parallel with alloimmune CTL, and LAK were found to be similarly susceptible to the monoclonal anti-T cell antibodies OKT-3 or OKT-8 plus complement. In contrast the LAK precursor was not susceptible to the OKT-3 or Leu-1 antibodies plus complement, while the ability to generate alloimmune CTL was totally obliterated when tested using the same PBL responder population; in fact, generation of LAK was found to be augmented five- to sixfold, clearly suggesting that LAK precursor cells are not T lymphocytes as defined by these antibodies. LAK precursors were found to be abundant in NK cell-enriched Percoll gradient fractions, which had been depleted of the 29 degrees C E- rosetting “high affinity” T cells. However, LAK precursors were found to be distinct from the majority of NK cells since lysis of fresh PBL with the monoclonal antibodies OKM-1, Leu-7, or OKT-11 significantly depleted or totally eliminated NK activity, while subsequent activation of the remaining cells generated high levels of LAK and in some cases augmented levels of LAK. LAK precursors were found to be distributed in the thymus, bone marrow, spleen, lymph node, and thoracic duct in addition to the PBL. Therefore, while the cell(s) responsible for activation and expression of LAK activity have some common features with the classic T cell-mediated CTL and NK cell systems, the LAK precursor cells are clearly distinct as determined by phenotype analysis using monoclonal antibodies and complement, and at present must be classified as a “null” cell.
