We report a rare case with histologically proven melanocytoma of the iris that demonstrated diffuse melanocytic proliferation with uncontrolled secondary glaucoma and investigate the etiology of the intraocular pressure elevation. The patient was a 78-year-old man with a history of darkened iris of his left eye. The intraocular pressure was 39 mm Hg. A slit-lamp examination showed a diffuse darkened iris, and a gonioscopic examination revealed open angle with circumferential heavy pigmentation. There was no pigment dispersion of the anterior chamber and no pigment deposition of the cornea. We suspected malignant ring melanoma in the left eye and enucleated it. The globe was examined with light and electron microscopy. Light microscopy revealed the presence of heavily pigmented tumor cells in the iris, ciliary body, trabecular meshwork, and Schlemm's canal. A bleached preparation showed large tumor cells with central and paracentral nuclei without mitosis. Electron microscopy of the trabecular meshwork revealed melanin-bearing tumor cells invading the intertrabecular spaces, and the melanin granules were not phagocytosed in the trabecular cells. The mechanical obstruction of the aqueous flow by the tumor cells may be a major cause of secondary glaucoma in eyes with iris melanocytoma presenting diffuse proliferation.
