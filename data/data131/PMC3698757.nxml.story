We measured arterial blood pressure (BP) in SHRcp by radiotelemetry combined with spectral analysis using a fast Fourier transformation algorithm and examined the effect of azilsartan, an AT1 receptor blocker. Compared with control Wistar‐Kyoto rats (WKY) and SHR, SHRcp exhibited a nondipper‐type hypertension and displayed increased urinary norepinephrine excretion and increased urinary and plasma aldosterone levels. Compared with WKY and SHR, SHRcp were characterized by an increase in the low‐frequency power (LF) of systolic BP and a decrease in spontaneous baroreflex gain (sBRG), indicating autonomic dysfunction. Thus, SHRcp are regarded as a useful model of human hypertension with metabolic syndrome. Oral administration of azilsartan once daily persistently lowered BP during the light period (inactive phase) and the dark period (active phase) in SHRcp more than in WKY and SHR. Thus, angiotensin II seems to be involved in the mechanism of disrupted diurnal BP rhythm in SHRcp. Azilsartan significantly reduced urinary norepinephrine and aldosterone excretion and significantly increased urinary sodium excretion in SHRcp. Furthermore, azilsartan significantly reduced LF of systolic BP and significantly increased sBRG in SHRcp.
