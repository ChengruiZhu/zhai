Computer simulation plays an important role to understand molecular systems and has been applied to problems of increasing complexity. Multistate equilibrium is a fundamental concept behind the structure and function of biological systems. Due to the limit in computing resources and lack of good alternative methods, computer simulation has been conducted for systems in a single state, sampling from one state to another to infer equilibrium properties. This sequential approach has been successful in many cases such as protonation equilibrium with implicit solvation model. However, state transition is difficult when explicit solvent is used for more accurate solvation description. Many efforts have been dedicated to overcome this difficulty. Analogous to real multistate systems, we proposed a virtual mixture of multiple states (VMMS) to directly simulate the equilibrium. State transitions are replaced by changes in state molar fractions. Mimicking a test tube environment, all states are simulated in parallel to equilibrate with each other. Application to constant pH simulation in explicit water demonstrates the capability of this method. It is expected that the VMMS method will find more applications in biological problems related to the equilibrium of competing states.
