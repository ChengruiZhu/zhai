Previously, we prepared a pirarubicin (THP)-encapsulated micellar drug using styrene–maleic acid copolymer (SMA) as the drug carrier, in which active THP was non-covalently encapsulated. We have now developed covalently conjugated SMA-THP (SMA-THP conjugate) for further investigation toward clinical development, because covalently linked polymer–drug conjugates are known to be more stable in circulation than drug-encapsulated micelles. The SMA-THP conjugate also formed micelles and showed albumin binding capacity in aqueous solution, which suggested that this conjugate behaved as a macromolecule during blood circulation. Consequently, SMA-THP conjugate showed significantly prolonged circulation time compared to free THP and high tumor-targeting efficiency by the enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect. As a result, remarkable antitumor effect was achieved against two types of tumors in mice without apparent adverse effects. Significantly, metastatic lung tumor also showed the EPR effect, and this conjugate reduced metastatic tumor in the lung almost completely at 30 mg/kg once i.v. (less than one-fifth of the maximum tolerable dose). Although SMA-THP conjugate per se has little cytotoxicity
