A 58-year-old woman with a history of childhood acute rheumatic fever and resultant mitral valve stenosis was admitted to our cardiovascular surgery clinic complaining of tachycardia, dyspnea, and chest pain. After clinical and radiological findings were evaluated, mitral valve replacement, tricuspid De Vega annuloplasty and plication, and resection of giant left atrium were performed. Atrial thrombus was removed from the top of the left atrial wall. Operation material considered as thrombus was sent to a pathology laboratory for histopathological examination. It was diagnosed with mesothelial/monocytic incidental cardiac lesion (cardiac MICE). Microscopic sections revealed that morphological features of the lesion were different from thrombus. The lesion was composed of a cluster of histiocytoid cells with abundant cytoplasm and oval shaped nuclei and epithelial-like cells resembling mesothelial cells within a fibrin network. Epithelial-like cells formed a papillary configuration in the focal areas. Mitotic figures were absent. Here we present a case which was incidentally found in a patient who underwent mitral valve replacement surgery, as a thrombotic lesion on the left atrium wall.
