Increasing temperature (4-22 degrees C) increases the Ca2+ concentration required for activation of mechanically skinned frog muscle fibers. The pCa required for 50% maximal force (pCa50) was inversely proportional to absolute temperature. Assuming that relative force is directly related to fractional occupancy of the Ca2+-binding sites on troponin that regulate force, the shift was consistent with a Gibbs free energy change of binding (delta G) of about -7.8 kcal/mol. This is close to the delta G for Ca2+ binding to the calcium-specific sites on troponin C reported by others. Decreasing Mg2+ from 1 mM to 60 microM shifts the force-pCa curves at either 4 or 22 degrees C to higher pCa, but the shift of pCa50 with temperature over this range (0.4 log units) was the same at low and high Mg2+. Maximal force increased with temperature for the entire range 4-22 degrees C with a Q10 of 1.41, and over the restricted range 4-15 degrees C with a Q10 of 1.20. From the dual effects of temperature on Ca2+ activation and maximal force, one would expect that force would respond differently to temperature change at high or low Ca2+. At high Ca2+, a temperature increase will lead to an increased force. However, at low to intermediate Ca2+ levels (below the intersection of the force-pCa curves for the initial and final temperatures), steady state force should decrease with increasing temperature. The inverse responses should occur with a decrease in temperature. These responses are observed when temperature is changed by rapid solution exchange.
