It is unclear how shadows are processed in the visual system. Whilst shadows are clearly used as an important cue to localise the objects that cast them, there is mixed evidence regarding the extent to which shadows influence the recognition of those objects. Furthermore experiments exploring the perception of shadows per se have provided evidence that the visual system has less efficient access to the detailed form of a region if it is interpreted as a shadow. The current study sought to clarify our understanding of the manner in which shadows are represented by the visual system by exploring how they influence attention in two different object-based attention paradigms. The results provide evidence that cues to interpret a region as a shadow do not reduce the extent to which that region will result in a within-‘object’ processing advantage. Thus, whilst there is evidence that shadows are processed differently at higher stages of object perception, the present result shows that they are still represented as distinctly segmented regions as far as the allocation of attention is concerned. This result is consistent with the idea that object-based attention phenomena result from region-based scene segmentation rather than from the representations of objects per se.
