While most genome-wide association studies (GWAS) focus on the identification of susceptibility loci for a specific disease, this hypothesis-free approach also enables the identification of unexpected associations between different diseases by taking advantage of the previously published GWAS associations. Androgenetic Alopecia (AGA, also known as male pattern baldness) is the most common type of hair loss in humans. Parkinson's disease is reported to occur more commonly in men than in women; however, there are no studies investigating the link between AGA and Parkinson's disease. Here, we show that a specific genetic locus, chromosome 17q21.31, which is associated with Parkinson's disease, is also a susceptibility locus for early-onset AGA. We further investigate the association between early-onset AGA and Parkinson's disease, irrespective of genotype, directly in a large-scale web-based study. We find that men with early-onset AGA have 28% higher risk of developing Parkinson's disease. The early-onset AGA locus on chromosome 17q21.31 has also been linked to decreased fertility previously. Future studies of this locus may implicate novel biological pathways affecting these three conditions.
