To the authorsâ€™ knowledge this is the first trans-border regional network established to enhance cross border epidemiologic information exchange and surveillance using One Health concepts in North America. Despite the large disparities between health systems, cultures, languages, socioeconomics, politics, animal management strategies, industries and ecosystems in the CA/BC border region, professionals from diverse disciplines are dedicated to OBOH and to the creation of a sustainable integrated surveillance system. OBOH is building the infrastructure for an early warning system in the border region, while improving regional infectious disease surveillance capacity and educating a new cadre of students and professionals about the importance of a One Health approach. Challenges include identifying cross-sectoral/multi-disciplinary funding opportunities to support activities, systematically operationalizing One Health without such funding, identifying and involving partners from different sectors, promoting data exchange, and maintaining an equal understanding of One Health surveillance within the initiative as membership increases. This demonstration provides recommendations on how to initiate and sustain cross-border, multidisciplinary, cross-sectoral surveillance engagements in resource-constrained environments.
