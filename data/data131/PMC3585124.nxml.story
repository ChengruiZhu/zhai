DNA double-strand break (DSB) repair plays a critical role in the maintenance of genome stability, and mutations in key regulators in the DSB repair pathway are often associated with cancers and human diseases exhibiting chromosomal aberrations. CtIP is an essential DNA repair factor participating in homologous recombination (HR)â€“mediated DSB repair. In this study, we found that phosphorylation of CtIP by cell-cycle-dependent kinases CDKs modulates CtIP interaction with Nbs1, a component of the Mre11-Rad50-Nbs1 complex that is associated with Nijmegen breakage syndrome (NBS). We also showed that CtIP is phosphorylated by ataxia-telangiectasia gene product ATM, a kinase critical for the activation of DNA damage response pathway. Importantly, we found that CDK-mediated phosphorylation of CtIP is a prerequisite for CtIP to be phosphorylated by ATM upon DNA damage. These findings reveal a novel mechanism of how cell-cycle-dependent activities regulate HR in response to DNA damage, which significantly helps in understanding the regulation of DSB repair in mammalian cells. This study also provides new insight as to how the DNA damage checkpoint and repair proteins that are associated with human diseases participate in the maintenance of genome stability to prevent cancer.
