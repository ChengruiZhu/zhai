Population ecology and evolutionary biology have been traditionally studied as separate disciplines, even if feedbacks between community and evolutionary processes are known to exist, having been empirically characterized in recent years in different types of communities (from microbes to plants and vertebrates), and theoretically analyzed with novel and powerful mathematical tools. Recent long-term field experiments with plants have proven that rapid co-evolution and diversification of species traits results in an overall enhancement of the ecosystem productivity, with important consequences for agriculture and conservation. Here, we propose a relatively simple computational eco-evolutionary model specifically devised to describe rapid phenotypic diversification in this type of species-rich communities. Our model captures the main phenomenology observed experimentally, and it also makes non-trivial predictions for long term phenotypic change and ecological interactions, such as the stable coexistence of highly specialized species or the possible emergence of phenotypically equivalent species occupying the same niche. Finally, the model is easily generalizable to analyze different eco-evolutionary problems within a relatively simple and unified computational framework.
