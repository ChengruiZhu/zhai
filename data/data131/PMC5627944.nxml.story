The brain processes information by building and adjusting neural connections, and as an organism learns about the environment, it incorporates associations between features of the environment into these adjustable connections. Organisms, however, are not born with these connections; synapses must develop from a connectionless set of neurons. An important aspect of normal brain development is the timely development of the brain and of hierarchically arranged brain regions. In this paper, we show that an unsupervised algorithm, called adaptive synaptogenesis, builds neurons with stable connections and allows these neurons to appropriately discriminate patterns. Here, we show that larger rates of synaptogenesis and synaptic modification speed up development of stable connections. However, such a speed-up produces larger, steady-state energy-costs. We conjecture that these synaptic modification rates have evolved as a compromise via natural selection. In this regard, the evolution-theoretic idea of parent-offspring conflict arises as a developmental consideration; that is, time to stable connectivity must balance with subsequent neural performance. Importantly, we illustrate that the widely-observed phenomenon of synapse overproduction during development can be understood as a compromise between speedy and efficient development.
