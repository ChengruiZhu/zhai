National Health Service Quality Improvement Scotland (NHS QIS) published a health technology scoping report in 2006 acknowledging that there are serious concerns within Scotland in relation to Developmental Dysplasia of Hip (DDH) as there is no formal screening program in place and there are significant variations between NHS boards leading to confusion for staff and parents. NHS QIS identified need for audit work to improve hip screening in Scotland. The aim of this study is review of current practice of selective screening for DDH. All newborns who had their first hip scan during one year period (2014) were included in this retrospective study and followed up until June 2015 to include any surgical intervention for dysplastic hip. Out of 428 babies (856 hip scans), abnormality was seen in 119 babies/147 hips (134 Graf 2a/2b, 10 hips were 2c and 3 hips were Graf grade 3). Average age when first scan was performed was 5 weeks (range 3 weeks to 22 weeks). Analysis of risk factors in 119 babies with abnormal scan was consistent with literature (83 breech, 12 family history, 12 HBW, 10 instability and 2 twins of breech). Twelve babies (16 hips) required treatment and were successfully treated in Pavlik harness. There was one case of missed/late dislocation, which lived in outside catchment area for 3 years since birth. During this study period there was no case of avascular necrosis or femoral nerve palsy as a result of treatment. In our experience, selective hip screening by ultrasound scan is useful in avoiding overtreatment and minimizing late presentations.
