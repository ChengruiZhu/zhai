. Patients have received ART for a median of 7 years and viral replication was fully suppressed for a median of 3 years. Before the switch, 39% patients were treated with NNRTI, 52% with protease inhibitor and 7% with integrase inhibitor-based regimens. Reasons for switch were simplification (176 cases), adverse events (AEs) (93 cases) and others (12 cases). At month 12 (database frozen on June 2014) in the snapshot analysis, 56% of patients met virologic success, 5% experienced virologic failure (n=14) and 39% had no data in the window period. In the LOCF analysis (using data from the previous available visit before month 12), 89% patients were suppressed, 5% had virologic failure and 6% had no data. Genotypic resistance analysis was performed in 7/14 patients at the time of virologic failure (3 of whom had previous NRTI/NNRTI resistance-associated mutations (RAMs)), and new NNRTI and NRTI RAMs emerged in 4 patients. RPV-based regimen was generally well tolerated and only 6% of patients discontinued treatment for AEs. Grade 2–4 treatment-related AEs occurred in 39 patients: 6 had rashes, 13 neuropsychiatric symptoms, 10 GI symptoms, 10 biological abnormalities. At month 12, significant changes from baseline were seen for total and LDL cholesterol (−0.5 and −0.28 mmol/L, respectively, p<0.05 for both), and plasma creatinine (+5.8 µmol/L, p<10–4).
