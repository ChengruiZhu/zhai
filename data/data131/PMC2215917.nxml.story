To examine whether Cl-coupled HCO3 transport mechanisms were present on the basolateral membrane of the mammalian proximal tubule, cell pH was measured in the microperfused rat proximal convoluted tubule using the pH-sensitive, intracellularly trapped fluorescent dye (2',7')- bis(carboxyethyl)-(5,6)-carboxyfluorescein. Increasing the peritubular Cl concentration from 0 to 128.6 meq/liter caused cell pH to decrease from 7.34 +/- 0.04 to 7.21 +/- 0.04 (p less than 0.001). With more acid extracellular fluid (pH 6.62), a similar increase in the peritubular Cl concentration caused cell pH to decrease by a similar amount from 6.97 +/- 0.04 to 6.84 +/- 0.05 (p less than 0.001). This effect was blocked by 1 mM SITS. To examine the Na dependence of Cl/HCO3 exchange, the above studies were repeated in the absence of luminal and peritubular Na. In alkaline Na-free solutions, peritubular Cl addition caused cell pH to decrease from 7.57 +/- 0.06 to 7.53 +/- 0.06 (p less than 0.025); in acid Na-free solutions, peritubular Cl addition caused cell pH to decrease from 7.21 +/- 0.04 to 7.19 +/- 0.04 (p less than 0.05). The effect of Cl on cell pH was smaller in the absence of luminal and peritubular Na than in its presence. To examine whether the previously described Na/(HCO3)n greater than 1 cotransporter was coupled to or dependent on Cl, the effect of lowering the peritubular Na concentration from 147 to 25 meq/liter was examined in the absence of ambient Cl. Cell pH decreased from 7.28 +/- 0.03 to 7.08 +/- 0.03, a response similar to that observed previously in the presence of Cl. The results demonstrate that Cl/HCO3 (or Cl/OH) exchange is present on the basolateral membrane. Most of Cl/HCO3 exchange is dependent on the presence of Na and may be coupled to it. The previously described Na/(HCO3)n greater than 1 cotransporter is the major basolateral membrane pathway for the coupling of Na and HCO3 and is not coupled to Cl.
