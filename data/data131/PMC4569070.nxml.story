Fibrinogen, a protein found in the blood of vertebrates, when activated, aggregates and forms fibrin fibers, the basis of a blood clot. Clots are broken down by the enzyme plasmin, which cuts fibrin fibers at specific places, thus helping the regulation of clot persistence. A mechanistic understanding of fibrin degradation by plasmin is still missing. An important determinant of this process might be the flexibility of fibrinogen. The flexible nature of fibrinogen is reported, for example, by the great variety of conformations observed when fibrinogen adsorbs on material surfaces. However, limits in the spatial resolution of these experiments preclude the identification of the atomistic mechanism behind this flexibility. Here, we perform computer simulations that help identifying with atomistic detail large bending motions occurring at a specific hinge on the molecule. We show how these bending motions can explain the variable conformations observed in experiments and how they help exposing sites where plasmin can cut fibrinogen. Furthermore, our simulations let us identify cooperative effects involving several distant parts of fibrinogen that may play a role in the assembly of fibrin fibers. Both the bending and the cooperative effects, thus, represent potential mechanisms for the regulation of blood clotting.
