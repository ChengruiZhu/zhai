Osteosarcoma is one of the most highly malignant types of cancer in adolescents and young adults with a high mortality rate. Despite advances in surgery, radiation therapy and chemotherapy, the prognosis for patients with osteosarcoma has not significantly improved over the past several decades. It is necessary to find new indicators of prognosis and therapeutic targets of osteosarcoma. Through the analysis of 40 osteosarcoma tissues, we found that the expression of miR-486 was low and the expression of PKC-δ was high in osteosarcoma. Median survival of patients with low expression of miR-486 (30 months) was shorter than the patients with higher expression of miR-486 (40 months). We further found that miR-486 can inhibit the targeting of PKC-δ signaling pathways, and this inhibition can inhibit the growth and invasion of osteosarcoma cells. After transfection of miR-486 for 24 h, the proliferation of osteosarcoma cells was inhibited by ~20%, and the migration was inhibited by ~15%. In the present investigation, we demonstrated that miR-486 is negatively associated with the expression of PKC-δ and could regulate the development of osteosarcoma. miR-486 may be a potential target for the treatment of osteosarcoma.
