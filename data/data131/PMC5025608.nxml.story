Of the 111 samples analyzed, 35 patients were asymptomatic carriers (ASC), 24 with a chronic active hepatitis (CAH), 33 with liver cirrhosis (LC) and 19 have a hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The mean age were 45 ± 13 year, 88 (79.3 %) were male and 23 (20.7 %) female. The prevalence of HBeAg was 15.3 % and 73 % of subjects were anti-HBe positive. The mean serum level of alanine aminotransferase transaminase (ALT) and aspartate transaminase (AST) was 25.1 ± 9 IU/L and 28.6 ± 10 IU/L respectively. Eighty two samples out of 111 (73.9 %) were genotyped by the analyzing of the S region of HBV, 58 (70.7 %) cases belonged to HBV genotype E and 24 (29.3 %) were genotype A with three subgenotypes; A3 (66.7 %), A4 (20.8 %) and A6 (12.5 %). Prevalence of genotype A was relatively high in CAH (33.3 %) and HCC (31.6 %) patients in comparison with other groups. The most prevalent amino acids substitutions were R38K found in 14 (17.1 %) sequences, following by H44L in 11 (13.4 %), K13E in 8 (9.8 %), N29K in 8 (9.8 %), A35E in 8 (9.8 %), V80I in 7 (8.5 %) and in 6 (7.3 %) sequences for S90T. Different substitutions located in the hepatocyte binding site were higher among patients with LC and HCC (
