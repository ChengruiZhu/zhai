The circuits of the sensory cortex are able to extract useful information from sensory inputs because of their exquisitely organized synaptic connections. These connections are wired largely through experience-dependent synaptic plasticity. Although many details of both the phenomena and cellular mechanisms of cortical synaptic plasticity are now known, an understanding of the computational principles by which synaptic plasticity wires cortical networks lags far behind this experimental data. In this study, we provide a theoretical framework for cortical plasticity termed the “Convallis rule”. The computational power of this rule is demonstrated by its ability to cause simulated cortical networks to learn representations of real-world speech data. Application of the rule to paradigms used to probe synaptic plasticity in vitro reproduced a large number of experimental findings, and the mathematical form of the rule is consistent with a dual coincidence detector mechanism that has been suggested experimentally in juvenile neocortex. Based on this confluence of normative, phenomenological, and mechanistic evidence, we suggest that the rule may approximate a fundamental computational principle of the neocortex.
