In a crowded visual scene, attention must be efficiently and flexibly distributed over time and space to accommodate different contexts in a task. Recent studies have proposed that attention is a dynamic process that organizes copious information temporally. However, how the brain coordinates attention among multiple visual objects and whether this dynamic mechanism mediates attention at a general level remain largely unknown. In this study, we analyze electroencephalography (EEG) recordings during a multi-object selective attention task to extract object-specific neuronal responses. We demonstrate that attention rhythmically switches between visual objects every approximately 200 ms. Furthermore, the spatiotemporal sampling profile of attention adaptively changes in various task contexts and correlates with behavioral performance during attention. Our work provides direct neural evidence supporting the idea that multiple objects are sequentially sorted according to their priority in attentional contexts. The results suggest that attention is intrinsically dynamic, acting as a series of concatenating chunks of attention that operate on 1 object at a time to maintain awareness of the whole scene.
