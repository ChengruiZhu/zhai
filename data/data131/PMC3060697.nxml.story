Water movement between cells in a plant body is the basic phenomenon of plant solute transport; however, it has not been well documented due to limitations in observational techniques. This paper reports a visualization technique to observe water movement among plant cells in different tissues using a time of flight-secondary ion mass spectrometry (Tof-SIMS) cryo-system. The specific purpose of this study is to examine the route of water supply from xylem to stem tissues. The maximum resolution of Tof-SIMS imaging was 1.8 μm (defined as the three pixel step length), which allowed detection of water movement at the cellular level. Deuterium-labelled water was found in xylem vessels in the stem 2.5 min after the uptake of labelled water by soybean plants. The water moved from the xylem to the phloem, cambium, and cortex tissues within 30–60 min after water absorption. Deuterium ion counts in the phloem complex were slightly higher than those in the cortex and cambium tissue seen in enlarged images of stem cell tissue during high transpiration. However, deuterium ion counts in the phloem were lower than those in the cambium at night with no evaporative demand. These results indicate that the stem tissues do not receive water directly from the xylem, but rather from the phloem, during high evaporative demand. In contrast, xylem water would be directly supplied to the growing sink during the night without evaporative demand.
