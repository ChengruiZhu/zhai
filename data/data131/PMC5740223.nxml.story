Patient-specific computational models have been extensively developed over the last decades and applied to investigate a wide range of cardiovascular problems. However, translation of these technologies into clinical applications, such as planning of medical procedures, has been limited to a few single case reports. Hence, the use of patient-specific models is still far from becoming a standard of care in clinical practice. The aim of this study is to describe our experience with a modelling framework that allows patient-specific simulations to be used for prediction of clinical outcomes. A cohort of 12 patients with congenital heart disease who were referred for percutaneous pulmonary valve implantation, stenting of aortic coarctation and surgical repair of double-outlet right ventricle was included in this study. Image data routinely acquired for clinical assessment were post-processed to set up patient-specific models and test device implantation and surgery. Finite-element and computational fluid dynamics analyses were run to assess feasibility of each intervention and provide some guidance. Results showed good agreement between simulations and clinical decision including feasibility, device choice and fluid-dynamic parameters. The promising results of this pilot study support translation of computer simulations as tools for personalization of cardiovascular treatments.
