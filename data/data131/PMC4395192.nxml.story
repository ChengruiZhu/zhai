Human leucocyte antigen (HLA)-G has seven isoforms, of which HLA-G1-G4 are membrane-bound and HLA-G5-G7 are soluble. Previous studies reinforced HLA-G expression was strongly related to poor prognosis in different types of cancers. Among these studies, the monoclonal antibody (mAb) 4H84 was used which detects all HLA-G isoform heavy chain; unfortunately, leaves the specific types of isoforms expressed in lesions undistinguished and its clinical significance needs to be clarified. To explore clinical significance of lesion soluble HLA-G (sHLA-G) in non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC), mAb 5A6G7 recognizing HLA-G5/-G6 molecules was used. Tumour cell sHLA-G expression in 131 primary NSCLC lesions (66 squamous cell carcinoma, 55 adenocarcinoma and 10 adenosquamous carcinoma) were analysed with immunohistochemistry. Data showed that sHLA-G expression was observed in 34.0% (45/131) of the NSCLC lesions, which was unrelated to patient age, sex, lymph nodal status, tumour–node–metastasis stage and patient survival. However, tumour cell sHLA-G expression in lesions was predominately observed in adenocarcinoma lesions (73.0%, 40/55) which was significantly higher than that in squamous cell carcinoma (6.0%, 4/66) and adenosquamous carcinoma lesions (10.0%, 1/10,
