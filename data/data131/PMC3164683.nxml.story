Aging is a genetically and environmentally modulated process. One particular manifestation of aging in humans is the age-related changes that affect the female reproductive system. It is well established that chromosome-number abnormalities in offspring occur more frequently as maternal age advances, but the meiotic mechanisms involved remain unclear. Meiotic recombination has been associated with maternal age in different species but contrasting effects of maternal age on recombination rates have been reported among mammals. In this study, we found a decrease of recombination rates with increasing maternal age in a French-Canadian cohort, with the most pronounced decline possibly occurring before 32 years of age. We observed chromosome-specific age effects, and in older women recombination frequencies are notably reduced in the middle portion of chromosomal arms and near subtelomeric regions. No paternal age effect on recombination was found, highlighting differences in patterns of variation among sexes. Many studies have shown significant inter-individual variation in genome-wide recombination rates, and our results points to an additional, intra-individual source of variation in recombination rates among transmissions from the same mother.
