It is well recognized that the prevalence of dementia is higher in diabetic patients than non‐diabetic subjects. The incidence of diabetes has been increasing because of dramatic changes in lifestyles, and combined with longer lifespans as a result of advances in medical technology, this has brought about an increase in the number of elderly diabetic patients. Together, aging and diabetes have contributed to dementia becoming a serious problem. Progression to dementia reduces quality of life, and imposes a burden on both patients themselves and the families supporting them. Therefore, preventing the complication of dementia will become more and more important in the future. Although many mechanisms have been considered for an association between diabetes and cognitive dysfunction, glucose metabolism abnormalities such as hyperglycemia and hypoglycemia, and insulin action abnormalities such as insulin deficiency and insulin resistance can be causes of cognitive impairment. Recent large‐scale longitudinal studies have found an association between glycemic control and cognitive decline, although it is still unclear how cognitive decline might be prevented by good glycemic control. However, at an early stage, it is necessary to detect moderate cognitive dysfunction and try to reduce the risk factors for it, which should result in prevention of dementia, as well as vascular events. In the present review, in addition to outlining an association between diabetes and cognitive function, we discuss how glycemic control and cognitive decline are related.
