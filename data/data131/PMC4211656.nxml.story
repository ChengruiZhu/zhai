In addition to carrying genetic information from DNA to protein, RNAs function in many essential cellular processes. This often requires the RNA to form a specific three-dimensional structure, and some functions require cycling between multiple structures. However, RNAs have a strong propensity to become trapped in nonfunctional, misfolded structures. Due to the intrinsic stability of local structure for RNA, these misfolded species can be long-lived and therefore accumulate. ATP-dependent RNA chaperone proteins called DEAD-box proteins are known to promote native RNA folding by disrupting misfolded structures. Although these proteins can unwind short RNA helices, the mechanism by which they act upon higher order tertiary contacts is unknown. Our current work shows that DEAD-box proteins capture transiently exposed RNA helices, preventing any tertiary contacts from reforming and potentially destabilizing the global RNA architecture. Helix unwinding by the DEAD-box protein then allows the product RNA strands to form new contacts. This helix capture mechanism for manipulation of RNA tertiary structure does not require a specific binding motif or structural environment and may be general for DEAD-box helicase proteins that act on structured RNAs.
