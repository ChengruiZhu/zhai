Slow, progressive, and destructive changes in the residual lung after surgery for lung cancer, known as “destroyed lung,” are delayed nonrecurrent complications. Destroyed lung can be a difficult condition to treat due to repeated infections and is therefore a complication that should not be ignored. We had three cases of intractable pulmonary aspergillosis difficult to treat associated with destroyed lung, after lung cancer surgery. Two of these patients followed a characteristic clinical course, which started with a cystic change just below the pleura and subsequently led to respiratory failure and death due to repeated infections. The third patient followed a similar clinical course and is currently under regular follow-up. Our cases suggest that concomitant occurrence of severe complications following surgery for lung cancer, such as destroyed lung and pulmonary aspergillosis, should be monitored because these complications can lead to respiratory failure and fatal clinical course. Radical surgery is not possible, especially when medical treatment is ineffective in controlling repeated infections and the patient's general condition is worsened due to prolonged chronic inflammation. Therefore, aggressive surgical intervention should be considered before patients worsen.
