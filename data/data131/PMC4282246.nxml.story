Nesfatin-1 is a recently discovered anorexigenic peptide which is distributed in several brain areas implicated in the feeding and metabolic regulation. Recently, it has been reported that nesfatin-1 is expressed not only in brain, but also in peripheral organs such as digestive organs, adipose tissues, heart, and reproductive organs. Nesfatin-1 is markedly expressed in the pancreas, stomach and duodenum. Eventually, the nesfatin-1 expression in the digestive organs may be regulated by nutritional status, which suggests a regulatory role of peripheral nesfatin-1 in energy homeostasis. Nesfatin-1 is also detected in the adipose tissues of humans and rodents, indicating that nesfatin-1 expression in the fat may regulate food intake independently, rather than relying on leptin. In addition, nesfatin-1 is expressed in the heart as a cardiac peptide. It suggests that nesfatin-1 may regulate cardiac function and encourage clinical potential in the presence of nutrition-dependent physio-pathologic cardiovascular diseases. Currently, only a few studies demonstrate that nesfatin-1 is expressed in the reproductive system. However, it is not clear yet what function of nesfatin-1 is in the reproductive organs. Here, we summarize the expression of nesfatin-1 and its roles in brain and peripheral organs and discuss the possible roles of nesfatin-1 expressed in reproductive organs, including testis, epididymis, ovary, and uterus. We come to the conclusion that nesfatin-1 as a local regulator in male and female reproductive organs may regulate the steroidogenesis in the testis and ovary and the physiological activity in epididymis and uterus.
