A novel type of NCI correction is presented for density functional theory (DFT) methods. In this approach, the general regression neural network machine learning method is used to perform the correction for DFT methods on the basis of DFT calculations. Various DFT methods, including M06-2X, B3LYP, B3LYP-D3, PBE, PBE-D3 and ωB97XD, with two small basis sets (i.e., 6-31G* and 6-31+G*) were investigated. Moreover, the conductor-like polarizable continuum model with two types of solvents (i.e., water and pentylamine, which mimics a protein environment with ε = 4.2) were considered in the DFT calculations. With the correction, the root mean square errors of all DFT calculations were improved by at least 70 %. Relative to CCSD(T)/CBS benchmark values (used as experimental NCI values because of its high accuracy), the mean absolute error of the best result was 0.33 kcal/mol, which is comparable to high-level ab initio methods or DFT methods with fairly large basis sets. Notably, this level of accuracy is achieved within a fraction of the time required by other methods. For all of the correction models based on various DFT approaches, the validation parameters according to OECD principles (i.e., the correlation coefficient
