Alcohol use is common among people infected with HIV and may contribute to adverse consequences such as reduced adherence to treatment regimens and increased likelihood of risky sexual behaviors. Therefore, researchers and clinicians are looking for treatment approaches to reduce harmful alcohol consumption in this population. However, clinical trials of existing treatment models are scarce. A literature review identified only 11 studies that included HIV-infected patients with past or current risky alcohol use and which targeted alcohol use and other health behaviors. Four studies focusing on HIV-infected participants with alcohol problems found mixed effects on adherence and on alcohol use. Five clinical trials included at least 10 percent of HIV-infected subjects who use alcohol; of these, only one reported significant evidence of a favorable impact on alcohol consumption. Finally, two trials targeting alcohol users at high risk for HIV infection identified treatment effects that were not sustained. Taken together, these findings provide limited evidence of the benefit of behavioral interventions in this population. Nevertheless, these studies give some guidance for future interventions in HIV-infected patients with alcohol problems.
