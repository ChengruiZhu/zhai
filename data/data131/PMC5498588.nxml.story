Paget’s disease of bone (PDB) is a common skeletal disorder characterised by focal abnormalities of increased and disorganised bone turnover. Genetic factors play a central role in the pathogenesis of PDB but environmental factors also contribute. Measles virus (MV), respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and canine distemper virus (CDV) have all been implicated as potential disease triggers but the data are conflicting. Since chronic paramyxovirus infection with measles is known to be accompanied by increased production of antiviral antibodies, we have analysed circulating concentrations of antibodies to MV, CDV, and RSV as well as mumps, rubella and varicella zoster virus (VZV) in 463 patients with PDB and 220 aged and gender-matched controls. We also studied the relation between viral antibody concentrations and various markers of disease severity and extent in 460 PDB patients. A high proportion of cases and controls tested positive for antiviral antibodies but there was no significant difference in circulating antibody concentrations between PDB cases and controls for MV, CDV, RSV, rubella or VZV. However, mumps virus antibody levels were significantly higher in the PDB cases (mean ± SD = 3.1 ± 0.84 vs. 2.62 ± 0.86.
