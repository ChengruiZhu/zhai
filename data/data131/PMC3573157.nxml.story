Recent studies have reported that DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs) and histone deacetylases (HDACs) are involved in the epigenetic regulation of cancer, as well as promoting cell proliferation and tumorigenesis. These mechanisms also play important roles in ovarian cancer, but little is known concerning the correlation of DNMTs and HDACs in ovarian cancer. In the present study, we used quantitative real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) and immunohistochemical staining to examine the mRNA and protein expression of DNMTs and class I HDACs of tissues from 22 cases of ovarian cancer and 8 normal ovaries as a control. Furthermore, we assessed the correlation with clinicopathological stages and the mRNA expression of these genes. The results indicated that the mRNA expression of DNMT1, DNMT3b and class I HDACs was increased in ovarian cancers, while the expression of DNMT3a was not different between cancer tissues and normal ovaries. Additionally, the results of immunohistochemical staining demonstrated that DNMT1 and DNMT3b were significantly increased in ovarian cancer samples. Furthermore, the expression of DNMT1, DNMT3b, HDAC1 and HDAC2 was significantly higher in stage III/IV compared with stage I/II ovarian carcinomas. The expression of HDAC2 was positively correlated with HDCA1, HDAC3 and HDAC8, and DNMT1 was positively correlated with DNMT3b. Simultaneously, DNMT3b was correlated with HDAC1 and HDAC2. HDAC1 may upregulate the expression of DNMTs, but this requires confirmation by
