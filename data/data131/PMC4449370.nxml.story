We determined the feasibility and clinical efficacy of simultaneous bilateral video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) for treating primary spontaneous pneumothorax (PSP). We performed a retrospective analysis of the efficacy of simultaneous bilateral resection of pulmonary bullae using VATS in 21 PSP patients that were treated at our hospital from February 2010 to August 2013. We found bilateral bullae in all patients through the intraoperative exploration. Surgical procedures were successfully completed in all patients without conversion to thoracotomy. The mean time of surgery was 128.76 ± 13.82 min (range 100–150 min). Total amount of intraoperative bleeding was 80–200 ml. Total drainage of bilateral thoracic ducts was 200–500 ml at the 1st postoperative day with a mean drainage of 321.42 ± 82.66 ml. Bilateral thoracic ducts were removed 4–8 days postoperatively with a mean time of 4.7 days. The duration of postoperative hospitalization was 5–9 days with a mean duration of 7 days. No patient had serious complication(s) and all patients were discharged after full recovery. The patients were followed up for 6–18 months after the surgery and no relapse occurred. In conclusion, treating the unilateral PSP by simultaneous bilateral VATS is safe and effective. It reduces patients’ risk of second surgery and also minimizes patients’ suffering and costs incurred.
