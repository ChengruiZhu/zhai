Cell continuously receives signals from the surrounding environment and is supposed to make correct decisions, i.e., respond properly to various signals and initiate certain cellular functions. Modeling and quantification of decision making processes in a cell have emerged as important areas of research in recent years. Due to signal transduction noise, cells respond differently to similar inputs, which may result in incorrect cell decisions. Here we develop a novel method for characterization of decision making processes in cells, using statistical signal processing and decision theory concepts. To demonstrate the utility of the method, we apply it to an important signaling pathway that regulates molecules which play key roles in cell survival. Our method reveals that cells can make two types of incorrect decisions, namely, false alarm and miss events. We measure the likelihood of these decisions using single cell experimental data, and demonstrate how these incorrect decisions are related to the signal transduction noise or absence of certain molecular functions. Using our method, decision making errors in other molecular systems can be modeled. Such models are useful for understanding and developing treatments for pathological processes such as inflammation, various cancers and autoimmune diseases.
