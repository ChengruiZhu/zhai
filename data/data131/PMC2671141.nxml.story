The repair of DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) is essential for the maintenance of genome integrity. The mechanisms by which DSBs are repaired have been the subject of intense experimental investigations. It has emerged that several imperfect repair pathways exist in eukaryotes that have the potential to result in chromosomal alterations, including genomic duplications. However, it remains unclear to what extent these imperfect repair events have contributed to shaping genomes throughout evolution. Here we introduce an innovative computational approach that takes advantage of the repetitive nature of eukaryotic genomes to identify repair-mediated duplications (RD) that occurred during evolution. We discovered over one thousand RDs in the human genome, with two-thirds resulting from the capture of a chromosomal DNA segment located in close proximity to the presumed site of the DSB, giving rise to local genomic duplications. Comparative genomic analyses reveal that the mechanism has operated continuously, but with decreasing intensity during primate evolution, generating species-specific duplications in all primates surveyed and generating genomic variation among humans. Finally, we show that RDs have also occurred in non-primate mammals and other vertebrates, indicating that this is a previously under-appreciated force shaping vertebrate genomes.
