In all, ten patients participated in the three focus group interviews. The informants were 35â€“79 years of age, seven were male. Their social background and present situation varied greatly. Three were living alone. At the time of interview eight were receiving social benefits, one was unsettled and one had returned to work. All reported several handicaps, five had speech problems and one had visual problems. Timeframe from discharge to interview ranged from; the same day to one year. In all, eight wives and one husband participated in the two focus group interviews for relatives. For half of them, their spouses had participated in the patient interviews. They all reported their spouse to be physically handicapped and six of them experiencing changes in personality after suffering a stroke. The patients had suddenly been struck by a disease changing not only their own but also the lives of their close relative. After long period of hospitalization it had been of great importance to visit the home. This and the home training sessions had helped clarifying as well as focussing and motivating further training. For the relatives home training had meant a greater peace of mind and better knowledge, e.g. how to act and support their handicapped spouse. It had been of great value establishing the contact to the primary health service before discharge. Barriers for benefit were long distances, meaning long and exhausting travelling and limited time at home. It was of importance that the purpose of going home was clarified and that the therapists were receptive of and respecting the wishes of the patient in relation to his/her dealings in the home and changes of the home environment.
