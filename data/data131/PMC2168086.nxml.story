-terminal 63 amino acids of AE1-4, primarily accumulates in the apical membrane. Mutagenesis studies have shown that the basolateral accumulation of AE1-4 is dependent upon two tyrosine residues at amino acids 44 and 47 of the polypeptide. Interestingly, either of these tyrosines is sufficient to direct efficient basolateral sorting of AE1-4. However, in the absence of both tyrosine residues, AE1-4 accumulates in the apical membrane of MDCK cells. Pulseâ€“chase studies have shown that after delivery to the cell surface, newly synthesized AE1-4 is recycled to the Golgi where it acquires additional N-linked sugar modifications. This Golgi recycling activity is dependent upon the same cytoplasmic tyrosine residues that are required for the basolateral sorting of this variant transporter. Furthermore, mutants of AE1-4 that are defective in Golgi recycling are unable to associate with the detergent insoluble actin cytoskeleton and are rapidly turned over. These studies, which represent the first description of tyrosine-dependent cytoplasmic sorting signal for a type III membrane protein, have suggested a critical role for the actin cytoskeleton in regulating AE1 anion exchanger localization and stability in this epithelial cell type.
