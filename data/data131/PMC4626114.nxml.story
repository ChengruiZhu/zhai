Allergy is an increasingly widespread clinical problem that leads to various conditions such as allergic asthma and susceptibility to anaphylactic shock. These conditions arise from exposure to a range of environmental and food proteins (‘allergens’) that are recognised by a form of immune system antibody called IgE. This part of the immune system is thought to have evolved to provide mammals with additional rapid response mechanisms to combat metazoan parasites. Here, we address the pertinent question, ‘what makes an Allergen an Allergen’ as, although they constitute a very small percentage of known proteins, they appear to be diverse and unrelated. Using computational studies, we have established molecular similarity between parasite proteins and allergens that affect the nature of immune response and are able to predict the regions of parasite proteins that potentially share similarity with the IgE-binding region(s) of the allergens. Our experimental studies support the computational predictions, and we can present the first confirmed example of a plant pollen-like protein in a worm that is targeted by IgE. The results of this study will enable us to predict likely allergens in food and environmental organisms and to help design protein molecules to treat allergy in the future.
