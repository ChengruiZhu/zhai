Ataxin-3 (ATX-3) is a ubiquitously expressed protein that mutated in a neurodegenerative disease called spinocerebellar ataxia type 3 (SCA3). It contains a polyglutamine (polyQ) tract near its C-terminus, the expansion of which is known to be the causative factor for SCA3. It has been known for a long time that ATX-3 is a deubiquitinating enzyme (DUB). However, the substrates targeted by ATX-3 in the physiological context remain elusive, thus largely limiting our understanding of its cellular function and that of the pathogenic mechanism of SCA3. This study has identified p53 to be a novel substrate of ATX-3, and its function is tightly regulated by ATX-3. PolyQ expansion augments ATX-3â€™s cellular function in p53 regulation. Due to enhanced interaction to p53 and up-regulation of p53, polyQ-expanded ATX-3 led to an increased p53-dependent neuronal cell death in zebrafish and mouse models, thus providing clear in vivo evidences for the direct involvement of p53 in SCA3 pathology. This study not only establishes a basic function of ATX-3 but also provides an explanation of how the interplays between ATX-3 and p53 contribute to the SCA3 pathogenesis; thus, it is an important contribution for the future development of therapeutic approaches for this currently untreatable neurodegenerative disease.
