Fucosylation, which is catalyzed by fucosyltransferases (FUTs), is one of the most important glycosylation events involved in cancer. Studies have shown that fucosyltransferase 8 (FUT8) is overexpressed in NSCLC and promotes lung cancer progression. However, there are no reports about the pathological role of fucosyltransferase 2 (FUT2) in lung cancer. To identify FUT2 associated with lung cancer, the expression and clinical significance of FUT2 in lung cancer was investigated by Real-Time PCR, Immunohistochemistry and Western Blot. In addition, we investigated the effect of knockdown FUT2 in lung adenocarcinoma cells. The results showed that the expression of FUT2 in lung adenocarcinoma is higher than that in adjacent noncancerous tissues. Knocking down FUT2 in A549 and H1299 cells decreased cell proliferation, migration and invasion, and increased cell apoptosis compared to corresponding control cells. Furthermore, Western Blot showed that knockdown FUT2 can impact the expression of migration-associated and apoptosis-associated proteins in A549 cells. Our results suggest that FUT2 may be associated with lung adenocarcinoma development and thus is a potential biomarker or/and therapeutic target in lung adenocarcinoma.
