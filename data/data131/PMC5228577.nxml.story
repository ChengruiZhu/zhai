Nanotechnology is the latest evolving field and its applications in medicine in recent decades has shown great potential. It has also given a new face to the therapeutics against cancer in recent years. The electronic databases of MEDLINE, EMBASE and PubMed were searched for recent studies, reporting the importance of nanomedicine. The concluding remarks of the above papers mostly confirmed the growing potential of nanomedicine, particularly in the field of cancer. Furthermore, nanomedicine has been observed to promote the therapeutic effect of agents by formulating them into nanocarriers. Delivery of the therapeutic agents via nanodelivery systems is dedicated to solving problems in traditional anticancer agents, including formulation in the physiological environment, their accumulation in tumor, and their adverse side effect in normal organs. The present review focused on the latest updates on nanotechnology in cancer. In conclusion, the future of any therapeutic option lies in the specific delivery of the particular drug. Additionally, this specific delivery may be achieved efficiently by nanodelivery systems and more studies should be conducted in this direction for the establishment of nanodelivery systems as gold standard delivery modules in clinical setting.
