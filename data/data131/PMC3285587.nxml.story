Exposure to arsenic through drinking water is a serious public health issue in many countries, including Bangladesh and the United States. Although there is substantial inter-individual variation in arsenic metabolism and toxicity, the biological basis of this variation is not well understood. Here, we have conducted the first genome-wide association study of arsenic-related traits within a unique population cohort of arsenic-exposed Bangladeshi individuals. Using data on 1,313 well-characterized individuals, we identify multiple association signals for urinary arsenic metabolite concentrations in the 10q24.32 regions, near the AS3MT (arsenite methyltransferase) gene. In a subsequent analysis of >2,000 individuals, we show for the first time that variants that influence arsenic metabolism can also influence risk for arsenical skin lesions (the classical sign of arsenic toxicity) through interaction with arsenic exposure. Using array-based genome-wide gene expression data, we show that several of our lead genetic variants are associated with expression of AS3MT and neighboring gene C10orf32, providing a potential mechanism by which 10q24.32 variants influence arsenic metabolism and toxicity. Knowledge of variation in this region and associated biological processes could be used to develop intervention and pharmacological strategies aimed at preventing large numbers of arsenic-related deaths in arsenic-exposed populations.
