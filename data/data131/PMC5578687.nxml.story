Pedigrees contain information about the genealogical relationships among individuals. This information can be used in many areas of genetic studies such as disease association studies, conservation efforts, and for inferences about the demographic history and social structure of a population. Despite their importance, pedigrees are often unknown and must be estimated from genetic information. However, pedigree inference remains a difficult problem due to the high cost of likelihood computation and the enormous number of possible pedigrees that must be considered. These difficulties limit existing methods in their ability to infer pedigrees when the sample size or the number of markers is large, or when the sample contains only distant relatives. In this report, we present a method that circumvents these computational challenges in order to infer pedigrees of complex structure for a large number of individuals. Using simulations, we find that the method can infer distant relatives much more accurately than existing methods. Furthermore, we show that even pairwise inferences of relatedness can be improved substantially by consideration of the pedigree structure with other related individuals in the sample.
