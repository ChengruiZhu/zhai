A total of 100 patients (average age 32.2±9.9 years; 52 males, 48 females) who underwent OAT (50 isolated, 50 with MAT) with an average follow-up of 4.84±2.7 years (range, 2.0-15.1) were included. These patients underwent an average of 2.6±1.2 prior surgical procedures on the ipsilateral knee prior to OAT. A total of 38 patients underwent reoperation at an average 2.4±2.2 years, with 24% (9/38) undergoing additional reoperations (range, 1-2 additional reoperations). MAT patients did not have significantly different reoperation rates (MAT: 40%; non-MAT: 36%), time to reoperation (MAT: 2.20±2.31 years; non-MAT: 2.56±2.11 years) or failure rates (14% vs. 14%) compared to non-MAT patients. Both MAT and non-MAT patients showed significant improvement in Lysholm, IKCD, KOOS, WOMAC, and SF-12 physical subscale as compared to preoperative values (P>0.05 for all for both groups). The SF-12 mental subscale was not significantly improved at final follow-up for either group. MAT patients demonstrated significantly higher SF-12 physical subscale as compared to non-MAT patients at most recent follow-up (45.81±7.42 vs 42.07±7.97, P<0.05). There were no significant differences detected in the defect size (MAT: 338.64±116.31 mm
