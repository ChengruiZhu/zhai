The present study describes a case of a painful supraclavicular soft-tissue metastasis of a skin melanoma invading the brachial plexus in a 38-year-old male. The patient was treated twice with radiofrequency ablation (RFA) under computed tomography (CT) guidance, which caused tumoral necrosis. The patient was originally referred with a 7-cm metastasis in the right supraclavicular fossa, which caused intractable pain and a degree of numbness. These symptoms were unresponsive to chemotherapy and radiotherapy and the pain was not controlled using narcotic analgesics. The lesion was treated with CT-guided RFA causing necrosis, relieving the pain and sparing the patient from using analgesics. The pain recurred 19 months thereafter and a CT scan revealed an 8-cm mass in the right supraclavicular space. The patient underwent repeat CT-guided RFA, which reduced the pain to a level that was controlled with minor oral analgesics. In conclusion, in this case of a painful supraclavicular soft-tissue metastasis invading the brachial plexus, which was intractable to chemotherapy and radiotherapy, RFA was feasible and offered substantial palliation of the symptoms, freedom from the use of narcotic analgesics and improvements to the quality of life.
