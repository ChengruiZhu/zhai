In the United Kingdom approximately 80,000 total hip arthroplasties are undertaken on an average each year. The popularity and demand for this operation are continually increasing. Our understanding of arthroplasty surgery and its complications has evolved greatly, and as a result infection rates are undeniably at an all-time low. The increasing volume of operations being performed does, however, mean that we still continue to see an increased number of cases of infection. There is no doubt that periprosthetic joint infection (PJI) poses a complex clinical and diagnostic predicament to clinicians. Delay in the diagnosis and treatment of PJI can not only be detrimental in terms of patient morbidity, but it also poses a significant financial burden to health care institutions. It is therefore in the best interest of the patient, surgeon, and institution to optimize the diagnosis and treatment of this devastating complication. There remains considerable variability in terms of approach to diagnosis and treatment of PJI among orthopedic surgeons. In this review, we will, therefore, examine in detail the current body of evidence available on PJI. We will discuss the most robust and up-to-date methods of diagnosis and offer a comparison of management strategies.
