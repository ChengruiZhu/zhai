Cardiovascular (CV) complications are the major cause of death in autosomal-dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) patients. Hypertension is common in these patients even before the onset of renal insufficiency. Blood pressure (BP) elevation is a key factor in patient outcome, mainly owing to the high prevalence of target organ damage together with a poor renal prognosis when BP is increased. Many factors have been implicated in the pathogenesis of hypertension, including the renin–angiotensin–aldosterone system (RAAS) stimulation. Polycystin deficiency may also contribute to hypertension because of its potential role in regulating the vascular tone. Early diagnosis and treatment of hypertension improve the CV and renal complications of this population. Ambulatory BP monitoring is recommended for prompt diagnosis of hypertension. CV risk assessment is mandatory. Even though a nonpharmacological approach should not be neglected, RAAS inhibitors are the cornerstone of hypertension treatment. Calcium channel blockers (CCBs) should be avoided unless resistant hypertension is present. The BP should be <140/90 mmHg in all ADPKD patients and a more intensive control (<135/85 mmHg) should be pursued as soon as microalbuminuria or left ventricle hypertrophy is present.
