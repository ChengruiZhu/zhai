Several studies have reported an association between −148 C/T polymorphism of Axis inhibition protein 2 (Axin2) and cancer risk; however, the results are inconsistent. In this study, a meta-analysis was performed to assess the association between −148 C/T polymorphism of Axin2 and susceptibility to cancer. Published case–control and cohort-based studies from PubMed, Embase, Wanfang, and CNKI were retrieved, and data were manually extracted. The odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) of the included studies were pooled. Begg’s and Egger’s tests were used to evaluate publication bias. Cumulative and recursive cumulative meta-analyses (CMA) were performed as evidence accumulated to investigate the trends and stability of the effect size. Nine articles with 1,664 cases and 1,796 controls were included. The pooled effect size showed an association between −148 C/T polymorphism and the risk of cancer (dominant model, OR: 0.72, 95% CI: 0.63–0.83; allele model, OR: 0.81, 95% CI: 0.73–0.90). CMA showed an association trend, and the recursive CMA indicated that more evidence is needed to make conclusions about significance. In a subgroup analysis, a significant association between −148 C/T polymorphism and low cancer susceptibility was detected for lung cancer (dominant model, 0.69, 95% CI: 0.56–0.85; recessive model, OR: 0.75, 95% CI: 0.56–0.99; allele model, 0.76, 95% CI: 0.66–0.86). The −148 C/T polymorphism was also associated with low cancer susceptibility among Asians (dominant model, OR: 0.68, 95% CI: 0.57–0.81; recessive model, OR: 0.75, 95% CI: 0.56–0.99; allele model, OR: 0.76, 95% CI: 0.66–0.86). The Axin2 −148 C/T polymorphism was found to be significantly associated with a decreased risk of cancer, particularly lung cancer, in Asians and population-based controls. Thus, Axin2 should be considered as a potential therapeutic target for preventing tumor growth.
