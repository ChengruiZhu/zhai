. 4 cm long transverse laceration was observed near the middle axillary line in the 6th right intercostal space in the examination performed on a 28 year old male patient who applied to the emergency service due to sharp penetrating object injury. Respiratory sounds were decreased in the right side and the examination revealed sensitivity in the abdomen. Elevation in the right diaphragm and hemopneumothorax was monitored in chest X-ray and computerized tomography. Closed subaqueous thorax drain was placed and the patient was taken to the surgery with a right diaphragm injury prediagnosis. Laparoscopic exploration was performed to the patient with stable hemodynamic findings by entering through 10 mm port above the abdomen. 6 cm long injury at the right side of diaphragm and approximately 2 cm deep at the deepest point and 5 cm long linear laceration was observed in the 7th segment of the liver. The diaphragm was repaired laparoscopically with sutures that do not melt on their own. Tampon was applied to the laceration in the liver and bleeding control was performed with suture. Patient was discharged on the 3rd day because he had no problems during postoperative follow-ups.
