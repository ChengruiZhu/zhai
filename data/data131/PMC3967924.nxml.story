While human and other eukaryotic genomes typically contain two copies of every chromosome, plants, yeast and fish such as salmon can have strictly more than two copies of each chromosome. By running standard genotype calling tools, it is possible to accurately identify the number of “wild type” and “mutant” alleles (A, C, G, or T) for each single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) site. However, in the case of two heterozygous SNP sites, genotype calling tools cannot determine whether “mutant” alleles from different SNP loci are on the same or different chromosomes. While the former would be healthy, in many cases the latter can cause loss of function; it is therefore necessary to identify the phase—the copies of a chromosome on which the mutant alleles occur—in addition to the genotype. This necessitates efficient algorithms to obtain accurate and comprehensive phase information directly from the next-generation-sequencing read data in higher ploidy species. We introduce an efficient statistical method for this task and show that our method significantly outperforms previous ones, in both accuracy and speed, for phasing triploid and higher ploidy genomes. Our method performs well on human diploid genomes as well, as demonstrated by our improved phasing of the well known NA12878 (1000 Genomes Project).
