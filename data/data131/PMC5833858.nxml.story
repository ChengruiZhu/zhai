UHRF1 (ubiquitin-like with PHD and ring finger domains 1) is highly expressed in various human cancers including retinoblastoma, and associated with tumor-promoting effects such as inhibition of apoptosis and high proliferation. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying tumor-promoting functions of UHRF1 in retinoblastoma still remain elusive. Here, we show that stable knockdown of UHRF1 renders retinoblastoma cells sensitized to conventional chemotherapeutic drugs such as etoposide and camptothecin, resulting in enhanced DNA damage and apoptotic cell death. We found that UHRF1-depleted retinoblastoma cells can recognize DNA damages normally but have markedly low expression of XRCC4 (X-ray repair cross complementing 4) among the components of nonhomologous end-joining (NHEJ) repair complex. Conversely, overexpression of UHRF1 increased the XRCC4 expression and stable knockdown of XRCC4 sensitized retinoblastoma cells to etoposide treatment, suggesting that XRCC4 is a key mediator for the drug sensitivity upon UHRF1 depletion in retinoblastoma cells. Consistent with the findings, chromatin association of DNA ligase IV in response to acute DNA damage was found to be significantly reduced in UHRF1-depleted retinoblastoma cells and functional complementation for XRCC4 in UHRF1-depleted cells attenuated the drug sensitivity, demonstrating that XRCC4 downregulation in UHRF1-depleted cells impaired DNA repair and consequently induced robust apoptosis upon genotoxic drug treatment. In human primary retinoblastoma, high expression of UHRF1 and XRCC4 could be detected, and elevated XRCC4 expression correlated with reduced apoptosis markers, implying that UHRF1-mediated XRCC4 upregulation under pathophysiological conditions triggered by
