Central lymph node metastases are common in patients with differentiated thyroid cancer (DTC). The management of preoperatively nodenegative (cN0) DTC is still under debate. The aim of this study was to analyse the difference in recurrence and surgical complications between thyroidectomy (TT) alone and TT combined with prophylactic central neck dissection (pCND) as initial treatments to DTC patients with cN0 and evaluate the clinic significance of pCND for these patients. PubMed, Ovid, Cochrane Library, and Web of Science databases were systematically searched using multiple search terms. Twenty-three articles with 6,823 patients were identified. The quality of evidence was assessed by Jadad quality scores and the Newcastle-Ottawa Quality assessment scale. The results showed that compared with patients who underwent TT alone, patients who underwent TT plus pCND had a significant higher rate of transient recurrent laryngeal nerve injury (p = 0.023), transient hypocalcaemia (p < 0.01) and permanent hypocalcaemia (p<0.01). There was a trend towards lower central neck recurrence rate in TT plus pCND (p < 0.01). Combined TT and pCND as initial treatment for DTC patients with cN0 may reduce the risk of recurrence, but increases the incidence of some complications. Methodologically high-quality comparative studies are needed for further evaluation.
