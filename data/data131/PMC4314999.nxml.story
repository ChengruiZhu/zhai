Apoptosis is one of the major types of programmed cell death. During this process, cells experience a series of morphological and biochemical changes. Flow cytometric analysis of Annexin V staining of cell surface phosphatidylserine, in combination with a DNA-staining dye to probe the permeability of the cell membrane, is an established method for detecting apoptosis. The present study aimed to show that the immunofluorescence analysis of cytokeratin (CK) 8/18 staining may provide a new and sensitive assay for the detection of apoptotic cells. Tumor cells were treated with 20 μM cisplatin to induce apoptosis. Following 12 and 24 h of cisplatin treatment, cells were collected and stained with 4′,6-diamidine-2′-phenylindole dihydrochloride (DAPI) and fluorescein-labeled anti-CK8/18 antibody. The apoptotic cells were subsequently examined by fluorescence microscopy. Annexin V-fluorescein isothiocyanate/propidium iodide staining followed by flow cytometric analysis confirmed that cisplatin was able to induce apoptosis in tumor cells. Immunofluorescence analysis demonstrated that apoptotic cells had a distinct CK8/18 staining pattern. In living cells, CK8/18 was uniformly distributed in the cytoplasm and cytosol; however in the apoptotic cells with a condensed and/or fragmented apoptotic nucleus (as identified by DAPI staining), fluorescein-labeled anti-CK8/18 antibody exhibited unusual punctate and/or bubbly staining in the cytosol. In the apoptotic cells that could not be identified by DAPI staining, fluorescein-labeled CK8/18 displayed polarized aggregated staining in the cytosol. These results indicate that fluorescein-conjugated CK8/18 may be a useful and sensitive indicator of cell apoptosis.
