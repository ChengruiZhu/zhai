We present the case of a 33-year-old man who experienced a 10,000-V electrical shock when working with electrical wiring. He suffered third-degree burns on his scalp at the right occiput (entry wound) and on his left arm (exit would), and a second-degree burn on his left foot (exit wound). He presented with severe spasticity of both lower extremities, motor weakness with a Medical Research Council grade of 3, and sensory impairments below thoracic level 11 that included an inability to sense light touch and defects in proprioception. Initial magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans of his spine and brain showed no definite abnormalities. However, tractography obtained by diffusion tensor imaging of the brain showed absence of the right medial lemniscus tract. A cervical MRI scan 1 month later showed spinal cord swelling from cervical 1-5 levels, and signal changes in the lateral and posterior white matter in the axial view. After 6 months of rehabilitation, he recovered almost normal degree of motor function in his lower extremities and disappearance of spasticity. However, since the sensory impairments persisted, especially defects in proprioception, he was unable to walk independently.
