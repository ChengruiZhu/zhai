Individuals with autoimmune disease generally demonstrate excessive immune system activation, leading to inflammation and damage of specific target organs. However, in some cases the detrimental effects of an overactive immune system might be counterbalanced by a beneficial effect in protecting against certain infections. In this study, we investigated whether patients with psoriasis, a common autoimmune disease of the skin, harbor genetic variants that are associated with an enhanced ability to limit replication of the HIV-1 virus. We profiled the HLA (human leukocyte antigen) immune genes located on chromosome 6 in 1,727 Caucasian psoriasis cases and 3,581 healthy controls and found that psoriasis patients are significantly more likely than controls to have gene variants that are protective against HIV-1 disease. We found that this enrichment for HIV-1 protective variants was unique to psoriasis and largely absent in patients with other autoimmune or inflammatory diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis, Crohn's disease, type 1 diabetes, type 2 diabetes, and coronary artery disease. Our results suggest the possibility that the excessive skin inflammation in psoriasis may be associated with activation of anti-viral immune pathways that were important to human ancestors who encountered viruses similar to HIV-1.
