Translation is the production of proteins by decoding mRNA produced in transcription, and is a part of the overall process of gene expression. Although the general theoretical background of translation is known, the process is still poorly characterised at the level of individual proteins. In particular, the quantitative parameters of translation, such as time required to complete it or the number of protein molecules produced from a transcript during its lifetime, are extremely difficult to measure experimentally. To overcome this problem, we developed a computational model that, on the basis of only few datasets and general assumptions, measures quantitatively the translational activity at the level of individual genes. We discussed it concerning the example of the yeast system; however, it can be applied to any organism of known genome. We used the obtained results to study the general characteristics of the yeast translational system, revealing the diversity of strategies of gene expression regulation. We exemplified and discussed other possible ways of model utilisation, as it may help in examining protein-protein interactions, metabolic pathways, gene annotation, ribosome queueing, protein folding, and translation initiation. It also may be crucial for better integration of cell-wide, high-throughput experiments.
