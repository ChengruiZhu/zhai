The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) has recommended against PSA-based screening for prostate cancer due to potential possibilities of false-results. Since no alternative test is available to replace it, we have initiated a trial with the purpose of establishing whether Galectin-3 (Gal-3) serum level and/or the patients immune response to PSA and Gal-3 antigens could complement the PSA test as diagnostic tools for prostate cancer patients. A blind, prospective, single institution, pilot study was conducted. A total of 95 men were recruited and classified into 5 different groups: healthy controls (Group1), newly diagnosed patients (Group2), no recurrence after local therapy (Group3), rising PSA after local therapy (Group4), and metastatic patients (Group5). The primary endpoints were the levels of serum PSA, PSA autoantibodies (AAPSA), Gal-3, and Gal-3 autoantibodies (AAGal-3). Data were analyzed by Spearmans rank correlation (rho) and least squares linear regression modeling. The expression levels of PSA, AAPSA, Gal-3, and AAGal-3 were determined in both healthy controls and prostate cancer patients. Negative correlations were observed between PSA and AAPSA levels among all 95 men combined (rho = âˆ’0.321,
