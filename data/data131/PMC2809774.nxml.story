Induction of double-strand breaks (DSBs) in chromosomal DNA effectively activates a program of cellular suicide and is widely used for chemotherapy on malignant cancer cells. Cells resist such therapies by quickly repairing the DSBs. Repair is carried out by two major DSB repair pathways, homologous recombination (HR) and nonhomologous end-joining. However, these pathways cannot join DSBs if their ends are chemically modified, as seen in the DSB ends that would arise after the prolonged treatment of the cells with topoisomerase inhibitors such as camptothecin and etoposide. These anti-cancer drugs can produce the polypeptides covalently attached to the 3′ or 5′ end of DSBs. It remains elusive which enzymes eliminate these chemical modifications prior to repair. We here show evidence that the BRCA1-CtIP complex plays a role in eliminating this chemical modification, thereby facilitating subsequent DSB repair. Thus, BRCA1 and CtIP have dual functions: their previously documented roles in HR and this newly identified function. This study contributes to our ability to predict the effectiveness of chemotherapeutic agents prior to their selection by evaluating the activity of individual repair factors. Accurate prediction is crucial, because chemotherapeutic agents that cause DNA damage have such strong side effects.
