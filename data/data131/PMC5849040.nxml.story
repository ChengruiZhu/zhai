Cell engraftment, survival and integration during transplantation procedures represent the crux of cell-based therapies. Thus, there have been many studies focused on improving cell viability upon implantation. We used severe oxidative stress to select for a mouse mesoangioblast subpopulation in vitro and found that this subpopulation retained self-renewal and myogenic differentiation capacities while notably enhancing cell survival, proliferation and migration relative to unselected cells. Additionally, this subpopulation of cells presented different resistance and recovery properties upon oxidative stress treatment, demonstrating select advantages over parental mesoangioblasts in our experimental analysis. Specifically, the cells were resistant to oxidative environments, demonstrating survival, continuous self-renewal and improved migration capability. The primary outcome of the selected cells was determined in in vivo experiments in which immunocompromised dystrophic mice were injected intramuscularly in the tibialis anterior with selected or non-selected mesoangioblasts. Resistant mesoangioblasts exhibited markedly enhanced survival and integration into the host skeletal muscle, accounting for a more than 70% increase in engraftment compared with that of the unselected mesoangioblast cell population and leading to remarkable muscle recovery. Thus, the positive effects of sorting on mesoangioblast cell behaviour in vitro and in vivo suggest that a selection step involving oxidative stress preconditioning may provide a novel methodology to select for resistant cells for use in regenerative tissue applications to prevent high mortality rates upon transplantation.
