Interprofessional collaboration might improve healthcare processes and outcomes; however, it has been found that most instruments that aim to measure collaboration have undergone limited testing. The assessment of interprofessional team collaboration scale (AITCS) is one questionnaire that aims to evaluate collaboration, but it has not yet been extensively tested. The aim of this study was to translate and to cross-culturally adapt the AITCS for use in Sweden, to describe floor and ceiling values, and to investigate the AITCS in terms of reliability, face, and content validity. The study included a total of 349 participants working in team-based pain rehabilitation. The participants were asked to fill in the Swedish version of the AITCS (AITCS-S) at baseline. Of these, 73 participants also completed the AITCS-S two weeks later. The results showed that the content and face validity were good. Internal consistency varied from 0.79 to 0.96 and judged to be acceptable to excellent. Testâ€“retest stability showed excellent stability with intraclass correlation values above 0.75 for all subscales. This study concludes that the Swedish version of the AITCS is a reliable and valid questionnaire. Further psychometric investigations might be undertaken in order to attempt to develop shorter versions of the AITCS-S.
