The separation of sister chromatids is a crucial step in cell division and is triggered by the activation of separase, a protease that cleaves the proteins that maintain the cohesion between sister chromatids. Knowledge of the molecular structure and activation mechanism of separase is limited by the difficulty of obtaining structural information on this large and flexible protein. Sequence conservation between separase homologues from diverse species is limited to the C-terminal region that contains the catalytically active protease domain. We conducted an in-depth bioinformatical analysis of separase and generated structural models of the two conserved domains that comprise the C-terminal region: a caspase-like domain and a putative death domain. This analysis provided insights into substrate recognition and identified potential sites of protein-protein interactions. Both the death domain and caspase-like domain are well-conserved in separases, which suggests an evolutionary pressure to keep these two domains together, perhaps to enable separase activity and/or provide stability. Insights into the molecular structures of separase gained in this study may provide a starting point for experimental structural studies on this protein and may aid therapeutic development against cancers where chromosomes are improperly segregated.
