Before anaphase onset, the presence of securin Pds1 prevents the cleavage of cohesin, a protein complex that holds sister chromatids together, but the degradation of Pds1 leads to robust cohesion dissolution, resulting in synchronous separation of all chromosomes. Since sister chromatids are attached to spindle microtubules before anaphase onset, spindle elongation segregates sister chromatids to each daughter cell after cohesion dissolution. A fundamental question is how spindle elongation is temporally regulated in order to coordinate with sister chromatid separation. Cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) play a key role in the cell cycle, and it is well established that S-phase CDK promotes DNA synthesis. We found that hyperactive S-phase CDK delays spindle elongation in budding yeast, while hyperactive mitotic CDK leads to premature spindle elongation. We further provide evidence indicating that mitotic CDK promotes spindle elongation by activating a protein phosphatase that antagonizes S-phase CDK, thus the balance of S-phase and mitotic CDK controls the timing of spindle elongation. Interestingly, hyperactive mitotic CDK induces uncoupled spindle elongation and sister chromatid separation in the absence of securin, suggesting that the temporal control of spindle elongation and cohesin cleavage is essential for faithful chromosome segregation.
