Changes in gene regulation have long been known to play important roles in both innate and adaptive immune responses. While transcriptional responses to infection have been well-characterized, much less is known about the extent to which co-transcriptional mechanisms of mRNA processing are involved in the regulation of immune defenses. In this study, we sought to investigate the role of mRNA processing in the cellular responses of human macrophages to live bacterial infection. Using primary human macrophages derived from whole blood samples from 60 individuals, we sequenced mRNA both before and after infection with two live bacteria. We show that immune responses to infection are accompanied by pervasive changes in mRNA isoform usage, with systematic shifts towards increased cassette exon inclusion and shortening of Tandem 3’ UTRs post-infection. These patterns are conserved in nonhuman primates, supporting their functional importance across evolutionary time. Complementary microRNA profiling revealed that shortened 3’ UTRs are enriched for target sites of macrophage-expressed miRNAs, many of which are specifically activated after infection to regulate the innate immune response. Our results therefore provide the first genome-wide empirical support for the idea that actively regulated shifts towards shorter 3’ UTRs might allow specific genes to evade repression by immune-activated miRNAs.
