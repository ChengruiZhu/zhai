Brain signals often show a stimulus-induced rhythm in the “gamma” band (30–80 Hz) whose magnitude depends on attentional load, leading to suggestions that gamma rhythm plays a functional role in routing signals across cortical areas. However, gamma power also depends on simple stimulus features such as size or contrast, which suggests that gamma could arise from basic cortical processes involving excitation–inhibition interactions. One such process is divisive normalization, a mechanism that suppresses the response of a neuron by the overall activity of a large pool of neighboring neurons. Recent studies have shown that attention increases the strength of both excitation and normalization. We hypothesized that the increase in gamma power in an attention task is due to the effect of attention on excitation and normalization. By manipulating the normalization strength independent of attentional load in macaque monkeys, we show that gamma power increases with increasing normalization, even when attentional load is held fixed. Thus, gamma rhythms could be a reflection of changes in the relative strengths of excitation and normalization rather than playing a functional role in communication or control.
