The management of attention is central to animal behaviour and a central theme of study in both neuroscience and psychology. Attention is usually studied in the visual system (most often using cats or primates) owing to the ease of generating controlled visual stimuli and of measuring its expression through eye movement. In this study, we develop a model of the expression of attention in another sensory modality, that served by the tactile whiskers of small mammals (such as rats and mice). This sensory system has long been a popular model in neuroscience and is well characterised. It has become recognised in recent years that the modulations of whisker movements prevalent in the behaving animal represent “active sensing” (in the sense of moving the sensors to optimise sensing performance), yet a unified understanding of these modulations is still lacking. Our model proposes just such a unified understanding, suggesting that whisker movement modulations can be understood as an overt expression of the animal's changing focus of attention. This proposal, therefore, offers to provide both an enhanced understanding of the whisker sensory system and an insight into the management of attention in these animals.
