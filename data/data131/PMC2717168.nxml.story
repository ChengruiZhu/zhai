The authors examined 1,615 workers exposed to dioxins in trichlorophenol production in Midland, Michigan, to determine if there were increased mortality rates from exposure. Historical dioxin levels were estimated by a serum survey of workers. Vital status was followed from 1942 to 2003, and cause-specific death rates and trends with exposure were evaluated. All cancers combined (standardized mortality ratio (SMR) = 1.0, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.8, 1.1), lung cancers (SMR = 0.7, 95% CI: 0.5, 0.9), and nonmalignant respiratory disease (SMR = 0.8, 95% CI: 0.6, 1.0) were at or below expected levels. Observed deaths for leukemia (SMR = 1.9, 95% CI: 1.0, 3.2), non-Hodgkin lymphoma (SMR = 1.3, 95% CI: 0.6, 2.5), diabetes (SMR = 1.1, 95% CI: 0.6, 1.8), and ischemic heart disease (SMR = 1.1, 95% CI: 0.9, 1.2) were slightly greater than expected. No trend was observed with exposure for these causes of death. However, for 4 deaths of soft tissue sarcoma (SMR = 4.1, 95% CI: 1.1, 10.5), the mortality rates increased with exposure. The small number of deaths and the uncertainty in both diagnosis and nosology coding make interpretation of this finding tenuous. With the exception of soft tissue sarcoma, the authors found little evidence of increased disease risk from exposure to 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-
