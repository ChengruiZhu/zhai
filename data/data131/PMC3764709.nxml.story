This study aims at examining the clinical impact, of antibodies detected on an ELISA mixed antigen tray format (LATM, One Lambda) in the absence of complement dependent cytotoxicity (CDC) positivity. All patients who underwent renal transplantation in 2007 and 2008 had their final pre-transplant sera retrospectively analyzed by the LATM assay. These patients were then followed-up with clinical, biochemical, and histopathological end points defined by elevation of serum creatinine and/or histopathological criteria. Among 164 patients who were studied, 149 received grafts from live related donors and 15, from deceased donors. 31 (19%) of the transplanted patients demonstrated pre-transplant anti-HLA IgG antibodies on the assay. Totally, 15 were positive for class I antibodies, 4 for class II antibodies, and 12 for both class I and class II antibodies. 44 patients (36%) experienced rejection. 8 out of 31 (26%) ELISA positive patients and 36 out of 133 (27%) ELISA negative patients experienced rejection. Among 15 patients who received deceased donor transplants, 4 were positive for ELISA, and 11 were negative. All 4 (100%) of the ELISA positive patients experienced rejection as compared to 3 out of 11 (27%) ELISA negative patients (
