The aim of the present study was to investigate mechanism of the gender differences of B cells. The results showed that 358 differential gene expressions (DEGs) were displayed between healthy females and males. Compared with male, 226 and 132 genes were found to be up- and downregulated in the female. 116 genes displayed possible correlation with estrogen. Moreover, the upregulated DEGs (Cav1, CD200R1, TNFRSF17, and CXCR3) and downregulated DEGs (EIF1AY and DDX3Y) in healthy female may be involved in gender predominance of some immune diseases. Furthermore, signaling pathway analysis for estrogen-relevant DEGs showed that only 26 genes were downregulated in SLE female versus SLE male, of which expressions of 8 genes had significant difference between SLE females and SLE males but are having nonsignificant difference between healthy females and healthy males. Except for the 5 Y-chromosome-related genes or varients, only 3 DEGs (LTF, CAMP, and DEFA4) were selected and qRT-PCR confirmed that the expressions of LTF and CAMP decreased significantly in B cells from female SLE patients. These data indicated that the gender differences were existent in global gene expression of B cells and the difference may be related to estrogen.
