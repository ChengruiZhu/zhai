One of the hallmarks of cancer is uncontrolled cellular proliferation, and therefore many anti-cancer drugs aim to disrupt cancer proliferation. However, some of these drugs (e.g., chemotherapeutic agents) affect normal proliferating cells as well, resulting in undesirable side effects. Understanding the differences between cancerous and non-cancerous proliferation can help us design new selective drugs that kill cancer cells without harming normal cells. In this work, we use genome scale gene expression and growth rate measurements across 60 cancer cell lines (NCI-60) to uncover genetic determinants of cancerous proliferation. In parallel, gene expression and growth rate measurements of non-cancerous cell lines allow us to uncover determinants of non-cancerous proliferation. Notably, we find marked differences between the cancerous and non-cancerous proliferation. The two proliferation signatures can be used jointly to enhance the prediction of patient outcome in cancer. Notably, we find that certain genes in the translation and spliceosome machineries are involved in cancerous proliferation but not in non-cancerous proliferation, highlighting them as putative selective anti-cancer drug targets.
