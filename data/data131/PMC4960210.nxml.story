Neurolymphomatosis (NL) defined as infiltration of the central nervous system or the peripheral nervous system (PNS) by malignant lymphoma cells is a rare clinical entity. However, the increasing use of fluorodeoxyglucose positron-emission tomography (FDG-PET) and magnetic resonance imaging in evaluating PNS disorders is resulting in; this condition being recognized more frequently. Here; we report five NL patients and review the current literature. We report five patients with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) and NL, all of whom were men aged 47â€“69 years. The clinical presentation varied from symmetrical peripheral neuropathy to mononeuropathy. Peripheral neuropathy was the presenting manifestation of a systemic lymphoma in two patients (40%). Neuroimaging as well as whole-body FDG-PET helped in determining the correct diagnosis in all of the patients. NL is an unusual presentation of NHL resulting from infiltration of the PNS by malignant lymphomatous cells. While evaluating peripheral neuropathy, a high degree of suspicion of NL is required since the presenting symptoms vary, conventional radiology has only modest sensitivity, and a pathological diagnosis is often difficult. FDG-PET helps in the early diagnosis and treatment of this condition.
