Elucidating the link between the rise of planetary oxygen and biological evolution is a challenging topic in evolutionary biology. Previous studies in this area were dominated by biological investigations. The recent simulations of metabolic networks under anaerobic or aerobic conditions revealed that aerobic metabolism gave rise to 1,000+ new reactions. Since metabolites are small molecules and metabolic reactions are basically chemical reactions, we think that the impact of oxygen on metabolic evolution can be well studied by chemoinformatics. In this paper, we use chemoinformatic methods to perform a comprehensive comparative analysis of the chemical structures, properties and reactions of anaerobic and aerobic metabolites. It was found that aerobic metabolism has considerably expanded the structural space of metabolites by inventing 130 novel molecular scaffolds. Moreover, aerobic metabolism also helped organisms to explore a new chemical space by increasing the hydrophobicity and rigidity of metabolites. Since hydrophobic metabolites are fitting to modulate membrane functions and to serve as transmembrane signaling factors, these metabolic innovations definitely benefit the establishment of complex cellular organizations. The present findings not only help to understand the molecular link between oxygen and evolution but also suggest that chemoinformatics is of special value in addressing some basic biological questions.
