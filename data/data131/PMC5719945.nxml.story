The main purpose of this work was to quantify patient organ doses from the two kilovoltage cone beam computed tomography (CBCT) systems currently available on medical linear accelerators, namely the X‐ray Volumetric Imager (XVI, Elekta Oncology Systems) and the On‐Board Imager (OBI, Varian Medical Systems). Organ dose measurements were performed using a fiber‐optic coupled (FOC) dosimetry system along with an adult male anthropomorphic phantom for three different clinically relevant scan sites: head, chest, and pelvis. The FOC dosimeter was previously characterized at diagnostic energies by Hyer et al. [Med Phys 2009;36(5):1711–16] and a total uncertainty of approximately 4% was found for in‐phantom dose measurements. All scans were performed using current manufacturer‐installed clinical protocols and appropriate bow‐tie filters. A comparison of image quality between these manufacturer‐installed protocols was also performed using a Catphan 440 image quality phantom. Results indicated that for the XVI, the dose to the lens of the eye (1.07 mGy) was highest in a head scan, thyroid dose (19.24 mGy) was highest in a chest scan, and gonad dose (29 mGy) was highest in a pelvis scan. For the OBI, brain dose (3.01 mGy) was highest in a head scan, breast dose (5.34 mGy) was highest in a chest scan, and gonad dose (34.61 mGy) was highest in a pelvis scan. Image quality measurements demonstrated that the OBI provided superior image quality for all protocols, with both better spatial resolution and low‐contrast detectability. The measured organ doses were also used to calculate a reference male effective dose to allow further comparison of the two machines and imaging protocols. The head, chest, and pelvis scans yielded effective doses of 0.04, 7.15, and 3.73 mSv for the XVI, and 0.12, 1.82, and 4.34 mSv for the OBI, respectively.
