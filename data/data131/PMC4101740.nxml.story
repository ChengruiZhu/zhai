We evaluated the efficacy of using standard radiologic and histologic criteria to guide the follow-up of patients with lobular carcinoma in situ (LCIS), lobular neoplasia (LN), or atypical lobular hyperplasia (ALH). Patients with high-risk benign lesions diagnosed on biopsy were presented and reviewed in a multidisciplinary clinical management conference from 1 November 2003 through September 2011. Associations between patient characteristics and rates of upgrade were determined by univariate and multivariate logistic models, and times to diagnosis carcinoma were calculated. Of 853 cases reviewed, 124 (14.5%) were lobular neoplasms. In all, 104 patients were clinically and/or radiographically monitored. In 20 patients, who were found to have LN on core biopsy and were recommended to have immediate surgical excision, a more significant lesion was identified in 8 (40%) of the excised specimens. Factors associated with a more significant lesion on excisional biopsy included whether the lobular lesion had been targeted for biopsy and whether the extent of disease involved three or more terminal duct lobular units. Of the 104 patients radiographically and clinically monitored, the median follow-up time was 3.4 years with a range of 0.44â€“8.6 years. Five patients under surveillance were subsequently diagnosed with breast malignancy (three of the five at a site unrelated to the initial biopsy). Patients with incidental lobular lesions identified on percutaneous core needle biopsy have a small risk of upgrade and may not require an excisional biopsy. Clinical management of low-volume lobular lesions in a multidisciplinary setting is an efficacious alternative to surgical excision when radiologic and histologic characteristics are well-defined.
