It is recognized that IL‐18 is related to development of asthma, but role of IL‐18 in asthma remains controversial and confusing. This is largely due to lack of information on expression of IL‐18 binding protein (BP) and IL‐18 receptor (R) in asthma. In this study, we found that plasma levels of IL‐18 and IL‐18BP were elevated in asthma. The ratio between plasma concentrations of IL‐18 and IL‐18BP was 1:12.8 in asthma patients. We demonstrated that 13‐fold more monocytes, 17.5‐fold more neutrophils and 4.1‐fold more B cells express IL‐18BP than IL‐18 in asthmatic blood, suggesting that there is excessive amount of IL‐18BP to abolish actions of IL‐18 in asthma. We also discovered that more IL‐18R+ monocytes, neutrophils and B cells are located in asthmatic blood. Once injected, IL‐18 eliminated IL‐18R+ monocytes in blood, but up‐regulated expression of IL‐18R in lung macrophages of OVA‐sensitized mice. Our data clearly indicate that the role of IL‐18 in asthma is very likely to be determined by balance of IL‐18/IL‐18BP/IL‐18R expression in inflammatory cells. Therefore, IL‐18R blocking or IL‐18BP activity enhancing therapies may be useful for treatment of asthma.
