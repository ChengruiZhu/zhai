Understanding how the brain represents and processes stimuli requires a quantitative understanding of how signals propagate through networks of neurons. Developing such an understanding is made difficult by the dense interconnectivity of neurons, especially in the cerebral cortex. One approach to quantifying neural processing in the cortex is derived from observations that excitatory (positive) and inhibitory (negative) interactions between neurons tend to balance each other in many brain areas. This balance is achieved under a class of computational models called “balanced networks.” However, previous approaches to the mathematical analysis of balanced network models is not possible under some biologically relevant connectivity structures. We show that, under these structures, balance between excitation and inhibition is necessarily broken and the resulting imbalance causes some stimulus features to be amplified. This “imbalanced amplification” of stimuli can explain several observations from recordings in mouse somatosensory and visual cortical circuits and provides fundamental insights into the relationship between connectivity structure and neural responses in cortical circuits.
