Glaucoma is a leading cause of irreversible blindness worldwide. The reduction of intraocular pressure has been well established as an effective treatment to prevent both the development and the progression of all forms of glaucoma. Bimatoprost 0.03% ophthalmic solution, introduced in 2001, is a synthetic prostamide with the unique mechanism of improving both uveoscleral and trabecular outflow. Comparative studies with other pharmacotherapies have shown favorable results for bimatoprost as a potent ocular hypotensive agent that is generally well tolerated. Common side effects include conjunctival hyperemia, eyelash growth, iris pigmentation and periorbital changes. Hyperemia rates were reduced following the introduction of bimatoprost 0.01%. Bimatoprost should be used with caution in those with higher risk of developing ocular inflammation and macular edema. However, the perceived risk of bimatoprost in these patient populations is likely greater than the actual risk observed in practice. Bimatoprost is currently in the center of several clinical trials including its use for dermatologic applications and sustained-release therapies for the treatment of ocular hypertension and glaucoma.
