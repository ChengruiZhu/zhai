Hyaluronidase is a goat testicular protein that hydrolyzes hyaluronic acid, a structural component of the intercellular matrix. It is commonly used as a spreading factor to improve the diffusion of drugs, including local anesthetics and chemotherapeutics. We experienced a 55-yr-old female with generalized urticaria that developed within 1 hr after the epidural injection of hyaluronidase. She had a history of allergic rhinitis, and had suffered from post-herpetic neuralgia and a herniated disc for several years. To relieve her pain, she had been given epidural injections consisting of mepivacaine hydrochloride, triamcinolone acetonide, and morphine sulfate biweekly for one year. Hyaluronidase had been administered several times with these drugs before this episode of generalized urticaria. Skin prick testing showed a positive response to 1,500 IU/mL of hyaluronidase extract, as compared to histamine. The patient's serum hyaluronidase-specific IgE level, determined using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), was markedly elevated, as compared to unexposed healthy controls. An IgE immunoblot analysis using hyaluronidase extract and the patient's serum showed IgE binding components at 31 and 21 kDa, whereas no corresponding IgE binding component was found in healthy controls. An ELISA inhibition test showed significant, dose-dependent inhibition with the serial addition of hyaluronidase extract. This is the first case of an IgE-medicated allergic reaction to goat (
