A 30 year-old male professional dancer presented with pain, effusion and severe instability in his left knee after falling in a dance event. The pain was evaluated on Visual analog scale (VAS) as 6 to 8. At the physical examination, anterior drawer test was evaluated as grade 3, pivot shift test, varus test, dial test and posterolateral drawer test were found positive. The Tegner Lysholm score was evaluated as 22 (poor). Under general anesthesia, left knee had tendency to external rotation and recurvatum when leg was suspended by toes. A magnetic resonance image (MRI) revealed the presence of a total ACL rupture, PLC injury and a fracture of lateral tibia plateau. The patient was treated with arthroscopic reconstruction of ACL with ipsilateral hamstring tendon graft fixed with endobutton through femoral tunnel and bio interference screw through tibial tunnel and PLC injury was treated with 2 suture anchors. Postoperatively first day, quadriceps musculature and active and passive ROM exercises was trained. During postoperatively third week, the patient was allowed to mobilize nonweight bearing with the use of two crutches without functional knee brace. At the sixth week, arthroscopic lysis was performed due to type 3 arthrofibrosis. At the tenth week, manipulation was performed to the left knee under general anesthesia.
