Influenza A is a rapidly evolving virus with genome composed of eight distinct RNA molecules called segments. This genetic structure allows formation of new combinations of segments when a cell is coinfected by multiple viral strains, in a process called reassortment. While “antigenic drift” – the process of continuous accumulation of point mutations that change the antigenic properties of the viral proteins – is mainly responsible for the seasonal flu, the heaviest pandemics were caused by spread of novel reassortant strains and the associated radical “antigenic shift”. However, the association between these two types of processes has not been studied systematically. Here, we use the extensive available complete-genome sequencing data for Influenza A H3N2 subtype to infer the evolutionary timings of within-subtype reassortment events, and study the patterns of point amino acid-changing replacements that followed reassortments. We find that reassortments were often rapidly followed by replacements, which possibly compensated for the loss of fitness associated with the reassortment or explored newly accessible fitness peaks. These findings may be relevant for prediction of future pandemic strains of Influenza A.
