Tunneling nanotubes (TNTs) are F-actin-based membrane tubes, and can form between cultured cells and within vital tissues. TNTs mediate intercellular communications that range from electrical signaling to the transfer of organelles. Following peripheral nerve injury, the orchestrated intercellular communications among neural and non-neural cells are required for effective nerve regeneration. It remains unknown whether TNTs exist between neural cells in the peripheral nerve system and how TNTs affect neural regeneration. To address these interesting questions, we investigated the transfer of neurotropic factors, membrane protein, cytoplasmic protein, mitochondria and RNA in functional TNTs formed between cultured Schwann cells (SCs). TNT-like structures were increased not only in cultured SCs after exposure to serum depletion but also in longitudinal sections of proximal sciatic nerve stump harvested after rat peripheral nerve transection. Meanwhile, downregulation of Rab8a or Rab11a in cultured SCs inhibited the formation of functional TNTs and vesicle transfer and led to decrease in cell migration, increase in SCs apoptosis. Likewise, knockdown of Rab8a or Rab11a in primary SCs also suppressed axonal outgrowth from co-cultured dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons. Overall, our results suggested that the gene of Rab8a or Rab11a might be involved in the formation of TNTs structures in the peripheral nerve system, while TNTs structures were likely to affect peripheral nerve regeneration through the regulation of neural cell communications.
