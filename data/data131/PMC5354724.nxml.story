 exotoxin A (PE) to the cytosol where it inhibits protein synthesis. Here we demonstrate that maximal doses of RG7787 temporarily halt growth of pancreatic cancer tumor xenografts, similar to the approved drugs gemcitabine and nab-paclitaxel, however, combination of the RIT with nab-paclitaxel produces durable complete regressions in most mice. Synergy between taxane and anti-MSLN RITs has been previously demonstrated in mouse models, but direct interaction of the combination in cell culture was not observed. Here, we show that this favorable interaction occurs in cell culture, is dependent on the dose and duration of RG7787 exposure, requires the catalytically active PE, and still occurs with RIT targeting a non-MSLN surface antigen. Unexpectedly, the combination does not increase RG7787-mediated protein synthesis inhibition nor perturb downstream apoptotic markers of RIT-mediated killing, but does augment levels of acetylated tubulin, a marker of taxane activity. Taken together, these data suggest that PE increases cell sensitivity to taxane-mediated killing by increasing taxane-mediated microtubule stability and priming cells for apoptosis by decreasing levels of the pro-survival factor Mcl-1.
