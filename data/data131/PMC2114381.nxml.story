Catecholamines were found to activate Na/H exchange in a concentration- dependent manner in primary cultures of vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMC). The potency order was found to be epinephrine greater than norepinephrine greater than isoproterenol. The major pathway for catecholamine effects appeared to be via interaction with an alpha 1 adrenergic receptor. In addition, it was found that alpha 1 receptor- mediated Na/H exchange in VSMC was increased by angiotensin II and inhibited by 12-O-tetradecanoyl phorbol-13-acetate (TPA). Adrenergic receptors have been shown to be coupled to both adenylate cyclase and to inositol phosphate release (Leeb-Lundberg, L. M. F., S. Cotecchia, J. W. Lomasney, J. F. DeBernadis, R. J. Lefkowitz, and M. G. Caron, 1985, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 82:5651-5655.). It was found that catecholamines increased AMP levels in the potency order isoproterenol greater than norepinephrine greater than epinephrine and the receptor involved was a beta adrenergic receptor. Since these findings did not parallel the results obtained for catecholamine stimulation of Na/H exchange, an increase in AMP levels was probably not the mechanism by which major pathway for catecholamine-stimulated Na/H exchange in VSMC (via the alpha 1 receptor) was activated. When the effects of catecholamines were measured on inositol phosphate release, the potency order for catecholamine stimulation was epinephrine greater than norepinephrine greater than isoproterenol, and the receptor involved was an alpha 1 adrenergic receptor. In addition, angiotensin II increased and TPA inhibited catecholamine-stimulated inositol phosphate release. Since these findings paralleled the results obtained for catecholamine stimulation of Na/H exchange, inositol phosphate release may be the mechanism by which the major pathway for catecholamine- stimulated Na/H exchange in VSMC (via the alpha 1 receptor) was activated.
