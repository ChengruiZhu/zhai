Cervical cancer, the third most commonly occurring cancer, is the second leading cause of cancer related mortality among women. Aberrant ubiquitination and proteasome activity, both human papillomavirus and tumor derived, have been shown to contribute to tumor angiogenesis, proliferation, and invasion in many cancers, including cervical cancer. Thus, small molecule proteasome inhibitors are a potential and strategic treatment option for cervical cancer. In this study, novel proteasome inhibitor delanzomib (CEP-18770) exhibited potent pro-apoptotic and cytotoxic effects on a panel of cervical cancer cell lines by blocking proteasomal activity. Delanzomib also significantly sensitized cervical cancer cells to treatment of doxorubicin (Dox), a traditional chemotherapeutic agent. Furthermore, proteasome inhibition revealed stabilization of p53 and p53 transcriptional targets and induction of p38/JNK phosphorylation. Additionally, delanzomib worked synergistically with Dox to further upregulate p53 and its downstream targets and enhanced Dox-induced p38 phosphorylation. Our study strongly supports the 26S proteasome as a potential therapeutic target in cervical cancer and proteasome inhibition by delanzomib may be a potential treatment strategy for cervical cancer patients.
