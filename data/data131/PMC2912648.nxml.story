HIV-1 is responsible for millions of deaths every year by causing acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). Therefore, research is ongoing in order to better understand and counter HIV-1 infection. Like any virus, HIV-1 must enter host cells and use cellular machinery to replicate. To do this, proteins of the virus interact with the proteins of the cell. Many studies have identified specific virus-host protein interactions and a database known as the HIV-1, Human Protein Interaction Database was created for reference and further study to understand HIV-1 infection. In this work, we use the HHPID to find significant patterns of HIV-host interaction in order to identify core processes that are active during infection and also to highlight host cellular subsystems that are affected by HIV-1. We discuss the importance of these subsystems and associated interactionsâ€”in particular, whether the host proteins are supported by other recent data sets that were designed to find host factors essential for HIV-1 replication. We highlight mechanisms from essential steps in the viral life cycle as well as perturbations of the host immune response. Our work provides an accessible insight into HIV-1 infection.
