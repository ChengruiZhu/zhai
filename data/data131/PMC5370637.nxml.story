Despite the lack of a definitive information about the seasonal predilection of prosthetic joint infections, Kane et al showed a significantly increased incidence of infection in summer months among 750 patients operated with arthroplasty, of whom 17 suffered such infection (15). In contrast, among 174 prosthetic joint infections, we found no significant monthly and/or seasonal difference in the incidence of prosthetic joint infections.Increased moisture and temperature increase bacterial colonization both in the outer environment and on the hostâ€™s skin, increasing the sensitivity to infections. Perspiration of the host, closed environmental conditions, and increased moisture are other important factors promoting bacterial colonization (16,17). However, appropriate care of the surgical field following surgery is the most important factor reducing bacterial colonization of skin. Another significant problem with arthroplasty surgery is patient satisfaction, which is promoted by as short as possible waiting times from the time of decision to operate to the time of procedure.In conclusion, the incidence of prosthetic joint infections is not increased after arthroplasty operation in summer when bacterial colonization is promoted by increased temperature and moisture. Therefore, season does not appear as a risk factor.
