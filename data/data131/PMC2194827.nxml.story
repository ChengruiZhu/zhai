 Observations have been made upon a typical flexor reflex with the aim of disclosing the changes in amount, latency, and temporal configuration of reflex discharge that take place as afferent input is varied from zero to maximal for the band of cutaneous myelinated afferent fibers that extends upward from approximately 6 Âµ in diameter (group II fibers). Reflex threshold is reached at 6 to 12 per cent maximal afferent input. From threshold to maximal input the relation between input and amount of output is essentially linear, latency on the average decreases, the shorter central paths in general gain preference, but the known minimum pathway, one of three neurons, does not transmit unless aided by convergent activity. Flexor reflex discharge may occur in several bursts suggesting the existence of closed chain connections in the internuncial pools of the spinal cord. At any given input there is, in successively elicited reflexes, little correlation between latency and amount of discharge, at first sight a surprising result for each variable can be taken as a measure of excitability status of the motoneuron population. However, latency of discharge indicates excitability at the beginning of the reflex event whereas amount of discharge is an expression of excitability over the entire period of discharge. Given a constantly and rapidly fluctuating excitability absence of correlation between these variables would be an anticipated result.
