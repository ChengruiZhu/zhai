Dermatomyositis is an idiopathic inflammatory myopathy that cause skin and muscle complications. The ethiology is not understood well yet. Released cytokines including interferon and interleukins are suggested to make inflammatory responses in the skin or muscle. Muscle weakness and skin lesions including heliotrope rash, shawl sign and Gottronâ€™s papules are the most common symptoms. A biopsy (muscle or skin) is always the most reliable method for diagnosis. Corticosteroids in association with immunosuppressive agents are used as standard treatment. The patient was a 30 years old woman who got involved with dermatomyositis for 10 years. She has been under therapy with Methotrexate, Prednisolon and Azathioprine until she came to us suffering from progressive skin lesions. Experiments and examinations were normal except the lesions and detected lipoatrophy. Because of immune cells infiltration and observations necrotizing vasculitis was diagnosed. After three month of high dose prednisolon and intravenous cyclophosphamide therapy the lesions vanished remarkable. True and immediate diagnosis gives physicians the chance not only to assess the best treatment but have adequate time to apply the procedure. However shortening the therapy and diminishing morbidity of the disease need more investigations and efforts.
