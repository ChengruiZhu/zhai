In this retrospective cohort study with medium term followup of 3 procedures performed by 6 knee surgeons, patients were highly matched by virtue of gender (male), age (<55 years), activity level (Tegner scores), pathology (isolated medial compartment OA). Regarding survivorship of the index procedure, the outcome for Osteotomy was poor with 58% at 10 yrs and high reoperation/complication rate of 50% at mean 4.8 years. The best survivorship/reoperation rates were in the UKA group (99% and 4% respectively). Regarding patient reported outcome using Forgotten Joint Score, comparison between all groups favoured UKA. The comparison between UKA and Osteotomy was so powerful, as to render the p value almost unmeasureable (0.00001). Unrevised Osteotomy patients reported disappointing duration of benefit (mean 3.1 years), and low FJS (mean 18), but hadnâ€™t sought further surgery. A further example that revision rates are not a good indicator of outcome, especially for Osteotomy. Our study demonstrates that at medium term followup, cementless Oxford UKA provides the best outcome with respect to patient satisfaction, function and survivorship compared to Osteotomy and TKA in men under 55 yrs with medial compartment osteoarthritis.
