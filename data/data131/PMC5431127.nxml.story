Sanguinarine, a bioactive benzophenanthridine alkaloid extracted from plants of the Papaveraceae family, has shown antitumour effects in multiple cancer cells. But the therapeutic effects and regulatory mechanisms of sanguinatine in gastric cancer (GC) remain elusive. This study was aimed to investigate the correlation of dual‐specificity phosphatase 4 (DUSP4) expression with clinicopathologic features and overall survival in patients with GC and explore the effects of sanguinarine on tumour growth and invasion in GC cells (SGC‐7901 and HGC‐27) and underlying molecular mechanisms. Immunohistochemical analysis showed that decreased DUSP4 expression was associated with the sex, tumour size, depth of invasion and distant metastasis in patients with GC. Functional experiments including CCK‐8, Transwell and flow cytometry analysis indicated that sanguinarine or DUSP4 overexpression inhibited GC cell viability and invasive potential, and induced cell apoptosis and cycle arrest in S phase, but DUSP4 knockdown attenuated the antitumour activity of sanguinarine. Further observation demonstrated that sanguinarine up‐regulated the expression of DUSP4 and Bcl‐2‐associated X protein (Bax), but down‐regulated phosphorylated extracellular signal‐regulated kinase (p‐ERK), proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA), matrix metalloproteinase 2 (MMP‐2) and B‐cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl‐2) expression. Taken together, our findings indicate that sanguinarine inhibits growth and invasion of GC cells through regulation of the DUSP4/ERK pathway, suggesting that sanguinarine may have potential for use in GC treatment.
