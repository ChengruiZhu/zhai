In the context of obesity, perivascular fat produces various adipokines and releases free fatty acids, which may induce inflammation and proliferation in the vascular wall. In this study we investigated how adipokines, oleic acid (OA) and the combined treatment regulate human vascular smooth muscle cell (hVSMC) proliferation and migration and the underlying signalling pathways. Adipocyte-conditioned media (CM) generated from human adipocytes induces a prominent proliferation and migration of hVSMC. Autocrine action of adiponectin totally abolishes CM-induced proliferation. Furthermore, OA but not palmitic acid induces proliferation of hVSMC. CM itself does not contain fatty acids, but CM in combination with OA markedly enhances proliferation of hVSMC in a synergistic way. Both the nuclear factor (NF)-ÎºB and the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway were synergistically activated under these conditions and found to be essential for hVSMC proliferation. Expression of iNOS and production of nitric oxide was only enhanced by combined treatment inducing a marked release of VEGF. Combination of OA and VEGF induces an additive increase of hVSMC proliferation. We could show that the combination of CM and OA led to a synergistic proliferation of hVSMC. Expression of iNOS and production of nitric oxide were only enhanced under these conditions and were paralleled by a marked release of VEGF. These results suggest that the combined elevated release of fatty acids and adipokines by adipose tissue in obesity might be critically related to hVSMC dysfunction, vascular inflammation and the development of atherosclerosis.
