 gene. Most children with AS exhibit developmental delay, movement disorders, speech impairment, and often autistic features. The Ube3A enzyme normally regulates the degradation of the synaptic protein Arc, and in its absence the resulting elevated levels of Arc weaken synaptic contacts, making it difficult to generate long-term potentiation (LTP) and to process and store memory. In this study, we show that increased levels of Arc disrupt brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) signaling through the TrkB receptor (which is important for both the induction and maintenance of LTP). We find that the association of the postsynaptic density protein PSD-95 with TrkB is critical for intact BDNF signaling, and that the high levels of Arc in AS interfere with BDNF-induced recruitment of postsynaptic density protein-95 (PSD-95) and other effectors to TrkB. By disrupting the interaction between Arc and PSD-95 with the novel cyclic peptidomimetic compound CN2097, we were able to restore BDNF signaling and improve the induction of LTP in a mouse model of AS. We propose that the disruption of TrkB receptor signaling at synapses contributes to the cognitive dysfunction that occurs in Angelman syndrome.
