 = 6386), were used for this study. The main outcome measurements were the levels of MenC polysaccharide(PS)-specific IgG and serum bactericidal antibodies (SBA) after routine immunization, 4–5 years after catch-up immunization or by natural immunity. There was an increasing persistence of PS-specific IgG and SBA with age in the catch-up immunized cohorts 4–5 years after their MenCC immunization (MenC PS-specific IgG, 0.25 µg/ml (95%CI: 0.19–0.31 µg/ml) at age 6 years, gradually increasing to 2.34 µg/ml,(95%CI: 1.70–3.32 µg/ml) at age 21–22 years). A comparable pattern was found for antibodies against the carrier protein in children immunized above 9 years of age. In case of vaccination before the age of 5 years, PS-specific IgG was rapidly lost. For all age-cohorts together, SBA seroprevalence (≥8) increased from 19.7% to 43.0% in the pre- and post-MenC introduction eras, respectively. In non-immunized adults the SBA seroprevalence was not significantly different between the pre- and post-MenC introduction periods, whereas PS-specific IgG was significantly lower in the post-MenC vaccination (GMT, age ≥25 years, 0.10 µg/ml) era compared to the pre-vaccination (GMT, age ≥25 years, 0.43 µg/ml) era.
