Relapse and metastasis are the main causes of unfavorable outcome in head and neck cancers. Whereas, understanding of the molecular background of these processes is far from being complete. Therefore, in this study we aimed to identify potential biomarker candidates of relapse and metastasis in laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma (LSCC) by combining the 2D electrophoresis based protein screen and immunohistochemical analysis of candidate proteins. We screened three groups of LSCC cell lines derived from primary tumors, recurrent tumors and metastases and identified seven proteins that differed significantly in relative abundance between the analyzed groups. Among the identified proteins were the heat shock proteins HSP60 and HSP70 that were significantly downregulated both in recurrences- and metastases-derived cell lines but not in primary tumor-derived cell lines. Moreover, we identified significant upregulation of the annexin V, calreticulin and the inorganic pyrophosphatase (PPA1) exclusively in the metastases-derived cell lines. As these upregulated proteins could potentially become novel biomarkers of metastasis, we have compared their abundance in primary tumor LSCC N(0) cases, primary tumor LSCC N(+) cases as well as in LSCC metastases N(+). Our results show an intense increase of cytoplasmic PPA1 abundance in the N(+) (
