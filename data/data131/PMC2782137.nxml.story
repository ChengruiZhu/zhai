Plants sense molecules originating from pathogens and turn on a battery of immune responses. Activation of immune responses is controlled by a complex network of signaling mechanisms. A traditional approach, knocking out one mechanism at a time, has revealed little about major parts of the signaling network involved in two forms of immunity, Effector-Triggered Immunity (ETI) and Pattern-Triggered Immunity (PTI). ETI and PTI are triggered by different types of pathogen molecules. By simultaneously knocking out four major signaling mechanisms in the network, we demonstrated that a common network comprised of the four signaling mechanisms accounts for most of ETI and PTI triggered by particular molecules. The common network was also important for another form of immunity. We also precisely measured how much each signaling mechanism contributes to ETI and PTI and studied how the signaling mechanisms work together. We found that signaling mechanisms work together synergistically in PTI, which may amplify the signal, while they back up one another in ETI to make the immune signaling highly resistant to pathogen attack (pathogens produce molecules that interfere with immune signaling). Therefore, different forms of plant immunity share the same signaling mechanisms, but they use the same mechanisms in very different ways.
