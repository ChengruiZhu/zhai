Gastrointestinal (GI) tumors are the most commonly diagnosed cancers worldwide and the second leading cause of cancer-related death. Endoscopy is the gold standard for diagnosis of GI cancers. Early diagnosis of GI tumors by endoscopy at the precancerous or early stage may decrease the prevalence and mortality rate of GI cancers. The preventive role of endoscopic interventions and the limitations of conventional white-light endoscopy have given rise to myriad innovations. Chromoendoscopy with dye injection can be used to detect lesions at an early stage. However, the prolonged procedure duration and steep learning curve are disadvantages of chromoendoscopy. Recent technological advances in imaging enhancement have enabled detection of GI lesions without the need for dye injection, using digital chromoendoscopy systems, of which flexible spectral-imaging color enhancement, narrow-band imaging, and I-Scan are the most frequently used. The combination of endoscopic image magnification and high-definition optical systems using digital endoscopic methods has increased the diagnostic value of endoscopy. The development of confocal laser endomicroscopy has also improved in vivo endoscopic diagnosis. This review focuses on the latest technological innovations in endoscopy.
