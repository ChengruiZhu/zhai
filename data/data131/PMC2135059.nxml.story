 Sulfonamide inhibitor has been demonstrated in extracts of fresh normal muscle, pancreas, and spleen of certain animals. When autolysis of tissues takes place the amount of inhibitor is greatly increased. Fresh liver from beef, rabbit, and guinea pig is free of active inhibitor, although inhibitor is demonstrable in autolysates of this tissue. Fresh rabbit kidney is likewise free of active inhibitor. Following acid hydrolysis extracts of fresh rabbit liver and kidney cause sulfonamide inhibition. Normal human urine contains little or no active inhibitor. However, upon acid hydrolysis, inhibitor is uniformly present. Sulfonamide inhibitor is present in some, but not all, sterile serous effusions occurring during certain diseases. Inhibitor was found uniformly in pus. None was found in blood serum. In certain species of bacteria the inhibitor is found in the cells only and is not demonstrable in the culture medium, whereas in other species, the inhibitor is found in the culture supernatant, and the cells themselves are relatively free. The development of sulfapyridine fastness in a strain of Pneumococcus Type I is accompanied by a greatly increased production of sulfonamide inhibitor.
