Two UV-spectrophotometric and one reverse phase high performance liquid chromatography methods have been developed for the simultaneous estimation of amlodipine besilate, losartan potassium and hydrochlorothiazide in tablet dosage form. The first UV spectrophotometric method was a determination using the simultaneous equation method at 236.5, 254 and 271 nm over the concentration range 5-25, 10-50 and 5-25 μg/ml for amlodipine besilate, losartan potassium and hydrochlorothiazide, respectively. The second UV method was a determination using the area under curve method at 231.5-241.5, 249-259 and 266-276 nm over the concentration range of 5-25, 5-25 and 10-50 μg/ml for amlodipine besilate, hydrochlorothiazide and losartan potassium, respectively. In reverse phase high performance liquid chromatography analysis is carried out using 0.025 M phosphate buffer (pH 3.7):acetonitrile (57:43 v/v) as the mobile phase and Kromasil C18 (4.6 mm i.d×250 mm) column as stationery phase with detection wavelength of 232 nm linearity was obtained in the concentration range of 2-14, 20-140 and 5-40 μg/ml for amlodipine besilate, losartan potassium and hydrochlorothiazide, respectively. Both UV-spectrophotometric and reverse phase high performance liquid chromatography methods were statistically validated and can be used for analysis of combined dose tablet formulation containing amlodipine besilate, losartan potassium and hydrochlorothiazide.
