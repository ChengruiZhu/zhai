Urokinase plasminogen activator receptor (PLAUR) has been implicated in a variety of physiological and pathological conditions. The multi-functionality of PLAUR is due to its capacity to interact with many co-receptors to regulate extracellular proteolysis and intracellular signaling. Recent reports are identifying novel functions of PLAUR which were not evident in the past; however, the molecular mechanisms of PLAUR signaling are not completely understood. Here, we have compared the transcriptomes of silencing control (sicon) and PLAUR silenced (PLAURsi) MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells on treatment with radiation. We isolated RNA from the cells, synthesized cDNA and measured the gene expression changes by microarray. We identified 24 downregulated and 53 upregulated genes, which were significantly (P-value < 0.005) affected by PLAUR silencing. Our analysis revealed 415 canonical pathways and 743 causal disease networks affected on silencing PLAUR. Transcriptomic changes and predicted pathways supported and consolidated some of the earlier understanding in the context of PLAUR signaling; including our recent observations in DNA damage and repair process. In addition, we have identified several novel pathways where PLAUR is implicated.
