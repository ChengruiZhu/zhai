Bone grafting allows reconstruction of the atrophied or destroyed alveolar process. In orthopaedics and traumatology allogeneic grafting has been used to restore defects of osseous tissue for over 60 years. In order to improve safety of the graft recipient, sterilized allogeneic grafts have been use. The aim of the study was to assess the direct and long-term outcomes following augmentation of atrophied alveolar processes with the use of radiation-sterilized allogeneic bone grafts. Sixty-eight patients were surgically treated between 2004 and 2011: 29 underwent open sinus floor elevation, post-extraction alveoli augmentation was performed in 16 subjects and 23 underwent reconstruction of the atrophied alveolar process. Augmentation of bone defects used bone granulate in 63 patients and bone blocks stabilized with titanium screws in 5 patients. PRF membranes collected from the patient’s blood were also used in all the procedures. In each of the cases optimal dimensions of the alveolar process were obtained allowing embedment of BIOMET 3I dental implant/-s. In all the patients the defects were successfully restored with implant-supported prostheses. Radiation-sterilized allogeneic bone grafts proved to be safe and effective for the patients and manageable for the surgeon constituting a good alternative to autogeneic material.
