The neural cell adhesion molecules, or N-CAMs, are a group of structurally and immunologically related glycoproteins found in vertebrate neural tissues. Adult brain N-CAMs have apparent molecular weights of 180,000, 140,000, and 120,000. In this article we identify, using monoclonal antibody (Mab) 3G6.41, an immunologically distinct adult rat N-CAM form and show that this form is selectively expressed by some clonal neural cell lines. Consecutive immunoprecipitation experiments indicate that rabbit anti-N-CAM can remove from solubilized cerebellar neuron primary cultures all 180,000- and 140,000-mol-wt N- CAM molecules that react with Mab 3G6.41. However Mab 3G6.41 cannot remove all N-CAM molecules that react with rabbit anti-N-CAM. Rabbit anti-N-CAM binds to and immunoprecipitates N-CAM forms from the rat neuronal cell lines B35, B65, and B104, the glial lines B12 and C6, and L6 myoblasts. Mab 3G6.41 does not bind to or immunoprecipitate N-CAM from the B12 and B65 lines but does react with the other four lines by both criteria. Many cells in primary cultures of postnatal rat that express glial fibrillary acidic protein also bind Mab 3G6.41. Thus a unique form of rat N-CAM recognized by Mab 3G6.41 is found on some but not all neuronal, glial, and muscle cells.
