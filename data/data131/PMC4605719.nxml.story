: Virtual microscopy requires a new workflow organisation in the pathologist's diagnostic procedure. At a first view, the laboratory workflow seems to remain untouched to a high degree. However, the used laboratory information system (LIS), which is commonly built in a hierarchic order, has to be adjusted at its highest levels, i.e., diagnosis statement, quality evaluation, submission to the clinician (hospital information system), and feedback to the laboratory. Therefore, the laboratory's workflow is involved at all levels too, and the LIS has to be changed or adjusted to the requirements of VM. VM systems are usually equipped with a viewer that mimics the viewing of a conventional microscope, and do not offer access to sensitive nodes of the LIS. Similar, LIS are usually closed and fixed systems because of data security and certification demands. Thus, VM systems have to possess communication access at different LIS levels together with steering commands for the LIS in close association with the diagnostic quality and efficiency (for example demands for additional stains, immunohistochemical or quantitative image methods, etc.), as well as expert consultation, or panel discussion.
