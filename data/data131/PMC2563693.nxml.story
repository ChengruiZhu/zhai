The advent of microarray technology has drawn immense interest to identify gene expression levels that can serve as biomarkers for disease. Marker genes are selected by examining each individual gene to see how well its expression level discriminates different disease types. In complex diseases such as cancer, good marker genes can be hard to find due to cellular heterogeneity within the tissue and genetic heterogeneity across patients. A promising technique for addressing these challenges is to incorporate biological pathway information into the marker identification procedure, permitting disease classification based on the activity of entire pathways rather than simply on the expression levels of individual genes. However, previous pathway-based methods have not significantly outperformed gene-based methods. Here, we propose a new pathway-based classification procedure in which markers are encoded not as individual genes, nor as the set of genes making up a known pathway, but as subsets of “condition-responsive genes (CORGs)” within those pathways. Using expression profiles from seven different microarray studies, we show that the accuracy of this method is significantly better than both the conventional gene- and pathway- based diagnostics. Furthermore, the identified CORGs may facilitate the development of effective diagnostic markers and the discovery of molecular mechanisms underlying disease.
