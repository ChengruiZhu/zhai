RIO framework allows regularities to be detected in an OWL ontology, i.e. repetitive structures in the axioms of an ontology. We describe the use of standard machine learning approaches to make clusters of similar entities and generalise over their axioms to find regularities. This abstraction allows matches to, and deviations from, an ontology’s patterns to be shown. We demonstrate its usage with the inspection of three modules from SNOMED-CT, a large medical terminology, that cover “Present” and “Absent” findings, as well as “Chronic” and “Acute” findings. The module sizes are 5 065, 20 688 and 19 812 asserted axioms. They are analysed in terms of their types and number of regularities and irregularities in the asserted axioms of the ontology. The analysis showed that some modules of the terminology, which were expected to instantiate a pattern described in the SNOMED-CT technical guide, were found to have a high number of regularity deviations. A subset of these were categorised as “design defects” by verifying them with past work on the quality assurance of SNOMED-CT. These were mainly incomplete descriptions. In the worst case, the expected patterns described in the technical guide were followed by only 5% of the axioms in the module.
