Colloidal dispersion of single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) is often the first processing step to many of their unique applications. However, dispersed SWCNTs often exist in kinetically trapped states where aggregation can be of concern. Recent work revealed prominent DNA–SWCNT aggregation following intravascular injection. In this study, we performed detailed analysis of DNA–SWCNT aggregate formation, structure, and composition in the context of endothelial cell condition media. Interestingly, we found that aggregates formed within condition media from cells that have undergone a stress response differ in size and organization from that of the control. We also found that temperature increases also promote DNA–SWCNT associations. A mathematical model was developed to describe the kinetics of SWCNT extraction from solution. Through orthogonal optical analysis and imaging modalities, we verified that proteins form the bulk of the aggregate structure and dictate aggregate assembly at multiple levels of organization. Finally, physiochemical analysis indicated preferential extraction of low-abundance hydrophobic and charged proteins. The formed aggregates also remain relatively stable in solution, making them potential macroscopic indicators of solution content.
