The primary strategy to fight gambiense human African trypanosomiasis (HAT) is to perform extensive population screening operations among endemic villages. Since the progression of the epidemic is largely influenced by the planning of these operations, it is crucial to develop adequate models on this relation and to employ these for the development of effective planning policies. We introduce and test five models that describe the expected development of the HAT prevalence in a given village based on historical information. Next, we demonstrate the applicability of one of these models to evaluate planning policies, presenting mathematical expressions for the relationship between participation in screening rounds, sensitivity of the diagnostic test, endemicity level in the village considered, and the screening frequency required to reach eradication (zero prevalence) or elimination (one case per 10000) within a given time-frame. Applying these expressions to the Kwamouth health zone (DRC) yields estimates of the maximum screening interval that leads to eradication, the expected time to elimination, and the case detection fraction needed to reach elimination within five years. This paper serves as a basis for further modeling and optimization studies.
