Metals, and particularly their positively charged ions (cations), are an integral part of our environment, and all living organisms are exposed to metals in their natural habitat. Even though significant efforts have already been made by experimental and theoretical analysis of the individual components of transport systems and individual transport-mechanisms, such efforts did not result in an integration of the highly connected and complex system. The development of kinetic networks might well contribute to the understanding and visualization of cation homeostasis. However, such kinetic systemic analysis would require more detailed biochemical information than is currently available. We circumvented this problem by using an entirely phenomenological approach of the theory of non-equilibrium thermodynamics. The methodology does not require the detailed understanding of structure, function or kinetic parameters of individual constituents of the system but produces some unique parameters related to thermodynamic couplings between different ion fluxes and ATP consumption. These estimated phenomenological constants combine the kinetic parameters and transport coefficients and control the coupling of fluxes. The model predictions are in good agreement with the biological understanding of the roles of the transporter proteins. Our modeling approach might contribute to the development of new diagnostic and therapeutic purposes with cation-homeostasis as key-target.
