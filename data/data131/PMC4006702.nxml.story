We developed the new information theory-based analysis framework presented here, NbIT analysis, for the study of allosteric mechanisms in biomolecular systems from Molecular Dynamics trajectories. The illustrative application of NbIT to the analysis of the occluded state in the bacterial transporter LeuT, produced a quantitative representation of the allosteric behavior, and identified intramolecular channels that enable the long-distance information transmission. Our findings, identifying the roles of specific residues in the communication of the allosteric information, were validated by the recognition of residues that have been previously shown to play functional roles in this very well studied system. In addition, we show that application of NbIT analysis leads to the discrimination of functional roles by differentiating between residues that are essential to the dynamics within functional sites (e.g., the substrate binding sites), and residues whose role is to communicate between such functional sites. These results demonstrate that the information theoretical analysis presented here is a powerful tool for quantifying complex allosteric behavior in biomolecular systems and for identifying the crucial components underlying those behaviors.
