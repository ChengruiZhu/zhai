Vasculopathy is a major complication of diabetes; however, molecular mechanisms mediating the development of vasculopathy and potential strategies for prevention have not been identified. We have previously reported that C-peptide prevents diabetic vasculopathy by inhibiting reactive oxygen species (ROS)-mediated endothelial apoptosis. To gain further insight into ROS-dependent mechanism of diabetic vasculopathy and its prevention, we studied high glucose–induced cytosolic and mitochondrial ROS production and its effect on altered mitochondrial dynamics and apoptosis. For the therapeutic strategy, we investigated the vasoprotective mechanism of C-peptide against hyperglycemia-induced endothelial damage through the AMP-activated protein kinase α (AMPKα) pathway using human umbilical vein endothelial cells and aorta of diabetic mice. High glucose (33 mmol/L) increased intracellular ROS through a mechanism involving interregulation between cytosolic and mitochondrial ROS generation. C-peptide (1 nmol/L) activation of AMPKα inhibited high glucose–induced ROS generation, mitochondrial fission, mitochondrial membrane potential collapse, and endothelial cell apoptosis. Additionally, the AMPK activator 5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide 1-β-
