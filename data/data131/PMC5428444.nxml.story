Growing evidence indicates that SLC3A2 (solute carrier family 3 member 2) is upregulated and correlates with tumor growth in multiple types of cancers, while the role of SLC3A2 in human osteosarcoma (OS) is rarely discussed. Thus, the aim of the present study was to demonstrate the expression of SLC3A2 in human osteosarcoma and reveal its biological function and the underlying mechanisms. RT-PCR, western blot analysis and immunohistochemistry (IHC) were used to assess the expression of SLC3A2 in OS samples and cell lines. Cell cycle, Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK-8) and colony formation assays were used to test the cell survival capacity. To investigate the potential mechanism by which SLC3A2 regulates OS growth, we used a slide-based antibody array. We demonstrated that SLC3A2 was upregulated in OS cell lines as well as OS tissues. High expression of SLC3A2 was correlated with clinical stage and tumor size in OS. Reduced expression of SLC3A2 inhibited OS cell proliferation through G2/M phase arrest. Most importantly, we found that SLC3A2 may regulate OS growth through the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway. In conclusion, SLC3A2 is upregulated in OS and plays a crucial role in tumor growth. Targeting SLC3A2 may provide a new therapeutic strategy for OS.
