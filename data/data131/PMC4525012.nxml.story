 Fifteen patients were diagnosed with proven (12, 80%) or probable (3, 20%) fusariosis. Median age was 60 years (range, 26–78), and 10 patients were male. Underlying conditions included hematological malignancies (13, 87%), juvenile idiopathic arthritis (1, 7%), and third-degree burns (1, 7%). Five patients underwent hematopoietic stem-cell transplantation before diagnosis. Six patients (40%) received systemic glucocorticoids, and 11 patients (73%) had prolonged neutropenia at the time of diagnosis. Clinical presentations included the following: skin/soft tissue infection (8, 53%), febrile neutropenia (4, 27%), respiratory tract infection (2, 13%), and septic arthritis (1, 7%). Twelve patients were treated with voriconazole: 6 (40%) with voriconazole alone, 4 (27%) with voriconazole and terbinafine, and 2 (13%) with voriconazole, terbinafine, and amphotericin. One patient (7%) was treated with terbinafine alone, and another with micafungin alone. Four patients underwent surgical debridement (4, 27%). Susceptibility testing was performed on 9 isolates; 8 demonstrated voriconazole minimum inhibitory concentrations ≥4 µg/mL. The cumulative probability of survival was 66.7% and 53.3% at 6 and 12 weeks after diagnosis.
