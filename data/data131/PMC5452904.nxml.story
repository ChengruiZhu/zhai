The present study aimed to investigate the expression and prognostic significance of insulin-like growth factor binding protein 6 (IGFBP-6) in gastric adenocarcinoma. The expression of IGFBP-6 was examined in 263 specimens from gastric adenocarcinoma patients using reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR), western blotting and immunohistochemical (IHC) staining. The association between IGFBP-6 expression, clinicopathological factors and clinical outcomes was investigated. Akaike information criterion (AIC) and Harrell's concordance index (c-index) were used to evaluate the accuracy of the predictive prognosis. RT-qPCR and western blotting results showed that IGFBP-6 mRNA expression was lower in the tumors compared with that in adjacent non-tumor tissues. IGFBP-6 showed significantly decreased expression in 170 out of 263 patients based on IHC data and this was associated with a larger tumor size (P<0.001) and poorly-differentiated adenocarcinoma (P=0.001), as well as with palliative gastrectomy (P=0.015). Additionally, decreased expression of IGFBP-6 was associated with stage T3/4a/4b disease and lymph node-positive metastasis (P<0.001). The association between decreased expression and a poor prognosis was revealed by Kaplan-Meier curves. Cox regression model identified IGFBP-6 as an independent prognostic factor. The prognostic value of the model with IGFBP-6 expression (AIC, 924.881; c-index, 0.878) was superior to that without IGFBP-6 expression (AIC, 947.164; c-index, 0.825). In conclusion, IGFBP-6 involves the development and progression of gastric adenocarcinoma, and its decreased expression predicts poor clinical outcomes.
