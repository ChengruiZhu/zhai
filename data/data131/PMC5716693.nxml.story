The calpain 2 (CAPN2) is upregulated in various malignant carcinomas. Previous studies have reported that CAPN2 functioned as an oncogenic factor in human cancers. However, its clinical role and potential effects on cell metastasis and proliferation in renal cell carcinoma (RCC) remain unknown. In this study, we evaluated the mRNA and protein levels of CAPN2 in human RCC specimens, matched normal specimens, and RCC cell lines using quantitative Real-time PCR (RT-PCR) and western blot. Immunohistochemistry of 74 RCC tissues in a tissue microarrays (TMAs) and normal kidney tissues were performed. Kaplan-Meier survival curve analyses were conducted to measure the correlation between CAPN2 and tumor prognosis. Cell migration, invasion and proliferation were detected by transwell assays and Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK-8) assays. CAPN2 exhibited a significant overexpression in human RCC tissues and cell lines compared with adjacent non-tumor tissues and normal human proximal tubule epithelial cell line HK-2. Strong staining of CAPN2 was associated with higher clinical stage and histological grade. In addition, sh-CAPN2 could significantly inhibit migration, invasion and proliferation of 769-P and CAKI-1 cells. Conversely, increased cell biological behaviors were observed in CAPN2-OV CAKI-2 cells. Moreover, the subsequent mechanism investigation suggested that CAPN2 promoted tumor progression by activating AKT/mTOR signaling, enhancing epithelial mesenchymal transition (EMT) and MMP9 levels. The present study indicates that CAPN2 may act as a prominent indicator for RCC progression and a novel therapeutic target for RCC patients.
