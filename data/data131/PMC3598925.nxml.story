We defined the molecular immunological correlates of LTBI establishment in a rabbit model of pulmonary infection with Mtb CDC1551. After aerosol infection, exponential bacterial growth was noted in the lungs for 4 weeks, followed by a significant decline by 12 weeks, resulting in the absence of cultivable bacilli by 24 weeks. We used rabbit whole genome microarrays to profile the lung transcriptome during the course of infection. At 2 weeks post-infection, gene networks involved in natural killer (NK) and dendritic cell (DC) activation and macrophage antimicrobial activities were highly upregulated. This was followed by upregulation of gene networks involved in macrophage and T cell activation and autophagy, peaking at 4 to 8 weeks. Concomitantly, host Th1, but not Th2 or inflammatory, immune response genes were significantly upregulated. Thus, the expression kinetics of genes involved in cross-talk between innate and adaptive immunity over the first 8 weeks post-infection were consistent with early efficient control of infection in the lungs. Interestingly, expression of many genes of the host innate and adaptive immune response pathways was downregulated at 12 weeks, suggesting that immune activation did not persist once bacilli began to clear from the infected lungs.
