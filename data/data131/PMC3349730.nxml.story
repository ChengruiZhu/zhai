Genome duplication requires the orderly initiation of DNA synthesis at sites called origins of replication. It has long been known that different origins become active at different times in S-phase (the period during which cells duplicate their chromosomes). Although such temporal regulation of replication is broadly conserved among eukaryotes, how this regional control of replication time occurs largely remains a mystery. The early replication of baker's yeast centromeres (genetic elements essential for proper segregation of chromosomes during cell division) is one frequently cited example of temporal regulation, yet the biological significance of early centromere replication also remains speculative. Increasing evidence suggests that early centromere replication is a conserved feature of the DNA replication program across many species. Here, we show that centromeres in this yeast can advance the time at which origins in their genomic neighborhood initiate DNA replication. The distance over which centromeres can influence origin activation time extends up to 19 kilobases. We further show that centromere-mediated early origin activation depends on the centromere's ability to recruit at least a subset of the proteins needed for chromosome segregation. This study thus provides the first direct functional link between kinetochore establishment and the mechanisms of DNA replication initiation.
