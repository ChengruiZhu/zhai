We have examined the actions of several amino group reagents on delayed rectifier potassium channels in squid giant axons. Three general classes of reagents were used: (1) those that preserved the positive charge of amino groups; (2) those that neutralize the charge; and (3) those that replace the positive with a negative charge. All three types of reagents produced qualitatively similar effects on K channel properties. Trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid (TNBS) neutralizes the peptide terminal amino groups and the epsilon-amino group of lysine groups. TNBS (a) slowed the kinetics of macroscopic ionic currents; (b) increased the size of ionic currents at large positive voltages; (c) shifted the voltage-dependent probability of channel opening to more positive potentials but had no effect on the voltage sensitivity; and (d) altered several properties of K channel gating currents. The actions of TNBS on gating currents suggest the presence of multiple gating current components. These effects are not all coupled, suggesting that several amino groups on the external surface of K channels are important for channel gating. A simple kinetic model that considers the channel to be composed of independent heterologous subunits is consistent with most of the modifications produced by amino group reagents.
