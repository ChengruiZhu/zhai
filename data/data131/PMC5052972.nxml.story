Visceral hypersensitivity (VH) is a common condition in many gastrointestinal disorders such as inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs) in human and animals. Most studies often induce Crohn’s disease/colitis to investigate VH in small experimental animals. Although farm animals commonly suffer from IBDs, their VH has not been investigated so far. Because goats can suffer from Johne’s disease, a naturally occurring Crohn’s-like disease, they may be suitable to be used for studying the mechanism underlying VH in common intestinal disorders of large animals. In the present study, 60 healthy goats of either sex were equally divided into a 2, 4, 6-trinitrobenzenesulfonic acid (TNBS) group and saline group. A volume of 1.2 ml of TNBS-ethanol solution (30 mg TNBS in 40 % ethanol) or an equal volume of isotonic saline was injected into the wall of the terminal ileum through laparotomy. The severity of the developing ileitis was determined according to macro- and microscopic pathologic scores and the levels of myeloperoxidase, interleukin-1β, interleukin-6 and tumor necrosis factor-α, and VH was evaluated with visceromotor responses (VMR) to colorectal distension on days 3, 7, 14, 21 and 28. VMRs were assessed with a continuous ramp distention mode with 6 s for each pressure (20, 40, 60, 80 and 100 mmHg).
