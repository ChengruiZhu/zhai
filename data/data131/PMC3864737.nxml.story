Colesevelam’s glucose-lowering mechanism of action is not completely understood. Clinical trials of colesevelam suggest that its mechanism, and often adverse effects, differ from those of other oral antidiabetes drugs. Colesevelam does not affect insulin sensitivity (unlike thiazolidinediones), insulin secretion (unlike sulfonylureas and meglitinides), or early insulin response or glucagon (unlike dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors). Colesevelam may have some effect on glucose absorption, but likely via a different mechanism than α-glucosidase inhibitors. Colesevelam and metformin have similarities regarding hepatic glucose production, but divergent effects on gluconeogenesis versus glycogenolysis, suggesting differing mechanisms of drug action for improving glycemic control. Colesevelam is thought to be a portal glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) secretagogue with primarily hepatic effects. Bile acid binding by colesevelam leads to TGR5 activation, increased secretion of GLP-1 or other incretins, and inhibition of hepatic glycogenolysis. Colesevelam’s mechanism of action appears to be atypical of other antidiabetes medications, making it a potentially suitable component of many combination regimens in the treatment of type 2 diabetes.
