GENERAL is a multicenter, prospective, non-interventional observational study of patients receiving rivaroxaban for NVAF in daily clinical practice prescribed specifically by general practitioners. The target number of participating medical institutions is 500â€“700 clinics with fewer than 20 beds and the target number of participants is 5000. The baseline clinical data, including antidementia medication and frailty, and follow-up data including concomitant treatment and outcomes until September 2018 (maximum three years) will be collected. The primary efficacy endpoints will be stroke and/or systemic embolism and the secondary endpoints will be major bleeding meeting the ISTH guidelines, non-major and clinically relevant bleeding, onset of symptomatic stroke (ischemic/hemorrhagic), systemic embolism, deep vein thrombosis/pulmonary thromboembolism, myocardial infarction and/or cardiovascular death, and systemic embolism. Based on the provided information, the event assessment committee will investigate the endpoint-related events. The annual incidence and predictive factors for primary/secondary endpoint will be investigated based on underlying disease, age, renal function, and CHADS
