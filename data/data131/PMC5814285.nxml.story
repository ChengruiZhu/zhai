LncRNA actin filament-associated protein 1 antisense RNA 1 (AFAP1-AS1) is often dysregulated in cancer. We performed this meta-analysis to clarify the usefulness of AFAP1-AS1 as a prognostic marker in malignant tumors. The PubMed, Medline, OVID, Cochrane Library, and Web of Science databases were searched from inception to Augest 7, 2017. Sixteen studies with a total of 1,386 patients were included in the study. The pooled hazard ratio (HR) suggested high AFAP1-AS1 expression correlated with poor overall survival (OS) (HR = 1.98, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.71–2.28), disease-free survival (DFS) (HR = 1.54, 95% CI: 1.22–1.95), and progression-free survival (PFS) (HR = 2.17, 95% CI:1.64–2.88) in cancer patients, without obvious heterogeneity. High AFAP1-AS1 expression also correlated with larger tumor size (odds ratio (OR) = 2.04, 95% CI: 1.54–2.72), advanced tumor stage (OR=2.35, 95% CI: 1.70–3.26), poor histological grade (OR =1.39, 95% CI: 1.02–1.90), lymph node metastasis (OR = 2.71, 95% CI: 1.98–3.72) and distant metastasis (OR = 2.96, 95% CI: 2.03–4.32). Thus high AFAP1-AS1 expression is predictive of poor OS, DFS, PFS, lymph node metastasis, distant metastasis, histological grade, larger tumor size and tumor stage, which suggests high AFAP1-AS1 expression may serve as a novel biomarker of poor prognosis in cancer.
