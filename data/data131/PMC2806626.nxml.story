The inflammatory mediator thrombin proteolytically activates protease-activated receptor (PAR1) eliciting a transient, but reversible increase in vascular permeability. PAR1-induced dissociation of Gα subunit from heterotrimeric Gq and G12/G13 proteins is known to signal the increase in endothelial permeability. However, the role of released Gβγ is unknown. We now show that impairment of Gβγ function does not affect the permeability increase induced by PAR1, but prevents reannealing of adherens junctions (AJ), thereby persistently elevating endothelial permeability. We observed that in the naive endothelium Gβ1, the predominant Gβ isoform is sequestered by receptor for activated C kinase 1 (RACK1). Thrombin induced dissociation of Gβ1 from RACK1, resulting in Gβ1 interaction with Fyn and focal adhesion kinase (FAK) required for FAK activation. RACK1 depletion triggered Gβ1 activation of FAK and endothelial barrier recovery, whereas Fyn knockdown interrupted with Gβ1-induced barrier recovery indicating RACK1 negatively regulates Gβ1-Fyn signaling. Activated FAK associated with AJ and stimulated AJ reassembly in a Fyn-dependent manner. Fyn deletion prevented FAK activation and augmented lung vascular permeability increase induced by PAR1 agonist. Rescuing FAK activation in
