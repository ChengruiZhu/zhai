Characterizing the functional roles of gene regulatory sequences and the impact of genetic polymorphism on protein-DNA binding are rapidly growing areas of genomics. The p53 tumor suppressor regulates its target genes through sequence-specific binding to DNA response elements, and we have developed a multiplex format microsphere assay (MAPD) to probe how sequence variation alters p53 binding. Testing pools of multiplexed oligonucleotides that contain numerous p53 binding targets or different sequence variants, we demonstrate that subtle changes in target sequence can impact p53 binding, and these effects are not captured by commonly used computational binding models. A group of single nucleotide polymorphisms was examined and binding profiles closely matched gene expression measured in a parallel system. We also observed distinct binding patterns that were characteristic of transiently expressed wild type and mutant p53s, suggesting that this method may be useful for probing the impact of protein structural variation on DNA binding. MAPD utilizes biologically meaningful cell extracts in a multiplexed, quantitative format that provides a powerful experimental tool for elucidating the functional impact of sequence polymorphism and protein variation on protein/DNA binding in transcriptional networks.
