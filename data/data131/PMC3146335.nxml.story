Lip cancer is the most frequent malignant neoplasm of the oral cavity. The study reported herewith refers to the clinico-pathological features and surgical treatment of lip cancer. The most frequent tumour related to the lips is squamous cell carcinoma, with the lower lip more commonly involved than the upper lip. Typically, squamous cell carcinoma originates in the red lip, whereas basal cell carcinoma involves the white lip. The management of lip cancer involves the control not only of the primary tumours with oncologically appropriate margins and subsequent reconstruction to allow oral competence during the oral phase of swallowing, but also the possible metastatic spread to the neck. Reconstruction is a surgical challenge especially for advanced and extended lesions. A successful reconstruction depends on careful pre-operative planning, knowledge of the anatomy and use of the various surgical techniques. Lymph node neck metastases significantly reduce long-term survival. Although the management of the neck is controversial in lip cancer, particularly with respect to the neck, elective or curative supra-omohyoid neck dissection is the best choice for occult or evident loco-regional metastases. Early stage tumours have good prognostic, aesthetic and functional results after surgery compared to the treatment of advanced lesions, which alter the appearance and functionality of the lip. The Authors report their experience in the treatment of lip tumours at the primary site, considering reconstructive problems, together with management of neck metastases.
