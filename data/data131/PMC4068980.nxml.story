Neuronal cell decline in neurodegenerative disease can be caused by inherited mutations and involves neuronal dysfunction followed by neuronal death. The ability of neurons to cope with the chronic stress induced by mutant protein expression may determine the course of their decline and eventual demise. Although the pathophysiological importance of these stress responses has been previously shown, very little is known about the signaling networks that regulate neuronal homeostasis during the early presymptomatic—but pathogenic—phases of a neurodegenerative disorder such as Huntington's disease (HD). In particular, it remains unclear whether neuronal differentiation factors regulate stress response pathways during neurodegenerative disease and how this might impact the overall capacity of neurons to cope with stress and maintain their function. Here, we show that the Wnt receptor Ryk, a protein known to be important for neurogenesis, is increased in different animal models of HD, before or during the early phases of the disease process. Interestingly, increased levels of Ryk repress activity of the FOXO proteins—a family of transcription factors that play a role in cell survival/longevity and in neuronal homeostasis and protection. Ryk represses FOXO protective activity, possibly directly, through its intracellular domain, a product of γ-secretase–mediated cleavage previously implicated in the birth of new cortical neurons. This highlights the regulation of HD neuron survival by a Ryk-dependent pathway that is distinct from canonical Wnt/Ryk signaling. From our findings, we postulate that neurons are unable to develop an efficient FOXO-mediated survival response during the very early, pathogenic phases of HD.
