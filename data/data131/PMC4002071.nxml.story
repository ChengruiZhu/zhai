Akt kinase controls cell survival, proliferation, and invasive growth and is a critical factor for cancer development. Here we describe a cross-talk between phosphatases that may preserve levels of activated/phosphorylated Akt and confer aggressive growth of cancer cells. In prostatic cancer cells, but not in non-transformed cells or in prostate stem cells, we found that the phosphatase and tensin homolog deleted on chromosome 10 (PTEN) overexpression down-regulated PH domain and leucine-rich repeat phosphatase (PHLPP) and that PHLPP overexpression down-regulated PTEN. We also show that silencing PTEN by siRNA increased the levels of PHLPPs. This cross-talk facilitated invasive migration and was mediated by epigenetic alterations, including activation of miR-190, miR-214, polycomb group of proteins, as well as DNA methylation. A role for the purinergic receptor P2X4, previously associated with wound healing, was indicated. We also show that TGF-β1 induced cross-talk concomitant with epithelial-mesenchymal transition in stem cells. The cross-talk emerged as an integrated part of epithelial-mesenchymal transition. We conclude that cross-talk between PTEN and PHLPPs is silenced in normal prostate cells but activated in TGF-β1 transformed prostate stem and cancer cells and facilitates invasive growth.
