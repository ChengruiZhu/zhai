A two-dimensional projection of the visual world, termed a retinotopic map, is spread across the striate and extra-striate areas of the human brain. The organization of retinotopic maps has been described with algebraic functions that map position in the visual field to points on the cortical surface. These functions represent the cortical surface as a flat sheet. In fact, the surface of the brain is intrinsically curved. Flattening the cortical surface thus introduces geometric distortions of the cortical sheet that limit the fitting of algebraic functions to actual brain imaging data. We present a technique to fix the problem of geometric distortions. We collected retinotopic mapping data using functional MRI from a group of people. We treated the cortical surface as a mass-spring-damper system and corrected the topology of the cortical surface to register the functional imaging data to an algebraic model of retinotopic organization. From this registration we construct a template that is able to predict the retinotopic organization of cortical visual areas V1, V2, and V3 using only the brain anatomy of a subject. The accuracy of this prediction is comparable to that of functional measurement itself.
