61 healthy individuals, without any orthopedic or neurological symptoms that affect the knee joint proprioception sense, were included in this study. Individuals' socio-demographic data were recorded. Hamstring muscle tightness was measured with active knee extension (ACE) method by using goniometer. Individuals with hamstring muscle tightness (ACE over of 20 °) was Group 1 and individuals without tightness (ACE 20 ° and under) was Group 2. Proprioceptive component of joint position sense and kinaesthesia was evaluated for the sense of proprioception. Prosport 1000 PMS (Tümer Machine Ankara, Turkey) instrument was used and visual, auditory, tactile, sensory input have been eliminated. Passive placement method and 20 and 40 degrees of knee flexion target angles was used for measurement. For joint position sense target angle predict degree, for kinesthesia perceive movement sense degree was recorded. Instrument moved 10 degrees/sec for joint position sense and 0.4 degrees/sec for kinesthesia. All measurements were repeated three times for dominant and non-dominant side. SPSS version 21 was used for statistical analysis and p values of 0.05 and less were considered evidence of statistically significant findings. Mann-Whitney U rank test was used to compare findings of two groups.
