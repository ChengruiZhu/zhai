The loading of needles for loose seed implantation of the prostate gland results requires a significant amount of effort and some radiation exposure to members of the medical staff. This study was performed to quantify the time spent and exposure levels associated with implant preparation, as well as to investigate any improvement in the time or exposure burden due to the introduction of a new loading device. The movements and radiation exposures for two single, highly experienced dosimetrists were monitored for ten conventionally loaded iodine implant cases. These same cases were reloaded with dummy sources using the sleeved system to determine time savings, if any. Two of these ten cases were then loaded with live sources using the sleeved system to determine relative exposure to the loading staff between the two methods. The results were then analyzed to generate per‐seed and per‐needle loading time and exposure burdens. Formulas are presented that may be used to determine the average time to load implants and the resultant staff exposure, both with the conventional technique and with the sleeved method. On the average, it takes an experienced loader 48 min to prepare an implant for the operating room, receiving a hand dose of about 10 mrem and a whole body dose of about 1 mrem. The sleeved system reduced these values by at least half. The time and exposure burden associated with the preparation of iodine loose seed implants has been characterized. The use of the sleeved needles resulted in significant time and exposure reductions for the medical staff.
