Total of ten female adolescent Anatolian Black Goats were included in the study. A midsubstance central defect was created successfully with a four mm. arthroscopic punch in the ACLs of right knees of all the subjects through a medial mini-arthrotomy and goats were assigned to groups whether the fat pad was preserved (group I, n=5) or excised completely (group II, n=5). The left knees served as control. The histopathological evaluations of the defect area were performed utilizing Hematoxylene-Eosine, Masson Trichrome, Van Gieson, and elastic Van Gieson staining as well as measurement of type I collagen immunohistochemically in one sample from each group at 10th week postoperatively. The remaining knees were evaluated biomechanically at the 12th week, measuring anterior tibial translation (ATT) of the knee joints at 90 degrees of flexion and tensile properties (Maximum Tensile Load (MTL), Maximum Elongation (ME), Stiffness (S), failure mode (FM)) of the femur-ACL-tibia complex. Statistical analysis was performed utilizing SPSS v18 package program. Mann – Whitney U and Wilcoxon’s signed rank test were used for inter and intragroup analysis, respectively. Statistical significance was set at 0.05.
