Accurately evaluating the size of a neurovascular lesion is essential for properly devising treatment strategies. The magnification factor must be considered in order to measure the dimension of a lesion from an angiogram. Although a method to calculate the magnification of the lesion by linear interpolation of the measurable magnification factors of two markers has been in use, this paper shows that it can be inaccurate. By deriving the exact formula for calculating the magnification factor at the level of the lesion, the error generated by the linear interpolation of magnification factor has been evaluated. This error was found to depend on source‐to‐skin distance (SSD), the location of the lesion in the head, and the head size. The closer the head is to the focal spot and the nearer the lesion is to the center of the head, the larger is the error. Since clinicians tend to use high geometric magnification (i.e., small SSD) in interventional procedures, there exists a possible consequential error of more than 3% in lesion sizing if the linear‐interpolation calculation method is used. It is thus recommended that the exact formula derived here be used to calculate the magnification factor to improve accuracy.
