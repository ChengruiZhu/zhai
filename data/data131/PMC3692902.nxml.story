We examined syndromic surveillance data from 45 hospitals in NYC for 2011 and classified visits into a primary care syndrome based on the chief complaint field. Data from 4 hospitals were omitted due to data quality issues, as were records from non-NYC residents. Primary care (PC) syndrome visits included visits recorded as referrals, screenings, suture removal/dressing changes, or medication refills; records with a blank or non-informative (e.g. “X”) chief complaint field were omitted from analysis. Using unique patient IDs, we identified patients who visited the same ED multiple times in the previous 12 months. A hierarchical generalized linear mixed effects model with hospital-level random effects was used to explore patient characteristics associated with PC syndrome visits. The model included a random intercept for hospital and the following covariates: duplicate visit, patient gender and age group (ages 0–4, 5–17, 18–64, and 65+), and time of visit (midnight to 8 AM, 8 AM to midnight). Covariates for month and day of week were included to control for temporal trends in ED visits. Model parameters were estimated by maximum likelihood. Estimation was performed in SAS version 9.2 [
