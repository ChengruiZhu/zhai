Many serious diseases have a strong metabolic component. The abnormal metabolic states of diseased cells could therefore be targets for treatment. However, metabolism is a highly complex and interconnected system in which thousands of metabolic reactions occur simultaneously in any given cell type. In order to understand how metabolism of a diseased cell differs from its healthy counterpart we must therefore study the system as a whole. We have developed an algorithm that integrates several types of data in order to generate active metabolic networks; catalogues of the metabolic reactions that are likely to be active in a given cell type. We applied this algorithm to data for 69 healthy cell types and 16 cancer cell types. These metabolic networks can form the basis for simulation of metabolic interactions between organs or as scaffolds for interpretation of high-throughput data. We used these networks to perform an analysis between cancer and healthy cell types in order to identify cancer specific metabolic features that constitute potential drug targets. Several of the resulting targets were already known and used clinically, but we also found high-ranking reactions and metabolites which have not yet been investigated as drug targets.
