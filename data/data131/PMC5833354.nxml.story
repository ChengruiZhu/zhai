miR-195 has recently been reported to function as a tumor suppressor in various cancers, including non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). However, the mechanisms by which miR-195 represses the tumorigenesis of NSCLC cells are not fully understood. We performed a high-throughput screen using an miRNA mimic library and confirmed the identification of miR-195 as a tumor suppressor in NSCLC. We demonstrated that overexpression or induced expression of miR-195 in lung tumors slows tumor growth and that repression of miR-195 accelerates tumor growth. In addition, we found that knockout of miR-195 promotes cancer cell growth. We demonstrated that miR-195 targets cyclin D3 to cause cell cycle arrest at the G1 phase and that miR-195 targets survivin to induce apoptosis and senescence in NSCLC cells. Overexpression of cyclin D3 or survivin reverses the effects of miR-195 in NSCLC cells. Through the analysis of data from The Cancer Genome Atlas, we confirmed that the expression of miR-195 is lower in tumors than in adjacent normal tissues and that low expression of miR-195 is associated with poor survival in both lung adenocarcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma patients. Specifically, we found that
