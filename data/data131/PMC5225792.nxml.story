The aim of the present study was to evaluate the oncological efficacy of salvage total laryngectomy in patients who had previously undergone supracricoid partial laryngectomy or transoral laser microsurgery for treatment of laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma. We retrospectively reviewed the medical, surgical and pathological records of 35 patients who underwent salvage total laryngectomy after recurrence of laryngeal cancer (following supracricoid partial laryngectomy or transoral laser microsurgery). Kaplan-Meier survival curves as well as univariate and multivariate analyses of prognostic factors were performed. No statistically significant differences were seen comparing the supracricoid partial laryngectomy group with the transoral laser microsurgery group for overall survival and disease-specific survival at 3 years (OS = 38% vs. 52%, p = 0.16; DSS = 40% vs. 61%, p = 0.057) or locoregional control at 2 years (LRC = 40% vs. 54%, p = 0.056). A trend indicating worse survival and locoregional control for supracricoid partial laryngectomy patients emerged. Preservation of the osteocartilaginous frame in transoral laser microsurgery could hypothetically result in better salvageability of anterior recurrences with extralaryngeal spread.
