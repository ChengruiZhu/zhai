Sensory systems automatically detect salient events in a monotonous ambient background. In humans, this change detection process is indexed by the mismatch negativity (MMN), a mid-late component of the auditory-evoked potentials that has become a central tool in cognitive and clinical neuroscience over the last 40 years. However, the neuronal correlate of MMN remains controversial. Stimulus-specific adaptation (SSA) is a special type of adaptation recorded at the neuronal level in the auditory pathway. Attenuating the response only to repetitive, background stimuli is a very efficient mechanism to enhance the saliency of any upcoming deviant or novel stimulus. Thus, SSA was originally proposed as a neural correlate of the MMN, but previous studies in the auditory cortex reported SSA only at very early latencies (circa 20â€“30 ms) and only within the primary auditory cortex (A1), whereas MMN analogs in the rat occur later, between 50 and 100 ms after change onset, and are generated mainly within nonprimary fields. Here, we report very strong SSA in nonprimary fields within the latency range of the MMN in the rat, providing empirical evidence of the missing link between single neuron response studies in animal models and the human MMN.
