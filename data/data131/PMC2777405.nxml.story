The right temporal cortex has previously been shown to play a greater role in the discrimination of faces in both sheep and humans. In the frequency domain, analysis of the relative causal contributions of low (theta 4–8Hz) and high (gamma 30–70Hz) frequency oscillations reveals that prior to learning, theta activity is more predominant in right than in left hemisphere processing, and that learning reduces this so that high frequency oscillations gain more control. We have been able to demonstrate that the frequency of connections increases in the right hemisphere and decreases between the left and right hemispheres after learning. The results are obtained based upon a way to combine aspects of both the Granger and Dynamic Causal Models, which can be used to establish significant causal relations in both time and frequency domains and applied to local field potential recordings from multiple (64 channel) electrodes implanted in the inferotemporal cortex of both sides of the brain in sheep in order to establish changes in causal connections within and between the two hemispheres as a result of learning to discriminate visually between pairs of faces. It is anticipated that this new approach to the measurement of causality will not only help reveal how the two brain hemispheres interact, but will also be applicable to many different types of biological data where variations in both frequency and temporal domains can be measured.
