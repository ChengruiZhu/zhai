It is well known that radioactive rays may cause damage to the human body. Progress in modern medicine has led to an increased risk of therapeutic and diagnostic radiation exposure of patients. Although clear evidence of a radiation dose-dependent risk of chronic myeloid leukaemia, particularly for patients exposed to radiation at a young age, has been established, it is not known whether radiation exposure during diagnostic imaging also increases the risk of cancer. The present study reports the case of a patient who underwent several diagnostic imaging tests (including repeated chest radiography and computed tomography) for recurrent pneumothorax. At around one year subsequent to these tests, the patient was diagnosed with chronic myeloid leukaemia. The patient exhibited an increase in white blood cell count over time, and a bone marrow smear test showed a myeloid/erythroid ratio of 13.9:1. In addition, the qualitative breakpoint cluster region (BCR)/Abelson (ABL) gene test revealed positive results for BCR/ABL fusion (p210). Based on the data reported in the current case, research aimed at elucidating the potential risks associated with diagnostic radiation is urgently required. It is crucial that medical professionals consider the potential harmful side effects of diagnostic radiation when ordering radiation-based diagnostic imaging examinations.
