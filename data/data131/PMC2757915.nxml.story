During S phase of the cell cycle, not only must DNA sequences be faithfully duplicated, chromatin structures must also be inherited into daughter cells to maintain gene expression states and cell identity. While significant progress has been made in understanding the regulation of DNA replication, how chromatin structures are maintained from one cell division cycle to the next (so-called epigenetic inheritance) is only partially understood. It is believed that the DNA replication-coupled nucleosome assembly process plays an important role in such inheritance as well as maintenance of genome stability. In this process, histone chaperones such as chromatin assembly factor 1 (CAF-1) deposit newly synthesized histones H3â€“H4, which are acetylated at specific lysine residues, onto replicating DNA in a PCNA dependent reaction. PCNA is a clamp for DNA polymerases and other proteins that are involved in DNA replication and DNA repair. Genetic interactions between lysine acetyltransferase Elp3 and factors involved in DNA replication-coupled nucleosome assembly are described. Elp3 is required for transcriptional silencing and for maintenance of genome stability and binds directly to PCNA. A role for the Elongator complex in response to DNA damage and in maintenance of gene silencing is discussed.
