This protocol paper presents the iSOLVE implementation processes and change strategies and outlines the study design of a blended type 2 hybrid design. The study consists of a two-arm cluster randomized controlled trial in 28 general practices and recruiting 560 patients in Sydney, Australia, to evaluate effectiveness of the iSOLVE intervention in changing general practitioner fall management practices and reducing patient falls and the cost effectiveness from a healthcare funder perspective. Secondary outcomes include change in medications known to increase fall risk. We will simultaneously conduct a multi-methodology evaluation to investigate the workability and utility of the implementation intervention. The implementation evaluation includes in-depth interviews and surveys with general practitioners and allied health professionals to explore acceptability and uptake of the intervention, the coherence of the proposed changes for those in the work setting, and how to facilitate the collective action needed to implement changes in practice; social network mapping will explore professional relationships and influences on referral patterns; and, a survey of GPs in the geographical intervention zone will test diffusion of evidence-based fall prevention practices. The project works in partnership with a primary care health network, state fall prevention leaders, and a community of practice of fall prevention advocates.
