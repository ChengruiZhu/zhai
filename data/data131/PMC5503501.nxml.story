Herein, DNA duplex was constructed through the hybridization of adenosine triphosphate (ATP)-responsive aptamer and its cDNA in which GC-rich motif could be used to load doxorubicin (DOX), and then, cationic polymer PEI25K was used as a carrier to simultaneously condense DOX-Duplex and Bcl-2 siRNA to prepare the ternary nanocomplex polyethylenimine (PEI)/DOX-Duplex/siRNA. The ATP concentration gradient between the cytosol and extracellular environment could achieve the stable loading of DOX in duplex and the rapid drug release in an ATP-responsive manner. Using human prostate tumor cell line PC-3 as a model, an obvious induction of cell proliferation could be detected with a cell viability of 53.3%, which was stronger than single cargo delivery, indicating the synergistic effect between these two components. The enhanced anti-proliferative effect of ternary nanocomplex could be attributed to the improved induction of cell apoptosis in a mitochondria-mediated pathway and cell-cycle arrest at the G2 phase. Overall, the ATP-responsive nanocarrier for co-delivering DOX and Bcl-2 siRNA has been demonstrated to be a smart delivery system with favorable anti-proliferative effect, especially for solving the multidrug resistance of tumors.
