Hypospadias is the most common anomaly in the male genital tract with an incidence of 0.8–8.2 per 1000 live male births. Routinely, hypospadias cases are repaired after one year of age, and it is recommended that a child with hypospadias not to be circumcised until hypospadias repair is completed. This study was conducted to determine whether or not circumcision prior to hypospadias repair increases the risk of complications. 30 circumcised patients and 30 persons without a history of circumcision and hypospadias were enrolled in this study and underwent surgery for hypospadias repair. The results of surgery compared between two groups. In the uncircumcised group, the mean durations of surgery and hospitalization were 55.61 ± 58.11 min and 3.17 ± 1.79 days. In circumcised group, the mean duration of surgery and hospitalization were 66.17 ± 33.65 minutes and 3.7 ± 1.62 days. There was no significant difference between these criteria and other complications of the two groups. This study shows that postoperative complications in circumcised distal hypospadias patients do not increase. Cosmetic and functional results were excellent. If there are failures in therapy and in case of postoperative complications, it is better to notice other factors such as infection.
