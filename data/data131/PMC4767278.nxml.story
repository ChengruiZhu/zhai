When entrained using repetitive stimulation, sensory cortices appear to respond maximally, or resonate, at different driving frequencies: 10Hz in visual cortex; 20Hz and 40Hz in somatosensory and auditory cortices, respectively. The resonance frequencies are inversely correlated to the cortical volume of the respective regions, but it is unclear what drives this relationship. Here we used both computational and empirical data to demonstrate that resonance frequencies are emergent properties of the connectivity parameters of the underlying networks. The experimental paradigm stimulated large and small areas of visual cortex with different size objects made of flickering dots, and varied the driving frequency. Larger cortical areas exhibited maximum response at lower frequency than smaller areas, suggesting the inverse relationship between cortical size and resonance frequency holds, even within the same sensory modality. Computationally, we simulated cortical patches of different sizes and varied their connectivity parameters. We demonstrate that the size of the activated network is inversely related to its resonance frequency and that this change is due to the increased transmission delay and greater node degree within the larger network. The results are important for understanding the functional significance of oscillatory processes, and as a tool for probing changes in functional connectivity.
