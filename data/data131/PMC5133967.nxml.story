Increasing evidence indicates that sirtuin 1 (SIRT1) is implicated in a wide range of cellular functions, such as oxidative stress, inflammation and apoptosis. The aim of this study was to investigate the change of SIRT1 in the brain after subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) and its role on SAH-induced early brain injury (EBI). In the first set of experiments, rats were randomly divided into sham group and SAH groups at 2, 6, 12, 24, 48 and 72 h. The expression of SIRT1 was evaluated by western blot analysis, immunohistochemistry and immunofluorescence. In another set of experiments, SIRT1-specific inhibitor (sirtinol) and activator (activator 3) were exploited to study the role of SIRT1 in SAH-induced EBI. It showed that the protein level of SIRT1 was markedly elevated at the early stage of SAH and peaked at 24 h after SAH. The expression of SIRT1 could be observed in neurons and microglia, and the enhanced SIRT1 was mainly located in neurons after SAH. Administration of sirtinol inhibited the expression and activation of SIRT1 pathways after SAH, while activator 3 enhanced the expression and activation of SIRT1 pathways after SAH. In addition, inhibition of SIRT1 could exacerbate forkhead transcription factors of the O class-, nuclear factor-kappa B- and p53-induced oxidative damage, neuroinflammation and neuronal apoptosis, leading to aggravated brain injury after SAH. In contrast, activator 3 treatment could reduce forkhead transcription factors of the O class-, nuclear factor-kappa B-, and p53-induced oxidative damage, neuroinflammation and neuronal apoptosis to protect against EBI. These results suggest that SIRT1 plays an important role in neuroprotection against EBI after SAH by deacetylation and subsequent inhibition of forkhead transcription factors of the O class-, nuclear factor-kappa B-, and p53-induced oxidative, inflammatory and apoptotic pathways. SIRT1 might be a new promising molecular target for SAH.
