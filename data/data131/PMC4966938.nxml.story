Liver metastasis from colorectal cancer confers a poor patient prognosis and is often manifested as multiple independent lesions. Clonal evolution is an important biological process in metastatic development, but the magnitude and clinical relevance of genetic heterogeneity among metastatic deposits in individual patients remains unknown. We describe for the first time a large variation among patients in the level of inter-metastatic heterogeneity at the DNA copy number level in liver metastases from colorectal cancer. We found this heterogeneity to be a biological feature independent both of the number of metastases per patient and of the extent of copy number aberrations (genomic complexity)of the metastases. Previous chemotherapy exposure was associated with a higher patient-wise level of heterogeneity in subsequent metastases. Importantly, we discovered inter-metastatic heterogeneity to be a key determinant of patient survival and a stronger prognostic factor than known clinicopathological parameters of metastatic colorectal cancer. This study reinforces the clinical relevance of tumor heterogeneity and we identify inter-metastatic heterogeneity as an important feature to explore in future cohorts of patients with metastatic colorectal cancer.
