Overweight and obese adults were more likely to report low levels of physical activity (≤967.5 MET.mins/wk) (‘Overweight’-OR [95% CI]: 1.23 [1.20 to 1.26], ‘Obese I’ 1.66 [1.61–1.71], ‘Obese II’ 2.21 [2.12–2.30], and ‘Obese III’ 3.13 [2.95 to 3.23]) compared to ‘Normal weight’ adults. The odds of reporting high TV viewing (3 h/day) was greater in ‘Overweight’ (1.52 [1.48 to 1.55]) and obese adults (‘Obese I’ 2.06 [2.00–2.12], ‘Obese II’ 2.69 [2.58–2.80], ‘Obese III’ 3.26 [3.07 to 3.47]), and poor sleep duration (<7, >8 h/night) was higher in ‘Overweight’ (1.09 [1.07 to 1.12]) and obese adults (‘Obese I’ 1.31 [1.27–1.34], ‘Obese II’ 1.50 [1.44–1.56], ‘Obese III’ (1.78 [1.68 to 1.89]) compared to the ‘Normal weight’ group. These lifestyle behaviours were clustered, the odds of reporting simultaneous low physical activity, high TV viewing and poor sleep (unhealthy behavioural phenotype) was higher than reporting these behaviours independently, in overweight and obese groups. ‘Obese III’ adults were almost six times more likely (5.47 [4.96 to 6.05]) to report an unhealthy behavioural phenotype compared to the ‘Normal weight’ group.
