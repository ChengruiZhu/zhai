OBJECTIVE: To assess the frequency of infertility after pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) and factors important in postinfectious tubal damage in an urban population at high risk for sexually transmitted diseases. METHODS: From a cohort of 213 women with PID documented by laparoscopy and/or endometrial biopsy, 58 women (27% of the initial cohort) were interviewed by phone 2 to 9 years after an index episode of PID. Data regarding the initial history, physical examination, microbiology, laparoscopic, and serologic findings, and data concerning interval contraception, subsequent pregnancy, subsequent infection, and chronic pelvic pain were compared among those with and without infertility at follow up. RESULTS: Nineteen (40%) of the 48 women not using contraception were involuntarily infertile after the index episode of PID. Compared with those who had an interval pregnancy, infertile women were older (P = 0.02), more likely to have a history of infertility prior to the index episode of PID (P = 0.001), and were more likely to have occluded or partially occluded fallopian tubes (P = 0.03), peritubal adhesions (P = 0.007), or perihepatic adhesions (P = 0.02) seen by laparoscopy performed during the index episode. Surprisingly, recovery of Chlamydia trachomatis was negatively related to infertility (P = 0.001), although a similar proportion of both groups had chlamydia immunoglobulin M antibody (40% vs. 31%). Chlamydia heat shock protein was weakly related to infertility (P = 0.08). The isolation of Neisseria gonorrhoeae was not significantly different between groups (53% vs. 57%). CONCLUSIONS: The high rate of postinfection infertility found was probably related to a combination of tubal damage before and during the index episode of PID. Prevention of recurrent PID and better understanding of the pathophysiology of postinfection tubal damage (which may differ between chlamydia and gonorrhea) is needed to develop more effective strategies to reduce permanent tubal damage.
