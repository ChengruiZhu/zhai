OIC-A006 (BMPs osteogenesis compounds), can stimulate bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells ALP, OPN, OC, Cbfal expression. To stimulate new bone formation in the body. We postulate different amounts of drug microspheres on the PLGA/β-CPT scaffold can produce the effects on performance and sustained release characteristics. In this paper, through adding different amount of carrier drug microsphere, three concentrations scaffolds which are 12.5, 18.75 and 25 μmol/L are prepared by adding different amounts of drug-loaded microspheres. Hereafter called OICM/CPT-200, OICM/CPT-300, OICM/CPT-400. We implant them in rat femur diameter 3 mm depth of 3 mm hole for eight weeks. The degradation, microsphere, delivery properties, with X-ray, micro-CT and histology are tested. Results show that the contain carrier drug microsphere scaffolds become radiopaque, and the gaps between the scaffold and radial cut ends are often invisible. This preliminary study reveals that different carrier drug microsphere has a corresponding effect the performance of stent body, OICM/CPT – 200 scaffolds induction effect is best. Illustrates that the low concentration load OIC-A006 microspheres can promote bone healing, and high concentration of OIC-A006 micro ball is played a inhibitory effect on bone healing process.
