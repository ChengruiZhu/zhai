 Characteristic cytoplasmic inclusions (myelin figures), consisting of concentric multilaminar paired membranes surrounding one or more lipid bodies, were produced in rat liver parenchymal cells by incorporating high doses of an anticonvulsant agent (Bax 422Z) into the animals' diet. Enzymatic reaction product (presumably lead phosphate) was found around the central fat of these myelin figures in liver which had been fixed in glutaraldehyde, incubated in Wachstein and Meisel's medium containing adenosine triphosphate or inosine tri- or diphosphate, postosmicated, embedded in epoxy resin, and examined in the electron microscope. In an attempt to isolate myelin figures, fresh liver from medicated rats was homogenized and differentially centrifuged. Thin sections of osmium tetroxide-fixed, Epon-embedded pellets from each fraction were examined with the electron microscope. The concentric membranous whorls, which are probably derived from cisternae of the endoplasmic reticulum, broke up as the cells were disrupted and became inextricably mixed with the microsomal fraction. However, when liver previously fixed in formalin for 24 hours was homogenized, the myelin figures remained intact.
