Proteins evolved from a common ancestor are said to be homologues and to constitute a “family” with potentially similar structures, functions, and interactions. The problem of identifying “real” protein families based on amino acid sequence conservation has been the subject of extensive debate, because algorithms that search for pairwise homologies can miss important relations and produce false hits. The availability of a large number of sequenced genomes now allows us to map the full set of protein similarity relationships into a Protein Homology Network (PHN), and protein families appear naturally as dense, highly connected regions of the network. In this study, Medini, Covacci, and Donati describe a new method that identifies these regions of the PHN, and generate a set of protein families (PHN-Families) that correlate with protein function and phylogeny, with a quality comparable to family sets curated by human experts. The method is completely unsupervised and can be applied to any number of genomes. The authors test the biological relevance of the PHN-Families obtained by studying the members of Type III and Type IV secretion systems, showing that this classification can also be used to identify the evolutionary events that led to the formation of multiprotein structures.
