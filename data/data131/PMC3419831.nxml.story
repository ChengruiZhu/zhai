The outcome of patients with advanced soft tissue sarcomas (STS) has not improved much during the last decade. Apart from non-pleomorphic rhabdomyosarcoma, adjuvant chemotherapy has no standard role in high risk STS. In metastatic disease little progress has been made, but during recent years much effort has been put into the development of better clinical study protocols, with stratification of patients to at least the most common histological subtypes, preventing the dilution of potential treatment efficacy when measuring results over the total heterogeneous group of STS. The outcome of patients with advanced STS is however not only dependent on the introduction of new drugs, but also on the availability of dedicated sarcoma centers in which multidisciplinary teams with the input of all experts from different disciplines, such as pathology, radiology, nuclear medicine, surgery, orthopedics radiotherapy and medical oncology is present. Long delay, wrong histological diagnoses, under- and overtreatment are not in the favor of these patients, neither with regard to outcome, nor with respect to short- and long-term toxicity. Disappointedly, centralization is not a routine part of daily care of STS patients and their care givers. Patient advocacy groups are more and more aware of the relevance of treatment in centers of expertise and are active in guiding the patients to these hospitals. At the same time the sarcoma centers should be pro-active in putting patients into clinical trials, also for rare indications within the STS group, as only in this way a better outcome for this group of patients can be reached.
