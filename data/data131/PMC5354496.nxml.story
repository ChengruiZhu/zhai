Soluble ligands have commonly been targeted by antibody therapeutics for cancers and other diseases. Although monoclonal antibodies targeting such ligands can block their interactions with their cognate receptors, they can also significantly increase the half-life of their ligands by FcRn-mediated antibody recycling, thereby evading ligand renal clearance and requiring increasingly high antibody doses to neutralize the increasing pool of target. To overcome this issue, we generated a bispecific/biparatopic antibody (BiSAb) that targets two different epitopes on IL-6 to block IL-6-mediated signaling. The BiSAb formed large immune complexes with IL-6 that can bind Fcγ receptors on phagocytic cells and are rapidly internalized. In addition, rapid clearance of the BiSAb·IL-6 complex was observed in mice while the parental antibodies prolonged the serum half-life of IL-6. Intravital imaging of the liver in mice confirmed that the rapid clearance of these large immune complexes was associated with Fcγ receptor-dependent binding to Kupffer cells in the liver. The approach described here provides a general strategy for therapeutic antibodies with the ability to not only neutralize but also actively drive clearance of their soluble antigens.
