Pseudoaneurysms rarely occur as a serious complication following incomplete hemostasis of an arterial puncture site. As a result of the increase in diagnostic and therapeutic angiography, the frequency of iatrogenic pseudoaneurysm has increased as well. Iatrogenic pseudoaneurysms associated with angiographic catheterization occur most commonly in the common femoral artery. Here we report a case of iatrogenic superficial external pudendal artery (SEPA) pseudoaneurysm following cardiac catheterization, which was diagnosed with Doppler ultrasound (US) and multidetector computed tomographic angiography (MDCTA) before Doppler US-guided compression therapy. To the best of our knowledge, iatrogenic SEPA pseudoaneurysm, which is an unusual vessel location for pseudoaneurysm occurrence, has not been reported in the literature. In patients in whom anticoagulant-thrombolytic therapy or therapeutic catheterization with larger sized sheath is planned, determination of the precise localization of arterial puncture site is important for the prevention of iatrogenic pseudoaneurysm development. Arterial puncture guided with Doppler US might reduce complications. When suspected, MDCTA is useful in the diagnosis and demonstration of iatrogenic pseudoaneurysms. Treatment of US-guided compression should be the first choice for iatrogenic pseudoaneurysms. Interventional radiologists and cardiologists should have enough experience about the catheterization complications and their treatment in order to decrease the morbidity and mortality related to the intervention.
