Four‐dimensional, cone‐beam CT (4D CBCT) substantially reduces respiration‐induced motion blurring artifacts in three‐dimension (3D) CBCT. However, the image quality of 4D CBCT is significantly degraded which may affect its accuracy in localizing a mobile tumor for high‐precision, image‐guided radiation therapy (IGRT). The purpose of this study was to investigate the impact of scanning parameters (hereinafter collectively referred to as scanning sequence) and breathing patterns on the image quality and the accuracy of computed tumor trajectory for a commercial 4D CBCT system, in preparation for its clinical implementation. We simulated a series of periodic and aperiodic sinusoidal breathing patterns with a respiratory motion phantom. The aperiodic pattern was created by varying the period or amplitude of individual sinusoidal breathing cycles. 4D CBCT scans of the phantom were acquired with a manufacturer‐supplied scanning sequence (4D‐S‐slow) and two in‐house modified scanning sequences (4D‐M‐slow and 4D‐M‐fast). While 4D‐S‐slow used small field of view (FOV), partial rotation (200°), and no imaging filter, 4D‐M‐slow and 4D‐M‐fast used medium FOV, full rotation, and the F1 filter. The scanning speed was doubled in 4D‐M‐fast (100°/min gantry rotation). The image quality of the 4D CBCT scans was evaluated using contrast‐to‐noise ratio (CNR), signal‐to‐noise ratio (SNR), and motion blurring ratio (MBR). The trajectory of the moving target was reconstructed by registering each phase of the 4D CBCT with a reference CT. The root‐mean‐squared‐error (RMSE) analysis was used to quantify its accuracy. Significant decrease in CNR and SNR from 3D CBCT to 4D CBCT was observed. The 4D‐S‐slow and 4D‐M‐fast scans had comparable image quality, while the 4D‐M‐slow scans had better performance due to doubled projections. Both CNR and SNR decreased slightly as the breathing period increased, while no dependence on the amplitude was observed. The difference of both CNR and SNR between periodic and aperiodic breathing patterns was insignificant (
