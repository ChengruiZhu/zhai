Many prominent diseases, most notably cancer, arise from an imbalance between the rates of cell growth and death in the body. This is often due to mutations that disrupt a cell death program called apoptosis. Here, we focus on the extrinsic pathway of apoptotic activation which is initiated upon detection of an external death signal, encoded by a death ligand, by its corresponding death receptor. Through the tools of mathematical analysis, we find that a novel model of death ligand-receptor interactions based on recent experimental data possesses the capacity for bistability. Consequently, the model supports threshold-like switching between unambiguous life and death states; intuitively, the defining characteristic of an effective cell death mechanism. We thus highlight the role of death receptors, the first component along the apoptotic pathway, in deciding cell fate. Furthermore, the model suggests an explanation for various biologically observed phenomena, including the trimeric character of the death ligand and the tendency for death receptors to colocalize, in terms of bistability. Our work hence informs the molecular basis of the apoptotic point-of-no-return, and may influence future drug therapies against cancer and other diseases.
