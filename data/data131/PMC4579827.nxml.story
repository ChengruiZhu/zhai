The expression of T-box transcription factor 5 (TBX5) has previously been observed in human cancer. The aim of the present study was to investigate TBX5 expression and its potential clinical significance in gastric cancer (GC). Using reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction, the TBX5 mRNA expression levels in 30 pairs of surgically resected healthy gastric tissues and early stage (stages I and II) GC tissues were evaluated. The TBX5 mRNA expression levels were increased in GC stage I and II tumor tissues (P=0.01, n=30) compared with the matched adjacent non-tumor tissue. However, no significant difference was observed in TBX5 mRNA expression levels in matched adjacent non-tumor tissue compared with the tumor tissue from stage III and IV GC samples (P=0.318, n=30). Immunohistochemical analysis for TBX5 expression was performed on 161 paraffin-embedded stage I and II GC tissue blocks. Statistical analysis was performed to evaluate the associations between TBX5 expression, clinicopathological factors and prognosis. Patients with stage I and II GC and tumors with high TBX5 expression levels presented poor overall survival (OS) rate (P=0.024). The Cox proportional hazards model analysis demonstrated that TBX5 expression was an independent risk factor (P=0.017). The present study indicates that high expression of TBX5 is associated with unfavorable OS rates in patients with stage I and II GC. In conclusion, the expression of TBX5 may be a valuable biomarker for the selection of cases of high-risk stage I and II GC.
