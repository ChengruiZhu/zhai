An iterative method is proposed to calibrate radiation sensitivities of an arbitrary two‐dimensional (2D) array of detectors. The array is irradiated with a wide open‐field beam at the central position, as well as at laterally and longitudinal shifted positions; the 2D beam profile of the wide field is reconstructed iteratively from the ratios of shifted images to the central image. The propagation errors due to output variation and inaccurate array positioning are estimated and removed from the reconstructed beam profile by an error‐locking scheme with narrow open‐field irradiations. The beam profile is interpolated when necessary and then compared to raw detector responses to determine sensitivities. Two additional methods were implemented for comparison: 1) the commercial iterative calibration method for MapCHECK2 with translation and rotation operations; 2) a labor‐intensive noniterative method without the issue of error propagation. A MapCHECK2 2D detector array was used to validate the proposed method with the 6 MV photon beam from a Varian iX linear accelerator. All calibration methods were repeated three times. A total of 5, 9, and 29 irradiations were required to implement the commercial method, the proposed method and the noniterative method respectively. Moreover, a 5 mm positioning error was intentionally introduced into the calibration procedures of the commercial and the proposed method to test their robustness. Under the normal operation condition of the linear accelerator and with careful alignment of the MapCHECK2, the deviations of the calibrated sensitivities of the proposed method and commercial method with respect to the noniterative method were
