We analyzed 829 consecutive patients from January 2004 to April 2013 in our internal New England–based Partners TeleStroke Network for a derivation cohort, and 332 cases for internal validation. External validation was performed on 226 cases from January 2008 to August 2012 in the Partners National TeleStroke Network. A predictive score was developed using stepwise logistic regression, and its performance was assessed using receiver‐operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis. There were 23% SM in the derivation, 24% in the internal, and 22% in external validation cohorts based on final clinical diagnosis. Compared to those with ischemic cerebrovascular disease (iCVD), SM had lower mean age, fewer vascular risk factors, more frequent prior seizure, and a different profile of presenting symptoms. The TeleStroke Mimic Score (TM‐Score) was based on factors independently associated with SM status including age, medical history (atrial fibrillation, hypertension, seizures), facial weakness, and National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale >14. The TM‐Score performed well on ROC curve analysis (derivation cohort AUC=0.75, internal validation AUC=0.71, external validation AUC=0.77).
