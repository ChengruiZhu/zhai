Hyperoxaluria after Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) increases the risk for kidney injury. Medical therapies for hyperoxaluria have limited efficacy. A 65-year-old female was evaluated for acute kidney injury [AKI, serum creatinine (Cr) 2.1 mg/dl, baseline Cr 1.0 mg/dl]. She did not have any urinary or gastrointestinal symptoms or exposure to nephrotoxic agents. Sixteen months prior to this evaluation, she underwent RYGB for morbid obesity. Her examination was unremarkable for hypertension or edema and there was no protein or blood on urine dipstick. Kidney biopsy revealed acute tubulointerstitial nephritis with oxalate crystals in tubules. The concurrent finding of severe hyperoxaluria (urine oxalate 150 mg/day) confirmed the diagnosis of oxalate nephropathy. Despite medical management of hyperoxaluria, her AKI worsened. Laparoscopic reversal of RYGB was performed and within 1 month, her hyperoxaluria resolved (urine oxalate 20 mg/day) and AKI improved (Cr 1.7 mg/dl). Surgical reversal of RYGB may be considered in patients with oxalate nephropathy at high risk of progression who fail medical therapy. Physicians need to be aware of the possibility of oxalate nephropathy after RYGB and promptly treat the hyperoxaluria to halt further kidney damage.
