In order to provide an effective way to prevent or substantially delay the recurrence of invasive meningioma, and improve the curative effect of surgical treatment, we collected and analyzed the clinical manifestations, pathological features, preoperative imaging characteristics as well the data obtained during the surgical treatment of invasive meningioma. From February 2014 to February 2016, 59 patients with invasive meningioma were enrolled in this study. Invasive meningioma was confirmed in all patients by operation. Information about clinical manifestations, pathological features, preoperative imaging and surgical treatment were collected and analyzed. After surgery, pathological specimens were collected, and cases were confirmed as invasive meningioma by pathological examination. The course of disease ranged from 15 days to 7 years (average, 13.2 months). We used World Health Organization (WHO) criteria for classification of meningioma in the nervous system tumors as our reference. Symptoms were as follows: Intracranial hypertension (29 cases), cranial nerve dysfunction (10 cases), epilepsy (11 cases) and other symptoms (9 cases). We had 56 cases of WHO grade I; 6 cases of WHO grade II and 7 cases of WHO grade III. Surgical removal was: Simpson grade I (56 cases), Simpson grade II (2 cases), Simpson grade III and above (56 cases). We used before surgery imaging data to formulate our surgical plan. In general, during surgeries we did not proceed to complete resection, because in the majority of cases, some key structures were invaded and meningioma was very deep and any attempt for total resection could easily lead to significant damage to these structures.
