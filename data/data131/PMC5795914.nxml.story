We investigated the short- and long-term efficacy of thoracoscope-assisted segmental resection of lung of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). We selected a total of 94 patients with lung cancer in the early stage who were admitted to The First People's Hospital of Xuzhou for treatment between March 2011 and February 2012. Patients were divided randomly into either the control group (n=47) or the observation group (n=47). In the observation group, patients received thoracoscope-assisted segmental resection of lung, while in the control group, the conventional thoracic surgery was performed for treatment. After surgeries, we observed the incidence rate of complications among the two groups, and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was adopted to detect levels of inflammatory factors. We also compared the cardiac and pulmonary functions, the levels of immunoglobulins and subgroups of T lymphocytes in the peripheral blood of the patients. In addition, all patients attended a 5-year follow-up to determine the recurrence and survival rate. Compared to the control group, patients in the observation group had significantly less intra-operative bleeding volume, a shorter duration of surgery, and suffered slighter pain after surgery (P<0.05). After surgery, the incidence rate of complications in the observation group was significantly lower than that in the control group (P<0.05). After surgeries, patients in both groups experienced a remarkable improvement in cardiac and pulmonary functions, and the improvement in the observation group was superior to that of the control group (P<0.05). During the 5-year follow-up, the survival rate of the observation group is significantly higher than that in thecontrol group, and patients in the observation group experienced a lower recurrence rate than those in the control group (P<0.05). Thus, thoracoscope-assisted segmental resection of lung is of great significance in clinical practice.
