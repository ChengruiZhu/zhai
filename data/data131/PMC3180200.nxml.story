The cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes are important in many areas, including pharmaceutical development. Subtle changes in the electronic structure of the active species, Compound I, have been postulated previously to account partly for the experimentally observed differences in reactivity between isoforms. Current predictive models of CYP metabolism typically assume an identical Compound I in all isoforms. Here we present a method to calculate the electronic structure and to estimate the Feâ€“O bond enthalpy of Compound I, and apply it to several human and bacterial CYP isoforms. Conformational flexibility is accounted for by sampling large numbers of structures from molecular dynamics simulations, which are subsequently optimized with density functional theory (B3LYP) based quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics. The observed differences in Compound I between human isoforms are small: They are generally smaller than the spread of values obtained for the same isoform starting from different initial structures. Hence, it is unlikely that the variation in activity between human isoforms is due to differences in the electronic structure of Compound I. A larger difference in electronic structure is observed between the human isoforms and P450
