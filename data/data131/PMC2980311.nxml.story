 pipette solution, depolarizing steps positive to −40 mV evoked an outward current that showed kinetics and voltage dependence of activation and inactivation typical of the delayed rectifier potassium current. This was blocked by the nonspecific delayed rectifier blocker 4-aminopyridine. The synoviocytes expressed mRNA for four Kv1 subtypes (Kv1.1, Kv1.4, Kv1.5, and Kv1.6). Correolide (1 μM), margatoxin (100 nM), and α-dendrotoxin block these Kv1 subtypes, and all of these drugs significantly reduced synoviocyte outward current. The current was blocked most effectively by 50 nM κ-dendrotoxin, which is specific for channels containing a Kv1.1 subunit, indicating that Kv1.1 is critical, either as a homomultimeric channel or as a component of a heteromultimeric Kv1 channel. When 50 nM κ-dendrotoxin was added to current-clamped synoviocytes, the cells depolarized by >20 mV and this was accompanied by an increase in intracellular calcium concentration. Similarly, depolarization of the cells with high external potassium solution caused an increase in intracellular calcium, and this effect was greatly reduced by 1 μM nifedipine. In conclusion, fibroblast-like synoviocytes cultured from the inner synovium of the rabbit exhibit voltage-dependent inward and outward currents, including Ca
