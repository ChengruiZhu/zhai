During S-phase of the cell cycle, chromosomal DNA is replicated in a complex process involving the coordinated activity of thousands of replication forks, each of which duplicates a long stretch of DNA. Recent experiments revealed that the genome is replicating as a mosaic of large-scale early and late chromosomal domains and that this high-level domain organization is correlated with genomic properties like gene density and nucleotide composition. We compared genome-wide replication time maps of compatible human and mouse cells and revealed that their organization into replication domains is highly conserved despite the numerous large-scale genome rearrangements separating the two species. Analysis of recent chromosomal interaction data shows that regions with similar time of replication are more frequently interacting with each other than expected. The data also show that evolutionary rearrangements have predominantly occurred between regions that have similar time of replication and higher-than-expected chromosomal proximity. Our data suggests that the genome, while being continuously rearranged by evolution, maintains a conserved domain organization. Whether this conservation is driven by selection, or is a consequence of the rearrangement process itself, can be resolved by enhancing the comparative approach proposed here.
