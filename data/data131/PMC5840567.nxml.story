Immunotherapy with anti-programmed cell death protein 1 or programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1) agents has demonstrated promising efficacy for the treatment of various types of malignancies. However, the role of PD-L1 as a tumor prognostic marker remains poorly understood. In the present study, the prognostic value of PD-L1 expression in esophageal carcinoma (EC) following definitive chemoradiotherapy (CRT) was investigated, and its associations with three systemic inflammation biomarkers, neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR), platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio (PLR) and lymphocyte-to-monocyte ratio (LMR) were further explored. A total of 104 patients with non-metastatic EC, who underwent definitive CRT between January 2009 and December 2012, were retrospectively analyzed. The expression of PD-L1 was examined by immunohistochemistry and the impact of PD-L1 expression level on overall survival (OS) was assessed. Furthermore, pretreatment neutrophil, lymphocyte, platelet and monocyte counts were obtained from routine blood tests to calculate the NLR, PLR and LMR. PD-L1 was overexpressed in EC compared with normal esophageal epithelium, with a positive expression rate of 37.5%. Additionally, patients with positive PD-L1 expression had a lower NLR than those with negative PD-L1 expression (P=0.001). On multivariate analysis, the positive staining of PD-L1 was significantly associated with improved OS (HR, 0.6; 95% CI, 0.372–0.965; P=0.035). Kaplan-Meier survival analysis showed a similar result (P=0.009). Additionally, sex (HR, 0.449; 95% CI, 0.229–0.880; P=0.020), clinical stage III (HR, 2.471; 95% CI, 1.171–5.212; P=0.018), and receipt of concurrent chemoradiation (HR, 0.590; 95% CI, 0.368–0.945; P=0.028) were all independent prognostic factors in EC treated with definitive CRT. The correlation of NLR with PD-L1 expression validated the relevance of immunity and inflammation. In summary, the present study demonstrated that positive PD-L1 expression is associated with improved survival in patients with EC treated with radical CRT, indicating that PD-L1 is a promising prognostic marker.
