Lung cancer is a leading cause of cancer-related mortalities worldwide. In the present study, a comparison of To determine the roles of ARHGAP10 in the proliferation, migration and invasion of lung cancer cells expression levels between normal lung tissues and lung cancer tissues were compared using immunoblotting, and CCK-8 and Transwell assays. Lung cancer tissues had a decreased ARHGAP10 mRNA expression level compared to the adjacent normal tissues. The ectopic expression of ARHGAP10 significantly suppressed the migration, invasion and proliferation of lung cancer cells. Gene set enrichment analysis revealed that metastasis and Wnt signaling pathways were negatively correlated with ARHGAP10 expression. Immunoblotting analysis revealed that ARHGAP10 overexpression inhibited metastasis [matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-2, MMP-9 and VEGF] and the expression of Wnt pathway-related proteins (β-catenin and c-Myc). Moreover, the stimulation effects of lithium chloride, a GSK3β inhibitor, on the accumulation of β-catenin were notably suppressed by ARHGAP10 overexpression. Collectively, ARHGAP10 acts to suppress tumor within lung cancer by affecting metastasis and Wnt signaling pathways. The results therefore suggest that ARHGAP10 is a potentially attractive target for the treatment of lung cancer.
