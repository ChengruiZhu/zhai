 which are highly immunogenic in different animal models. We have shown recently that recombinant VP6 nanotubes have an adjuvant effect on immunogenicity of NoV VLPs in mice. In this study, we investigated if the adjuvant effect is dependent upon a VP6 dose or different VP6 structural assemblies. In addition, local and systemic adjuvant effects as well as requirements for antigen co‐delivery and co‐localization were studied. The magnitude and functionality of NoV GII.4‐specific antibodies and T cell responses were tested in mice immunized with GII.4 VLPs alone or different combinations of VLPs and VP6. A VP6 dose‐dependent adjuvant effect on GII.4‐specific antibody responses was observed. The adjuvant effect was found to be strictly dependent upon co‐administration of NoV GII.4 VLPs and VP6 at the same anatomic site and at the same time. However, the adjuvant effect was not dependent on the types of oligomers used, as both nanotubes and nanospheres exerted adjuvant effect on GII.4‐specific antibody generation and, for the first time, T cell immunity. These findings elucidate the mechanisms of VP6 adjuvant effect in vivo and support its use as an adjuvant in a combination NoV and RV vaccine.
