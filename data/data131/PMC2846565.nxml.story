Antiplatelet antibodies are known to be present in a wide spectrum of patients, which include chronic Idiopathic Thrombocytopenic Purpura (ITP), infections, etc., including Glanzmann's thrombasthenia (GT) patients who receive multiple platelet transfusions. The presence of natural antibodies to platelet receptors is not studied in cases of GT. We studied the antiplatelet antibodies in 23 patients with GT, 15 of which had received multiple transfusions and eight that had not received transfusions, along with 50 cases of chronic ITP. The prevalence and specificity of platelet-bound antibodies were detected by inhibition assays using O-group platelets on flow cytometry. The mean antiplatelet antibodies in 15 patients of GT who had not received transfusions and eight patients with multiple transfusions was 8427 + 2131.88 and 9038 + 2856 antibodies/platelet, respectively, while in case of the 50 ITP patients studied, it was 22166 + 5616 antibodies/platelet (Normal Range 1500â€“3200 antibodies/platelet). We conclude that GT patients who have not received transfusions may develop antiplatelet antibodies to the missing/abnormal receptor. Whether this is due to a molecular mimicry or due to some other mechanism needs to be explored.
