The rabbit has great commercial importance as a source of meat and fur, as well as its uses as a laboratory animal for the production of antibodies, used to detect the presence or absence of disease and for research in infectious diseases and immunology. One of the most critical problems in immunology is to understand how the immune system detects the presence of infectious agents and disposes the invader without destroying the self-tissues. Genetic characterization of Toll-like receptors has established that innate immunity is a skillful system that detects invasion of microbial pathogens. Our work aimed to identify, clone and express the Oryctolagus cuniculus (rabbit) TLR-1 mRNA and its encoding protein. We cloned the complete mRNA sequence of Oryctolagus cuniculus TLR-1 and deposit it in the GenBank under accession number (KC349941), which has 2388 base pair and it encodes encode an open reading frame (ORF) translated into 796 amino acids mRNA and consist of 20 types of amino acids. The analysis of amino acid sequence revealed that the rabbit TLR-1 has a typical protein components belonging to the TLR family. Rabbit TLR-1 was expressed in a wide variety of rabbit tissues, which indicate an important role in immune system in different organs.
