Computational modeling aims to use mathematical and algorithmic principles to link components of biological systems to predict system behavior. In the past such models have described a small set of carefully studied molecular interactions (proteins in signal transduction pathways) or larger abstract components (cell types or functional processes in the immune system). In this study we use data from global transcriptional analysis of the processes of neuroprotection in a mouse model of stroke to generate functional modules, groups of genes that coherently act to accomplish functions. We then derive equations relating the expression of these modules to one another, treating these individual equations as a closed system, and demonstrate that the model can be used to simulate the gene expression of the system over time. Our work is novel in describing the use of global transcriptomic data to develop dynamic models of expression in an animal model. We believe that the models developed will aid in understanding the complex dynamics of neuroprotection and provide ways to predict outcomes in terms of neuroprotection or injury. This approach will be broadly applicable to other problems and provides an approach to building dynamic models from the bottom up.
