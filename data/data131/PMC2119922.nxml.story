Interleukin 10 (IL-10) suppressed TGF-beta synthesis in mouse bone marrow cultures. Coincidingly, IL-10 down-regulated the production of bone proteins including alkaline phosphatase (ALP), collagen and osteocalcin, and the formation of mineralized extracellular matrix. The mAb 1D11.16 which neutralizes TGF-beta 1 and TGF-beta 2, induced suppressive effects comparable to IL-10 when administered before the increase of cell proliferation in the culture. It appears that mainly TGF-beta 1 plays a role in this system since (a) TGF-beta 2 levels were undetectable in supernatants from osteogenic cultures, (b) no effect was observed when the anti-TGF-beta 2 neutralizing mAb 4C7.11 was added and (c) the suppressive effect of IL-10 could be reversed by adding exogenous TGF-beta 1. It is unlikely that TGF-beta 1 modulates osteogenic differentiation by changing the proliferative potential of marrow cells since 1D11.16 did not affect [3H]thymidine ([3H]TdR) incorporation or the number of fibroblast colony forming cells (CFU-F) which harbor the osteoprogenitor cell population. Furthermore, 1D11.16 did not alter [3H]TdR uptake by the cloned osteoprogenitor cell lines MN7 and MC3T3. Light and scanning electron microscopy showed that IL-10 and 1D11.16 induced comparable morphological changes in the marrow cultures. Control cultures contained flat adherent cells embedded in a mineralized matrix. In contrast, IL-10 and 1D11.16 treated cultures were characterized by round non-adherent cells and the absence of a mineralized matrix. In this study, the mechanism by which IL-10 suppresses the osteogenic differentiation of mouse bone marrow was identified as inhibition of TGF-beta 1 production which is essential for osteogenic commitment of bone marrow cells.
