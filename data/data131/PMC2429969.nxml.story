In DNA, information is encoded as a sequence of four types of building blocksâ€“nucleotides. The most common technique for determining such sequences, the Sanger method, outputs a single consensus for a pool of DNA molecules in the analyzed sample. When these are identical, each site in the output contains a single nucleotide call. Yet, samples from organisms with two sets of chromosomes generally contain two types of DNA molecules (alleles), each derived from one parent. If, due to insertion or deletion (indel) mutations, one allele contains extra nucleotides, most sites in the sequencing output beyond the mutation site will contain pairs of nucleotide calls. While signaling the presence of a potentially important mutation, such output cannot be read directly and often gets discarded. Here we describe an algorithmic method which accurately reconstructs the pair of allelic sequences from the observed complex pattern of calls. Unlike most existing computational approaches to the problem, our method does not require knowledge of one of the involved sequences to use as a reference, nor any other additional information. Therefore, it can facilitate sequencing of indel-rich regions of genomes and speed up discovery and characterization of indel mutations, including those causing diseases in humans.
