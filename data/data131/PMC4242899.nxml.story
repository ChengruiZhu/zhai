This report describes a patient with intravascular large B-cell lymphoma (IVLBCL) with central nervous system involvement at the time of diagnosis who achieved complete remission for over 5 years in response to therapy. The patient, a 71 year-old woman, was previously healthy with the exception of taking verapamil for paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia. She had presented with pyrexia and gradually progressive anemia. Brain magnetic resonance imaging revealed an infarct-like lesion in the pons, although no paralysis was observed. She was diagnosed with IVLBCL on the basis of random skin biopsy. After eight cycles of rituximab plus cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone therapy, abnormal laboratory data had normalized, and no pontine lesion was evident on magnetic resonance imaging without receiving any intrathecal chemotherapy. IVLBCL is associated with poor prognosis, particularly in patients with central nervous system involvement. Early initiation of rituximab plus cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone therapy and drug interactions between anticancer agents and verapamil as a p-glycoprotein inhibitor were considered the possible reasons for favorable outcome in the present case.
