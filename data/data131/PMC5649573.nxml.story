High-risk human papilloma virus (HPV) is the leading cause of cervical cancer. HPV oncogenes are responsible for the development of malignancy, and the E6 oncoprotein that HPV expresses induces the degradation of tumour suppressor protein p53 (p53). This degradation leads to the upregulation of p16; however, unidentified proteins may also serve a role in the development and progression of cervical cancer. Therefore, the aim of the present study was to analyse the expression levels of E6, p53, p16, MDM2 proto-oncogene (MDM2) and galectin-3 (gal-3) in cervical cancer specimens. A total of 250 cervical cancer tissue slides were used. The expression of E6, p53, p16, MDM2 and gal-3 was analysed with immunohistochemical methods and a semi-quantitative scoring. SPSS software was used for the statistical evaluation of staining results and survival analysis of patients with cervical cancer. Cervical cancer specimens demonstrated significantly increased E6 staining with advanced T-status and increased International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics classification. E6, p53 and p16 demonstrated significantly different expression levels in squamous epithelial tissue compared with adenocarcinomas. MDM2 and gal-3 demonstrated positively correlated expression levels in cervical cancer. In addition, gal-3 expression was correlated with poor prognosis in p16-negative cases. A negative correlation between the expression of E6 and a mutated form of p53 was also identified in cervical cancer. p53 mutation was demonstrated to be common in cervical cancer, and gal-3 and MDM2 appeared to act in a combined manner in this type of tumour. As gal-3 is overexpressed in the cervical cancer tissue of patients with poor prognosis, the use of gal-3 inhibitors should be investigated in future studies.
