Synchronization among multiple oscillators is a common theme in many biological and engineered systems. Here, we look at its use by the mammalian biological clock to keep accurate time. Through biochemical interactions among a network of inaccurate neuron clocks, a strong precise clock is produced. Although we are gradually learning more about these biochemical interactions, the details still remain largely unclear. Studies, both computational and experimental, have shown that the strength of the rhythmic interaction critically decides if a system can synchronize, i.e., the interactions must be strong enough. In this work, we show that the rhythmic interaction between these neuronal clocks must be timed correctly (in the right phase) in addition to being strong enough to synchronize the network. Activating (repressing) interactions must coincide with other activators (repressors) in each neuron to achieve synchrony. Since this principle imposes certain properties on synchronizing interactions, these properties can be used to identify and understand novel interaction mechanisms. Further, these principles are applicable to interactions between cellular oscillators in other tissues and organisms.
