Meiosis is the type of cell division used by sexually reproducing organisms to create gametes (eggs and sperm, in animals). During meiosis, the two copies of each chromosome swap segments of DNA, forming reciprocal exchanges called crossovers. Crossovers are needed to help ensure that each gamete inherits a copy of every chromosome. Exchange occurs at deliberately induced double-strand DNA breaks, a subset of which become crossovers. In this study we investigate the role of the Tel1/ATM checkpoint kinase in modulating meiotic recombination in budding yeast. We find that in the absence of Tel1, recombination is increased, crossover distribution is altered, and crossovers are less dependent on the Zip3 protein, which mediates the major crossover pathway in yeast. We also find evidence which we infer indicates that Tel1, the helicase Sgs1, and the crossover-promoting proteins Zip3 and Msh4 influence how breaks are positioned throughout the genome. These results are consistent with a role for Tel1 in regulating the spacing of breaks along chromosomes. Our results also suggest that crossover-committed sites may suppress break formation in surrounding areas. Such a feedback mechanism would allow cells to achieve a sufficient number of crossovers without sustaining excess DNA breaks, which are inherently risky.
