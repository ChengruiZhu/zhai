Patients treated with CECC had a significantly higher mean logistic EuroSCORE (6.3% vs. 5.0%; p < 0.001), a slightly lower rate of preoperative myocardial infarction (46% vs. 51%; p = 0.01) and a higher rate of impaired renal function (eGFR < 60 mL/min/1.73 m2: 24% vs. 20%; p = 0.01) compared to MECC-patients. Left internal mammary artery was significantly used more often in MECC patients (93% vs. 86%; p < 0.001). Cardiopulmonary bypass and aortic-cross clamping time were significantly lower in the MECC group (p < 0.001). Overall 30-day mortality was significantly higher in patients treated with CECC (4.4% vs. 2.2%; p = 0.002). Within the different age groups mortality rates were not significantly different except for patients aged 60–69 years (4.5% vs. 1.8%; p = 0.03). Postoperative requirement of renal replacement therapy (4% vs. 2.2%; p = 0.01), respiratory insufficiency (9.9% vs. 6.6%; P = 0.004) and incidence of low cardiac output syndrome (3% vs. 1.2%; p = 0.003) were significantly increased in patients with CECC. Multivariate analysis identified age (p = 0.005; 95% CI 1.01 to 1.08; OR 1.05) among other parameters as an independent risk factor, whereas conventional extracorporeal circulation itself did not present as an independent risk factor for 30-day mortality.
