Learning by following advice is fundamental for human cultural evolution. Yet it is largely unknown how the brain implements advice-taking in order to maximize rewards. Here, we used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and behavioral experiments to study how people use one-off advice. We find that advice had a sustained effect on choices and modulated learning in two ways. First, participants initially assumed that the recommended option was most beneficial. Second, and more importantly, gains and losses obtained after following advice received an “outcome-bonus,” in which they were evaluated more positively than after not following advice. In other words, following advice was in general intrinsically rewarding. Computer simulations showed that the outcome-bonus is adaptive, because it benefits from good advice and limits the effect of bad advice. The fMRI analysis revealed a neural outcome-bonus signal in the septal area and left caudate head, structures previously implicated in trust and reward based learning. Participants with greater outcome-bonuses showed a greater gain-signal increase after following advice in the amygdala, a structure implicated in processing emotions and social information. In sum, these results suggest that decision makers adaptively combine advice and individual learning with a social learning mechanism in which advice modulates the neural reward response.
