β-guanidinopropionic acid (β-GPA) has been used as a nutritional supplement for increasing physical strength and endurance with positive and predictable results. In muscles, it works as a nonadaptive stimulator of mitochondria biogenesis; it also increases lipid metabolism. There are data indicating that β-GPA can be also neuroprotective, but its mechanisms of action in the brain are less understood. We studied the effects of β-GPA on animal behavior and mitochondrial biogenesis in the cortex and midbrain of mid-age healthy mice. We found that even short-term 3-week-long β-GPA treatment increased the mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) copy number in the cortex and ventral midbrain, as well as the expression of several key antioxidant and metabolic enzymes—indicators of mitochondria proliferation and the activation of Nrf2/ARE signaling cascade. At the same time, β-GPA downregulated the expression of the β-oxidation genes. Administration of β-GPA in mice for 3 weeks improved the animals’ physical strength and endurance health, ie, increased their physical strength and endurance and alleviated anxiety. Thus, β-GPA might be considered an adaptogene affecting both the muscle and brain metabolism in mammals.
