Synapses, which are small structures where information is transmitted between neurons, are the functional units of computation in the brain implicated in information processing, learning and memory. In the last few years several genes that are expressed in synapses have been linked to brain disorders such as autism, depression and schizophrenia. However, good understanding of the molecular basis of these diseases requires more insight in the functional organization of the protein network. In the classic view proteins are involved in a specific step of a cellular process, whereas modern system theories suggest a more integrated and complex network where proteins can be involved in several steps. We have developed a method that allows comparison of high-end but low-throughput functional data from different genetic perturbation studies despite the poor standardization between studies. Our analysis shows that synaptic proteins are not restricted to a single function but that they are part of a highly integrated supramolecular machine, with overlapping protein sets being involved in distinct steps in neurotransmitter release. Further characterization of these complex protein network relations will be important for new drug design strategies.
