Stroke, a devastating complication of sickle cell anemia (SCA), can cause irreversible brain injury with physical and cognitive deficits. Transcranial Doppler ultrasonography (TCD) is a non-invasive tool for identifying children with SCA at highest risk of stroke. National guidelines recommend that TCD screening begin at age 2 years, yet there is research to suggest less than half of young children undergo screening. The purpose of this project was to use quality improvement methods to improve the proportion of patients aged 24–27 months who successfully completed their initial TCD from 25% to 75% by December 31, 2013. Quality improvement methods (e.g., process mapping, simplified failure mode effect analysis, and plan–do–study–act cycles) were used to develop and test processes for identifying eligible patients, scheduling TCDs, preparing children and families for the first TCD, and monitoring outcomes (i.e., TCD protocol). Progress was tracked using a report of eligible patients and a chart showing the age in months for the first successful TCD (population metric). As of December 2013, 100% of eligible patients successfully completed their initial TCD screen; this improvement was maintained for the next 20 months. In November 2014, a Welch’s one-way ANOVA was conducted. Results showed a statistically significant difference between the average age of first TCD for eligible patients born in 2009 and eligible patients born during the intervention period (2010–2013;
