Plasticity in the adult neocortex is the basis of our learning and memory. However, its molecular mechanisms are still unclear. In the sensory barrel cortex of rodents, a well-characterized model for neocortical plasticity, neurons directly code for whisker displacement—neurons within a given barrel will fire when the whisker that that barrel represents is moved. Strikingly, the deprivation of all but a single whisker alters the original representations—cortical columns representing the deprived inputs shrink and that representing the spared inputs expands, intruding into the surrounding deprived columns. Because single-neuron-level structural changes are suggested to be involved in this plasticity, here we focused on cofilin1, a protein that is known to modulate the cytoskeleton and to regulate the structure of dendritic spines. We induced experience-dependent plasticity in the D1 column by sparing only the D1 whisker, and knocked down the expression of cofilin1 in the D2 column. Cofilin1 knockdown differentially affected plasticity, such that experience-dependent increases in spared input representation were impaired, whereas decreases in deprived input representation were intact. We then found that during these plastic changes, the density of dendritic spines increased in a cofilin1-dependent manner around the connections between the D1 and D2 columns. Cofilin1-dependent density increase was observed only in the most superficial part of the cortex but not in deeper parts, consistent with the distribution patterns of axons that transmit spared and deprived information, respectively. These results suggest that cofilin1 regulates neocortical functional plasticity through the remodeling of dendritic spines within circuits that connect columns.
