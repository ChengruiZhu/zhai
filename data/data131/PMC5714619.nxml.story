The safe and accurate delivery of radiotherapy requires that the various items of equipment used in the treatment process are in proper working order. Unusual equipment behavior, interlocks, and faults need to be communicated promptly to the appropriate personnel, the issue investigated, and information regarding the nature of faults and any subsequent reparative measures recorded in a readily accessible location. At the Illawarra Cancer Care Centre, an online help desk was introduced for the purposes of reporting and tracking equipment faults. In the three years since its introduction, there have been in excess of 1,300 entries made, and it has proven to be a suitable alternative to the use of a physical logbook. Key benefits identified were improved accessibility, automated fault notification, and the ability to search, review and update entries for particular equipment faults. It has been a useful tool for assessing the long‚Äêterm performance of each piece of equipment, identifying specific servicing needs, and for substantiating the effectiveness of the service performed. The online help desk has not replaced the need for direct methods of verbal communication between the various professional groups involved with monitoring equipment performance. However, it is a very useful tool for supporting that communication.
