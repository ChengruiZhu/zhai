Huntington's disease (HD) is a neurodegenerative disorder for which the mutation results in an extra-long tract of glutamines that causes the huntingtin protein to aggregate. It is characterized by neurological symptoms and brain pathology that is associated with nuclear and cytoplasmic aggregates and with transcriptional dysregulation. Despite the fact that HD has been recognized principally as a neurological disease, there are multiple epidemiological studies showing that HD patients exhibit a high rate of cardiovascular events leading to heart failure. To unravel the cause of cardiac dysfunction in HD models, we employed a wide range of molecular and physiological methods using two well established genetic mouse models of this disease. We found that pre-symptomatic animals developed aberrant gap junction channel expression and a significant deregulation of hypertrophic markers that may predispose them to arrhythmia and an overall change in cardiac function. These changes were accompanied by the re-expression of foetal genes, apoptotic cardiomyocyte loss and a moderate degree of interstitial fibrosis in the symptomatic animals. Surprisingly, we could identify neither mutant HTT aggregates in cardiac tissue nor a HD-specific transcriptional dysregulation. Therefore, we conclude that the HD-related cardiomyopathy could be driven by altered central autonomic pathways.
