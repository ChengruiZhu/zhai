 regulatory transmembrane protein calnexin to the MAM. Another function of the MAM is the regulation of mitochondrial dynamics mediated by GTPases such as dynamin-related protein 1 (Drp1). Consistent with the importance of the MAM for mitochondrial dynamics and the role of Rab32 in MAM enrichment, the inactivation of Rab32 leads to mitochondrial collapse around the nucleus. However, Rab32 and related Rabs also perform intracellular functions at locations other than the MAM including melanosomal trafficking, autophagosome formation and maturation, and retrograde trafficking to the trans-Golgi network (TGN). This plethora of functions raises questions concerning the original cellular role of Rab32 in the last common ancestor of animals and its possible role in the last eukaryotic common ancestor (LECA). Our results now shed light on this conundrum and identify a role in Drp1-mediated mitochondrial dynamics as one common denominator of this group of Rabs, which includes the paralogues Rab32A and Rab32B, as well as the more recently derived Rab29 and Rab38 proteins. Moreover, we provide evidence that this mitochondrial function is dictated by the extent of ER-association of Rab32 family proteins.
