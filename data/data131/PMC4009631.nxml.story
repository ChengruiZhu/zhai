Newer developments in the field of chemotherapeutic drug regimes, radiotherapy, and surgical techniques have improved the prognosis of cancer patients tremendously. Today increasing numbers of patients with aggressive disease are posted for surgical resection. The advances in reconstructive flap surgery offer the patient a near normal dignified postresection life. Hence, the expectations from the patients are also on the rise. Anesthetic challenges known in oncosurgery are that of difficult airway, maintenance of hemodynamics and temperature during long surgical hours, pain management, and postoperative intensive care management. But, recently acquired data raised the possibility of the anesthetic technique and conduct of perioperative period as a possible contributory factor in the growth and possible recurrence of the primary tumor. The foundation of the concept is somewhat fragile and not supported by conclusive evidence. In fact, like any other controversial topic in medicine, contradictory reports of the favorable effects of anesthetic technique and medications are plenty in the literature. This is the basis of our article where we have analyzed the current evidence available in the literature and how these and the forthcoming large scale studies may revolutionize the practice of oncoanesthesia.
