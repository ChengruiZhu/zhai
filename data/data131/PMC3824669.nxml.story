Arginase, an arginine-degrading enzyme, has gained increased attention recently as a new experimental therapeutics for a variety of malignant solid cancers. In this study, we found that recombinant human arginase (rhArg) could induce remarkable growth inhibition, cell cycle arrest, and caspase-dependent apoptosis in Raji and Daudi non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) cells through arginine deprivation. Interestingly, rhArg-treatment resulted in the appearance of autophagosomes and upregulation of microtubule-associated protein light chain 3 II, indicating that rhArg induced autophagy in lymphoma cells. Further study suggested that mammalian target of rapamycin/S6k signaling pathway may be involved in rhArg-induced autophagy in NHL cells. Moreover, blocking autophagy using pharmacological inhibitors (3-methyladenine and chloroquine) or genetic approaches (small interfering RNA targeting autophagy-related gene 5 and Beclin-1) enhanced the cell killing effect of rhArg. These results demonstrated that rhArg has a potent anti-lymphoma activity, which could be improved by in combination with autophagic inhibitors, suggesting that rhArg, either alone or in combination with autophagic inhibitors, could be a potential novel therapeutics for the treatment of NHL.
