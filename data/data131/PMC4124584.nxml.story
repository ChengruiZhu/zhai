Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT) is a disease characterized by mucocutaneous telangiectasias and visceral arteriovenous malformations. The genetic mutations that cause this disease result in elevated levels of vascular endothelial growth factor, which is inhibited by bevacizumab. Previous studies have shown bevacizumab treatment to be effective in reducing symptoms, but study protocols have all used oncological dosing parameters, which carry several well-described serious side effects. This study investigates whether drastically lower dosages of bevacizumab than normally used in oncological treatment could control epistaxis in patients with HHT and medically refractory epistaxis. A prospective, open-label, noncomparative study enrolled six patients receiving 0.125-mg/kg infusions of bevacizumab once every 4 weeks for a total of six infusions. Severity of epistaxis was assessed with the epistaxis severity score, and quality-of-life measures were followed with the 20-item Sino-Nasal Outcome Test and 36-item Short Form surveys. A statistically significant improvement was seen in the control of epistaxis severity and frequency, with minimal negative side effects and high patient satisfaction. Very low dose bevacizumab treatment is an effective method of controlling medically refractory epistaxis in patients with HHT and additional investigation to optimize dosing guidelines is warranted.
