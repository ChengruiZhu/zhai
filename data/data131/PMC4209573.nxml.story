The study was performed on 520 colon cancer patients with age range of 23-88 years. The mean age of the patients was 63 (S.D.=11.8) and the median age was 64. Two hundred thirty seven (45.4%) patients were female and 283 (54.4%) were male. Using Chi-square test, age<60 (p=0.002) and female gender (p=0.034) had a significant correlation with complete treatment and there was a significant relationship between complete follow up and age<60 (p=0.037), academic education (p=0.02) and having insurance (p=0.021). Multiple logistic regression tests were used to evaluate concurrent effects of variables on treatment and follow up. Correlated variables to complete treatment include: age<60 (p=0.001), and female gender The Odds Ratio (OR) of completing treatment for patients under 60 years of age versus patients above 60 years was 3.13 (95% C.I. 1.55 to 6.34), and the OR of completing treatment for women versus men was 1.91(95% C.I. 1.33 to 2.74). Correlated variables to follow up were academic education ( ) and having insurance . The OR of cancer follow up in illiterate patients versus college-educated patients was 0.45 (95% C.I. 0.24 to 0.82), and the OR of cancer follow up in patients without insurance versus patients with health was 0.46 (95% C.I. 0.21 to 0.98).
