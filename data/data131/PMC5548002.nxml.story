Saponins, which are glycosylated, represent a diverse group of biologically functional products in plants. In the present study, we investigated the effects of soyasaponin Ag, a secondary metabolite extracted from soybean, on α-melanocyte-stimulating hormone (α-MSH)-induced melanin synthesis in B16F10 mouse melanoma cells and the underlying molecular mechanisms. To elucidate the mechanisms through which soyasaponin Ag inhibits melanin synthesis, we performed cellular tyrosinase activity assays and analyzed the expression of the melanogenesis-related genes, tyrosinase, tyrosinase-related protein (TRP)-1 and TRP-2. We demonstrated that soyasaponin Ag inhibited α-MSH-induced melanin synthesis in melanoma cells. Of note, soyasaponin Ag had no inhibitory effect on intracellular tyrosinase activity. However, soyasaponin Ag inhibited TRP-2 expression in a dose-dependent manner. Therefore, the depigmenting effect of soyasaponin Ag may be due to the inhibition of tyrosinase expression or the enhancement of tyrosinase degradation. Moreover, soyasaponin Ag did not exert any toxic on B16F10 mouse melanoma cells, suggesting that soyasaponin is a safe component for use in skin care cosmetic formulations that are used for skin whitening.
