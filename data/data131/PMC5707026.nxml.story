. Specific small interfering RNAs and expression plasmids encoding wild type Botch and Botch with Glu115Ala mutation were exploited. The protein levels of Botch and Notch1 transmembrane intracellular domain (Notch1-TMIC) were increased within brain tissue around hematoma. Botch overexpression led to an increase in unprocessed Notch1 full-length form accompanied by a significant decrease in Notch1-TMIC, while Botch knockdown resulted in an approximately 1.5-fold increase in Notch1-TMIC. There were increased cell apoptosis, necrosis and neurobehavioral deficits after ICH, which was inhibited by Botch overexpression and enhanced by Botch knockdown. Double immunofluorescence showed a colocalization of Botch and Notch1 in the trans-Golgi. Overexpression of wild type Botch, but not Botch E115A mutant, led to an increase in the interaction between Botch and Notch1, reduced the formation and the nuclear localization of Notch1 intracellular domain, and attenuated cell apoptosis and inflammation. In conclusion, Botch exerts neuroprotection against neuronal damage via antagonizing the maturation of Notch1 in Glu115-denpendent manner. However, neuroprotection mediated by endogenous Botch is not enough to reverse ICH-induced secondary brain injury.
