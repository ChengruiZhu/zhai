Fifty-three patients were available for follow-up at an average of 3.2 years (range: 1.0-6.5 years). Twenty underwent biceps tenodesis and 33 underwent repair. Pre-operatively, there were no significant differences in mean ASES, DASH-sport, and VAS between biceps tenodesis and repair groups. Both groups had significant postoperative improvement in all PROs, and the average amount of change from preoperative to postoperative scores between the two groups was not significantly different for any of the PRO scores. Post-operatively, there were no significant differences in mean ASES, DASH-sport, VAS, and satisfaction between biceps tenodesis and repair groups (ASES: biceps tenodesis 87.1 vs. repair 86.9, P=0.97; DASH-sport: 17.0 vs. 19.5, P=0.75; VAS: 1.8 vs. 1.6, P=0.73; Satisfaction: 8.6 vs. 8.2, P=0.45). Rate of return to pre-injury level of play in sport/physical activity was also similar between groups (biceps tenodesis 55% vs. repair 50%, P=0.73). In the repair group, there was one minor complication involving a superficial paresthesia, and one other patient required reoperation (capsular release) after two years for persistent difficulty throwing in softball. There were no complications or reoperations in the biceps tenodesis group.
