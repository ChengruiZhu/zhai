Smoking frequently leads to epigenetic alterations, including DNA methylation and histone modifications. The effect that smoking has on the DNA methylation levels at CCGG sites, the expression of trimethylation of histone H3 at lysine 27 (H3K27me3) and enhancer of zeste homolog 2 (EZH2), and their interactions in patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) were analyzed. There were a total of 42 patients with NSCLC, 22 with adenocarcinomas and 20 with squamous cell carcinomas enrolled in the present study. Expression of H3K27me3, EZH2 and proliferating cellular nuclear antigen (PCNA) were immunohistochemically detected. DNA methylation at CCGG sites was evaluated via histoendonuclease-linked detection of DNA methylation sites. The apoptotic index of cancerous tissues obtained from patients of different smoking statuses was evaluated via the terminal deoxynucleotidyl-transferase-mediated dUTP-biotin nick end labeling method. The association with clinicopathological data was calculated relative to different smoking statuses. Compared with the non-smokers, smokers with NSCLC exhibited a significantly lower apoptotic index (P<0.05), and frequently had a lower level of DNA methylation at CCGG sites, lower H3K27me3 expression and a higher EZH2 expression (P<0.05). DNA methylation levels at CCGG sites were negatively correlated to the Brinkman index (P=0.017). Furthermore, there was a parallel association between the H3K27me3 and EZH2 expression levels in the majority of smokers, whereas in the majority of non-smokers, there was a diverging association (P=0.015). There was a diverging association between the PCNA and EZH2 expression levels in the majority of smokers; however, in the majority of non-smokers, there was a parallel association (P=0.048). In addition, the association between the CCGG methylation ratio and immunohistochemical expression of H3K27me3 was a parallel association in the majority of smokers, while in the majority of non-smokers there was a diverging association (P=0.049). Conclusively, patients with NSCLC and different smoking statuses exhibit different epigenetic characteristics. Additionally, DNA methylation levels at the CCGG sites may have the ability to determine associations between the expression levels of H3K27me3, EZH2 and PCNA.
