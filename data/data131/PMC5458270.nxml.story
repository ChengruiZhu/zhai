The formation of bovine skeletal muscle involves complex developmental and physiological processes that play a vital role in determining the quality of beef; however, the regulatory mechanisms underlying differences in meat quality are largely unknown. We conducted transcriptome analysis of bovine muscle tissues to compare gene expression profiles between embryonic and adult stages. Total RNAs from skeletal muscle of Qinchuan cattle at fetal and adult stages were used to construct libraries for Illumina next-generation sequencing using the Ribo-Zero RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) method. We found a total of 19,695 genes to be expressed in fetal and adult stages, whereby 3,299 were expressed only in fetal, and 433 only in adult tissues. We characterized the role of a candidate gene (GosB), which was highly (but differentially) expressed in embryonic and adult skeletal muscle tissue. GosB increased the number of myoblasts in the S-phase of the cell cycle, and decreased the proportion of cells in the G0/G1 phase. GosB promoted the proliferation of myoblasts and protected them from apoptosis via regulating Bcl-2 expression and controlling the intracellular calcium concentration. Modulation of GosB expression in muscle tissue may emerge as a potential target in breeding strategies attempting to alter myoblast numbers in cattle.
