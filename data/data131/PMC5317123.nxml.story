The treatment of supraglottic carcinoma remains a controversial issue. Five accepted surgical and non-surgical oncological treatments have been currently established: standard horizontal supraglottic laryngectomy (HSL), supraglottic CO2 laser microsurgery (TLM), transoral robotic surgery, radiotherapy alone and radiotherapy in combination with chemotherapy. Some studies have shown that complications of head and neck surgeries increase significantly in patients over 65 years compared to younger patients. We designed a retrospective analysis to assess the rate of complications and functional outcomes of patients treated by TLM and HSL in cases of T1-T3 supraglottic squamous cell carcinomas (SCC) in a tertiary University Hospital. Results were compared between patients younger and older than 65 years. We found significant differences in the rate of aspiration pneumonia (p = 0.026), mean time to decannulation (p = 0.001) and mean hospital stay (p = 0.007) in patients treated by TLM, which was higher and longer in the group of patients over 65 years of age. Regarding HPL, we only found significant differences in the mean time to decannulation (p = 0.001), which was longer in the group of patients younger than 65 years. According to our results, TLM or HPL can both be a safe surgical option for patients older than 65 years, but previous evaluation of lung function before surgery is mandatory because of an increased risk of aspiration pneumonia in patients with lung problems, especially when treated by TLM. Concerning functional outcomes in patients older than 65 years, TLM reduces the postoperative rate of tracheostomy, mean time required for decannulation and mean hospital stay compared with HPL. However, no significant difference in the occurrence of aspiration pneumonia, dysphagia or in the mean length of NGT feeding was found.
