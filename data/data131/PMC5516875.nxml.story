miRNAs have emerged as new biomarkers for the detection of a wide variety of cancers. By employing duplex-specific nuclease for signal amplification and gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) as the carriers of detection probes, a novel electrochemical assay of miRNAs was performed. The method is based on conversion of the well-known colorimetric assay into electrochemical analysis with enhanced sensitivity. DNA capture probes immobilized on the electrode surface and ferrocene (Fc)-labeled DNA detection probes (denoted “Fc-DNA-Fc”) presented in the solution induced the assembly of positively charged AuNPs on the electrode surface through the electrostatic interaction. As a result, a large number of Fc-DNA-Fc molecules were attached on the electrode surface, thus amplifying the electrochemical signal. When duplex-specific nuclease was added to recycle the process of miRNA-initiated digestion of the immobilized DNA probes, Fc-DNA-Fc-induced assembly of AuNPs on the electrode surface could not occur. This resulted in a significant fall in the oxidation current of Fc. The current was found to be inversely proportional to the concentration of miRNAs in the range of 0–25 fM, and a detection limit of 0.1 fM was achieved. Moreover, this work presents a new method for converting colorimetric assays into sensitive electrochemical analyses, and thus would be valuable for design of novel chemical/biosensors.
