For more than a quarter century, we have known that STAT1 and STAT2 are essential for the classic host immune defense system against viral infections known as the type 1 interferon response. While STAT1 has since been assigned multiple additional roles, STAT2 is thought to function exclusively as the principal partner of STAT1 in the type 1 interferon system. However, patients and animals that are deficient in STAT2 show a surprisingly varied and sometimes subtle phenotype not fully accounted for by the known functions of this protein. Our investigations reveal an entirely novel facet of STAT2 action, namely as an innate inhibitor of STAT1 in its multiple biological roles. We identify the molecular mechanism of STAT1 inhibition and generate a novel biological tool with which we can dissociate STAT2â€™s activating and inhibitory effects on STAT1. We use this tool to show that STAT2 has major roles beyond antiviral protection, for example, in regulating cell proliferation and immune cell functions, as well as in killing intracellular parasites. These findings considerably expand our knowledge of STAT2 biology and necessitate a reassessment of regulatory mechanisms central to innate immunity and the therapeutic use of interferons.
