Numerous substrates are tyrosine phosphorylated upon CD2 stimulation of human Jurkat T cells using a mitogenic pair of CD2 monoclonal antibodies, including the phospholipase C (PLC)gamma-1-p35/36 complex. Most of these substrates are identically tyrosine phosphorylated after CD3 ligation, suggesting that both stimuli share the same biochemical pathway. We show, however, in this report that a 63-kD protein is specifically phosphorylated on tyrosine residues after ligation of the CD2 molecule. The tyrosine phosphorylation of p63 can be induced independently of other substrates when using a single CD2 mAb recognizing the D66 epitope of the molecule. Importantly, this CD2- induced tyrosine phosphorylation of p63 can also occur in the absence of the CD3 zeta chain membrane expression, and is also distinct from the protein tyrosine kinases p56lck and p59fyn. We demonstrate, moreover, that p63 is physically linked with PLC gamma-1 and p35/36 upon CD2 stimulation. Finally, we also show that a 62-kD protein coimmunoprecipitating with the p21ras GTPase activating protein (GAP) is heavily tyrosine phosphorylated only after CD2 stimulation. This ultimately suggests that p63 may represent in fact the 62-kD protein that associates with GAP after tyrosine phosphorylation. Taken together, these results demonstrate the occurrence in Jurkat cells of a tyrosine kinase pathway specifically coupled to the CD2 molecule. They also suggest a function of the p62-GAP-associated protein as a link between PLC gamma-1 and p21ras activation pathways after CD2 activation.
