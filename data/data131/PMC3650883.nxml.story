This paper investigates the relationship between the concept of activity (including both
professional and nonprofessional) and cognitive functioning among older European individuals. In
this research, we used data collected during the first wave of SHARE (Survey on Health, Ageing and
Retirement in Europe), and a measurement approach known as stochastic frontier analysis, derived
from the economic literature. SHARE includes a large population (n > 25,000) geographically
distributed across Europe, and analyzes several dimensions simultaneously, including physical and
mental health activity. The main advantages of stochastic frontier analysis are that it allows
estimation of parametric function relating cognitive scores and driving factors at the boundary and
disentangles frontier noise and distance to frontier components, as well as testing the effect of
potential factors on these distances simultaneously. The analysis reveals that all activities are
positively related to cognitive functioning in elderly people. Our results are discussed in terms of
prevention of cognitive aging and Alzheimerâ€™s disease, and regarding the potential impact
that some retirement programs might have on cognitive functioning in individuals across Europe.
