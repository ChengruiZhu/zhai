Caveolae-mediated endocytosis is a highly regulated endocytic pathway that exists in parallel to other forms of clathrin-dependent and -independent endocytosis. Internalized caveolae accumulate in intermediate organelles called caveosomes. Here we addressed the further fate of internalized caveolae by inducing caveolae-mediated uptake of albumin by HepG2 cells. We followed the route of internalized caveolin-1 by immunogold labelling of ultrathin frozen sections and by Western blot analyses of purified membrane fractions. Long-term (1 and 3 hrs) albumin treatment resulted in the appearance of albumin-containing caveolae in special multi-caveolar complexes (consisting of multiple caveolae clustered together) connected to the plasma membrane and caveosome-like structures in the cytoplasm. In addition, numerous CD63 (LIMP-1) positive late endosomes/multi-vesicular bodies were found positive for caveolin-1, suggesting that upon albumin incubation, caveolin-1 is endocytosed and enters the degradative pathway. Surprisingly, the number of caveolae at the plasma membrane increased after addition of albumin. This increase was blocked by cycloheximide treatment, indicating that albumin internalization also stimulates
