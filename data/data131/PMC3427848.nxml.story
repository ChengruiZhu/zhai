In the past few decades, a number of studies have reported that accessory foramina are located on the internal aspect of the mandible, indicating their potential importance for effective and successful clinical procedures. The aim of this study is to evaluate adult, infantile, and fetal human mandibles for occurrence of accessory foramina. To our knowledge, this is the first time that an attempt has been made to examine their particular co-location using a systematic approach and perspective. A total of 397 human mandibles, including 299 adult, 18 infantile, and 80 fetal, were investigated macroscopically for the frequency, position, and diameter of accessory foramina. In 96Â % of investigated adult mandibles, at least one accessory foramen was found. Foramina were located either superior or inferior to the genial tubercle, as well as lateral to the tubercle. Bearing in mind their usual location, four different types of coexistence of foramina were distinguished. Accessory foramina were also present in similar locations in infantile and fetal mandibles. Accessory mandibular foramina are constant structures of human mandible. Their frequency, size, and location vary depending on the type of the foramen. Observations on children and fetal mandibles showed no significant differences in evaluation of accessory foramina, with the exception of lower occurrence in this group of subjects.
