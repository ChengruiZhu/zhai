The need to optimize the use of all the information that modern technological tools have made available to the physician ENT/audiologist has increasingly emerged within the Italian scientific community. Towards this purpose, it is necessary to create a registry of the patients using cochlear implants (CIs). This registry will include a homogeneous summary of the information deriving from multiple sources related to daily clinical practice, in order to assess auditory benefits, safety and reliability in patients with cochlear implants, and organization over the national territory. The primary objectives relative to the above-mentioned analysis are to assess the impact of the use of cochlear implants on patient health, to ensure traceability of the devices currently used, monitoring their safety and reliability over time, to guarantee access of the technique in clinical and organizational conditions that can allow the best possible benefits. The aspects concerning implementation of the registry were discussed extensively during the first meetings of the Working Group (WG). In particular, owing to the complexity and high costs related mainly to the development of the technological aspects and the need to involve technological partners external to the WG, and to respect current privacy laws, the WG members decided that the project should be limited to proposal of a paper registry to be implemented at a later stage, possibly within the framework of successive research projects. During meetings, the WG members discussed various aspects of implementation of the registry, and in particular the scientific features connected to objectives, inclusion criteria, and structure of the forms needed for data collection and organizational aspects. A registry is proposed herein.
