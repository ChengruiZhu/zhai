 using measured records of morphological traits. The results showed that surveyed traits and standard deviation were 1,355±742 g of body weight, 48.01±7.79 cm of total length, and 40.96±6.80 cm of body length. Also body height, body shape index and condition factor were 17.19±3.43 cm, 9.99±0.74 and 11.16±1.54, respectively. As result of least squares mean and standard error for each trait assumed in this study, those of farmed population showed significantly higher than those of wild population in all traits, exclusively in total length and body length (p<0.01). Particularly, the values of the body height and the body weight of the farmed population were higher than those of the wild population in the same total length. And the phenotypic correlation coefficients of the body weight, the total length, the body length and the body height showed strong positive correlation in all populations. These result suggested that morphological differences exist in farmed and wild flounder. Therefore, introduction of wild flounder is essential for the future production to improve the body type of farmed flounder, and parental fish should be chosen by considering selection of commercially important traits in the production process.
