Crowding is related to an integration of feature signals over an inappropriately large area in the visual periphery. The rules of this integration are still not well understood. This study attempts to understand how the orientation signals from the target and flankers are combined. A target Gabor, together with 2, 4, or 6 flanking Gabors, was briefly presented in a peripheral location (4° eccentricity). The observer's task was to identify the orientation of the target (eight-alternative forced-choice). Performance was found to be nonmonotonically dependent on the target–flanker orientation difference (a drop at intermediate differences). For small target–flanker differences, a strong assimilation bias was observed. An effect of the number of flankers was found for heterogeneous flankers only. It appears that different rules of integration are used, dependent on some salient aspects (target pop-out, homogeneity–heterogeneity) of the stimulus pattern. The strategy of combining simple rules may be explained by the goal of the visual system to encode potentially important aspects of a stimulus with limited processing resources and using statistical regularities of the natural visual environment.
