Excess nitric oxide (NO) induces apoptosis of some cell types, including macrophages. As NO is synthesized by NO synthase (NOS) from arginine, a common substrate of arginase, these two enzymes compete for arginine. There are two known isoforms of arginase, types I and II. Using murine macrophage-like RAW 264.7 cells, we asked if the induction of arginase II would downregulate NO production and hence prevent apoptosis. When cells were exposed to lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and interferon-γ (IFN-γ), the inducible form of NOS (iNOS) was induced, production of NO was elevated, and apoptosis followed. When dexamethasone and cAMP were further added, both iNOS and arginase II were induced, NO production was much decreased, and apoptosis was prevented. When the cells were transfected with an arginase II expression plasmid and treated with LPS/IFN-γ, some cells were rescued from apoptosis. An arginase I expression plasmid was also effective. On the other hand, transfection with the arginase II plasmid did not prevent apoptosis when a NO donor SNAP or a high concentration (12 mM) of arginine was added. These results indicate that arginase II prevents NO-dependent apoptosis of RAW 264.7 cells by depleting intracellular arginine and by decreasing NO production.
