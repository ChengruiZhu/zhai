When melan-a melanocytes were treated with UV-B-irradiated SP-1 keratinocytes media, cell proliferation increased. This increased proliferation of melanocytes decreased with a neutralizing anti-bFGF antibody. To elucidate the effects of ginsenosides on melanocyte proliferation induced by bFGF, we tested 15 types of ginsenoside compounds. Among them, Rh3, Rh1, F1, and CK demonstrated antiproliferative effects on bFGF-induced melanocyte proliferation after 72Â h of treatment. bFGF stimulated cell proliferation via extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) activation in various cell types. Western blot analysis found bFGF-induced ERK phosphorylation in melan-a. Treatment with Rh3 inhibited bFGF-induced maximum ERK phosphorylation and F1-delayed maximum ERK phosphorylation, whereas Rh1 and CK had no detectable effects. In addition, cotreatment with Rh3 and F1 significantly suppressed bFGF-induced ERK phosphorylation. Western blot analysis found that bFGF increased microphthalmia-associated transcription factor (MITF) protein levels in melan-a. Treatment with Rh3 or F1 had no detectable effects, whereas cotreatment with Rh3 and F1 inhibited bFGF-induced MITF expression levels more strongly than a single treatment.
