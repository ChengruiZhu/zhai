The PI3K/Akt/mTOR signalling network is activated in almost 90% of all glioblastoma, the most common primary brain tumour, which is almost invariably lethal within 15 months of diagnosis. Despite intensive research, modulation of this signalling cascade has so far yielded little therapeutic benefit, suggesting that the role of the PI3K network as a pro-survival factor in glioblastoma and therefore a potential target in combination therapy should be re-evaluated. Therefore, we used two distinct pharmacological inhibitors that block signalling at different points of the cascade, namely, GDC-0941 (Pictilisib), a direct inhibitor of the near apical PI3K, and Rapamycin which blocks the side arm of the network that is regulated by mTOR complex 1. While both substances, at concentrations where they inhibit their primary target, have similar effects on proliferation and sensitisation for temozolomide-induced apoptosis, GDC-0941 appears to have a stronger effect on cellular motility than Rapamycin. In vivo GDC-0941 effectively retards growth of orthotopic transplanted human tumours in murine brains and significantly prolongs mouse survival. However, when looking at genetically identical cell populations that are in alternative states of differentiation, i.e. stem cell-like cells and their differentiated progeny, a more complex picture regarding the PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway emerges. The pathway is differently regulated in the alternative cell populations and, while it contributes to the increased chemo-resistance of stem cell-like cells compared to differentiated cells, it only contributes to the motility of the latter. Our findings are the first to suggest that within a glioblastoma tumour the PI3K network can have distinct, cell-specific functions. These have to be carefully considered when incorporating inhibition of PI3K-mediated signals into complex combination therapies.
