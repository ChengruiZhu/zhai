In many age-dependent neurodegenerative diseases, the accumulation of misfolded or mutant proteins drives pathogenesis. Several protein quality control pathways have emerged as central regulators of the turnover of these toxic proteins and therefore impact phenotypic severity. In spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy (SBMA), the mutant androgen receptor with an expanded glutamine tract undergoes hormone-dependent nuclear translocation, unfolding, and oligomerizationâ€”steps that are critical to the development of progressive proximal limb and bulbar muscle weakness in men. Here we show that the unfolded protein response (UPR), an endoplasmic reticulum stress response, is triggered in skeletal muscle from SBMA patients and knock-in mice. We find that disruption of the UPR exacerbates skeletal muscle atrophy through the induction of macroautophagy, a lysosomal protein quality pathway. In contrast, impaired autophagy diminishes muscle wasting and prolongs lifespan of SBMA mice. Our findings highlight cross-talk between the UPR and autophagy, and they suggest that limited activation of the autophagic pathway may be beneficial in certain neuromuscular diseases such as SBMA where the nucleus is the essential site of toxicity.
