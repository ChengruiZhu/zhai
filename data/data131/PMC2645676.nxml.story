What mathematicians call the “labeling problem” underlies difficulties in interpreting many classes of complex biological data. To derive valid inferences from multiple, noisy datasets, one must consider all possible combinations of the data to find the solution that best matches the experimental evidence. Exhaustive searches totally outstrip current computer resources, and, as a result, it has been necessary to resort to approximations such as branch and bound or Monte Carlo simulations, which have the disadvantages of being limited to use in separate steps of the analysis and not providing the final results in a probabilistic fashion that allows the quality of the answers to be evaluated. The Probabilistic Interaction Network of Evidence (PINE) algorithm that we present here offers a general solution to this problem. We have demonstrated the usefulness of the PINE approach by applying it to one of the major bottlenecks in NMR spectroscopy. The PINE-NMR server takes as input the sequence of a protein and the peak lists from one or more multidimensional NMR experiments and provides as output a probabilistic assignment of the NMR signals to specific atoms in the protein's covalent structure and a self-consistent probabilistic analysis of the protein's secondary structure.
