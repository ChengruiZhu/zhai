Unlike conventional pathogens, prions are infectious particles devoid of nucleic acids and composed entirely of a misfolded host protein, PrP. It is widely assumed that the neurodegeneration observed in prion disorders may be related to an aberrant function of PrP in the misfolded state. However, the normal physiological function of PrP remains poorly understood, mainly owing to the absence of clear phenotypes in mice lacking PrP. Here, we show that when PrP is depleted in zebrafish embryos, dramatic phenotypes ensue, severely affecting the development of early and late (neural) structures. We examined the mechanisms responsible for some of these defects, and found that fish and mammalian PrPs play conserved roles in cell–cell communication, by directly mediating cell adhesion and by triggering cellular signals that further modulate the function of other adhesion molecules. In the early zebrafish embryo, these activities control not only tissue integrity and cell morphology, but also the complex cellular movements that give rise to germ layers. This study describes—to our knowledge—the first known in vivo function of PrP and its molecular cellular basis, which may provide helpful insights into the role of PrP in the adult brain and its proposed connections to prion-induced neurotoxicity.
