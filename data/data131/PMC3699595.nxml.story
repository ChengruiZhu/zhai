Double-stranded RNA-dependent protein kinase (PKR) is one of the players in the cellular antiviral responses and is involved in transcriptional stimulation through activation of NF-κB. Treatment of the human osteosarcoma cell line MG63 with the protein phosphatase inhibitor okadaic acid stimulated the expression and phosphorylation of IκBα, as judged from the results of real-time PCR and western blot analysis. We investigated the functional relationship between PKR and signal transduction of NF-κB by establishing PKR-K/R cells that produced a catalytically inactive mutant of PKR. Phosphorylation of eIF-2α, a substrate of PKR, was not stimulated by okadaic acid in the PKR-K/R cells, whereas okadaic acid induced phosphorylation of eIF-2α in MG63 cells. Phosphorylation of NF-κB in MG63 cells was stimulated by okadaic acid; however, okadaic acid did not induce phosphorylation of NF-κB in the PKR-K/R cells. Finally, okadaic acid-induced apoptosis was inhibited in the PKR-K/R cells. Our results suggest that okadaic acid-induced phosphorylation of IκBα was mediated by PKR kinase activity, thus, indicating the involvement of this kinase in the control mechanism governing the activation of NF-κB and induction of apoptosis.
