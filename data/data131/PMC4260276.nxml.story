The diagnostic accuracy of nuclear medicine reporting can be improved by awareness of these instrument-related artifacts. Both awareness and experience are also important when it comes to detecting and identifying normal (and abnormal) variants. We present a case of hot spot on the upper right chest in the region of right subclavicular region resulting from injection of radiotracer from central subclavian line. A 52-year-old woman with a history of left breast cancer and recent bone pain was referred to our nuclear medicine department for skeletal survey. Anterior views of chest show a focus of increased radiotracer uptake corresponding to anterior arch of one of the right second rib. The nuclear physician reported it as a focal rib bony lesion and recommended radiological evaluation. As technician later explained, physicians realized that injection site was a central subclavian line on the right side and hot spot on that region is due to injection site. The appearance of both skeletal and soft-tissue uptake depends heavily on imaging technique (such as the route of radiotracer administration) and the interpreting physicians should be aware of the impact of technical factors on image quality.
