To explore the key genes associated with both PCOS and breast cancer, we overlapped the synchronously differently expressed genes in two obese insulin-resistant GEO datasets in muscle tissue and genes exert essential roles in breast cancer prognosis together base on the following reasons: (1) Androgens excess is believed to contribute to the onset of both PCOS and breast cancer. (2) PCOS is usually complicated with metabolic symptoms, such as obesity and insulin-resistance. (3) Muscle is the main place where energy metabolism and material metabolism take place. Consequently, 53 genes were found, functionally enriched in pathways such as pyruvate metabolism, muscle system process and development of primary male sexual characteristics etc. We further lay our eyes on genes correlated with male sexual characteristics, which may be involved in the onset of both PCOS and breast cancer. Three genes were indicated to be associated with this process, including hydroxysteroid (17-beta) dehydrogenase 4/HSD17B4, platelet-derived growth factor receptor, alpha polypeptide/PDGFRA and high-mobility group box 2/HMGB2. Gene-drug interaction network about the three genes were then constructed. Drugs or chemicals that contribute to correcting the disorder of lipid metabolism were detected to restore the abnormal expression of the three genes in PCOS, such as simvastatin, bezafibrate, fenofibrate et al, which provide further choices for managing patients with PCOS.
