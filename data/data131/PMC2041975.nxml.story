Networks are a simple and general way of representing natural phenomena that range in scale from the social interactions between people to the organization of circuits on a microchip. Many networks have been found to contain repeated patterns of connections between small groups of nodes. These patterns, termed network motifs, are thought to be involved in controlling the flow of information through the network. This article investigates the processes that led to the formation of the two most common types of motif in the network controlling gene expression in baker's yeast. Around 100 million y ago, yeast's ancestor underwent a whole-genome duplication, which resulted in the organism containing four copies of each gene rather than the usual two. The duplicated genes that remain in the yeast genome are used to infer the two mechanisms that give rise to network motifs. These are rewiring of interactions between genes, and the duplication of proteins that control gene expression (transcription factors). These two processes are complementary with the rewiring mechanism enabling duplicated transcription factors to regulate the expression of different genes. It appears likely that these two processes are involved in enabling the increases in complexity that are associated with multicellular life.
