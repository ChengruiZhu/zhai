For imaging of bony structures, especially for the anterior and lateral skull base in ORL medicine, cone beam computed tomography (CBCT) is an increasingly used alternative to CT, with a lower exposition to plain radiography that makes its use for imaging, particularly in children, very interesting. The aim of this study was to analyse possible indications and settings for CBCT in children and compare them to those of adults. A total of 554 patients (age range 0-18 years, mean age 10.36 years), who underwent CBCT between 01/2004-06/2013 in the ENT department at the university clinic of Marburg were enrolled in this retrospective analysis to evaluate technical parameters and indications. Data on CBCT of all children were compared with previously published data collected from 1730 adults who were diagnosed with the help of CBCT in the ENT department at the university clinic of Marburg, during the years 2012-2013. The most frequent indications of CBCT in children vs. adults were in the anterior skull base region: mid-facial trauma (60.4%) vs. chronic rhinosinusitis (54.8%), disturbed nasal breathing (13.9% vs. 13.0%) and chronic rhinosinusitis (12%) vs. mid-facial trauma (10.8%). For the lateral skull base the main indications were cholesteatoma (20.3%) vs. position control of cochlear implant (CI) electrode (31.2%), chronic otorrhoea (17.5%) vs. cholesteatoma (20.9%), and position control of CI electrode (11.8%) vs. chronic otitis media mesotympanalis (6.8%). CBCT is a suitable imaging modality for bony structures in adults and children. Settings mainly depend on the region of interest. One aim should also be to reduce exposure to radiation in both adults and children.
