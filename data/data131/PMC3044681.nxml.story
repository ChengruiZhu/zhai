The ability of sexually reproducing organisms to produce viable offspring depends on their ability to faithfully execute meiosis. Meiosis is a specialized set of two cell divisions that ensures that each sperm and egg receives only one copy of each pair of chromosomes. Thus, in human females, although virtually all somatic cells carry 23 pairs of homologous chromosomes (for a total of 46 chromosomes), the egg needs to possess only one copy of each chromosome (for a total of 23). This reduction in chromosome number requires three basic steps: the pairing of homologous chromosomes, the linking of those pairs by recombination, and the separation of those pairs into two daughter cells at the first meiotic division. Unfortunately, little is known about the mechanism(s) by which the sites of recombination are chosen. Here we describe a Drosophila protein called Trem that both binds to meiotic chromosomes and defines the first known step of recombination initiation in Drosophila. Our studies of the functional anatomy of the Trem protein and the nature of the mutant defect provide important clues to the puzzle of how recombination is initiated. Such clues will help us understand how the cell controls this critical meiotic process.
