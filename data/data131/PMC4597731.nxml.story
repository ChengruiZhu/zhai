Thirty eight patients with type IIB2 clavicula fractures according to Robinson classification were retrospectively reviewed. 20 patients who were treated conservatively were enrolled as group A and 18 patients who were operated with locked plate and screws were enrolled as group B. All patients were evaluated with Constant and Oxford scores in their last follow up control. For the patients that were treated conservatively (Group A) figure of eight bandage were applied for six week. Patients (Group B) were operated under general anesthesia in the beach chair position. A straight incision was made over the fracture line. Butterfly or free fragments in comminuted fractures were fixed to the main fragment with a lag screw in 3 patients before fracture reduction and plate fixation. Fracture reduction was performed with taking care of minimal periosteal stripping. After reduction of the main fragments, titanium alloy, locked anatomic compression plate were applied on the superior surface of the clavicle. A minimum of six cortexes were fixed with 3.5 mm locked cortical screws on the medial and lateral sides of the fracture. We did not need any Auto- or allografts during the surgery. Statistical analysis was performed between the scores of two groups. Conservative and surgical treated groups Oxford scores and Constant scores had normal distribution. For this reason Student's t test, and Non-parametric version of Studentâ€™s t test Mann Whitney U test were performed. 95% confidence interval and p <0.05 was considered significant as statistically.
