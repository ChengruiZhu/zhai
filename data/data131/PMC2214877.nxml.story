The two-microelectrode technique of voltage clamping sheep cardiac Purkinje fibers was used to examine the changes in contraction which occur during trains of voltage clamps. (A "train" is defined as a series of voltage clamps delivered at a particular rate, beginning after a rest long enough that the effects of previous stimulation have died away.) Contractions showed striking staircases, or progressive changes in peak isometric tension, during trains. Short clamps, clamps to voltages more negative than --20 or --30 mV, or holding potentials less negative than the resting potential favored negative staircases, while long clamps, clamps to positive voltages, and holding potentials near the resting potential each favored positive staircases. The staircase behavior appeared to be due to changes in the initial rate of recovery of the ability to contract. The changes in staircase behavior as a function of clamp voltage suggested that the relationship between peak tension and clamp voltage should depend on the experimental design. When the steady-state contraction was plotted as a function of clamp voltage, voltage-tension relations like those recently reported for working ventricle were obtained, with a threshold between --30 and - -40 mV and a steep relation between tension and voltage. When the first contraction after a rest was plotted, the threshold voltage was more negative, the curve was flatter, and the peak tensions at inside positive voltages were reduced.
