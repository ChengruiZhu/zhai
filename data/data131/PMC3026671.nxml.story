Two polystyrene-based capillary monolithic columns of different length (50 and 250 mm) were used to evaluate the effects of column length on gradient separation of protein digests. A tryptic digest of a 9-protein mixture was used as a test sample. Peak capacities were determined from selected extracted ion chromatograms, and tandem mass spectrometry data were used for database matching using the MASCOT search engine. Peak capacities and protein identification scores were higher for the long column with all gradients. Peak capacities appear to approach a plateau for longer gradient times; maximum peak capacity was estimated to be 294 for the short column and 370 for the long column. Analyses with similar gradient slope produced a ratio of the peak capacities of 3.36 for the long and the short column, which is slightly higher than the expected value of the square root of the column length ratio. The use of a longer monolith improves peptide separation, as reflected by higher peak capacity, and also increases protein identification, as observed from higher identification scores and a larger number of identified peptides. Attention has also been paid to the peak production rate (PPR, peak capacity per unit time). For short analysis times, the short column produces a higher PPR, while for analysis times longer than 40 min, the PPR of the 250-mm column is higher.
