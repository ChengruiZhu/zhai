Skin fibrosis is a devastating clinical condition commonly seen in skin-restricted and systemic disorders. The goal of skin fibrosis treatment is the restoration of abnormally activated dermal fibroblasts producing the excessive amount of extracellular matrix, which is generally a final consequence of the complex disease process including the activation of vascular and immune systems. Among various skin fibrotic conditions, the molecular mechanisms underlying dermal fibroblast activation have been mostly well studied in systemic sclerosis (SSc). SSc is a multisystem autoimmune and vascular disease resulting in extensive fibrosis of the skin and various internal organs. Since SSc pathogenesis is believed to include all the critical components regulating tissue fibrosis, the studies on anti-fibrotic drugs against SSc provide us much useful information regarding the strategy for the treatment of various skin fibrotic conditions. In the recent decade, as is the case with other autoimmune and inflammatory diseases, the molecular targeting therapy with monoclonal antibody has been clinically well examined in SSc. Promising clinical outcomes are so far reported in tocilizumab (an anti-IL-6 receptor antibody), rituximab (an anti-CD20 antibody), and fresolimumab (an anti-TGF-β antibody). The analysis of gene expression profiles in skin lesions of SSc patients treated with tocilizumab or fresolimumab revealed a critical role of monocyte-macrophage lineage cells in the development of skin fibrosis and the involvement of IL-6 and TGF-β in the activation of those cells. Considering that B cells modulate the differentiation and activation of macrophages, favorable clinical outcomes of rituximab treatment imply the central role of B cell/monocyte-macrophage lineage cell axis in the pathogenesis of SSc. This scenario may be applicable at least partly to other skin fibrotic conditions. In this review article, the currently available data on these drugs are summarized and the future directions are discussed.
