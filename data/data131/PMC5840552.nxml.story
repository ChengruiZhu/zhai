Transplantation of placenta-derived multipotent cells (PDMCs) is a promising treatment method for many diseases. However, the impact of PDMCs on colon cancer has not yet been studied. PDMCs were obtained from rat placentas by culturing tissue explants. Colon cancer was experimentally induced in male albino Wistar rats by administering 20 mg/kg dimethylhydrazine (DMH) once a week for 20 consecutive weeks. The administration of the PDMCs was performed at the 20th week after the first DMH injection. The number and size of each tumour lesion were calculated in the 5th week after transplantation. The tumour type was determined by standard histological methods. To study the engraftment of PDMCs in the body of rats, the cells were transduced with enhanced green fluorescent protein. Cell engraftment was determined by assessing the presence of EGFP by PCR and immunohistochemistry. Survival of all rats was monitored daily. Allogeneic transplantation of PDMCs to rats at middle phase of DMH-induced colon carcinogenesis did not significantly influence the number of neoplasms and the parameters of mean and total tumour area, but led to an increase in size of the most invasiveness tumours. Intravenous allogeneic transplantation of PDMCs reduced the survival rate of rats with colon cancer by 17 days. PDMCs from rats engrafted into tissues of the normal intestine, tumours, lungs, liver, and spleen of rats for five weeks after intravenous transplantation. These results suggest that intravenous allogeneic transplantation of PDMCs promotes colon cancer progression and has a negative impact on survival of rats.
