The anti-glioma effect of temozolomide (Tem) is sometimes undermined by the emerging resistance. Recently, resveratrol (Res), herbal medicine extracted from grape seeds, has been demonstrated for its potential use in chemosensitization. In the current study, both these drugs were loaded simultaneously into nanoparticles with methoxy poly(ethylene glycol)-poly epsilon caprolactone (mPEG-PCL) as drug carriers in order to achieve better antitumor efficiency. Tem/Res-coloaded mPEG-PCL nanoparticles were constructed, characterized, and tested for antitumor effect on glioma cells by using in vitro and xenograft model system. The nanoparticle constructs were satisfactory with drug loading content (Res =~12.4%; Tem =~9.3%) and encapsulation capacity of >85% for both the drugs. In addition, the coencapsulation led to better in vitro stability of the nanoparticles than Tem-loaded nanoparticles. An in vitro uptake study demonstrated a high uptake efficiency of the nanoparticles by glioma cells. The synergistic antitumor effect against glioma cells was observed in the combinational treatment of Res and Tem. Tem/Res-coloaded nanoparticles induced higher apoptosis in U87 glioma cells as compared to cells treated by the combination of free drugs. Tem/Res-coloaded particles caused more effective inhibition of phosphor-Akt, leading to upregulation of the downstream apoptotic proteins. In addition, the in vivo study showed the superior tumor delaying effect of coloaded nanoparticles than that of free drug combination. These results suggest that Tem/Res-coloaded nanoparticles could be a potential useful chemotherapeutic formulation for glioma therapy.
