 genes in patients with esophageal cancer were 72.4% (42/58), 1.7% (1/58) and 3.4% (2/58), respectively, which were significantly different from those in the control group [7.1% (3/42), 90.5 (38/42), and 83.3% (35/42), respectively]. The mRNA expression level of RECK is only equal to the 2.3% of that in the control group, while the mRNA expression levels of P53 and RUNX were 65.1 and 47.2 times higher than those in the control group, respectively (p<0.05). ELISA showed that RECK protein level in the observation group (0.12±0.05) µg/l, was significantly lower than the control group (3.46±0.08) µg/l (p<0.05), while, P53 and RUNX protein levels in observation group were significantly higher than that in healthy people (6.43±0.12 µg/l vs. 0.64±0.06 µg/l and 4.32±0.14 µg/l vs. 0.53±0.09 µg/l, respectively), and the results were similar to western blot. The data of immunohistochemistry showed that the proportion of RECK protein positive cells in the observation group was significantly lower than that in the control group (9.5 vs. 82.3%, P<0.05), while the proportions of P53 and RUNX protein positive cell in the observation group were significantly higher than those in the control group (78.4 vs. 11.1% and 87.3 vs. 9.06%), respectively, (P<0.05). This study concluded that, in patients with esophageal cancer, the methylation of
