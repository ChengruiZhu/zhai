Transmission of birdsong across generations requires tight interactions between auditory and vocal systems. However, how these interactions take place is poorly understood. We studied neuronal activity in the brain area located at the intersection between auditory and song motor areas, which is known as the nucleus interface of the nidopallium. By recording during singing from neurons in the nucleus interface of the nidopallium that project to motor areas, we found that their spiking precedes peaks in vocal amplitudes by about 50 ms. Notably, quasi-identical notes produced at different times in the song motif were preceded by highly similar spike patterns in these projection neurons. Such local isometry between output from the nucleus interface of the nidopallium and vocalizations suggests that projection neurons in this brain area code for imminent acoustic events within vocal performance. In support of this conclusion, during singing, projection neurons do not respond to playback of white noise sound stimuli, and activity in the nucleus interface of the nidopallium precedes by about 50 ms neural activity in the avian analogue of auditory cortex. Therefore, we conclude that the role of neuronal activity in the nucleus interface of the nidopallium could be to link desired auditory targets to suitable motor commands required for hitting these targets.
