Stimulation of Hedgehog (Hh) signaling induces carcinogenesis or promotes cell survival in cancers of multiple organs. In epithelial cancer with aberrant Hedgehog activation, abrogation of Hedgehog signaling by cyclopamine, a naturally occurring Hedgehog-specific small-molecule inhibitor, causes profound inhibition of tumor growth. In the present study, cyclopamine displayed a significant potency in suppressing the proliferation of both estrogen-responsive (MCF-7) and estrogen-independent (MDA-MB-231) human breast cancer cells. Cyclopamine induced a robust G1 cell cycle arrest and elicited notable effects on the expression of cyclin D1 through modulation of the MAPK/ERK signaling pathway. Cyclopamine also inhibited the invasive ability of both breast cancer cell lines by suppressing the expression levels of NF-κB, MMP2 and MMP9 protein. Furthermore, in estrogen-responsive MCF-7 cells, cyclopamine significantly downregulated the production of estrogen receptor-α protein. Our results implicate cyclopamine as a novel, potent inhibitor of human breast cancer proliferation and estrogen responsiveness that could potentially be developed into a promising therapeutic agent for the treatment of breast cancer.
