 iodoacetate in the dark causes a marked progressive loss of potassium and gain of sodium, phenomena which do not occur when the alga is illuminated. Evidence for the penetration of the inhibitor into the cell in the presence of light is presented. The iodoacetate effect on potassium and sodium content, once established, can be "washed out" of the alga when the plant is placed in light and running sea water without the inhibitor. Illumination and increased temperature each favor a more rapid exchange of tissue for environmental potassium ion. 4. In the interpretation of these findings it is emphasized that metabolic work, perhaps in the form of ion transports, must be done by the cell to compensate for the continual flow of potassium ion and sodium ion with their respective concentration gradients and thus maintain homeostasis within the cell. Evidence is presented which indicates separate mechanisms for the distribution of sodium and potassium in this organism. It is further suggested that the degradation of phosphoglyceric acid, an important glycolytic and photosynthetic intermediate, or one of the products of its metabolism supplied the energy for these ion transports(s). The role of permeability
