‐dimethyl)benzenamine, we demonstrate that the “Summary Visualization Tools” can be used to examine distributions of gene and pathway BMD values, and to derive a potential point of departure value based on summary statistics. By applying filters on enrichment P‐values and minimum number of significant genes, the “Functional Enrichment Analysis” tool enables the user to select biological processes or pathways that are selectively perturbed by chemical exposure and identify the related BMD. The “Multiple Dataset Comparison” tool enables comparison of gene and pathway BMD values across multiple experiments (e.g., across timepoints or tissues). The “BMDL‐BMD Range Plotter” tool facilitates the observation of BMD trends across biological processes or pathways. Through our case studies, we demonstrate that BMDExpress Data Viewer is a useful tool to visualize, explore and analyze BMDExpress output files. Visualizing the data in this manner enables rapid assessment of data quality, model fit, doses of peak activity, most sensitive pathway perturbations and other metrics that will be useful in applying toxicogenomics in risk assessment. © 2015 Her Majesty the Queen in Right of Canada.
