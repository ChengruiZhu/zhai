Despite the clear functional importance of structure in RNA molecules, it remains very difficult to correctly identify and annotate similar RNA structures because their sequences are often poorly conserved even for RNAs that form very similar higher-order structures. A solution is to use a metric that identifies structural motifs but this, too, is difficult because RNA structure modeling based on sequence alone is generally not very accurate. In this work, we use SHAPE chemical probing to obtain model-free information about RNA structure and then exploit this information to align RNAs by sequence. We show for ribosomal RNAs that sequence alignments based on SHAPE experimental information alone are as accurate as those that actually use sequence information. In addition, we identify regions in the 16S ribosomal RNA that form conserved secondary structures that are different from currently accepted models. These differences, rather than being errors, reveal sites of conformational flexibility that may underlie mechanistic functions in ribosome assembly and translation regulation. We anticipate that structure-informed sequence alignment and structure modeling will become broadly useful tools in RNA function analysis.
