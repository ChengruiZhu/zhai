, at Phu Khieo Wildlife Sanctuary, Thailand, to inform hypotheses of their evolutionary origins. Female Assamese macaques reproduce seasonally and do not signal ovulation, resulting in low mating and paternity skew. However, male–immature associations are predicted by paternity, and male behavior potentially reflects paternal effort. We present focal animal data on 12 immatures followed from birth beyond weaning into their juvenile life (1188 focal hours). The distribution of composite sociality indices suggests that male–immature relationships were highly differentiated. Association patterns and the degree of differentiation remained stable from 6 mo well into the juvenile phase, suggesting that male protection extends beyond the phase of high infanticide risk. Based on Hinde indices, immatures were responsible for maintaining the relationships. The likelihood that an infant was associated with its preferred male increased if the mother was absent and if other males were present in proximity, suggesting that immatures sought protection. The presence of the preferred male did not decrease the rate of mild aggression immatures received from group members, but the stronger the relationship between an immature and a male, the more often it received agonistic support from him. Future studies will have to assess whether this agonistic support translates into improved fitness and represents true paternal care.
