/μL. Ultrasonography showed splenomegaly (10.8 × 6.6 cm), and a hypoechoic splenic mass (8.0 × 7.0 cm). Color doppler ultrasound revealed blood flow within the mass, and the mass density was homogeneous on abdominal computed tomography (CT). Contrast-enhanced CT showed heterogeneous enhancement of the splenic mass during the arterial phase. Positron emission tomography (PET)-CT showed no significant fludeoxyglucose (FDG) accumulation within the mass. The differential diagnosis included splenic hamartoma, splenic hemangioma, splenomegaly associated with extramedullary hematopoiesis, and malignant tumor, including solitary splenic metastasis. A laparoscopic splenectomy was performed due to the possibility of malignancy, the presence of thrombocytopenia, and the risk of splenic rupture. The resected specimen showed a localized, well-demarcated, 8.0 × 7.0 cm splenic mass. Histological examination revealed abnormal red pulp proliferation and the absence of normal splenic structures. The patient’s post-operative course was uneventful. His platelet count improved on post-operative day 1 and he was discharged on post-operative day 9. He remained in good health with a normal platelet count one month after surgery.
