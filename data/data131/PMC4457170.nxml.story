Breast cancer is among the most commonly diagnosed cancers in the United States. Despite treatment, 30% to 40% of women with early-stage or localized invasive breast cancer will eventually develop metastatic disease. Women with metastatic breast cancer (MBC) are living longer lives with the advent of new therapies. Currently, treatment for MBC can consist of a variety of approaches including chemotherapy, targeted therapy, and hormonal therapy, with disease-related, treatment-related, and patient-related factors guiding the selection and sequencing of these agents. In addition to controlling disease progression, strategies to improve or maintain quality of life are particularly important. For women with hormone receptorâ€“positive disease, hormonal therapy is typically the first-line treatment of choice given the overall efficacy and favorable safety profiles of these agents; additional lines of other hormonal therapies are often administered upon disease progression. Other factors that must be considered by the practitioner to achieve optimal outcomes for the patient with MBC include the presence of comorbid illness and the educational, psychosocial, and supportive care needs of the patient.
