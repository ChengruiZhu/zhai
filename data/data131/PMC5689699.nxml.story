The unfavourable clinical outcomes of host cell-seeded scaffolds for bladder augmentation warrant improved bioactive biomaterials. This study aimed to examine the feasibility of adipose-derived stem cells (ASCs)-seeded bilayer bladder acellular matrix graft (BAMG)-silk fibroin (SF) scaffold in enhancing bladder reconstruction. Sprague Dawley rats were randomly divided into three groups: the BAMG-SF-ASCs group, the acellular BAMG-SF group and the cystotomy group. The BAMG-SF-ASCs group was sampled at 2, 4 and 12 weeks, and compared with the other groups at 12 weeks. In the BAMG-SF-ASCs group, the normal bladder contour was reformed similar to that in the cystotomy group, with abundant urothelium and smooth muscle regeneration, as well as a suitable scaffold degradation speed, and trivial fibrosis and inflammation. The ASCs seeded in BAMG-SF were maintained in the regenerated region during the 12-week experimental period and significantly enhanced the vessel density, nerve regeneration and bladder function compared with acellular BAMG-SF. In addition, the BAMG-SF-ASCs group presented elevated levels of SDF-1α, VEGF and their receptors, with an obvious increase in ERK 1/2 phosphorylation. BAMG-SF is a promising biomaterial for ASCs seeding to facilitate bladder augmentation and demonstrated an enhanced angiogenic potential possibly related to the SDF-1α/CXCR4 pathway via ERK 1/2 activation.
