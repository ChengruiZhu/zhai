The QSAR principles were systematically applied to a given pool of molecules with genotoxic activity in rats to elucidate their carcinogenic mechanisms. Once defined, the endpoint associated with ligand-DNA interaction was used to select variables that retained the main Hansch physicochemical parameters of hydrophobicity, polarizability and stericity, computed by the custom PM3 semiempirical quantum method. The trial and test sets of working molecules were established by implementing the normal Gaussian principle of activities that applies when the applicability domain is not restrained to the congeneric compounds, as in the present study. The application of the residual, self-consistent QSAR method and the factor (or average) method yielded results characterized by extremely high and low correlations, respectively, with the latter resembling the direct activity to parameter QSARs. Nevertheless, such contrasted correlations were further incorporated into the advanced statistical minimum paths principle, which selects the minimum hierarchy from Euclidean distances between all considered QSAR models for all combinations and considered molecular sets (i.e., school and validation). This ultimately led to a mechanistic picture based on the identified alpha, beta and gamma paths connecting structural indicators (i.e., the causes) to the global endpoint, with all included causes. The molecular mechanism preserved the self-consistent feature of the residual QSAR, with each descriptor appearing twice in the course of one cycle of ligand-DNA interaction through inter-and intra-cellular stages.
