We experienced two cases of atypical lateral dislocations of meniscal bearing in UKA (unicompartmental knee arthroplasty) without manifest symptoms. The dislocated bearing, which jumped onto the wall of tibial components, was found on radiographs in periodic medical examination although they could walk. Two thicker size bearing exchanges were promptly performed before metallosis and loosening of components. Continual examination is important to mobile bearing type of UKA because slight or less symptoms may disclose such unique dislocation. One case showed malrotation of the femoral component on 3D image. Anteroposterior view hardly disclosed the malrotation of the femoral component. Epicondylar view is an indispensable view of importance, and it can demonstrate the rotation of the femoral component. The the femoral distal end is wedge shaped and is wider posteriorly. If the femoral component is set according to the shape of medial condyle, the femoral component shifts to medial site compared with tibial component in flexion. It can account for such rare dislocation as follows. If excessive force applies on most medial side of the bearing during flexion, the lateral part of the bearing pops and the force squeezes it laterally simultaneously. Finally, the bearing jumps onto the lateral wall of the tibial component.
