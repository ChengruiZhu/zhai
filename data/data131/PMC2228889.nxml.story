Planar lipid bilayer recordings were used to study Ca channels from bovine cardiac sarcolemmal membranes. Ca channel activity was recorded in the absence of nucleotides or soluble enzymes, over a range of membrane potentials and ionic conditions that cannot be achieved in intact cells. The dihydropyridine-sensitive L-type Ca channel, studied in the presence of Bay K 8644, was identified by a detailed comparison of its properties in artificial membranes and in intact cells. L-type Ca channels in bilayers showed voltage dependence of channel activation and inactivation, open and closed times, and single-channel conductances in Ba2+ and Ca2+ very similar to those found in cell- attached patch recordings. Open channels were blocked by micromolar concentrations of external Cd2+. In this cell-free system, channel activity tended to decrease during the course of an experiment, reminiscent of Ca2+ channel "rundown" in whole-cell and excised-patch recordings. A purely voltage-dependent component of inactivation was observed in the absence of Ca2+ stores or changes in intracellular Ca2+. Millimolar internal Ca2+ reduced unitary Ba2+ influx but did not greatly increase the rate or extent of inactivation or the rate of channel rundown. In symmetrical Ba2+ solutions, unitary conductance saturated as the Ba2+ concentration was increased up to 500 mM. The bilayer recordings also revealed activity of a novel Ca2+-permeable channel, termed "B-type" because it may contribute a steady background current at negative membrane potentials, which is distinct from L-type or T-type Ca channels previously reported. Unlike L-type channels, B- type channels have a small unitary Ba2+ conductance (7 pS), but do not discriminate between Ba2+ and Ca2+, show no obvious sensitivity to Bay K 8644, and do not run down. Unlike either L- or T-type channels, B- type channels did not require a depolarization for activation and displayed mean open times of greater than 100 ms.
