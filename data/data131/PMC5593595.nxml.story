We conducted this retrospective study to investigate whether microwave ablation (MWA) of primary tumor sites plus epidermal growth factor receptor-tyrosine kinase inhibitors (EGFR-TKIs) could improve survival in advanced non small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with EGFR mutations. MWA was conducted at the primary tumor sites, followed by EGFR-TKIs in the MWA plus EGFR-TKIs group. EGFR-TKIs were administered until disease progression or intolerable toxicity. The primary endpoint was progression-free survival (PFS); secondary endpoints were overall survival (OS) and objective response rate (ORR). A total of 58 patients were recruited, including 34 in the MWA plus EGFR-TKIs group and 24 in the EGFR-TKIs group. No significant difference in ORR was observed with MWA treatment (61.8% vs. 45.8%, p = 0.230). Patients treated with MWA plus EGFR-TKIs failed to show superior survival in either PFS (13.2 months vs. 11.6 months, p = 0.640) or OS (39.8 months vs. 20.4 months, p = 0.288). MWA was not an independent prognostic factor for PFS or OS. MWA of primary tumor sites plus EGFR-TKIs demonstrated no survival advantage compared with EGFR-TKIs alone in advanced NSCLC patients with EGFR sensitive mutations. MWA should not be recommended for unselected patients with EGFR-sensitive mutations.
