PICT-1 is an essential ribosome biogenesis factor whose loss induces p53 accumulation and apoptosis. Here, we show that DNA damage changes PICT-1 localization and decreases PICT-1 protein levels via the proteasome pathway. Two important phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-like kinases (PIKKs), ataxia-telangiectasia mutated (ATM) and the Ku70 subunit of DNA-dependent protein kinase (DNA-PK), co-localize and interact with PICT-1 in the nucleolus. Computational prediction of phosphorylation sites and detection using an anti-phospho-substrate antibody suggest that PICT-1 might be a substrate of PIKKs. PICT-1 S233 and T289 were identified as the key phosphorylation sites in this pathway, as mutating both to alanine abolished UVB-induced increase of PICT-1 phosporylation. Inhibition of PIKKs or ATM (with wortmannin and KU55933, respectively) prevented the agglomeration and degradation of PICT-1, suggesting that ATM is a key regulator of PICT-1. PICT-1(S233A, T289A) demonstrated marked resistance to DNA damage-induced agglomeration and loss of PICT-1. Phosphomimetic PICT-1 (S233D, T289D) showed a different nuclear distribution and was more rapidly degraded after DNA damage than wild-type PICT-1. Furthermore, both phosphorylation and degradation of PICT-1 released RPL11 from the nucleolus to the nucleoplasm, increased binding of RPL11 to MDM2, and promoted p53 accumulation and apoptosis in an ATM-dependent manner after DNA damage. These data indicate that PICT-1 is a major nucleolar sensor of the DNA damage repair response and an important upstream regulator of p53 via the RPL11-MDM2-p53 pathway.
