Perfect facial and body symmetry is an important aesthetic concept which is very difficult, if not impossible, to achieve. Yet, facial asymmetries are commonly encountered by plastic and reconstructive surgeons. Here, we present a case of posttraumatic facial asymmetry successfully treated with a unique concept of facial flap repositioning. A 25-year-old male patient visited our department with severe posttraumatic facial asymmetry. There was deviated nasal bone and implant to the right, and the actual facial appearance asymmetry was much more severe compared to the computed tomography, generally shifted to the right. After corrective rhinoplasty, we approached through intraoral incision, and much adhesion from previous surgeries was noted. We meticulously elevated the facial flap of both sides, mainly involving the cheeks. The elevated facial flap was shifted to the left, and after finding the appropriate location, we sutured the middle portion of the flap to the periosteum of anterior nasal spine for fixation. We successfully freed the deviated facial tissues and repositioned it to improve symmetry in a single stage operation. We conclude that facial flap repositioning is an effective technique for patients with multiple operation history, and such method can successfully apply to other body parts with decreased tissue laxity.
