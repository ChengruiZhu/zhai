The benefits of resection for gastric carcinoma patients with non-curative factors remain controversial. Thus, we evaluated the survival benefits of resection in these gastric carcinoma patients. We reviewed the hospital records of 467 gastric carcinoma patients with non-curative factors who had resection (n=305) and compared their clinicopathological findings with individuals (n=162) who underwent bypass or exploration from 1996 to 2010. The 3-year survival rate of patients who had resection was higher than was that of patients who did not (13.2 vs. 7.2%, respectively p<0.001). Cox's proportional hazard regression analysis revealed that only one factor was an independent, statistically significant prognostic parameter: the presence of peritoneal dissemination (risk ratio, 1.37; 95% confidence interval, 1.04â€“1.79; p<0.05). The 3-year survival rate of patients with peritoneal dissemination was higher in individuals who underwent resection compared with those who did not (9.5 vs. 4.7%, respectively; p<0.001). The current results highlight the improved survival rates of gastric carcinoma patients with non-curative factors who underwent surgery compared with those who did not. Although resection is not curative in this group of patients, we still recommend performing the procedure.
