Increasing evidence suggests that microRNAs are associated with many important biologic processes in carcinogenesis. Despite ample research revealing the dysregualtion of miR-486-5p in various cancers, little is known about the roles of miR-486-5p in colorectal carcinoma (CRC). In this study, we investigated the biological functions and molecular mechanisms of miR-486-5p in CRC growth and invasion, discussing the potential of using miR-486-5p as a biomarker for colorectal cancers. Our data revealed that miR-486-5p was significantly downregulated in CRC tissues compared with the paracancer tissue by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction and that miR-486-5p was downregulated to a greater extent in advanced stage cancer (stage III and IV) as compared to early stage cancer (stage I and II). Luciferase reporter assay verified that neuropilin-2 was a direct functional target of miR-486-5p in the CRC cells, and upregulation of miR-486-5p in CRC cells negatively correlated with the expression of neuropilin-2. Furthermore, overexpression of miR-486-5p inhibited the tumor growth and lymphangiogenesis in nude mice, which was reversed by overexpression of neuropilin-2. Taken together, our study suggested miR-486-5p might be a suppressor of CRC.
