 Continuous phase-contrast observations have been made on macrophages following exposure to chloroquine. The initial abnormality is the appearance in the Golgi region of small vacuoles with an intermediate density between that of pinosomes and granules. Over the course of 1â€“2 hr these vacuoles grow larger and accumulate amorphous material or lipid. Pinosomes or granules frequently fuse with the toxic vacuoles. Chloroquine derivatives can be seen by fluorescence microscopy; the drug is rapidly taken up by macrophages and localized in small foci in the Golgi region. Chloroquine continues to produce vacuoles when pinocytosis is suppressed. Electron microscopic studies of chloroquine effects on macrophages preincubated with colloidal gold to label predominately pinosomes or granules suggest that toxic vacuoles can arise from unlabeled organelles. Later vacuoles regularly acquire gold label, apparently by fusion, from both granules and pinosomes. L cells also develop autophagic vacuoles after exposure to chloroquine. Smooth endoplasmic reticulum apparently is involved early in the autophagic process in these cells. Information now available suggests an initial action of chloroquine on Golgi or smooth endoplasmic reticulum vesicles, and on granules, with alterations in their membranes leading to fusion with one another and with pinosomes.
