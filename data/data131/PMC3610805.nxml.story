Variation in gene expression across different individuals has been found to play a role in susceptibility to different diseases. In addition, many genetic variants that are linked to changes in expression have been found to date. However, their joint ability to accurately predict these changes is not well understood and has rarely been evaluated. Here, we devise a method that uses multiple genetic variants to explain the variation in expression of genes across individuals. One important aspect of our method is its robustness, in that our predictions agree well between training and test sets. Thus, although the number of genes that could be explained is relatively small, the identity and quantitative degree to which genes can be predicted is known in advance. We also present an extension to our method that integrates different genomic annotations such as location of the genetic variant or its context to differentially weigh the genetic variants in our model and improve predictions. Finally, genes that are successfully predicted have, on average, higher expression and more variability across individuals, providing insight into the characteristics of the types of genes that can be predicted by our method.
