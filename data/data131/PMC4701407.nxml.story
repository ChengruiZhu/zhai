Because the difference between the two trial arms in terms of the primary endpoint was greater than the researchers’ predefined non-inferiority limit, these findings suggest that CTX discontinuation is inferior to CTX continuation among ART-treated, immune-reconstituted HIV-infected adults living in a malaria-endemic region. The accuracy of these findings may be affected by the lack of blinding—the clinicians’ care decisions and the patients’ threshold for seeking care may have been influenced by their knowledge of their trial arm assignment. Overall, however, these findings suggest that malaria endemicity should be considered when making decisions about whether to stop CTX after ART-driven immune reconstitution. Indeed, in December 2014, following the release of preliminary data from this trial and the completion of an independent trial on CTX discontinuation, WHO issued supplemental guidelines on CTX prophylaxis. These state that CTX prophylaxis can be discontinued for HIV-infected adults who are clinically stable on ART and have evidence of immune recovery and viral suppression but recommend that CTX prophylaxis be continued regardless of CD4 cell count or HIV/AIDS clinical stage in settings where malaria is endemic and/or severe bacterial infections are common.
