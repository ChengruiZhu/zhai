Laparoscopic surgery is gaining popularity among the surgical community. While its prevalence expands, the need for reliable training and assessment tools is becoming increasingly important. Laparoscopic skills are not an innate behavior, nor can they be easily mimicked, and can only be acquired through hands-on training. A consensus exists among physicians that establishment and evaluation of technical skill in surgical training programs are inadequate and in need of improvement. A validated, reliable bench model that could train and assess could be standardized and provide numerous benefits including determination of which medical students should consider a career in surgery, valuable feedback to residents, a tracking mechanism of resident performance, a possible certification and recertification tool, and to allow for interinstitutional comparison. To this end, several potentially successful bench models testing dexterity, hand-eye coordination, and depth perception have been developed. A few models have been proven to be both valid and reliable indicators of technical skill. Although the future remains uncertain, enough groundwork has been laid to begin incorporating technical skill training and assessment into surgical training programs.
