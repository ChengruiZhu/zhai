Breast metastases from distant carcinoma are infrequent, and cervix carcinoma is rarely the primary lesion. We describe the first case of a cervical squamous cell carcinoma with breast metastasis mimicking an inflammatory breast cancer in a 74-year-old woman. Seventeen months after the treatment of a primary tumor, the patient developed breast lesions looking like an inflammatory breast tumor. After a 1-year delay due to the patient's refusal, pathological examination and immunohistochemistry confirmed the diagnosis of breast metastasis from a poorly differentiated squamous cell carcinoma. The volume of the breast was huge, associated with axillary lymphadenopathies and multiple lung metastases. Despite platinum-based chemotherapy, the disease progressed and the patient died rapidly, 3 months after the first chemotherapy cycle and 15 months after the first mammary symptoms. We review the literature concerning breast metastases from gynecologic cancers and, particularly, from cervical squamous cell carcinoma. Differential diagnosis of such lesions may be problematic but is essential to avoid unnecessary mutilating surgery and to institute the appropriate systemic therapy. The prognosis is poor.
