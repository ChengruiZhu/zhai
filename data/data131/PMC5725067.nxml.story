The microRNAs are a group of 20 nucleotides-long non-coding RNAs. By binding to the 3’UTR region of target mRNA, microRNAs can perform extensive actions mediating gene expression at post-trancriptional stages. It makes microRNAs serve as very crucial regulators in various biological progress including carcinogenesis. Long non-coding RNAs, however, are a subgroup of RNA with the length of 200 nucleotides. Unlike microRNAs, long non-coding RNAs can form secondary of tertiary domain based on their length. With the ability of directly interacting with DNA, RNA, protein, long non-coding RNAs have promoting or inhibitive functions in gene expression regulation. Furthermore, the abnormal expression of certain long non-coding RNAs has roused people’s interest in the role of long non-coding RNAs in tumorigenesis. Although the connection between microRNA/long non-coding RNA and CCA has been a hot field to researchers, the link between molecular mechanism and clinical outcome has been barely built. This review takes a retrospect at the latest researches on the link between microRNA/long non-coding RNA and cholangiocarcinoma and the potential of microRNA/long non-coding RNA serving as distinctive biomarkers for CCA in clinical practice.
