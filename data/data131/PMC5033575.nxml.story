When you move a cup to a new location on a table, the movement of lifting, transporting, and setting down the cup appears to be completely automatic. Although the hand could take continuously many different paths and move on any temporal trajectory, real movements are highly regular and reproducible. From repetition to repetition movements vary, and the pattern of variance reflects movement conditions and movement timing. If another person performs the same task, the movement will be similar. When we look more closely, however, there are systematic individual differences. Some people will overcompensate when avoiding an obstacle and some people will systematically move slower than others. When we want to understand human movement, all these aspects are important. We want to know which parts of a movement are common across people and we want to quantify the different types of variability. Thus, the models we use to analyze movement data should contain all the mentioned effects. In this work, we developed a framework for statistical analysis of movement data that respects these structures of movements. We showed how this framework modeled the individual characteristics of participants better than other state-of-the-art modeling approaches. We combined the timing-and-path-separating model with a novel factor analysis model for analyzing the effect of obstacles on spatial movement paths. This combination allowed for an unprecedented ability to quantify and display different sources of variation in the data. We analyzed data from a designed experiment of arm movements under various obstacle avoidance conditions. Using the proposed statistical models, we documented three findings: a linearly amplified deviation in mean path related to increase in obstacle height; a consistent asymmetric pattern of variation along the movement path related to obstacle placement; and the existence of obstacle-distance invariant focal points where mean trajectories intersect in the frontal and vertical planes.
