The purpose of this study is to characterize the smooth muscle differentiation of purified human muscle-derived cells (hMDCs). The isolation and purification of hMDCs were conducted by modified preplate technique and Dynal CD34 cell selection. Smooth muscle cell differentiation was induced by the use of smooth muscle induction medium (SMIM) and low-serum medium. The gene expressions at the mRNA and protein levels of undifferentiated and differentiated hMDCs were tested by RT-PCR, Western blot and immunofluorescence studies. Western blot and immunofluorescence studies demonstrated the purified hMDCs cultured in SMIM for 4 weeks and expressed significant amount of smooth muscle myosin heavy chain (MHC) and Î±-smooth muscle actin (ASMA). The cells cultured in low-serum medium for 4 weeks also expressed ASMA, while the control group did not. RT-PCR analysis showed increased gene expression of smooth muscle markers, such as ASMA, Calponin, SM22, Caldesmon, Smoothelin and MHC when purified hMDCs were exposed to SMIM for 2 and 4 weeks when compared to the controls. In conclusion, we confirmed the smooth muscle differentiation capability of purified hMDCs. The gene expression of smooth muscle differentiation of purified hMDCs was characterized. These cells may be potential biomaterials for human tissue regeneration.
