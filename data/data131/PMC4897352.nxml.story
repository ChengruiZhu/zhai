The practice of laparoscopic appendectomy as an ambulatory surgery is uncommon even in apex institutes, more so in developing countries, despite proven feasibility. To promote this practice in the developing countries like ours, we attempted to find the safety and cost effectiveness in such institutions which have limited resources. Thirty cases of symptomatic appendicitis were tried for same day discharge after laparoscopic appendectomies. The results were encouraging with 87% patients discharged on the same day and 13% on the next day in the early morning. Among the next day discharged cases, only 03% stayed for medical reasons (nausea, vomiting, and pain) while 10% stayed as their attendants declined to leave (social reasons), even though they were medically eligible for discharge from the hospital. There were no significant postoperative complications except tolerable pain in all patients and mild to moderate nausea/vomiting in 80%. There was no readmission. The mean length of hospital stay was 11.20â€‰hrs. At the time of discharge all patients were highly satisfied. We concluded that routine same day discharge is safe and feasible after appendectomies in developing countries, with social decline as the main hurdle which can be improved by proper communication.
