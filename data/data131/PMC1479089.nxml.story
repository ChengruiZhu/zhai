Diseases such as cancer are often associated with malfunctioning pathways involving several genes. Identifying modules of such genes and how the genes in each module interact with each other is helpful toward understanding the nature of these diseases. Here the authors provide a novel computational method for discovering such modules of genes merely from two sets of gene expression data, one from healthy tissues and one from tissues suffering from a particular disease. The method is based on the concept of identifying sets of genes whose joint expression state predicts the presence or absence of a particular disease with minimum uncertainty. Once such gene sets have been identified, we can then further use the microarray data to determine the “logic” that connects the genes' individual expression states related to the outcome of the disease. In turn, this logic may give us valuable insight into the nature of the pathways and how we may target some elements of these pathways for therapeutic purposes. The authors apply this methodology in a particular example and conclude that prostate cancer is often associated with cellular damage from oxidative stress combined with the inhibition of the apoptotic mechanisms normally activated by such damage.
