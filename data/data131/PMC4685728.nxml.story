Currently, the biologic sciences are a Tower of Babel, having become so highly specialized that one discipline cannot effectively communicate with another. A mechanism for evolution that integrates development and physiologic homeostasis phylogenetically has been identifiedâ€”cell-cell interactions. By reducing this process to ligand-receptor interactions and their intermediate down-stream signaling partners, it is possible, for example, to envision the functional homologies between such seemingly disparate structures and functions as the lung alveolus and kidney glomerulus, the skin and brain, or the skin and lung. For example, by showing the continuum of the lung phenotype for gas exchange at the cell-molecular level, being selected for increased surface area by augmenting lung surfactant production and function in lowering surface tension, we have determined an unprecedented structural-functional continuum from proximate to ultimate causation in evolution. It is maintained that tracing the changes in structure and function that have occurred over both the short-term history of the organism (as ontogeny), and the long-term history of the organism (as phylogeny), and how the mechanisms shared in common can account for both biologic stability and novelty, will provide the key to understanding the mechanisms of evolution. We need to better understand evolution from its unicellular origins as the Big Bang of biology.
