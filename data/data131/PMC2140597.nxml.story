. 4. The large number of atoms in the unit makes it highly probable that principal planes and secondary planes of atoms occur for every reflecting position. 5. The effect of the secondary upon the principal planes may readily account for the differences in the density of the lines produced on the negatives. 6. From theoretical considerations, reflections, such as those obtained, would occur if starch grains were built up of concentric layers of units. 7. Two other factors which might affect the density of the lines are thermal agitation and the curvature of the concentric layers. 8. A model of the starch group was constructed to scale based on the accepted sizes of the atoms involved and upon rather meager chemical evidence. The model apparently fulfills the requirements necessary to produce reflections such as were obtained. 9. The model fits the elementary cell loosely enough to suggest a low density and to allow for considerable thermal movement. At the same time, parts of it approach the faces of the cell closely enough to make cohesion seem possible. 10. The model makes clearer the basis for the assumption that reflection from certain positions would be stronger than from others. If the interpretation of the data is correct and if the assumptions made are sound, then the starch grain is built up of units arranged in concentric layers, and the units are groups of atoms, each containing 6 carbon, 10 hydrogen, and 5 oxygen atoms. Such a structure is certainly not an amorphous structure, and on the other hand it is not crystalline in the common sense of the term. Parts of the grain, it is true, act as crystals in that for certain distances the layers of units are in planes, but taken as a whole the layers are curved. As to the validity of the conclusions, those pertaining to the type of lattice and to the size of the unit may be accepted as sound in our present knowledge of x-rays and crystal structure; those, however, pertaining to the nature and the spherical arrangement of the units, while they seem convincing, need the support of further investigation into the various structures deposited by living protoplasm. In conclusion, the assumption that the units form a sort of spherical space lattice, gives a picture of the starch grain which leads us to ponder over the nature of the activity in protoplasm when it is depositing solid substances. Starch, cellulose, and pectic bodies are about the only solid deposits made directly by the living substance of plants, and all three have the same proportional formula, C
