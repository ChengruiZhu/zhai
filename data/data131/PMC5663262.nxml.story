The ideal stent must fulfil a broad range of technical requirements. Stents must be securely crimped onto the delivery balloon and, in this form, must have a low profile and be sufficiently flexible to facilitate deliverability to the lesion site without distortion or displacement. Following expansion, stents must exert sufficient radial force on the vessel wall to overcome lesion resistance and elastic recoil. To achieve an optimal lumen diameter, the lesion must be uniformly and adequately scaffolded, with minimal tissue prolapse between struts but without compromising side-branch access. Furthermore, the deployed stent must conform to the vessel curvature to minimise vessel distortion, particularly at the stent edges. Radio-opacity is also important to guide safe positioning, adequate deployment and postdilataion and to permit assessment of optimal stent expansion. Equally though, the stent lumen must also be sufficiently visible to allow radiographic assessment of flow dynamics and restenosis. Efforts to optimise one characteristic of stent design may have detrimental effects on another. Thus, currently available stents all reflect a compromise between competing desirable features and have subtle differences in their performance characteristics. Striving to achieve stents with optimal deliverability, conformability and radial strength led to a reduction in longitudinal strength. The importance of this parameter was highlighted by complications occurring in the real-world setting where percutaneous coronary intervention is often undertaken in challenging anatomy. This review focuses on aspects of stent design relevant to longitudinal strength.
