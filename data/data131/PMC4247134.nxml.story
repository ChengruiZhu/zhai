Ligand-mediated prostate cancer (PCa)-targeting gene delivery is one of the focuses of research in recent years. Our previous study reported the successful preparation of aptamer-modified nanoparticles (APT-NPs) in our laboratory and demonstrated their PCa-targeting ability in vitro. However, the mechanism underlying this PCa-targeting effect and their anticancer ability in vivo have not yet been elucidated. The objective of this study was to assess the feasibility of using APT-NPs to deliver micro RNA (miRNA) systemically to PCa cells, to testify their tumor-targeting efficiency, and to observe their biodistribution after systemic administration to a xenograft mouse model of PCa. In addition, the effect of APT depletion and endocytosis inhibitors on cellular uptake was also evaluated quantitatively in LNCaP cells to explore the internalization mechanism of APT-NPs. Finally, blood chemistry, and renal and liver function parameters were measured in the xenograft mouse model of PCa to see whether APT-NPs had any demonstrable toxicity in mice in vivo. The results showed that APT-NPs prolonged the survival duration of the PCa tumor-bearing mice as compared with the unmodified NPs. In addition, they had a potential PCa-targeting effect in vivo. In conclusion, this research provides a prototype for the safe and efficient delivery of miRNA expression vectors to PCa cells, which may prove useful for preclinical and clinical studies on the treatment of PCa.
