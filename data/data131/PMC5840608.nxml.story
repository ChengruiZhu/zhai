Tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated protein-1 (TRAP-1), a mitochondrial chaperone, contributes significantly to the progression of cancer. However, the understanding of its involvement in the clinicopathological characteristics and prognosis of colorectal cancer (CRC) remains limited. The aim of the present study was to assess the significance of TRAP-1 expression in CRC. The expression of TRAP-1 was evaluated in corresponding cancerous, paracancerous, lymph node and distant metastatic tissues of 256 cases of CRC by immunohistochemistry. The associations between TRAP-1 expression and the clinicopathological parameters and survival rates of patients was assessed. Out of 256 patients with CRC, TRAP-1 expression was detected in 203 (79.3%). TRAP-1 expression was significantly increased in cancerous tissue compared with that in corresponding paracancerous tissues (P<0.001). Overexpression of TRAP-1 was significantly associated with differentiation (P=0.011), depth of invasion (P=0.006), lymph node metastasis (P<0.001) and tumor-node-metastasis stage (P<0.001). In patients with high TRAP-1 expression, the 5-year overall survival (OS) rate was 38.0%, in contrast to 56.5% in patients with low TRAP-1 expression (P=0.003). Similarly, the 5-year progression-free survival (PFS) was 26.6% for patients with high TRAP-1 expression and 53.3% for patients with low TRAP-1 expression (P<0.001). Multivariate analyses indicated the TRAP-1 expression is an independent prognostic factor for poorer OS [P=0.015; hazard ratio (HR), 1.914] and PFS (P<0.001; HR, 2.534). Thus, TRAP-1 may serve as a potential biomarker for predicting the prognosis of patients with CRC. Specifically, overexpression of TRAP-1 may predict progression and poor survival in cases of CRC.
