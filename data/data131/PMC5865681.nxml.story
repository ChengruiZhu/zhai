Studies of the association between angiotensin II receptor type 1 A1166C (AGTR1 A1166C) polymorphism and chronic kidney disease (CKD) risk have yielded conflicting results. We conducted a combined case-control study and meta-analysis to better define this association. The case-control study included 634 end-stage renal disease (ESRD) patients and 739 healthy controls. AGTR1 A1166C genotype was determined using polymerase chain reaction and iPLEX Gold SNP genotyping methods. The meta-analysis included 24 studies found in the PubMed and Cochrane Library databases. Together, the case-control study and meta-analysis included 36 populations (7,918 cases and 6,905 controls). We found no association between the C allele and ESRD (case-control study: OR: 1.02, 95% CI: 0.77–1.37; meta-analysis: OR: 1.07; 95% CI: 0.97–1.18). Co-dominant, dominant, and recessive model results were also not significant. No known environmental factors moderated the effect of AGTR1 A1166C on CKD in our gene-environment interaction analysis. Sensitivity analysis showed an AGTR1 A1166C-CKD association in Indian populations (OR: 1.46, 95% CI: 1.26–1.69), but not in East Asian or Caucasian populations. Additional South Asian studies will be required to confirm the potential role of this polymorphism in CKD.
