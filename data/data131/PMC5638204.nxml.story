Networks and pathway-based methods are commonly used to improve the power of gene detection in associations with complex human diseases. Network diffusion approaches have shown their effectiveness and superior performance in cancer studies. Still, there are many problems such as noise and missingness with currently available human networks that bias the results of gene detection. We propose a novel graphical model-based method Conflux that overcomes several of the pitfalls of the existing state-of-the-art approaches while building on their successes. Conflux integrates genotype data with networks directly, using diffusion-like methods, but only as part of a structure in a probabilistic model to reduce the negative effect of the noise in the networks. This Bayesian framework allows Conflux to keep track of the uncertainty in the gene list that is being associated with the disease and consequently rank the genes with respect to our confidence in the association. It also allows for the discovery of gene sets that are not fully supported by the network if they have enough support in the data. These improvements result in a flexible approach that improves the power in many gene-disease association scenarios while reducing the number of false positives reported.
