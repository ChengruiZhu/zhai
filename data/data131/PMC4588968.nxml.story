Of the 21 players, two players were injured mid-season and could not complete follow up. Two players were lost to follow-up. The average number of pitches thrown per player per game was 89±25 (range 30-161). The average games pitched was 12±5.7 (range 5-24). Supraspinatus (p<0.001), biceps (p<0.001), and external rotation strength in abduction and in neutral (p<0.001) decreased significantly post-game compared to pre-game regardless of the time of the season. Pain and fatigue were significantly higher post-game than pre-game (p<0.018) regardless of the time of the season. Pre-game VAS pain and fatigue at the end of the season correlated with the number games pitched during the season (r=0.66-0.73, p<0.006). There was an inverse linear relationship between games pitched and pre-game biceps, supraspinatus, and external rotation strength at the end of the season compared to beginning of season (r=-0.66-0.88, p<0.006). At the end of season compared to the beginning of season, there was a significant difference in pre-game pain, fatigue, biceps, supraspinatus, and external rotation strength between players who pitched more than 10 games versus players who pitched less than 10 games (p<0.033).
