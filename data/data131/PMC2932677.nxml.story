T lymphocytes play a key role in the regulation of the immune response in mammals. Various T-helper subtypes (Th1, Th2, Th17, Treg,â€¦) have been identified over the years, characterised by the expression of specific transcription factors and cytokines, which have a critical influence on the selection of different immune responses, driving pro-inflammatory or allergic responses, promoting alternative antibody classes, or preventing (auto)immunity by inhibiting the activation and proliferation of other cells. To gain insight into the heterogeneity and the plasticity of late T-helper lineages, we have built an integrated model of the regulatory network and signalling pathways controlling Th cell differentiation. Relying on a logical modelling framework, we have performed a systematic series of simulations to assess the effects of heterogeneous environments on Th cell differentiation. We have identified stable states corresponding to canonical Th1, Th2, Th17 and Treg subtypes, but also to hybrid cell types co-expressing combinations of Th1, Th2, Treg and Th17 markers in an environment-dependent fashion. Our analysis highlights the nature of these cell types and their relationships with canonical Th subtypes.
