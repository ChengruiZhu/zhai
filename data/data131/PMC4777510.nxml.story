Across the animal kingdom, chemical senses play a central role in guiding social behaviors by conveying information about particular behaviorally relevant traits. However, decoding these traits from profiles of chemical cues is challenging since cue levels are modulated by multiple factors. Here, we investigate how the mouse vomeronasal system, a chemosensory system important for processing social information, detects behaviorally relevant traits from natural stimuli. We focus on detection of a femaleâ€™s genetic background (a model for individuality) and estrus-state (a measure of sexual receptivity) by neurons in the first vomeronasal brain relay, the accessory olfactory bulb (AOB). We show that information about both genetic background and receptivity can be obtained from various stimulus sources: urine, vaginal secretions, and saliva. Importantly, while individual AOB neurons can only provide limited decoding ability of these traits, simple networks sampling AOB neuronal ensembles provide considerable improvement. Our analyses highlight an overlooked challenge associated with chemosensory processing and suggest how it can be overcome by downstream neurons that read information from multiple AOB neurons.
