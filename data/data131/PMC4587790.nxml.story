While it is known that the visual brain is immature at birth, there is little firm information about the developmental timeline of the visual system in humans. Despite this, it is commonly assumed that the cortex matures slowly, with primary visual areas developing first, followed by higher associative regions. Here we use fMRI in very young infants to show that this isnâ€™t the case. Adults are highly sensitive to moving objects, and to the spurious flow projected on their retinas while they move in the environment. Flow perception is mediated by an extensive network of areas involving primary and associative visual areas, but also vestibular associative cortices that mediate the perception of body motion (vection). Our data demonstrate that this complex network of higher associative areas is established and well developed by 7 wk of age, including the vestibular associative cortex. Interestingly, the maturation of the primary visual cortex lags behind the higher associative cortex; this suggests the existence of independent cortical inputs to the primary and the associative cortex at this stage of development, explaining why infants do not yet perceive motion with the same sensitivity as adults.
