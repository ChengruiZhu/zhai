Bromodomain containing 7 (BRD7) was identified as a nuclear transcriptional regulatory factor. BRD7 functions as a tumor suppressor in multiple cancers, including nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC). In this study, we reported a novel mechanism of BRD7 in NPC progression. We demonstrated that the expression of miR-141 was remarkably increased in NPC tissues and was negatively correlated with the expression of BRD7 and the survival rate of NPC patients. Decreased expression levels of miR-141, including the primary, the precursor and the mature forms of miR-141, were found in BRD7-overexpressing HEK293, 5-8F and HNE1 cells compared the control cells, while there was no obvious effect on the expression levels of the two critical enzymes Drosha and Dicer. BRD7 can negatively regulate the promoter activity of miR-141, while no obvious binding site of BRD7 was found in the potential promoter region of miR-141. Moreover, ectopic expression of miR-141 can significantly promote cell proliferation and inhibit apoptosis in NPC, and rescuing the expression of miR-141 in BRD7-overexpressing NPC cells could partially reverse the tumor suppressive effect of BRD7 on cell proliferation and tumor growth
