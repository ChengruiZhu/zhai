Overuse injuries are more common in the gymnastic sport. Repetitive microtrauma with thwarted repair might cause persistent injury in the tendon-bone junction. The anatomic factors (i.e malalignement) and overtraining predispose the athletes to overuse injuries most frequently. During adolescent growth spurt while the growth of long bones proceeds, the rectus femoris muscle, that cross more than one joint, might not gain flexibility enough and leads to excessive tensile stress on the iliac apophysis. Also, the gymnasts with generalized ligamentous laxity are more prone to the overuse injuries. Because lax ligaments fail to provide ligament stability and under further stress on the tissues neighbourhood of joint might cause overuse injuries. However, we were not able to find any difference between the athletes, who have groin pain and the ones have not, from the age, ligament laxity and hip rotation angles points of view. On the other hand, the high prevalence of groin pain complaint in the athletes, who perform rhythm gymnastic, might be related to the discipline specific exercises. So, the overuse injuries might be prevented by the well-planned training program in each particular discipline including strengthening and balance.
