Urogenital schistosomiasis is a tropical infectious disease caused by schistosome blood flukes, infecting more than 100 million people in sub-Saharan Africa. Protective immunity develops against schistosomes, but takes many years to do so, with children acquiring multiple infections with long-lived parasites. It is important to understand how this protection develops, both to aid vaccine development, and to understand the long-term implications of other control strategies which may reduce or alter natural exposure to the parasite. We used mathematical models to investigate possible explanations for this slow development of protection, including the possibility that when worms die (after surviving in the host for 3â€“10 years) they release large quantities of the molecules needed to stimulate a protective immune response, or the idea that an individual's infection burden needs to exceed a threshold number of parasites before they mount a protective immune response. We found that these mechanisms were consistent with patterns of levels of infection and antibody measured in populations with schistosome infection, but that neither was essential to explain these patterns. We found that the combination of the stage of the parasite life cycle which stimulated protective immunity, and the life cycle stage targeted by this immunity, was critical.
