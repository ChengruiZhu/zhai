Androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) is the mainstay palliative treatment for men with locally advanced and metastatic prostate cancer, and aims to reduce testosterone to levels obtained by surgical castration. Use of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) agonists predominates among the ADT options. The GnRH agonist, triptorelin is a first-line hormonal therapy that has demonstrated efficacy and safety in clinical trials of patients with locally advanced non-metastatic or metastatic disease. Sustained-release 1-, 3- and 6-month formulations of triptorelin, administered intramuscularly or subcutaneously, have been developed to provide improved flexibility and convenience for the patient. Head-to-head studies of GnRH agonists are lacking in the field of prostate cancer. Despite the inevitable progression to castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) in most patients receiving ADT, monitoring of testosterone levels needs to improve in routine practice and physicians should not overlook the benefits of continued ADT in their patients when introducing one of the various new treatment options for CRPC. For improved survival outcomes, there remains a need to tailor ADT treatment regimens, novel hormonal agents and chemotherapy according to the individual patient with advanced prostate cancer.
