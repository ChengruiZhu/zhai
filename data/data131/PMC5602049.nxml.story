Reproductive failure in humans is a very important social and economic problem, because nowadays women decide to conceive later in life and delay motherhood. Unfortunately, with increasing age they have less chance for natural fertilization and maintenance of pregnancy. Many of them need assisted reproductive technology. Approximately 10% of women after in vitro fertilization-embryo transfers experience recurrent implantation failure (RIF). Multiple factors may contribute to RIF, including oocyte and sperm quality, parental chromosomal anomalies, genetic or metabolic abnormalities of the embryo, poor uterine receptivity, immunological disturbances in the implantation site, and some gynecologic pathologies such as endometriosis, uterine fibroids, hydrosalpinx and endometrial polyps. Moreover, the procedure of in vitro fertilization itself could adversely influence the implantation. Nowadays, many studies are focused on the role of natural killer (NK) cells in normal and pathologic pregnancy because NK cells constitute the dominant cell population in the endometrium and they come in close contact with the allogeneic extravillous trophoblast cells in early pregnancy decidua. The majority of these cells are of CD56
