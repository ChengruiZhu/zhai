 mutants. Such strains may or may not be associated with fitness costs affecting their ability to transmit and cause disease. Resistant pathogens collected from treatment-na√Øve patients are strains for which fitness costs of resistance were not sufficient to prevent transmission. Those collected from treatment-experienced patients reflect strains that may or may not be associated with lower transmissibility. Determining which strains are sufficiently fit to be transmitted and cause disease can aid in developing effective strategies to combat the spread of resistance. Branching trees are graphical models used to infer the sequence of several binary events (i.e. a pathway) that have occurred in an unknown order. We propose a novel method using branching trees with prespecified components to compare evolutionary pathways among different populations. We apply our model to understand if there are unique drug-resistant pathways found only amongst treatment experienced patients that might reflect acquired resistant disease associated with fitness costs that limits its ability to transmit. Our methods can be generalized to any biological process for which the assumption of an ascending markov process applies.
