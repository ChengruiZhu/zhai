The hematopoietic system has provided a leading model for stem cell studies, and there is great interest in elucidating the mechanisms that control the decision of HSC self-renewal and differentiation. This switch is important for understanding hematopoietic diseases and manipulating HSCs for therapeutic purposes. However, because HSCs are currently unable to proliferate extensively in vitro, this severely limits the types of biochemical analyses that can be performed; and, consequently, the mechanisms that control the decision between early-stage HSC self-renewal and differentiation remain unclear. Murine bone marrow derived EML multipotential hematopoietic precursor cells are ideal for studying the switch. EML cells can grow in large culture and give rise to a mixture of self-renewing Lin-SCA+CD34+ cells and partially differentiated non-renewing Lin-SCA-CD34− cells in a cell autonomous fashion. Using RNA–Sequencing and ChIP–Sequencing, we identified and validated the HMG box protein TCF7 as a regulator in this switch and find that it operates in the absence of canonical Wnt signaling. Together with RUNX1, TCF7 regulates a network of transcription factors that characterize the CD34+ cell state. This work serves as a model for studying mechanisms of autonomous and balanced cell fate choice and is ultimately valuable for manipulating HSCs.
