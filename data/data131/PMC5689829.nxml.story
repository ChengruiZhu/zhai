Arrhythmias are electrical abnormalities of the heart that can degenerate into fibrillation, thus preventing normal heartbeats and leading to sudden cardiac death. The mechanisms leading to ventricular arrhythmias and the unexpected nature of sudden cardiac death are not fully understood. One hypothesis is that a group of cardiac myocytes, which generate contraction, spontaneously depolarize at precisely the same moment to excite the surrounding tissue. In individual myocytes, such misfires, known as delayed afterdepolarizations, are driven by random ion channel gating and thus stochastic in nature. While incidental afterdepolarizations in a large number of myocytes is highly improbable on any given beat, it may be feasible over a long time frame, thus explaining the unpredictability of arrhythmias. We developed a detailed model spanning the molecular, cellular, and tissue scales that realistically reproduces the mechanisms underlying this hypothesis. An efficient method is presented for estimating the probability of extremely rare delayed afterdepolarizations in tissue from a limited set of simulations. Furthermore, we demonstrate how altered tissue and ion channel properties in heart disease increase the risk of arrhythmia. This approach can be used generally to probe the effects of specific molecular mechanisms on the likelihood of rare delayed afterdepolarizations.
