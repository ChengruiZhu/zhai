Tissue factor (TF), the protease receptor initiating the coagulation system, functions in vascular development, angiogenesis, and tumor cell metastasis by poorly defined molecular mechanisms. We demonstrate that immobilized ligands for TF specifically support cell adhesion, migration, spreading, and intracellular signaling, which are not inhibited by RGD peptides. Two-hybrid screening identified actin-binding protein 280 (ABP-280) as ligand for the TF cytoplasmic domain. Extracellular ligation of TF is necessary for ABP-280 binding. ABP-280 recruitment to TF adhesion contacts is associated with reorganization of actin filaments, but cytoskeletal adaptor molecules typically found in integrin-mediated focal contacts are not associated with TF. Chimeric molecules of the TF cytoplasmic domain and an unrelated extracellular domain support cell spreading and migration, demonstrating that the extracellular domain of TF is not involved in the recruitment of accessory molecules that influence adhesive functions. Replacement of TF's cytoplasmic Ser residues with Asp to mimic phosphorylation enhances the interaction with ABP-280, whereas Ala mutations abolish coprecipitation of ABP-280 with immobilized TF cytoplasmic domain, and severely reduce cell spreading. The specific interaction of the TF cytoplasmic domain with ABP-280 provides a molecular pathway by which TF supports tumor cell metastasis and vascular remodeling.
