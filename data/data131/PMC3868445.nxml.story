This Account describes our biomimetic approaches to combining membrane adhesion with membrane transport, using both self-assembled “sticky” pores and “sticky” nanoparticles to trigger transit across membranes. This combination links both fundamental and applied research, acting as a bridge between molecular level assembly and the formation of functional biomaterials. The ultimate goal is to create complex self-assembled systems in biological or biomimetic environments that can both interface with cells and transport compounds across bilayers in response to remote chemical or electromagnetic signals. Our research in this area started with fundamental studies of intramembrane and intermembrane self-assembly, building upon previously known channel-forming compounds to create self-assembled channels that were switchable or able to mediate vesicle–vesicle adhesion. Subsequently, nanoparticles with a “sticky” coating were used to mediate adhesion between vesicles. Combining these adhesive properties with the unique characteristics of nanosized magnetite allowed a noninvasive magnetic signal to trigger transport of compounds out of magnetic nanoparticle-vesicle assemblies. Adding an extravesicular matrix produced new responsive biomaterials for use in tissue engineering. These biomaterials can be magnetically patterned and can deliver drugs upon receipt of a magnetic signal, allowing spatiotemporal control over cellular responses.
