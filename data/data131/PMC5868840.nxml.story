Our ability to temporarily retain sensory information is limited to a handful of items and is referred to as working memory capacity. Such memory capacity has been shown to vary across the general population, with some people retaining a higher number of items than others. An influential theory suggests that this individual capacity might be determined by the speed of slow brain waves (so-called theta waves) that range in frequency between four and seven cycles per second. It is hypothesized that these theta waves act as glue for items to be memorised such that the slower the theta waves, the higher the number of items that can be clustered and retained in memory. We tested this hypothesis by applying to human participants noninvasive current stimulation at slower or faster theta frequencies over a part of the brain that is involved in visuospatial working memory during a visuospatial task. In line with this influential theory, we found that stimulation at slower theta frequencies enhanced working memory capacity relative to stimulation at faster theta frequencies, which instead reduced working memory capacity. These effects were limited to visual items processed by the stimulated brain areas, confirming the importance of theta waves for the organization of visuospatial working memory.
