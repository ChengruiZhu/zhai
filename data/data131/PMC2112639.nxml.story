Antibodies directed against membrane components of dog pancreas rough endoplasmic reticulum (A-RER) and rat liver Golgi apparatus (A-Golgi) (Louvard, D., H. Reggio, and G. Warren, 1982, J. Cell Biol. 92:92-107) have been applied to cultured rat prolactin (PRL) cells, either normal cells in primary cultures, or clonal GH3 cells. In normal PRL cells, the A-RER stained the membranes of the perinuclear cisternae as well as those of many parallel RER cisternae. The A-Golgi stained part of the Golgi membranes. In the stacks it stained the medial saccules and, with a decreasing intensity, the saccules of the trans side, as well as, in some cells, a linear cisterna in the center of the Golgi zone. It also stained the membrane of many small vesicles as well as that of lysosomelike structures in all cells. In contrast, it never stained the secretory granule membrane, except at the level of very few segregating granules on the trans face of the Golgi zone. In GH3 cells the A-RER stained the membrane of the perinuclear cisternae, as well as that of short discontinuous flat cisternae. The A-Golgi stained the same components of the Golgi zone as in normal PRL cells. In some cells of both types the A-Golgi also stained discontinuous patches on the plasma membrane and small vesicles fusing with the plasma membrane. Immunostaining of Golgi membranes revealed modifications of membrane flow in relation to either acute stimulation of PRL release by thyroliberin or inhibition of basal secretion by monensin.
