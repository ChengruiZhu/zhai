Individuals with Fanconi anemia (FA) suffer from bone marrow failure and from elevated rates of haematological and solid malignancy. Moreover, FA patients exhibit extreme sensitivity to DNA interstrand cross-links (ICLs), but not other forms of DNA damage. Despite recent progress in identifying and characterising FA factors, little is known about the mechanistic basis of the ICL repair defect in FA. The identification and characterisation of FA–like pathways in simple model eukaryotes, amenable to genetic dissection, would clearly accelerate progress. Here, we have identified an ICL repair pathway in budding yeast that has significant similarities to the FA pathway and that acts in parallel to an established pathway controlled by the Pso2 exonuclease. We have discovered that a key component of this pathway, the FANCM-like helicase, Mph1, interacts and collaborates with a mismatch repair factor (MutSα) and a novel nuclear DNA repair factor Mgm101 to control ICL repair. We also found that a central role of these factors is to recruit Exonuclease 1 (Exo1) to ICL-damaged chromatin, and propose that this factor acts redundantly with Pso2 to execute the exonucleolytic processing of ICLs. Our findings reveal new mechanistic insights into the control of ICL repair by FA–like proteins in an important model organism.
