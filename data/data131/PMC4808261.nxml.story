Excessive acetabular anteversion is an important treatment consideration in hip preservation surgery. There is currently no reliable quantitative method for determining acetabular anteversion utilizing radiographs alone. The three main purposes of this study were to: (i) define and validate the neck axis distance (NAD) as a new visual and reproducible semi-quantitative radiographic parameter used to measure acetabular anteversion; (ii) determine the degree of correlation between NAD and computed tomography (CT)-measured acetabular anteversion; (iii) establish a sensitive and specific threshold value for NAD to identify excessive acetabular anteversion. This retrospective cohort study included all patients presenting to a single institution over a 14-month period who had undergone a dedicated musculoskeletal CT pelvis along with a standardized anteroposterior (AP) pelvis radiograph. Trained observers measured the NAD on the AP pelvis radiograph and equatorial acetabular anteversion on CT for all hips. Mixed model analysis was used to find prediction equations, and ROC analysis was used to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of NAD. NAD is a valid semi-quantitative predictor of acetabular anteversion and strongly correlates with CT-measured equatorial acetabular anteversion (
