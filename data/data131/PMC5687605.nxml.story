We performed immunofluorescent analysis of DNA hydroxymethylation and methylation in human testicular spermatogenic cells from azoospermic patients and ejaculated spermatozoa from sperm donors and patients from infertile couples. In contrast to methylation which was present throughout spermatogenesis, hydroxymethylation was either high or almost undetectable in both spermatogenic cells and ejaculated spermatozoa. On testicular cytogenetic preparations, 5-hydroxymethylcytosine was undetectable in mitotic and meiotic chromosomes, and was present exclusively in interphase spermatogonia Ad and in a minor spermatid population. The proportions of hydroxymethylated and non-hydroxymethylated diploid and haploid nuclei were similar among samples, suggesting that the observed alterations of 5-hydroxymethylcytosine patterns in differentiating spermatogenic cells are programmed. In ejaculates, a few spermatozoa had high 5-hydroxymethylcytosine level, while in the other ones hydroxymethylation was almost undetectable. The percentage of highly hydroxymethylated (5-hydroxymethylcytosine-positive) spermatozoa varied strongly among individuals. In patients from infertile couples, it was higher than in sperm donors (
