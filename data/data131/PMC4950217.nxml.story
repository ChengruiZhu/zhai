The aim of the study was to study the expression of hypoxia-inducible factor-1α (HIF-1α) and P-glycoprotein (P-gp) and analyze its correlation with human papillomavirus (HPV) infection. From January, 2012 to May, 2014, 72 cases of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) pathologic tissue samples were selected from the study group. Fifty-four lung benign lesions were selected to serve as the control group. HIF-1α and P-gp expression levels were detected using immunohistochemistry. PCR was used to detect the expression of HPV genome employing specific primers for HPV 16 and 18 types. The results showed that there was 47.2 and 63.9% positive HIF-1α and P-gp expression in the study group. No P-gp or HIF-1α expression was detected in the control group. The results established a positive correlation between the expression of HIF-1α and P-gp. In the study group, the expression and differentiation degree of HIF-1α was related to lymphatic metastasis. The HIF-1α expression in the well-differentiated samples was lower than that in the moderate or poorly differentiated samples. HIF-1α expression in patients with lymphatic metastasis was higher than in patients without metastasis. The expression rate of P-gp in adenocarcinoma was higher than that in squamous carcinoma. The detection rate of HPV DNA was 45.83 and 3.70% in the study and control groups, respectively. The HPV infection and differentiation degree had relevance to lymphatic metastasis in the study group. The HPV DNA detection rate in the well-differentiated samples was lower than that in the moderate or poorly differentiated samples. The HPV DNA detection rate in patients with lymphatic metastasis was higher than that in patients with no lymphatic metastasis. There was a close link between HIF-1α, P-gp expression and NSCLC occurrence, and the development of multidrug resistance. In conclusion, the detection of HIF-1α and P-gp expression can effectively predict drug resistance during chemotherapy in NSCLC, and these proteins can be used in drug prognosis.
