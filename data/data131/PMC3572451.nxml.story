Skin wounds comprise a serious medical issue for which few pharmacological interventions are available. Moreover, the inflammatory, angiogenic, and proliferative facets of a typical response to a wound each have broader relevance in other pathological conditions. Here we describe a genomics-driven approach to identify secreted proteins that modulate wound healing in a mouse ear punch model. We show that adiponectin, when injected into the wound edge, accelerates wound healing. Notably, adiponectin injection causes upregulation of keratin gene transcripts within hours of treatment, and subsequently promotes collagen organization, formation of pilosebaceous units, and proliferation of cells in the basal epithelial cell layer and pilosebaceous units of healing tissue. The globular domain of adiponectin is sufficient to mediate accelerated dorsal skin wound closure, and the effects are lost in mice that are homozygous null for the adiponectin receptor 1 gene. These findings extend recent observations of a protective role of adiponectin in other tissue injury settings, suggest modulation of AdipoR1 for the clinical management of wounds, and demonstrate a new approach to the identification of regulators of a wound healing response.
