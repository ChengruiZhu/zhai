One of the potential therapeutic methods of cancer treatment is the immunotherapy with monoclonal antibodies. This kind of therapy, although devoid of serious side effects, has often insufficient efficacy. The presence of complement inhibitors on the cancer cells, which are able to inactivate complement-mediated immune response represents one of the main reasons for the inefficiency of such therapy. In our studies we investigated the expression of main membraneâ€“bound and fluid-phase complement regulators: CD55, CD59 and factor H/factor H-like in tumour samples of ovarian and corpus uteri cancer. Tissue samples were collected from 50 patients and stained immunohistochemically, with the use of peroxidase-based immunodetection system. Immunohistochemical analysis revealed that complement inhibitors are present in examined tumors although their presence is heterogenous. The most prevalent is the presence of factor H/H-like, localized mostly in tumor stroma and within vascular structures. Membrane bound complement inhibitors are less prominently expressed by cancer cells. CD55 was detected in low percentage of cells, predominantly within cancer tubules. CD59 immunoreactivity was more prevalent in cancer cells, and was localized particularly at the margin of cancer cell tubules. Our results demonstrate that the most prominent complement inhibitor in cancer of ovary and corpus uteri origin is factor H/factor H-like. Blocking or downregulation of this inhibitor should be taken into consideration with regards to improving the efficiency of immunotherapy with monoclonal antibodies.
