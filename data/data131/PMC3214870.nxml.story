Epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG) is the most potent antioxidant polyphenol in green tea. In the present study, we investigated whether EGCG plays a role in the expression of transforming growth factor-beta1 (TGF-β1), protein kinase C (PKC) α/βII, and nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-κB) in glomerular epithelial cells (GECs) against high-glucose injury. Treatment with high glucose (30 mM) increased reactive oxygen species (ROS)/lipid peroxidation (LPO) and decreased glutathione (GSH) in GECs. Pretreatment with 100 µM EGCG attenuated the increase in ROS/LPO and restored the levels of GSH, whereas ROS, LPO, and GSH levels were not affected by treatment with 30 mM mannitol as an osmotic control. Interestingly, high-glucose treatment affected 3 separate signal transduction pathways in GECs. It increased the expression of TGF-β1, PKC α/βII, and NF-κB in GECs, respectively. EGCG (1, 10, 100 µM) pretreatment significantly decreased the expression of TGF-β1 induced by high glucose in a dose-dependent manner. In addition, EGCG (100 µM) inhibited the phosphorylation of PKC α/βII caused by glucose at 30 mM. Moreover, EGCG (1, 10, 100 µM) pretreatment significantly decreased the transcriptional activity of NF-κB induced by high glucose in a dose-dependent manner. These data suggest that EGCG could be a useful factor in modulating the injury to GECs caused by high glucose.
