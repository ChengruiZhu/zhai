We compared incidence rates of hospitalizations for all causes, and for congestive heart failure between users of fludrocortisone and users of midodrine in a retrospective cohort study of Tennessee Medicaid adult enrollees (1995–2009). Adjusted incidence rate ratios were calculated using negative binomial regression models. Subgroup analyses based on history of congestive heart failure were conducted. We studied 1324 patients initiating fludrocortisone and 797 patients initiating midodrine. Compared with fludrocortisone users, midodrine users had higher prevalence of cardiovascular conditions. Incidence rates of all‐cause hospitalizations for fludrocortisone and midodrine users were 1489 and 1330 per 1000 person‐years, respectively (adjusted incidence‐rate ratio 1.20, 95% confidence interval, 1.02–1.40). The respective rates of heart failure–related hospitalization were 76 and 84 per 1000 person‐years (adjusted incidence‐rate ratio: 1.33, 95% confidence interval, 0.79–2.56). Among patients with a history of congestive heart failure, the rates of all‐cause hospitalization for fludrocortisone and midodrine were 2448 and 1820 per 1000 person‐years (adjusted incidence‐rate ratio: 1.42, 95% confidence interval, 1.07–1.90), and the respective rates of heart failure exacerbation–related hospitalizations were 297 and 263 per 1000 person‐years (adjusted incidence‐rate ratio: 1.48, 95% confidence interval, 0.69–3.16).
