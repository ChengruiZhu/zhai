Coronary artery calcification (CAC) is highly prevalent in patients with coronary heart disease (CHD) and is associated with major adverse cardiovascular events. There are two recognized type of CACâ€”intimal and medial calcification, and each of them have specific risk factors. Several theories about the mechanism of vascular calcification have been put forward, and we currently believe that vascular calcification is an active, regulated process. CAC can usually be found in patients with severe CHD, and this asymptomatic phenomenon make early diagnosis of CAC important. Coronary computed tomographic angiography is the main noninvasive tool to detect calcified lesions. Measurement of coronary artery calcification by scoring is a reasonable metric for cardiovascular risk assessment in asymptomatic adults at intermediate risk. To date, effective medical treatment of CAC has not been identified. Several strategies of percutaneous coronary intervention have been applied to CHD patients with CAC, but with unsatisfactory results. Prognosis of CAC is still a major problem of CHD patients. Thus, more details about the mechanisms of CAC need to be elucidated in order to improve the understanding and treatment of CAC.
