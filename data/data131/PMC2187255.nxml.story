Crude preparations of interferon (IFN)-gamma derived from human peripheral blood leukocyte (PBL) cultures induced with 12-O-tetra- decanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA) and phytohemagglutinin (PHA) were more cytotoxic to HeLa cells than partially purified nautral or highly purified recombinant human IFN-gamma preparations. Conditioned media from PBL cultures contained, in addition to IFN-gamma, a mixture of cytotoxins, including classic lymphocyte-derived lymphotoxin (LT), and a TPA-induced cytotoxic activity produced by the adherent cell population (presumably monocytes). These two types of cytotoxins, indistinguishable in the mouse L929 cell LT assay, could be differentiated by an antiserum prepared against LT derived from the B lymphoblastoid cell line RPMI 1788. This antiserum neutralized lymphocyte-derived classic LT but failed to neutralize the activity of the monocyte-derived cytotoxin. Processing of conditioned media by sequential chromatography on silicic acid, Con A-Sepharose, and DEAE- Sephacel failed to separate IFN-gamma from the LT activity. However, this procedure did remove the monocyte-derived cytotoxic activity present in the original starting material, leaving predominantly classic LT. This LT showed a slightly basic isoelectric point (pI 7.6) which partially overlapped the more basic pI range of IFN-gamma. The two lymphokine activities also could not be completely separated by fast protein liquid chromatography or molecular sieve chromatography. LT in these partially purified preparations was associated with a protein having an apparent molecular weight of 58,000 on gel filtration. This form dissociated partially into a 20,000 mol wt species after denaturation with 0.1% NaDodSO4. IFN-gamma could be selectively removed from preparations containing both IFN-gamma and LT with the aid of monoclonal antibody to IFN-gamma. The addition of purified LT to purified E. coli-derived recombinant human IFN-gamma resulted in a marked synergistic enhancement of cytotoxicity for HeLa cells.
