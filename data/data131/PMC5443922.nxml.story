To define the clinical manifestations and laboratory characteristics of pediatric severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome (SFTS) case caused by a novel bunyavirus. we retrospectively analyzed a pediatric case of viral SFTS in a 13 year old successfully managed and confirmed to be due to the novel bunyavirus now referred to as Huaiyangshan virus. A literature review of related cases was performed.Our pediatric case was a 13.3-year-old middle school student no underlying disease. Major clinical features included a fever with chills, headache, and dizziness. The patient’s epidemiology showed he had close contact with his grandfather who had a confirmed, novel bunyavirus infection. Symptomatic theraphy were given at admission. The patient’s temperature and platelet count returned to normal by days 7 and 10, respectively, and he was discharged from the hospital with an improved condition. A literature search was performed using “severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome” and “bunyavirus” as keywords, but few relevant reports were found. Novel bunyavirus infection can be transmitted through close contact. Confirmed cases should be kept in isolation. Clinical manifestations were characterized by aspecific symptoms, such as fever and chills. In some cases, platelet counts may remain normal in the early phase of the disease, and fever may not present throughout the entire illness period. Thus, misdiagnosis is possible. Surveillance and vigorous follow-up should be carried out in children with tick bites or in close contact with an index patient in high-risk areas during peak season.
