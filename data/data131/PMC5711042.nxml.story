Intracavitary brachytherapy (ICBT) and interstitial brachytherapy (IB) techniques are commonly practiced for treating carcinoma of the cervix, either alone or in combination with external beam radiotherapy. Both these brachytherapy techniques have their own advantages and limitations in terms of tumor coverage and normal tissue sparing. Limited studies have been reported comparing the dosimetric features of these two techniques, especially from a single institution. We carried out a prospective clinical dosimetric comparison between ICBT and IB for patients treated at one center to bring out the inherent dosimetric features of these to two techniques. The study was carried out on 26 patients treated with ICBT and 55 with IB using CT‐based planning. Of the 55 patients treated with IB, 27 included tandem source loading (IBT) and 28 without the tandem loading (IBWT). The high‐dose volumes covered by 200% and 180% isodose surfaces were considerably larger in ICBT as compared to IB, whereas the treated volume was larger in IB as compared to ICBT. The bladder and rectal doses were the highest in ICBT and IBWT, respectively. The larger treated volume in IB as compared to ICBT was mainly because patients with larger tumor volumes were generally considered for IB. The results also indicated that in interstitial brachytherapy, better rectal sparing was achieved by including the tandem for treatment delivery.
