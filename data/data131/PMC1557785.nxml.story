In recent years, scientific efforts to find genes influencing disease and health-related traits have sought to capitalize on the unique genetic characteristics of admixed populations. Admixture can refer to the event of two or more genetically diverse populations intermating and producing an admixed population. Admixture creates the potential for efficient identification of trait-influencing genes. However, genetic association studies using admixed populations are also prone to incorrectly concluding that a gene is linked and associated with a trait even when it is not. Several researchers have produced promising statistical methodologies for genetic association studies within admixed populations. In this paper, the authors show how these statistical methods can be unified in a broadly applicable regression framework and discuss which variables should be included in the regression models for valid testing. Because the variables required in this regression framework can only be measured with error, the authors show the consequences of these measurement errors and present measurement error correction methods applicable to this problem. By recasting the statistical methods for genetic association studies within admixed populations as regression models, a broader range of modeling and hypothesis testing becomes available.
