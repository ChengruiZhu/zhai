Cell invasion is crucial for high mortality and recurrence rate in glioma. Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is an important step in cancer invasion. Metadherin (MTDH) contributes to EMT in several cancers, but the role and mechanism of MTDH in EMT-like process of glioma remain unknown. Here we demonstrate that MTDH was overexpressed in glioma tissues and cells and induced EMT-like change and invasion of glioma cells. Interestingly, MTDH could modulate the expression of a group of glioma-related miRNAs. In particular, MTDH upregulated miR-130b transcription via acting as a coactivator of NF-kB. MiR-130b promoted EMT-like change and invasion of glioma cells through targeting multiple EMT-related genes, including PTEN, PPP2CA and SMAD7. In addition, PTEN acted as the competing endogenous RNA (ceRNA) to affect PPP2CA and SMAD7 expression, and inhibited EMT-like change in glioma cells. Furthermore, miR-130b mediated EMT-like change induced by MTDH, and MTDH inhibited the expression levels of PTEN, PPP2CA and SMAD7. Taken together, we reveal a novel mechanism that MTDH induces EMT-like change and invasion of glioma via the regulation of miR-130b-ceRNAs, providing the first direct link between MTDH and miRNAs in cancer cells.
