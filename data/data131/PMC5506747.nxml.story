A 52-year-old woman presented with dyspnea and cough. Imaging studies showed an RUL mass with atelectasis. Bronchoscopy showed extrinsic compression of the RUL and middle lobe bronchi. Biopsy showed small cell lung cancer. Staging with positron emission tomography-computed tomography (CT) and contrast enhanced CT of brain showed no other disease. Following 4 cycles of platinum-based chemotherapy, CT imaging showed a decrease in tumor volume, but persistent RUL atelectasis. She agreed to participate in an institutional study to evaluate the use of CPAP to reduce respiratory motion and immobilize tumors during RT. During CPAP training, she complained of vertigo, headache, and weakness and refused simulation. The next day she reported less dyspnea and completed training and CT simulation without difficulty. CT simulation with CPAP showed reexpansion of the RUL. Lung volume increased from 2170 to 3767 mL (74 %). Gross tumor volume, clinical volume, and planning volume decreased 46%, 45%, and 38%, respectively. Mean lung dose and mean heart dose decreased 20% and 51%, respectively. CPAP was used daily for 1 hour before and during treatment. Cone beam CT scans showed that the RUL remained inflated throughout treatment.
