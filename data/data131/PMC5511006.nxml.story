Case 1: A 36-year-old Caucasian female with a past medical history (PMH) of HIV infection presented for evaluation of hematuria. Computed tomography (CT) without contrast showed pelvic venous congestion and narrowing of the extra-renal left renal vein (LRV). After the failure of conservative management, renal auto-transplantation was attempted but failed because of extensive venous collateral; the patient subsequently required a total hysterectomy due to recurrence of symptoms. Case 2: A 41-year-old Caucasian female with extensive PMH presented with chronic abdominal pain. A CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis showed pelvic venous congestion. The patient underwent angioplasty and stent placement of the LRV. Subsequently, a left ovarian vein embolization was performed. On follow-up visits, her symptoms improved. Case 3: A 36-year-old female with PMH of HIV infection, gastroesophageal reflux disease, and hypertension presented with hematuria and flank pain. Her venogram revealed 1 mm Hg pressure gradient across stenosis, suggestive of LRV hypertension. Over the months of her follow-up after discharge, her hematuria gradually decreased from daily to intermittent non-daily frequency, without any intervention.
