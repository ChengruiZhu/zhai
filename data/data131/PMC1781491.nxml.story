Animals typically have much smaller mitochondrial genomes than do nonanimal single-celled organisms and fungi. Whereas animal mitochondrial genomes are characterized by a tightly packed collection of conserved genes and other functional elements, the larger nonanimal mitochondrial genomes generally contain noncoding regions, such as introns and additional genes not present among animals. It has thus been argued that drastic mitochondrial size reduction occurred deep in evolutionary history, before the emergence of animals. In this study, however, we show that the phylum Placozoa, arguably one of the most ancient animal groups, possesses mitochondrial genomes of intermediate size, smaller than the typical nonanimal genome yet much larger than the mitochondrial genome found in typical animals. As in nonanimals, the increased size of the placozoan mitochondrial genome is due to the presence of additional genes, introns, and long noncoding regions. Although other large animal mitochondrial genomes have been discovered, they have been isolated findings in particular species and none encompassed as large a taxonomic group as the level of phylum. Because large mitochondrial genomes are a shared feature among all placozoans and given this phylum's phylogenetic position in the animal tree, we conclude that, contrary to conventional wisdom, the ancestral animal mitochondria was likely a large, noncompacted molecule.
