The aim of the present study was to monitor adverse drug reactions associated with antihypertensive drugs. The study was conducted in medicine out patient department of 150-bed Majeedia Hospital at Hamdard University Campus in New Delhi. The study was conducted by way of one to one patient interview by a registered pharmacist using a questionnaire-based Adverse Drug Reaction Monitoring Form drafted according to the World Health Organisation Monitoring Guidelines. A total of 34 adverse drug reactions were observed in 250 hypertensive patients during the four month study. A high percentage of adverse drug reactions occurred in middle aged and female patients. Of the 34 adverse drug reactions, 18 (52.9%) were mild, 14 (41.2%) moderate and only 2 (5.8%) were classified as severe. Combination therapy was associated with significantly high occurrence (P < 0.05) of adverse drug reactions, with a total of 21 (61.8%) as compared to monotherapy (n=13, 38.2%). Cardiovascular adverse drug reactions constituted a major component, followed by gastrointestinal and respiratory complaints. Beta-blockers were the drug category associated with majority of adverse drug reactions, followed by angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and calcium channel blockers. The above pharmacovigilance study presents the adverse drug reaction profile of antihypertensive medicines prescribed in our University Teaching Hospital. It was concluded that calcium channel blockers were the most frequently prescribed drug category but beta blockers were associated with higher frequency of adverse drug reactions.
