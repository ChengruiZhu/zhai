PubMed was used to search the following terms, separately and in combination: acne, acneiform eruption, chloracne, cutaneous adverse events, hepatocellular carcinoma, renal cell carcinoma, skin side effects, and sorafenib. Inclusion criteria for selecting papers to be reviewed included case reports and studies that described cutaneous and mucosal adverse side effects associated with sorafenib. All papers fulfilling inclusion criteria were reviewed and relevant manuscripts, along with their reference citations, were evaluated. Five patients—a woman with liver epithelioid hemangioendothelioma, three men with metastatic renal cell carcinoma, and a man with hepatocellular carcinoma—have developed sorafenib-associated facial acneiform eruption. The eruption typically occurred after 4 weeks of treatment at a dose of 400 mg twice daily. The lesions presented as either papules and pustules (2 patients) or, similar in appearance and distribution to chloracne, only open and closed comedones (3 patients). The sorafenib-associated facial acneiform eruption partially improved after initiating topical antibiotics, keratolytics, and/or retinoids; however, progressive improvement or resolution occurred after lowering the daily dose or discontinuation of sorafenib.
