The present study aimed to investigate the expression and association of the single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) -1637A/G in the promoter region of the T cell immunoglobulin domain and mucin domain protein-1 (Tim-1) gene in patients diagnosed with thymoma with or without myasthenia gravis (MG). The expression of Tim-1 was detected using the streptavidin peroxidase immunohistochemical staining method on tissues obtained from thymoma patients with (n=58) and without (n=62) MG. The Tim-1 gene -1637A/G polymorphism was detected using the single allele-specific primer polymerase chain reaction. The positive rate of Tim-1 expression in thymoma patients with MG was 62.1% (32/58), which was significantly higher compared with that in thymoma patients without MG (33.9%, 21/62) (P=0.002). The genotype frequencies of GG, GA and AA in the -1637A/G polymorphism were 0.7931, 0.2069 and 0, respectively, in thymoma patients with MG, and 0.6129, 0.3871 and 0, respectively, in thymoma patients without MG. A significant difference in the genotypes between the thymoma patients with MG and those without MG was found (P=0.031). In addition, a significant difference in allele frequencies between thymoma patients with MG and those without MG (P=0.024) was observed. The high expression of Tim-1 in thymoma tissues may play an important role in the development of thymoma with MG. The -1637A/G polymorphism site of the promoter region in Tim-1 may be associated with thymoma with MG. These findings provide a basis for further genetic research of thymoma with MG.
