AK+ -selective membrane conductance channel from rabbit sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) is studied in an artificial planar phospholipid bilayer. Membranes containing many such channels display voltage-dependent conductance, which is well described by a two-state conformational equilibrium with a free energy term linearly dependent on applied voltage. Pronase-derived alkaline proteinase b (APb), when added to the side of the membrane opposite to the SR vesicles (trans side), reduces the voltage dependence of the K+ conductance. Single-channel fluctuation experiments show that after APb treatment, the channel is still able to undergo transitions between its open and closed states, but that the probability of forming the open state is only slightly voltage-dependent. In terms of the conformational model, the enzyme's primary effect is to reduce the effective gating charge of the opening process by over 80%; a second effect of APb is to reduce the internal free energy of opening from +1.2 to +0.4 kcal/mol. The kinetics of APb action are strongly voltage-dependent, so as to indicate that the enzyme can react only with the channel's open state. The results imply that the channel contains a highly charged polypeptide region which moves in the direction perpendicular to the membrane plane when transitions between the open and closed states occur. A lysine or arginine residue in this region becomes exposed to the trans aqueous solution when the channel is in its open conformation.
