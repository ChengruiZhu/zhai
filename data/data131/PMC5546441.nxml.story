Cell apoptosis often induces inflammation and injury in the liver, with endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress as the most possible reason. Resveratrol (RSV) has been shown to prevent hepatic steatosis and alleviate apoptosis, however, the exact mechanisms underlying the effects still need to be explored. Here we co-cultured HepG2 cells with free fatty acid (FFA) solution (oleic acid: palmitic acid = 2:1) and then exposed to a carbon tetrachloride (CCl4) solution to induce apoptosis. To evaluate the therapeutic effects, RSV (2.5 μM, 5 μM, 10 μM) was added to the cells. Results showed that HepG2 cells co-cultured with FFA exhibited lipid infiltration and were susceptible to apoptosis upon exposure to the CCl4 solution. The expression of molecules related to apoptosis (Caspases, Bcl-2/Bax) and ER stress (GRP78, IRE1, ATF6, PERK, et al.) was all significantly decreased upon RSV treatment. We further inhibited GRP78 by siRNA, results showed that the anti-apoptotic effect of RSV still maintained under GRP78 siRNA condition. Our data demonstrated that lipid accumulated HepG2 cells were susceptible to injury, and RSV could improve apoptosis in FFA and CCl4 stressed cells, which partially via restoring ER function.
