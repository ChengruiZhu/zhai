Transretinal current pulses flowing from the receptor side to the vitreous side of the retina cause transient release of transmitter from the photoreceptor terminals, and in off-center bipolar cells they evoke transient depolarizations with a brief (less than 1 ms) synaptic delay. Since it is known that the presence of Na+ in the external medium is not essential for this type of transmitter release, we used this procedure to examine the role of [Na+]o in the generation of light- evoked responses (hyperpolarizing to spot illumination in the receptive field center and depolarizing to an annulus in the surround) of this type of bipolar cell. When the cell membrane was steadily depolarized by current injection through the recording microelectrode, the depolarizing response evoked by the transretinal current pulses decreased in amplitude and reversed its polarity at above +45 mV. Conversely, the response amplitude increased when the cell was steadily hyperpolarized. The reversal potential seems to be lowered in low [Na+]o (28 mM). Removal of Na+ from the superfusate hyperpolarized the cell and both the light-evoked and current-evoked responses disappeared. From these observations, it is hypothesized that the hyperpolarizing center response of the off-center bipolar cells is a result of removal of sustained depolarization produced by sodium permeability increase.
