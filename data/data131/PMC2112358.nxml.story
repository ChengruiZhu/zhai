Specific binding (conjugation) of cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL) to target cells (TC) is the first step in a multistage process ultimately resulting in dissolution of the TC and recycling of the CTL. We examined the position of the microtubule organizing center (MTOC) of immune CTL bound to specific TC. Immunofluorescence labeling of freshly prepared CTL-TC conjugates with tubulin antibodies indicated that the MTOC in essentially all conjugated CTL but not in the conjugated TC were oriented towards the intercellular contact site. This finding was corroborated by electron microscopy examination of CTL-TC conjugates fixed either immediately after conjugation or during the lytic process. Antibody-induced caps of membrane antigens of CTL such as H-2 and Thy 1, did not show a similar relationship to the MTOC. Incubation of CTL- TC conjugates, 10-15 min at room temperature, resulted in an apparent deterioration of the microtubular system of conjugated CTL. It is proposed that the CTL plasma membrane proximal to the MTOC is particularly active in forming stable intercellular contacts, resulting in CTL-TC conjugation, and that subsequent modulation of the microtubular system of the CTL may be related to the cytolytic response and to detachment of the effector cell.
