Bortezomib-based regimens have significant activities in multiple myeloma (MM). In this study, we tested the efficacy of a total therapy with a staged approach where newly diagnosed MM patients received vincristine/adriamycin/dexamethsone (VAD). VAD-sensitive patients (≥75% paraprotein reduction) received autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (auto-HSCT), whereas less VAD-sensitive patients (<75% paraprotein reduction) received bortezomib/thalidomide/dexamethasone (VTD) for further cytoreduction prior to auto-HSCT. On an intention-to-treat analysis, a progressive increase of complete remission (CR) rates was observed, with cumulative CR rates of 48% after HSCT. Seven patients progressed leading to three fatalities, of which two had central nervous system disease. The 3-year overall survival and event-free survival were 75.1% and 48.3%, respectively. Six patients developed oligoclonal reconstitution with new paraproteins. In the absence of anticoagulant prophylaxis, no patients developed deep vein thrombosis. The staged application of VAD+/–VTD/auto-HSCT resulted in an appreciable response rate and promising survivals. Our approach reduced the use of bortezomib without compromising the ultimate CR rate and is of financial significance for less affluent communities.
