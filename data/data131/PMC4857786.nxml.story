Zoophytophagy is common among predacious arthropods, but research on their role in plant-herbivore interactions is generally focused on predation effects whereas their phytophagy is largely neglected. Our recent study revealed the ability of zoophytophagous predators to induce defense related traits and to affect herbivore performance apart from predation through the plant. Additionally, we show here that predator-exposed plants suffer less damage compared to unexposed plants. Thus, zoophytophagous organisms likely shape community structure by both their predation on herbivores and their phytophagy. Here, we consider zoophytophagous predators as plant vaccination factors and outline how their dual role in affecting herbivores may impact their use in biological pest control. Because plant responses to phytophagy and phytopathogens are known to interact, zoophytophagous predators may also affect plant-pathogen interactions. When we consider these indirect interactions with different plant pest organisms, we will likely better understand the ecology of the complex relationships among plants, herbivores and predators. Moreover, a comprehensive knowledge on the effects of the phytophagy of predators in these ecological interactions will potentially allow us to enhance sustainability in pest control.
