Twenty protocols were included from 155 U.S. academic orthopaedic programs for a total of 30 protocols. Only one protocol (5%) recommended a pre-operative rehabilitation program and no protocol recommended continuous passive motion post-operatively. Twenty-six protocols (86.6%) recommended immediate post-operative bracing with an average 5.0 (range 3 to 8) weeks of brace use. Twenty-three of these protocols (88.5%) specifically mentioned locking of the brace during ambulation. Twelve (40.0%) protocols permitted immediate weight bearing as tolerated (WBAT) post-operatively, while the remaining protocols permitted WBAT at an average 4.0 (range 1 to 7) weeks post-operatively. There was considerable variation in range of motion (ROM) goals with most protocols (73.3%) initiating immediate PROM to 90Â°. Full ROM was mentioned in 22 (73.3%) protocols and permitted at an average of 5.2 (range 1 to 7) weeks. The types of strength and proprioception exercises specifically recommended in each protocol were extremely diverse. In regard to modalities recommended for return to basic activity, stationary biking was the most commonly employed (90.0%) at an average 4.6 (range 1 to 7) weeks post-operatively. Agility and pivot training were permitted at an average of 12.5 (range 7 to 28) and 19.3 (range 11 to 28) weeks, respectively. Only five protocols (16.7%) employed functional testing during the rehabilitation process as a marker for return to athletic activities, with 14 (46.7%) protocols failing to mention return to practice or competition as a goal for meniscal repair rehabilitation.
