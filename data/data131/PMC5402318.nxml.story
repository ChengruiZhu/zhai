. bone marrow aspirate concentrate, BMAC) or bone graft, is a common treatment alternative. In the post-collapse phase, THA (total hip arthroplasty) must be performed in most of the patients. In addition to surgical treatment, the intravenous application of Iloprost has been shown to have a curative potential and analgesic effect. From October 2009 to October 2014, 49 patients with AVN (stages I-III) were treated with core decompression at our institution. All patients were divided into group A (CD + BMAC) and group B (CD alone). Of these patients, 20 were included in a matched pair analysis. The patients were matched to age, gender, ARCO-stage, Kerboul combined necrotic angle, the cause of AVN, and whether Iloprost-therapy was performed. The Merle d’Aubigné Score and the Kerboul combined necrotic angle in a-p and lateral radiographs were evaluated pre- and postoperatively. The primary endpoint was a total hip arthroplasty. In group A, two patients needed THA while in group B four patients were treated with THA. In group A, the Merle d’Aubigné Score improved from 13.5 (pre-operatively) to 15.3 (postoperatively). In group B there was no difference between the pre- (14.3) and postoperative (14.1) assessment. The mean of the Kerboul angle showed no difference in both groups compared pre- to postoperatively (group A: pre-op 212°, postop 220°, group B: pre-op 213, postop 222°). Regarding radiographic evaluation, the interobserver variability revealed a moderate agreement between two raters regarding the pre-(ICC 0.594) and postoperative analysis (ICC 0.604).This study demonstrates that CD in combination with the application of autologous bone marrow aspirate concentrate into the femoral head seems to be a safe and efficient treatment alternative in the early stages of AVN of the femoral head when compared to CD alone.
