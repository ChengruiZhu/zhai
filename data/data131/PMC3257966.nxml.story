The aim of the present study was to investigate the effects of anabolic-androgenic steroids and resistance training (RT) on insulin sensitivity in ovariectomized rats. Adult female Wistar rats were divided into ten experimental groups (n = 5 animals per group): (1) sedentary (Sed-Intact); (2) sedentary ovariectomized (Sed-Ovx); (3) sedentary nandrolone (Sed-Intact-ND); (4) sedentary ovariectomized plus nandrolone (Sed-Ovx-ND); (5) trained (TR-Intact); (6) trained nandrolone (TR-Intact-ND); (7) trained ovariectomized (TR-Ovx); (8) trained ovariectomized plus nandrolone; (9) trained sham; and (10) trained ovariectomized plus sham. Four sessions of RT were used, during which the animals climbed a 1.1 m vertical ladder with weights attached to their tails. The sessions were performed once every 3 days, with between four and nine climbs and with eight to twelve dynamic movements per climb. To test the sensitivity of insulin in the pancreas, glucose and insulin tolerance tests were performed. For insulin sensitivity, there was a statistically significant interaction for the TR-Ovx group, which presented higher sensitivity than the Sed-Intact, Sed-Ovx, and TR-Intact groups. Sed-Intact-ND and TR-Intact-ND groups exhibited higher values of insulin sensitivity than the Sed-Intact group. Except for the TR-Intact group, sensitivity was greater in trained groups than in the Sed-Intact group. There was higher insulin sensitivity in the TR-Intact-ND group than in the Sed-Intact and Sed-Intact-ND groups (
