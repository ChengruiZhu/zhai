The present study aimed to observe the methylation status of the CpG islands at the human hedgehog interacting protein (HHIP) gene in gastric cancer tissues, peritumoral tissues and the AGS cell line, to analyze the association between the methylation status of the CpG islands and the tumorigenesis of gastric cancer. The HHIP mRNA expression in 60 human gastric carcinnoma tissues, peritumoral tissues and the gastric carcinoma AGS cell line were detected by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). The HHIP methylation status of the promoter region in the gastric carcinnoma tissues and peritumoral tissues was detected by methylation-specific PCR (MSP). Prior to and following treatment with methyl transferase inhibitor 5-aza-2′-deoxycitydine (5-aza-dc), the HHIP mRNA expression level, the methylation status of the promoter region and the methylation site loci on the CpG islands in the AGS cells were detected by RT-PCR, MSP and bisulfite sequencing PCR (BSP), respectively. The correlation between the methylation status of the CpG islands at the HHIP promoter region and the HHIP mRNA expression level were analyzed. It was found that the expression level of the HHIP mRNA in the gastric carcinoma tissues was significantly lower than that in the adjacent tissues (0.82±0.38 vs. 1.60±0.26, respectively; P<0.001). No significant correlations were observed between the expression of HHIP mRNA and age, gender, tumor-node-metastasis stage, differentiation degree and presence of lymph node metastasis (P>0.05). The degree of methylation of the HHIP gene promotor in the peritumoral tissues (17.7±3.59%) was significantly lower than that in the gastric cancer tissues (62.9±6.14%) and in the AGS cells (99.7±0.67%) (P<0.05). Compared with prior to 5-aza-dc intervention, the HHIP mRNA expression level in the AGS cells was significantly increased subsequent to intervention (0.21±0.12 vs. 4.68±0.22; P<0.01), while the degree of methylation in the AGS cells was significantly decreased (90.2±0.67 vs. 10.1±0.21%; P<0.01), and the methylation sites in CpG islands were significantly reduced. The degree of HHIP methylation showed a negative correlation with the level of mRNA expression (r=−0.693; P<0.01). It can be hypothesized that a high degree of methylation of the HHIP gene promoter CpG islands in gastric cancer tissues and cells causes a decrease in HHIP mRNA expression, which may be involved in the carcinogenesis of gastric cancer.
