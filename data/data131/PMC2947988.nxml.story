Oscillations of the electrical field in the brain at 30–80 Hz (gamma oscillations) reflect coordinated firing of neurons during cognitive, sensory, and motor activity, and are thought to be a key phenomenon in the organization of neural processing in the cortex. Synchronous firing of a particular type of neuron, the inhibitory fast-spiking (FS) cell, imposes the gamma rhythm on other cells in the network. FS cells are highly interconnected by both gap junctions and chemical inhibition. In this study, we probed FS cells with a synthetic conductance stimulus which mimics the electrical effect of these complex connections in a controlled way, and directly measured how the timing of their firing should be affected by nearby FS neighbours. We were able to fit a mathematically simple but accurate model to these measurements, the “synaptic phase-resetting function”, which predicts how FS neurons synchronize at different frequencies, noise levels, and synaptic connection strengths. This model gives us deeper insight into how the FS cells synchronize so effectively at gamma oscillations, and will be a building-block in large-scale simulations of the FS cell network aimed at understanding the onset and stability of patterns of gamma oscillation in the cortex.
