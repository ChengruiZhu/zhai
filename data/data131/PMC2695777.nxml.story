Salicylic acid and enhanced disease susceptibility 1 are important components of resistance gene-mediated defense signaling against diverse pathogens in a variety of plants. Present understanding of plant defense signaling pathways places salicylic acid and enhanced disease susceptibility 1 downstream of resistant protein activation. In addition, enhanced disease susceptibility 1 is primarily thought to function in the signaling initiated via Toll-interleukin 1-receptor type of resistance proteins. Here, we show that salicylic acid and enhanced disease susceptibility 1 serve redundant functions in defense signaling mediated by coiled-coil-domain containing resistance proteins that were thought to function independent of enhanced disease susceptibility 1. Furthermore, resistance signaling induced under low oleic acid conditions also requires enhanced disease susceptibility 1 and salicylic acid in a redundant manner, but these components are required upstream of resistance gene expression. Together, these results show that the functional redundancy between salicylic acid and enhanced disease susceptibility 1 has precluded their detection as required components of many resistance proteinâ€“signaling pathways.
