This 6-week, multicenter, randomized withdrawal, placebo-controlled trial sought to determine whether symptoms of physical dependence occur after abrupt cessation of pomaglumetad methionil (LY2140023 monohydrate), a metabotropic glutamate 2/3 receptor agonist, in patients with schizophrenia. Eligible outpatients, 18 to 65 years old who required a modification or initiation of antipsychotic medication received 4 weeks of pomaglumetad methionil during open-label treatment and then were randomized, double-blind, to continue pomaglumetad methionil or receive placebo for 2 weeks. The primary outcome compared results of the 3-day moving mean of the total score on the Discontinuation Symptom Checklist-Modified Rickels for pomaglumetad methionil-treated patients with those on placebo during the randomized withdrawal phase. An electronic patient-reported outcome (ePRO) device was used daily to record these results. During the withdrawal phase, 103 patients were randomized, and 98 patients completed the trial. There was no statistically significant evidence of withdrawal symptoms associated with placebo compared with pomaglumetad methionil continuation as measured by Discontinuation Symptom Checklist-Modified Rickels (
