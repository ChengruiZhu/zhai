The calcium release channel (CRC) from skeletal muscle is an unusually large tetrameric ion channel of the sarcoplasmic reticulum, and it is a major component of the triad junction, the site of excitation contraction coupling. The three-dimensional architecture of the CRC was determined from a random conical tilt series of images extracted from electron micrographs of isolated detergent-solubilized channels prepared in a frozen-hydrated state. Three major classes of fourfold symmetric images were identified, and three-dimensional reconstructions were determined for two of these. The two independent reconstructions were almost identical, being related to each other by a 180 degrees rotation about an axis in the plane of the specimen grid. The CRC consists of a large cytoplasmic assembly (29 x 29 x 12 nm) and a smaller transmembrane assembly that protrudes 7 nm from one of its faces. A cylindrical low-density region, 2-3 nm in apparent diameter, extends down the center of the transmembrane assembly, and possibly corresponds to the transmembrane Ca(2+)-conducting pathway. At its cytoplasmic end this channel-like feature appears to be plugged by a globular mass of density. The cytoplasmic assembly is apparently constructed from 10 or more domains that are loosely packed together such that greater than 50% of the volume enveloped by the assembly is occupied by solvent. The cytoplasmic assembly is suggestive of a scaffolding and seems well adapted to maintain the structural integrity of the triad junction while allowing ions to freely diffuse to and away from the transmembrane assembly.
