Swirling dance-like patterns of cellular motion accompany the formation of a vital embryonic structure in birds and mammals called the primitive streak, which is located where the future vertebral column will form. The primitive streak is considered the “organizing center” of the embryo, because during early embryonic life the cells in the top-most tissue layer move through the streak and generate the middle and bottom-most embryonic tissue layers, in a process called gastrulation. Despite the extreme importance of gastrulation, the mechanics driving the formation of the primitive streak are not well understood. Here, we use time-lapse microscopy in living embryos to study cellular motion, as well as the motion of the connective tissue fibers, beneath the cells. We show for the first time that the nonliving connective tissue fibers do not form a static scaffold over which cells move—indeed, the fibers are engaged in the same “dance” as the upper layer of cells. Our “composite motion” movies (cell + fibers) advance understanding of how embryos organize their shape during a critical period that a famous developmental biologist, Louis Wolpert, called “The most important day of your life.”
