 Portions of mink endometrium in delayed implantation, early postimplantation, and pseudo pregnancy were fixed in buffered osmium tetroxide with sucrose, or potassium permanganate. After rapid dehydration the portions of endometrium were embedded in either methacrylate or epoxy resin. Examination of the cells from the body of the glands of the endometrium of delayed implantation revealed the presence of prominent terminal bars, numerous secretion granules, and membrane discs in the apical region of the cell. In the supranuclear and infranuclear regions, mildly dilated cisternae of the endoplasmic reticulum were present, and in many cells unusually large mitochondria were seen. Numerous changes were noted in the gland cells of the post implantation stage. The endoplasmic reticulum in the basal region was extensively dilated, and the nuclei were situated more centrally. Giant mitochondria were no longer present. The large secretion granules were not present, but smaller granules were seen, especially in the Golgi region. Some of the Golgi cisternae were dilated and the pattern of parallel membranes was consequently less distinct. It is suggested that gland cells in the postimplantation and pseudopregnancy stages exhibit evidence of greater secretory activity than those in the delayed implantation stage.
