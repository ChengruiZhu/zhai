Women with breast cancer receive support from their partners to deal with the side effects of therapies over the cancer trajectory. Hormonal therapy (HT) is usually given after completing other treatments, and women receiving HT reclaim their normal life. This may lead to changes in support from their partners. Therefore, we explored women's perceptions of the support provided by their male partners in managing the side effects of adjuvant HT. We conducted semi-structured interviews with 10 women who received HT and recognized their partners as a main source of support. An interview guide was used to explore their experiences of treatment side effects, the contents of support received from their partners, their need for support, and their overall relationship with their partners. Interviews were analysed by content analysis. A theme on how participants perceived support from their partners was formulated as “Support not corresponding to transition to a new treatment” with the following categories: “Shrinking support,” “Primacy of partner,” and “Solitary new treatment.” Participants felt lack of support from their partners because their partners did not understand their experience of the side effects induced by HT. Unlike the side effects of past treatments such as surgery and chemotherapy, side effects of HT cannot be observed and are highly subjective. Their partners often failed to notice these symptoms and provided little support. Nevertheless, participants aimed to accept the existing support without asking for more. They were left alone in the continuing trajectory of breast cancer. After starting HT, women entered a new treatment phase in which less understanding and support was provided by partners. Educational support for couples may enable sharing of subjective symptoms that are not obvious to partners and improve outcomes by facilitating partner engagement and support.
