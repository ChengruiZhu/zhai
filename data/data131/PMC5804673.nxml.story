IL-1 cytokines are mainly responsible for controlling a series of pro-inflammatory reactions induced in response to pathogen mediated tissue injury. Among the IL-1 cytokine family, IL-1 β results in upregulation of genes responsible for boosting immune system reactivity and inflammatory response. With growing pathophysiological relevance of IL-1β in a myriad of disease pathogenesis, new biological drugs have been developed in recent years. One such drug, Canakinumab, targeting IL-1β has been recently approved for clinical use. The recent results from the CANTOS (Canakinumab Anti-Inflammatory Thrombosis Outcome Study) trial are encouraging in this aspect. The results suggest that anti-inflammatory therapy using canakinumab at a dose of 150 mg every 3 months led to significantly lower recurrent cardiovascular events than the placebo drug. These results were independent of lipid-lowering effects of these drugs. If the results are widely applicable, the CANTOS trial would reaffirm the hypothesis of atherothrombosis due to inflammation, hence supporting the need for a cytokine-based therapy for the secondary prevention of cardiovascular diseases. Moreover, the potential benefits of the phenomenal reduction in the inflammatory cascade induced by canakinumab should be carefully balanced against its long-term safety profile which is yet unknown. However, the inflammatory hypothesis of atherothrombosis supports a cytokine-based therapy for the secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease. Furthermore, the potential benefits from the reduction in inflammatory markers induced by canakinumab should be carefully balanced against its unknown long-term safety profile.
