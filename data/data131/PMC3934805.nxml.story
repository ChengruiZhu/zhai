In the present study, we report an extremely rare case of a 31-year-old woman with neuroblastoma arising in an ovarian cystic teratoma. We analyzed the expression of activating receptors on natural killer (NK) cells derived from the patient's peripheral blood and peritoneal fluid. In addition, we investigated the presence of specific ligands recognized by different NK cell receptors on tumor cells. We show that NK cells isolated from peritoneal fluid expressed certain triggering receptors including DNAM-1 (CD226) and CD16 with lower intensity as compared to peripheral blood NK cells. Remarkably, at variance with most cases of childhood neuroblastoma, the tumor cells from this patient expressed substantial amounts of HLA class-I molecules. These molecules are known to be protective against NK cell-mediated lysis. In addition, neuroblastoma cells expressed B7-H3 (CD276), another surface molecule that inhibits NK cell function. Finally, this tumor did not express the PVR (CD155) and nectin-2 (CD112) ligands for the DNAM-1 activating NK receptor, which plays a crucial role in NK/neuroblastoma interactions. Altogether, these findings indicate that the neuroblastoma cells of this patient express an NK-resistant surface phenotype, which is at least in part similar to that previously described in a fraction of childhood neuroblastoma.
