The morphometric analysis of growing cells shows that the membranes of the digestive apparatus have a surface area equal to the cell surface area. After yeast phagocytosis, the surface area of the membrane surrounding the ingested yeast is equal to 40% of the surface area of the cell membrane. In spite of this internalization, the cell surface remains constant. Its renewal is insured by the translocation of the membrane of the digestive system, the surface area that concomitantly decreases by 40%. This means that the influx of plasma membrane is continually compensated for by the same outflow of internal membranes. During this turnover, the characteristic polysaccharide stainability (two different stains were used) of the plasma membrane is maintained after internalization, at the level of the digestive system, despite the presence of hydrolases in the digestive vacuoles. The cytochemical demonstration of acid phosphatase shows that this enzyme penetrates into phagosomes by fusion between phagosomes and vacloles of various sizes. The debris of digested yeast are released into the culture medium after 2 h. This process of defecation is accompanied by the appearance of new pinocytotic vacuoles, which indicates that the uptake of axenic medium has resumed. A model of membrane turnover is proposed to explain these observations.
