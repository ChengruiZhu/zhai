Between 2009–2011, 165 (all previously healthy) toddlers were (Males = 58 %, females = 42 %) and had normal weights in 70 %. Witnessed incidents were in 85 %. Two control groups [Medication (control) = 72, Chemical (control) = 48] directly visited the facility after incident, while two intervention groups [Medication (intervention) = 27, Chemical (intervention) = 18] received orally administered water, salt/sugar solutes, milk/yogurt, lemon juice and/or manually induced vomiting before the visit. Abnormal clinical outcomes in total were in vital signs = 15 %, physical examination = 42 % and diagnostic tests = 26 %; hospital outcomes were admission = 16 %, length of stay range (2 hours–7.5 days), cost range (667–11,500). Bivariate analysis: Length of stay in Medication (intervention) = 9[5.4–12.0] hours significantly higher than Medication (control) = 5[2.7–7.5] hours, p = 0.003; abnormal physical examination in Chemical (intervention) = 77.8 % significantly higher than Chemical (control) = 37.5 %, p = 0.004. In regression: intervention significantly increased length of stay (t = 0.213, adj. P = 0.035); lower weight toddlers were at higher risk of admission (Beta = -0.51, adj. P = 0.018); delayed arrival time significantly increased abnormal physical examination (Beta = 0.29, adj. P = 0.003). No significant control/intervention group differences regarding abnormal vital signs (adj. P = 0.148), physical examination (adj. P = 0.781), diagnostic tests (adj. P = 0.285), admission (adj. P = 0.499), and cost (adj. P = 0.102).
