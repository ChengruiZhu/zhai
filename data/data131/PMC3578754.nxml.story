Infection with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) currently cannot be cured. It can however be contained through treatment with a combination of several anti-viral drugs. Yet, during treatment resistance can occur which leads to drugs becoming ineffective. Through a combination of drugs, this resistance can be deferred indefinitely. The optimal combination of drugs depends on the specific strain of HIV with which the patient is infected. Previously, methods have been developed that predict a personalized treatment regimen based on the genetic sequence (genotype) of the virus via the use of computer modeling, corner stone of the methods is drug affinity prediction. Here we have applied proteochemometric modeling which takes this genetic information into account, but also includes chemical description of the drugs that are now clinically available. We show that this combined technique performs better than models that only include genetic information. Our approach leads to personalized treatment predictions with a higher reliability compared to the current state of the art. In addition, we include a reliability measure which allows each prediction to be assessed for reliability. Finally we describe mutations of the HIV genome that were not previously described in literature and lead to resistance to treatment.
