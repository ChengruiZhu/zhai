Alternative splicing is the process by which cells express a set of different, but related, transcripts from a single gene. When translated, each transcript results in a different protein, resulting in additional cellular complexity. Affymetrix Exon microarrays, which feature multiple probesets targeting different locations throughout each gene, allow the changes in transcription that result from alternative splicing to be investigated in a single genome-wide assay. In addition, the increased number of probesets targeting each gene offers the potential to combine signals in order to increase statistical power, allowing smaller changes to be detected reliably. We developed a novel algorithm to exploit both these aspects of exon arrays and applied it to tumour hypoxia in clinical samples. Our method identified 4 potential transcript variants upregulated in hypoxic cancers, including a splice variant of the Laminin alpha 3 gene, which we were then able to validate by other methods. On further investigation, we found that expression of this particular isoform in head and neck cancers was a strong adverse prognostic factor for survival following primary surgical treatment. This shows that exon arrays can be used to identify clinically relevant splicing events with potential utility as prognostic biomarkers.
