Changes in the expression of the Notch1 intracellular domain (NICD) and p21 proteins have been shown to be closely associated with the development and progression of a number of cancers. The present study aimed to investigate the expression levels of the two proteins in gastric carcinoma and precancerous lesions, and to determine the clinical significance of this. A total of 109 gastric cancer, 57 precancerous gastric lesion, 50 chronic superficial gastritis and 17 normal gastric mucosa patients were recruited for immunohistochemical staining of NICD and p21 protein expression. The protein expression levels in the gastric cancer patient samples were associated with the clinicopathological and survival data. NICD protein levels were upregulated gradually from normal gastric mucosae through chronic superficial gastritis and precancerous gastric lesions to gastric cancer tissues (P<0.01), whereas p21 protein levels were downregulated accordingly (P<0.01). Increased NICD and a loss of p21 expression were closely associated with tumor dedifferentiation, depth of tumor invasion, lymph node metastasis, surface morphology and Lauren classification in gastric cancer. Thus, NICD expression was inversely associated with p21 expression. In addition, the overall survival rate was greater in NICD
