This review presents scientific findings concerning the use of bioactive nanocomposites in the field of tissue repair and regeneration. Bioactivity is the ability of a material to incite a specific biological reaction, usually at the boundary of the material. Nanocomposites have been shown to be ideal bioactive materials due the many biological interfaces and structures operating at the nanoscale. This has resulted in many researchers investigating nanocomposites for use in bioapplications. Nanocomposites encompass a number of different structures, incorporating organic-inorganic, inorganic-inorganic and bioinorganic nanomaterials and based upon ceramic, metallic or polymeric materials. This enables a wide range of properties to be incorporated into nanocomposite materials, such as magnetic properties, MR imaging contrast or drug delivery, and even a combination of these properties. Much of the classical research was focused on bone regeneration, however, recent advances have enabled further use in soft tissue body sites too. Despite recent technological advances, more research is needed to further understand the long-term biocompatibility impact of the use of nanoparticles within the human body.
