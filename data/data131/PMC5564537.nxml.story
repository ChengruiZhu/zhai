Many studies have been conducted to investigate the association between miR-27 rs895819 A > G and miR-423 rs6505162 C > A and cancer risk; however, the results are not consistent. In order to acquire a more precise assessment of the correlation, we performed this meta-analysis. We searched PubMed, EMBASE and Web of Science databases to identify eligible studies. Pooled odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were applied to evaluate the correlation of these two microRNA polymorphisms with cancer risk. Forty-five eligible studies from thirty-five articles were included in our analysis. The results showed that rs895819 was associated with a decreased cancer risk in Caucasians (AG vs. AA: OR = 0.87, 95% CI = 0.79-0.96; GG+AG vs. AA: OR = 0.89, 95% CI = 0.81-0.98). When grouped by ethnicity, an increased risk was observed in colorectal cancer (G vs. A: OR = 1.19, 95% CI = 1.08-1.32; GG vs. AA: OR = 1.58, 95% CI = 1.28-1.96; GG vs. AG+AA: OR = 1.58, 95% CI = 1.29-1.93), while a decreased risk was found in breast cancer (G vs. A: OR = 0.93, 95% CI = 0.87-0.99; GG+AG vs. AA: OR = 0.91, 95% CI = 0.83-0.99). For rs6505162, a significantly decreased cancer risk was observed in lung cancer under all five genetic models. To summarize, our results indicated that rs895819 was a protective factor for cancer in Caucasians and could increase colorectal cancer risk but decrease breast cancer risk. Moreover, rs6505162 was a protective factor for lung cancer.
