Previous studies have reported an association of gamma/delta T cells with microbial infection in both human lesions and murine infectious disease models. In this study we provide a comprehensive analysis of the conditions under which the induction of gamma/delta T cells occurs at a site of infection. We found a site-specific induction of gamma/delta T cells after the injection of Listeria monocytogenes in the peritoneal cavity of C3H mice. No changes were seen in the splenic or lymph node populations after these injections. Both the proportion and the absolute number of gamma/delta T cells increased in the peritoneal cavity. Additionally, when peritoneal T cells from Listeria- immune mice were restimulated in vitro, the induced gamma/delta T cells exhibited a greater expansion potential than the alpha/beta T cells. Neither the induced gamma/delta T cells nor those from normal mice expressed CD4 or CD8 on the cell surface. Thy-1 was expressed on only 29% of normal peritoneal gamma/delta T cells, but after intraperitoneal Listeria injection 65% of induced gamma/delta T cells expressed. Thy-1, Pgp-1 and CD45R expression on both normal and induced gamma/delta T cells was consistent with an activation phenotype. Significant increases in peritoneal gamma/delta T cells were not seen until 5-7 d after Listeria injection. The proportion of the CD3+ population expressing the gamma/delta T cell receptor remained elevated for 6-7 wk, while the absolute numbers of peritoneal gamma/delta T cells declined gradually over this time period, reflecting a decrease in both the number of lymphocytes and the percentage of these that were CD3+. Peak numbers of gamma/delta T cells were seen at day 10 with live microbes such as Listeria. A variety of microbes, toxins, mitogens, antigens, cytokines, and nonspecific inflammatory agents were evaluated for their ability to induce gamma/delta T cells in the peritoneal cavity. Both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria as well as Mycobacteria were able to induce gamma/delta T cells that showed increased in vitro expansion potential. An exotoxin from a Gram- positive organism, listeriolysin-o, and the lipopolysaccharide (LPS) endotoxin from a Gram-negative organism were also effective. gamma/delta T cell responses to LPS were under lps gene control. Peak numbers of gamma/delta T cells were observed at day 3 after injection with exotoxins and endotoxins. Modifications that abrogated the virulence of a bacterial strain also eliminated the inductive effect for gamma/delta T cells.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)
