Semi-structured interviews with new smear-positive PTB patients (≥15 years) registered for treatment. Between April 2007 and April 2008, 253 patients were studied. The median total delay was 8 weeks (IQR 4–12), median patient delay was 4 weeks (inter-quartile range [IQR] 1–8) and median health service delay was 4 weeks (IQR 2–8). Long total delay (>14 weeks) was observed for 61/253 (24.1%) of patients, long health service delay (>6 weeks) for 71/242 (29.3%) and long patient delay (>8 weeks) for 47/242 (19.4%). Patients who knew that TB was curable were less likely to have long total delay (adjusted Odds Ratio [aOR] 0.28; 95%CI 0.11–0.73) and long patient delay (aOR 0.36; 95%CI 0.13–0.97). Being female (aOR 1.98; 95%CI 1.06–3.71), staying for more than 5 years at current residence (aOR 2.24 95%CI 1.18–4.27) and having been tested for HIV before (aOR 3.72; 95%CI 1.42–9.75) was associated with long health service delay. Health service delay contributed 50% of the total delay. Ninety-one percent (231) of patients had visited one or more health care providers before they were diagnosed, for an average (median) of 4 visits (range 1–30). All but four patients had systemic symptoms by the time the diagnosis of TB was made.
