 and their clinical applications. A microRNA, miR-125b, has been suggested to have important roles in the self-renewal of megakaryocyte-erythroid progenitors and in platelet generation. However, miR-125b is also critical for hematopoietic stem cell self-renewal. Thus, the function of miR-125b and the complex signaling pathways regulating megakaryopoiesis remain to be elucidated. In this study, an attentive examination of the endogenous expression of miR-125b during megakaryocyte differentiation was performed. Accordingly, the differentiation of hematopoietic stem cells requires the downregulation of miR-125b, whereas megakaryocyte determination and maturation synchronize with miR-125b accumulation. The overexpression of miR-125b improves megakaryocytic differentiation of K562 and UT-7 cells. Furthermore, stage-specific overexpression of miR-125b in primary cells demonstrates that miR-125b mediates an enhancement of megakaryocytic differentiation after megakaryocyte determination, the stage at which megakaryocytes are negative for the expression of the hematopoietic progenitor marker CD34. The identification of miR-125b targets during megakaryopoiesis was focused on negative regulators of cell cycle because the transition of the G1/S phase has been associated with megakaryocyte polyploidization. Real-time PCR, western blot and luciferase reporter assay reveal that p19
