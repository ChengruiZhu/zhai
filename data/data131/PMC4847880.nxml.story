Pancreatic progenitor cell research has been in the spotlight, as these cells have the potential to replace pancreatic β‐cells for the treatment of type 1 and 2 diabetic patients with the absence or reduction of pancreatic β‐cells. During the past few decades, the successful treatment of diabetes through transplantation of the whole pancreas or isolated islets has nearly been achieved. However, novel sources of pancreatic islets or insulin‐producing cells are required to provide sufficient amounts of donor tissues. To overcome this limitation, the use of pancreatic progenitor cells is gaining more attention. In particular, pancreatic exocrine cells, such as duct epithelial cells and acinar cells, are attractive candidates for β‐cell regeneration because of their differentiation potential and pancreatic lineage characteristics. It has been assumed that β‐cell neogenesis from pancreatic progenitor cells could occur in pancreatic ducts in the postnatal stage. Several studies have shown that insulin‐producing cells can arise in the duct tissue of the adult pancreas. Acinar cells also might have the potential to differentiate into insulin‐producing cells. The present review summarizes recent progress in research on the transdifferentiation of pancreatic exocrine cells into insulin‐producing cells, especially duct and acinar cells.
