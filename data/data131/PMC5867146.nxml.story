‐driven efflux transporter P‐glycoprotein (P‐gp) is expressed in normal and malignant tissues and extrudes structurally distinct endogenous and exogenous cytotoxic compounds. Thus, once aromatic hydrophobic compounds such as the above‐mentioned fluorescent probes are recognized as transport substrates, efflux pumps including P‐gp may abolish their ability to reach their cellular target organelles. Herein, we show that LysoTracker and MitoTracker Red are expelled from P‐gp‐overexpressing cancer cells, thus hindering their ability to fluorescently mark target organelles. We further demonstrate that tariquidar, a potent P‐gp transport inhibitor, restores LysoTracker and MitoTracker Red cell entry. We conclude that LysoTracker and MitoTracker Red are P‐gp transport substrates, and therefore, P‐gp expression must be taken into consideration prior to cellular applications using these probes. Importantly, as MitoTracker was a superior P‐gp substrate than LysoTracker Red, we discuss the implications for the future design of chemotherapeutics evading cancer multidrug resistance. Furthermore, restoration of MitoTracker Red fluorescence in P‐gp‐overexpressing cells may facilitate the identification of potent P‐gp transport inhibitors (
