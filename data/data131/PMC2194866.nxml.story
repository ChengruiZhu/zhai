 Response patterns resulting from repetitive mechanical stimulation of the corpuscle depend on (1) the time course of recovery of the generator potential, on (2) the recovery of critical firing height, and on (3) the stimulus strength/generator potential function. By either augmenting stimulus frequency at constant strength, or by reducing strength at constant frequency, a sequence of propagated potentials is turned into a pattern of alternating regenerative and generator responses. In such a pattern an extra impulse can be set up whenever an extra stimulus produces a generator potential of enough amplitude to reach the firing height of the corresponding period. The new requirements of firing height introduced by the refractory trail of the extra impulse determine resetting of periodicity and appearance of a "compensatory pause." The decay time of the single generator potential is independent of stimulus duration. This is interpreted as a factor determining receptor adaptation. Upon repetitive stimulation at intervals above Â½ decay time of the single generator potential, a compound generator potential is built up which shows no spontaneous decline. However, in spite of being considerably greater than the firing height for single impulses, the constant level of depolarization of the compound generator potential is unable to produce propagated potentials. A hypothesis is brought forward which considers the generator potential to arise from membrane units with fluctuating excitability scattered over the non-myelinated nerve ending.
