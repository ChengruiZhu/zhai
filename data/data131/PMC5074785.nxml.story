Most biologists appreciate that natural selection filters new mutations (e.g., by eliminating deleterious ones), such that genetic variation in nature is biased. The idea that selection also skews the types of genetic interactions that exist in nature is less appreciated. For example, studies spanning diverse species have shown that the protein Hsp90, which helps other proteins to fold properly, tends to diminish the observable effects of genetic variation. This observation has led to the assumption that Hsp90 also buffers the effects of new mutations. This untested assumption has served as a rationale for cancer-treatment strategies and shaped our understanding of variation in complex traits. We measured the effects of new mutations on the shapes and sizes of individual yeast cells and found that Hsp90 does not tend to buffer these effects. Instead, Hsp90 interacts with new mutations in diverse ways, sometimes buffering, but more often enhancing mutational effects on cell shape and size. We conclude that selection preferentially allows buffered mutations to persist in natural populations. This result alters common perceptions about why cryptic (i.e., buffered) genetic variation exists and casts doubt on cancer-treatment strategies aiming to target presumed buffers of mutational effects.
