The striatum is a part of the basal ganglia which plays a role in addiction and reward learning. Its importance is underscored by pathologies such as Parkinson's disease and Huntington's disease in which degeneration of the dopamine inputs to the striatum or degeneration of neurons in the striatum, respectively, produces motor dysfunction. Dopamine in the striatum activates cascades of signaling molecules, ultimately producing an activity dependent change in the strength of connections between neurons. However, the dispersive movement of signaling molecules seems incompatible with the strengthening of specific subsets of connections, which is required for formation of distinct memories. Anchoring proteins, which restrict molecules to particular compartments within the neuron, are proposed to achieve specificity. We develop a reaction-diffusion model of dopamine activated signaling pathways to explore mechanisms whereby anchoring proteins can produce specificity. We use an efficient Monte-Carlo simulator to implement the cascades of signaling molecules in a neuronal dendrite with multiple dendritic spines. Simulations demonstrate that spatial specificity requires both anchoring proteins and inactivation mechanisms that limit the diffusion of signaling molecules.
