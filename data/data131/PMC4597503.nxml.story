There were 62 patients who were treated acutely, 37 subacute, and 36 chronic. One hundred twelve meniscal tears, 70 lateral and 42 medial, were found in this cohort. Eighty percent of the patients, ages 8 - 12 had a meniscal tear and 84% of patients ages 13 - 16 had a meniscal tear. Multi-variant logistic regression revealed the risk factors for lateral meniscus tears were younger age (P = .007) and increased time to surgery (P = .008). The odds ratio of lateral meniscus tears for patients who had a single episode of instability was 3.1. For time to surgery, the odds ratio was 1 for acute reconstruction, 2.6 for subacute, and 2.59 for reconstruction of chronic injuries. The odds ratio for increased grade of tear was 3.3 for a giving-way episode and 6.5 for increased time to surgery. For medial meniscus tears, the risk factors were: older age (P = .001), increasing time to surgery (P = .007), return to sports (P = .044), and instability episodes (P = .001). Risk factors for increasing grade of medial meniscus tears were: time to surgery, return to sports, and any instability episode (P = < .001 for all). The odds ratio for increasing frequency of medial meniscus tears was 4.7 for an instability episode, 8.08 for having played sports prior to reconstruction, and 4.49 for increased time to surgery. The odds ratio for having increased severity of meniscal tears was: any instability episode 6.61; having played sports prior to reconstruction 15.25, and time to surgery 4.28. There were 17 chondral injuries in this cohort. The risk factors for chondral injury were: increased time to surgery (P = .005) and any instability episode (P = .001). For increased grade of chondral injury, the risk factors were: time to surgery (P = less than .001) and any instability episode (P = .003).
