 studies report that MSCs rescue injured cells through delivery of their own mitochondria. However, the role of mitochondria conveyed from somatic cells to MSC remains unknown. By using a co-culture system consisting of MSC and distressed somatic cells such as cardiomyocytes or endothelial cells, we showed that mitochondria from suffering cells acted as danger-signaling organelles that triggered the anti-apoptotic function of MSC. We demonstrated that foreign somatic-derived mitochondria were engulfed and degraded by MSC, leading to induction of the cytoprotective enzyme heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) and stimulation of mitochondrial biogenesis. As a result, the capacity of MSC to donate their mitochondria to injured cells to combat oxidative stress injury was enhanced. We found that similar mechanisms – activation of autophagy, HO-1 and mitochondrial biogenesis – occurred after exposure of MSC to exogenous mitochondria isolated from somatic cells, strengthening the idea that somatic mitochondria alert MSC of a danger situation and subsequently promote an adaptive reparative response. In addition, the cascade of events triggered by the transfer of somatic mitochondria into MSC was recapitulated in a model of myocardial infarction
