The aim of this study was to establish the incidence, risk factors, and the management of pharyngocutaneous fistula (PCF) after primary and salvage total laryngectomy. A retrospective, match-paired analysis of 86 patients who developed fistula after total laryngectomy was carried out and compared with a control group of 86 patients without fistula, randomly selected from a pool of 352 total laryngectomies, performed between January 1999 to October 2014. The overall incidence of PCF in the series was 24.4%; we recorded rates of 19.0%, 28.6% and 30.3% following primary total laryngectomy (PTL), salvage laryngectomy post-radiotherapy (RT-STL) and salvage laryngectomy postchemoradiotherapy (CRT-STL), respectively. Multivariate analysis revealed that the relative risk of fistula was respectively 2.47, 3.09 and 7.69 for hypoalbuminaemia â‰¤3.5 g/dL, RT-STL and CRT-STL. An early onset of PCF within 10 postoperative days was recorded in case of salvage total laryngectomy. The management of PCF significantly differed between PTL, RT-STL and CTRT-STL, with exclusive conservative treatment for PTL (93.55%), while in the CRT-STL group surgical closure with regional flaps (58.82%) prevailed. Conservative management, adjuvant hyperbaric oxygen therapy and surgical closure were equally distributed in the RT-STL group. Thorough knowledge of patient-related risk factors and its prognostic value, allows the surgeon to better evaluate preventive strategies with the aim of minimising fistula formation, hospitalisation times and related costs.
