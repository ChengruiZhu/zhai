There was no statistically significant difference between the mean MAP and MT diameters of the donor tendons at 12±2 and 24±2 months postoperatively (P>0.05). The mean MAP and MT diameters of the patellar tendon defect at 24±2 months were significantly smaller compared to 12±2 months postoperatively (P<0.01). The mean MAP diameter of the harvested tendon was significantly greater at all measured sites in comparison to the contralateral tendon at 12±2 and 24±2 months postoperatively (P<0.01). There was no statistically significant difference between the mean MT diameters of the donor and healthy tendons at 12±2 and 24±2 months postoperatively (P>0.05). At 12±2 months, the mean MAP diameter of the patellar tendon defect was 4.0±2.1 mm, 4.7±2.8 mm and 4.1±2.4 mm at the proximal, middle and distal third of the tendon respectively. The mean MT diameter of the defect was 3.3±2.2 mm (proximal third), 2.9±1.6 mm (middle third) and 2.1±0.9 mm (distal third). 2 of tendon defects showed low echogenicity, 6 mixed echogenicity, 2 patients normal echogenicity. At 24±2 months the mean MAP diameter of the patellar tendon defect was 0.3±0.3 mm, 0.4±0.4 mm and 0.3±0.3 mm at the proximal, middle and distal third of the tendon respectively. The mean MT diameter of the defect was 0.3±0.3 mm (proximal third), 0.2±0.2 mm (middle third) and 0.2±0.2 mm (distal third). 27 of patients demonstrated normal echogenicity, 1 low echogenicity, while 2 mixed echogenicity. No tendon exhibited any signs of neovascularization at 12±2 and 24±2 months postoperatively.
