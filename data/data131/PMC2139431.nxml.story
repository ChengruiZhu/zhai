 Anti-idiotypic antisera against six restricted rabbit streptococcal group specific antibodies have been raised in rabbits matched for allotypes. All these antisera reacted specifically with their homologous idiotypes on double-diffusion tests in agarose gel. In addition, they showed a high incidence of cross-specificities with group-specific hyperimmune sera induced in both closely related and unrelated individuals. These precipitating cross-specificities could be explained for two systems by the interference of rheumatoid factor. Two idiotypic antibody systems have been analyzed in detail; these were restricted antibodies produced in a father and in one of his offspring. The methods employed included binding inhibition of radio-labeled homologous Fab fragments and hemagglutination inhibition with homologous idiotypic coat. The data demonstrated that only related rabbits produced, besides non-cross-reacting antibodies, idiotypically similar antibodies raised to the same antigen. About one-third of the cross-reactive idiotypes showed binding inhibition between 31 and 92%. Inhibition of binding above 50% in the paternal idiotypic system was only achieved by one offspring antibody whereas the F
