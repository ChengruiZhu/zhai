This paper provides an update and comprehensive review of the analytical methods used for quantifying isoflavones and their metabolites in cow’s milk. Isoflavones are secondary plant metabolites that are similar to 17 β-estradiol in chemical structure. They form one of the most common categories of phytoestrogens. Numerous health benefits have been attributed to isoflavones, but many of these compounds are also considered to be endocrine disruptors, with adverse effects on health. These contradictory trends offer an attractive prospect for future research, and therefore, sensitive and reliable analytical methods are required to clarify various issues about isoflavones. For this review, a structured methodology was used to select 26 relevant articles published between 2005 and 2015 from the Scopus and CAB Abstract databases. The review discusses individual steps of the analytical procedures described in these articles, including sample preparation, instrumental analysis and validation. The most commonly used analytical procedure is sample preparation involving liquid-liquid extraction and an enzymatic hydrolysis step followed by liquid chromatography with mass spectrometry analysis. Currently, however, there is no standardized procedure for the sample preparation and analysis of isoflavones in milk.
