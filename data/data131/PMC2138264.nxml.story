) continuous intravenous infusions of old tuberculin into specifically sensitized animals rapidly elicit a pyrogenic refractory state. The present observations, considered together with those of other investigators, support the hypothesis that pyrogenic unresponsiveness to endotoxin involves two distinct immunologic mechanisms. In terms of this hypothesis, the rapid reduction in febrile responsiveness to endotoxin is mediated by desensitization at the cellular level. With small doses of endotoxin, such as those employed in the present studies, this desensitization is primarily specific; with larger doses, nonspecific mechanisms are superimposed. So long as the subsequent doses of endotoxin are closely spaced or continuously infused, optimal conditions are provided for cellular desensitization and pyrogenic unresponsiveness to a given quantity of endotoxin can be induced rapidly and maintained without the requirement for antibody. However, as the interval between endotoxin challenge is lengthened, cellular desensitization wanes and tolerance becomes increasingly dependent upon those antibodies directed against the common toxophore groupings responsible for endotoxin pyrogenicity which assist the reticuloendothelial system in the clearance and destruction of this molecule.
