Overall, 338 (266 female and 72 male) patients were enrolled. Among demographic features, gender, younger age at onset, positive family history, and parental consanguinity were not associated with disease severity. Education was weakly associated with disease severity. Among clinical factors, presenting symptoms such as poly-symptomatic attacks, walking difficulty, and upper and lower extremity dysfunction were associated with more disability while presentation with optic neuritis had better prognosis. Complete recovery after the first attack, longer interval between the first and second attacks, lower number of symptoms at presentation, shorter duration of attacks, and relapsing-remitting course were associated with less disability and better prognosis. These results were noticed in ordinal logistic regression. However when multiple logistic regression was performed, the strongest determinant of disease severity was disease course with odds ratio (OR) = 49.12 for secondary progressive course and OR = 53.25 for primary progressive (Â± relapse) course. Walking difficulty as the presenting symptom had a borderline association with disease severity (OR = 2.31; P = 0.055). Increased number of onset symptoms was associated (but not significantly) with more severe disease.
