Piwi-interacting RNAs (piRNAs/piRs) are small non-coding RNAs that can serve important roles in genome stability by silencing transposable genetic elements. piR651, one of these novel piRNAs, regulates a number of biological functions, as well as carcinogenesis. Previous studies have reported that piR651 is overexpressed in human gastric cancer tissues and in several cancer cell lines, including non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cell lines. However, the role of piRNAs in carcinogenesis has not been clearly defined. In the present study, a small interfering RNA inhibitor of piR651 was transfected into the NSCLC A549 and HCC827 cell lines to evaluate the effect of piR651 on cell growth. The association between piR651 expression and apoptosis was evaluated by flow cytometry and western blot analysis. Wound-healing and Transwell migration and invasion assays were used to determine the effect of piR651 on the migration and invasion of NSCLC cell lines. The results revealed that inhibition of piR651 inhibited cell proliferation and significantly increased the apoptotic rate compared with the negative control (NC), as well as altering the expression of apoptosis-associated proteins. There were fewer migrating and invading cells in the piR651-inhibited group than in the NC group in the Transwell assays. Furthermore, in the wound-healing assay, the wound remained wider in the piR651 inhibitor group, suggesting decreased cell migration compared with that in the NC group. The results of the present study demonstrate that piR651 potentially regulates NSCLC tumorigenic behavior by inhibiting cell proliferation, migration and invasion and by inducing apoptosis. Therefore, piR651 is a potential cancer diagnosis marker.
