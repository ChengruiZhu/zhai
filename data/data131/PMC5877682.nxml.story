Neuroinflammation, characterized marked by microglial activation, plays a very important role in the pathogenesis of Parkinson’s disease (PD). Upon activation, pro-inflammatory mediators are produced by microglia, triggering excessive inflammatory responses and ultimately damaging dopaminergic neurons. Therefore, the identification of agents that inhibit neuroinflammation may be an effective approach for developing novel treatments for PD. In this study, we sought to investigate whether peiminine protects dopaminergic neurons by inhibiting neuroinflammation. We evaluated the effects of peiminine on behavioural dysfunction, microglial activation and the loss of dopaminergic neurons in a rat model of lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced PD. BV-2 cells were pretreated with peiminine for 1 h and then stimulated with LPS for different times. Then, inflammatory responses and the related signalling pathways were analysed. Peiminine markedly attenuated behavioural dysfunction and inhibited the loss of dopaminergic neurons and microglial activation in the LPS-induced PD rat model. In BV-2 cells, peiminine significantly decreased LPS-induced expression of the pro-inflammatory mediators TNF-α, IL-6 and IL-1β, COX-2 and iNOS by inhibiting the phosphorylation of ERK1/2, AKT and NF-κB p65. Based on these results demonstrated that peiminine has a role in protecting dopaminergic neurons in the LPS-induced PD rat model by inhibiting neuroinflammation.
