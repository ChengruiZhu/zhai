Cells are complex functional units. Signal transduction refers to the underlying mechanism that regulates cell function, and it is usually depicted on signaling pathways maps. Each cell type has distinct signaling transduction mechanisms, and several diseases arise from alterations on the signaling pathways. Small-molecule inhibitors have emerged as novel pharmaceutical interventions that aim to block certain pathways in an effort to reverse the abnormal phenotype of the diseased cells. Despite that compounds have been well designed to hit certain molecules (i.e., targets), little is known on how they act on an “operative” signaling network. Here, we combine novel high throughput protein-signaling measurements and sophisticated computational techniques to evaluate drug effects on cells. Our approach comprises of two steps: build pathways that simulate cell function and identify drug-induced alterations of those pathways. We employed our approach to evaluate the effects of 4 drugs on a cancer hepatocytic cell type. We were able to confirm the main target of the drugs but also uncover unknown off-target effects. By understanding the drug effects in normal and diseased cells we can provide important information for the analysis of clinical outcomes in order to improve drug efficacy and safety.
