A key component of survival is the ability to learn which actions, in what contexts, yield useful and rewarding outcomes. Actions are encoded in the brain in the cortex but, as many actions are possible at any one time, there needs to be a mechanism to select which one is to be performed. This problem of action selection is mediated by a set of nuclei known as the basal ganglia, which receive convergent “action requests” from all over the cortex and select the one that is currently most important. Working out which is most important is determined by the strength of the input from each action request: the stronger the connection, the more important that action. Understanding learning thus requires understanding how that strength is changed by the outcome of each action. We built a computational model that demonstrates how the brain's internal signal for outcome (carried by the neurotransmitter dopamine) changes the strength of these cortical connections to learn the selection of rewarded actions, and the suppression of unrewarded ones. Our model shows how several known signals in the brain work together to shape the influence of cortical inputs to the basal ganglia at the interface between our actions and their outcomes.
