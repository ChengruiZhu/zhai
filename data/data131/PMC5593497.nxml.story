To date, there are no serum biomarkers available for the prediction of recurrent nasopharyngeal carcinoma (rNPC). The diagnosis of rNPC mostly depends on imaging and biopsy of diseased tissue; however, both of these methods work mostly if the target tumor is at an advanced stage. Therefore, the identificaqtion of recurrent biomarkers is urgently required. In the present study, we used tandem mass tag (TMT) labeling and high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) fractionation followed by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) to identify differentially expressed proteins. Serum was collected from 40 patients with NPC [recurrence (n=20) and no recurrence (n=20)]. Compared to non-recurrent NPC (nrNPC), we found 59 proteins to be significantly dysregulated in rNPC; most of these have been previously reported to play a role in carcinogenesis. The dysregulation of calmodulin (CALM) was confirmed in 74 new patients [recurrence (n=32) and no recurrence (n=42)] by ELISA. Moreover, we performed a preliminary pathway analysis which revealed that oxidative phosphorylation was altered in the patients with rNPC compared to those with nrNPC. Taken together, these data identify a potential diagnostic biomarker for rNPC and elucidate the potential molecular mechanisms that are dysregulated and contribute to the pathogenesis of rNPC.
