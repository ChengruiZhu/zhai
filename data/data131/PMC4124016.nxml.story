The prevalence of obesity has been increasing worldwide. Chemerin is a recently discovered adipokine secreted by the enlarged adipose tissue with diverse biological effects that are not well detailed yet. This study aimed to elucidate the potential role of chemerin in oxidative stress and inflammation that are characteristics for excess weight and may eventually lead to insulin resistance and atherosclerotic complications. We also analysed the associations between chemerin and classical adipokines, namely leptin and adiponectin. Therefore, we investigated non-diabetic obese patients without manifest cardiovascular disease and compared their data to healthy lean individuals. Chemerin correlated positively with markers of oxidative stress and inflammation, while it showed a negative correlation with the measure of antioxidant status, characterized by the HDL-linked paraoxonase-1 enzyme. Chemerin also correlated positively with leptin and negatively with adiponectin respectively. In our study population, oxidized low-density lipoprotein and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein were found to be the strongest predictors of chemerin level. We conclude that chemerin may contribute to chronic inflammation and increased oxidative stress in obese individuals, even in the absence of manifest insulin resistance.
