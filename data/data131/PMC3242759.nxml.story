Tetracycline (TC) and chlortetracycline (CTC) are common members of the widely used veterinary drug tetracyclines, the residue of which in the environment can enter human body, being potentially harmful. In this study, we establish a new strategy to probe the binding modes of TC and CTC with trypsin based on spectroscopic and computational modeling methods. Both TC and CTC can interact with trypsin with one binding site to form trypsin-TC (CTC) complex, mainly through van der Waals' interactions and hydrogen bonds with the affinity order: TC>CTC. The bound TC (CTC) can result in inhibition of trypsin activity with the inhibition order: CTC>TC. The secondary structure and the microenvironment of the tryptophan residues of trypsin were also changed. However, the effect of CTC on the secondary structure content of trypsin was contrary to that of TC. Both the molecular docking study and the trypsin activity experiment revealed that TC bound into S1 binding pocket, competitively inhibiting the enzyme activity, and CTC was a non-competitive inhibitor which bound to a non-active site of trypsin, different from TC due to the Cl atom on the benzene ring of CTC which hinders CTC entering into the S1 binding pocket. CTC does not hinder the binding of the enzyme substrate, but the CTC-trypsin-substrate ternary complex can not further decompose into the product. The work provides basic data for clarifying the binding mechanisms of TC (CTC) with trypsin and can help to comprehensively understanding of the enzyme toxicity of different members of tetracyclines
