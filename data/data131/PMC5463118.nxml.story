Mitochondria are important bioenergetic and signalling hubs critical for myriad cellular functions and homeostasis. Dysfunction in mitochondria is a central theme in aging and diseases. Mitophagy, a process whereby damaged mitochondria are selectively removed by autophagy, plays a key homeostatic role in mitochondrial quality control. Upregulation of mitophagy has shown to mitigate superfluous mitochondrial accumulation and toxicity to safeguard mitochondrial fitness. Hence, mitophagy is a viable target to promote longevity and prevent age-related pathologies. Current challenge in modulating mitophagy for cellular protection involves identification of physiological ways to activate the pathway. Till date, mitochondrial stress and toxins remain the most potent inducers of mitophagy. Polyphenols have recently been demonstrated to protect mitochondrial health by facilitating mitophagy, thus suggesting the exciting prospect of augmenting mitophagy through dietary intake. In this review, we will first discuss the different surveillance mechanisms responsible for the removal of damaged mitochondrial components, followed by highlighting the transcriptional regulatory mechanisms of mitophagy. Finally, we will review the functional connection between polyphenols and mitophagy and provide insight into the underlying mechanisms that potentially govern polyphenol-induced mitophagy.
