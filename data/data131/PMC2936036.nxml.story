Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is one of the leading causes of morbidity and mortality. Periodic spirometry is often recommended for individuals with potential occupational exposure to respiratory hazards and in medical treatment of respiratory disease, to prevent COPD or improve treatment outcome. To achieve the full potential of spirometry monitoring in preserving lung function, it is important to maintain acceptable precision of the longitudinal measurements, apply interpretive strategies that identify individuals with abnormal test results or excessive loss of lung function in a timely manner, and use the results for intervention on respiratory disease prevention or treatment modification. We describe novel, easy-to-use visual and analytical software, Spirometry Longitudinal Data Analysis software (SPIROLA), designed to assist healthcare providers in the above aspects of spirometry monitoring. Software application in ongoing workplace spirometry-based medical monitoring programs helped to identify increased spirometry data variability due to deteriorating test quality and subsequent improvement following interventions, and helped to enhance identification of individuals with excessive decline in lung function.
