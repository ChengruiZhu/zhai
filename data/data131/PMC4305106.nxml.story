-methoxyethyl chimeric antisense oligonucleotide (ASO), inhibits the synthesis of apolipoprotein B (apoB) and is indicated in the US as an adjunct therapy for homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (HoFH) at a dose of 200 mg subcutaneously (SC) once weekly. The pharmacokinetic (PK) properties of mipomersen are generally consistent across all species studied, including mouse, rat, monkey, and humans. After SC administration, mipomersen is rapidly and extensively absorbed. It has an apparent plasma and tissue terminal elimination half-life of approximately 30 days. Mipomersen achieves steady-state tissue concentrations within approximately 4–6 months of once-weekly dosing. It does not exhibit PK-based drug–drug interactions with other concomitant medications, either involving competition for plasma protein binding or alterations in disposition of any evaluated drugs. Furthermore, mipomersen does not prolong the corrected QT (QTc) interval. There have been no ethnic- or gender-related differences in PK observed. In clinical trials, both as a single agent and in the presence of maximal lipid-lowering therapy, mipomersen has demonstrated significant dose-dependent reductions in all measured apoB-containing atherogenic lipoproteins. Overall, mipomersen has well-characterized PK and pharmacodynamic properties in both animals and humans, and is an efficacious adjunct treatment for patients with HoFH.
