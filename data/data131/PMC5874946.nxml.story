 from the center of the first nominal dwell position. Measurements were taken at 5 mm depth in a SW phantom and in air at the applicator surface. The results were then compared to the vendor's data and to the Acuros calculated dose. Relative dose measurements using Gafchromic films were taken at a depth of 4 mm in SW. Percent depth ionization (PDI) measurements using ion chamber were performed in SW. The profiles generated from film measurements and the PDI plots were compared with those computed using the Acuros algorithm and vendor's data, when available. Preliminary leakage tests were performed using optically stimulated luminescence dosimeters (OSLDs) and the results were compared with Acuros predictions. All applicators were found to be functional with physical dimensions within 1 mm of specifications. For scenario (ii) measurements taken in SW at 5 mm depth and in air at the surface of each applicator were within 10% and 4% agreement with vendor's data, respectively. Compared with Acuros predictions, these measurements were within 6% and 5%, respectively. Measurements taken for scenario (i) showed reduced agreement with both the vendor's data as well as the Acuros calculations, especially when using the 10 mm applicator. The full widths of the measured dose profiles were within 2 mm of those predicted by Acuros at the 90% dose level. The PDI plots and measured leakage dose were in good agreement with vendor's data and Acuros predictions. Based on the dosimetric results, a quality assurance program and procedures for clinical implementation were developed. Treatment planning will be performed using scenario (ii). The 10 mm applicator will not be released for clinical use. A prescription depth of 4 mm is recommended, to ensure full coverage at 3 mm and a minimum dose of 90% of prescribed dose at 4 mm depth.
