Surgical treatment of advanced cancers of the hypopharynx inevitably impairs swallowing, respiration and phonation. The purpose of this study was to analyze the functional results after circumferential pharyngolaryngectomy (CPL) and flap reconstruction, in order to offer decisional guidelines for the choice of the most effective reconstructive method. We performed a retrospective analysis on the medical records of patients submitted to reconstructive surgery after CPL from July 1991 to November 2011. 75% of the 94 patients underwent reconstruction with a free flap (group A), while 25% underwent reconstruction with a pedicled flap (group B); 80% of patients in group A and none in group B were discharged with a free diet; 14% of patients in group A and 26% in group B were unable to resume oral feeding and were discharged with NG-tube or PEG. None of the patients acquired a satisfactory oesophageal voice; 17% of patients in group A and 7% in group B underwent voice restoration with tracheo-oesophageal voice-prosthesis. In conclusion, free flaps should be considered the first choice for reconstruction of the hypopharynx after CPL because of the better functional results obtained. Pedicled flaps represent a valid alternative in patients with contraindications to microvascular surgery.
