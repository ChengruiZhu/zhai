The effects of changes in the concentration of calcium in solutions bathing Myxicola giant axons on the voltage dependence of sodium and potassium conductance and on the instantaneous sodium and potassium current-voltage relations have been measured. The sodium conductance- voltage relation is shifted along the voltage axis by 13 mV in the hyperpolarizing direction for a fourfold decrease in calcium concentration. The potassium conductance-voltage relation is shifted only half as much as that for sodium. There is no effect on the shape of the sodium and potassium instantaneous current-voltage curves: the normal constant-field rectification of potassium currents is maintained and the normal linear relationship of sodium currents is maintained. Considering that shifts in conductances would reflect the presence of surface charges near the gating machinery and that shape changes of instantaneous current-voltage curves would reflect the presence of surface charges near the ionic pores, these results indicate a negative surface charge density of about 1 electronic charge per 120 A2 near the sodium gating machinery, about 1 e/300 A2 for the potassium gating machinery, and much less surface charge near the sodium or potassium pores. There may be some specific binding of calcium to these surface charges with an upper limit on the binding constant of about 0.2 M-1. The differences in surface charge density suggest a spatial separation for these four membrane components.
