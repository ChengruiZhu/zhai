Technological advances have changed the practice of clinical microbiology. We implemented Bruker matrix-assisted laser desorption ionizationâ€“time of flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) and BD Kiestra total laboratory automation (TLA) 4 and 3 years ago, respectively. To assess the impact of these new technologies, we compared turnaround times (TATs) for positive and negative urine cultures before and after implementation. In comparison I, TATs for 61,157 urine cultures were extracted for two periods corresponding to pre-TLA and post-TLA, both using MALDI-TOF MS for organism identification. In comparison II, time to organism identification (ID) and antimicrobial susceptibility (AST) reports were calculated for 5,402 positive culture reports representing four different periods: (i) manual plating and conventional biochemical identification (CONV), (ii) manual plating and MALDI-TOF MS identification (MALDI), (iii) MALDI-TOF MS identification and early phase implementation of TLA (TLA1), and (iv) MALDI-TOF MS identification and late phase implementation of TLA (TLA2). By the comparison I results, median pre- and post-TLA TATs to organism IDs (18.5 to 16.9 h), AST results (41.8 to 40.8 h), and preliminary results for negative cultures (17.7 to 13.6 h), including interquartile ranges for all comparisons, were significantly decreased post-TLA (
