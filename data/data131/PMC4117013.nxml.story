The age of onset of seizures was less than 15 years in only one third of the total patients. The number of non-vegetarians was higher in SE (68.5%) than IE (58%). The male to female ratio was significantly higher (1.33:1 in IE and 1.47:1 in SE). No difference was seen for place of residence (urban vs rural) patients with epilepsy (PWE). The majority of patients (58.5% of symptomatic and 52.8% idiopathic) though reported no triggering factors, yet many of them, when questioned, had held supernatural powers to be the cause of the disease. Sleep deprivation was reported as a major triggering factor by 28.5% of idiopathic epilepsy (IE) and 25% of symptomatic epilepsy (SE) patients. The incidence of mental retardation (1.25%) and behavioral disorders (7%) was found to be relatively low. Loss of memory was reported in 46% of IE and 43.5% of SE and poor scholastic performance in 23% of IE and 16.5% of SE. A positive history was recorded in 11% first-degree relatives and 4% second-degree relatives. Generalized seizures were more common in IE patients (67.5%), while partial seizures with and without secondary generalization (50.5%), and generalized seizures (49.5%) were equally common in SE.
