, is a species of scallop and a marine bivalve mollusk. In traditional East Asian medicine, scallop meat is used as a drug for the treatment of diabetes, pollakisuria, and indigestion. The present study was conducted in order to examine the potential anticancer effects of scallop flesh extract (SE) on MCF-7 human breast cancer cells. An MTT assay was used to evaluate cell viability and flow cytometry was used for the assessment of cell cycle distribution and apoptosis. The alteration in protein expression level was determined by western blot analysis, and the amounts of docosahexaenoic acid and eicosapentaenoic acid in the SE were measured by gas chromatography. SE inhibited the growth of MCF-7 human breast cancer cells in a dose-dependent manner by inducing G0/G1 phase arrest. The cell cycle arrest was associated with the upregulation of p53 and p21, and downregulation of G1 phase-associated cyclin D1/cyclin-dependent kinase (Cdk) 4 and cyclin E1/Cdk 2. In addition, SE-mediated cell cycle arrest was associated with the promotion of apoptosis, as indicated by the expression of apoptosis-associated proteins and changes in nuclear morphology. SE appeared to induce the mitochondrial apoptotic cascade, as indicated by a decreased expression of Bcl-2, activation of Bcl-2 associated X protein, release of cytochrome c, decrease in procaspase-3, and an increase in cleaved-poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP). Furthermore, the expression levels of Fas-associated via death domain and cleaved caspase-8 were increased in a SE dose-dependent manner. Taken together, these results suggest that the intrinsic and extrinsic pathways of apoptosis are associated with the anticancer effects of SE on MCF-7 cells. Thus, SE may be a suitable candidate for the treatment and prevention of human breast cancer.
