Memory and behavior depend on the proper transduction of signals in the brain, but the underlying molecular mechanisms remain largely unknown. Coronin 1 is a member of a highly conserved family of proteins, and although its gene lies in a chromosome region associated with neurobehavioral dysfunction in mice and men, it has never been directly ascribed a specific function in the brain. Here we show that coronin 1 plays an important role in cognition and behavior by regulating the cyclic AMP (cAMP) signaling pathway. We find that when cell surface receptors are activated, coronin 1 stimulates cAMP production and activation of protein kinase A. Coronin 1 deficiency resulted in severe functional defects at excitatory synapses. Furthermore, in both mice and humans, deletion or mutation of coronin 1 causes severe neurobehavioral defects, including social deficits, increased aggression, and learning disabilities. Strikingly, treatment with a membrane-permeable analogue of cAMP restored synaptic plasticity and behavioral defects in mice lacking coronin 1. Together this work not only shows a critical role for coronin 1 in neurobehavior but also defines a role for the coronin family in regulating the transmission of signals within cells.
