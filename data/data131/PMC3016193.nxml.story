Tumors of the appendix are rare entities causing mucoceles. The majority of them are discovered incidentally during investigation for other conditions. Laparoscopic surgery for appendiceal tumors is still controversial, as inadvertent rupture of the lesion due to improper handling will cause pseudomyxoma peritonei. The patient was incidentally discovered to have an appendiceal tumor and referred to us for laparoscopy. Because the tumor involved the entire appendix, a laparoscopic right hemicolectomy was performed without directly handling the tumor. Postoperative recovery was uneventful. Pathological diagnosis was low-grade appendiceal mucinous neoplasm. The safety of laparoscopic appendectomy for the management of incidentally discovered appendiceal tumors has not yet been established. Several reports in the literature support both laparoscopic and open surgery. The main concerns to be addressed are the adequacy of resection and intraperitoneal rupture of the tumor. Our patient successfully underwent laparoscopic surgery without any complications. A formal right hemicolectomy was performed because the tumor involved the entire appendix. We now think laparoscopic surgery for appendiceal tumors is safe, feasible, and even may be beneficial.
