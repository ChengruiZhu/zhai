Mathematical models are of fundamental importance in the quantitative verification of biological hypotheses. Muscle contraction models assume the existence of several stable states for the myosin head, whereas the transition rates between states are defined to fit experimental data. The ratio of the forward and backward rates is linked to the ratio of the probabilities of being in one or other stable state at equilibrium through a detailed balance condition. A commonly used assumption leads to a relatively simple expression for this balance condition that depends only on the values of the energy at the minima and not on the minima shape. Mathematically, this hypothesis corresponds to infinite sharpness at these minima; physically, it neglects the small thermal fluctuations within actomyosin stable states. In this work, we compare this classical approach with a model that includes thermal fluctuations within wide minima, and quantitatively assess how much this hypothesis affects the model outcomes at the single molecule, single fiber, and whole heart levels. It is shown that, using parameters compatible with known behavior in muscle mechanics, relaxing the infinitely sharp minima hypothesis improves the predicted force generation and efficiency at the macroscopic level.
