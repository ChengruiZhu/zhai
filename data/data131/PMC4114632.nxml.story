In order to improve the diagnosis and therapy of undifferentiated embryonal liver sarcoma (UELS), the present study presents the case of a 9-year-old female with UELS and discusses UELS in childhood. The patient presented with abdominal pain and fever. The laboratory tests, radiographic examination and pathological features presented by the female were similar to those of typical cases of UELS reported in childhood. The patient initially received surgical treatment and the immunohistochemical findings suggested that the patient had UELS. The patientâ€™s parents refused adjuvant chemotherapy and demonstrated a right prerenal mass 6 months post-surgery. Microscopic examination revealed that the tumor was evidence of undifferentiated embryonal sarcoma recurrence. However, the patient was comfortable and physical examination revealed no abnormal conditions. In addition, the laboratory results were normal. Abdominal computed tomography scan and ultrasound were performed every 3 months to monitor the tumor recurrence. At the time of writing, it has been 6 months after the second surgical procedure and there has been no appearence of abnormalities. Previous studies have shown that patients who receive combined therapy with complete tumor resection and adjuvant chemotherapy have a longer survival time than those who undergo surgical therapy alone. Complete tumor resection combined with adjuvant chemotherapy may reduce the risk of recurrence and enhance the survival time in patients with UELS.
