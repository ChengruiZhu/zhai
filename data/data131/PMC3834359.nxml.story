 concentration-dependent manner and are involved in cellular processes, including apoptosis, proliferation and differentiation. Hypoxia-inducible factor-1α (HIF-1α) has been hypothesized to be critical in the angiogenesis of tumors. We hypothesized that Annexin A3, a member of the Annexin family, and HIF-1α may be associated with each other in colorectal cancer. The expression of Annexin A3 and HIF-1α in 60 colorectal cancer tissues was assessed by immunohistochemistry to statistically analyze the association between the clinicopathological features and survival of these cases. In the present study, 65 and 47% of colorectal cancer specimens were found to show Annexin A3 and HIF-1α immunoreactivity, respectively. Annexin A3 expression was found to significantly correlate with tumor size and Dukes’ stage (all P<0.05). Furthermore, Annexin A3 and HIF-1α protein expression exhibited a similar pattern in these samples, and their expression was found to correlate with poor survival in colorectal cancer patients. The results of the current study indicated for the first time that the increased expression of Annexin A3 in colorectal cancer correlates significantly with tumor growth and poor prognosis. Furthermore, Annexin A3 has been found to correlate with HIF-1α expression. These observations highlight an improved understanding of the carcinogenesis of colorectal cancer.
