Para-acetabular insufficiency fractures are rare and exceedingly difficult to diagnose without a high index of suspicion, since the images mimic those of bone tumors. We herein present the case of a 55-year-old woman who suffered from hip pain with subacute onset. She had undergone a hysterectomy-ovariectomy due to endometriosis when she was 41 years old. Her bone mineral density was normal due to supplemental treatment with female hormones. About 3 months after onset, she was referred to our institute with a diagnosis of pelvic bone tumor. Plain radiographs and computed tomography showed irregular osteosclerosis in the para-acetabulum. Bone scintigraphy demonstrated uptake in the para-acetabulum. Magnetic resonance imaging showed abnormal signal with low-signal intensity on T1-weighted images and high-signal intensity on T2-weighted images throughout the entire hemipelvic bone. Since the pain continued for more than 3 months, open biopsy was undertaken and the lesion was found to be non-neoplastic. Six months after onset, the pain disappeared. The clinical course suggested a diagnosis of insufficiency fracture in the para-acetabulum. Para-acetabular insufficiency fractures should always be considered in cases of hip pain, even in patients with prolonged symptoms.
