Individual organisms of identical genetic background, living in a homogeneous constant environment, may nonetheless exhibit observable differences dubbed phenotypic plasticity or variability. When such a population is challenged with an unforeseen stress, the disparity among individuals may increase, yielding different strategies in response. This work addresses the occurrence and propagation of phenotypic variation as it affects bacterial survival in response to mild antibiotic treatments. We recorded images of single bacterial cells as they divide prior to and during exposure to a sub-lethal level of streptomycin, a ribosome-targeted antibiotic. We found that individual differences increase upon stress to the extent that cells may either die or survive the treatment. Differentiation events were traced back prior to exposure. We suggest that a positive feedback loop, governed by increased membrane permeability, underlies the transient cell memory observed. Cells with relatively high basal stress-response levels prior to stress are not primed for better survival, but are rather more likely to succumb to antibiotic treatment. As pathogens commonly encounter sub-lethal doses of antibiotics, their survival may be better understood in light of this study.
