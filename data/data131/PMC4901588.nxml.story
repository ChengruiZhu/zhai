Sheep with PLLA grafts were fully functional post-op; autograft sheep exhibited early morbidity. There was no evidence of synovitis, serology and gross findings were normal. Micro CT, radiographs, MRI, and histology indicated resorption of PLLA grafts and regeneration of the ACL at 12 months. Intra articular histology of PLLA- and auto- grafts showed neo-ligamentization at 3 months, increased collagenous deposition and cellularity with time, a reconstituted ACL at 1 year, and continued maturation. Intra-articularly, PLLA grafts were intact at 6 weeks, and 3 & 6 months, and nearly fully resorbed at 1 year. Histology in the tibial bone tunnel (6 - 48 months) showed the PLLA graft between the screw and aperture filled with new collagenous tissue and tendon-bone healing. At 18, 24, and 48 months, PLLA grafts were intact and encapsulated by bone. Pathology of lymph nodes and organs indicated occasional presence of PLLA particulate. Histology and pathology yielded no adverse findings locally, systemically, or functionally. Biomechanical testing of BLB complexes with inside-out screw fixation on the femur (1) was found to impede healing and function of the PLLA graft. Testing of sheep with suspension fixation (3) showed PLLA grafts to bear a load of 423N (n=6, SD 119N) at 6 weeks, 491N (n=5, SD 116N) at 6 months, and 386N (n=6, SD 220N) at 12 months. In comparison, autograft at 6 weeks, 6 months, and 12 months failed at 111N (n=5, SD 40N), 526N (n=3, SD 185N), and 525N (n=5, SD 171N), respectively. Outside-in fixation for the tibia and femur (2) showed the PLLA graft to bear loads at 6 and 12 months of 320N (n=6, SD 142N) and 601N (n=6, SD 186N). Autograft failed at loads of 358N (n=1) and 422N (n=3, SD 164N).
