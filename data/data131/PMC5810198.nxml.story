Endothelial senescence leads to cell dysfunction, which in turn eventually results in cardiovascular disease. Identifying factors that regulate endothelial senescence may provide insight into the pathogenesis of aging. Insulin-like growth factor (IGF) signaling has a significant role in the physiology of endothelial cells (ECs). Overactivation of IGF signaling has been implicated in promoting the aging process. Lectin-like oxidized low-density lipoprotein (oxLDL) receptor-1 (LOX-1) is a scavenger receptor that mediates the internalization of oxLDL into cells. Previous studies by our group have indicated that microRNA let-7g exerts an anti-aging effect on ECs and also suppresses LOX-1 expression. Since LOX-1 also induces the aging process, the present study we explored whether let-7g still exerts an anti-aging effect on ECs when LOX-1 is suppressed. Angiotensin II (Ang II) was used to induce senescence in ECs. It was revealed that Ang II significantly increased the expression of aging markers, including β-galactosidase, LOX-1, IGF1 and its receptor IGF1R. On the contrary, Ang II decreased the expression of the anti-aging gene sirtuin 1 (SIRT1). When LOX-1 was knocked down by small interfering RNA, let-7g still dose-dependently decreased the expression of β-galactosidase (β-gal), LOX-1, IGF1 and IGF1R, and SIRT1 was still upregulated. Using senescence-associated β-gal staining, it was confirmed that let-7g exerts a LOX-1-independent anti-aging effect on ECs. In conclusion, the present study demonstrated that let-7g has an anti-aging effect regardless of the presence or absence of LOX-1.
