We used The Cochrane systematic review methodology with meta-analyses and trial sequential analyses of randomized trials comparing the effects of cognitive therapy versus ‘no intervention’ for major depressive disorder. Participants had to be older than 17 years with a primary diagnosis of major depressive disorder to be eligible. Altogether, we included 12 trials randomizing a total of 669 participants. All 12 trials had high risk of bias. Meta-analysis on the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression showed that cognitive therapy significantly reduced depressive symptoms (four trials; mean difference −3.05 (95% confidence interval (Cl), −5.23 to −0.87; P<0.006)) compared with ‘no intervention’. Trial sequential analysis could not confirm this result. Meta-analysis on the Beck Depression Inventory showed that cognitive therapy significantly reduced depressive symptoms (eight trials; mean difference on −4.86 (95% CI −6.44 to −3.28; P = 0.00001)). Trial sequential analysis on these data confirmed the result. Only a few trials reported on ‘no remission’, suicide inclination, suicide attempts, suicides, and adverse events without significant differences between the compared intervention groups.
