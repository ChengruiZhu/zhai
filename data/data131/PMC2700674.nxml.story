This is a case report of a 32-year-old woman, being treated for secondary infertility, with history of previous ectopic pregnancy, who presented to the emergency obstetrical room in a state of hypovolemic shock. A diagnosis of ruptured ectopic pregnancy was confirmed in view of history of 14 weeks amenorrhea with a positive urine pregnancy test and positive colpopunture. She was immediately shifted for an emergency exploratory laparotomy. Intraoperatively, the authors were surprised to encounter a right lateral wall rupture uterus and ~14 weeks foetus with the placenta lying freely in the peritoneal cavity. That was suggestive of a right interstitial ectopic which had grown up to 14 weeks, invaded the uterine cavity thus forming an angular ectopic, which ended up as the catastrophic event. The authors here wish to highlight that angular pregnancy is rare but it has catastrophic consequences including maternal mortality. Had the patient presented early, in view of history of previous ectopic, an ultrasonography and color Doppler would have been useful in early detection. And a fertility conserving management in the form of Methotrexate therapy or Selective Uterine artery embolization could have been done.
