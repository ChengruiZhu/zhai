Pulmonary vein leiomyosarcoma is extremely rare and has a poor prognosis. Surgical resection with a wide margin seems to offer the only chance of cure. The role of adjuvant therapy is controversial, and the exact efficacy of chemotherapy has not been observed. In this report, we present an 18-year-old male patient with pulmonary vein leiomyosarcoma in whom the use of paclitaxel (PAX) proved to be effective. Because the tumor originated from the left superior pulmonary vein and diffused into the left atrial wall and the junction of the right superior pulmonary vein and left atrium, the en bloc excision of the tumor was impossible. The first-line chemotherapy, including ifosfamide, doxorubicin, and dacarbazine, in conjugation with radiation therapy could not demonstrate any effect on the tumor size. However, the following PAX-containing regimen provided complete regression of the tumor. After PAX-based high-dose chemotherapy with autologous peripheral blood stem cell transplantation, the patient showed complete remission for 2 years. Although he suffered metastatic recurrences and died 4 years after the onset of symptoms, our patient's clinical course clearly reveals the efficacy of PAX.
