We conducted a study comparing B‐mode acquisition and targeting (BAT) ultrasound alignments based on CT data in the postoperative setting. CT scans were obtained with a Primatom CT‐on‐rails on nine patients. Two CT scans were obtained each week, while setup error was minimized by BAT ultrasounds. For the first three patients, a direct comparison was performed. For the next six patients, a template based on the shifts from the week 1 CT during treatment was used for subsequent setup. Comparison of isocenter shifts between the BAT ultrasound and CT was made by the difference, absolute difference, and improvement (using CT alignments as the reference technique). A total of 90 image comparisons were made. The average interfraction motion was 3.2 mm in the lateral, 3.0 mm in the longitudinal, and 5.1 mm in the AP direction. The results suggest that the CT‐based ultrasound templates can improve the localization of the prostate bed when the initial displacements are greater than 4 mm. For initial displacements smaller than 4 mm, the technique neither improved nor worsened target localization. However, ultrasound alignments performed without the use of a template deteriorated patient positioning for two out of three patients, demonstrating that the use of a CT template was beneficial even at small initial displacements.
