 Inoculation of the MCN and Lung-To lines of human cells in continuous culture with Newcastle disease (NDV), mumps, or 6-6 viruses led to slight cytopathic effects (CPE) if the multiplicity of infection exceeded one. On second passage or with smaller initial inocula no CPE became apparent. The viruses multiplied, however, as determined by titrations in HeLa cultures or chick embryos. Indeed, persistently infected sublines of MCN and Lung-To were readily established without resort to special manipulations and some of these have been carried now for over 18 months on the same media and schedules as the uninfected parent strains. The viruses were found to be associated mainly with the cells and only 1, or at most 10 per cent of it was detectable in the media. The titers obtained were always low in relation to the available cell population. Reduction or even omission of the horse serum component in the media or ultraviolet irradiation of the cultures did not increase the yield of virus, and CPE became apparent only when similarly treated, uninfected cultures were, likewise, affected by the manipulations. The persistently infected cultures differed from their uninfected counterparts in that they exhibited (
