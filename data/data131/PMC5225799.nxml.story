This retrospective, observer blinded case-control study aims to compare the prevalence of neurovascular conflicts (NVCs) of the vestibulocochlear nerve and the anterior inferior cerebellar artery (AICA) in patients presenting with clinical signs of acute vestibular neuritis with and without subsequent objective vestibular function loss (VFL). 58 acute cases of clinically suspected acute vestibular neuritis were investigated with same day cranial MRI at a tertiary referral centre and compared to 61 asymptomatic controls. The prevalence of NVCs in cases with objective VFL were also compared to cases without VFL. Radiologists described the NVC as "no contact" (Grade 0), "contact < 2 mm" (Grade 1), "contact > 2 mm" (Grade 2) and "vascular loop presence" (Grade 3) without knowledge of neurotological data. Neurotological data was collected without knowledge of MRI findings. Vestibular function was tested by bithermic caloric irrigation. 26 cases (45%) showed caloric VFL (Group A), whereas 32 (55%) exhibited no VFL (Group B). Group A included 13 cases with NVCs (50%), Group B included 26 NVC cases (82%) (p = 0.012) and the control group included 16 individuals (26%) (p < 0.001 for comparison of all 3 groups). Group B had a significantly higher NVC-Grading than Group A (p = 0.009). There was no statistically significant association between NVCs and either SNHL or tinnitus (p > 0.05). Our results suggest that patients presenting with clinical signs of acute vestibular neuritis who show symmetrical caloric vestibular function test results have a significantly higher NVC prevalence in the cerebellopontine angle.
