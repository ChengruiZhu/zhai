The Golgi-associated PDZ- and coiled-coil motif-containing (GOPC) protein controls the intracellular trafficking of numerous integral membrane proteins. Knockdown of GOPC increases activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase-extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 pathway and cancer cell progression in colorectal cancer. The present study aimed to clarify the correlation between GOPC expression and prognosis in colorectal cancer. Total RNA was extracted from 153 clinical colorectal cancer specimens and GOPC expression was evaluated using reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction. The correlation between GOPC expression and clinicopathological factors was analyzed, along with the association of GOPC expression with overall survival (OS) and with recurrence-free survival (RFS). Lower expression of GOPC was significantly associated with a high frequency of venous invasion (P=0.001) and to poorer OS and RFS based on Kaplan-Meier analysis. In addition, multivariate analyses using a Cox proportional hazards model identified lower expression of GOPC to be an independent prognostic factor for colorectal cancer (hazard ratio=2.800; 95% confidence interval; 1.121â€“7.648; P=0.027). Lower expression of GOPC revealed a high frequency of venous invasion and associated with poorer prognosis for patients with colorectal cancer.
