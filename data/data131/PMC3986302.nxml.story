p28 is an anionic, amphipathic, cell-penetrating peptide derived from the cupredoxin azurin that binds to the DNA-binding domain (DBD) of the tumor suppressor protein, p53, and induces a post-translational increase in the level of wild type and mutated p53 in a wide variety of human cancer cells. As p63 and p73, additional members of the p53 superfamily of proteins, also appear to be involved in the cellular response to cancer therapy and are reportedly required for p53-induced apoptosis, we asked whether p28 also binds to p63 and p73. Atomic force spectroscopy demonstrates that p28 forms a stable, high-affinity complex with full-length p63, the DBD of p63, and full-length p73. Exposure to p28 decreased the level of TAp63α and ΔNp63α, the truncated form of p63, in p53 wild type and mutated human breast cancer cells, respectively. p28 increased the level of TAp73α, but not ΔNp73α, in the same breast cancer cell lines. In contrast, p28 increased the level of the TA and ΔN isoforms of p63 in p53 wild type, but not in p53 mutated melanoma cells, while decreasing TA p73α in p53 wild type and mutated human melanoma cells. All changes were mirrored by an associated change in the expression of the HECT E3 ligases Itch/AIP4, AIP5, and the RING E3 ligase Pirh2, but not in the receptor for activated C kinase or the RING E3 ligases Mdm2 and Cop1. Collectively, the data suggest that molecules such as p28 bind with high affinity to the DBD of p63 and p73 and alter their expression independent of the Mdm2 and Cop1 pathways.
