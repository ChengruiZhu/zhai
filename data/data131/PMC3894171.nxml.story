RNA polymerase II (Pol II) is a molecular machine that is responsible for transcribing all protein coding genes in the eukaryotic genome. Transcription by Pol II is a highly regulated process consisting of several rate-limiting steps. During transcription elongation, a number of transcription factors are essential to modulate Pol II activity. One of these factors is the Negative Elongation Factor (NELF), and it plays a major role in promoter-proximal pausing, a widespread phenomenon during early transcription elongation. NELF-E, a protein subunit of the NELF complex contains a conserved RNA binding domain that is thought to regulate transcription through its interaction with newly transcribed RNA made by Pol II. However, the function of the RNA binding activity of NELF-E remains unresolved due to prior conflicting studies. Here, we clarify the RNA binding properties of NELF-E and provide insight into how this protein might facilitate promoter-proximal pausing of Pol II in transcription. Moreover, we identify the precise region of NELF-E binding in one of its known regulatory targets, HIV-1. Taken together, the results presented indicate a dynamic interplay between NELF and specific RNA sequences around the promoter pause region to modulate early transcription elongation.
