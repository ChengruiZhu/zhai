. The upper and lower double-cell co-culture system was established between hUC-MSCs and HSCs in the experimental group. HSCs were cultured alone as a negative control group. Cell proliferation and apoptosis were determined by 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay and flow cytometry, respectively. Cell supernatants were harvested to determine the concentration of transforming growth factor-β1 (TGF-β1) by ELISA. mRNA and protein of TGF-β1, Smad3 and Smad7 in HSCs were determined by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction and western blotting, respectively. In the co-culture group, the proliferation of HSCs was significantly inhibited compared with the negative control group at 24 and 48 h (p<0.05). Apoptosis of HSCs in the co-culture group increased compared with that in the negative control group, which was more obvious at 48 h (p<0.05). The concentration of TGF-β1 in the co-culture group was significantly lower than in the HSCs cultured alone (p<0.05). After HSCs were co-cultured with hUC-MSCs for 48 h, expression of TGF-β1 and Smad3 mRNA and protein was reduced and expression of Smad7 mRNA and protein was increased compared with the negative control group (p<0.05). hUC-MSCs inhibited proliferation of HSCs, possibly through inhibiting TGF-β1 and Smad3 expression and increasing Smad7 protein expression.
