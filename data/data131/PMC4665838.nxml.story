In the present study, the case of a 51-year-old female with a metastatic tumor in the left kidney originating from cervical carcinoma, is reported. The patient had undergone chemoradiotherapy for stage IIB squamous-cell carcinoma of the uterine cervix 3 years earlier. Computed tomography (CT) identified low-density left renal nodules, which were diagnosed post-operatively as renal cysts during the follow-up conducted 2 years later. The next year, the patient was admitted to the Hunan Provincial Tumor Hospital (The Affiliated Tumor Hospital of Xiangya Medical College, Central South University, Changsha, Hunan, China) with a fever of unknown origin, left-sided flank pain and hematuria. CT examination detected irregular low-density nodules in the left kidney and heterogeneous enhancement on enhanced CT. Subsequently, the patient was subjected to a nephrectomy. Post-surgical analysis of subsequent biopsies indicated kidney tumor metastasis originating from cervical carcinoma. Renal metastases are rare in patients with cervical carcinoma. The present study reported a case of renal metastasis originating from cervical carcinoma and also reviewed previous case reports on patients presenting with this unusual type of cancer.
