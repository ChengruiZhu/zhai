The G protein-coupled light-sensitive receptor melanopsin is involved in non-image-forming light responses including circadian timing. The predicted secondary structure of melanopsin indicates a long cytoplasmic tail with many potential phosphorylation sites. Using bioinformatics, we identified a number of amino acids with a high probability of being phosphorylated. We generated antibodies against melanopsin phosphorylated at Ser-381 and Ser-398, respectively. The antibody specificity was verified by immunoblotting and immunohistochemical staining of HEK-293 cells expressing rat melanopsin mutated in Ser-381 or Ser-398. Using the antibody recognizing phospho-Ser-381 melanopsin, we demonstrated by immunoblotting and immunohistochemical staining in HEK-293 cells expressing rat melanopsin that the receptor is phosphorylated in this position during the dark and dephosphorylated when light is turned on. On the contrary, we found that melanopsin at Ser-398 was unphosphorylated in the dark and became phosphorylated after light stimulation. The light-induced changes in phosphorylation at both Ser-381 and Ser-398 were rapid and lasted throughout the 4-h experimental period. Furthermore, phosphorylation at Ser-381 and Ser-398 was independent of each other. The changes in phosphorylation were confirmed
