Carbon monoxide (CO) can act as an anti-inflammatory effector in mouse models of lung injury and disease, through the downregulation of pro-inflammatory cytokines production, though the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. The nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain-, leucine-rich region-, and pyrin domain-containing-3 (NLRP3) inflammasome is a protein complex that regulates the maturation and secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines, including interleukin-1β (IL-1β). In this report, we show that the CO-releasing molecule (CORM-2) can stimulate the expression of pyrin, a negative regulator of the NLRP3 inflammasome. CORM-2 increased the transcription of pyrin in the human leukemic cell line (THP-1) in the absence and presence of lipopolysaccharide (LPS). In THP-1 cells, CORM-2 treatment dose-dependently reduced the activation of caspase-1 and the secretion of IL-1β, and increased the levels of IL-10, in response to LPS and adenosine 5′-triphosphate (ATP), an NLRP3 inflammasome activation model. Genetic interference of IL-10 by small interfering RNA (siRNA) reduced the effectiveness of CORM-2 in inhibiting IL-1β production and in inducing pyrin expression. Genetic interference of pyrin by siRNA increased IL-1β production in response to LPS and ATP, and reversed CORM-2-dependent inhibition of caspase-1 activation. CO inhalation (250 ppm)
