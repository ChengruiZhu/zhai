Genome-wide association study has been a productive approach to studying human complex diseases in the past decade, yet challenges still remain in both identifying and interpreting disease-associated loci. In our previous work, we showed that integrated analysis of GWAS summary statistics and genomic functional annotations could enhance the performance of signal prioritization. In this paper, we further improve our annotation through integrating a rich collection of epigenomic data from the Roadmap Epigenomics Project. We introduce GenoSkyline, a statistical framework to predict tissue-specific functional regions in the human genome, and demonstrate its ability to capture tissue-specific functionality through extensive case studies. We then illustrate a variety of ways that GenoSkyline could benefit post-GWAS analysis. The performance of signal prioritization is further improved using annotations of disease-related tissue types. Furthermore, combining GenoSkyline annotations with GWAS results allow us to partition heritability by tissue types and generate new hypotheses regarding the disease etiology behind each risk locus, thereby providing novel biological insights to many human complex diseases. GenoSkyline is powerful, robust, and customizable. We believe that GenoSkyline and its applications can guide genetics research at multiple resolutions and greatly benefit the broader scientific community.
