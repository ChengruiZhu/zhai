Previous studies have reported inconsistent results regarding the association between homocysteine (Hcy) levels and calcific aortic valve disease (CAVD). We investigate the association between Hcy levels in patients with CAVD and controls by conducting a systematic review and meta-analysis. We conducted a systematic search of studies published prior to the end of March 2017 in the PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials and the Chinese Biomedical Literature databases. Eligible studies evaluating plasma Hcy levels in CAVD patients and controls were identified by two independent investigators. Standardized mean difference (SMD) and the corresponding 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) were estimated using the random-effects model. Ten studies involving 6349 participants were included. Pooled analysis demonstrated that Hcy levels were significantly elevated in patients with CAVD compared with controls (pooled SMD: 0.57, 95% CI: 0.36â€“0.79). This elevation was more obvious in American and Asian populations than in Turkish populations. Furthermore, Hcy levels were significantly elevated in patients with mild-to-moderate CAVD and severe CAVD. Our results demonstrate that CAVD is associated with elevated Hcy levels.
