Older patients are not considered good candidates to undergo more challenging therapeutic treatments, e.g. highly invasive surgery and complex chemotherapy. However, their exclusion from standard therapeutic options is not justifiable. Herein, we reviewed 212 patients aged â‰¥ 70, affected with laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma, and treated with transoral laser microsurgery or open neck (partial / total) laryngectomy with radical intent. The main aim was to compare patient outcomes to identify predictive factors that can be used by surgeons to choose the most appropriate treatment option. In our cohort, patients affected with more advanced tumour and hence treated by invasive open neck surgeries (above all TL) are more prone to develop complications and undergo fatal outcome than those with early disease treated by laser microsurgery, independently of age at surgery. In conclusion, elderly patients affected by laryngeal cancer can be treated similarly to younger patients, keeping in mind that more invasive surgeries are associated with a higher risk of developing complications. The advantages of mini-invasive surgery make it a possible first choice treatment in very old and frail patients suffering from laryngeal cancer, especially considering the recent success in treatment of some advanced stage tumours. Furthermore, comorbidities, by themselves, should not be used as exclusion criteria for subjecting an elderly patient to a different treatment that is from standard therapy.
