Preoperative chemoradiotherapy (pre-CRT) has been represented as the standard treatment for locally advanced rectal cancer (LARC), but large variations of tumor radiation response to CRT have been reported in the clinic. To explore the function of microRNAs as potential therapeutic predictors of pre-CRT pathological response in LARC, we analyzed global miRNA expression in CRT-sensitive and CRT-resistant groups before treatment. MiR-345 was significantly elevated in the CRT-resistant group. Therefore, miR-345 was selected as a candidate for further analysis. We assessed the correlation between the miRNA signatures and the chemoradiotherapeutic response in 20 randomly selected LARC tissue samples (Validation set) and 87 serum samples (Training set) by qRT-PCR. Further, we validated the results in 42 randomly selected LARC serum samples (Validation set). High miR-345 expression was significantly correlated with unfavorable pre-CRT pathological response in tissue and serum. Moreover, low miR-345 levels predicted superior 3-year local recurrence free survival (LRFS). Taken together, circulating serum miR-345 correlates with unfavorable pre-CRT response and poor locoregional control in LARC. It might be a promising biomarker to facilitate patient stratification for personalized treatment.
