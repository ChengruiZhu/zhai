 systematic biology has attempted to classify species into “family trees.” Genomics has provided a new framework permitting descriptions of sibling relations between species on the basis of their complete genetic blueprints. While trees based on single genes (rRNA), or limited numbers of genes have been useful, genome trees derived from complete genome comparisons should lead to more complete pictures of phylogenetic relations between various organisms. In order to reach such a global vision, procedures to establish sibling relationships should depend on an overall comparison that captures the evolutionary fates of proteins jointly in multiple genomes. This paper aims to establish a methodological basis to use genuine multidimensional procedures in the construction of genome trees. This approach completes the derivation of trees based on more classical techniques of pair-wise comparison between species. The authors survey classification schemes emerging from this approach, which either supports traditional views, such as the separation between the three phylogenetic domains Bacteria, Archaea, and Eukarya, or challenges them by suggesting, for example, intermingled clusterings of Proteobacteria with various other bacterial species.
