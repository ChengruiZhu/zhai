Nonlinearity in the infection incidence is one of the main components that shape seasonal epidemics. Here, we revisit classical incidence and propose a first principles derivation of the infection incidence rate. A qualitative analysis of the SIRS model with both the classical and the proposed incidence rate showed that the new model is physically more meaningful. We conducted a statistical analysis confronting the SIRS and SEIR models formulated using both incidence rate functions with four data sets of seasonal childhood epidemics. Two data sets were hospital records of cases of syncytial respiratory virus (RSV). The other two data sets were taken from the well-known UK measles epidemics database. We found that seasonal epidemics is better explained using our incidence rate model embedded in a Poisson sampling process. The results presented here are not by any means an exhaustive exploration of the interplay between nonlinear dynamics and stochasticity. Our results may be viewed as the starting point of multiple research avenues. Three such research topics could be: the first-principles derivation of non-linear incidence rate functions, the role of bistability and demographic stochasticity for disease persistence and the simulation of environmental and demographic stochasticity in the Poincar√© map.
