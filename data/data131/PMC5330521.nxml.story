, far from their physiological context. Nowadays, thanks to the wealth of structural data available and to technological and methodological advances, the interest of the research community is gradually shifting from pure structural determination towards the study of functional aspects of biomolecules. Therefore, a cellular structural approach is ideally needed to characterize biological molecules, such as proteins, in their native cellular environment and the functional processes that they are involved in. In-cell NMR is a new application of high-resolution nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy that allows structural and dynamical features of proteins and other macromolecules to be analyzed directly in living cells. Owing to its challenging nature, this methodology has shown slow, but steady, development over the past 15 years. To date, several in-cell NMR approaches have been successfully applied to both bacterial and eukaryotic cells, including several human cell lines, and important structural and functional aspects have been elucidated. In this topical review, the major advances of in-cell NMR are summarized, with a special focus on recent developments in eukaryotic and mammalian cells.
