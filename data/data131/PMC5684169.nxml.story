Recent years, multiple studies regarding clinical efficacy and risks of Warfarin therapy in dialysis patients have been reported, and not a few reports conclude that clinical advantage of Warfarin is questionable in dialysis patients. Conversely, its hemorrhagic risk might be a little more serious in dialysis patients comparing to non-dialysis patients. Basically, it is assumed that long-term administration of Warfarin accelerates the development of vascular athelosclerosis because of the abolished anti-calcification effect of Gla-protein activation by decreased vitamin K activity. This assumption is recently confirmed by multiple reports, suggesting that the Warfarin administration might be worse harmful than ever expected in dialysis patients who are essentially considered to have higher risk of calcification comparing to non-dialysis patients. In addition, it is recently well considered that the Warfarin administration would be a risk factor to cause Warfarin skin necrosis or calciphylaxis, therapy resistant ulcerative skin lesions, which are considered to be highly related to the Warfarin-induced transient hypercoagulable state or acceleration of calcification. Therefore, it is considered that the indication of Warfarin administration to dialysis patients should be carefully assessed. (This is a translation of Jpn J Vasc Surg 2017; 26: 83â€“90.)
