DNA double-strand breaks occur during metabolism, DNA replication and by exposure to exogenous sources such as ionising radiation. When the genome is inflicted with this type of damage, DNA repair machinery is promoted to restore genome structure. The efficient interplay between DNA damage and repair is crucial to genome stability because the choice of repair mechanism directly affects the probability of mutation. Multiple mechanisms of DNA repair are known to exist, however, the subtleties of how they are activated and their interactions are yet to be fully determined. We hypothesise that a combination of Bayesian statistics and mathematical modeling is essential to elucidate the network dynamics. Studies in the literature have presented time series data of double-strand break repair in wild type and mutant cells. By combining existing time series data, our modeling approach can quantify the differences in activation amongst mutants and in addition identify a number of novel insights into the dynamics of the competing mechanisms. We conclude that alternative mechanisms of repair exhibit variable dynamics dependent on the levels of individual recruitment proteins of the predominant repair pathways.
