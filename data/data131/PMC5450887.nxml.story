Implant-supported removable dental prostheses may be supported by a variety of splinted (bar and clip) attachment systems or nonsplinted abutment-based attachments (ball, magnets, and resilient stud attachments such as locators [Zest Anchors], ERA [Sterngold], and nonresilient-stud attachments such as ANKYLOS SynCone [Dentsply Implants]). Nonsplinted attachments are preferred as they are more economical, less technique sensitive, easier to clean, repair, and maintain than splinted (bar and clip) attachment systems, but they work favorably only when implants in the arch are placed parallel to each other. Often implants in the anterior maxilla have to be placed with a labial inclination (due to the proclination of the premaxilla), resulting in lack of parallelism between the anterior and posterior implants, making it challenging to fabricate a removable dental prostheses supported by nonsplinted attachments, and necessitating the use of angled abutments. Recently, a novel implant design with a 12Â° restorative platform angulation has been introduced by Southern Implants (Co-axis, Keystone Dental, Inc., Burlington, MA, USA). These new angulated implants aid in minimizing the divergence between the anterior and posterior maxillary implants without using angled abutments. The purpose of this article was to report a case utilizing the novel angulated implants (Co-axis, Keystone Dental, Inc., Burlington, MA, USA) in the premaxilla for fabrication of maxillary removable dental prostheses supported and retained by nonsplinted attachments.
