 mutated in ceramide kinase, an enzyme involved in metabolizing ceramide to understand how an organism adapts to stress imposed by ceramide. We find that in the mutants, increased ceramide decreases energy production via mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation. The mutants compensate for decreased energy by upregulating glycolysis, a central pathway of intermediary metabolism. Another important mechanism that is activated in these ceramide kinase mutants is lipolysis, which is involved in breakdown of triglycerides for energy contribution. The mutants show increased hydrolysis of triglycerides in the gut, probably to provide sufficient energy for optimal performance of the heart, a high energy demanding organ. The upregulation of these pathways in the mutant result from increased activation of AKT and decreased FOXO. The modulation of glycolysis and lipolysis by AKT/FOXO is mediated by novel targets identified in this study. Failure of these adaptive mechanisms in aging flies lead to triglyceride accumulation, cardiac abnormalities, and ultimately a decrease in the lifespan of the mutant animals. The mechanisms identified here could have clinical implications in diseases associated with ceramide such as diabetes and obesity.
