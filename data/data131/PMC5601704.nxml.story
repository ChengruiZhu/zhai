Endoscopic treatment for early colorectal cancer closely correlates with patient prognosis. However, endoscopic differentiation between carcinomas and non-neoplastic lesions remains difficult. Here, we topically stained colorectal neoplasms with a fatty acid analogue (BODIPY-FA) and quantified the fluorescent signals using confocal laser endomicroscopy (CLE) and fluorescence microscopy. We also analyzed protein expression in colorectal cancer tissues. We found that expression of fatty acid synthase was elevated, while the expression of fatty acid transporters was reduced in colorectal cancer. In colorectal cancer mouse models and patients, the BODIPY-FA signals were higher in normal epithelia than in carcinomas or colonic intraepithelial neoplasias. BODIPY-FA staining revealed both the arrangement of intestinal glands and the intracellular structures under CLE screening. In a double-blind trial, CLE images stained with BODIPY-FA exhibited greater consistency (κ = 0.68) and overall validity (74.65%) than those stained using intravenous fluorescein sodium (κ = 0.43, 55.88%) when the results were compared with histological diagnoses. These findings suggest that topical use of BODIPY-FA with CLE is a promising imaging approach for early colorectal neoplasm screening.
