Classically, cell signaling is based on the secretion of molecules that bind cell surface receptors. Lipophilic agents can do without cell-surface receptors due to their ability to diffuse through the plasma membrane, but this is normally not the case for proteins, which cannot pass the membrane barrier. However, homeoprotein transcription factors represent an exception as they are secreted and internalized by live cells owing to two peptidic domains. An important illustration of this novel signaling mechanism is provided by Otx2, a homeoprotein that travels from the choroid plexus to specific inhibitory neurons in the cerebral cortex, where it regulates physiological plasticity throughout life. Because the two transfer peptides are in the DNA-binding domain of Otx2, it is impossible to mutate them without altering both cell signaling and cell-autonomous functions. We have therefore developed a mouse in which a secreted anti-Otx2 single-chain antibody can be induced to trap extracellular Otx2 while leaving its cell autonomous function untouched. We show that neutralizing extracellular Otx2 modifies the expression of plasticity genes in the visual cortex, thus providing the first genetic demonstration for homeoprotein signaling in a mammal.
