 and at intervals after transfer to a medium with excess unlabeled thymidine, indicated that the intracellular pool of labeled precursors was diluted within less than a minute so that further labeling would not be detected. The chromosomes labeled during the contact period retained their precise pattern of labeling through another duplication cycle and no turnover of DNA or loss of tritium was detectable. Five or 6 chromosomes of the complement have segments typically late in duplication. Two of these are the X and Y chromosomes. The long arm of the X chromosome and the whole Y chromosome are duplicated in the last half of the interval of DNA synthesis. The short arm of the X chromosome in a male strain is duplicated in the first half of the interval. In another strain (female), one X chromosome had the same timing, but the other one was all duplicated in the last half of the period of DNA synthesis. The DNA in the short arms of 2 medium sized chromosomes, as well as most of the DNA in 1 or 2 of the smallest chromosomes of the complement was replicated late. The study has led to the hypothesis that various chromosomes or parts of chromosomes have a genetically controlled sequence in duplication which may have some functional significance.
