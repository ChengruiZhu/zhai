The regulatory network between transcription factors, epigenetic cofactors and microRNAs is decisive for normal hematopoiesis. The transcription factor RUNX1 is important for the establishment of a megakaryocytic gene expression program and the concomitant repression of erythroid genes during megakaryocytic differentiation. Gene regulation by RUNX1 is frequently disturbed by mutations and chromosomal translocations, such as the t(8;21) translocation, which gives rise to the leukemogenic RUNX1/ETO fusion protein. We found that RUNX1 regulates microRNAs, which are of importance at the megakaryocytic/erythroid branching point. Specifically, RUNX1 down-regulates expression of the microRNA cluster miR144/451 during megakaryocytic differentiation by changing the epigenetic histone modification pattern at the locus. We could show that miR451, one of the micorRNAs of the miR144/451 cluster, supports erythroid differentiation. We found that expression of miR451 is repressed by the RUNX1/ETO fusion protein, resulting in up regulation of miR451 target genes. Our data support the notion that RUNX1 suppresses the erythroid gene expression program including the erythroid microRNA miR451 and that the RUNX1/ETO fusion protein interferes with normal gene regulation by RUNX1.
