RIP1 is a serine/threonine kinase, which is involved in apoptosis and necroptosis. In apoptosis, caspase-8 and FADD have an important role. On the other hand, RIP3 is a key molecule in necroptosis. Recently, we reported that eleostearic acid (ESA) elicits caspase-3- and PARP-1-independent cell death, although ESA-treated cells mediate typical apoptotic morphology such as chromatin condensation, plasma membrane blebbing and apoptotic body formation. The activation of caspases, Bax and PARP-1, the cleavage of AIF and the phosphorylation of histone H2AX, all of which are characteristics of typical apoptosis, do not occur in ESA-treated cells. However, the underlying mechanism remains unclear. To clarify the signaling pathways in ESA-mediated apoptosis, we investigated the functions of RIP1, MEK, ERK, as well as AIF. Using an extensive study based on molecular biology, we identified the alternative role of RIP1 in ESA-mediated apoptosis. ESA mediates RIP1-dependent apoptosis in a kinase independent manner. ESA activates serine/threonine phosphatases such as calcineurin, which induces RIP1 dephosphorylation, thereby ERK pathway is activated. Consequently, localization of AIF and ERK in the nucleus, ROS generation and ATP reduction in mitochondria are induced to disrupt mitochondrial cristae, which leads to cell death. Necrostatin (Nec)-1 blocked MEK/ERK phosphorylation and ESA-mediated apoptosis. Nec-1 inactive form (Nec1i) also impaired ESA-mediated apoptosis. Nec1 blocked the interaction of MEK with ERK upon ESA stimulation. Together, these findings provide a new finding that ERK and kinase-independent RIP1 proteins are implicated in atypical ESA-mediated apoptosis.
