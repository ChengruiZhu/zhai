Metabolic syndrome is one of the major factors to increase the incidence of heart failure. In our study, we compared plasma fatty acid compositions among heart failure patients with and without Metabolic syndrome. Fatty acid (FA) composition of plasma phospholipids was analyzed and the activities of desaturase were estimated as the ratio of substrate and product fatty acids in 85 stable heart failure patients. Fatty acid and estimated desaturase activities were further examined for their associations with Metabolic syndrome components. Heart failure patients with Metabolic syndrome showed significant changes in fatty acid composition in comparison to those without Metabolic syndrome, which had a decreased proportion of lauric acid (C12:0) and an increased proportion of dihomo-γ-linolenic acid (C20:3n-6). Also, estimated desaturase activities (D5D and D6D) were closely related to Metabolic syndrome condition among heart failure patients. The content of dihomo-γ-linolenic acid showed positive correlations with BMI, waist circumference, and plasma triglyceride levels. D6D were positively associated with plasma triglyceride levels, whereas D5D showed a negative correlation with plasma triglyceride levels and waist circumferences. The content of dihomo-γ-linolenic acid as well as estimated D6D and D5D were altered in heart failure patients with Metabolic syndrome.
