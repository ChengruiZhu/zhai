While it is widely recognized that DNA patterns vary across world-wide human populations, the primary features that drive these differences are less well understood. As an example, the Ari peoples of Ethiopia are presently socially divided according to occupation, with Ari Blacksmiths marginalised relative to Ari Cultivators. Two competing theories proposed by anthropologists to explain the existence of these occupational groupings suggest very different histories: (i) the Cultivators reflect migrants who moved into the region occupied by ancestors of the Blacksmiths perhaps many thousands of years ago, versus (ii) the Blacksmiths and Cultivators comprised the same ancestral group before the former was marginalised due solely to their trade. Recent genetic studies showed that Blacksmiths and Cultivators are distinguishable by their DNA, and suggested that overall DNA patterns among the two groups were consistent with (i). However, we demonstrate here that interpreting the results of currently popular algorithms that compare DNA is not always straight-forward. Instead we use a variety of analyses to show that (ii) seems a more likely explanation, perhaps illustrating how social marginalisation can lead to groups becoming genetically distinguishable over a relatively short time period.
