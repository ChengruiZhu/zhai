Simvastatin (STT), a 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitor, is widely prescribed for dyslipidemia, whereas fluoxetine (FLX) is the first-choice drug for the treatment of depression and anxiety. A recent report suggests that selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors can interact with the cytochrome P450 3A4 substrate, and another one suggests that STT enhances the antidepressant activity of FLX. However, the data are inconclusive. The present study was designed to explore the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic consequences of coadministration of STT and FLX in experimental animals. For this, Wistar rats weighing 250Â±10 g were divided into four groups, including control, STT (40 mg/kg/day), FLX (20 mg/kg/day), and STT+FLX group, respectively. After the dosing period of 4 weeks, the animals were sacrificed, and the blood and brain samples were collected for the analysis of STT, simvastatin acid (STA), FLX, total cholesterol, triglyceride, high-density lipoprotein (HDL), 5-hydroxytryptamine, dopamine, and hydroxy indole acetic acid. It was found that the coadministration resulted in a significant increase in the bioavailability of STT in the plasma (41.8%) and brain (68.7%) compared to administration of STT alone (
