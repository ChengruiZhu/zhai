S]-amino acids and were treated with a cleavable crosslinking reagent. The cells were lysed in detergent and the lysates were centrifuged at 100,000 × g to isolate crosslinked complexes. Following cleavage of the crosslinks and analysis by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis, it was found that the crosslinker increased the level of various proteins, and particularly actin, in this pellet fraction. However, GAP-43 was not present, suggesting that GAP-43 was not extensively crosslinked to proteins of the cytoskeleton and membrane skeleton and did not sediment with them. GAP-43 also did not sediment with the membrane skeleton following nonionic detergent lysis. Calmodulin, but not actin or other proposed interaction partners, co-immunoprecipitated with GAP-43 from the 100,000 × g supernatant following crosslinker addition to cells or cell lysates. Faint spots at 34 kDa and 60 kDa were also present. Additional GAP-43 was recovered from GAP-43 immunoprecipitation supernatants with anti-calmodulin but not with anti-actin. The results suggest that GAP-43 is not present in complexes with actin or other membrane skeletal or cytoskeletal proteins in these cells, but it is nevertheless possible that a small fraction of the total GAP-43 may interact with other proteins.
