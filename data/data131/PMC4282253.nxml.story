Vitrification method is widely used in oocyte cryopreservation for IVF but the birth rates are lower than that of the fresh oocyte. One of the known main reasons is structural instability of meiotic spindle and chromosome systems of mature oocyte. To get the best way for keeping competence of matured oocytes, we studied the best conditions for vitrification focused on equilibration times. The mature oocytes were underwent vitrification with current popular method and analyzed the survival rates, microtubule stability and DNA integrity. The survival rates of recovered oocyte are almost same between groups and are more than 93%. The structural configuration of meiotic spindle was well kept in 10 min equilibration group and the stability rate was almost same with that of control. The chromosomal breakdown was observed in all experimental groups, but the chromosomal stability was higher in 10 min equilibration group than the other groups. The 10 min equilibration group showed best condition compared with the other groups. Based on these results, the equilibration time is one of the key factors in successful keeping for competence of mature oocyte. Although, more fine analysis about the effects of physical stress on oocyte during vitrification is needed to define the optimal condition, it is suggested that the optimal equilibration time to get competent oocyte in mouse is 10 min. Information acquired this study may provide insight into intracellular structural events occurring in human oocytes after vitrification and application for cryopreservation of human oocyte.
