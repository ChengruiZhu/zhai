The cell cycle is a complex regulatory network that influences not only growth and division, but also other relevant cellular events (e.g. death, productivity, etc.). The development of biologically accurate cell cycle models can help to systematically study mammalian cell cultures. However, the inclusion of segregation in biological systems usually displays a computationally intensive nature. We propose a combined experimental and mathematical framework that allows capturing the heterogeneity in computationally fast and biologically accurate cell cycle models. Using multiparameter flow cytometry a cyclin blueprint is derived to support the model development. Further, the mathematical formulation is reduced to provide a fast solution, allowing its use for sensitivity analysis and model-based parameter estimation. The simulation results are compared to experimental data to test the accuracy and predictive power of the model. This approach can easily be extended to other culture systems, as well as to include further biological detail. The significance of this approach is not limited to industrially relevant cell lines but its application extends to cell cycle relevant systems such as clinical problems (tumours, cancer treatments, etc.).
