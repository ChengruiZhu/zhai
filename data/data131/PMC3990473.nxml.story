The evolution of eukaryotes is characterized by drastic changes in their genome content. Genome expansions have often occurred by duplication of the entire genome. It is generally not know whether organisms gain any adaptive advantage from these mutations. However, they appear to become fixed in response to environmental change. Many interesting whole genome duplications happened long ago in eukaryotic evolutionary history during periods of turbulent genome and species evolution. Genomic data analysis alone cannot resolve the evolutionary mechanisms and consequences of whole genome duplication. Here, we modeled evolution with whole genome duplications in a Virtual Cell model. Simulating populations that undergo a range of different environmental changes we found that next to often increasing fitness directly, whole genome duplications made lineages more evolvable and hence more able to adapt to harsh new environments. Although most duplicates are deleted in subsequent evolution, genes with many interaction partners were retained preferentially, increasing regulatory complexity. Interestingly however, we found that innovation happened most likely in the more loosely connected and less essential genes.
