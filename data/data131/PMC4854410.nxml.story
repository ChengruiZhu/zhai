After a motor skill is learned, the memory undergoes "offline" processing so that improvement occurs even without further practice. Sleep has been shown to enhance this consolidation and, in the process, to reorganize the brain regions involved. However, it remains unclear how sleep does this, and whether different sleep stages have different contributions. One popular idea is that the memory trace is reactivated during slow-wave sleep—a period of sleep characterized by synchronized activity at a slow frequency and high amplitude, as recorded by electroencephalography (EEG)—which drives memory reorganization within the brain. To test this in humans, we took advantage of "targeted memory reactivation," where replay of specific memories is cued by presentation of a sound that was present during learning. After sleep, motor performance was faster for cued memories, suggesting that the trace was consolidated during sleep. Coupled with this, brain activation and connectivity in several motor-learning areas was enhanced for the cued memory. Furthermore, some changes in brain activity were associated with time spent in slow-wave sleep, while others were associated with time spent in rapid-eye movement sleep. These observations provide further insight into sleep's unique role in memory consolidation by showing that offline skill enhancement depends on the reactivation of specific memories, and the associated changes in neural activity may rely upon processing that unfolds across different stages of sleep.
