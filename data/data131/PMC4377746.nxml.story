We treated a 61-year-old man with immunoglobulin (Ig)G4-related kidney disease (IgG4-RKD). He had a history of allergic diseases and an allergic reaction and had received a diagnosis of autoimmune pancreatitis (AIP). He had also received a diagnosis of renal cell carcinoma (RCC) and had undergone segmental resection of the left kidney at 59 years of age. His serum amylase level and number of peripheral eosinophils increased after RCC development. We hypothesized that the RCC may have induced AIP and IgG4-RKD and we therefore examined the excised RCC tissue; typical findings of IgG4-RKD associated with RCC were recognized. We next evaluated the mRNA expression of cytokines in the excised tissues of this case and ten other ordinary RCC cases. In all cases, notable levels of IL-10 mRNA and high levels of TGF-Î² mRNA were seen. Although prominent differences were not observed in the mRNA expression of Th1, Th17 and Treg cytokines in all cases, the present case alone showed increased production of the Th2 cytokines IL-4 and IL-5, which were not detected in ordinary RCC cases. Although the mechanism underlying IgG4-RKD development has not yet been determined, Th2 and Treg cells are thought to play a prominent role in the pathogenesis. It is therefore likely that in this case, the association of these two diseases was not coincidental, and a distinct immune response against RCC may trigger IgG4-RKD development.
