Understanding the pharmacokinetic (PK) and pharmacodynamic (PD) relationship of a therapeutic monoclonal antibody against proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) exhibiting target‐mediated drug disposition (TMDD) is critical for selecting optimal dosing regimens. We describe the PK/PD relationship of evolocumab using a mathematical model that captures evolocumab binding and removal of unbound PCSK9 as well as reduction in circulating low‐density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL‐C). Data were pooled from 2 clinical studies: a single‐dose escalation study in healthy subjects (7‐420 mg SC; n = 44) and a multiple‐dose escalation study in statin‐treated hypercholesterolemic patients (14 mg weekly to 420 mg monthly [QM] SC; n = 57). A TMDD model described the time course of unbound evolocumab concentrations and removal of unbound PCSK9. The estimated linear clearance and volume of evolocumab were 0.256 L/day and 2.66 L, respectively, consistent with other monoclonal antibodies. The time course of LDL‐C reduction was described by an indirect response model with the elimination rate of LDL‐C being modulated by unbound PCSK9. The concentration of unbound PCSK9 associated with half‐maximal inhibition (IC
