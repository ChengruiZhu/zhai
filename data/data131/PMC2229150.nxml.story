The whole cell version of the patch clamp technique was used to identify and characterize voltage-gated Ca2+ channels in enzymatically dissociated bovine adrenal zona fasciculata (AZF) cells. The great majority of cells (84 of 86) expressed only low voltage-activated, rapidly inactivating Ca2+ current with properties of T-type Ca2+ current described in other cells. Voltage-dependent activation of this current was fit by a Boltzmann function raised to an integer power of 4 with a midpoint at -17 mV. Independent estimates of the single channel gating charge obtained from the activation curve and using the "limiting logarithmic potential sensitivity" were 8.1 and 6.8 elementary charges, respectively. Inactivation was a steep function of voltage with a v1/2 of -49.9 mV and a slope factor K of 3.73 mV. The expression of a single Ca2+ channel subtype by AZF cells allowed the voltage-dependent gating and kinetic properties of T current to be studied over a wide range of potentials. Analysis of the gating kinetics of this Ca2+ current indicate that T channel activation, inactivation, deactivation (closing), and reactivation (recovery from inactivation) each include voltage-independent transitions that become rate limiting at extreme voltages. Ca2+ current activated with voltage- dependent sigmoidal kinetics that were described by an m4 model. The activation time constant varied exponentially at test potentials between -30 and +10 mV, approaching a voltage-independent minimum of 1.6 ms. The inactivation time constant (tau i) also decreased exponentially to a minimum of 18.3 ms at potentials positive to 0 mV. T channel closing (deactivation) was faster at more negative voltages; the deactivation time constant (tau d) decreased from 8.14 +/- 0.7 to 0.48 +/- 0.1 ms at potentials between -40 and -150 mV. T channels inactivated by depolarization returned to the closed state along pathways that included two voltage-dependent time constants. tau rec-s ranged from 8.11 to 4.80 s when the recovery potential was varied from - 50 to -90 mV, while tau rec-f decreased from 1.01 to 0.372 s. At potentials negative to -70 mV, both time constants approached minimum values. The low voltage-activated Ca2+ current in AZF cells was blocked by the T channel selective antagonist Ni2+ with an IC50 of 20 microM. At similar concentrations, Ni2+ also blocked cortisol secretion stimulated by adrenocorticotropic hormone. Our results indicate that bovine AZF cells are distinctive among secretory cells in expressing primarily or exclusively T-type Ca2+ channels.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)
