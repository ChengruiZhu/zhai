Human pluripotent stem cells hold great promise for their practical and scientific potentials. To improve understanding of self-renewal and differentiation, we previously reported a defined serum-free medium hESF9 could generate and maintain human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) in serum- and feeder-free culture conditions using retroviral vectors. To avoid the unpredictable side effects associated with retrovirus integration, we report here the successful generation of hiPSCs from dental pulp cells with a non-integrating replication-defective and persistent Sendai virus (SeVdp) vector expressing four key reprogramming genes. We found that hESF9 medium in combination with fibronectin are effective for generating and maintaining hiPSCs with SeVdp (KOSM). Using this system, pluripotent and self-renewing hiPSCs could be easily and stably generated and propagated. With this system, we successfully generated hiPSCs from cleidocranial dysplasia (CCD) caused by a heterozygous germ-line mutation of runt-related protein2 (RUNX2), which has an important role in the differentiation of osteoblasts and maturation of chondrocytes. This is the first report of the establishment of CCD-specific iPSCs. The cartilage in the teratomas of CCD-iPSCs showed abnormalities. These CCD-iPSCs would be beneficial to clarify the molecular mechanism and for development of medical applications. Moreover, it brings new pathophysiological role of RUNX2 in the differentiation of the human chondrocytes and osteocytes.
