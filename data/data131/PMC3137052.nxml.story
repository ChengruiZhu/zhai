-Dimethylsphingosine, an inhibitor of SPHK1 and -2, did not inhibit CS-0777 kinase activity. We purified CS-0777 kinase activity from human RBCs by more than 10,000-fold using ammonium sulfate precipitation and successive chromatography steps, and we identified fructosamine 3-kinase (FN3K) and fructosamine 3-kinase-related protein (FN3K-RP) by mass spectrometry. Incubation of human RBC lysates with 1-deoxy-1-morpholinofructose, a competitive inhibitor of FN3K, inhibited âˆ¼10% of the kinase activity, suggesting FN3K-RP is the principal kinase responsible for activation of CS-0777 in blood. Lysates from HEK293 cells overexpressing FN3K or FN3K-RP resulted in phosphorylation of CS-0777 and structurally related molecules but showed little kinase activity for FTY720 and no kinase activity for sphingosine. Substrate preference was highly correlated among FN3K, FN3K-RP, and rat RBC lysates. FN3K and FN3K-RP are known to phosphorylate sugar moieties on glycosylated proteins, but this is the first report that these enzymes can phosphorylate hydrophobic xenobiotics. Identification of the kinases responsible for CS-0777 activation will permit a better understanding of the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of this promising new drug.
