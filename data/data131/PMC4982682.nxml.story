RNA polymerase (RNAP) III is a multisubunit enzyme that synthesizes large amounts of transfer RNAs and a few other abundant short structural RNAs essential for the proliferation of all eukaryotic cells. To meet this demand, RNAP III must repeatedly initiate and terminate RNA synthesis with high efficiency, up to one million times on each tRNA gene per cell doubling. Much more research has been done on initiation than on termination. We performed a genetic screen focused on Rpc1, the largest RNAP III subunit, after subjecting it to random mutagenesis and identifying single amino acid substitutions that specifically affected its ability to terminate. Over 120 mutations were isolated and mapped onto a recently published, near-atomic resolution structure of RNAP III in synthesis mode. Mutations were concentrated in mobile elements of the active center of the enzyme, the bridge helix and the trigger loop, as well as regions that help recruit the RNA 3' cleavage domain of the C11 subunit which transiently interacts with the active center. The data provide evidence that RNAP III controls termination via its active center. Biochemical characterization demonstrated that a mutant RNAP III synthesizes RNA at a higher rate than wild type and also synthesizes more RNA
