 = 14,836). Multivariate logistic regression was used to explore factors associated with employment and occupation, and to compare survivors to their demographic peers in the general population. Employment status was available for 10,257 survivors. Gender, current age, cancer type, radiotherapy, age at diagnosis and epilepsy were consistently associated with being: employed; unable to work; in managerial or non‐manual occupations. Overall, survivors were less likely to be working than expected (OR (99% CI): 0.89 (0.81–0.98)), and this deficit was greatest for irradiated CNS neoplasm survivors (0.34 (0.28–0.41)). Compared to the general population, survivors were fivefold more likely to be unable to work due to illness/disability; the excess was 15‐fold among CNS neoplasm survivors treated with radiotherapy. Overall survivors were less likely to be in managerial occupations than expected (0.85 (0.77–0.94)). However, bone sarcoma survivors were more likely to be in these occupations than expected (1.37 (1.01–1.85)) and also similarly for non‐manual occupations (1.90 (1.37–2.62)). Survivors of retinoblastoma (1.55 (1.20–2.01)) and ‘other’ neoplasm group (1.62 (1.30–2.03)) were also more likely to be in non‐manual occupations than expected.
