Breast and prostate cancers commonly metastasize to bone. To create more space for their expansion, metastatic tumors activate osteoclasts, the only cells capable of bone destruction. The main osteoclast stimulator is the cytokine RANKL, while osteoprotegerin (OPG) acts as a RANKL inhibitor. Systemic application of OPG leads to a decrease in tumor-associated bone destruction, but surprisingly, OPG produced locally by metastasizing cancer cells can enhance bone destruction and tumor growth. Here, we provide a novel explanation for these apparently contradictory experimental results: the osteolysis-promoting effect of OPG is due to a local reduction in RANKL levels, resulting in a spatial RANKL gradient oriented from tumor towards bone tissue. At low rates of OPG expression by cancer cells, such gradients result in the correct orientation of osteoclast movement and intensified bone resorption. We positively test our hypothesis by means of a partial differential equations model, and further substantiate our results with a meta-analysis of gene expression. Even though developed for the specific problem of bone metastases, our model naturally applies to other systems operating within a geometrically anisotropic environment.
