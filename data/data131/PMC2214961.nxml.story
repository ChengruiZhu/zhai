A method for measuring muscle fiber capacitance using small test pulses applied with the three-microelectrode voltage clamp is presented. Using this method, three membrane potential-dependent changes in capacitance were observed: (a) Capacitance of polarized fibers increased by 5--15% with depolarization from V less then -100 mV to voltages slightly below the contraction threshold. (b) Capacitance of fibers depolarized to -30 mV by 100 mM Rb solution decreased by roughly 8% with further depolarization to about +50 mV and increased with repolarization, exhibiting a maximum increase of about 10% at -80 to -90 mV. (c) Capacitance of fibers depolarized to -15 mV by 100 mM K solution increased by about 19% with further depolarization to +43 mV and decreased by about 23% with repolarization to -62 mV. Effects a and b are attributed to changes in specific membrane capacitance due to voltage-dependent redistribution of mobile charged groups within surface of T-tubule membranes. Effect c is caused by changes in the T- system space constant lambdaT due to the voltage dependence of K conductance (inward rectification). Analysis of c showed that in 100 mM K solution lambdaT congruent to 30 mum when inward rectification was fully activated by hyperpolarization and that the density of inward rectifier channels is about the same in surface and tubular membranes. Fiber internal resistance was found to be independent of voltage, a necessary condition for the interpretation of the capacitance measurements.
