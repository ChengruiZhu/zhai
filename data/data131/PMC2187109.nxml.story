The role of individual H-2I subregion determinants in the activation of H-2I alloantigen-primed mixed leukocyte response suppressor T cells (MLR Ts), as well as their possible expression on stimulator cells required to trigger primed H-2K- or D-specific MLR Ts, was addressed in these studies. Both genetic and serologic studies demonstrated that MLR Ts potentially primed to alloantigens encoded by the entire H-2I region were triggered to MLR Ts factor production only by stimulator cells bearing the priming I-J and/or I-C, but not I-A or I-E alloantigens. The relevant I-J and I-C determinants were demonstrated on a single antigen-presenting cell population that is used in common by independent I-J-specific and I-C-specific MLR Ts. Unexpectedly, the stimulator cell population necessary to trigger MLR Ts primed to class I H-2K or D alloantigens expressed not only the priming class I determinant, but in addition, I-C alloantigens syngeneic with the MLR Ts haplotype. Stimulator populations bearing the appropriate H-2K or D alloantigen but serologically depleted of I-C+ cells or genetically constructed to display MLR Ts-disparate I-C determinants were ineffective stimulators of class I antigen-primed MLR Ts. Thus these data suggest that as allogeneic determinants, I-J- and I-C-encoded molecules are together the major triggering elements for MLR Ts primed to disparate H-2I region determinants. In addition, self-I-C molecule recognition appears to constitute an important feature of the triggering, and by implication, priming process of H-2 class I antigen- specific Ts cells.
