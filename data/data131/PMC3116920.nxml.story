A central question in molecular evolution is how changes in the genetic, structural, and biophysical properties of proteins generate new functions. Ancestral sequence reconstruction (ASR) allows long-extinct proteins to be resurrected and characterized in the laboratory and allows the mechanisms for evolutionary shifts in protein functions to be studied experimentally. We used ASR to study the earliest functions and evolution of the glucocorticoid receptor (GR), a hormone-activated transcription factor and critical regulator of vertebrate physiology. We reconstructed the first GR ancestor and showed that this ancient gene evolved dramatically reduced sensitivity to hormone shortly after its birth by gene duplication some 450 million years ago, a function that persists in GRs to this day. Using site-directed mutagenesis, X-ray crystallography, and computational predictions of protein stability, we found that the shift to reduced GR sensitivity was driven by two large-effect mutations that destabilized the receptor-hormone complex. The combined effect of these mutations is so strong that a third mutation, apparently neutral in the ancestral background, evolved to buffer their degenerative effects. Our results suggest a creative role for mutations that partially degrade protein form and function and highlight the importance of interactions between mutations in evolutionary processes and protein functions.
