From an era where amputation was the only option to the current day function preserving resections and complex reconstructions has been a major advance in the treatment of musculoskeletal sarcomas. The objectives of extremity reconstruction after oncologic resection include providing skeletal stability where necessary, adequate wound coverage to allow early subsequent adjuvant therapy, optimising the aesthetic outcome and preservation of functional capability with early return to function. This article highlights the concepts of surgical margins in oncology, discusses the principles governing safe surgical resection in these tumors and summarises the current modalities and recent developments relevant to reconstruction after limb salvage. The rationale of choice of a particular resection modality and the unique challenges of reconstruction in skeletally immature individuals are also discussed. Striking the right balance between adequate resection, while yet retaining or reconstructing tissue for acceptable function and cosmesis is a difficult task. Complications are not uncommon and patients and their families need to be counseled regarding the potential setbacks that may occur in the course of their eventual road to recovery, Limb salvage entails a well orchestrated effort involving various specialties and better outcomes are likely to be achieved with centralization of expertise at regional centers.
