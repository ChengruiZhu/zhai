Cells proliferate by growth and division, which is supported by different gene groups that are periodically induced at specific times when they are required during the cell cycle. These genes not only need to be induced at the right time but also repressed when they are no longer required; mistakes in gene regulation can lead to problems in cell proliferation and diseases such as cancer. A well-known regulatory complex functions just before cells replicate their DNA to induce genes required for this important transition. We show that in fission yeast this regulatory complex (MBF) induces a gene whose encoded protein (Yox1p) in turn binds to MBF and represses MBF-regulated genes. In the absence of Yox1p, the MBF-regulated genes do not fluctuate during the cell cycle but remain constantly induced. Thus, MBF sets up not only the induction but also the timely repression of its target genes via Yox1p. We also provide a global analysis of all the genes regulated by Yox1p and MBF. Together, our data uncover a new negative control loop, further highlighting the sophistication of gene regulation during the cell cycle, and illustrating regulatory similarities and differences between organisms.
