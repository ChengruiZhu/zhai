Genome-wide scans have revealed multiple genetic regions underlying complex traits. However, the transition from an initial association signal to identifying the functional DNA change(s) has proved challenging. Many of the DNA changes discovered are located outside protein-coding regions and may exert their effects through gene regulation. We screened genetic regions associated with hematological traits in erythroblasts (red blood cells) and megakaryocytes (platelet-producing cells) and mapped sites of open chromatin, which harbor active gene regulatory elements. We investigated a DNA sequence change located within a site of open chromatin at chromosome 7 in megakaryocytes, but not erythroblasts, known to be associated with platelet volume. We showed that this DNA change is functional due to alteration of the binding site of a transcription factor, which regulates the expression of a gene that affects platelet characteristics. Mice lacking this gene revealed significant differences in expression of several important platelet genes compared to wild-type mice. The approach described here can be applied in different cell types to functionally follow-up association signals with many other biological traits by identification of the causative base change and how it affects gene function, thus paving the way to clinical benefit.
