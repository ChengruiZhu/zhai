Two sulphated glycoproteins (sgps) of apparent molecular weight (Mr) 180,000 and 150,000, are synthesized by murine PYS and PF HR9 parietal endoderm and Swiss 3T3 cells. The Mr 150,000 sgp has a similar chemical structure to the sulphated glycoprotein, C, synthesized and laid down in Reichert's membrane by mouse embryo parietal endoderm cells (Hogan, B. L.M., A. Taylor, and A.R. Cooper, 1982, Dev. Biol., 90:210-214). Both the Mr 180,000 and 150,000 sgps are deposited in the detergent- insoluble matrix of cultured cells, but they do not apparently undergo any disulphide-dependent intermolecular interactions and are not precursors or products of each other. They contain asparagine-linked oligosaccharides, but these are not the exclusive sites of sulphate labeling. Antiserum raised against the Mr 150,000 sgp C of Reichert's membranes has been used in an immunohistochemical analysis of rat skin. In early foetal and adult skin the antigen is present only in basement membranes, but transiently before and after birth it is also found throughout the upper part of the dermis. This suggests that 150,000 sgp C is at times synthesized by nonepithelial cells and contributes to the extracellular matrix of mesenchymal tissues.
