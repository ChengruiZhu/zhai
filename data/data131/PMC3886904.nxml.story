Both fungal pathogens and their host plants respond to light, which represents an important environmental cue. Unlike plants using light for energy generation, filamentous fungi use light, or its absence, as a general signal for orientation (night/day, underground/on the surface). Therefore, dependent on the ecological niche of the fungus, light may control the development of reproductive structures (photomorphogenesis), the dispersal of propagules (phototropism of reproductive structures) and the circadian rhythm. As in other organisms, fungi have to protect themselves against the detrimental effects of light, i.e. the damage to macromolecules by emerging singlet oxygen. Adaptive responses are the accumulation of pigments, especially in the reproductive and survival structures such as spores, sclerotia and fruiting bodies. Light is sensed by fungal photoreceptors leading to quick responses on the transcriptional level, and is furthermore considered to result in the accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS). In this study, we provide evidence that an unbalanced ROS homoeostasis (generation outweighs detoxification) caused by the deletion of the light-responsive transcription factor BcLTF1 impairs the ability of the necrotrophic pathogen
