The centromeric histone protein, CENH3, plays an important role in chromosome segregation during mitosis and meiosis. Here we show that single amino acid changes in CENH3, while producing no obvious effect on mitosis or meiosis, affect segregation postzygotically upon outcrossing to plants carrying wild-type centromeres. This results in uniparental inheritance among some progeny, and seed death in a larger fraction of progeny. Interestingly, changes competent to induce haploid in Arabidopsis existed in a TILLING population and in unrelated plant species. Our findings have two major consequences. First, uniparental inheritance facilitates the production of haploid plants that can easily be doubled to produce completely homozygous lines in a single generation. Secondly, our findings suggest that natural variation in CENH3 may result in partial reproductive isolation, because chromosomes of the mutant parent from F1 hybrid progeny are culled during embryonic development, while no reproductive defects are observed in self-pollinated plants. We do not know if the same mutations are haploid-inducing in other species, but uniparental chromosome loss, and the seed abortion that accompanies it results in an outcrossing-specific penalty that could potentially be involved in reproductive isolation.
