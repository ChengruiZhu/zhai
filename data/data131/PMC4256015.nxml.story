The classical theory by Hodgkin and Huxley (HH) describes nerve impulses (spikes) that manifest communication between nerve cells. The underlying mechanism of a single spike is excitability, i.e., a small disturbance triggers a large excursion that reverts without further input to the original state. A spike lasts a 1/1000 second and, even though during this period ions are exchanged across the nerve cell membrane, the change in the corresponding ion concentrations can become significant only in series of such spikes. Under certain pathological conditions, changes in ion concentrations become massive and last minutes to hours before they recover. This establishes a new type of excitability underlying communication failure between nerve cells during migraine and stroke. To clarify this mechanism and to recognize the relevant factors that determine the slow time scales of ion changes, we use an extended version of the classical HH theory. We identify one variable of particular importance, the potassium ion gain or loss through some reservoirs provided by the nerve cell surroundings. We suggest to describe the new excitability as a sequence of two fast processes with constant total ion content separated by two slow processes of ion clearance (loss) and re-uptake (gain).
