Objective: We have previously shown that monocytes/macrophages (MC/Mph) influence neovascularization by extracellular matrix degradation, and by direct incorporation into growing microvessels. To date, neither the phenotype of these cells, nor the stages of their capillary-like conversion were sufficiently characterized. Methods: We isolated mouse peritoneal Mph from transgenic mice expressing fluorescent proteins either ubiquitously, or specifically in the myelocytic lineage. These Mph were embedded in Matrigel which contained fluorescent protease substrates, exposed to an MCP-1 chemotactic gradient, and then examined by confocal microscopy after various intervals. Results: Within 3 hrs after gel embedding, we detected TIMP-1 and MMP-12 dependent proteolysis of the matrix surrounding Mph, mostly in the direction of high concentrations of MCP-1. After 2 days, Mph developed intracellular vacuoles containing degradation product. At 5 days these vacuoles were enlarged and/or fused to generate trans-cellular lumens in approximately 10% of cells or more (depending on animalâ€™s genetic background). At this stage, Mph became tubular, and occasionally organized in three-dimensional structures resembling branched microvessels. Conclusion: Isolated mouse peritoneal Mph penetrate Matrigel and form tunnels
