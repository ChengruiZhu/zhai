The evaluation of match officials’ neuromuscular performance is now an important consideration and the vertical jump test is considered suitable for assessing lower limb power, partly because it is directly related to refereeing. The aim of this study, therefore, was to determine the effect of soccer matches on match officials’ vertical jump performance by assessing various biomechanical variables. Eighteen field referees (FRs) and 36 assistant referees (ARs) who officiated in 18 official matches participated in this study. Before the match, at half time and immediately after the match, officials performed two countermovement jumps. Flight phase time (FT), maximum force production (MFpropulsion), time to production of maximum force (TMFpropulsion), production of maximum power (MP), maximum landing force (MFlanding) and time to stabilization (TTS) were calculated for all jumps. There was a tendency for match officials’ jumping performance to improve after matches than beforehand (FR: effect size (ES) = 0.19 ± 0.36, possibly trivial; AR: ES = 0.07 ± 0.17, likely trivial). There were also likely small and very likely moderate differences between FRs’ MP in pre-match and half-time jumps (ES = 0.46 ± 0.47) and in their pre- and post-match jumps (ES = 0.71 ± 0.48). These results indicate that refereeing soccer matches does not reduce vertical jump performance; the subsequent neuromuscular fatigue is not sufficient to affect landing technique.
