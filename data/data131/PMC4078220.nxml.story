The study was based on 5426 patients from ten family practices, organised into eight a priori exclusive severity groups: (i) no CVD or osteoarthritis (OA) (reference), (ii) index hypertension, ischaemic heart disease (IHD) and heart failure (HF) without OA, (iii) index OA without CVD and (iv) same CVD groups with comorbid OA. The measure of CP physical limitations was Seattle Angina Questionnaire and for SOB physical limitations was the Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire. Adjusted baseline associations between the cohorts and symptom-specific physical limitations were assessed using linear regression methods. In the study population, 1443 (27%) reported CP and 2097 (39%) SOB. CP and SOB physical limitations increased with CVD severity in the index and comorbid groups. Compared with the respective index CVD group, the CP physical limitation scores for comorbid CVD groups with OA were lower by: − 14.7 (95% CI − 21.5, 7.8) for hypertension, − 5.5 (− 10.4, − 0.7) for IHD and − 22.1 (− 31.0, − 6.7) for HF. For SOB physical limitations, comorbid scores were lower by: − 9.2 (− 13.8, − 4.6) for hypertension, − 6.4 (− 11.1, − 1.8) for IHD and − 8.8 (− 19.3, 1.65) for HF.
