α-Catenin is an important molecule involved in the maintenance of cell–cell adhesion and a prognostic marker in cancer since its expression is essential for preventing cancer metastasis. However, the mechanism that leads to the downregulation of α-catenin in cancer progression remains unclear. The present study revealed that lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced NF-κB signaling activation suppressed α-catenin expression and motility in SW620 colorectal cancer (CRC) cells, using real-time polymerase chain reaction, Western blotting, and transwell migration assays. LPS treatment reduced both the mRNA and protein expression of α-catenin and thereby enhanced cell motility. Conversely, incubating cells with an NF-κB inhibitor disrupted these effects. Furthermore, the ectopic expression of p65 alone mimicked the effects of LPS stimulation. In CRC tissues, the presence of enteric bacterial LPS-related neutrophil-enriched foci was correlated with α-catenin downregulation. Collectively, these findings suggest that LPS-induced NF-κB signaling is related to α-catenin suppression and enhanced cell motility in CRC. Therefore, NF-κB is a novel potential therapeutic target for CRC metastasis.
