Fifteen patients met the study criteria with a mean follow up of 12 months (±3). The mean defect size was 217±100 mm. In 11 cases the lesion was in the patella, 3 in the trochlea and one in both patella and trochlea. Mean improvement in preoperative to postoperative score was significant for the IKDC objective score 45.8 (±28) to 73.3 (±24) (p=.009), IKDC pain score 49.1 (±20) to 69.8 (±23) (p=.003), KOOS 53.5 (±21) to 75.5 (±15) (p=.001), IKDC subjective 41.3 (±21.7) to 72.7 (±15) (p=.004). MRI demonstrated only two cases (16%) with graft hypertrophy. There was only one case with a detached graft. Mild and moderate subchondral edema was present in 90% (11 patients) of the cases. At the interface between the repaired tissue and the native cartilage, there were only two cases with a fissure of more than 2mm. Very good (66 to 100%) and good (between 33-66%) cartilage fill was present in 54% of the cases. Mild synovial reaction was present in 58% of the cases. From the 6 patients with T2 mapping, all repairs showed significantly different prolongation of quantitative T2 values in both the superficial and deep components of the repair tissue (47.18 for repair vs 28.3 for native (p=0.005) in the deep area and 58.6 for repair vs 37.4 for native in the superficial area (p=0.02).
