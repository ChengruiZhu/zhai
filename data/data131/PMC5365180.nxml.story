. Aberrant DNA methylation in selected gene promoters has emerged as a new epigenetic pathway in CRC development. CRC screening is the most efficient strategy to reduce death. Specific DNA methylation events occur in multistep carcinogenesis. Epigenetic gene silencing is a causative factor of CRC development. DNA methylations have been extensively examined in stool from CRC and precursor lesions. Many methylated genes have been described in CRC and adenoma, although no definite DNA methylation biomarkers panel has been established. Multiple DNA methylation biomarkers, including secreted frizzled-related protein 2, secreted frizzled-related protein 1, tissue factor pathway inhibitor 2, vimentin, and methylguanine DNA methyltransferase, have been further investigated, and observations have revealed that DNA methylation biomarkers exhibit with high sensitivity and specificity. These markers may also be used to diagnose CRC and adenoma in early stages. Real time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) is sensitive, scalable, specific, reliable, time saving, and cost effective. Stool exfoliated markers provide advantages, including sensitivity and specificity. A stool qPCR methylation test may also be an enhanced tool for CRC and adenoma screening.
