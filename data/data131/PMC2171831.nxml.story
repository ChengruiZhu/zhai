We previously demonstrated that integrin-dependent adhesion activates STAT5A, a well known target of IL-3–mediated signaling. Here, we show that in endothelial cells the active β1 integrin constitutively associates with the unphosphorylated IL-3 receptor (IL-3R) β common subunit. This association is not sufficient for activating downstream signals. Indeed, only upon fibronectin adhesion is Janus Kinase 2 (JAK2) recruited to the β1 integrin–IL-3R complex and triggers IL-3R β common phosphorylation, leading to the formation of docking sites for activated STAT5A. These events are IL-3 independent but require the integrity of the IL-3R β common. IL-3 treatment increases JAK2 activation and STAT5A and STAT5B tyrosine and serine phosphorylation and leads to cell cycle progression in adherent cells. Expression of an inactive STAT5A inhibits cell cycle progression upon IL-3 treatment, identifying integrin-dependent STAT5A activation as a priming event for IL-3–mediated S phase entry. Consistently, overexpression of a constitutive active STAT5A leads to anchorage-independent cell cycle progression. Therefore, these data provide strong evidence that integrin-dependent STAT5A activation controls IL-3–mediated proliferation.
