 model of preclinical cancer therapy. A ROR1-cFab prokaryotic expression vector was constructed from positive fusion cells (splenocytes from mice with high ROR1 immune titers were fused with myeloma cells) after three rounds of sub-clone affinity screening. Then, a variety of assays were employed to assess the binding selectivity and specificity of ROR1-cFab to ROR1 protein. Furthermore, CCK8, flow cytometric apoptosis, wound healing, and Transwell migration assays were used to assess antitumor activity of this newly developed anti-ROR1 antibody in ovarian cancer cells. We demonstrated that ROR1-cFab could specifically bind to ROR1 protein and ROR1-positive ovarian cancer A2780 cells. Functional assays revealed that ROR1-cFab inhibited tumor cell proliferation and migration, as well as inducing apoptosis of ROR1-positive A2780 cells in a dose dependent manner. These effects were not observed in ROR1-negative lose386 cells. In conclusion, ROR1-cFab is a novel anti-ROR1 antibody with a high affinity to ROR1 protein and inhibitory effects on ROR1-positive cells. Future studies will determine whether the ROR1-cFab might be a promising candidate for treatment of ROR1-positive ovarian cancer.
