 The intracellular localization of acid phosphatase in guinea pig testicular interstitial cells was investigated by incubating nonfrozen thick sections of glutaraldehyde-perfused testis in a modified Gomori medium and preparing the tissue for electron microscopy. Lipofuscin pigment granules in these cells contain dense pigment, granular matrix, and often a lipid droplet. Reaction product is seen in the matrix of the pigment granules, and they may therefore be called residual bodies. At least some of the dense pigment appears to be derived from myelin figures and membrane whorls, since suitable intermediates can be seen. Lipid droplets found free in the cytoplasm are another possible source of pigment. In both cases the chemical mechanism is presumed to be autoxidation of unsaturated lipid. Acid phosphatase is present in the inner cisterna of Golgi elements. Enzyme activity also appears in possible autophagic vacuoles bounded by double membranes; the reaction product lies between the membranes. Consideration of the enzyme as a tracer suggests that the autophagic vacuoles are derived from the Golgi complex. Possible stages in the formation of these vacuoles by the inner Golgi cisternae are observed.
