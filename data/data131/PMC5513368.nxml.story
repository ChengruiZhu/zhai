Feline injection-site sarcomas (FISS) are malignant skin tumours of mesenchymal origin, the treatment of which is a challenge for veterinary surgeons. The role of surgery, radiotherapy and chemotherapy in FISS treatment has been studied, and a correlation between “clean” surgical margins and disease-free survival has been shown. In addition, clean surgical margins are one of the most important factors for achieving a low recurrence rate. The most effective method of FISS treatment includes combining radical surgery with pre- or postoperative radiotherapy. Chemotherapy may be used as a palliative method of treatment or may be considered an adjunctive therapy for surgery and radiotherapy. In cats with FISS without metastasis, the use of immunostimulant treatment with Oncept IL-2, intended as a complementary immunotherapy in association with surgery and brachytherapy, may also be considered to reduce the risk of relapse and increase the time to relapse. Additionally, this review focuses on recent advances in FISS treatment, including the use of novel compounds, such as doxorubicin conjugated to glutathione-stabilized gold nanoparticles, liposomal doxorubicin or tyrosine kinase inhibitors.
