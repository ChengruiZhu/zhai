The purpose of this study was to develop and validate cardiac computed tomography (CT) quantitative analysis software with a patient‐specific, 17‐segment myocardial model that uses electrocardiogram (ECG)‐gated cardiac CT images to differentiate between normal controls and severe aortic stenosis (AS) patients. ECG‐gated cardiac CT images from 35 normal controls and 144 AS patients were semiautomatically segmented to create a patient‐specific, 17‐segment myocardial model. Two experts then manually determined the anterior and posterior interventricular grooves to be boundaries between the 1st and 2nd segments and between the 3rd and 4th segments, respectively, to correct the model. Each segment was automatically identified as follows. The outer angle of two boundaries was divided to differentiate the 1st, 4th, 5th, and 6th segments in the basal plane, whereas the inner angle divided the 2nd and 3rd segments. The segments of the midplane were similarly divided. Segmental area distributions were quantitatively evaluated on the bull's‐eye map on the basis of the morphological boundaries by measuring the area of each segment. Segmental areas of severe AS patients and normal controls were significantly different (t‐test,
