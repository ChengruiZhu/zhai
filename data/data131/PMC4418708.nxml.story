Complexes formed between a structured domain on one protein and an unstructured peptide on another are ubiquitous. However, they are often quite difficult to detect experimentally. The development of computational approaches to predict domain-motif interactions is therefore an important goal. We report a method to predict domain-motif interactions using a Bayesian approach to integrate evidence from a variety of sources, including three-dimensional structural and non-structural information. The method was applied to the entire human proteome and showed significant improvement over existing methods. The method was incorporated into PrePPI, a computational pipeline for the prediction of protein-protein interactions that relies heavily on structural information. Approximately 80,000 new interactions were detected. The new PrePPI database provides easy access to about 400,000 human protein-protein interactions and should thus constitute a valuable resource in a variety of biological applications including the characterization of molecular interaction networks and, more generally, in the study of interactions mediated by proteins in families that may not be extensively studied experimentally.
