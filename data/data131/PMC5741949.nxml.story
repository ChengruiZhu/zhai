Curcumin could significantly augment the cytotoxicity of 5-Fu to the tumorous cells, and the pre-treatment with curcumin followed by 5-Fu (pre-Cur) proved to be the most effective one compared to other two combinations. The chemosensitizing role of curcumin might attribute to the autophagy turnover from being activated in 5-Fu mono-treatment to being inhibited in the pre-Cur treatment as indicated by the changes in expression of beclin-1, p62 and LC3II/LC3I and the intensity of Cyto-ID Green staining. The autophagic alterations appeared to be contributed by down-regulation of not only the phospho-Akt and phospho-mTOR expressions but the phospho-AMPK and phospho-ULK1 levels as well. The cellular activation of AMPK by addition of A-769662 to the pre-Cur combination resulted in reversed changes in expressions of the autophagy protein markers and apoptotic status compared to those of the pre-Cur combination treatment. The findings were validated in the xenograft mice, in which the tumor growth was significantly suppressed in the mice with 25-day combination treatment, and meanwhile expressions of the autophagy markers, P-AMPK and P-ULK1 were all reversely altered in line with those observed in HCT116 cells.
