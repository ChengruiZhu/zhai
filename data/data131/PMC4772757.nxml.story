This study investigates the intervention effect of individualized aerobic exercise on type 2 diabetes in teenagers. 60 cases of teenager were selected with type 2 diabetes in Zhoukou Hospital of Traditional Medicine from February 2013 to February 2014 as the research object. All enrolled patients’ maximal oxygen and blood glucose fluctuation was tested, followed by individualized aerobic exercise intervention. After 6 months of intervention, the changes in patients’ indexes were compared and the effects of individualized aerobic exercise intervention were evaluated. After the intervention, the patients’ plasma triglyceride and cholesterol content were found significantly lowered than before (P<0.05). However, there’s no significant difference between high and low-density lipoprotein (P>0.05). Moreover, the patients’ insulin and C-peptide levels were found significantly higher than those before intervention (P<0.05); before intervention, their blood glucose and glycated hemoglobin level were higher than normal, after intervention, they were weakened, but there’s no significant difference (P>0.05). The maximal oxygen uptake and different intensity of metabolic equivalents were higher than before, but there’s no significant difference (P>0.05). For teenagers with type 2 diabetes, the implementation of individualized aerobic exercise intervention could effectively improve the patients’ lipid metabolism and cardio-pulmonary function, and effectively promote the insulin and C-peptide secretion, which provides scientific basis for effective control of blood glucose.
