We here describe a patient with an idiopathic thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) secondary to an ADAMTS13 inhibitor that continued to be dependent on plasmapheresis until the patient was treated with rituximab. TTP manifestations subsided with rituximab treatment in spite of a persistently low ADAMTS13 activity and continued a detectable inhibitor activity until the patient developed an intolerance to rituximab due to an allergic reaction when cyclophosphamide was added; this resulted in a normalization of ADAMTS13 activity and the disappearance of the inhibitor. Later, the patient developed an intolerance to rituximab due to a severe allergic reaction. Soon after stopping rituximab, the ADAMTS13 activity level dipped below 5% in addition to the appearance of the ADAMTS13 inhibitor. The patient had a splenectomy after rituximab and cyclophosphamide treatment; the medication was stopped based on several case reports of a complete remission of TTP after splenectomy. We believe that the reason TTP went into remission in our patient was because of rituximab treatment, in spite of both persistently low ADAMTS13 activity and a detectable inhibitor activity due to reducing the release of von Willebrand factor large multimers from the endothelial cells. We found that ADAMTS13 activity normalized and the inhibitor activity became undetectable when cyclophosphamide was added to rituximab. We suggest adding cyclophosphamide to rituximab for the treatment of patients with persistent ADAMTS13 inhibitors in order to prolong the remission period and lower the rate of relapse.
