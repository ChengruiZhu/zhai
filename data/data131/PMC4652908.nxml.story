How do we navigate from one location to another and how do we represent space to accomplish this task? Researchers have collected data from the entorhinal cortex in rodents to answer these questions, finding grid cells that fire whenever a rodent traverses through an array of locations falling on the vertices of tightly packed equilateral triangles. Grid cells with large spacing (large side lengths of the triangles between firing fields) are distorted when the environment is manipulated, e.g. by pushing walls or inserting walls in a box. In contrast, grid cells of small spacing remain largely unaffected by such manipulations. We present a computational model to explain this behavior of grid cells. In our model information about the motion of features on the ground, which are unaffected by wall manipulations, drive grid cells with small spacing between firing fields, while static features like landmarks, which are affected by wall manipulations, drive grid cells with large spacing between firing fields. These differences could correspond to different positions within the visual field of the animal. This model puts forth a testable hypothesis about the type of features that drive grid cells of different spacing.
