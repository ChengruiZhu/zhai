The aim of the present study was to determine the effect of downregulating the expression of glucose-regulated protein 78 (Grp78) and Grp94 upon the rate of proliferation and apoptosis in the human gastric cancer SGC-7901 cell line. The SGC-7901 cells were divided into three groups as follows: i) An experimental group co-transfected with the small interfering RNA vectors, psiSTRIKE™/Grp78 and psiSTRIKE/Grp94; ii) a negative control group, in which only Lipofectamine 2000™ was used to transfect the cells; and iii) a blank control group, in which cells were left untouched and not transfected with any agent. The transcriptional expression of Grp78 and Grp94 was assayed by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction, and the protein expression of Grp78 and Grp94 was determined using an immunofluorescence assay at 24, 48 and 72 h post-transfection. The rates of cellular proliferation and apoptosis were assayed using MTT and flow cytometry analyses, respectively. The mRNA and protein expression of Grp78 and Grp94 in the gastric cancer cells was downregulated at 72 h post-transfection. In addition, the results of the MTT assay revealed that the proliferation rate of the gastric cancer cells in the co-transfected group was significantly inhibited at 72 h post-transfection compared with the control groups (P<0.05). The apoptosis ratio was significantly increased in the experimental group compared with the control groups (P<0.05). The co-transfection of the SGC-7901 cells with psiSTRIKE/Grp78 and psiSTRIKE/Grp94 markedly reduced the expression of Grp78 and Grp94, respectively. Furthermore, the reduction in the expression of Grp78 and Grp94 inhibited cellular proliferation and significantly downregulated the rate of apoptosis in the SGC-7901 cells
