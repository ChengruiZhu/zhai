These findings show that, among non-malnourished and moderately malnourished children living in Goronyo, Nigeria, provision of RUTF or MNP as part of routine primary medical care during convalescence following malaria, diarrhea, or a lower respiratory tract infection did not reduce the incidence of malnutrition. Because RUTF is popular with caregivers and children, the lack of blinding in this trial (participants knew whether they were being given RUTF, MNP or no supplement) may limit the accuracy of these findings. Moreover, these findings only apply to ill children and cannot be extrapolated to healthy children. Notably, a companion trial undertaken by MSF in Kaabong, Uganda found that short-term supplementation with RUTF reduced the incidence of malnutrition following illness. The researchers suggest that the lack of effect of nutritional supplementation in Goronyo may be because the duration and/or dose of supplementation was insufficient to mitigate the effects of high levels of illness and pre-existing malnutrition present in this setting. Thus, they suggest, an integrated approach that combines the prevention and treatment of diseases with the treatment of moderate malnutrition might be necessary to break the illnessâ€“malnutrition cycle among children living in Goronyo and similar settings.
