Charts of patients seen by the two senior authors from 2006 to 2011 were reviewed to identify patients treated for clavicle fractures (CPT 23500 and 23515). AP and 30 degree cephalad radiographs were selected, representing midshaft clavicle fractures treated both operatively and non-operatively. Thirty pairs of radiographs were included in the investigation. The radiographs were standardized for size to allow accurate measurements within a non-PACS program. A PDF file was created with all representative radiographs. Clinical scenarios were created for each set of radiographs, and the evaluators were asked to perform the following tasks: 1) measure the degree of shortening in millimeters; 2) determine the percent displacement; 3) determine whether the fracture was comminuted; and 4) state whether they would treat the fracture operatively or non-operatively. The radiographs and clinical scenario handout, along with instructions on how to use the measuring tool with Adobe Reader, were distributed to 16 shoulder/sports medicine fellowship-trained orthopaedic surgeons who completed the evaluations. The radiographs and scenarios were then reordered and redistributed approximately three months later.
