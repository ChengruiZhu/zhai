Much of the work inside the cell is carried out by proteins interacting with other proteins. Each edge in a protein-protein interaction network reflects these functional interactions and each node a separate protein, creating a complex structure that nevertheless follows well-established global and local patterns related to robust protein function. However, this network is not detailed enough to assess whether a particular protein can bind multiple interaction partners simultaneously through distinct interfaces, or whether the partners targeting a specific interface share similar structural or chemical properties. By breaking each protein node into its constituent interface nodes, we generate and assess such a detailed new network. To sample protein binding interactions broadly and accurately beyond those seen in crystal structures, our method combines computational interface assignment with data from biochemical studies. Using this approach we are able to assign interfaces to the majority of known interactions between proteins involved in the clathrin-mediated endocytosis pathway in yeast. Analysis of this interface-interaction network provides novel insights into the functional specificity of protein interactions, and highlights elements of cooperativity and competition among the proteins. By identifying diverse multi-protein complexes, interface-interaction networks also provide a map for targeted drug development.
