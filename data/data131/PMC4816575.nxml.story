Cloud cover affects many important ecological processes, including reproduction, growth, survival, and behavior. When quantified globally at high spatial resolution, cloud cover dynamics can provide key information for delineating a variety of habitat types and predicting species distributions. In this study, we develop a new near-global, fine-grain (â‰ˆ1 km) dataset of monthly cloud frequencies from 15 y of twice-daily satellite images. The new data reveal cloud cover dynamics at unprecedented spatial resolution. We show that the direct, observation-based nature of cloud-derived metrics can improve predictions of habitats, ecosystem, and species distributions with reduced spatial autocorrelation compared to commonly used interpolated climate data. These findings support the fundamental role of remote sensing as an effective lens through which to understand and globally monitor the fine-grain spatial variability of key biodiversity and ecosystem properties. Applications of these new data extend beyond ecology to validation of global climate models, economic applications in solar energy, tourism, and resource planning. With climate and land-use changes expected to perturb the geography of these conditions and ecological connections, standardized satellite-based observation of cloud cover may represent a key avenue for monitoring the health of biodiversity and ecosystems into the future.
