 to humans. Deregulation of Hh signal transduction contributes to a wide range of human disorders, including birth defects and cancer. The seven-transmembrane protein Smoothened (Smo) is an obligatory and conserved Hh signal transducer, but how Hh stimulates its activity remains unclear. Here we identify a plasma membrane associated kinase, Gilgamesh (Gish)/CK1γ, as a positive regulator of the Hh signaling activity. We find that Gish activates Hh signaling by phosphorylating a specific site in the Smo C-terminal intracellular tail. Phosphorylation of Smo by Gish is required for maximal activation of Smo and depends on membrane association of Gish and prior phosphorylation of Smo by protein kinase A (PKA). We also find that Hh stimulates the association of Smo with Gish after it travels to the plasma membrane, thus facilitating its phosphorylation by Gish. Finally, we provide evidence that CK1γ is found at the primary cilium in mammals and phosphorylates Smo to activate the Hh pathway. Our results uncover a conserved role of Gish/CK1γ in the regulation of Smo phosphorylation and provide new insight into the molecular underpinning of how Hh signal is transduced across the plasma membrane.
