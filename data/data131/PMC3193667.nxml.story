Hyperphosphatemia is an important modifiable risk factor for death and cardiovascular events in patients on hemodialysis (HD). As nicotinamide has been shown as an inhibitor of sodium–dependent phosphate co–transport in rat renal tubule and small intestine, we examined whether nicotinamide reduces hyperphosphatemia in patients undergoing HD. The study was conducted in 30 end-stage renal disease (ESRD) patients [20 (66.7%) males and 10 (33.3%) females; mean age 54 ± 14.9 years] undergoing twice/thrice weekly HD for more than 3 months. Patients on other phosphate binders were given a 2-week wash-out period. Nicotinamide 250 mg capsules were given twice daily for 25 patients with serum phosphorus greater than 5 mg/dL and thrice daily for 5 patients with serum phosphorus greater than 8 mg/dL immediately after food for 8 weeks. Serum phosphate and calcium levels were estimated every month prior to HD session, and complete blood count, blood sugar, renal profile, liver function tests were estimated at beginning and end of the study. Patients were regularly monitored for side effects. There were significant decreases in the serum phosphate (6.85 ± 1.35 mg/dL at the baseline to 5.74 ± 1.18 mg/dL at the 4
