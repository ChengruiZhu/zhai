Recently, several circulating miRNAs have been reported as promising, minimally invasive biomarkers for the diagnosis or prediction of the prognosis in various types of cancer. However, the utility of circulating miRNAs as predictive markers of the cancer response to neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy (nCRT) for locally advanced rectal cancer is still unclear. To identify circulating serum miRNAs useful for predicting a pathological good response to nCRT, total 18 serum miRNAs of interest were analyzed by real-time polymerase chain reaction in 94 rectal cancer patients treated with nCRT and surgery. Pathological complete response (pCR; Dworak TRG4) and near-pCR (TRG3) were obtained in 12 (13%) and 9 (9%) patients respectively, and we regarded them as nCRT-responders. Of the 18 serum miRNAs, only the serum level of miR-143 was identified significantly associated with a pathological response to nCRT in 94 patients; the serum miR-143 level was significantly lower in nCRT-responders than in non-responders. A multivariate analysis incorporating other clinicopathological factors showed that only the serum miR-143 level was an independent predictor of a good pathological response. The circulating serum miR-143 level may be a novel, non-invasive predictive marker of a response to nCRT in locally advanced rectal cancer patients.
