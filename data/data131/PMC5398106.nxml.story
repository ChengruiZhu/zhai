Chronic mucosal trauma resulting from sharp teeth, dentures, faulty restoration, or implants has frequently been associated with the development of oral cancer. The definitive evidence for the same is lacking. We undertook a search using the terms â€“ dental trauma, mucosal trauma, oral cancer, squamous cell carcinoma, risk factor, potentially malignant lesion, dental factor, mechanical irritation, dental irritation, and cancer in the following electronic databases: MEDLINE, PubMed, ScienceDirect, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, and Wiley InterScience. The search yielded 788 articles. Of these articles, only 22 articles described chronic mucosal trauma as risk factors for oral cancers and were considered in this review. The review shows that chronic mucosal irritation resulting from ill-fitting dentures may be considered a risk factor for the development of oral cancer, such cancers occur commonly over the lateral border of the tongue. However, no association has been proven between the duration of denture use and cancer formation. In patients without any addiction, such cancers occur more frequently in females. These cancers may present with an early nodal disease but their prognosis and outcomes have not been studied separately till now.
