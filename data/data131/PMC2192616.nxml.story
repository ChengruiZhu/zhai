It has been demonstrated that neutrophils from healthy donors or from patients with inflammatory disorders can bind immunoglobulin (Ig) E proteins through binding to Mac-2/epsilon bp. Functional responses to allergens were assessed by measuring the respiratory burst and intracellular Ca2+ levels, and binding of allergens to neutrophils was assessed by flow cytometry analysis and fluorescence microscopy. In this article, we demonstrate that neutrophils sensitized to specific allergens (from allergic patients), but not from healthy donors, are sensitive to allergens of the same type as those that produce clinical allergic symptoms. The activation of neutrophils was analyzed by the induction of a respiratory burst that was detected with luminol- dependent chemiluminescence. Intracellular Ca2+ levels increased parallel to those of the inducing allergens. In addition, the specific binding of allergens on the cell surface was revealed by flow cytometry and allergen-FITC-labeled staining analyses. The present data suggest a restricted recognition of allergen by sensitive neutrophils, probably associated with the specific binding of the allergen to its corresponding IgE molecule, which is bound to the Mac-2/epsilon bp structure. These findings demonstrate a functional role of allergen- associated neutrophils during the allergic state.
