In a multicellular organism, one genome is used to make numerous different cell-types. This must require the activity of all these genes to be configured into multiple distinct and stable active states, each corresponding to one of the different cell-types characteristic of a tissue. The stable active states of differentiated cell-types contrast with the different, and transient, states characteristic of multipotent stem cells. We know little of the key features of these states that regulate the switch of a stem cell to stable differentiation. Here we examine this issue in the melanocyte, a genetically well-characterised cell-type, using a combination of dynamic mathematical modelling and experimental manipulation. In humans, disruption of the melanocyte state results in congenital and degenerative pigmentary diseases, whereas their destabilisation is likely to be an important factor in initiating melanoma. Our work predicts, validates, and identifies several novel features to the gene regulatory network of the zebrafish melanocyte, including one stabilising the differentiated state. Our study demonstrates the utility of this systems biology approach to understanding the genetic basis for differentiated cell states.
