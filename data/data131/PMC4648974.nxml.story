In this study, a large-scale similarity search investigation has been carried out on 208 well-defined compound activity classes extracted from PubChem Bioassay Database. An analysis was performed to compare the search performance of three types of 2D similarity search approaches: 2D fingerprint based conventional similarity search approach (CSS), iterative similarity search approach with multiple active compounds as references (ISS), and fingerprint based iterative similarity search with classification (ISC), which can be regarded as the combination of iterative similarity search with active references and a reversed iterative similarity search with inactive references. Compared to the search results returned by CSS, ISS improves recall but not precision. Although ISC causes the false rejection of active hits, it improves the precision with statistical significance, and outperforms both ISS and CSS. In a second part of this study, we introduce the profile concept into the three types of searches. We find that the profile based non-iterative search can significantly improve the search performance by increasing the recall rate. We also find that profile based ISS (PBISS) and profile based ISC (PBISC) significantly decreases ISS search time without sacrificing search performance.
