Pressurized planar electrochromatography (PPEC) is a separating technique in which an electric field is applied to force the mobile phase movement through a porous media (electroosmotic effect). High separation efficiency, fast separations and changes in separation selectivity in comparison to liquid chromatography, especially thin layer chromatography (planar chromatography, TLC), are features of this technique. Constructional methodological challenges to PPEC are obstacles to its development and application in laboratory practice. In this article, an attempt to overcome the challenges related to device construction and sample application/injection is described. The introduced device enables both prewetting of the adsorbent layer and electrochromatogram development with a single PPEC device. It also enables simultaneous application/injection of six samples on a chromatographic plate in a stream of the mobile phase (on-line application/injection). In addition, the PPEC chamber was equipped with a thermostat. The device is characterized by an impressive throughput in comparison to the other planar technique, TLC/HPTLC. Although the developed device still needs improvement, it is, in our opinion, a considerable step toward possible automation of this planar separation technique.
