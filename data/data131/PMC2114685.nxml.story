The ability of purified extracellular matrix components to promote the initial migration of amphibian neural crest (NC) cells was quantitatively investigated in vitro. NC cells migrated avidly on fibronectin (FN), displaying progressively more extensive dispersion at increasing amounts of material incorporated in the substrate. In contrast, dispersion on laminin substrates was optimal at low protein concentrations but strongly reduced at high concentrations. NC cells were unable to migrate on substrates containing a high molecular mass chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan (ChSP). When proteolytic peptides, representing isolated functional domains of the FN molecule, were tested as potential migration substrates, the cell binding region of the molecule (105 kD) was found to be as active as the intact FN. A 31- kD heparin-binding fragment also stimulated NC cell migration, whereas NC cells dispersed to a markedly lower extent on the isolated collagen- binding domain (40 kD), or the latter domain linked to the NH2-terminal part of the FN molecule. Migration on the intact FN was partially inhibited by antibodies directed against the 105- and 31-kD fragments, respectively; dispersion was further decreased when the antibodies were used in combination. Addition of the ChSP to the culture medium dramatically perturbed NC cell migration on substrates of FN, as well as of 105- or 31-kD fragments. However, preincubation of isolated cells or substrates with ChSP followed by washing did not affect NC cell movement. The use of substrates consisting of different relative amounts of ChSP and the 105-kD peptide revealed that ChSP counteracted the motility-promoting activity of the 105-kD FN fragment in a concentration-dependent manner also when bound to the substrate. Our results indicate that NC cell migration on FN involves two separate domains of the molecule, and that ChSP can modulate the migratory behavior of NC cells moving along FN-rich pathways and may therefore influence directionally and subsequent localization of NC cells in the embryo.
