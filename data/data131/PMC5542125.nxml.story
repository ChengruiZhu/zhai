Following ACLR and completion of formal rehabilitation, 67 level I/II athletes (27 female) completed the following self-report measures at enrollment: Anterior Cruciate Ligament Return to Sport after Injury scale (ACL-RSI), International Knee Documentation Committee Subjective Knee Form (IKDC), and global rating scale (GRS). Subjects then underwent ten additional sessions, including injury prevention exercises, progressive strength training, agility training, and plyometric training, to transition the athlete to sport-specific activities. All self-report measures were repeated after training (post). Subjects subsequently completed the IKDC, a GRS, and indicated whether they had returned to the same level of sport one and two years after ACLR. Subjects were dichotomized into 2 groups based on their ACL-RSI scores. Subjects who displayed an increase in ACL-RSI score from enrollment to post that exceeded the MCID (â‰¥1.9) were defined as having a positive psychological response (responder) to training while those who did not were defined as non-responders. Independent t-tests and chi-square tests were used to measure group differences with all outcome measures at all time points (alpha = 0.05).
