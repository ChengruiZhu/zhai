Female mammals have two X chromosomes while males have one X and one Y chromosome. To equalize dosage of X chromosome genes in males and females, one X in female cells is inactivated, repressing the expression of most genes on the chromosome. Despite the chromosome-wide nature of X inactivation, at least 10%–15% of genes “escape” this inactivation in human females and are still expressed on the inactivated X. Whether a gene escapes or is subject to inactivation is thought to be determined epigenetically, and it is unknown to what extent, if at all, the underlying genomic DNA sequence of the chromosome plays a role. In this work, the authors show that the DNA sequence surrounding genes that escape inactivation is significantly different from the sequence surrounding genes that are subject to inactivation. In fact, a small number of DNA sequence features can be used to predict with high accuracy whether a gene will escape or be subject to this silencing. This establishes strong evidence that epigenetic regulation is, at least in part, dependent on genomic sequence and organization and provides a list of candidate sequence features whose role(s) in X inactivation can now be explored.
