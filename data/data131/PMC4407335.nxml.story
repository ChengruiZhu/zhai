Peripheral arterial disease is common in diabetic chronic kidney disease (CKD) and is characterized either by abnormally low or high ankle-brachial index (ABI). Whether low or high ABI carries similar prognostic value is unknown. The association of baseline ABI with all-cause mortality over 40 ± 21 months (mean ± SD) was ascertained in 167 proteinuric diabetics (age 57 ± 7 years; median urine protein-creatinine, 2.5 mg/mg). Association of change in ABI with all-cause mortality was determined in 75 subjects with normal ABI (0.9 – 1.3) at baseline. Among 167 participants, 41% had an abnormal ABI: < 0.9, 18%; and > 1.3 or non-compressible arteries, 23%. Only individuals with low ABI had a significantly higher risk for all-cause mortality (hazards ratio (95% confidence interval), HR: 2.23 (1.07, 4.65)). In subjects with normal ABI at baseline with follow-up measurement (n = 75), vascular disease worsened in 39% over 23 ± 6 months: 17% had either a decrease in ABI by ≥ 0.1 or a final ABI < 0.9, and 21% had a final ABI > 1.3 or non-compressible arteries. Only individuals who had a decrease in ABI over time had a significantly higher risk for death (adjusted HR, 7.41 (1.63, 33.65)). Peripheral arterial disease is not uncommon and progresses rapidly in individuals with diabetes and proteinuria. Low or declining ABI is a strong predictor of all-cause mortality. Routine measurement of ABI is a simple bed-side procedure that may permit easy risk-stratification in diabetic CKD patients.
