Giant cell tumors (GCTs) are generally benign, locally aggressive lesions with the potential to metastasize and a tendency of local recurrence. The present study aimed to investigate the advantages and long-term outcomes of application of ultrasonic scalpel in the treatment of GCT of long bones. This study retrospectively analyzed 32 cases of GCT of long bones, including 24 males and eight females. The age range was from 8 to 34 years old (mean age, 23.5 years old). The 32 cases were randomly divided into an observation group (n=10) and a control group (n=22). Patients in the observation group received curettage by ultrasonic scalpel combined with local methotrexate gelfoam adjuvant treatment, and then the cavity was filled with allograft and/or homograft bone. Patients in the control group eceived curettage by local methotrexate gelfoam adjuvant treatment and bone grafting. No local recurrence or pulmonary metastases were observed among patients in the observation group, however, six patients in the control group exhibited recurrence following surgery, although none of the patients demonstrated distant metastasis (P<0.05). Additionally, all 10 patients showed good bone knitting and rehabilitation without deformity and functional issues. The segmental bone graft was perfectly incorporated without obvious immune rejection, collapse and fracture. Curettage by ultrasonic scalpel with local methotrexate gelfoam adjuvant treatment and filling the site by allograft and/or homograft bone showed satisfactory results.
