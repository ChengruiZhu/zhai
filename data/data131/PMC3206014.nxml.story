The genome of each living organism contains thousands of genes, and the precise control of the timing and location of expression of these genes is key for normal development and homeostasis of each individual. Despite the oftentimes high genetic similarity between organisms, the source of phenotypic differences, for example between human and mouse, is thought to originate mainly from changes in how and when genes are expressed. This is partially determined by enhancers, that contribute to the control of gene expression. For decades, duplication of existing genomic enhancers, mobile elements, and changes in the sequence of existing enhancers were believed to be the major ways of increasing the number and modifying the activity of enhancers. In this study, we show that enhancers don't have to be derived from pre-existing ones but can also appear de novo in regions of the genome that were previously not regulating gene expression. We analyzed teleost fish genomes and found three regions for which a limited number of changes in the DNA sequence was sufficient to generate new enhancers. We predict that such a process is frequent in vertebrate genomes, making de novo generation of enhancers an important mechanism for creating variation in gene expression.
