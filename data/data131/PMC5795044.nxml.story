Over the past ten years there has been a marked increase in cases of severe fever and thrombocytopenia syndrome in East Asia. This tick-borne hemorrhagic fever presents along with clinical signs including high fever and leukopenia. In addition to humans, the virus has also been detected with shared genetic homology in farm animals including goats, cattle, horses, and pigs. Furthermore, several genotypes of severe fever and thrombocytopenia syndrome virus (SFTSV) are currently co-circulating between humans and animals. In China, where the virus was first detected in rural areas in 2009, the SFTSV mortality rate has been reported to be as 6% and higher than 30%, especially in immuno-compromised patients. Moreover, this virus has been isolated in neighbor countries including Japan and South Korea where the fatality rates in 2015 were more than 30% in both countries. In this review, we comprehensively summarize the virology, genotypes, pathogenesis, and epidemiology of SFTSV infection in humans and animals. Currently, a collaborative global approach against SFTSV infection is being undertaken; however, the need for continuous disease surveillance and production of an effective vaccine is imperative as this virus may lead to an epidemic of irreversible status in both humans and animals.
