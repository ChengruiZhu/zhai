A total of 8 healthy subjects (5 male, 3 female; age 22-28 years) without history of shoulder injury or treatments were recruited for this IRB-approved study. Subjects were instructed to perform a series of 30 pushups with hands shoulder width apart, spine in neutral, legs extended, and elbows bent parallel to the sagittal plane. Before and after exercise, axial MR imaging was taken of the subjectâ€™s dominant shoulder (3.0 T; Siemens TruFISP). To establish baseline cartilage thicknesses, subjects avoided strenuous upper-extremity activity for 24 hours prior to testing and rested 45 minutes immediately before pre-exercise imaging. Pre- and post-exercise MR images were imported into solid modeling software. From manual segmentation of glenohumeral cartilage and subchondral bone, 3D cartilage thickness maps were generated for the glenoid and humerus, before and after exercise (cartilage thickness = nearest distance between points on cartilage surface and underlying bone). After spatial registration of pre- and post-exercise models, cartilage strain (thickness change post-exercise, divided by pre-exercise thickness) was measured at 18 locations on the humeral head and 9 on the glenoid, averaging all strain measurements within 2 mm of the sampled location. Strain across the entire glenoid or humeral surface was calculated by averaging sampled measurements.
