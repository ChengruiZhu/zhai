H]thymidine into macronuclei in a periodic fashion during the heat-shock treatment. It was concluded that supernumerary S periods occurred while cell division was blocked by high temperature. The proportion of cells which initiated supernumerary S periods was found to be dependent on the duration of the heat-shock treatment and on the cell cycle stage when the first heat shock was applied. Cytofluorometric measurements of Feulgen-stained macronuclei during the heat-shock treatment indicated that the DNA complement of these cells was substantially increased and probably duplicated during the course of each S period. Estimates of DNA content also suggested that the rate of DNA synthesis progressively declined during long heat-shock treatments. These results indicate that the mechanism which brings about heat-induced division synchrony is not an interruption of the process of DNA replication. Further experiments were concerned with the regulation of DNA synthesis during the first synchronized division cycle. It was shown that participation in DNA synthesis at this time increased as more cells were able to conclude the terminal S period during the preceding heat-shock treatment. It is suggested that a discrete period of time is necessary after the completion of DNA synthesis before another round of DNA synthesis can be initiated.
