MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are well-known as key regulators of diverse biological pathways. A series of experimental evidences have shown that abnormal miRNA expression profiles are responsible for various pathophysiological conditions by modulating genes in disease associated pathways. In spite of the rapid increase in research data confirming such associations, scientists still do not have access to a consolidated database offering these miRNA-pathway association details for critical diseases. We have developed miRwayDB, a database providing comprehensive information of experimentally validated miRNA-pathway associations in various pathophysiological conditions utilizing data collected from published literature. To the best of our knowledge, it is the first database that provides information about experimentally validated miRNA mediated pathway dysregulation as seen specifically in critical human diseases and hence indicative of a cause-and-effect relationship in most cases. The current version of miRwayDB collects an exhaustive list of miRNA-pathway association entries for 76 critical disease conditions by reviewing 663 published articles. Each database entry contains complete information on the name of the pathophysiological condition, associated miRNA(s), experimental sample type(s), regulation pattern (up/down) of miRNA, pathway association(s), targeted member of dysregulated pathway(s) and a brief description. In addition, miRwayDB provides miRNA, gene and pathway score to evaluate the role of a miRNA regulated pathways in various pathophysiological conditions. The database can also be used for other biomedical approaches such as validation of computational analysis, integrated analysis and prediction of computational model. It also offers a submission page to submit novel data from recently published studies. We believe that miRwayDB will be a useful tool for miRNA research community.
