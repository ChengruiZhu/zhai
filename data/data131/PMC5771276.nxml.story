Subclinical hypothyroidism represents a state with increased values of thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) and normal values of thyroxine (T4) and triiodothyronine (T3). The disorder is asymptomatic, and the diagnosis is made based on the results of laboratory findings when the level of TSH reaches values above 4.0 mU/l. It is still subject to debate whether patients with subclinical hypothyroidism are at increased risk of cardiovascular disease, neuropsychiatric and neuromuscular disorders. Studies have shown that the appearance of general symptoms and complications are more common in patients whose values of TSH are above 10 mU/l. Therefore, the initiation of therapy with levothyroxine, which is the foundation of substitution therapy, is advised in patients whose TSH is >10 mU/l. As for patients whose values of TSH are from 4.0 to 10.0 mU/l and who make up 90% of the patients with subclinical hypothyroidism, further research is needed to determine the effects of the disorder and levothyroxine therapy on the health. Until then, the introduction of the substitution therapy in patients with TSH which is <10 mU/l should be considered in the case of the presence of general symptoms, anti-thyroid antibodies, increased lipids and other risk factors, goitre, pregnancy, ovarian dysfunction and infertility.
