Anti-inflammatory therapeutic options for the topical treatment of skin diseases with inflammatory or allergic contribution are mostly limited to topical glucocorticoids and calcineurin inhibitors. Both compound classes induce adverse effects. Elevation of intracellular cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) by inhibition of phosphodiesterase 4 was shown to induce potent anti-inflammatory effects, but the safety profile of currently available compounds is not sufficient. A different approach to increase intracellular cAMP is the substitution of chemically stabilized cAMP analogues. Bucladesine is a stabilized cAMP analogue with an excellent safety profile which had been marketed as topical treatment of impaired wound healing. In the current study, a novel water free emulsion containing bucladesine was evaluated for anti-inflammatory effects. In the arachidonic acid induced ear oedema model in mice, single or multiple administration of an emulsion containing 1.5% was capable of significantly reducing the inflammatory oedema. The data indicate that bucladesine represents an interesting treatment option for skin diseases where an anti-inflammatory activity is indicated. Due to the established clinical safety, this agent may bridge the gap between potent agents such as glucocorticoids or calcineurin inhibitors and emollients without active compounds.
