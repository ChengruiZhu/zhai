Localization of antisera to neurofilament antigens derived from rat peripheral nerve was carried out in tissues of rat and human peripheral and central nervous systems by indirect immunofluorescence. Unfixed and chloroform-methanol-fixed frozen sections of tissues were incubated in purified IgG of the experimental rabbit antisera and subsequently exposed to goat anti-rabbit IgG conjugated with fluorescein isothiocyanate. Control studies were conducted on identical tissue preparations incubated in the same concentrations of nonspecific rabbit IgG or in experimental rabbit IgG absorbed with extracts of rat peripheral nerve containing neurofilament antigen. Extensive immunofluorescence was observed in rat and human peripheral and central nervous systems. The distribution and configuration of immunofluorescence corresponded to neurofilament-rich structural components of these tissues. Prominent immunofluorescence was also noted in neuronal cell bodies of spinal sensory ganglia, especially in perikarya of the large neuronal type. Immunofluorescence of the central nervous system was located predominantly in myelinated axons of the white matter in cerebrum, cerebellum, brain stem, and spinal cord. Less intense immunofluorescence was also seen in neuronal perikarya and in short thin linear processes of grey matter.
