 A marked reactivation of tobacco mosaic virus protein that has been partially or completely inactivated by formaldehyde was obtained by dialysis at pH 3. The activity of partially inactivated virus proteins was generally increased about 10-fold by the reactivation process. It was also found possible to reactivate completely inactive preparations to an appreciable extent. It was shown that the inactivation and the subsequent reactivation cannot be explained by the toxicity of the formaldehyde or of the formolized protein or by aggregation. Inactivation was accompanied by a decrease in amino groups as indicated by Van Slyke gasometric determinations and by colorimetric estimations using ninhydrin. Inactivation also causes a decrease in the number of groups that react with Folin's reagent at pH 7.7. The latter are probably the indole nuclei of tryptophane, for it was demonstrated that tryptophane, glycyltryptophane, and indole propionic acid react with formaldehyde in a similar manner, while tyrosine and glycyltyrosine do not. Evidence that reactivation is accompanied by an increase in amino nitrogen and in groups that react with Folin's reagent was obtained by colorimetric estimation. The demonstration that the addition of formaldehyde to the virus protein results in a simultaneous decrease of activity, of amino groups, and of groups that react with Folin's phenol reagent, and that under conditions favorable for the removal of formaldehyde the virus activity is regained and the number of such groups increases, indicates that certain of these groups play at least a partial role in the structure necessary for virus activity. These changes can best be interpreted on the basis of known chemical reactions and are considered as evidence that virus activity is a specific property of the protein.
