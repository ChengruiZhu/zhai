In the present study, we investigated the effect of a combination of atorvastatin and celecoxib on the formation of interleukin (IL)-6, a cytokine that is increased during the progression of LNCaP tumors from androgen dependence to androgen independence. Culturing LNCaP cells in androgen-depleted (AD) medium increased the levels of IL-6 and survivin, and treatment of the cells in AD medium with a combination of atorvastatin and celecoxib strongly inhibited the increase in IL-6 and survivin which is one of the downstream targets of the IL-6 signaling pathway. Addition of recombinant IL-6 partially abrogated the combined effect of atorvastatin and celecoxib on apoptosis in LNCaP cells cultured in AD medium. In SCID mice, we found that the levels of IL-6 and survivin expression were increased when LNCaP tumors became androgen-independent. Treatment of the mice with atorvastatin or celecoxib alone caused decrease in the levels of IL-6 and survivin as LNCaP tumors became androgen-independent, but treatment of the mice with a combination of celecoxib and atorvastatin resulted in a much stronger inhibition in the increase in IL-6 and survivin expression. Our results indicate that decreases in IL-6 and survivin levels by atorvastatin and celecoxib administration are associated with increased apoptosis in LNCaP cells treated with this drug combination.
