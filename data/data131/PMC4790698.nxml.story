Vascular endothelial growth factor receptor-2 (VEGFR-2), which is a key determinant of the angiogenecic response, is decreased in diabetic mice under oxidative stress. β-transduction repeat-containing protein (β-TrCP) has been reported to participate in VEGFR-2 degradation in thyroid cancer cells. Additionally, glycogen synthase kinase-3β (GSK-3β) acts as a mediator in the β-TrCP-induced degradation of several proteins. However, the role played by β-TrCP and GSK-3β in the degradation of VEGFR-2 in endothelial cells where hyperglycemia had been induced was not fully understood. In the present study, we aimed to analyze the mechanisms of VEGFR-2 degradation by studying excess reactive oxygen species (ROS) induced by hyperglycemia or glucose oxidase (GO). Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) were treated with different concentrations of glucose (6.6, 19.8 and 33 mM), mannitol (33 mM) and GO (1 U/ml). Angiogenic function, ROS levels, the co-location of VEGFR-2 and β-TrCP were evaluated. Cells were collected for RT-qPCR and western blot analysis. We noted that angiogenesis was impaired upon increasing the glucose concentration. When HUVECs were in a hyperglycemic state, ROS production increased, comparable to exposure to GO; GO catalyzes oxidation of glucose into H
