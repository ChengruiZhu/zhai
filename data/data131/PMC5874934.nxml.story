Using a MatriXX 2D ionization chamber array, we evaluated the detection sensitivity of systematically introduced MLC leaf positioning shifts to test whether the conventional IMRT QA method can be used for quality assurance of an MLC tracking algorithm. Because of finite special resolution, we first tested whether the detection sensitivity was dependent of the locations of leaf shifts and positions of ionization chambers. We then introduced the same systematic leaf shifts in two clinical intensity modulated radiotherapy plans (prostate and head and neck cancer). Our results reported differences between the measured planar doses with and without MLC shifts (errors). Independent of the locations of the leaf position shifts and positions of the detectors, for the simple rectangular fields, the MatriXX was able to detect ±2 mm MLC leaf positioning shifts with Gamma index of 3%/3 mm and ±1 mm MLC leaf position shifts with Gamma index of 2%/2 mm. For the clinical plans, measuring the fields individually, leaf positioning shifts of ±2 mm were detected using Gamma index of 3%/3 mm and a passing rate of 95%. When the fields were measured compositely, the Gamma index exhibited less sensitivity for the detection of leaf positioning shifts than when the fields were measured individually. In conclusion, if more than 2 mm MLC leaf shifts were required, the commercial detector array (MatriXX) is able to detect such MLC positioning shifts, otherwise a more sensitive quality assurance method should be used.
