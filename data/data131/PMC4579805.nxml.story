In order to review the surgical experience of a single institute with regard to the treatment of primary cardiac tumors, data was collected on patients with a histopathological diagnosis of a primary cardiac tumor (with the exception of myxoma) in a retrospective analysis of those treated between 2004 and 2013. In total, 11 patients were identified, with a mean age at diagnosis of 23 months and a mean weight of 13 kg. The most frequent cause of referral was a cardiac murmur and the most frequent cardiac tumor was rhabdomyoma (5 cases), followed by fibroma (3 cases), angiofibroma (2 cases) and fibrosarcoma (1 case). Surgical removal of the tumor was performed in all patients due to the respective clinical symptoms. A subtotal resection was performed in a single patient (with angiofibroma invading the aortic root, superior vena cava and sinus node) due to financial constraints. This patient succumbed to tumor invasion 2 years later. Another of the patients (pericardial fibrosarcoma) succumbed 1 year after the total resection, as they were unable to undergo a repeat surgery for the relapsed tumor due to financial inadequacy. The remaining 9 patients have survived in good condition during the 1â€“6 year follow-up. Surgery is the preferred treatment for patients with symptomatic primary cardiac tumors, and has good early- and long-term outcomes. However, due to the current health care system inadequacies in China, certain parents cannot afford the medical expenses, thus, more comprehensive social security and medical insurance may require consideration.
