Many olfactory systems are capable of accurately sensing a minimum of thousands of different odorants using as few as hundreds of different receptors. This compression raises the possibility that the mathematical properties of compressed sensing might be relevant to olfaction, similar to how these properties were found relevant to other sensory systems. In olfaction, previous applications of compressed sensing algorithms relied on the dynamics of neural circuits to reconstruct high dimensional signals. Such approaches are relatively temporally inefficient and sensitive to noise. To overcome these problems, we propose a purely feedforward compressed sensing model of the olfactory system where high dimensional signals can be recovered with a single feedforward layer of neural processing. The reconstructions are shown to be robust to noise, account for a number of experimental observations, and because of the feedforward structure are temporally efficient. Using the model, we make predictions that can be tested in future experiments with respect to optimal connectivity within the olfactory system. Our results indicate that feedforward neural architectures can provide an efficient way to implement compressed sensing in neural systems.
