Vegetables and fruits that are otherwise considered beneficial to our health can have serious consequences in medical care. Interference of plant-based foods with drug performance and pharmacological activity may potentially contribute to an increased risk of side effects or treatment failure. A well-known example of a drug-food interaction, the inhibitory effect of grapefruit juice on cytochrome P450, results in increased bioavailability of drugs such as felodipine, cyclosporine and saquinavir, which could lead to drug toxicity and poisoning. Although the importance of drug-food interactions has long been known, a systematic approach to identify, predict and prevent potential interactions between food and drugs has not yet been established. This work sets the ground for the understanding of the key molecular mechanisms of drug-food interactions with the scope to optimize therapeutic strategies and improve patient care. We tackle this problem using NutriChem, a database we have recently developed with information from the scientific literature and online databases related to natural compound origin and bioactivity. This systems chemical biology approach provides the basis for the identification and study of the substances in plant-based foods that affect the human proteins that are relevant for the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of current medicine.
