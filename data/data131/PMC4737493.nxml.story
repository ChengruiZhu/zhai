Glutamine synthetase (GS) catalyzes the ATP-dependent ligation of ammonia and glutamate to glutamine, which makes the enzyme essential for human nitrogen metabolism. Three mutations in human GS, R324C, R324S, and R341C, had been identified previously that lead to a glutamine deficiency, resulting in neonatal death in the case of R324C and R341C. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying this impairment of GS activity have remained elusive. Our results from computational biophysics approaches suggest that all three mutants influence the first step of GS’ catalytic cycle, namely ATP or glutamate binding. The analyses reveal a complex set of effects including the loss of direct interactions to substrates, the involvement of water-mediated interactions that alleviate part of the mutation effect, and long-range effects between the catalytic site and structural parts distant from it. As to the latter, experimental validation is in line with our prediction of a significant destabilization of helix H8 in the R341C mutant, which should negatively affect glutamate binding. Finally, our findings could stimulate the development of ATP-binding enhancing molecules for the R324S mutant, which has been suggested to have residual activity, that way extrinsically “repairing” the mutant.
