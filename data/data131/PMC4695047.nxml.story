Cancer cells adapt to hypoxia by the stabilization of hypoxia inducible factor (HIF)-α isoforms that increase the transcription of several genes. Among the genes regulated by HIF are enzymes that play a role in invasion, metastasis and metabolism. We engineered triple (estrogen receptor/progesterone receptor/HER2/neu) negative, invasive MDA-MB-231 and SUM149 human breast cancer cells to silence the expression of HIF-1α, HIF-2α or both isoforms of HIF-α. We determined the metabolic consequences of HIF silencing and the ability of HIF-α silenced cells to invade and degrade the extracellular matrix (ECM) under carefully controlled normoxic and hypoxic conditions. We found that silencing HIF-1α alone was not sufficient to attenuate invasiveness in both MDA-MB-231 and SUM149 cell lines. Significantly reduced metastatic burden was observed in single (HIF-1α or HIF-2α) and double α-isoform silenced cells, with the reduction most evident when both HIF-1α and HIF-2α were silenced in MDA-MB-231 cells. HIF-2α played a major role in altering cell metabolism. Lipids and lipid droplets were significantly reduced in HIF-2α and double silenced MDA-MB-231 and SUM149 cells, implicating HIF in their regulation. In addition, lactate production and glucose consumption were reduced. These results suggest that
