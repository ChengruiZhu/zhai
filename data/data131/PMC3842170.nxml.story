Most patients with advanced breast cancer develop osteolytic bone metastases, which have numerous complications. Because current therapies are not curative, new treatments are needed. Conditionally replicating adenoviruses (CRAds) are anticancer agents designed to infect and lyse tumor cells. However, in spite of their promise as selective cancer therapeutics, replicating adenoviruses have shown limited efficacy in the clinical setting. We hypothesized that a CRAd armed with osteoprotegerin (OPG) would eradicate bone metastases of breast cancer both directly, by oncolysis, and indirectly, by inhibiting osteoclastic bone resorption and thus reducing the tumor burden. We constructed an armed CRAd (Ad5-Δ24-sOPG-Fc-RGD) by replacing viral E3B genes with a fusion of the ligand-binding domains of OPG and the Fc portion of human IgG1. Conditional replication was conferred by a 24-base pair deletion within E1A (Δ24), which prevents the binding of E1A to the retinoblastoma tumor suppressor/cell cycle regulator protein and limits replication in normal cells. Enhanced infection of cells expressing low levels of the primary Ad5 receptor was conferred by incorporating an RGD peptide sequence into the fiber knob to mediate binding to α
