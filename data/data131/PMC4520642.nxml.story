We carried out a multicenter dose-escalation phase I study of oral OPB-51602, a signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 phosphorylation inhibitor, in patients with relapsed or refractory hematological malignancies to evaluate the safety, maximum tolerated dose (MTD), pharmacokinetics, and preliminary antitumor activity. Twenty patients were treated with OPB-51602 at doses of 1, 2, 3, 4, and 6 mg in the “3 + 3” dose escalation design. The most common treatment-related adverse events included nausea (55%), peripheral sensory neuropathy (45%), and diarrhea (40%). The most frequently observed grade 3 or 4 drug-related adverse events were neutropenia (20%), leukopenia (15%), lymphopenia (10%), and thrombocytopenia (10%). The MTD was 6 mg, with dose-limiting toxicities of grade 3 lactic acidosis and increased blood lactic acid levels observed in one of three patients and grade 1–2 peripheral neuropathy in three of three patients. The recommended dose was determined to be 4 mg. OPB-51602 was rapidly absorbed, and exposure tended to increase in a dose-dependent manner. Accumulation of OPB-51602 was seen with 4 weeks of multiple treatments. No clear therapeutic response was observed. Durable stable disease was observed in two patients with acute myeloid leukemia and one with myeloma. In conclusion, the MTD of OPB-51602 was 6 mg. OPB-51602 was safe and well tolerated in a dose range of 1–4 mg. However, long-term administration at higher doses was difficult with the daily dosing schedule, and no response was seen. Therefore, further clinical development of OPB-51602 for hematological malignancies with a daily dosing schedule was terminated.
