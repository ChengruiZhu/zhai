Several proteins that circulate in blood have been linked to cardiovascular disease through the use of classic epidemiology and correlation studies. If individuals with higher risk of disease have higher levels of a protein, the protein may be associated with disease. However, this does not necessarily mean that the protein causes disease; it may merely be an innocent bystander or a consequence of the disease process. To establish whether a protein causes disease, a genetic approach, insensitive to reverse causation, can be used. Instead of correlating the levels of the protein itself, gene variants that regulate the protein levels are used in the analysis. This approach requires prior knowledge of which genetic variants are linked to individual proteins. Therefore we completed a map of how common genetic variants affect the blood concentration levels of 83 proteins that have been implicated in cardiovascular disease. By using this map of cause-to-effect findings, we gained insights into the regulation of a majority of the proteins under study and how they relate to risk of coronary artery disease. This study provides a map of genetic regulation of important cardiovascular plasma proteins, insights into their upstream regulatory environment, as well as novel leads for cardiovascular drug development.
