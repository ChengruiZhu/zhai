Gene expression in all living organisms is regulated by a complex set of events at both transcriptional and posttranscriptional levels. RNA-binding proteins play a key role in posttranscriptional events including splicing, stability, transport, and translation. Nowadays, there is increasing evidence that many other cellular processes may be mediated by RNA. Identifying new proteins involved in interaction with RNA is thus essential to unraveling the cellular processes in which these interactions are involved. In the current study we present a successful computational approach for classifying RNA-binding proteins and distinguishing them from other proteins based on structural and electrostatic properties. We test the method on a unique protein domain, the RNA recognition motif (RRM), which mediates both RNA and protein interactions. We show that we can discriminate RNA-binding RRMs from protein-binding RRMs. Further, we demonstrate that we can classify known RNA-binding proteins based on their RNA target (mRNA, rRNA, or tRNA). Our method does not rely on any kind of evolutionary information and thus can be applied to identify RNA-binding proteins with novel modes of RNA recognition.
