Complex regulatory networks control the transcription state of a genome that defines the components of a biochemical network. These transcriptional regulatory networks have been mathematically described. The purpose of many such mathematical models is to allow for the prediction of gene expression under a variety of environmental conditions. However, to date, quantitative models have been limited in scope due to a paucity of relevant data, and models of larger networks have been limited in their quantitative predictive power. Herein, Gianchandani and colleagues present a formalism that represents regulatory rules in a matrix form which attempts to address these issues. This matrix formalism allows for the systemic characterization of the properties of a transcriptional regulatory system and facilitates the computation of the transcriptional state of the corresponding genome under any given set of environmental conditions. Additionally, it provides a means to incorporate mechanistic detail of a transcriptional regulatory system as it becomes available. The authors illustrate how this matrix representation allows for a sampling of all possible expression states of a given network and provides a way to study key features. They also present how it may assist in experimental design to interrogate genome-scale cellular networks.
