The phosphorylation of proteins by kinases is one of the most common post-translational modifications that regulates protein function in a variety of processes. Protein kinases are usually counteracted by specific phosphatases that remove the phosphate groups from proteins. We have undertaken a systematic biochemical (“proteomics”) approach to identify the substrates of the Density-Enhanced Phosphatase DEP-1. The DEP-1 phosphatase has previously been identified as a growth inhibitor and tumor suppressor that de-phosphorylates different growth factor receptors to inhibit intracellular signal transduction and cell proliferation. Here, we have identified a ß-integrin subunit as a specific DEP-1 substrate. Integrins consist of one α and one β subunits that function as cell adhesion molecules mediating the attachment of cells to the extracellular matrix. The de-phosphorylation of integrins causes their activation and stabilizes the adhesion sites. By engineering a ß-integrin mutation that cannot be phosphorylated and hence does not depend on the DEP-1 phosphatase, we show that integrin activation not only permits extracellular matrix adhesion but also attenuates epidermal growth factor signaling. Our findings point at a dual role of the DEP-1 phosphatase in regulating EGFR signaling by simultaneously de-phosphorylating integrins and growth factor receptors.
