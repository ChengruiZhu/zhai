To report a single-institution experience of gamma evaluations with 2%/1 mm for stereotactic ablative radiotherapy (SABR) delivered with volumetric modulated arc therapy (VMAT) technique, from January 2014 to January 2016. A total of 168 SABR VMAT plans were analyzed with a gamma criterion of 2%/1 mm, a threshold value of 10%, and a tolerance level of 90%. Of the 168 cases, four cases failed with 2%/1 mm. The average passing rate was 97.0% Â± 2.5%. Three of the four failed cases showed passing rates higher than 90%, which was achieved by shifting the measuring device by 1 mm in the left-to-right or anterior-to-posterior directions. One failed case showed a passing rate higher than 90%, which was achieved by changing the threshold value from 10% to 5%, leading to an increase in the number of tested points from 26 to 51. Concerns regarding the high susceptibility of the gamma criterion of 2%/1 mm to setup errors of the measuring device are unnecessary based on our two-year experience, since only four cases failed with the 2%/1 mm from a total of 168 clinical cases. Therefore, the gamma criterion of 2%/1 mm could be successfully applied in the clinic with its high sensitivity to detect errors in VMAT plans.
