The chronic ear survey (CES) is a sensitive and disease specific quality of life (QoL) measurement tool in patients with chronic suppurative otitis media (CSOM). It is a 13-item survey that evaluates the frequency, duration and severity of problems associated with this disease. It is composed of three subscales that describe activity restrictions, symptoms and medical resource utilisation. Based on patient's answers, it is possible to obtain a score resulting in a scale ranging from 0 to 100; the highest indicates the best health, while the lowest denotes poor health. The questionnaire was originally created in English. The aim of this study is to validate the CES questionnaire in Italian (CES-I). Translation was made following international guidelines. The application follows the stages of translation from English to Italian and linguistic adaptation, and grammatical and idiomatic equivalence review. The CES-I and the Short Form Health Survey 36 (SF-36) questionnaires were administered to 54 patients with CSOM. A cross-sectional design was used to examine the internal consistency (Cronbach's alpha) and concurrent validity (Pearson's product moment correlation). To confirm the external validity of CES-I, Pearson correlation coefficient, considering the total score and single subscales of CES and the 8 scales of the SF-36, was calculated. Cronbach's alpha coefficient for internal consistency was 0.737. The intraclass correlation coefficient, measured through mixed effects, was 0.737 (95% CI: 0.600–0.835, p < 0.001) for average measures and 0.412 (95%CI: 0.273–0.559, p < 0.001) for individual measures. According to our results, CES-I is a reliable tool for evaluation of QoL in patients with CSOM among the Italian-speaking population.
