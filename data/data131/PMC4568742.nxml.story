In its decades-long history, the Division of Blood Disorders (DBD) at CDC has evolved from a patient-focused, services-supporting entity at inception, to one of the world leaders in the practice of public health to improve the lives of people at risk for or affected by nonmalignant blood disorders. The DBD’s earliest public health activities consisted of working with care providers in a network of hemophilia treatment centers to provide AIDS risk reduction services to people with hemophilia. Because this infectious disease threat has been reduced over time as a result of the development of safer treatment products, the DBD—under the auspices of congressional appropriations guidance—has expanded its core activities to encompass blood disorders other than hemophilia, including hemoglobinopathies such as thalassemia and sickle cell disease, and Diamond Blackfan anemia. Simultaneously, in transitioning to a greater public health role, the DBD has expanded its network of partners to new consumer and professional organizations, as well as state and other federal health agencies. The DBD has also developed and maintains many surveillance and registry activities beyond the Universal Data Collection system aimed at providing a better understanding of the health status, health needs, and health-related quality of life of people with nonmalignant blood disorders. The DBD has integrated applicable components of the Essential Services of Public Health successfully to promote and advance the agenda of blood disorders in public health.
