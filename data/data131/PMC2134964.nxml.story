Unlike other amino acids that constitute proteins, Proline is missing a vital hydrogen atom and also bestows local structural rigidity to the three-dimensional (3D) structure of proteins. In some locations, proline can be introduced with little or no detrimental effect to protein function, while at others it is destabilizing and can result in significant degradation or aggregation of the protein. To determine the features of protein 3D structure that tolerate the introduction of prolines, each of the 101 amino acid residues of the protein CcdB were replaced with Proline, and the functional consequence of the mutations were observed. On correlating these data to features of protein 3D structure, a decision tree was generated to predict the functional consequences of proline mutations in proteins of known (or accurately modeled) 3D structure. The performance of the tree was assessed on three different datasets that contained a total of 289 proline mutants in 37 different proteins. The average accuracy of prediction was 75%. The decision tree will be useful in predicting if known but uncharacterized proline mutations in disease-related proteins are likely to have adverse effects. It will also be useful in engineering and designing new proteins and peptides.
