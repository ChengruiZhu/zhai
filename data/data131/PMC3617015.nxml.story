Daily motor tasks typically involve more degrees-of-freedom than strictly required. For instance, pressing a button in the elevator only requires positioning the fingertip at a three-dimensional location in space. However, to move the arm we need to control many more degrees-of-freedom (at least seven, only considering the shoulder, elbow and wrist) than required by the task, each with its own variability due to physiological factors such as tremor. Variability at proximal joints (e.g. shoulder or elbow) is expected to be amplified and projected at the distal end (fingertip). Remarkably, inter-joint coordination reduces the final variability at the fingertip position. Recent theories, such as the uncontrolled manifold (UCM), distinguished between inter-joint variability that would not affect the finger position and variability that would affect the final task. A major issue is that traditional UCM methods rely on the coordinate system chosen to analyse the arm motion. Therefore, we introduce a coordinate independent UCM method for tasks performed with handheld tools, e.g. surgery. This paper describes a new method and demonstrates that it enables an accurate analysis of static pointing. The results clearly show that the subjects can channel variability in dimensions that do not affect the task outcome.
