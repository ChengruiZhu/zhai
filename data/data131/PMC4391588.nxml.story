Recent studies have revealed that cancer cells are exacerbated by chronic inflammation. The present study examined the immunohistochemical expression for interleukin-6 (IL-6), a pleiotropic inflammatory cytokine, in oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) to elucidate the association of IL-6 expression with tumor progression, chemoresistance and prognosis. Seventy-eight patients with primary OSCC were analyzed by immunohistochemical staining for IL-6. These labeling indexes (LIs) were calculated and evaluated in association with the clinicopathologic characteristics and prognosis in the OSCC patients. The patients were divided into three groups as follows: negative group = LI <5%; low IL-6 group = 5% ≤ LI <30%; high IL-6 group = LI ≥30%. The patient numbers of the negative, low and high expression groups were 24, 22 and 32, respectively. In the high IL-6 expression group, IL-6 receptor (IL-6R), phospho-signal tranducer and activator of transcription 3 (p-STAT3) were also detected in almost all the cancer cells. The prevalence of the cervical lymph node or the distant metastasis in the high expression group was significantly higher than those in the negative and low expression groups. Furthermore, the high expression group had a significantly poorer tumor response to the preoperative chemoradiotherapy and a more unfavourable prognosis than the negative and the low expression groups. Interestingly, IL-6, IL-6R and p-STAT3 were expressed in the residual cancer cells of all the patients in the high expression group with poor response to chemoradiotherapy. These results suggested that IL-6 signaling possibly is involved in the progression and treatment-resistance of OSCC and IL-6 expression in cancer cells could be a useful predictive factor of poor response to chemoradiotherapy and unfavorable prognosis.
