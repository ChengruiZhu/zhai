Recent evidence suggests that neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL) is required for the development and/or progression of benign and malignant disease, and is overexpressed in several types of tumor. Matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9), by degrading components of the extracellular matrix and thus promoting the release of growth factors, is important in tumor growth and tumorigenicity. NGAL protects MMP-9 from proteolytic degradation and enhances its enzymatic activities by binding and forming the MMP-9/NGAL complex. Therefore, NGAL, MMP-9 and their complex MMP-9/NGAL have been proposed as soluble biomarkers for numerous malignancies. In the present study, we measured the concentration of these molecules in sera and urine of patients with kidney disease using ELISA. Of these patients, 16 had clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) and 4 had oncocytoma. Sera and urine samples of 53 healthy patients were used as controls. In sera, MMP-9 was enhanced in ccRCC patients compared with oncocytoma patients. In urine, the most abundant molecule was NGAL and its mean value was higher in cancer patients. However, there was a broad overlap of the data and we did not identify any correlation with disease type, stage or grade. Therefore, these molecules may not be useful as biomarkers for predicting kidney carcinoma.
