Most individual protein domains fold in an all or nothing fashion. This cooperative folding is important because it reduces the existence of partially folded proteins which can stick to each other and create disease causing aggregates. However, numerous proteins have multiple domains, independent units of folding, stability and/or function. Several such proteins also fold cooperatively. It is thought that strong interactions between individual domains allow the folding to propagate from a nucleating domain to neighbouring ones and this enables cooperative folding in multi-domain proteins. Here, we computationally study the folding of the three-domain protein AKE and find instead that the topology of the protein, wherein the two less stable domains are inserted into the more stable one, promotes folding cooperativity. When the more stable domain is folded, the ends of the inserted domains are constrained and this allows them to fold easily. In such a protein topology, strong inter-domain interactions are not needed to promote folding cooperativity. Interface amino acids which would have been involved in ensuring that the domains fit together correctly can now be tuned for binding or catalysis or conformational transitions. Thus, inserted domains may be present in multi-domain proteins to promote both function and folding.
