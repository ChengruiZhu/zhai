Interacting sperm and egg proteins must co-evolve to maintain compatibility at fertilization, so their divergence among species should be correlatedâ€”lineages with rapidly evolving sperm proteins should have rapidly evolving egg proteins. We use this expectation to target biochemical studies of fertilization in a model system (abalone). We study a discrete functional domain (ZP-N) found in a pair of duplicated egg coat proteins, and we find the ZP-N motif from both proteins bind sperm lysin (a protein important for sperm passage of the egg coat) in a similar fashion. ZP-N is a feature of vertebrate and invertebrate egg coat proteins, as well as yeast mating recognition proteins, demonstrating its broad significance in sexual reproduction. Unexpectedly, we find that the ZP-N motifs of VEZP14 and VERL exhibit inverse patterns of co-evolution with lysin, suggesting that these duplicates may have opposite functions in fertilization. Using computer simulations, we model a novel explanation for this pattern whereby VEZP14 acts as a decoy of VERL in order to decrease the effective amount of sperm lysin and slow the rate of fertilization. Such molecular mimicry could complement other well-established fertilization blocks that females use to control rates of fertilization and limit polyspermy.
