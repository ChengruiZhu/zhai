 (MRSA). The aim of the study is to find out whether these characteristics are consistently similar among isolates variations of MRSA. The study used 30 various isolates of MRSA belong to 13 spa types and 5 MLST types and determined the aggregation, the adherence, and the production of biofilms and slime for each isolate. The methods used to evaluate these characteristics were a modified Congo red agar assay (MCRA), a microtiter plate assay (MPA), high-magnification light microscopy, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and PCR. The study found that isolates belonging to similar Spa, SCCmec, and ST types have similar abilities to produce biofilms; however, their ability to produce slime on CRA was found to be different. Moreover, isolates that have different Spa types showed high variation in their ability to produce biofilms. The results of light microscope revealed the isolates that produced strong and weak biofilms and formed similar aggregation on the glass surfaces. SEM results showed that all 30 MRSA isolates that were tested were 100% positive for biofilm formation, although to varying degrees. Further testing using PCR confirmed that 100% of the 30 isolates tested were positive for the presence of the
