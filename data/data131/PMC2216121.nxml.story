Properties of the whole-cell K+ currents and voltage-dependent activation and inactivation properties of single K+ channels in clonal pheochromocytoma (PC-12) cells were studied using the patch-clamp recording technique. Depolarizing pulses elicited slowly inactivating whole-cell K+ currents, which were blocked by external application of tetraethylammonium+, 4-aminopyridine, and quinidine. The amplitudes and time courses of these K+ currents were largely independent of the prepulse voltage. Although pharmacological agents and manipulation of the voltage-clamp pulse protocol failed to reveal any additional separable whole-cell currents in a majority of the cells examined, single-channel recordings showed that, in addition to the large Ca++- dependent K+ channels described previously in many other preparations, PC-12 cells had at least four distinct types of K+ channels activated by depolarization. These four types of K+ channels differed in the open- channel current-voltage relation, time course of activation and inactivation, and voltage dependence of activation and inactivation. These K+ channels were designated the Kw, Kz, Ky, and Kx channels. The typical chord conductances of these channels were 18, 12, 7, and 7 pS in the excised configuration using Na+-free saline solutions. These four types of K+ channels opened in the presence of low concentrations of internal Ca++ (1 nM). Their voltage-dependent gating properties can account for the properties of the whole-cell K+ currents in PC-12 cells.
