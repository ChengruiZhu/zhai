Severe trauma and the systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) occur as a result of a cytokine storm which is in part due to ATP released from damaged tissue. This pathology also leads to increased numbers of immature antigen presenting cells (APC) sharing properties of dendritic cells (DC) or macrophages (MÎ¦). The occurrence of immature APC appears to coincide with the reactivation of herpes virus infections such as Epstein Barr virus (EBV). The aim of this study was the comparative analysis of the ultrastructural and functional characteristics of such immature APC. In addition, we investigated EBV infection/ reactivation and whether immature APC might be targets for natural killers (NK). Significant macroautophagy, mitochondrial degradation and multivesicular body formation together with the identification of herpes virus particles were morphological findings associated with immature APC. Exogenous stressors such as ATP further increased morphological signs of autophagy, including LC3 expression. Functional tests using fluorescent bacteria proved impaired phagolysosome fusion. However, immature APC were susceptible to NK-92-mediated cytolysis. We found evidence for EBV latency state II infection by detecting EBV-specific LMP1 and EBNA2 in immature APC and in whole blood of these patients. In summary, trauma-induced cytokine storms may induce maturation arrest of APC, promote ATP-induced autophagy, support EBV persistence and impair the degradation of phagocytozed bacteria through inefficient phagolysosome fusion. The susceptibility to NK-mediated cytolysis supports the hypothesis that NK function is likely to contribute to immune reconstitution after major trauma by regulating immature APC, and ATP-induced autophagy and survival.
