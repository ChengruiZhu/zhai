A seventy-year-old male who underwent right-side inguinal hernia repair using the Lichtenstein method revisited our hospital with inguinodynia 16 months after surgery. After a thorough assessment, the patient was diagnosed with neuropathic pain based on the following: 1) dermatomal mapping suggested ilioinguinal and iliohypogastric nerve problems, 2) pain was evoked by specific movement, 3) the site of maximum pain was slightly changed at every physical examination, and 4) no evidence of recurrence or meshoma was observed on MRI. Conservative therapies were ineffective. Surgical intervention using laparoscopic retroperitoneal triple neurectomy was performed 4 months after treatment initiation. In the lateral recumbent position, a three-port method was used. The ilioinguinal and iliohypogastric nerves and the genital branch of the genitofemoral nerves were identified and resected. Although a residual nerve emerged from L2/3 toward the inguinal region, the nerve remained in situ. Pain assessment 3Â h after surgery revealed that pain was decreased but remained. Reoperation involving resection of the residual nerve was performed on the same day. Although another type of mild pain appeared 3 months after surgery, the patient resumed normal life, without any restrictions.
