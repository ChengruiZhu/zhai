The estimated rate of ED visits attributable to influenza was elevated during the H1N1/2009 pandemic period at 1,000 per 100,000 (95% confidence interval [CI] = 920 to 1,100) population compared to an average annual rate of 500 per 100,000 (95% CI = 450 to 550) for seasonal influenza. ILI or influenza was clinically diagnosed in one of 2.6 (38%) and one of 14 (7%) of these visits, respectively. While the ILI or clinical influenza diagnosis was the diagnosis most specific to influenza, only 87% and 58% of the clinically diagnosed ILI or influenza visits for pandemic and seasonal influenza, respectively, were likely directly due to an influenza infection. Rates for ILI ED visits were highest for younger age groups, while the likelihood of admission to hospital was highest in older persons. During periods of seasonal influenza activity, there was a significant increase in the number of persons who registered with nonrespiratory complaints, but left without being seen. This effect was more pronounced during the 2009 pandemic. The ratio of influenza-attributed respiratory visits to influenza-attributed ILI visits varied from 2.4:1 for the fall H1N1/2009 wave to 9:1 for the 2003/04 influenza A(H3N2) season and 28:1 for the 2007/08 H1N1 season.
