The expression levels of proteins are tightly regulated, not only via their production but also via their degradation. Genes are transcribed only if their encoded proteins are required by the environmental or developmental conditions of a cell, and once a certain protein is no longer needed, it is rapidly degraded by the ubiquitin proteasome system (UPS). Transcriptional activators appeared to contradict this simple economic principle, as it had been claimed that they had to be degraded in order to function. The claim was based upon a correlation: if the degradation of an activator was prevented by drugs or mutations in the UPS, the activator became stable but also nonfunctional. We have now shown that it is not the activator itself but its inhibitor that is the functionally relevant target of the UPS. Furthermore, we have found that the degradation of the inhibitor is controlled by a protein complex called Mediator. The activator is known to recruit Mediator to gene promoters, where Mediator assists RNA polymerase in initiating transcription. Mediator was always considered to be completely under the control of the activator; however, we observe that by regulating the degradation of the inhibitor, Mediator is also able to control the activator and thereby to orchestrate its own recruitment to gene promoters.
