The expression of multiple receptors on intestinal epithelial cells enables an actively targeted carrier to significantly enhance the oral delivery of payloads. Conjugating the receptors’ ligands on the surfaces of a particulate-delivery system allows site-specific targeting. Here, we used taurocholic acid (TCA) as a ligand for uptake of nanostructured lipid carriers (NLCs) mediated by a bile-acid transporter to improve oral bioavailability of curcumin (Cur). First, synthesis of TCA–polyethylene glycol 100–monostearate (S100-TCA) was carried out. Then, the physical and chemical properties of S100-TCA-modified Cur-loaded NLCs (Cur-TCA NLCs) with varying levels of S100-TCA modifications were investigated. Small particle size (<150 nm), high drug encapsulation (>90%), drug loading (about 3%), negative ζ-potential (−7 to −3 mV), and sustained release were obtained. In situ intestinal perfusion studies demonstrated improved absorption rate and permeability coefficient of Cur-TCA NLCs. Depending on the degree of modification, Cur-TCA NLCs displayed about a five- to 15-fold higher area under the curve in rats after oral administration than unmodified Cur NLCs, which established that the addition of S100-TCA to the NLCs boosted absorption of Cur. Further investigations of TCA NLCs might reveal a bright future for effective oral delivery of poorly bioavailable drugs.
