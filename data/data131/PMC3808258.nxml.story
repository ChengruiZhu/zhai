Autoimmune hepatitis is an inflammation of the liver characterized by the presence of peri-portal hepatitis, hypergammaglobulinemia, and the serum autoantibodies. The disease is classified into 2 distinct types according to the nature of auto-antibodies. Disturbances of the calcium-parathyroid hormone-vitamin D axis are frequently associated with chronic liver disease. Patients with AIH have a high prevalence of vitamin D deficiency. Genetic studies have provided the opportunity to determine which proteins link vitamin D to AIH pathology, namely, the major histocompatibility complex class II molecules, vitamin D receptors, toll-like receptors, cytotoxic T lymphocyte antigen-4, cytochrome P450 CYP2D6, regulatory T cells (Tregs) and the forkhead/winged helix transcription factor 3. Vitamin D also exerts its effect on AIH through non-genomic factors, namely, mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling pathways, γδT cells, interferon-gamma nitric oxide synthase, and reactive oxygen stress. In conclusion, vitamin D may have a beneficial role in AIH and improves liver function in concanavalin A-induced mouse AIH. Calcitriol is best used for AIH because it is the active form of a vitamin D
