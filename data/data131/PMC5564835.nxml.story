Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of Excision repair cross-complementing group 2 (ERCC2) gene are suspected to affect the risk of pancreatic cancer. Many studies have reported the association between ERCC2 Lys751Gln polymorphism (rs13181) and the susceptibility to pancreatic cancer, but the outcomes remained controversial. To comprehensively determine this association, we conducted a meta-analysis based on a total of eight studies. Evidence for this association was obtained from the PubMed, EMBASE, Web of Science and Chinese National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI) databases. In general, a significant association was found between ERCC2 rs13181 polymorphism and the susceptibility to pancreatic cancer in four genetic models [CC vs. AA: OR = 1.56, (95% CI: 1.28-1.90), P = 0.470; AC/CC vs. AA: OR=1.20, (95% CI: 1.06-1.36), P = 0.396; CC vs. AC/CC: OR = 1.50; (95% CI: 1.24-1.81), P = 0.530; C vs. A: OR=1.22, (95%CI:1.11-1.34), P = 0.159]. Furthermore, stratified analyses by ethnicity indicated a significant association only in the Asian population. Our results indicate that the ERCC2 Lys751Gln polymorphism might be important in stimulating the development of pancreatic cancer, especially for Asians.
