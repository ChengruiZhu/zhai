Ferric citrate is an approved phosphate binder for use in patients with chronic kidney disease on dialysis. Clinical trials demonstrated that ferric citrate controlled serum phosphorus levels and increased iron stores. The aim of this retrospective chart review was to evaluate real-world bone mineral and anemia parameter data from patients treated with ferric citrate. 92 adult dialysis patients taking ferric citrate (average starting dose of 6 tablets/day) for at least 6 months were included. Bone mineral, anemia, and iron biomarker levels were extracted from patient medical records before and during the first 6 months of ferric citrate treatment; 21 (23%) patients were phosphate binder naïve, and 71 (77%) patients had been on other phosphate binders. Before starting ferric citrate, 22% of patients had serum phosphorus ≤ 5.5 mg/dL, increasing to 65% of patients at 6 months of treatment (month 6). Mean (standard error of the mean (SEM)) baseline serum phosphorus was 6.55 ± 0.17 mg/dL decreasing to 5.40 ± 0.17 mg/dL at month 6. Mean (SEM) baseline hemoglobin, ferritin, and transferrin saturation were 10.6 ± 0.2 g/dL, 734 ± 65 ng/mL, and 27.1 ± 1.6%, respectively, and 11.1 ± 0.2 g/dL, 947 ± 66 ng/mL, and 37 ± 1.9%, respectively, at month 6. The serum phosphorus and anemia biomarker levels observed in this retrospective chart review were similar to those seen in clinical trials.
