Why do some parts of genes evolve slower than others? How can we account for the amino acid make-up of different parts of a protein? Answers to these questions are usually framed by reference to what the protein does and how it does it. This framework is, however, na√Øve. We now know that selection can act also on mRNA, for example, to ensure introns are removed properly. Here, we provide the first evidence that the way DNA works also affects gene and protein evolution. In living cells, most DNA wraps around histone protein structures to form nucleosomes, the basic building blocks of chromatin. Protein-coding sequence is no exception. Looking at genes in baker's yeast, we find that sequence between nucleosomes, linker sequence, is slow evolving. Both mutations that change the gene but not the protein and those that change gene and protein are affected. We argue that selection for correct nucleosome positioning, rather than differences in mutational processes, can explain this observation. Linker also exhibits distinct patterns of codon and amino acid usage, which reflect that DNA of linker needs to be rigid to prevent nucleosome formation. These results show that the way DNA works impacts on how genes evolve.
