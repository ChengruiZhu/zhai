Langerhans cell sarcoma (LCS) and quintuple cancers are extremely rare. In this report, a case of quintuple cancers including LCS was described. An 80‐year‐old man had squamous cell carcinoma of the nasal skin, colon and rectum adenocarcinomas, and T‐cell/histiocyte‐rich large B‐cell lymphoma. As swelling of multiple submental lymph nodes was observed, fine‐needle aspiration was carried out. Many large cells with high‐grade nuclear atypia and abundant cytoplasm were observed. Lymphocytes and eosinophils were observed in the background. Although a malignant tumor was suspected, a definite diagnosis could not be made. In a biopsy sample, the tumor cells were positive for vimentin, CD68, S‐100, CD1a, and CD163 and negative for epithelial, lymphocyte, and melanoma markers in immunohistochemistry. A diagnosis of LCS was made from the immunohistochemical findings and high mitotic rate with atypical forms. The patient died about 2 months after the first medical examination. Metastasis of LCS was confirmed in many organs by autopsy. LCS has a poor prognosis. In cases with the above‐described cytological findings, LCS should be added to the list of differential diagnosis. The cytological findings presented here may be useful for determining appropriate clinical management such as staging of the disease and follow‐up of the neoplasm. Diagn.
