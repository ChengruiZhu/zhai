The airspace compartment of the mammalian lung, comprised of spherical sacs termed alveoli, harbors the architecture, cellular composition, and molecular armamentarium to perform the critical function of gas exchange or oxygen uptake. Despite the necessity of this alveolar compartment for organismal viability, the mechanism by which alveoli are formed and maintained is obscure. Furthermore, no treatments are currently available that can regenerate the airspace once damaged. In this manuscript, we sought to determine whether hepatocyte growth factor, a cytokine with a functional armamentarium that subserves the critical events of alveolar formation (epithelial proliferation, migration, resistance from apoptosis and angiogenesis), could be an important mediator of alveolar formation and airspace maintenance. Our simple paradigm was that critical homeostatic pathways for the lung should operate both in lung formation and in lung maintenance/regeneration. Using an informative battery of mouse models and cell lines, we show that hepatocyte growth factor is a determinant of alveolar formation and that the enhancement of hepatocyte growth factor signaling can both protect and repair the airspace from pathologic airspace enlargement or emphysema.
