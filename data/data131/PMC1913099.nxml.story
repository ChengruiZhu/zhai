Microarray technology is commonly used to reveal genome-wide transcriptional changes in bacterial pathogens during interactions with the host. Clustering algorithms, which group genes with similar expression patterns, facilitate microarray data organization and are based on assumptions that co-expressed genes share common function or regulation; however, clustering solely by co-expression may not reveal all of the information contained in bacterial array data. We introduce neighbor clustering, a new tool for analyzing bacterial gene expression profiles, which distinguishes itself from other programs by incorporating details unique to the architecture of bacterial chromosomes into the analysis. Neighbor clustering combines two informative characteristics of bacterial genes that share common function or regulation—(1) similar expression profiles and (2) physical proximity on the chromosome—and extracts statistically significant clusters of gene neighbors that are potentially related by function or regulation. We present the analysis of microarray data from group A streptococci during adherence to human pharyngeal cells, the first overt infection step. We show that neighbor clustering identifies more differentially expressed genes than rigorous statistical analyses alone, and can provide functional clues about unknown genes. We extended the analysis to include a previously published streptococcal array study to demonstrate the applicability of the method.
