TRIM66 belongs to the family of tripartite motif (TRIM)-containing proteins. Alterations in TRIM proteins have been implicated in several malignancies. This study was aimed at elucidating the expression and biological function of TRIM66 in osteosarcoma. Here, TRIM66 expression level was higher in osteosarcoma tissues than in normal tissues. High TRIM66 expression was correlated with high rate of local recurrence and lung metastasis, and short survival time. Then, we found that knockdown of TRIM66 in two osteosarcoma cell lines, MG63 and HOS, significantly inhibited cell proliferation and induced G1-phase arrest. Moreover, inhibition of TRIM66 in osteosarcoma cells significantly induced cell apoptosis, while remarkably inhibited cell migration, invasion as well as tumorigenicity in nude mice. Gene set enrichment analysis in Gene Expression Omnibus dataset revealed that apoptosis, epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) signaling pathway-related genes were enriched in TRIM66 higher expression patients, which was confirmed by western blot analysis in osteosarcoma cells with TRIM66 silenced. In conclusion, TRIM66 may act as an oncogene through suppressing apoptosis pathway and promoting TGF-β signaling in osteosarcoma carcinogenesis. TRIM66 may be a prognostic factor and potential therapeutic target in osteosarcoma.
