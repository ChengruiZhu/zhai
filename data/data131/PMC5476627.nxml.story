Of 59,411 respondents who met study inclusion criteria, 7.7% reported receiving a diagnosis of uterine fibroids. Of these, 5,670 women (1,402 in the uterine fibroid group and 4,268 in the control group) were excluded from analysis because they had a hysterectomy. Among the non-hysterectomized study participants, 3,031 self-reported a diagnosis of uterine fibroids (prevalence: 5.8%, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 5.5%–6.1%); prevalence increased as women aged and was greatest in the 50–54 age group (11.4%; 95% CI: 10.4%–12.4%). In addition, prevalence was greater in black vs white women (9.8%; 95% CI: 8.7%–11.0% vs 5.4%; 95% CI: 5.1%–5.7%). A greater percentage of women with uterine fibroids (vs those without) experienced severe heavy menstrual bleeding (16.7% vs 7.7%), severe constipation/bloating/diarrhea (7.7% vs 4.7%), severe passage of clots (6.7% vs 2.4%), severe spotting/bleeding between periods (1.7% vs 1.0%), and severe pelvic pressure (1.6% vs 0.6%). Among uterine fibroid patients with these typical uterine fibroid-related symptoms, 56.4%, 32.3%, 26.4%, 25.8%, and 20.4% reported heavy menstrual bleeding, passage of clots, spotting/bleeding between periods, constipation/bloating/diarrhea, and pelvic pressure, respectively, as extremely bothersome.
