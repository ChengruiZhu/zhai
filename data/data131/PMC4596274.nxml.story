Fibrous dysplasia (FD) of bone is a rare skeletal disease often associated with bone pain, deformities and fractures. The bisphosphonate therapies are reported to be useful for bone pain, but seem to be not suitable for fracture repairs of extremities. This is the first report of zoledronate-induced radiological improvement and long bone fracture union in polyostotic FD. A 30-year-old Japanese female had bilateral shepherdâ€™s crook deformities typical to FD and right pathological femoral fracture and left humeral fracture nonunion. These fractures occurred without major traumas and the humeral fracture was not united for 1 year with conservative therapy. Laboratory blood test results were notable for elevated serum alkaline phosphatase and urine N-terminal cross-linking telopeptide of type I collagen. Her subtrochanteric femoral fracture was percutaneously fixed using Kirschner wires. After surgery, a hip spica cast was applied for 2 months and the orthosis for the next 2 months. Bony union of the femoral fracture was observed 5 months after surgery. Increased bone turnover and typical radiological features suggested that the constant elbow pain was due to both FD itself and humeral nonunion. Considering the possible side effects of zoledronate delaying acute fracture healing, we initiated zoledronate (Zometa
