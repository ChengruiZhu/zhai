Choosing between alternative options requires assigning and integrating values along a multitude of dimensions. For instance, when buying a car, different cars may vary for their price, quality, fuel economy and more. Solving this problem requires finding a common currency to allow integration of disparate value dimensions. In dynamic decisions, in which the environment changes continuously, this multi-dimensional integration must be updated over time. Despite many years of research, it is still unclear how the brain integrates value information and makes decisions in the presence of competing alternatives. In the current study, we propose a probabilistic theory that allows dynamically integrating value information into a common currency. It builds on successful models in motor control and decision-making. It is comprised of a series of control schemes with each of them attached to an individual goal, generating an optimal action-plan to achieve that goal starting from the current state. The key novelty is the relative desirability computation that integrates good- and action- values to a single dynamic variable that weighs the individual action-plans as a function of state and time. By dynamically integrating value information, our theory models many key results in movement decisions that have previously eluded a common explanation.
