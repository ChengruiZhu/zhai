The classical nonhomologous end-joining (C-NHEJ) DNA double-strand break (DSB) repair pathway employs the Ku70/80 complex (Ku) for DSB recognition and the XRCC4/DNA ligase 4 (Lig4) complex for ligation. During IgH class switch recombination (CSR) in B lymphocytes, switch (S) region DSBs are joined by C-NHEJ to form junctions either with short microhomologies (MHs; “MH-mediated” joins) or no homologies (“direct” joins). In the absence of XRCC4 or Lig4, substantial CSR occurs via “alternative” end-joining (A-EJ) that generates largely MH-mediated joins. Because upstream C-NHEJ components remain in XRCC4- or Lig4-deficient B cells, residual CSR might be catalyzed by C-NHEJ using a different ligase. To address this, we have assayed for CSR in B cells deficient for Ku70, Ku80, or both Ku70 and Lig4. Ku70- or Ku80-deficient B cells have reduced, but still substantial, CSR. Strikingly, B cells deficient for both Ku plus Lig4 undergo CSR similarly to Ku-deficient B cells, firmly demonstrating that an A-EJ pathway distinct from C-NHEJ can catalyze CSR end-joining. Ku-deficient or Ku- plus Lig4-deficient B cells are also biased toward MH-mediated CSR joins; but, in contrast to XRCC4- or Lig4-deficient B cells, generate substantial numbers of direct CSR joins. Our findings suggest that more than one form of A-EJ can function in CSR.
