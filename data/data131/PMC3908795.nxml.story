Feynmanâ€™s early vision in 1959 gave birth to the concept of nanotechnology. He saw it as an unavoidable development in the progress of science and said that there is plenty of room at the bottom. Since then, nanotechnology has been part of mainstream scientific theory with potential medical and dental applications. Numerous theoretical predictions have been made based on the potential applications of nanotechnology in dentistry, with varying levels of optimism. While a few layers of nanotechnologic capability have become a reality for oral health in the last decade, many of these applications are still in their puerile stage .The most substantial contribution of nanotechnology to dentistry till date, is the more enhanced restoration of tooth structure with nanocomposites. The field of nanotechnology has tremendous potential, which if harnessed efficiently, can bring out significant benefits to the human society such as improved health, better use of natural resources, and reduced environmental pollution. The future holds in store an era of dentistry in which every procedure will be performed using equipments and devices based on nanotechnology. This article reviews the current status and the potential clinical applications of nanotechnology in dentistry.
