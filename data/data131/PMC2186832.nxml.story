Compared with normal littermates, the op/op mice had very few macrophages in the peritoneal cavity and severely reduced numbers of monocytes in the peripheral blood. Moreover, osteopetrotic animals demonstrated an altered distribution of hemopoietic tissue with a 10- fold decrease in the number of marrow cells. Liver hemopoiesis persisted in 4-wk-old mice as evidenced by the presence of hemopoietic stem cells (HSC). Moreover, the concentration of HSC was decreased in marrow and increased in the spleen of op/op mice. In spite of the paucity of cells of monocyte-macrophage lineage in vivo, progenitor cells from hemopoietic tissues of op/op mice formed increased numbers of monocyte-macrophage colonies in vitro in the presence of exogenous colony-stimulating activity (CSA). The source of this critical CSA was a medium conditioned by stromal fibroblastoid colonies formed in vitro by normal marrow cells. Therefore, these data suggest that op/op mice possess normal monocyte-macrophage-osteoclast progenitor cells but these cells are unable to fully differentiate in the op/op mouse microenvironment. In support of this, in cultures of stromal fibroblastoid colonies from op/op marrow or spleen, the concomitant growth of macrophages, normally very dense, was drastically reduced. Moreover, transplantation of op/op spleen cells into lethally irradiated littermate recipients resulted in their hemopoietic reconstitution without signs of macrophage defect. Thus, the op/op splenic cells do not transfer the disease and are capable of normal differentiation in normal in vivo environment. These observations support the hypothesis that the defect in op/op mice is a result of the failure of hemopoietic stromal fibroblastoid cells to release sufficient amounts of CSA necessary for normal differentiation of cells of the monocyte-macrophage lineage.
