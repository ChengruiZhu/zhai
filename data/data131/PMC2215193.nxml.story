The concentration of guanosine 3',5'-cyclic monophosphate (cyclic GMP) has been examined in suspensions of freshly isolated frog rod outer segments using conditions which previously have been shown to maintain the ability of outer segments to perform a light-induced permeability change (presence of calf serum, anti-oxidant, and low calcium concentration). Illumination causes a rapid decrease in cyclic GMP levels which has a half-time approximately 125 ms. With light exposures that bleach less than 100 rhodopsin molecules in each rod outer segment, at least 10(4)-10(5) molecules of cyclic GMP are hydrolyzed for each rhodopsin molecule bleached. Half of the total cyclic GMP in each outer segment, approximately 2 X 10(7) molecules, is contained in the light-sensitive pool. If outer segments are exposed to continuous illumination, using intensities which bleach between 5.0 X 10(1) and 5.0 X 10(4) rhodopsin molecules/outer segment per second, cyclic GMP levels fall to a value characteristic for the intensity used. This suggests that a balance between synthesis and degradation of cyclic GMP is established. This constant level appears to be regulated by the rate of bleaching rhodopsin molecules (by the intensity of illumination), not the absolute number of rhodopsin molecules bleached...
