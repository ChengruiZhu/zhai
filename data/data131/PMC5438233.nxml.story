In light of recent warnings by the United States (US) Surgeon General and Centers for Disease Control (CDC) guidelines for recommending more prudent use of opioid narcotics, the search for a non-opioid alternative for aborting acute migraines is particularly relevant. The CDC also estimates the prevalence of opioid dependence may be as high as 26% among patients prescribed opioids for chronic pain, not due to cancer, in the primary care setting. Given such staggering data, it is imperative that we, as caretakers, not foster opioid dependence but rather continue to investigate non-opioid therapies for the management of acute migraines in the emergent care settings. Our literature review demonstrates that metoclopramide should be used more frequently as first-line therapy for an acute migraine over opioids. The use of opioids specifically has been discouraged as migraine treatment by the American Headache Society citing “insufficient evidence” as the main reason. Metoclopramide, specifically using the 10 mg dose, has been cited as “highly likely to be effective” by the same guidelines. Another major issue with opioids is the growing potential for abuse, thus minimizing the use of these drugs for only special circumstances would be beneficial overall.
