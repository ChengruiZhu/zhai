The eukaryotic genome is packaged into a periodic nucleoprotein complex known as chromatin. Wrapping of DNA around nucleosomes, the basic repeat unit of chromatin, enables packing of long stretches of DNA into a compact nucleus but also impedes access by protein factors involved in essential cellular processes such as transcription, replication, recombination and repair. Chromatin remodeling factors are multi-protein complexes that utilize the energy released during ATP-hydrolysis to assemble, reposition, restructure and disassemble nucleosomes. These complexes disrupt histone-DNA contacts to ‘remodel’ the chromatin and grant access to the genome. Alternatively, access can also be denied to repress transcription, for example. Spermatogenesis, the developmental program that produces sperm, comprises a dramatic chromatin makeover and the induction of a transcriptional program that engages nearly one-third of the genome. Here we provide evidence suggesting that these large-scale alterations leave the genomic material vulnerable to spurious transcriptional changes which are normally repressed by ACF1 (BAZ1A in mammals), the defining member of the well-studied ACF/CHRAC chromatin remodeling complex. These findings indicate that
