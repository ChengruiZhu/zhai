. When the renal threshold is not exceeded by the hemoglobin in the blood there is little or no excess iron deposited in the kidney but when superthreshold doses of blood hemoglobin are given the epithelium of the convoluted tubules accumulates much iron and the iron analyses may show 5 times normal values. The normal dog (140 to 150 per cent hemoglobin) has a large reserve store of iron in the liver, spleen and marrow. Diets may modify this storage of iron in these tissues. To bring conclusive proof relating to the individual diet factors, the reserve store of iron should be depleted by an anemia period of 2 to 3 months. Complete removal of red cells from tissue capillaries is essential for accurate iron assays of fresh tissue. The method described accomplishes this without causing gross tissue edema. The lowest iron content is observed in the pancreas, stomach, jejunum, colon and urinary bladder. These figures average from 1 to 2 mg. iron per 100 gm. fresh tissue. This shows that smooth muscle and mucous membranes contain little iron. Striated muscle (heart, psoas) shows a relatively low iron content but uniform values close to 4 mg. per 100 gm. tissue. Lungs show a considerable fluctuation with low iron values in anemia (3.7 mg.) and higher values in health (6 to 7 mg.). The
