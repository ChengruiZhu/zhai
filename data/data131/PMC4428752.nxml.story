Although the accuracy of these findings is likely to be limited by the use of publicly available records of drug approvals and by the use of commercial sales records, the study’s results support concerns about the marketing and use of FDCs in India. They indicate that large numbers of unapproved formulations are available for three of the four therapeutic areas examined, and that sales volumes of these unapproved FDCs (including FDCs that included internationally banned or restricted drugs) are high. The researchers make several recommendations to remedy this situation, which in their view risks harming patients. Sale and manufacture of unapproved FDC formulations, they suggest, should be banned immediately. Withdrawal from the market should be staged, with priority given to removing those formulations containing drugs that are banned or restricted internationally. Manufacturers who wish to retain specific FDCs on the market should be required to submit approval applications to the CDSCO. If this recommendation is implemented, the researchers note, clinicians will need to review the needs of patients taking unapproved FDCs and provide appropriate alternatives. To ensure in the long-term the safety and effectiveness of new medicines marketed in India, as well as transparency of the approval process, the researchers call for amendments in India’s regulatory processes and drug laws. They also suggest that a review should be undertaken of the safety and effectiveness of FDCs currently available in India.
