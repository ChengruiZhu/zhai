In the study group, sinus rhythm restoration rate in the early postoperative period was 63%, but at the time of discharge it reduced to 29%; after 6 months, it significantly increased to 72% and after 3 years, to 81% (p=0.02). In the control group, the sinus rhythm restored only in 14% after 1 year, and at 3 years, it was 22%, although in the early postoperative period it, was 43%. Analysis of left atrial size before and after surgery showed that dimension significantly reduced in both groups (study group, p=0.013; control group, p=0.024). In addition, in patients undergoing surgical RFA procedure, there was a significant association between shorter heart disease history (p=0.02) and shorter AF history (p=0.074) with maintenance of sinus rhythm. The mortality rate in the study group was 4% (two patients) and in the control group 5% (five patients). Comparison of QOL measures between study and control groups after 1 year showed that patients undergoing concomitant atrial reduction surgery and RFA had significant improvement of QOL physical (p=0.03) and role (p=0.03) functioning, heartbeat (p=0.01), general (p=0.03) and mental health (p=0.01), vitality (p=0.007), and social role (p=0.02) functioning measures as compared to preoperative state, being higher than in patients who underwent only mitral valve surgery.
