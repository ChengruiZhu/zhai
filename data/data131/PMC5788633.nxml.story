The aim of this study was to systematically evaluate the association between D-dimer level and the risk of stroke through performing a meta-analysis. PubMed, Web of Science, EMBASE and Cochrane Library were searched for potentially eligible literature. Prospective observational studies or case-control studies were included. The study characteristics and relevant data were extracted. Hazard ratios (HRs) or odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were pooled to estimate the association between D-dimer level and the risk of stroke. Seven prospective studies with 22,207 patients and three case-control studies with 2,248 patients were included. For the prospective studies, the pooled HRs of higher D-dimer level for all types of stroke, ischemic stroke and hemorrhagic stroke were 1.55 (95% CI, 1.28- 1.87), 1.62 (95% CI, 1.18-2.22) and 1.30 (95% CI, 0.63-2.68), respectively. The pooled HRs per SD increase in log D-dimer for all types of stroke, ischemic stroke and hemorrhagic stroke were 1.16 (95% CI, 1.06-1.26), 1.11 (95% CI, 1.03-1.21) and 1.11 (95% CI, 0.95-1.30), respectively. For the case-control studies, the pooled OR of higher D-dimer level for acute ischemic stroke was 2.06 (95% CI, 1.08-3.96). No significant publication bias was found in the meta-analysis. In conclusion, our results suggested that higher D-dimer level was associated with higher risk of stroke, especially ischemic stroke.
