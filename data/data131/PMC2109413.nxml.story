Repeated thrombin treatment of washed platelets prepared from rabbits can decrease the serotonin content of the platelets by about 80%. When these platelets are deaggregated they reaccumulate serotonin but their storage capacity for serotonin is reduced by about 60%. If thrombin- pretreated platelets are allowed to equilibrate with a high concentration of serotonin (123 mu M), they release a smaller percentage of their total serotonin upon further thrombin treatment, in comparison with the percentage of serotonin released from control platelets equilibrated with the same concentration of serotonin calculations indicate that in thrombin-treated platelets reequilibrated with serotonin, two-thirds of the serotonin is in the granule compartment and one-third is in the extragranular compartment, presumably the cytoplasm. Analysis of the exchange of serotonin between the suspending fluid and the platelets showed that thrombin treatment does not alter the transport rate of serotonin across the platelet membrane and does not cause increased diffusion of serotonin from the platelets into the suspending fluid. The primary reason for the reduced serotonin accumulation by the thrombin-treated platelets appears to be loss of amine storage granules or of the storage capacity within the granules.
