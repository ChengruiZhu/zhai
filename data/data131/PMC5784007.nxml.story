G cells in the antrum region of the murine stomach produce gastrin, the central hormone for controlling gastric activities. Secretion of gastrin is induced mainly by protein breakdown products but also by distensions of the stomach wall. Although G cells respond to protein fragments via distinct chemosensory receptor types, the mechanism underlying G cell activation upon distention is entirely ambiguous. Mechanosensitive ion channels are considered as potential candidates for such a task. Therefore, we explore the possibility of whether Piezo1, a polymodal sensor for diverse mechanical forces, is expressed in antral G cells. The experimental analyses revealed that the vast majority of G cells indeed expressed Piezo1. Within flask-like G cells at the base of the antral invaginations, the Piezo1 protein was primarily located at the basolateral portion, which is thought to be the release site for the exocytic secretion of gastrin. In the spindle-like G cells, which are oriented parallel to the invaginations, Piezo1 protein was restricted to the cell body where the hormone was also located, whereas the long processes appeared to be devoid of Piezo1 protein. Our results suggest that mechanosensitive channels such as Piezo1, located in close proximity to hormone-release sites, enable G cells to respond directly to antrum distensions with gastrin secretion.
