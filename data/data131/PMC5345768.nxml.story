 must, as a single-celled microorganism, rapidly respond to changes in its environment and carefully balance its energy needs with the available resources. One of the major energy-consuming processes in the cell is the production of ribosomes. Ribosome biogenesis is highly dynamic and complex and requires the coordinated action of myriads of factors and RNAs. It begins with the synthesis of the precursor ribosomal RNA (rRNA), which is concurrently cleaved, modified, folded, and assembled together with ribosomal proteins into mature ribosomal subunits. It is known that in response to depletion of nutrients, yeast quickly represses the transcription of genes encoding rRNAs and ribosomal proteins. In this study, we reveal that yeast also rapidly switches to an alternative rRNA processing pathway, in which the precursor rRNA is cleaved differently and the ribosome biogenesis is arrested at a distinct stage. We demonstrate that the choice between the two alternative pathways is controlled by the target of rapamycin complex 1 (TORC1) and casein kinase 2 (CK2) kinase, but does not require Tap42p and Sch9p, which are currently thought to be the major effectors of TORC1. Our results indicate the existence of a so far unidentified branch of TORC1 signaling regulating ribosomes biogenesis at the posttranscriptional level.
