Primary Fallopian tube carcinoma (PFTC) is a rare but highly aggressive disease. Currently, treatments are similar to those used in epithelial ovarian carcinoma (EOC), however, there are distinct differences between the two diseases. PFTC tends to recur in the retroperitoneal nodes and distant sites more often than EOC. Limited literature with regard to effective agents in platinum-resistant and -refractory (Pt-R) disease exists, particularly after two lines of consecutive treatment. In this case report, a 47-year-old female with PFTC exhibited recurrence in the liver after postoperative chemotherapy. The patient received paclitaxel and cisplatin combination as first-line chemotherapy and topotecan as a second-line treatment, which is considered platinum-refractory. After the second-line treatment failed, this patient received a gemcitabine plus cisplatin combination as third-line chemotherapy for a total of 6 cycles. The liver metastases regressed rapidly and completely. The patientâ€™s progression-free survival (PFS) was 10 months and overall survival (OS) was 45 months. In conclusion, gemcitabine and cisplatin combination is an effective regimen for refractory PFTC even after the failure of two previous lines of consecutive chemotherapy and this warrants further independent investigation.
