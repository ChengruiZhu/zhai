Coronary artery stenosis is a rare phenomenon in children. Coronary stent implantation is generally not considered a standard treatment option due to technical difficulties and potential complications in this group of patients. Nevertheless, several pediatric cases reporting successful implantation with acceptable short-term experiences have been described. The following case presents a successful stent implantation for left main coronary artery (LMCA) stenosis early after surgery for anomalous left coronary artery from pulmonary artery (ALCAPA) at the age of 6 months. The excellent mid-term results and notably the procedure's potential as a longterm treatment in small children are highlighted. A 6-month-old infant underwent surgery for ALCAPA. Due to sudden postoperative deterioration, cardiac catheterization was performed. Coronary angiography revealed severe (90%) ostial LMCA stenosis. A PROMUS drug-eluting stent (Promus Element AL3.0 Ã— 8 mm, Boston Scientific, Natick, Massachusetts, USA) was implanted. The procedure was performed without complications. Antiplatelet therapy with acetylsalicylic acid and clopidogrel was initiated. Subsequently, cardiac function improved slowly. Cardiac catheterization 3 years 8 months after stent implantation showed no restenosis with a proximal LMCA diameter still at the 50
