Hypertension is the most prevalent cardiovascular disease of adults and is a major risk factor for cardiovascular (CV) and cerebrovascular morbidity and mortality worldwide. Treatment of hypertension leads to reduction of CV morbidity and mortality through blood pressure reduction. The role of renin–angiotensin–aldosterone system (RAAS) in the pathophysiology of hypertension is mainly through generation of potent vasoconstrictor angiotensin II, stimulation of aldosterone secretion, and increase in sympathetic activation. Angiotensin II receptor blockers such as candesartan, a long-acting agent, alter this system by blocking the activation of angiotensin I receptors. Several important clinical trials have tested the efficacy of candesartan with placebo, antihypertensive agents, or other agents that block the RAAS for the control of hypertension and reduction of key CV risk factors such as microalbuminuria, heart failure, retinopathy, and carotid intima medial thickness. Candesartan has been shown to be a well-tolerated and effective antihypertensive agent with positive metabolic characteristics and additional benefits on CV and cerebrovascular outcomes. The aim of this review is to discuss the pharmacology, efficacy, and safety of candesartan, with an overview of key hypertension and CV studies involving candesartan.
