In many areas of science and technology, patterned films and surfaces play a key role in engineering and development of advanced materials. Here, we present a versatile toolbox that provides an easy patterning method for cellulose thin films by means of photolithography and enzymatic digestion. A patterned UV-illumination of trimethylsilyl cellulose thin films containing small amounts of a photo acid generator leads to a desilylation reaction and thus to the formation of cellulose in the irradiated areas. Depending on the conditions of development, either negative and positive type cellulose structures can be obtained, offering lateral resolutions down to the single-digit micro meter range by means of contact photolithography. In order to highlight the potential of this material for advanced patterning techniques, cellulose structures with sub-Âµm resolution are fabricated by means of two-photon absorption lithography. Moreover, these photochemically structured cellulose thin films are successfully implemented as dielectric layers in prototype organic thin film transistors. Such photopatternable dielectric layers are crucial for the realization of electrical interconnects for demanding organic device architectures.
