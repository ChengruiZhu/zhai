Musculoskeletal disorders are very common in the dental practice. This cross-sectional study assessed the nature and prevalence of musculoskeletal symptoms (MS) and their associated risk factors among dentists in three types of clinics in Riyadh. A structured, self-administered questionnaire about demographic characteristics, nature of work, and prevalence and frequency of MS was completed by 274 male and 241 female dentists. Chi-square and logistic regression were used to determine the association of MS with a number of important variables. Pain in the lower back (64%) and neck (60%) were the most prevalent MS. Working in the dental colleges’ clinics was associated with increased risk of MS (adjusted OR 2.30, 95% CI 1.27–4.18). A stronger association was observed for dentists working in the private clinics (adjusted OR 2.58, 95% CI 1.28–5.17) compared to government clinics. Female dentists were at more risk of MS than the male dentists (OR 1.63, 95%CI 1.02–2.59). The OR of MS for dentists treating more than 10 patients/d was 1.53 (95%CI 0.83–2.81). The higher risk of reported MS in females and for those working in the dental colleges and private clinics underscores the importance of recognition and prevention of MS even early in the dental profession.
