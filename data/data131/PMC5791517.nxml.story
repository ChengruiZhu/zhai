The aim of this meta-analysis was to compare the functional outcomes of patients with a distal radius fracture with and without a concomitant fracture of the ulnar styloid process. A systematic literature search was performed to identify all studies comparing patients with a distal radius fracture with and without an ulnar styloid process fracture. The initial search revealed 511 articles, of which 12 articles with a total of 2243 patients were included; 1196 patients with and 1047 patients without an ulnar styloid process fracture. A statistically significant mean difference of 3.40 points (95% CI 1.33â€“5.48) in the Disability of the Arm, Shoulder, and Hand score was found in favour of patients without an ulnar styloid process fracture. This difference is less than 10 and therefore not clinically important. No significant difference was found in Patient-Rated Wrist Evaluation scores, range of motion, grip strength, visual analogue scale pain scores, ulnar-sided wrist pain and distal radio-ulnar joint instability between patients with and without an ulnar styloid process fracture after 1 year of follow-up. Moreover, no significant differences were found between ulnar styloid base and nonbase fractures.
