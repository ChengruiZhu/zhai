Large GWAS have identified tens or even hundreds of common SNPs significantly associated with individual complex diseases; however, these SNPs typically explain a small proportion of phenotypic variance. Recently, heritability analyses based on GWAS data suggest that common SNPs have the potential to explain substantially larger fraction of phenotypic variance and to improve the genetic risk prediction. Because of the polygenic nature, improving genetic risk prediction for complex diseases typically requires substantially increasing the sample size in the discovery set. Thus, it is crucial to develop more efficient algorithms using existing GWAS summary data. In this article, we extend the polygenic risk score (PRS) method by adjusting the marginal effect size of SNPs for winner’s curse and by incorporating external functional annotation data. Theoretical analysis and simulation studies show that the performance improvement depends on the genetic architecture of the trait, sample size of the discovery sample set and the degree of enrichment of association for SNPs annotated as “high-prior” and the linkage disequilibrium patterns of these SNPs. We applied our method to the summary data of 14 GWAS. Our method achieved 25–50% gain in efficiency (measured in the prediction R
