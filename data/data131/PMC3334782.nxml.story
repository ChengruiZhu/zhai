A 51-year-old man with a five-year history of alcoholic cirrhosis was admitted for acute respiratory failure, platypnoea and severe hypoxaemia requiring emergency tracheal intubation. Following mechanical ventilation, hypoxaemia remained refractory to positive end-expiratory pressure, 100% of inspired oxygen and inhaled nitric oxide. Two-dimensional contrast-enhanced (agitated saline) transthoracic echocardiography disclosed a massive right-to-left extracardiac shunt, without patent foramen ovale. Contrast computed tomography (CT) of the thorax using quantitative analysis and colour encoding system established the diagnosis of acute respiratory distress syndrome aggravated by hepatopulmonary syndrome. According to the severity of the respiratory condition, a veno-venous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation was implemented and the patient was listed for emergency liver transplantation. Orthotopic liver transplantation was performed at Day 13. At the end of the surgical procedure, the improvement in oxygenation allowed removal of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (Day 5). The patient was discharged from hospital at Day 48. Three months after hospital discharge, the patient recovered a correct physical autonomy status without supplemental O
