 Electrophoretic patterns of normal dog plasma in veronal buffer at pH 8.5 are shown to be essentially similar to patterns of human plasma. Dog albumin has a higher mobility than human albumin and in a mixture of dog and human plasmas migrates as a partially separated peak. Normal dog plasma frequently shows four alpha globulin peaks. Rates of restoration of plasma protein components in dogs subjected to acute plasmapheresis have been studied by electrophoresis. During the first 24 hours following such acute depletion, appreciable quantities of all electrophoretic components of the plasma proteins enter the circulating blood stream even when food is not given and has not been given for 12 hours before plasmapheresis. In such fasting periods albumin and total globulin appear in approximately the proportions present in normal plasma. Alpha and beta globulins continue relatively elevated during subsequent days in which caloric and protein intakes are adequate for weight and nitrogen gains. Initial albumin levels, however, are regained more slowly than those of total globulin. The relative proportions of the electrophoretic components of plasma proteins may be disturbed from normal following a single acute depletion for as long as 2 to 3 weeks
