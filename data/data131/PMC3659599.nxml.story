 is graded according to its shape and the quality of its internal tissue. A variety of grades are sold with prices according to grade. If an inferior raw ginseng is purchased, the consumer experience an economic loss. This research was conducted in order to explore the possibility of developing a noninvasive method for investigating raw ginsengâ€™s internal tissue. It has been determined that computed tomography (CT) scanner images agreed with actual cross-sections of raw ginseng. CT images were obtained to assess the internal portions of raw ginseng, and CT scans of raw ginseng were thoroughly measured using the Hounsfield unit (HU) system, since it allows for a more detailed analysis compared to nuclear magnetic resonance imaging. HU is a measure of attenuation used for CT images, with each pixel being assigned a value using a scale on which air is defined as -1000, water as 0 and compact bone as +1000. It takes about one second to process are slice and produce an image of the raw ginseng by a one channel CT scanner. An image good enough to discriminate the internal tissues can be obtained in 1/24 seconds with a one-channel CT scanner. Using this method, images of raw ginseng can be obtained and the characteristics of the internal tissues can be observed in a short time.
