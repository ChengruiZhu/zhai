Bone marrow transplantation is used to examine survival, hematopoietic stem cell function and pathology in recipients of young and old wild type bone marrow derived stem cells (BMDSCs) as well as cells from p53-based models of premature aging. There is no difference in the long term survival of recipients of 8 week-old p53+/m donor cells compared to recipients of 8 week-old wild-type (WT) donor cells (70 weeks) or of recipients of 16â€“18 weeks-old donor cells from either p53+/m or WT mice. There is shorter survival in recipients of older versus younger WT donor bone marrow, but the difference is only significant when comparing 8 and 18 week-old donors. In the p44-based model, short term survival/engraftment is significantly reduced in recipients of 11 month-old p44 donor cells compared to 4 week-old p44 or wild type donor cells of either age; mid-life survival at 40 weeks is also significantly less in recipients of p44 cells. BMDSCs are readily detectable within recipient bone marrow, lymph node, intestinal villi and liver sinusoids, but not in epithelial derived cells. These results indicate that recipients of young BMDSCs may survive longer than recipients of old bone marrow, but the difference is marginal at best.
