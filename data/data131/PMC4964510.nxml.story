Dietary selenium putatively prevents oxidative damage, whereas excessive selenium may lead to animal disorder. In this study, we investigated the effects of low and excessive levels of dietary selenium on oxidative stress and mitochondrial proteins in mouse liver. Six to eight week old mice were fed a diet with low, excessive, or moderate (control) levels of selenium (sodium selenite). The selenium concentration and oxidative stress-related parameters in hepatic mitochondria were evaluated. Two-dimensional electrophoresis and mass spectrometry were applied to identify the differentially-expressed proteins associated with dietary selenium. The selenium content of the livers in mice with the low selenium diet was significantly lower than that of the control, while that of mice fed excessive levels was significantly higher. In both groups oxidative stress in hepatic mitochondria was found; accompanied by lower superoxide dismutase (SOD) and glutathione peroxidase (GPX) levels and higher malondialdehyde (MDA) content, compared with the control group. Furthermore, ten proteins in the hepatic mitochondria of the selenium-low or -excessive groups with more than two-fold differences in abundance compared with the control group were identified. The differentially-expressed proteins in hepatic mitochondria may be associated with dietary (low or excessive) selenium-induced oxidative stress.
