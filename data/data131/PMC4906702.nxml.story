Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) have emerged as key regulatory molecules at almost every level of gene expression regulation. The altered expression of lncRNAs is a characteristic of numerous types of cancer, and lncRNAs have been demonstrated to promote the development, invasion and metastasis of tumors through various mechanisms. However, the role of lncRNAs in papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC) remain unclear. In the present study, differentially expressed lncRNAs and mRNAs were detected by human lncRNA microarray in three pairs of PTC and adjacent noncancerous samples. The microarray results revealed that 675 lncRNAs and 751 mRNAs were abnormally expressed in the three PTC samples compared with adjacent noncancerous samples (fold change â‰¥2.0; P<0.05). To validate the microarray results, 8 differentially expressed lncRNAs were randomly selected for quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR). The results of qPCR were consistent with the microarray data; the 8 lncRNAs had an aberrant expression in the PTC samples compared with the adjacent noncancerous samples. Gene ontology and pathway analysis indicated that there were 7 downregulated pathways and 29 upregulated pathways in PTC. LncRNA classification and subgroup analysis revealed 7 pairs of enhancer-like lncRNA-mRNA, 9 pairs of antisense lncRNA-mRNA and 45 pairs of lncRNA-mRNA were differentially expressed between PTC and their paired noncancerous samples. In conclusion, the present study identified a series of novel PTC-associated lncRNAs. Further study with these lncRNAs is instrumental for the identification of novel target molecules that could lead to improved diagnosis and treatment for PTC.
