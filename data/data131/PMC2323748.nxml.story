 1. Bees respond by a characteristic reflex to a movement in their visual field. By confining the field to a series of parallel dark and luminous bars it is possible to determine the size of bar to which the bees respond under different conditions and in this way to measure the resolving power or visual acuity of the eye. The maximum visual acuity of the bee is lower than the lowest human visual acuity. Under similar, maximal conditions the fineness of resolution of the human eye is about 100 times that of the bee. 2. The eye of the bee is a mosaic composed of hexagonal pyramids of variable apical angle. The size of this angle determines the angular separation between adjacent ommatidia and therefore sets the structural limits to the resolving power of the eye. It is found that the visual angle corresponding to the maximum visual acuity as found experimentally is identical with the structural angular separation of adjacent ommatidia in the region of maximum density of ommatidia population. When this region of maximum ommatidia population is rendered non-functional by being covered with an opaque paint, the maximum visual acuity then corresponds to the angular separation of those remaining ommatidia which now constitute the maximum density of population. 3. The angular separation of adjacent ommatidia is much smaller in the vertical (dorso-ventral) axis than in the horizontal (anterio-posterior) axis. The experimentally found visual acuity varies correspondingly. From this and other experiments as well as from the shape of the eye itself, it is shown that the bee's eye is essentially an instrument for uni-directional visual resolution, functional along the dorso-ventral axis. The resolution of the visual pattern is therefore determined by the vertical angular separation of those ocular elements situated in the region of maximum density of ommatidia population. 4. The visual acuity of the bee varies with the illumination in much the same way that it does for the human eye. It is low at low illuminations; as the intensity of illumination increases it increases at first slowly and then rapidly; and finally at high intensities it becomes constant. The resolving power of a structure like the bee's eye depends on the distance which separates the discrete receiving elements. The data then mean that at low illuminations the distance between receiving elements is large and that this distance decreases as the illumination increases. Since such a moving system cannot be true anatomically it must be interpreted functionally. It is therefore proposed that the threshold of the various ommatidia are not the same but that they vary as any other characteristic of a population. The visual acuity will then depend on the distance apart of those elements whose thresholds are such that they are functional at the particular illumination under investigation. Taking due consideration of the angular separation of ommatidia it is possible to derive a distribution curve for the thresholds of the ommatidia which resembles the usual probability curves, and which describes the data with complete fidelity.
