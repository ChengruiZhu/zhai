Two lactose-binding lectins from chicken tissues, chicken-lactose- lectin-1 (CLL-1) and chicken-lactose-lectin-11 (CLL-11) were quantified with a radioimmunoassay in extracts of a number of developing and adult chicken tissues. Both lectins could be measured in the same extract without separation, because they showed not significant immunological cross-reactivity. Many embryonic and adult tissues, including brain, heart, intestine, kidney, liver, lung, muscle, pancreas, and spleen, contained one or both lectins, although their concentrations differed markedly. For example, embryonic muscle, the richest source of CLL-1 contained only traces of CLL-11 whereas embryonic kidney, a very rich source of CLL-11 contained substantial CLL-1. In both muscle and kidney, lectin levels in adulthood were much lower than in the embryonic state. In contrast, CLL-1 in liver and CLL-11 in intestine were 10-fold to 30-fold more concentrated in the adult than in the 15-d embryo. CLL-1 and CLL-11 from several tissues were purified by affinity chromatography and their identity in the various tissues was confirmed by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, isoelectric focusing, and peptide mapping. The results suggest that these lectins might have different functions in the many developing and adult tissues in which they are found.
