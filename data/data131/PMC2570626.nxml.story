The detailed positions of nucleosomes along genomes have critical roles in transcriptional regulation. Consequently, it is important to understand the principles that govern the organization of nucleosomes in vivo and the functional consequences of this organization. Here we report on progress in identifying the functional consequences of nucleosome organization, in understanding the way in which nucleosome organization is encoded in the DNA, and in linking the two, by suggesting that distinct transcriptional behaviors are encoded through the genome's intrinsic nucleosome organization. Our results thus provide insight on the broader question of understanding how transcriptional programs are encoded in the DNA sequence. These new insights were enabled by individually sequencing âˆ¼380,000 nucleosomes from yeast in their entirety. Using this map, we refine our previous model for predicting nucleosome positions and demonstrate that our new model predicts nucleosome organizations in yeast with high accuracy and that its nucleosome positioning signals are predictive across eukaryotes. We show that the yeast genome may utilize these nucleosome positioning signals to encode regions with both relatively open (nucleosome-depleted) chromatin organizations and relatively closed (nucleosome-covered) chromatin organizations and that this encoding can partly explain aspects of transcription factor binding, gene expression, transcriptional noise, and DNA replication.
