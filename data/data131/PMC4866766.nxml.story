Deposition of extracellular materials next to a cell can protect the cell, change its morphology, or help it to move and communicate. To be able to perform such functions, extracellular materials must be deposited very precisely, but how cells achieve such precision is mostly unknown. A beautiful example of a very precisely deposited extracellular structure is the wall surrounding pollen grains. Pollen from different species often looks remarkably different–in part, because wall materials are deposited at some places on pollen surface and absent from others. The places where the wall is absent are called apertures and they are species-specific in shape, number, and positions. This suggests that developing pollen consistently marks some of its surface regions as different from the rest of the surface to allow them to develop into apertures. Aperture number and positions were long thought to be determined by geometric arrangement of pollen precursors arising during meiotic division and by the number of last-contact points between these cells. Here we challenge this model by using Arabidopsis mutants with abnormal arrangement of meiotic products or the number of last-contact points and by demonstrating that these factors are neither necessary nor sufficient for aperture placement. In contrast, we find that a mechanism sensitive to pollen ploidy–with cells responding to factors dependent either on ploidy itself or on cell size–is very important for aperture number and positions.
