Ribosomes are the molecular machines that generate proteins from mRNA templates. The biogenesis of eukaryotic ribosomes is an outstandingly complex process, in which around 80 ribosomal proteins and four ribosomal RNAs are accurately pieced together. Actively growing yeast cells must produce more than 160â€™000 ribosomal proteins per minute in order to meet the cellular demand for new ribosomes. Many ribosomal proteins are prone to aggregation and need therefore to be protected on their path from the cytoplasm to their mostly nuclear incorporation sites within ribosome precursors. Recent evidence has highlighted that specific binding partners, referred to as dedicated chaperones, may ensure the soluble expression, nuclear import and/or correct assembly of ribosomal proteins. Here, we have identified such a dedicated chaperone, termed Acl4, which exclusively interacts with and accompanies the ribosomal protein Rpl4 to its nuclear assembly site. Notably, Acl4 has the capacity to recognize Rpl4 as it is synthesized by the ribosome. Our findings emphasize that co-translational capturing of ribosomal proteins by dedicated chaperones is an advantageous strategy to provide sufficient amounts of assembly-competent ribosomal proteins. A detailed knowledge of eukaryotic ribosome assembly is instrumental to eventually understand and treat ribosomopathies, diseases frequently caused by altered functionalities of ribosomal proteins.
