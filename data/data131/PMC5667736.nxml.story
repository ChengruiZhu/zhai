Correctly perceiving behaviorally significant sounds—speech, music, and the acoustic environment—requires integrating acoustic information over time to extract relevant regularities. A fundamental question about this process is: How does the auditory brain integrate information of continuously varying sounds, typical of many natural auditory signals? How does the brain “sample” the input? To investigate this question, we measured how cortical activity is entrained by sound using the noninvasive technique magnetoencephalography. We presented sounds with temporal structure at different timescales and examined how the brain encodes such signals. We found, unexpectedly, that the human auditory system does not treat all rates equally but predominantly uses 2 nonoverlapping timescales, the slower (theta) and faster (gamma) bands, to track acoustic dynamics, while the timescale corresponding to an intermediate (alpha) timescale is likely reserved for other cortical operations, perhaps relating to attention and functional inhibition. The data support the hypothesis that the human auditory system employs (at least) a 2-timescale processing mode and that the perception of natural sounds, which feels seamless and continuous, is underpinned by segregated and discontinuous neural processing.
