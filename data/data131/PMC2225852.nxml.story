 Pauling and Miller have independently proposed that the presence of an anesthetic gas in tissue induces a cage-like arrangement of hydrogen-bonded water molecules. The theories recognize that most gas-hydrate crystals would not form at the temperature and pressure that exist during anesthesia and propose that other components of tissue such as protein should have a stabilizing effect. Measurements of the behavior of water, rather than the anesthetic agent, would provide alternative information about the likelihood of hydrate crystal formation and this information could be such as to be applicable to body temperature and to pressures used for anesthesia. If the number of hydrogen-bonded water molecules in tissue is increased, then the movement of an average water molecule should be hindered. Movement of water through the tissue may be measured by tagging it with tritium and the anesthetic gas should then slow the movement of tritiated water through the tissue. The flux of tritiated water through rat cecum is indeed slowed when the cecum is exposed to the anesthetic gas, xenon, which can participate biochemically only by virtue of its van der Waals interaction. The decrement in water flux is in reasonable agreement with what could be expected theoretically from calculations based on the activation energy for the self-diffusion of water and the degree of hypothermia necessary to produce narcosis.
