Rhythmic actions like chewing, scratching and walking need to be switched on and off. Once started, rhythms are generated by networks of neurons in the brain and spinal cord which drive muscles. We use computer models of the swimming network in young frog tadpoles to ask how electrically-coupled brainstem neurons with feedback excitation generate rhythmic activity and how this can be switched on and off by sensory stimuli. Young tadpoles swim for several seconds when touched and stop when they contact a solid object. Swimming rhythms can be generated by minimal populations of ~30 reticulospinal neurons on each side of the brainstem. The sensory pathways providing excitatory start and inhibitory stop signals are known. In our model network, based closely on biological evidence, brief synaptic excitation can activate a stable swimming rhythm sustained by mutual excitation among the reticulospinal neurons; swimming can be stopped by brief inhibition. Model networks of more generic neurons with mutual excitation can produce switchable, sustained non-rhythmic firing. We conclude that mutual excitation, providing positive feedback, can enable stable rhythmic or non-rhythmic firing in small neuron populations that can be rapidly turned on and off by sensory inputs.
