Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), comprising 85% of lung cancer cases, has been associated with resistance to chemo/radiotherapy. The hypoxic tumor micro-environment, where insufficient vasculature results in poor drug penetrance and sub-optimal chemotherapy in the tumor interiors contributes heavily to this resistance. Additionally, epigenetic changes in tumorigenic cells also change their response to different forms of therapy. In our study, we have investigated the effectiveness of a combination of cisplatin with scriptaid [a pan-Histone Deacetylase inhibitor (HDACi)] in a model that mimics the tumor microenvironment of hypoxia and sub-lethal chemotherapy. Scriptaid synergistically increases the efficacy of cisplatin in normoxia as well as hypoxia, accompanied with reduced metastasis and enhanced DNA damage. Addition of scriptaid also overcomes the cisplatin resistance exhibited in lung cancer cells with stabilized hypoxia inducible factor 1 (HIF1)-Î± (mutant) and mutant p53. Molecular studies showed that the combination treatment increased apoptotic cell death in both normoxia and hypoxia with a dual role of p38MAPK. Together, our results suggest that the combination of low dose cisplatin and scriptaid is cytotoxic to NSCLC lines, can overcome hypoxia induced resistance and mutant p53- induced instability often associated with this cancer, and has the potential to be an effective therapeutic modality.
