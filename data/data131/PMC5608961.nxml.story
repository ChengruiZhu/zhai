Problems associated with the proximal metacarpal region, such as an osseous injury associated with tearing of Sharpey’s fibers or an avulsion fracture of the origin of the suspensory ligament (OISL), are important causes of
lameness in racehorses. In the present study, four Thoroughbred racehorses (age range, 2–4 years) were diagnosed as having forelimb OISL and assessed over time by using standing magnetic resonance imaging (sMRI). At the first sMRI
examination, all horses had 3 characteristic findings, including low signal intensity within the trabecular bone of the third metacarpus on T1-weighted images, intermediate-to-high signal intensity surrounded by a hypointense rim
on T2*-weighted images, and high signal intensity on fat-suppressed images. Following the sMRI examination, all horses received 50 mg of tiludronic acid by intravenous regional limb perfusion once weekly for 3 weeks. Attenuation
of the high signal intensity on T2*-weighted and fat-suppressed images was observed on follow-up sMRI in 3 horses. Following rest and rehabilitation, these 3 horses successfully returned to racing. In contrast, the other horse
that did not show attenuation of the high signal intensity failed to return to racing. To our knowledge, this is the first report of OISL in Thoroughbred racehorses assessed over time by sMRI under tiludronic acid treatment. Our
findings support the use of sMRI for examining lameness originating from the proximal metacarpal region to refine the timing of returning to exercise based on follow-up examinations during the recuperation period.
