Bioactive composite macroporous scaffold containing nanoporosity was prepared by incorporation of nanoporous magnesium silicate (NMS) into poly(butylene succinate) (PBSu) using solvent castingâ€“particulate leaching method. The results showed that the water absorption and in vitro degradability of NMS/PBSu composite (NMPC) scaffold significantly improved compared with magnesium silicate (MS)/PBSu composite (MPC) scaffold. In addition, the NMPC scaffold showed improved apatite mineralization ability, indicating better bioactivity, as the NMPC containing nanoporosity could induce more apatite and homogeneous apatite layer on the surfaces than MPC scaffold. The attachment and proliferation of MC3T3-E1 cells on NMPC scaffold increased significantly compared with MPC scaffold, and the alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity of the cells on NMPC scaffold was expressed at considerably higher levels compared with MPC scaffold. Moreover, NMPC scaffold with nanoporosity not only had large drug loading (vancomycin) but also exhibited drug sustained release. The results suggested that the incorporation of NMS into PBSu could produce bioactive composite scaffold with nanoporosity, which could enhance water absorption, degradability, apatite mineralization and drug sustained release and promote cell responses.
