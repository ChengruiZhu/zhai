 G protein-mediated signaling, respectively. Furthermore, extended bioluminescence resonance energy transfer kinetic data monitoring OxA-dependent receptor-β-arrestin and β-arrestin-ubiquitin proximity suggested subtype-specific differences in receptor trafficking, with OxR2 activation resulting in more sustained receptor-β-arrestin-ubiquitin complex formation than elicited by OxR1 activation. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) data also revealed that OxR1 underwent significantly more rapid recycling compared with OxR2. Finally, we have observed sustained OxA-dependent ERK1/2 phosphorylation in the presence of OxR2 compared with OxR1. Although both OxR subtypes could be classified as class B receptors for β-arrestin usage based on the initial strength of interaction with both β-arrestins, our temporal profiling revealed tangible differences between OxR subtypes. Consequently, OxR1 appears to fit uneasily into the commonly used β-arrestin classification scheme. More importantly, it is hoped that this improved profiling capability, enabling the subtleties of protein complex formation, stability, and duration to be assessed in live cells, will help unlock the therapeutic potential of targeting these receptors.
