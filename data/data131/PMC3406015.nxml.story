The best-understood portion of mammalian genomes contains genes transcribed into RNAs, which are subsequently translated into proteins. These genes are generally under high selective pressure and deeply conserved between species. Recent publications have revealed novel classes of genes, which are also transcribed into RNA but are not subsequently translated into proteins. One such novel class are long noncoding RNA (lncRNA). LncRNA loci are controlled in a similar manner to protein-coding genes, yet are more often expressed tissue-specifically, and their conservation and function(s) are mostly unknown. Previous reports suggest that lncRNAs can affect the expression of nearby protein-coding genes or act at a distance to control broader biological processes. Also, lncRNA sequence is poorly conserved between mammals compared with protein-coding genes, but how rapidly their transcription evolves, particularly between closely related species, remains unknown. By comparing lncRNA expression between homologous tissues in two species of mouse and in rat, we discovered that lncRNA genes are “born” or “die” more rapidly than protein-coding genes and that this rapid evolution impacts the expression levels of nearby coding genes. This local regulation of gene expression reveals a functional role for the rapid evolution of lncRNAs, which may contribute to biological differences between species.
