The mechanical pressure difference across the bacterial cellulose membrane located in a horizontal plane causes asymmetry of voltage measured between electrodes immersed in KCl solutions symmetrically on both sides of the membrane. For all measurements, KCl solution with lower concentration was above the membrane. In configuration of the analyzed membrane system, the concentration boundary layers (CBLs) are created only by molecular diffusion. The voltages measured in the membrane system in concentration polarization conditions were compared with suitable voltages obtained from the model of diffusion through CBLs and ion transport through the membrane. An increase of difference of mechanical pressure across the membrane directed as a difference of osmotic pressure always causes a decrease of voltage between the electrodes in the membrane system. In turn, for mechanical pressure difference across the membrane directed in an opposite direction to the difference of osmotic pressure, a peak in the voltage as a function of mechanical pressure difference is observed. An increase of osmotic pressure difference across the membrane at the initial moment causes an increase of the maximal value of the observed peak and a shift of this peak position in the direction of higher values of the mechanical pressure differences across the membrane.
