Salt sensitivity of blood pressure (BP) is an independent risk factor for cardiovascular morbidity. Up to 50% of patients with essential hypertension are salt-sensitive, as manifested by a rise in BP with salt intake. Several genetic variations have been identified as being associated with salt sensitivity. The present study aimed to review the evidence on the effect of gene polymorphisms on the salt sensitivity of BP. We searched in PubMed website from 1990 to 2011, with the use of following keywords: “hypertension, dietary salt, polymorphisms, and blood pressure”. The effect of sodium intake on BP differed by genotype at the genes of the renin-angiotensin system, aldosterone synthase, cytochrome p450 3A, epithelial sodium channel genes, genes of sympathetic nervous system, β-3 subunit of G-protein, alpha-adducin, endothelial nitric oxide synthase, Kallikrein-Kinin system. These approaches suggest that these polymorphisms may be potentially useful genetic markers of BP response to dietary salt. There is evidence that genetic predisposition modulates the BP response to diet. Therefore, diet and nutrition can mitigate or enhance the effects of genetic predisposition. Increasing our knowledge of this relationship can lead to individualized treatment and increased understanding of hypertension.
