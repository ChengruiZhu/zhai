Tocilizumab (TCZ) and tumour necrosis factor inhibitors (TNFi) are recommended for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) in patients with inadequate response (IR) to prior disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs). This retrospective analysis assessed the efficacy of TCZ and TNFi, alone or in combination with DMARDs, in 1603 patients with IR to previous treatment with either DMARDs (DMARD-IR) and/or TNFi (TNFi-IR), initiating treatment with TCZ or a TNFi, managed in routine clinical practice. Patients were grouped according to treatment history and treatment initiated: DMARD-IR patients initiating treatment with TCZ + DMARD (DMARD-IR TCZ) or TNFi + DMARD (DMARD-IR TNFi), DMARD-IR and/or TNFi-IR patients initiating treatment with TCZ monotherapy (TCZ mono) or TNFi monotherapy (TNFi mono), and TNFi-IR patients initiating treatment with TCZ + DMARD (TNFi-IR TCZ) or TNFi + DMARD (TNFi-IR TNFi). Patients initiating treatment with TCZ generally had more severe disease and longer disease duration compared with the corresponding TNFi group. Significantly more patients achieved remission (DAS28 ESR <2.6) in the TCZ groups compared with corresponding TNFi groups (DMARD-IR, TCZ 44.0 % vs. TNFi 29.6 %; monotherapy, TCZ 37.2 % vs. TNFi 30.2 %; TNF-IR, TCZ 41.3 % vs. TNFi 19.2 %;
