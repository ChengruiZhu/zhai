Tumors recognized by the host immune system are associated with better survival. However, the immune system is often suppressed in patients with established tumor burden. Stimulating the immune system to detect and kill tumor cells has been a challenge in cancer therapy for some time. Recently, novel cancer immunotherapies, such as immune checkpoint inhibitors, monoclonal antibodies, and vaccine therapies, have emerged as promising therapeutic approaches for many solid tumors. However, for some tumors, immunotherapy alone has not provided significant benefits, and some may even be fully resistant to immunotherapy. It has been suggested that the immune system may require “priming” before an immunotherapy can elicit an immune response. Although chemotherapies are believed to be immunosuppressive, when given at the right dose and sequence these agents may provide this “priming” effect for the immune system. In addition to direct cytotoxic killing of tumor cells, standard chemotherapeutic agents can elicit immunogenicity through various mechanisms. This review highlights the general immunomodulatory properties of chemotherapy agents. It also provides a rationale for combined therapy with
