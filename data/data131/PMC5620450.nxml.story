PA-MSHA and BPIFB1 play especially important roles in triggering innate immune responses by inducing production of pro- or anti-inflammatory cytokines in the oral cavity and upper airway. We found that PA-MSHA had a strong ability to activate pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-1β, IL-6 and TNF-α. However, BPIFB1 alone did not express a directly inductive effect. With incubation of PA-MSHA and BPIFB1, the combination can activate the CD14/TLR4/MyD88 complex and induce secretion of subsequent downstream cytokines. We used a proteome profiler antibody array to evaluate the phosphokinases status with PA-MSHA and BPIFB1 treatment. The results showed that the activation of MAPK, STAT, and PI-3K pathways is involved in PA-MSHA-BPIFB1 treatment, and that the related pathways control the secretion of targeting cytokines in the downstream. When we assessed the content changes of cytokines, we found that PA-MSHA-BPIFB1 treatment increased the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines in the early phase of treatment and induced the increase of IL-4 in the late phase. Our observations suggest that PA-MSHA-BPIFB1 stimulates the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines, and thereby initiates the innate immune system against inflammation. Meanwhile, the gradual release of anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-4 by PA-MSHA-BPIFB1 can also regulate the degree of inflammatory response; thus the host can effectively resist the environmental risks, but also manipulate inflammatory response in an appropriate and adjustable manner.
