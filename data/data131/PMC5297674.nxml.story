Non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) are a new type of regulators that play important roles in various cellular processes, including cell growth, differentiation, survival, and apoptosis. ncRNAs, including small non-coding RNAs (e.g., microRNAs, small interfering RNAs) and long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs), are pervasively transcribed in human and mammalian cells. Recently, it has been recognized that these ncRNAs are critically implicated in the virus–host interaction as key regulators of transcription or post-transcription during viral infection. Influenza A virus (IAV) is still a major threat to human health. Hundreds of ncRNAs are differentially expressed in response to infection with IAV, such as infection by pandemic H1N1 and highly pathogenic avian strains. There is increasing evidence demonstrating functional involvement of these regulatory microRNAs, vault RNAs (vtRNAs) and lncRNAs in pathogenesis of influenza virus, including a variety of host immune responses. For example, it has been shown that ncRNAs regulate activation of pattern recognition receptor (PRR)-associated signaling and transcription factors (nuclear factor κ-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells, NF-κB), as well as production of interferons (IFNs) and cytokines, and expression of critical IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs). The vital functions of IAV-regulated ncRNAs either to against defend viral invasion or to promote progeny viron production are summarized in this review. In addition, we also highlight the potentials of ncRNAs as therapeutic targets and diagnostic biomarkers.
