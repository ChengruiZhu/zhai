Primary neuroendocrine tumors of the thymus are rare mediastinum tumors, which present a distinct type of tumor, which exhibit morpholgical and biological neuroendorcine features including the production of numerous biogenic amines. The aim of the present study was to evaluate factors influencing long-term survival in patients with primary neuroendocrine tumors of the thymus. A total of 22 patients exhibiting primary thymic neuroendocrine tumors, who were treated at the Zhejiang Cancer Hospital (Hangzhou, China), between 1995 and 2012 were reviewed. Survival curves were plotted using the Kaplan-Meier method and the Cox proportional hazards model was used for multivariate analysis. The overall five-year survival rate was 45.5% and the median survival time was 59 months in all of the patients. Histological grade (P<0.001), Masaoka-Koga stage (P=0.003) and surgical resection status (P=0.004) were identified to be associated with patient survival time. Furthermore, multivariate analysis identified that the histological grade was an independent prognostic factor, which was applicable to all patients (P=0.009). Therefore, the histological grade and Masaoka-Koga stage, as well as surgical resection status present three prognostic factors in patients exhibiting primary thymic neuroendocrine tumors.
