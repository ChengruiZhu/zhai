Eukaryotic DNA replication begins at specific sites in the genome called replication origins, which are bound by the proteins that comprise the origin recognition complex (ORC). In budding yeast, there are more replication origins available than are used in any particular cell division cycle. Each origin has a characteristic time during the cell division cycle when the DNA replication machinery is assembled at a particular origin and begins to replicate DNA. Previous studies have indicated that differences in replication timing and origin use/availability may be a consequence of the chromatin structure surrounding an origin. Here we present a genome-wide analysis of nucleosome architecture of replication origins aligned by their ORC-binding site. We find that origins can be built with a variety of nucleosome occupancy patterns, and that these patterns are influenced by adjacent genomic features. Finally, we determined the genome-wide consequences of ORC depletion on nucleosome architecture at origins. ORC depletion allowed encroachment of flanking nucleosomes towards the origin and changed the nucleosome phasing, indicating that ORC acts as a barrier to position and phase nucleosomes. Our analysis provides a comprehensive, genome-wide view of replication origins that reveals a previously unappreciated diversity in origin structure.
