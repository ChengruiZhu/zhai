Interstitial pneumonia develops in association with inhaled particles. In-air microparticle induced X-ray emission (in-air micro) analysis was previously employed to assess the spatial distribution and content of particles in surgical lung biopsy specimens. The aim of this study was to assess the efficacy of in-air micro-analysis for transbronchial lung biopsy specimens in patients with or without occupational exposure. The elements composing lung particles and their locations could be identified by in-air micro-analysis. Silicon was the major component of particles. Quantitative analysis revealed that the elements composing lung particles varied between patients. In a patient with suspected nickel exposure, aluminium, vanadium, and calcium were detected, but was not detected. In a patient without a work history (housewife), various elements were detected. In-air micro-analysis was useful for assessing the spatial distribution and content of particles in specimens from patients. Occupational exposure was not necessarily associated with deposition of particles in the lungs. Therefore, in the diagnosis of, elemental analysis of specimens by in-air micro-analysis could be useful for assessing exposure to particles objectively.
