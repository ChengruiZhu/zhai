 Plasma LDH levels were determined in normal and Riley virus-infected mice following treatment with various drugs known to alter the activity of the RES. The rise in plasma LDH level after Riley virus infection was considerably enhanced by previous treatment with thorotrast (to produce blockade of the RES), and decreased by previous treatment with stilboestrol (to stimulate the RES). A dose of 2000 r whole-body x-irradiation, lethal within 3 to 4 days, did not alter the phagocytic activity of the RES, and was without effect on plasma LDH activity in normal mice, or on the rise in plasma LDH level following infection with Riley virus. Blockade of the RES with cholesterol oleate, thorotrast, or zymosan, resulted in a 2- to 3-fold rise in plasma LDH level within a few hours. The level returned to normal by 1 to 3 days. Stimulation of the RES with stilboestrol resulted in a decrease in plasma LDH level by 1 to 2 days in both normal and infected mice, with a return to normal by about a week. Blockade of the RES in uninfected mice with thorotrast or cholesterol oleate, besides increasing the plasma LDH level caused a rise in plasma phosphoglucose isomerase level, but no significant alterations in plasma aldolase or alanine transaminase levels, studied up to 10 days. Riley virus causes a similar pattern of enzyme elevation. It is suggested that the increased levels of certain plasma enzymes in Riley virus-infected mice may be due to competitive inhibition by virus particles of plasma enzyme clearance by the RES.
