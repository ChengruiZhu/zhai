 = 64 triplets of RNA sequences (codons) into 20 canonical amino acids and the stop signal. This code book is universal in almost all organisms on earth. Selenoproteins consist of selenium-containing amino acids–selenocysteines (Sec)–that are not among the 20 canonical amino acids. The cells “borrow” a stop codon UGA to translate selenocysteines. Since UGA maps to two possible outcomes, the translation machinery can synthesize both full-length selenoproteins (when UGA encodes selenocysteine) and truncated peptide chains (when UGA encodes translational termination). Despite extensive study about selenoprotein synthesis mechanisms, a quantitative model for how cells allocate resources to synthesize each species is yet to appear. We propose a quantitative model that can explain the dependency of experimental observables such as protein stability and Sec incorporation efficiency by various factors such as selenium concentration and mRNA levels. Saturation of those quantities implies the existence of limiting factors such as mRNA transcripts and Sec-specific tRNAs. The match between model simulations and experimental data suggests that the cellular decision making of synthesizing the two species of proteins may follow simple first-order kinetics.
