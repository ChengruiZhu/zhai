Accurate genome duplication is crucial at each cell generation to maintain genetic information. However, replication forks routinely face lesions on the DNA template and/or travel through sequences intrinsically difficult to replicate, such as common fragile sites (CFS). To help the fork to proceed, the cells have evolved the DNA damage checkpoint that senses different types of damage and triggers well-adapted cellular responses. We have studied the DNA damage response of human lymphoblastoid cells and normal fibroblasts to various levels of fork slowing. We showed that a two- to ten-fold reduction of fork speed leads to global chromatin recruitment of sensors and mediators of the ATR pathway without substantial activation of Chk1, ATM or p53. Analysis of the phenotype of cells depleted of ATR or Chk1 and submitted to moderate levels of stress shows that ATR, but not Chk1, is crucial to CFS integrity. We propose a model explaining how fork speed thresholds direct fine-tuned checkpoint responses that protect genome integrity without blocking cell cycle progression upon moderate replication fork impediment. Tolerance to mitotic entry with under-replicated CFSs therefore results in chromosome breaks, providing a pool of cells committed to further instability.
