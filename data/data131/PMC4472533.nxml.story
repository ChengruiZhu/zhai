There is considerable interest in the potential of botanicals in preventing and/or alleviating chronic ailments. Among the most studied botanicals are compounds present in green and black teas. Nontoxic tea polyphenols are potent antioxidants, and they also modulate several signalling pathways and inhibit proteins such as MMP-9 or protein plasminogen activator system, making them very attractive potential therapeutics. One criticism of the prophylactic or therapeutic use of green or black tea polyphenols was presumably the poor bioavailability of these chemicals when ingested. However, studies have shown that epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG) and theaflavin (TF) can be detected in the small and large intestine, liver, and prostate of experimental animals after consumption of tea extracts. In particular, a study was carried out on 20 men scheduled for prostatectomy, who were assigned to consume teas for five days before surgery. Tea polyphenols were detected in the prostate. This fact contradicts the common misconception of poor bioavailability of TF and EGCG and makes feasible the application of green or black tea polyphenols as prophylactic and therapeutic agents. Theaflavins and catechins seem to act on cancer cells largely through different pathways, so utilisation of both could offer synergistic anticancer effects, but so far no work has been done on the cumulative effects of EGCG and TF on prostate cancer. Therefore, in this study we have investigated if EGCG in combination with TF can reduce the rate of prostate cancer growth, and we have observed greater cell death compared to application of either TF or EGCG alone.
