Many proteins interact with other proteins as part of their function. One method of modulating the activity of protein complexes is to break them apart. Some complexes, however, are extremely kinetically stable and it is unclear how these can dissociate on a biologically relevant timescale. In this study we address this question using protein complexes between colicin E9 (a bacterial toxin) and its immunity protein Im9. These highly avid complexes (with a lifetime of days) must be broken apart for colicin to be activated. By using single-molecule force methods we show that pulling on one end of colicin E9 drastically destabilises the complex so that it dissociates a million-fold faster than its intrinsic rate. We then show that preventing this destabilisation (by the insertion of cross-links that pin the N-terminus of E9 in place) yields a kinetically stable complex. It has previously been postulated that force can destabilise a protein complex by partially unfolding one or more binding partners. Our work provides new experimental evidence that shows this is the case and provides a mechanism for this phenomenon, which we term a trip bond. For the E9:Im9 complex, trip bond behaviour allows a stable complex to be rapidly dissociated by application of a surprisingly small force.
