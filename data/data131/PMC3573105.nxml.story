DNA and RNA are made up from basic building blocks called nucleotides. Those nucleotides also play essential roles in many other biological processes. To separate biological processes within a cell is an important feature of all cell types. For example, mitochondria are specialized structures that contain ATP synthase, the enzyme that makes the nucleotide ATP. While mitochondria and ATP synthase have been studied for about 100 years, it was only very recently that we realized that there are specialized subcellular structures that contain CTP synthase, the enzyme that makes up another basic nucleotide CTP. Several independent studies have shown that CTP synthase molecules can form a filamentous structure called the cytoophidium (meaning “cellular snake” in Greek) or CTP synthase filament in bacteria, budding yeasts, fruit flies, and rat and human cells. In budding yeast, there are two isoforms of CTP synthase and both isoforms localize in the cytoophidium. Here, we report that three CTP synthase isoforms in fruit flies show a distinct subcellular distribution and only one isoform forms the cytoophidium. Thus, the study of multiple isoforms of CTP synthase in the fruit fly gives us a good way to begin to learn how and why CTP synthase molecules form this snake-like structure.
