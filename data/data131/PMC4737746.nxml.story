Photodynamic therapy (PDT) of cancer is an efficient and promising therapeutic modality approved for the treatment of several types of tumors and non-malignant diseases. It involves administration of a non-toxic photosensitizer followed by illumination of the tumor site with a harmless visible light. A light activated photosensitizer can transfer its energy directly to molecular oxygen, leading to production of highly toxic reactive oxygen species (ROS). Antitumor effects of PDT result from the combination of three independent mechanisms involving direct cytotoxicity to tumor cells, destruction of tumor vasculature and induction of the acute local inflammatory response. PDT-mediated inflammatory reaction is accompanied by tumor infiltration of the leukocytes, enhanced production of pro-inflammatory factors and cytokines. Photodynamic therapy is able to effectively stimulate both the innate and the adaptive arm of the immune system. In consequence, this regimen can lead to development of systemic and specific antitumor immune response. However, there are limited studies suggesting that under some specific circumstances, PDT on its own may exert some immunosuppressive effects leading to activation of immunosuppressive cells or cytokines production. In this report we briefly review all immunological aspects of PDT treatment.
