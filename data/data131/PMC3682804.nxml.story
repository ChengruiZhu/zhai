This work reports on the investigation of the photosensitive polymer poly(diphenyl bicyclo[2.2.1]hept-5-ene-2,3-dicarboxylate) (PPNB), which undergoes the photo-Fries rearrangement upon illumination with UV-light, used as interfacial layers in organic electronic devices. Two cases were investigated: the use of a blend of PPNB with poly-vinylcarbazole (PVK) as an interlayer in para-sexiphenyl (PSP) based organic light emitting diodes (OLEDs) and the use of PPNB as gate dielectric layer in organic field effect transistors (OFETs). The photo-Fries rearrangement reaction causes a change of the polymer chemical structure resulting in a change of its physical and chemical properties. The electroluminescence spectra and emission of the PSP OLEDs are not affected when fabricated with a non-UV-illuminated PPNB:PVK blend. However, the electroluminescence is totally quenched in those OLEDs fabricated with UV-illuminated PPNB:PVK blend. Although the dielectric constant of PPNB increases upon UV-treatment, it is demonstrated that those OFETs built with UV-treated PPNB as gate dielectric have lower performance than those OFETs built with non-UV-treated PPNB. Furthermore, the effect of the UV-illumination of PPNB and PPNB:PVK blend on the growth of the small molecules C
