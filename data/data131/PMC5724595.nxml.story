This paper presents an anthropomorphic phantom study of dose delivered to a specific point during tangential breast irradiation to verify monitor unit calculations. Measurements were made using a 0.6 cc Farmer type cylindrical ionization chamber in the phantom and compared to calculations made on a three‚Äêdimensional radiotherapy treatment planning system using single digitized contour through to multi slice CT data. A large breast phantom was used for a single field size with a combination of open and wedged fields for three different energies (4, 6, and 18 MV). Solid flat phantom measurements were also performed for comparison. Results showed a lower calculated dose than the dose measured for a fixed number of monitor units where the variations were within a range of 0.8% to 4.5%. Differences were larger for the anthropomorphic phantom than the flat phantom. We conclude that little accuracy is gained from CT based monitor unit calculations compared to those based on digitised contours for this breast treatment but that the dose distributions will be affected. This type of test is recommended as one of a large set, in the commissioning and testing procedures for treatment planning systems.
