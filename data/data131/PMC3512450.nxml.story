The model estimated that the median time until exhaustion of currently available treatment options is 43.4 years (interquartile range = 31.4 to 58.6 years). However, the model predicts that 10% of PLHIV will use up all currently available cART options after just 22.6 years. The figure shows the survival proportions of males from age 20 years in four mortality scenarios: (1) the general population mortality rate; (2) the mortality rate in PLHIV as currently measured (without considering exhaustion of currently available treatments); (3) mortality rate in PLHIV considering additional mortality due to limited cART options; and (4) mortality rate if no cART is available. PLHIV who start currently available cART regimens at age 20 years are expected to live to a median of 64.7 (95% uncertainty bound (UB) = 61.8 to 69.3) years of age, when adjusting for treatment option exhaustion. This is a substantial improvement on no cART (median survival to 27.6 [95% UB = 27.2 to 28.1] years of age) but is lower than the expected life expectancy (82.2 years of age) of an HIV-negative male in the general population. The gap between life expectancy among PLHIV and the general population is greater for those infected at younger ages.
