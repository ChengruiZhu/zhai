The elevated lysophosphatidic acid signaling has been causally linked to cancer-associated inflammation and tumorigenesis through upregulation of nuclear factor-κB signaling. However, how this signaling event is regulated has not yet been fully understood. Here we demonstrate that TRIP6, an LPA2 receptor-interacting adaptor protein, functions as a positive regulator of nuclear factor-κB and JNK signaling through direct binding to and activation of the E3 ligase TRAF6. Upon lysophosphatidic acid stimulation, TRIP6 recruits TRAF6 to the LPA2 receptor and promotes lysophosphatidic acid-induced JNK and nuclear factor-κB activation in a TRAF6-dependent manner. TRIP6 antagonizes the recruitment of deubiquitinases A20 and CYLD to TRAF6, thus sustaining the E3 ligase activity of TRAF6 and augmenting lysophosphatidic acid-activated nuclear factor-κB signaling. In contrast, depletion of TRIP6 by TRIP6-specific shRNA or Cas9/sgRNA greatly enhances the association of TRAF6 with A20 and CYLD, and attenuates lysophosphatidic acid-induced muclear factor-κB and JNK/p38 activation in ovarian cancer cells. On the other hand, TRAF6 also regulates TRIP6 by facilitating its binding to nuclear factor-κB p65 and phosphorylation by c-Src. Together, TRIP6 cooperates with TRAF6 to regulate the LPA2 receptor signaling, which may ultimately contribute to chronic inflammation, apoptotic resistance and cell invasion.
