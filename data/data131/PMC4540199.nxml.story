>500â€‰nM) and high expression of the UDP glucuronosyltransferase 1A (UGT1A) gene cluster. Moreover, CRC tumor samples showed a comparable distribution of UGT1A expression levels. The members of the UGT1A gene family are known as drug-conjugating liver enzymes involved in drug excretion, but their function in tumor cells is hardly understood. Chemically unrelated HSP90 inhibitors, for example, 17-N-allylamino-17-demethoxygeldanamycin (17-AAG), did not show correlation of drug sensitivities with UGT1A levels, whereas the ganetespib-related compound NVP-AUY922 did. When the most ganetespib-resistant cell line, HT29, was treated with ganetespib, the levels of HSP90 clients were unaffected. However, HT29 cells became sensitized to the drug, and HSP90 client proteins were destabilized by ganetespib upon siRNA-mediated UGT1A knockdown. Conversely, the most ganetespib-sensitive cell lines HCT116 and SW480 became more tolerant toward ganetespib upon UGT1A overexpression. Mechanistically, ganetespib was rapidly glucuronidated and excreted in resistant but not in sensitive CRC lines. We conclude that CRC cell-expressed UGT1A inactivates ganetespib and other resorcinolic Hsp90 inhibitors by glucuronidation, which renders the drugs unable to inhibit Hsp90 and thereby abrogates their biological activity. UGT1A levels in tumor tissues may be a suitable predictive biomarker to stratify CRC patients for ganetespib treatment.
