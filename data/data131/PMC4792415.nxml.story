The validity of these findings depends on the assumptions included in the mathematical model and on the accuracy of the data fed into the model. However, routine pediatric EV71 vaccination remained cost-effective at broadly similar EVCs in sensitivity analyses in which the assumptions built into the model were altered. Overall, these findings suggest that routine pediatric EV71 vaccination would be very cost-effective in China provided the cost of immunization (including the cost of the vaccine and all the logistical and administration costs of vaccination) is below between US$12.0 and US$18.3 per vaccination; because the different vaccines have different efficacies, the exact value depends on which vaccine is used for vaccination. Thus, with 16 million births each year, the annual costs for routine pediatric EV71 vaccination in China should not exceed US$192â€“US$293 million. Importantly, when combined with the findings of a previous study in which the same researchers showed large geographical variations in the risk of EV71-associated HFMD across China, these findings can help policymakers identify those regions in China where EV71 vaccination is likely to be most cost-effective.
