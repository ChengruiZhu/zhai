The nervous system has the ability to rapidly and flexibly coordinate many muscles and limbs to produce movements. This neuromechanical transformation must robustly achieve motor goals under the changing mechanics of the body and environment, and select one solution amongst many alternatives. What computational principles govern such decisions? Although optimality principles have predicted features of biological movement in simple models, here we show that this computational principle can robustly predict detailed experimental measures in an unrestrained, whole-body balance task. Detailed patterns of muscle activity and forces across multiple movement directions and body configurations were predicted based on interactions between musculoskeletal mechanics of the limbs, and task-level neural strategy of controlling the CoM mechanics while minimizing control effort. Moreover, similar muscle activity and forces were generated when muscles were coupled together in groups called muscle synergies, reducing the number of independent variables that are controlled. Our work is consistent with the idea that the nervous system may learn to coordinate muscles and limbs by minimizing effort in producing natural movements, and may use approximate solutions based on muscle synergies. Understanding such neural mechanisms may allow us to predict the effects of neural injury and disease on motor function.
