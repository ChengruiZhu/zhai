The present study was designed in order to explore the association between the early metastasis of renal cell carcinoma (RCC) and biological markers of tumor cells. A total of 200 patients with RCC, who received a nephrectomy between January 2015 and October 2015, were enrolled in the present study, while 100 healthy patients served as controls. The expression of cytokeratin 19 (CK19), endoglin (CD105) and cluster of differentiation 146 (CD146) were detected using immunohistochemical staining and western blotting. All three markers were highly expressed in tumor tissues compared with adjacent normal tissues. Subsequently, an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay was used to detect the differential expression of CK19, CD105 and CD146. The results revealed that there was a statistically significant difference in the expression of CK19 and CD105 between the two groups (P<0.05), whereas CD146 did not exhibit a statistically significant difference. The results of further experiments revealed no significant difference between four time points (Q1, 1 day pre-operation; Q2, 1 day post-operation; Q3, 1 week post-operation; and Q4, 1 month post-operation). Then, subgroup analysis was performed based on whether patients were circulating tumor cell (CTC)-positive or not, and the difference between the Q1 time point and other three time points (Q2-4). The results revealed no difference between the CTC-positive and -negative groups, and no difference between the time points Q1 and Q2. However, the expression of CK19 and CD105 exhibited a significant difference between CTC-positive and CTC-negative groups according to the difference between the time points Q1 and Q3. Furthermore, on the basis of the difference between Q1 and Q4, the expression of CK19, CD105 and CD146 were significantly different (P<0.05). Taken together, the results suggested that CK19, CD105 and CD146 markers of peripheral blood may be considered to be effective tools to evaluate the early metastasis in a CTC-positive condition. CK19, CD105 and CD146 may be useful for CTC in evaluating the prognosis of patients with RCC, although a larger sample size is necessary for further investigation.
