For every course of radiotherapy treatment, the potential benefit has to be weighed against the risk of normal tissue damage. Radiation-induced proctitis during and after radical radiotherapy for prostate cancer can be decreased by reducing both the size of the target volume and the margins required around this volume. In the future, target volumes could be reduced by both CT/MRI co-registration and dose painting using MR spectroscopy of choline and citrate in the prostate. Improved immobilisation and image-guided radiotherapy should allow reduced margins without compromising the effectiveness of treatment. Similarly, in breast radiotherapy treatment, lung and cardiac complications can be reduced by better patient positioning and ensuring that doses to the heart and lung are minimised during radiotherapy treatment planning. Cosmesis can be improved by using 3D breast planning techniques rather than the conventional 2D approach. These ongoing improvements and developments in radiotherapy treatment planning are leading to treatments which offer both better tumour volume coverage, and are minimising the risk of treatment-related complications. In time, these changes should allow the escalation in dose delivered to the tumour volume with the potential for increased cure rates.
