A 36-year-old tetraplegic patient, who was managed by intermittent catheterizations performed by caregivers, developed recurrent autonomic dysreflexia during a week due to: 1) carers not performing intermittent catheterizations every night; 2) infrequent catheterizations during the day, leading to distension of urinary bladder. A day before his demise, carer attempted routine catheterization; but was unable to insert the catheter; blood pressure rose to 192/109 mmHg. Nifedipine 10 mg was administered. Thirty minutes later, blood pressure was 181/113 mmHg; second dose of Nifedipine was not given. Forty minutes elapsed before a senior carer came and catheterized successfully. Meanwhile, patient developed pounding headache; became drowsy; was talking incoherently. Four and half hours after unsuccessful catheterization, carers contacted emergency services and the patient was taken to Accident and Emergency; CT of head revealed very large acute intracranial hemorrhage in the right frontal and parietal lobes. The patient expired a day later. The Coroner’s verdict: “Patient died of massive intracranial hemorrhage caused by autonomic dysreflexia, a known complication of high spinal cord injury. Emergency protocols to manage autonomic dysreflexia were not followed in the days leading up to his death.”
