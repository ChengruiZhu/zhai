We analyzed morphological and immunohistochemical features in 174 aggressive B-cell lymphomas of nodal and extranodal origin. Morphological features included presence or absence of a follicular component and cytologic criteria according to the Kiel classification, whereas immunohistochemical studies included expression of CD10, BCL-2, BCL-6, IRF4/MUM1, HLA-DR, p53, Ki-67 and the assessment of plasmacytoid differentiation. Patients were treated with a CHOP-like regimen. While the presence or absence of either CD10, BCL-6 and IRF4/MUM1 reactivity or plasmacytoid differentiation did not identify particular cytomorphologic or site-specific subtypes, we found that expression of CD10 and BCL-6, and a low reactivity for IRF4/MUM1 were favourable prognostic indicators. In contrast, BCL-2 expression and presence of a monotypic cytoplasmic immunoglobulin expression was associated with an unfavourable prognosis in univariate analyses. Meta-analysis of these data resulted in the development of a cumulative immunohistochemical outcome predictor score (CIOPS) enabling the recognition of four distinct prognostic groups. Multivariate analysis proved this score to be independent of the international prognostic index. Such a cumulative immunohistochemical scoring approach might provide a valuable alternative in the recognition of defined risk types of aggressive B-cell lymphomas.
