Retinal neurodegenerative diseases involve a scenario of inflammation and cell death that leads to morphological alterations and visual impairment. Non-ocular inflammatory processes could affect neurodegenerative retinal disorders and their progression, at least in part by activating microglial cells and releasing pro-inflammatory cytokines. Our purpose was to study the consequences of a systemic inflammatory process in the progression of retinal degeneration in P23H rats, a retinitis pigmentosa (RP) model. In order to induce a mild chronic systemic inflammation, we administered low doses of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) from age P20 to P60 to dystrophic P23H rats and healthy SD rats. Visual responsiveness was assessed by electroretinography (ERG). The morphological state of the retinas was analyzed by fluorescent immunohistochemistry (IHC), evaluating the number, morphology, and connectivity of different neuronal populations by means of cell type-specific markers. Microglia density, distribution, and degree of activation were evaluated by IHC and flow cytometry. The expression levels of inflammation- and apoptosis-related genes were analyzed by qRT-PCR arrays. Low-dose LPS administration did not induce significant functional or morphological changes in the retina of SD rats, although at the molecular level, we detected expression changes in genes related to apoptosis. Otherwise, systemic injection of LPS into P23H rats induced a further deterioration in the ERG response, with greater loss of photoreceptors and worsening of synaptic connectivity, accompanied by increasing numbers of microglial cells, which also showed a more intense activation state. Several inflammation- and apoptosis-related genes were upregulated. Our results indicate that chronic exacerbation of the inflammatory response in response to LPS accelerates neurodegeneration in dystrophic P23H rats, suggesting that in patients with ocular neurodegenerative diseases, peripheral damage, as a systemic infection or chronic inflammatory process, could accelerate disease progression, and should be taken into account in order to select an appropriate therapy to revert, block or slow-down the degenerative process.
