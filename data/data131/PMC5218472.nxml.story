Interleukin-6 (IL-6) is a cytokine secreted by our body upon infection or trauma to stimulate the immune system response. IL-6 is partially responsible for fever and triggers inflammation in many diseases. It activates its target cells via the membrane-bound IL-6 receptor (IL-6R), and soluble forms of this receptor (sIL-6R) are present in high amounts in the serum of healthy individuals and mediate the inflammatory response in all cells of the human body. However, it remains unclear how the soluble form of this cytokine is generated in humans. In this study, we isolate sIL-6R from human serum and show that the majority is produced via cleavage of the membrane-bound IL-6R by a protease. We identify the exact cleavage site and find that it is identical to a cleavage site used by the metalloprotease ADAM17. We further show that glycosylation, a post-transcriptional modification, is dispensable for the transport and biological function of IL-6R and map the occupancy of all O- and N-glycosylation sites. However, we find that only a single N-glycan is critically involved in the regulation of proteolysis by ADAM17 and conclude that glycosylation is an important regulator for sIL-6R generation.
