When electrical potentials are measured in the extracellular space (ECS) of the brain, they are interpreted as a signature of neural signalling. The relationship between the ECS potentials and the underlying neuronal processes is often studied with the aid of computer models. The ECS potential is typically assumed not to be affected by diffusive currents in the ECS, and existing models therefore neglect diffusion. However, there may be scenarios where this assumption does not hold. Here, we present a new computational model which explicitly models ion-concentration dynamics in the ECS surrounding a neural population, and which allows us to quantify the effect that diffusive currents have on the ECS potential. Using this model, we simulate a scenario where a population of pyramidal neurons is active over a long time, and produces large, but realistic concentration gradients in the ECS. In this scenario, diffusive currents are found to influence the ECS potential at frequency components as high as ten hertz. Unlike previously believed, we thus predict that there are scenarios where recorded local field potentials (LFPs) are likely to contain signatures not only of neural activity, but also of ECS diffusion.
