Migration is fundamental to immune cell function, and accurate quantitative methods are crucial for analyzing and interpreting migration statistics. However, existing methods of analysis cannot uniquely describe cell behavior and suffer from various limitations. This complicates efforts to address questions such as to what extent chemotactic signals direct cellular behaviors and how random migration of many cells leads to coordinated immune response. We therefore develop methods that provide a complete description of migration with a minimum of assumptions and describe specific quantities for characterizing directional motion. Using numerical simulations and experimental data, we evaluate these measures and discuss methods to minimize the effects of experimental artifacts. These methodologies may be applied to various migrating cells or organisms. We apply our approach to an important model system, T cells migrating in lymph node. Surprisingly, we find that the canonical Brownian-walker-like model does not accurately describe migration. Instead, we find that T cells move heterogeneously and are described by a two-population model of persistent and diffusive random walkers. This model is completely different from the generalized LÃ©vy walk model that describes activated T cells in brains infected with
