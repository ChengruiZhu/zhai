Heterotopic pancreas (HP) is typically an asymptomatic malformation that can present anywhere along the gastrointestinal tract. It is often detected incidentally on surgery for other diseases or autopsy. We encountered 2 patients with jejunal HP incidentally detected by computed tomography (CT) performed for close evaluation of other diseases. In a 57-year-old woman diagnosed with reactive lymphoid hyperplasia on the dorsal portion of the pancreas head, CT detected a 15 mm oval-shaped submucosal lesion at the jejunum. In an 87-year-old woman diagnosed with type 2 adenocarcinoma occupying the sigmoid colon, CT detected a round-shaped submucosal tumor 15 mm in diameter in the jejunum. Both cases were histologically diagnosed as type 1 HP according to the classification by Heinrich. Contrast-enhanced CT revealed that the CT analyses of HP and pancreatic parenchyma were nearly identical in the arterial phase, but in the equilibrium phase, contrast enhancement persisted longer in HP than in the pancreatic parenchyma. There has been no report of asymptomatic jejunal HP preoperatively diagnosed by CT. These cases are presented with a review of the literature, particularly focusing on CT findings.
