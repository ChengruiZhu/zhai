Esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC) is a deadly human cancer that develops in the lower esophagus, which is exposed to reflux of acidic stomach contents and has reduced microbial diversity. Next generation sequencing studies have shown that accumulation of somatic mutations occurs along the metaplasia–dysplasia–carcinoma sequence in EAC, and it has been proposed that groups of genes involved in similar processes or pathways could have a cumulative effect. The Toll-like receptor (TLR) signalling pathway is critical for host-microbe interaction, and therefore mutations in these pathways could be important in the pathogenesis of EAC. Here we show that TLR pathway genes are recurrently mutated in 15% of EAC tumours and other solid tumour types exposed to microbial communities, including uterine endometrioid carcinoma (59%), cutaneous melanoma (38%), colorectal adenocarcinoma (27%), and stomach adenocarcinoma (26%). TLR mutant cases were associated with more proximal tumours and metastatic disease, indicating possible clinical significance of these mutations. A better understanding of how altered TLR signalling contributes to the inflammatory tumour microenvironment in EAC could help inform cancer prevention strategies.
