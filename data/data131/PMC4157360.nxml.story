We evaluated the effects of an injectable complex of β-tricalcium phosphate (β-TCP) granules, hyaluronate, and recombinant human fibroblast growth factor-2 (rhFGF-2) on repair of unstable intertrochanteric fractures in elderly patients. Twenty-five patients (range, 76-91 years) having 31.A2 fractures (AO classification) were treated with injection of the complex followed by intramedullary nails. Bone regeneration and β-TCP resorption, unions of intertrochanteric fractures and displaced lesser trochanters to the shaft, and varus deformity of the femoral neck were assessed by X-ray and CT scans. Fracture union occurred in all cases and union of the displaced lesser trochanter to the shaft was obtained in 24 cases by 12 weeks. It is of interest that β-TCP granules were completely resorbed and marked new bone formation around the lesser trochanter was observed in all cases compared to cases not treated with the complex. Based on the results of intertrochanteric fractures, we applied this technique to two patients with subtrochanteric or humeral fractures in elderly patients, and obtained bone union. This complex is a paste-like material that is easy to handle, and it may be of considerable use in treatment of both unstable intertrochanteric fractures and other cortical bone defects with minimal surgical invasion.
