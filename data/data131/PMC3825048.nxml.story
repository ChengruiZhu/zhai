The purpose of this work was to create a rapid and simple instrument to evaluate the benefits of a hearing aid, that was at the same time reliable and complete. We created a new questionnaire by integration of other well consolidated psychometric tests to better investigate all the aspects that contribute in determining the hearing aid benefit, also considering as important some areas that are not usually considered (spatiality and quality of sound). We started from a 36-item questionnaire divided in six subscales (spatiality and quality of signal, intelligibility in silence, background noise intelligibility, averseness and reverberation), and submitted it to patients before hearing aid application and at 2-3 months after that. A statistically significant difference between results before and after hearing aid application was found. To obtain the final 30-item questionnaire, we analyzed the reliability of each subscale using Cronbach's alpha coefficient, and eliminated the item whose internal consistency was lower for every subscale. For these reasons, the CISQ questionnaire is a rapid and simple test that can be considered a reliable and complete instrument to evaluate the benefits of a hearing aid.
