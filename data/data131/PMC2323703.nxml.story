 The flat type of dried collodion membrane used by Michaelis and his associates in numerous investigations has been subjected to mensuration in order that the dimensions of these membranes may be placed on record. The membranes had a functioning area of about 30 cm., were approximately 0.1 mm. in thickness and were composed on the average of 87 per cent by volume of collodion and 13 per cent by volume of pores. In reviewing some of the previously reported results of diffusion experiments with non-electrolytes in the light of the calculated values for the total pore area for the same membranes additional evidence was presented to show that a smaller molecule (acetone) probably utilizes a much larger percentage of the total pore area for its diffusion than is available for a larger molecule (glycerol). By using the figures of Fricke and McClendon for the thickness of the membrane of the red blood cell some comparisons were drawn between the dried collodion membrane as a model for certain biological membranes and the red blood cell membrane. In these comparisons emphasis was placed on the exaggerated importance of small electromotive forces and very slight permeabilities when these were associated with membranes of such extreme thinness as the red blood cell membrane.
