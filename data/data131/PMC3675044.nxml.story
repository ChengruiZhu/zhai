Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) produces its structural proteins and key enzymes in the form of polyproteins, from which the individual proteins need to be released in a complex and tightly regulated series of cleavage reactions to give rise to a morphologically mature, infectious virus particle. This process is catalyzed by a viral protease (PR), which is itself embedded in one of the polyproteins, and is one of the main targets of antiretroviral drugs. We have developed the first full reaction kinetics model that addresses the several layers of complexity (multiple cleavage sites and substrates; multiple enzyme forms; PR auto-processing) associated with the proteolytic processing of HIV polyproteins. The model allows us to identify the rate limiting step of virion maturation and the parameters with the strongest effect on maturation kinetics. We predict how changes in the individual cleavage rates and the effects of drugs might interact and possibly compensate each other, characterize the detailed time course of the process, and explain why the effectiveness of PR inhibitors rises very steeply at a critical threshold concentration of the drugs. These new insights promote our understanding of the viral life cycle and may guide the future development of antiviral drugs.
