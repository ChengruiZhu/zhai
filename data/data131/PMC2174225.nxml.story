Two collagen receptors, integrins α1β1 and α2β1, can regulate distinct functions in cells. Ligation of α1β1, unlike α2β1, has been shown to result in recruitment of Shc and activation of the Ras/ERK pathway. To identify the downstream signaling molecules activated by α2β1 integrin, we have overexpressed wild-type α2, or chimeric α2 subunit with α1 integrin cytoplasmic domain in human osteosarcoma cells (Saos-2) lacking endogenous α2β1. The chimeric α2/α1 chain formed a functional heterodimer with β1. In contrast to α2/α1 chimera, forced expression of α2 integrin resulted in upregulation of α1 (I) collagen gene transcription in response to three-dimensional collagen, indicating that the cytoplasmic domain of α2 integrin was required for signaling. Furthermore, signals mediated by α2β1 integrin specifically activated the p38α isoform, and selective p38 inhibitors blocked upregulation of collagen gene transcription. Dominant negative mutants of Cdc42, MKK3, and MKK4 prevented α2β1 integrin–mediated activation of p38α. RhoA had also some inhibitory effect, whereas dominant negative Rac was not effective. Our findings show the isoform-specific activation of p38 by α2β1 integrin ligation and identify Cdc42, MKK3, and MKK4 as possible downstream effectors. These observations reveal a novel signaling mechanism of α2β1 integrin that is distinct from ones previously described for other integrins.
