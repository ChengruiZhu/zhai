Sample consisted of 180 patients (207 knees), 124 boys and 56 girls. Average age at diagnosis was 12.8 years (7.5-17.5). Majority were active in sports (80.8%), primary soccer (36.7%) and basketball (29.4%). JOCD was present bilaterally in 27 patients (15%), 14 knees had bifocal OCD (6.8%), and only 1 patient had bifocal lesions in both knees. Most common location was medial femoral condyle (56.3%) followed by lateral femoral condyle (23.1%), trochlea (11.4%), patella (9%), and tibia (0.5%). In the sagittal view, most common location was the middle third of the condyles (48.7%). Surgery was performed in 72 knees (34.8%), with an average age at surgery of 14.1 years (9.3-18.1). Bilateral JOCD was present in 13 surgical patients (18.8%), but only 3 patients had bilateral surgery. Two operative patients had bifocal JOCD (2.7%) and surgery on both lesions. Location distribution did not differ between surgical and non-surgical lesions. The average normalized area of non-surgical JOCD lesions was 6.8 (0.1-18), whereas surgical lesions averaged a significantly higher area of 7.7 (0.5-17) (p=0.023). Average BMI was 21.6 versus 20.2 for surgical and non-surgical patients, respectively, significantly higher for those who underwent surgery (p=0.002). Most common procedure was fixation with 1.6 mm bioabsorbable nails (54.2%), using an average of 4 nails (1-9). Only 2 cases were fixed using metallic headless screws. Other surgical treatments were drilling (13.9%), microfracture (13.9%), microfracture + fixation (6.9%), removal of loose body/chondroplasty (6.9%), and allograft transplantation (4.2%). Fixation was achieved all-arthroscopic in 43.1% of the cases, and 61.3% of the lesions that were fixed underwent curettage of the subchondral bone. Revision surgery was required in 14 knees (19.4%). The most common revision procedures were microfracture, removal of hardware, chondroplasty and allograft implantation, where some revisions had combined procedures. Most surgical patients had postoperative MRIs (55 knees), with an average radiological follow-up of 14.5 months (range 2.1-55.4).
