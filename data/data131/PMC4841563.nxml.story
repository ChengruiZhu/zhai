The widely used statistical methods test interaction for single phenotype. However, we often observe pleotropic genetic interaction effects. The simultaneous gene-gene (GxG) interaction analysis of multiple complementary traits will increase statistical power to detect GxG interactions. Although GxG interactions play an important role in uncovering the genetic structure of complex traits, the statistical methods for detecting GxG interactions in multiple phenotypes remains less developed owing to its potential complexity. Therefore, we extend functional regression model from single variate to multivariate for simultaneous GxG interaction analysis of multiple correlated phenotypes. Large-scale simulations are conducted to evaluate Type I error rates for testing interaction between two genes with multiple phenotypes and to compare power with traditional multivariate pair-wise interaction analysis and single trait interaction analysis by a single variate functional regression model. To further evaluate performance, the MFRG for interaction analysis is applied to five phenotypes of exome sequence data from the NHLBIâ€™s Exome Sequencing Project (ESP) to detect pleiotropic GxG interactions. 267 pairs of genes that formed a genetic interaction network showed significant evidence of interactions influencing five traits.
