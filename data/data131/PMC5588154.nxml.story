Previous studies have demonstrated that fibulin-2 may facilitate cancer cell invasion and metastasis during tumor progression. In the present study, immunohistochemical analyses of fibulin-2 and collagen IV expression in 35 patients with breast cancer were performed to define their localization and association with breast cancer tissue. Fibulin-2 was revealed to be expressed in all tissues surrounding the breast ducts and blood vessels in normal breast tissue, while its expression was not integrated in invasive ductal carcinoma or terminal duct-lobular unit. In malignant breast tissue, collagen IV was integrated around the duct, while fibulin-2 was expressed around collagen IV and was incomplete. These results demonstrated that fibulin-2 was associated with breast cancer invasion. Fibulin-2 expression decreased prior to basement membrane (BM) degradation, indicating that fibulin-2 forms an additional barrier around the BM. Therefore, it was proposed that fibulin-2 composes the general BM, which differs from the traditional BM. These results provide insight into extracellular matrix components and the involvement of fibulin-2 in tumor invasion and metastasis. Fibulin-2 was involved in the process of breast cancer development. It performed an important role in prevention of cancer cell penetration and metastasis.
