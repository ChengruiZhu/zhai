Although survival of extremely low birth weight (ELBW) infants dramatically improved over last decades, bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) rate has not changed. The use of indomethacin prophylaxis in ELBW infants results in improved short-term outcomes with no effect on long-term outcomes. The addition of fluid restriction to the indomethacin prophylaxis policy could result in a reduction of BPD and improve long-term survival without neurosensory impairment at 18 months corrected age. To determine the effect of a policy of fluid restriction compared with a policy of no fluid restriction on morbidity and mortality in ELBW infants receiving indomethacin prophylaxis. The standard search strategy for the Cochrane Neonatal Review Group was used. This included search of OVID MEDLINE-National Library of Medicine, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL, The Cochrane Library, Issue 8, 2011). Additional search included conference proceedings, references in articles, and unpublished data. All randomized or quasi-randomized trials that compared fluid restriction and indomethacin prophylaxis vs. indomethacin prophylaxis alone in ELBW infants were included. Standard methods of the Cochrane Neonatal Review Group were planned to assess the methodological quality of the trials. Review Manager 5 software was planned to be used for statistical analysis. We found no randomized controlled trials to investigate the possible interaction between fluid restriction and indomethacin prophylaxis vs. indomethacin prophylaxis alone in ELBW infants. A well-designed randomized trial is needed to address this question.
