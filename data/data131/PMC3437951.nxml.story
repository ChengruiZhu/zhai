CRVO cases were more likely than controls to have high homocysteine (odds ratio [OR] 8.64, 95% confidence intervals [CI]: 1.96–38), high anticardiolipin immunoglobulin M (IgM; OR 6.26, 95% CI: 1.4–28.2), and high Factor VIII (OR 2.47, 95% CI: 1.31–7.9). CRAO-AF cases were more likely than controls to have high homocysteine (OR 14, 95% CI: 2.7–71.6) or the lupus anticoagulant (OR 4.1, 95% CI: 1.3–13.2). In four of 77 women with CRVO (two found to have high homocysteine, two with inherited high Factor XI), CRVO occurred after starting estrogen–progestins, estrogen–testosterone, or estrogen agonists. In one of eight women with CRAO found to have high anticardiolipin antibody IgG, CRAO occurred after starting conjugated estrogens, and AF occurred after starting conjugated estrogens in one of eleven women with AF (inherited protein S deficiency). Therapy for medians of 21 months (CRVO) and 6 months (CRAO-AF) was 5 mg folic acid, 100 mg B6, and 2000 mcg/day B12 normalized homocysteine in 13 of 16 (81%) CRVO cases and all five CRAO-AF cases with pretreatment hyperhomocysteinemia. The CRVO cases had an excess of hypertension; CRAO-AF cases had an excess of type 2 diabetes and hypertension.
