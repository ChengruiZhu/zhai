Visfatin is a recently discovered adipokine that contributes to glucose and obesity-related conditions. This study investigates Visfatin RS4730153 polymorphism from the perspectives of its relations with glucose/lipid metabolism and its influence on the effects of exercise-induced weight loss. Eighty-eight obese Han Chinese children and adolescents were randomly selected from a 2008 Shanghai Weight Loss Summer Camp and were supervised to complete a 4 week aerobic exercise training program. Significant differences were observed in before-exercise TG value and exercise-induced HOMA-β change, with the AG group having a much higher TG value than the GG group (P ≤ 0.05), and the latter exhibiting a significantly larger before-and-after exercise HOMA-β change than the former (P ≤ 0.05). However, no significant difference was observed between the two groups in before exercise indices of body shape, function and quality, nor in exercise-induced changes of body shape, function, and quality. Findings suggest that Visfatin RS4730153 homozygous GG genotype may effect adjustment of glucose and lipid metabolism in obese children and adolescents by reducing TG levels and increasing insulin sensitivity to exercise.
