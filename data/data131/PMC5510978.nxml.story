Endovascular mechanical thrombectomy for stroke patients with large vessel occlusion (LVO) in the anterior circulation has become the standard of care based on several major randomized clinical trials. The successful result reported by these trials constitutes what may be the largest achievement in the history of neurological sciences. However, most of these mechanical thrombectomy trials (except for the multicenter randomized clinical trial of endovascular treatment for acute ischemic stroke in the Netherlands, i.e., MR CLEAN and Extending the Time for Thrombolysis in Emergency Neurological Deficitsâ€“Intra-Arterial, i.e., EXTEND-IA) excluded stroke patients with minor to mild stroke symptoms with National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) scores of six to eight or lower. The median NIHSS score for patients who underwent acute endovascular thrombectomy was approximately 15 to 17 in all trials. To date, the evidence is lacking to support the mechanical thrombectomy in patients with acute stroke and LVO with minor to mild severity on NIHSS score. The purpose of this review was to assess the current data, safety and clinical outcomes in stroke patients with minor to mild symptoms who were treated with endovascular thrombectomy.
