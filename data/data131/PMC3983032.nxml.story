The proper regulation of gene expression is of fundamental importance in the maintenance of normal growth and development. Misregulation of genes can lead to such outcomes as cancer, diabetes and neurodegenerative disease. A key step in gene regulation occurs during the transcription of the chromosomal DNA into messenger RNA by the enzyme, RNA polymerase II. Histones are small, positively charged proteins that package genomic DNA into arrays of bead-like particles termed nucleosomes, the principal components of chromatin. Increasing evidence suggests that nucleosomal histones play an active role in regulating transcription, and that this is derived in part from reversible chemical (“covalent”) modifications that take place on their amino acids. These histone modifications create novel surfaces on nucleosomes that can serve as docking sites for other proteins that control a gene's expression state. In this study we present evidence that contrary to the general case, covalent modifications typically associated with transcription are minimally used by genes embedded in a specialized, condensed chromatin structure termed heterochromatin in the model organism baker's yeast. Our observations are significant, for they suggest that gene transcription can occur in a living cell in the virtual absence of covalent modification of the chromatin template.
