Mouse polyclonal antibodies have been raised against two human proteins (IEF [isoelectric focusing] 31, Mr = 50,000; IEF 46, Mr = 43,500) that have previously been shown to be present in HeLa cytoskeletons enriched in intermediate-sized filaments. Immunoprecipitation studies show that both proteins share common antigenic determinants with each other and with the putative human keratins IEF 36 and 44, also present in HeLa cytoskeletons. Indirect immunofluorescence studies showed that both antibodies revealed similar filamentous networks in various cultured epithelial cells of human origin. These included AMA (transformed amnion), HeLa (cervical carcinoma), normal amnion cells, Fl-amnion (transformed amnion), WISH-amnion (transformed amnion), Chang liver (liver), and Detroid-98 (sternal marrow). Human cells that did not react with both antibodies included skin fibroblasts, lung fibroblasts (WI-38), SV40-transformed lung fibroblasts, Molt 4 (leukemia), lymphocytes, and monocytes. These results were in complete agreement with the presence or absence of both proteins in two-dimensional gels of the different cell types. Exposure of AMA cells to demecolcine (24 h; 10 micrograms/ml) caused the total collapse of vimentin filaments but, as seen by indirect immunofluorescence, caused only a partial redistribution of the IEF 31 and 46 filaments. These results are taken to suggest that both proteins are components of the intermediate-sized filaments of the "keratin" type. The antibodies could be clearly differentiated by staining human bladder carcinoma EJ 19 cells, as only the IEF 46 antibody stained a filamentous network in these cells The occurrence of keratins IEF 31, 36, 44, and 46 in different cultured human epithelial cells has been studied using two-dimensional gel electrophoresis.
