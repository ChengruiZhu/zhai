Solitary fibrous tumors (SFT) are a rare type of mesenchymal-derived tumor not commonly found in the pediatric population, especially in the head and neck. Tumors of this nature are most commonly seen in the adult population and are identified with unique immunohistochemical markers, specifically signal transducer and activator of transcription 6 (STAT6) and hematopoietic progenitor cell antigen (CD34). Including SFTs in the differential diagnosis while working up a mass can be difficult considering their relatively non-descript appearance on imaging and the low yield immunohistochemical staining that must be ordered to confirm diagnosis. The current literature identifies only a handful of cases of SFTs occurring in the pediatric population, with a majority arising from the pleura. We present the case of a 13-year-old male who underwent radical excision of a left occipital triangle neck mass after radiological and pathological workup failed to conclusively make a diagnosis. Postoperative pathologic analysis revealed it to be an SFT. Due to the exceptionally rare presentation of SFTs in pediatric patients, the aim of this case report is to discuss diagnostic measures, solitary fibrous tumor etiology, as well as a recent risk stratification system used for the evaluation of postoperative disease progression. Our hope is that clinicians will include SFTs in their differential diagnosis when working up a neck mass in the pediatric population.
