A 6-year-old boy was referred to our hospital with orbital cellulitis. He had a history of 7 days of fever despite antibiotherapy. At first, he only had pharyngitis and conjunctivitis, but then an orbital mass evolved which restricted the movement of his right eye and there was also periorbital inflammation resembling orbital cellulitis. Examination at presentation revealed conjunctivitis with secretion, periocular inflammation and edema, right-preauricular lymphadenopathy and restriction of upgaze in the right eye. Laboratory findings included a white blood cell count of 19,000 cells per mm3, with 81.5% neutrophils, 15.0% lymphocytes, 1.2% monocytes and 0.4% basophils. The erythrocyte sedimentation rate was 52 mm/h and the C-reactive protein level was 46.3 mg/dl. Magnetic resonance imaging confirmed orbital cellulitis and pansinusitis. Vancomycin (60 mg/kg/day) and meropenem (100 mg/kg/day) were administered, but desquamation on his fingertips and a rash appeared on the tenth day. A pediatric consultation resulted in a diagnosis of incomplete Kawasaki disease (KD). After administration of aspirin, the orbital inflammation regressed in 3 days. No coronary artery lesions were detected on the first echocardiography, but these did appear 6 weeks later. This confirmed the KD diagnosis.
