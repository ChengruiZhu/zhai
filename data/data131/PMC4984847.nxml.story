This paper illustrates how multiple scattering signatures affect Global Precipitation Measuring (GPM) Mission Dual‐Frequency Precipitation Radar (DPR) Ku and Ka band reflectivity measurements and how they are consistent with prelaunch assessments based on theoretical considerations and confirmed by airborne observations. In particular, in the presence of deep convection, certain characteristics of the dual‐wavelength reflectivity profiles cannot be explained with single scattering, whereas they are readily explained by multiple‐scattering theory. Examples of such signatures are the absence of surface reflectivity peaks and anomalously small reflectivity slopes in the lower troposphere. These findings are relevant for DPR‐based rainfall retrievals and stratiform/convective classification algorithms when dealing with deep convective regions. A path to refining the rainfall inversion problem is proposed by adopting a methodology based on a forward operator which accounts for multiple scattering. A retrieval algorithm based on this methodology is applied to a case study over Africa, and it is compared to the standard DPR products obtained with the at‐launch version of the standard algorithms.
