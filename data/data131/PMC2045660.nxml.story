The first case is a woman with a history of desmoplastic melanoma of the scalp with previous local recurrences and lymph node metastasis with a new submandibular mass. The second case is a man with a previously resected desmoplastic melanoma with his first local recurrence. Conventional smears, including air-dried Diff-Quik-stained and alcohol-fixed Papanicolaou-stained smears, demonstrated aggregates of pleomorphic spindle cells admixed with fibrous stroma and single spindle cells. In both cases, nuclei were elongated and plump with irregular nuclear contours, deep grooves, and folds. Chromatin was dark and coarse with either inconspicuous or multiple prominent nucleoli. Cytoplasm was located at the nuclear poles and was fine, wispy, and delicate. The background was clean with no evidence of necrosis or melanin pigment. Papanicolaou-stained ThinPrep slides were prepared from needle rinses and demonstrated excellent correlation of nuclear and cytoplasmic detail of single spindle cells to that seen on conventional smears with the exception of only slight decrease in nuclear size; however, nuclear and cytoplasmic detail of spindle cells embedded in stroma was markedly attenuated.
