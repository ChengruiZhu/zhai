Survival during starvation depends largely on metabolic energy, which is stored in the form of neutral lipids in specialized organelles known as lipid droplets. The precursors for the synthesis of neutral lipids are also used for membrane biogenesis, which is required for cell growth and proliferation. Therefore cells must possess mechanisms to preferentially channel lipid precursors toward either membrane synthesis or lipid droplet storage, in response to nutrient status. How this partitioning is spatially regulated within the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) where lipid droplets co-localize, remains poorly understood. We have recently shown that at the onset of starvation lipid droplets concentrate at a perinuclear ER subdomain flanking the nucleus-vacuole junction (NVJ) and that this is crucial for maintaining proper nuclear shape and ER membrane organization. Here we show that disruption of the NVJ does not block the translocation and internalization of lipid droplets into the vacuole for their degradation, which takes place at later stages of starvation. We propose that alternative pathways of lipid droplet translocation from the ER to the vacuole may exist to enable stationary phase-induced lipophagy.
