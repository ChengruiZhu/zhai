Daily nutrition, in addition to being a source of energy, contains micronutrients, a class of nutrients including vitamins which are essential for life and which act by orchestrating a vast number of developmental and physiological processes. During metabolism, micronutrients are frequently transformed into their bioactive forms. Nuclear hormone receptors are a family of proteins functioning as ligand-regulated transcription factors which can sense such bioactive molecules and translate those signals into transcriptional, adaptive responses. Retinoid X receptors occupy a central place in this signaling as they directly interact, and thereby control, activities of several nuclear hormone receptors. We report here the identification of a novel bioactive form of vitamin A, which is the first endogenous form of this vitamin capable to bind and activate retinoid X receptors. Accordingly, we show that this single molecule displays biological activity similar to synthetic agonists of retinoid X receptors and coordinates transcriptional activities of several nuclear receptor signaling pathways. Those findings may have immediate biomedical implications, as retinoid X receptors are implicated in the control of a number of physiological functions and their pathology.
