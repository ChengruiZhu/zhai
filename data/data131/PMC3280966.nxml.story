Most organs of higher organisms, such as the vascular system, lung, kidney, pancreas, liver and glands, are heavily branched structures. The branching process during lung development has been studied in great detail and is remarkably stereotyped. The branched tree is generated by the sequential, non-random use of three geometrically simple modes of branching. While the branching sequence is identical in mice of identical genetic background it differs between mouse strains. This suggests that the positioning of branch points and the type of branching sensitively depends on information encoded in the genome. Encoding every branching point independently in the genome would require a large number of genes, and it is more likely that a recursive, self-organized process exists that determines the patterning. While many regulatory molecules have been identified an integrated understanding of the regulatory network (program) is missing. Based on available experimental data we have developed a model for lung branching. The model correctly predicts branching phenotypes in mutants and suggests that also the growth speed of the lung tip can affect the positioning and type of the next branching event.
