The mammalian brain consists of a network of chemically diverse, multiscale, and multilayer neuronal wiring patterns that form the physical infrastructure underlying the processing of motoric, sensory, emotional, and cognitive information. Decades of histological track-tracing studies have generated a set of highly valuable yet disorganized data, which is very hard to retrieve in a hypothesis-free manner. We present an open-access database (ChemNetDB) that organizes over 50 years of neuroanatomical track-tracing and neurochemical measurements from 36,464 rats. This neurochemical connectome is terminologically consistent and shares several network invariants with mouse and macaque cortical networks, suggesting that the mammalian brain exhibits universal structural features. Furthermore, several network measures reflect and confirm the key functional roles of deep subcortical brain areas, which are known to be responsible for primitive, yet essential and evolutionary conserved functions related to survival. ChemNetDB provides the first whole-brain, multiscale, and consistently collated rat connectome database. ChemNetDB also includes neurochemical specificity and represents a powerful tool for in vitro, in vivo, and in silico investigations of brain function and disorders.
