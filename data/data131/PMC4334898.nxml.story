Consumption of sugar and lipid (fat) enriched food increases the risk of developing metabolic diseases and cancers. However, lipids are essential molecules for life, as they are the major components of cell membranes. Metabolism refers to biochemical reactions that transform nutrients into molecules required by an organism, although toxic by-products can also formed. Sugars or their derivatives are likely to induce toxic effects by forming stable conjugates with proteins. To neutralize their toxic potential, sugars are metabolized and stored as fat. Here, we have used the fruitfly model to investigate the consequences of lipogenesis deficiency upon ingestion of sugar-enriched diets. We show that lipogenesis deficient animals are dramatically sensitive to dietary sugar. Further, we have identified the sugar by-product responsible for intracellular toxicity, in the context of lipogenesis inhibition. Our study reveals that inhibiting lipogenesis does not disrupt cellular growth if extracellular lipids are available. In contrast lipogenesis inhibition may have deleterious consequences due to accumulation of toxic by-products. The efficacy of lipogenic inhibitors in fighting cancers and metabolic diseases is currently under investigation. Therefore, to evaluate the clinical benefit of these inhibitors, accumulation of the toxic molecules should be monitored in both sick and healthy cells.
