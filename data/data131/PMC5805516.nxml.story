Invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC) is a common histological type of breast cancer. The aim of this study was to identify the potential crucial genes associated with IDC and to provide valid biological information for further investigations. The gene expression profiles of GSE10780 which contained 42 histologically normal breast tissues and 143 IDC tissues were downloaded from the GEO database. Functional and pathway enrichment analysis of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were performed and protein-protein interaction (PPI) network was analyzed using Cytoscape. In total, 999 DEGs were identified, including 667 up-regulated and 332 down-regulated DEGs. Gene ontology analysis demonstrated that most DEGs were significantly enriched in mitotic cell cycle, adhesion and protein binding process. Through PPI network analysis, a significant module was screened out, and the top 10 hub genes, CDK1, CCNB1, CENPE, CENPA, PLK1, CDC20, MAD2L1, HIST1H2BK, KIF2C and CCNA2 were identified from the PPI network. The expression levels of the 10 genes were validated in Oncomine database. KIF2C, MAD2L1 and PLK1 were associated with the overall survival. And we used cBioPortal to explore the genetic alterations of hub genes and potential drugs. In conclusion, the present study identified DEGs between normal and IDC samples, which could improve our understanding of the molecular mechanisms in the development of IDC, and these candidate genes might be used as therapeutic targets for IDC.
