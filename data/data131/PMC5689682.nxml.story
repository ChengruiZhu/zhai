 mutated ctDNA and total circulating cell-free DNA (cfDNA) in colorectal cancer (CRC) patients (n=50) from various stages and healthy controls (n=8) by Intplex allele-specific and digital droplet PCR. In addition, the impact of two prominent extraction techniques (silica-based membrane vs. magnetic beads) on cfDNA and ctDNA recovery was analyzed in 38 paired samples from CRC patients and specific spike-in DNA controls. CfDNA fragment size was assessed using the Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer. Relative quantities of total cfDNA quantities were measured using the Qubit fluorometer. Statistical analysis on total cfDNA yield revealed a strong correlation (r=0.976) between Qubit and absolute Intplex allele-specific PCR measurements in cancer patients and healthy controls. Total cfDNA was significantly increased in cancer patients compared to healthy controls, with the highest yield in distant metastatic disease. In line, the highest amount of ctDNA (1.35 ng/Î¼L) was found in patients with distant organ metastasis. Of great interest, the silica-based membrane method significantly promoted extraction of long cfDNA fragments. In contrast, the magnetic bead system more efficiently recovered short cfDNA fragments in serum of cancer patients. Further, a decreased
