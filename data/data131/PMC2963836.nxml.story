Recent reports have indicated an increasing prevalence of HIV infection in the mentally ill. Reports have also emphasised the etiological role of HIV infection in psychiatric illness. The aim of this study was to assess the clinical and risk profile of psychiatric inpatients found seropositive for HIV infection. All psychiatric inpatients from a psychiatric hospital who tested positive for HI V infection over a five year period were assessed. The assessments included a detailed clinical history, psychiatric assessment and risk behaviour evaluation. Of the 2283 psychiatric patients tested, 51 were found to be seropositive. 43 patients were included in the study. 30 (69.7%) had a diagnosis of alcohol dependence, of which, 11 patients had comorbid psychiatnc diagnosis in the form of affective disorders (23%) and psychosis (14%). Personality disorders were seen in 9 patients. In 19% the clinical manifestation was considered to be etiologically related to HIV infection. The predominant risk behaviour was in the form of multiple partner heterosexual contacts. In several patients the risk behaviour had occurred during an episode of mental illness or under the influence of alcohol. The study demonstrates the importance of detecting and describing HIV infection and its manifestation among psychiatric patients.
