Prominent eyelashes are generally recognized as enhancing beauty and are often desired by women. Until recently, the options available to augment the prominence of eyelashes were limited to makeup, over-the-counter products, artificial eyelashes, and eyelash transplantation. Originally approved for the treatment of ocular hypertension, the prostamide, bimatoprost, is now approved for the treatment of hypotrichosis of the eyelashes. Bimatoprost ophthalmic solution 0.03%, applied once daily to the skin of the upper eyelid margin using sterile single-use-per-eye applicators, increases eyelash growth, including length, thickness, and darkness. The effectiveness of bimatoprost for eyelash growth has been demonstrated by clinician ratings, digital image analysis, and patient-reported measures of satisfaction. The effects of bimatoprost treatment on eyelash length, thickness, and darkness are believed to result from longer anagen duration, increased hair bulb thickness, and increased melanogenesis, respectively. Dermally applied bimatoprost appears to be associated with a lower incidence of adverse events than administration of the medication as an eyedrop. This more favorable safety and tolerability profile is likely mediated by decreased exposure of ocular tissues to bimatoprost when applied dermally. Taken together, available data suggest that cutaneous application of bimatoprost ophthalmic solution 0.03% safely and effectively enhances upper eyelash growth.
