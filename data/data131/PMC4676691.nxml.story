Small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) are double stranded RNA molecules designed to perfectly match the sequence of a target gene and silence its expression. The function is exerted through the RNA interference (RNAi) pathway and has revolutionised biological research due to its ease-of-use and high potency. While siRNAs were initially believed to be highly specific, they have subsequently been observed to interact with other, unintended messenger RNAs. However, the mechanistic details of this process remain poorly understood, and there is a paucity of strategies and guidelines directed toward mitigating this issue. To address this potential safety liability, we performed a comprehensive analysis of sequence characteristics of siRNA duplexes and their target regions. Results from luciferase-reporter assays and global expression data confirmed previous observations that the siRNA seed region is the primary determinant for off-target gene recognition and binding. Furthermore, our analysis revealed the important contribution of siRNA non-seed region, and its corresponding target sequences, to the potency of off-target knockdown. Similar results were observed in an equivalent evaluation of the miRNA-targeting mechanism, suggesting that the correlating features arise through an evolutionary conserved mechanistic factor.
