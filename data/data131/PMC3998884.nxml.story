Understanding large-scale neuronal dynamics – and how they relate to the cortical anatomy – is one of the key areas of neuroscience research. Despite a wealth of recent research, the key principles of this relationship have yet to be established. Here we employ computational modeling to study neuronal dynamics on small subgraphs – or motifs – across a hierarchy of spatial scales. We establish a novel organizing principle that we term a “resonance pair” (two mutually coupled nodes), which promotes stable, zero-lag synchrony amongst motif nodes. The bidirectional coupling between a resonance pair acts to mutually adjust their dynamics onto a common and relatively stable synchronized regime, which then propagates and stabilizes the synchronization of other nodes within the motif. Remarkably, we find that this effect can propagate along chains of coupled nodes and hence holds the potential to promote stable zero-lag synchrony in larger sub-networks of cortical systems. Our findings hence suggest a potential unifying account of the existence of zero-lag synchrony, an important phenomenon that may underlie crucial cognitive processes in the brain. Moreover, such pairs of mutually coupled oscillators are found in a wide variety of physical and biological systems suggesting a new, broadly relevant and unifying principle.
