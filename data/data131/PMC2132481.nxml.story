Cells that express wild-type influenza hemagglutinin (HA) fully fuse to RBCs, while cells that express the HA-ectodomain anchored to membranes by glycosylphosphatidylinositol, rather than by a transmembrane domain, only hemifuse to RBCs. Amphipaths were inserted into inner and outer membrane leaflets to determine the contribution of each leaflet in the transition from hemifusion to fusion. When inserted into outer leaflets, amphipaths did not promote the transition, independent of whether the agent induces monolayers to bend outward (conferring positive spontaneous monolayer curvature) or inward (negative curvature). In contrast, when incorporated into inner leaflets, positive curvature agents led to full fusion. This suggests that fusion is completed when a lipidic fusion pore with net positive curvature is formed by the inner leaflets that compose a hemifusion diaphragm. Suboptimal fusion conditions were established for RBCs bound to cells expressing wild-type HA so that lipid but not aqueous dye spread was observed. While this is the same pattern of dye spread as in stable hemifusion, for this “stunted” fusion, lower concentrations of amphipaths in inner leaflets were required to promote transfer of aqueous dyes. Also, these amphipaths induced larger pores for stunted fusion than they generated within a stable hemifusion diaphragm. Therefore, spontaneous curvature of inner leaflets can affect formation and enlargement of fusion pores induced by HA. We propose that after the HA-ectodomain induces hemifusion, the transmembrane domain causes pore formation by conferring positive spontaneous curvature to leaflets of the hemifusion diaphragm.
