 in the presence of other ions inhibited. 3. The effect of pH is complex. In stabilizing buffers or at low temperature, there are two optima (pH 6.2 to 6.5 and pH 9.2) provided Ca is present. Without Ca only the acid optimum is found. The highest activities are reached in glycine buffer at pH 9.2 in the presence of Ca. 4. The study of the Mg-Ca antagonism revealed that the inhibition due to Mg is fully developed with Mg:Ca ratios less than 1, the inhibition usually exceeding 90 per cent. 5. It is shown that in the muscle the myosin-ATPase is most probably also subjected to the inhibitory action of the Mg ions. 6. From data in the literature it is calculated that the liberation of inorganic phosphate during muscular activity takes place at a rate of at least 0.200 mg. P per mg. myosin per minute. 7. From the results of the present study it is found that the myosin in the muscle can liberate inorganic phosphate from ATP at a rate of at most 0.003 mg. P per mg. myosin per minute. 8. It is concluded therefore that myosin-ATPase cannot be responsible for the liberation of the main part of the phosphate in contracting muscle, and therefore cannot have the r√¥le in muscular metabolism ascribed to it in recent hypotheses and discussions.
