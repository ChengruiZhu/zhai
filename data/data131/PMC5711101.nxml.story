The necessity to build or adapt radiotherapy rooms in reduced areas leads to the search for unconventional solutions for shielding projects. In most cases, adding metals to the primary barriers is the best alternative to shield rooms properly. However, when photons with energies equal or higher than 10 MV interact with high atomic number nuclei, neutrons are ejected and may result in a radioprotection problem for both outside and inside the room. Currently, the most widely used mathematical model to estimate the neutron dose equivalents, beyond the barriers composed by concrete and metal, is applicable only in very specific conditions. Moreover, a validation work of this model had not yet been performed. In this work, the Monte Carlo code MCNPX was used to check the validity of the aforementioned mathematical model for cases of primary barriers containing steel or lead sheets, considering the existence of linear accelerators of 15 or 18 MV. The results of the study showed that over 80% of the values obtained by computational simulations revealed deviations above a factor of 2, when compared to the analytical formula. This led to the conclusion that the McGinley method cannot be considered an adequate mathematical model to describe the mentioned physical phenomenon.
