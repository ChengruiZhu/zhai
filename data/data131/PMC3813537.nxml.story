Mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase kinase 2 (MEKK2) is an important upstream mediator of the extracellular signal-regulated kinase 5 signaling cascade that is essential for a number of cellular functions, including mitogenesis, differentiation and oncogenic transformation. Using western blotting to examine MEKK2 expression in 16 cases of primary colorectal cancer (CRC) lesions with paired normal mucosa, it was identified that MEKK2 is highly expressed in CRC lesions compared with that of the normal mucosa. Immunohistochemistry of 24 normal mucosa, 24 adenoma and 96 adenocarcinoma colorectal specimens indicated that the expression of MEKK2 was significantly increased in the adenoma and carcinoma specimens compared with that of the normal mucosa cases (P<0.0001 for both). However, no significant differences were detected in MEKK2 expression between the carcinoma and adenoma specimens (P=0.85). Similarly, no correlations were identified between MEKK2 expression and clinicopathological features, including gender, age, body mass index, histological differentiation, depth of invasion, lymph node metastasis, UICC stage and K-ras mutations (P>0.05). The present study demonstrated that MEKK2 functions as a promotive factor in CRC.
