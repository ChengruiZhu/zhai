The permeability properties of planar lipid bilayers made from egg lecithin, n-decane and a long-chain secondary amine (n-lauryl [trialkylmethyl]amine) are described. Membranes containing the secondary amine show halide selectivity and high conductance at pH less than 6, as estimated by measurements of zero-current potentials generated by NaBr activity gradients. In the absence of halide ions, the membranes show H+ selectivity, although the total membrane conductance is relatively low. In 0.1 M NaBr both the membrane conductance (Gm) and the Br- self-exchange flux (JBr) are proportional to H+ concentration over the pH range of 7 to 4, and both JBr and Gm saturate at pH less than 4. However, JBr is always more than 100 times the flux predicted from Gm and the transference number for Br-. Thus, greater than 99% of the observed (tracer) flux is electrically silent and is not a Br2 or HBrO flux because the reducing agent, S2O3=, has no effect on JBr. At pH 7, JBr is proportional to Br- concentration over the range of 1-340 mM, with no sign of saturation kinetics. Both urea and sulfate tracer permeabilities are low and are unaffected by pH. The results can be explained by a model in which the secondary amine behaves as a monovalent, titratable carrier which exists in three chemical forms (C, CH+, and CHBr). Br- crosses the membrane primarily as the neurtal complex (CHBr). The positively charged carrier (CH+) crosses the membrane slowly compared to CHBr, but CH+ is the principal charge carrier in the membrane. At neurtal pH greater than 99% of the amine is in the nonfunctional form (C), which can be converted to CH+ or CHBr by increasing the H+ or Br- concentrations. The permeability properties of these lipid bilayers resemble in many respects the permeability properties of red cell membranes.
