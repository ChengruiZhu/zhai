The rat model of diabetic atherosclerosis was established successfully. Compared with the control group, glucose, triglycerides, total cholesterol, AST, ALT, BUN, fasting insulin and homeostatic model assessment insulin resistance levels in peripheral blood were significantly increased in the diabetes group. While, these indicators in the liraglutide group were significantly lower than that in the diabetes group. Moreover, the atherosclerotic plaques were observed in the rats of diabetes group but not remarkable in the liraglutide group. The ratio between aorta intima and media thickness was significantly greater in the diabetes group than that in the liraglutide group. Compared with the diabetes group, the infiltration and apoptosis of macrophages were milder in the liraglutide group. The expressions of CD68, caspase-3, CHOP and GRP78 in aorta tissue samples were significantly downregulated in the liraglutide group than that in the diabetes group. Furthermore, the microvesicles of aorta tissues in the liraglutide group were significantly decreased than that in the diabetes group. The mRNA expressions of SREBP-1c and FAS were lower in the liraglutide group than that in the diabetes group.
