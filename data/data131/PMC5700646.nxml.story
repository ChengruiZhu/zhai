Neural modulation technology and the capability to affect organ function have spawned the new field of bioelectronic medicine. Therapeutic interventions depend on wireless bioelectronic neural interfaces that can conformally and easily attach to small (few hundred micrometers) nerves located deep in the body without neural damage. Besides size, factors like flexibility and compliance to attach and adapt to visceral nerves associated moving organs are of paramount importance and have not been previously addressed. This study proposes a novel flexible neural clip (FNC) that can be used to interface with a variety of different peripheral nerves. To illustrate the flexibility of the design, this study stimulates the pelvic nerve, the vagus nerve, and branches of the sciatic nerve and evaluates the feasibility of the design in modulating the function of each of these nerves. It is found that this FNC allows fine‚Äêtuning of physiological processes such as micturition, heart rate, and muscle contractions. Furthermore, this study also tests the ability of wirelessly powered FNC to enable remote modulation of visceral pelvic nerves located deep in the body. These results show that the FNC can be used with a range of different nerves, providing one of the critical pieces in the field of bioelectronics medicines.
