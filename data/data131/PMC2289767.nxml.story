In a previous study, osteosarcoma cells expressing both 5-lipoxygenase (5-LO) and 5 lipoxygenase-activating protein (FLAP) synthesized leukotrienes upon A23187 stimulation (Dixon, R. A. F., R. E. Diehl, E. Opas, E. Rands, P. J. Vickers, J. F. Evans, J. W. Gillard, and D. K. Miller. 1990. Nature (Lond.). 343:282-284). Osteosarcoma cells expressing 5-LO but not expressing FLAP were unable to synthesize leukotrienes. Thus, it was determined that FLAP was required for the cellular synthesis of leukotrienes. To examine the role of FLAP in A23187-induced translocation of 5-LO to a membrane fraction, we have studied the A23187-stimulated translocation of 5-LO in osteosarcoma cells expressing both 5-LO and FLAP, and in osteosarcoma cells expressing 5-LO only. We demonstrate that in cells expressing both 5-LO and FLAP, 5-LO translocates to membranes in response to A23187 stimulation. This 5-LO translocation is inhibited when cells are stimulated in the presence of MK-886. In osteosarcoma cells expressing 5-LO but not expressing FLAP, 5-LO is able to associate with membranes following A23187 stimulation. In contrast to the cells containing both 5-LO and FLAP, MK-886 is unable to prevent 5-LO membrane association in cells transfected with 5-LO alone. Therefore, we have demonstrated that in this cell system, 5-LO membrane association and activation can be separated into at least two distinct steps: (1) calcium-dependent movement of 5-LO to membranes without product formation, which can occur in the absence of FLAP (membrane association), and (2) activation of 5-LO with product formation, which is FLAP dependent and inhibited by MK-886 (enzyme activation).
