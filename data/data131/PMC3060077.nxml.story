Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) exploit the correlation in genetic diversity along chromosomes in order to detect effects on disease risk without having to type causal loci directly. The inevitable downside of this approach is that, when the correlation between the marker and the causal variant is imperfect, the risk associated with carrying the predisposing allele is diluted and its effect is underestimated. Using simulations, where we know the true risk at the causal locus, we quantify the extent of this underestimation. We show that, for loci which have a modest effect on disease risk and are common in the population, the risk estimated from the most associated SNP is very close to the truth approximately two thirds of the time. Although the extent of the underestimation depends on assumptions about the frequency and strength of the risk allele, we predict that fine mapping of GWAS loci will, in rare cases, identify causal variants with considerably higher risk. Using three common diseases as examples, we investigate the expected cumulative effects of underestimation at multiple loci on our ability to stratify individuals by disease risk and to explain disease heritability.
