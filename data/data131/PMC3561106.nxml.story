The outer shell of an insect serves both as protective skin and rigid exoskeleton that must be periodically replaced with a new, larger one during development. During this molting process, the inner layers of the old exoskeleton are digested and recycled, while the outer layers are discarded. Secretion of the new skin necessarily commences before the partial recycling and shedding of the old shell. This creates a problem for the insect, namely how to protect the new skin from digestive enzymes intended for the old shell that closely enwraps it. Previously we showed that such protection is afforded by the Knickkopf (Knk) protein, which is secreted from the epidermis and infiltrates the new skin, rendering it resistant to enzymatic degradation. In this work, we show that another protein, called Retroactive (Rtv), ensures the proper trafficking of Knk into the newly secreted skin. Rtv remains inside the epidermal cells, while directing the transport of Knk to the cell surface and ensuring its export into the new skin. Digestive enzymes are then secreted and target the old exoskeleton while leaving the new one intact. This dependence of Knk on Rtv function is probably true for all insects and other arthropods.
