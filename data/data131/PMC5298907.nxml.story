Klebsiella pneumoniae (K.pneumoniae) is a known cause of pyogenic liver abscess (PLA) in the absence of hepatobiliary disease. In settings of hepatic infection, it has also been known to cause disseminated infections including meningitis and endopthalmitis. Several groups of patients are particularly susceptible to infection, including patients with diabetes mellitus, those from Southeast Asia and those with the preexisting hepatobiliary disease. We present a case of K.pneumoniae PLA with bacteremia. A 39-year-old Vietnamese male with no previous medical history who presented with complaints of abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea and fever. A computed tomography (CT) of the abdomen showed a large complex mass in the right lobe of the liver with multiple septations. Over course of hospitalization, the patient developed acute respiratory failure and was monitored in medical intensive care unit (MICU). Blood cultures grew K. pneumonia. The patient was treated with intravenous ceftriaxone and the abscess was drained by interventional radiology. After appropriate management, he progressed well during his hospital course and was eventually discharged from the hospital. K. pneumonia PLA had previously been an endemic disease in Southeast Asia, however, with a highly mobile patient population, it is now seen throughout the world and should be in the differential of patients who present with solitary liver mass in the setting of sepsis.
