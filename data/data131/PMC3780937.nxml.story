During the study period, a total of 352 malarial cases from 341 patients were diagnosed. Vivax malaria was most commonly developed in July and August, 24.7% (87/352), and 21.9% (77/352), respectively. The mean (SD) age was 42.5 (14.7) years and the number of male patients was 243 (71.3%). Six patients had a previous history of vivax malaria from 6 months to 10 years before. A total of 337 patients (98.8%) had fever and the mean (SD) body temperature was 38.3 (1.4)â„ƒ. Common associated symptoms were chills (213/341, 62.5%), headache (115/341, 33.7%), and myalgia (85/341, 24.9%). Laboratory findings included thrombocytopenia (340/341, 99.7%), anemia (97/341, 28.5%), leukopenia (148/341, 43.4%), increase of aspartate transaminase (177/341, 51.9%), and increase of alanine transaminase (187/341, 54.8%). Hypotension (14/341, 4.1%), altered mentality (3/341, 0.9%), azotemia (3/341, 0.9%), spleen infarction (2/341, 0.6%), and spleen rupture (1/341, 0.3%) developed as complications. Chloroquine was administered to all patients and primaquine was administered with mean (SD) 3.39 (0.82) mg/kg to 320 patients. There were 11 recurrent infections during the study period. The median (range) time to recurrent infection was 100 (32-285) days. Platelet counts were higher (86,550 vs. 56,910/mm
