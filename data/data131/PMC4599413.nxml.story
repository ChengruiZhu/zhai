Using sera from anti-Ro-exposed pregnancies resulting in offspring with CHB, no disease but CHB-sibling, and no disease and no CHB-sibling, as well as disease (lupus without anti-Ro) and healthy controls, reactivities were determined for binding to Ro60, p305, and an epitope within Ro60, p133-Ro60, which shares structural properties with p305, including key amino acids and an α-helical structure. Candidate peptides were further evaluated in an in vitro model that assessed the binding of maternal antibodies to apoptotic cells. In anti-Ro-positive mothers, anti-p305 autoantibodies (>3 SD above healthy controls) were detected in 3/59 (5%) CHB pregnancies, 4/30 (13%) unaffected pregnancies with a CHB-sibling, and 0/42 (0%) of unaffected pregnancies with no CHB-sibling. For umbilical bloods (61 CHB, 41 healthy with CHB sibling), no association of anti-p305 with outcome was detected; however, overall levels of anti-p305 were elevated compared to mothers during pregnancy in all groups studied. For anti-p133-Ro60, reactivity paralleled that of anti-p305. In the screen employing apoptotic cells, p133-Ro60, but not p305, significantly attenuated the binding of immunoglobulin G isolated from a mother whose child had CHB (42.1% reduced to 13.9%, absence/presence of p133-Ro60, respectively,
