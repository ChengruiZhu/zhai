 was found to be composed almost entirely of a sensitization period. If a latent period exists, it is too short to be detected by the methods used and is probably less than a second in duration. The length of the reaction time, therefore, was used as a measure of the radiant energy necessary at any intensity to elicit a response. 2. The length of the reaction time was found to vary randomly by a factor of seven under constant environmental and stimulating conditions. Determination of large numbers of reaction times on several anemones, grouped according to length, gave closely similar distributions resembling Poisson distributions. It was suggested that the variability may be caused by the same factor or mechanism in each individual. An experimental scheme was presented for determining the expected error and variation in statistical quantities when groups of ten observations are used. 3. The means of groups of reaction times determined at different intensities formed a hyperbolic relationship when plotted against intensity, suggesting that the animal obeys the Bunsen-Roscoe law of reciprocity. No marked changes were noted of per cent deviation from the mean or of randomness at different intensities. Stimulation of
