 Michx.), measured with the high pressure flow meter technique (HPFM), can significantly increase within 30 min following exposure to high irradiance. The present study investigated whether this increase could be explained by an increase in the cell-to-cell pathway and whether the response is linked to changes in the transcript level corresponding to aquaporin genes. Four cDNA sequences showing high similarity to members of the aquaporin gene family from other plant species were characterized from bur oak leaves and the expression levels of these cDNA sequences were examined in leaves by quantitative real-time PCR (QRT-PCR). No change was found in the relative transcript abundance corresponding to these four putative aquaporin genes in leaves with light-induced high hydraulic conductance (exposed to high irradiance) compared to leaves with low hydraulic conductance (exposed to low irradiance). However, in sun leaves that were exposed to different light levels prior to leaf collection (full sunlight, shade, and covered with aluminium foil for 16 h), the relative transcript levels of two of the putative aquaporin genes increased several-fold in shaded leaves compared to the sun-exposed or covered leaves. When the leaves were pressure-infiltrated with the apoplastic tracer dye trisodium 3-hydroxy-5,8,10-pyrenetrisulphonate (PTS
