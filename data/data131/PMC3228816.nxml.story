THO/TREX is an eukaryotic conserved complex, first identified in budding yeast, that acts at the interface between transcription and mRNP (ribonucleoprotein) export. In yeast, THO mutants show gene expression defects and a transcription-associated recombination phenotype. Despite the structural conservation of THO/TREX, it is unclear whether the functional relevance is the same in mammals, in which several reports have identified a role of THO/TREX separated from transcription. We have asked whether mammalian THO/TREX function is connected to transcription and whether this function is required to prevent R-loop formation and to maintain genome integrity. Our study reveals that depletion of human THO subunits, in particular THOC1/hHPR1, reduces transcription elongation, affects mRNA export, and increases genome instability associated with the accumulation of DNA breaks. This genome instability is R-loopâ€“dependent and is accompanied by an alteration of global replication patterns and an increase in recombination. We conclude that human THO/TREX prevents the formation of R-loops that can compromise genome integrity. This work, therefore, provides experimental evidence for a role of mRNP biogenesis factors and R loops in genome integrity in humans.
