FcGBP was normally found in intestinal and colonic epithelia, gallbladder, cystic duct, bronchus, submandibular gland, cervix uteri and in fluids secreted by these cells in humans, and was down-regulated during colon carcinogenesis. We found FcGBP gene expression was decreased in HNSCC tissues compared to surgical safety border tissues while TGF-β expression level increased in HNSCC tissues, and higher FcGBP expression level was correlated to longer OS time of HNSCC patients. FcGBP expression level was higher in HPV-positive HNSCC tissues compared to HPV-negative HNSCC tissues, while TGF-β expression level was lower in HPV-positive HNSCC tissues. Gene expression level of FcGBP and TGF-β was negatively correlated in HNSCC tissues. FcGBP expression level increased after HPV E6 overexpression in HPV-negative HNSCC cells, and TGF-β could inhibit the up-regulation of FcGBP after HPV E6 or FcGBP overexpression in HPV-negative HNSCC cells. The migration capability was inhibited after FcGBP overexpression, and TGF-β could counteract the inhibition of migration caused by FcGBP overexpression. FcGBP gene expression level was correlated to the expression levels of EMT markers. In conclusion, FCGBP expression was upregulated by HPV infection while inhibited by TGF-β, and was correlated to the prognosis of HNSCC patients.
