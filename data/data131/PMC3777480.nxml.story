The diagnosis of postradiation nasopharyngeal skull base lesions in petients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) is still a tough problem in clinical practice. An early and accurate diagnosis is important for subsequent management. We prospectively evaluated the diagnostic value of plasma Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) DNA in detecting postradiation nasopharyngeal skull base lesions in NPC patients. From July 2006 to September 2010, 90 patients with postradiation NPC (34 women and 56 men; median age: 42 years) met the selection criteria and were recruited in this study. All postradiation nasopharyngeal skull base lesions were found in the latest magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) examinations before endoscopic surgery, and the nasopharyngeal cavity was normal under flexible nasopharyngoscopy. Plasma EBV DNA detection was performed within 2 weeks before endoscopic surgery. A total of 90 endoscopic operations were successfully performed without any postoperative complications. Recurrences confirmed by postoperative pathology were found in 30 patients. The specificity, positive and negative predictive values of plasma EBV DNA detection were better than those of MRI. In addition, combining plasma EBV DNA detection with MRI improved the specificity and positive predictive values of MRI. Plasma EBV DNA detection followed by MRI would help to diagnose recurrence whereas MRI was unable. These results indicate that plasma EBV DNA is an effective and feasible biomarker for detecting postradiation nasopharyngeal skull base lesions in NPC patients.
