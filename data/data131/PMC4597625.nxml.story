In this study, different clinical evaluations of 39 patients, who were diagnosed both clinically and radiologically as lateral patellar hyperpression syndrome and who were treated with arthroscopic external capsular release by radiofrequency probe, were compared retrospectively. The patients were evaluated in two groups: Group I (external capsular release, N:19) and Group II (external capsular release + mechanical external compression, N:20). The mean age of the patients was 38.5 +/- 7.3 and 42.3 +/-7.8, in group I and group II, respectively. The female / male ratio and right / left ratio was 17/2 and 16/4, and 9/10 and 9/11 in group I and group II, respectively. Postoperative drainage, cold compression, postoperative 24 hours of bed rest was applied to all patients. In addition, knee range of motion together with quadriceps strengthening exercises was started after postoperative 24 hours in both groups. In group II, mechanical external lateral compression with a steril roll bandage was applied just lateral to the patella and it was ended after one week. The clinical evaluations of the patients were performed first with VAS scoring preoperatively, at 1st and 6th month postoperatively and second with measurements of intraarticular bleeding amounts within the postoperative drains. For the statistical evaluations of the data, variance analysis and independent t-test were used.
