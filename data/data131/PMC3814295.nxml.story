The replication checkpoint ensures a smooth duplication of the genome. It counteracts the replication stress, which can cause chromosome rearrangements as found in most tumours. Given the importance of dealing with perturbed replication, and since in tumours secondary mutations or epigenetic changes may hamper efficiency of the replication checkpoint, it is crucial to determine the mechanisms responding to replication perturbation upon checkpoint inactivation. Furthermore, it is highly relevant to understand how failure of these mechanisms correlates with chromosomal damage after replication perturbation. Here, we investigated pathways that, in checkpoint-deficient human cells, are involved in the handling of perturbed DNA replication forks, and we uncovered a previously unappreciated function of RAD52 and MUS81 in ensuring viability of cells, but at the expense of genome instability. We also demonstrated that checkpoint deficiency can trigger different mechanisms of recovery from replication arrest depending on the presence of RAD52 or MUS81, resulting in a poor survival and reduced genome instability or increased survival and chromosomal damage. Our work provides new clues about how human cells deal with replication stress, and how genome instability may arise in cancer cells.
