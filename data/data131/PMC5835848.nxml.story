Cluster of differentiation 59 (CD59) is a glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored protein. Cross-linking of CD59 with specific monoclonal antibodies can cause a series of intracellular signal transduction events. However, the underlying molecular mechanisms are poorly understood. Linker for activation of T-cells (LAT) is a crucial adaptor protein in T-cell signaling, and its phosphorylation and palmitoylation are essential for its localization and function. In a previous study by the present authors, it was demonstrated that CD59 may be responsible for LAT palmitoylation, thereby regulating T-cell signal transduction. The present study detected the co-localization of LAT and CD59 in lipid rafts by transfecting Jurkat cells with lentivirus vectors carrying the LAT-enhanced green fluorescent protein fusion protein. In addition, LAT and CD59 were shown to have a synergistic effect on the proliferation of Jurkat cells. The results also indicated that CD59 may transfer the palmitate group from phosphatidylinositol to LAT to form LAT palmitate, which then localizes to lipid rafts to regulate T-cell activation. The results of the present study provided novel insights into the role of CD59 in T-cell signal transduction.
