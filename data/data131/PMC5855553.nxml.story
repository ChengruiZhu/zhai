Oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (OPCs) constitute one of the main populations of dividing cells in the central nervous system (CNS). Physiologically, OPCs give rise to mature, myelinating oligodendrocytes and confer trophic support to their neighboring cells within the nervous tissue. OPCs are known to be extremely sensitive to the influence of exogenous clues which might affect their crucial biological processes, like survival, proliferation, differentiation, and the ability to generate a myelin membrane. Alterations in their differentiation influencing their final potential for myelinogenesis are usually the leading cause of CNS dys- and demyelination, contributing to the development of leukodystrophic disorders. The evaluation of the mechanisms that cause oligodendrocytes to malfunction requires detailed studies based on designed in vitro models. Since OPCs readily respond to changes in local homeostasis, it is crucial to establish restricted culture conditions to eliminate the potential stimuli that might influence oligodendrocyte biology. Additionally, the in vitro settings should mimic the physiological conditions to enable the obtained results to be translated to future preclinical studies. Therefore, the aim of our study was to investigate OPC differentiation in physiological normoxia (5% O
