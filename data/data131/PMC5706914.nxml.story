Adipose tissue is considered to be an endocrine organ, and adipocyte size correlates with insulin resistance and metabolic parameters in obesity. There is little data on the effects of angiopoietin-1 in adipose tissue and kidney in streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetes. In this study, we investigated the protective effect of COMP-angiopoietin-1 (COMP-Ang1), a potent variant of angiopoietin-1, on vascular endothelial cells in epididymal adipose tissue and its regulatory effect on other metabolic parameters, such as lipid droplet diameter, macrophage infiltration, and renal inflammation in STZ-treated mice. Our data showed that COMP-Ang1 increased the density of platelet endothelial cell adhesion molecule-1 (PECAM-1)-1-positive vascular endothelial cells in adipose tissue, which were significantly decreased by treatment with STZ. COMP-Ang1 ameliorated the STZâ€“induced decrease in lipid droplet diameter and increase in macrophage infiltration in adipose tissue. Serum free fatty acid and triglyceride levels were decreased after administration of COMP-Ang1. There was a beneficial effect on serum insulin levels after treatment with COMP-Ang1 in STZ-induced diabetic mice. Fasting blood glucose levels in COMP-Ang1-treated mice were significantly lower than those of LacZ-treated mice. Cotreatment with COMP-Ang1 and STZ also had similar effects on the above parameters. Administration of soluble Tie2, an inhibitor of angiopoietin-1, reversed the effects of COMP-Ang1. COMP-Ang1 was found to ameliorate the up-regulation of proinflammatory molecules and F4/80-positive macrophage infiltration in the kidneys of STZ-treated mice. COMP-Ang1 increased the phosphorylation of Akt in epididymal adipose tissue and kidneys of STZ-induced diabetic mice. These data indicate that COMP-Ang1 regulates lipogenic effects in adipose tissue and renal inflammation in STZ-induced diabetic mice.
