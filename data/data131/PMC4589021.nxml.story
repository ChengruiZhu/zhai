48 patients (53 hips) underwent arthroscopic revision FAI correction (mean 20.0 months follow-up). There were 62 previous arthroscopic surgeries and 4 previous surgical dislocations. There were 23 males and 25 females with a mean age of 29.9 years (range 18 - 59). 48 hips had residual cam-type FAI, and 40 hips had residual pincer-type FAI and underwent femoral and rim resections, respectively. The labrum was debrided in 27 hips, repaired in 24 hips and reconstructed with allograft in 2 hips. Adhesions were excised for 35 hips. The results of revision arthroscopic FAI correction were compared to 154 patients (169 hips) that underwent primary arthroscopic FAI correction (mean 25.2 months follow-up). The mean improvement for outcomes scores after revision FAI correction was 13.7 points (MHHS, p<.01), 8.6 points (SF-12, p<.01), and 2.6 points (VAS, p<.01) compared to 23.7 points (MHHS, p<.01), 22.3 points (SF-12, p<.01), and 4.6 points (VAS, p<.01) after primary arthroscopic FAI correction. Most recent outcomes scores and mean improvement in outcome scores were significantly better after primary (81% good/ excellent results) compared to revision (63.3% good/excellent results) FAI correction (MHS (p=.012), SF-12 (p<.01), VAS (p<.01).
