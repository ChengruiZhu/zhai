 cardiomyocytes during cardiac lineage differentiation of ES cells. An antagonist of EphB4, TNYL‐RAW peptides, that block the binding of EphB4 and ephrinB2, impaired cardiac lineage development in ES cells. Inhibition of EphB4–ephrinB2 signaling at different time points during ES cell differentiation demonstrated that the interaction of EphB4 and ephrinB2 was required for the early stage of cardiac lineage development. Forced expression of human full‐length EphB4 or intracellular domain‐truncated EphB4 in EphB4‐null ES cells was established to investigate the role of EphB4‐forward signaling in ES cells. Interestingly, while full‐length EphB4 was able to restore the cardiac lineage development in EphB4‐null ES cells, the truncated EphB4 that lacks the intracellular domain of tyrosine kinase and PDZ motif failed to rescue the defect of cardiomyocyte development, suggesting that EphB4 intracellular domain is essential for the development of cardiomyocytes. Our study provides evidence that receptor‐kinase‐dependent EphB4‐forward signaling plays a crucial role in the development of cardiac progenitor cells. J. Cell.
