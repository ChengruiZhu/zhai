Lipid mediators contribute to inflammation providing both pro-inflammatory signals and terminating the inflammatory process by activation of macrophages. Among the most significant biologically lipid mediators, these are produced by free-radical or enzymatic oxygenation of arachidonic acid named "eicosanoids". There were some novel eicosanoids identified within the last decade, and many of them are measurable in clinical samples by affordable chromatography-mass spectrometry equipment or sensitive immunoassays. In this review, we present some recent advances in understanding of the signaling by eicosanoid mediators during asthmatic airway inflammation. Eicosanoid profiling in the exhaled breath condensate, induced sputum, or their metabolites measurements in urine is complementary to the cellular phenotyping of asthmatic inflammation. Special attention is paid to aspirin-exacerbated respiratory disease, a phenotype of asthma manifested by the most profound changes in the profile of eicosanoids produced. A hallmark of this type of asthma with hypersensitivity to non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) is to increase biosynthesis of cysteinyl leukotrienes on the systemic level. It depends on transcellular biosynthesis of leukotriene C
