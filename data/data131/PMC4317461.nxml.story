One hundred eighty-five revised acetabular liners in two cohorts (annealed and sequentially annealed) were collected in a multicenter retrieval program between 2000 and 2013. We controlled for implantation time between the two cohorts by excluding annealed liners with a greater implantation time than the longest term sequentially annealed retrieval (5 years); the mean implantation time (± SD) for the annealed components was 2.2 ± 1.4 years, and for the sequentially annealed liners, it was 1.2 ± 1.2 years. Reasons for revision were assessed based on medical records, radiographs, and examinations of the retrieved components. Oxidation was measured at the bearing surface, the backside surface, the locking mechanism, and the rim using Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (ASTM F2102). Penetration was measured directly using a micrometer (accuracy: 0.001 mm). Mechanical behavior (ultimate load) was measured at the superior and inferior bearing surfaces using the small punch test (ASTM F2183). We used nonparametric statistical testing to analyze for differences in oxidation, penetration rates, and ultimate load when adjusting for HXLPE formulation as a function of implantation time.
