For data mining, reducing the unnecessary redundant attributes which was known as attribute reduction (AR), in particular, reducts with minimal cardinality, is an important preprocessing step. In the paper, by a coding method of combination subset of attributes set, a novel search strategy for minimal attribute reduction based on rough set theory (RST) and fish swarm algorithm (FSA) is proposed. The method identifies the core attributes by discernibility matrix firstly and all the subsets of noncore attribute sets with the same cardinality were encoded into integers as the individuals of FSA. Then, the evolutionary direction of the individual is limited to a certain extent by the coding method. The fitness function of an individual is defined based on the attribute dependency of RST, and FSA was used to find the optimal set of reducts. In each loop, if the maximum attribute dependency and the attribute dependency of condition attribute set are equal, then the algorithm terminates, otherwise adding a single attribute to the next loop. Some well-known datasets from UCI were selected to verify this method. The experimental results show that the proposed method searches the minimal attribute reduction set effectively and it has the excellent global search ability.
