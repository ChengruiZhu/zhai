 is occurrence of autophagy, an intracellular bulk degradation of damaged macromolecules and organelles that may restore cellular and tissue homoeostasis, improving chances for recovery. Nevertheless, depending on the type and intensity of stressors and inflammatory responses, autophagy may become pathological, resulting in excessive cell death. The present review examines the multilayered defences that cells have evolved to reduce proteotoxic stress by degradation of potentially toxic material beginning with endoplasmic reticulum‐associated degradation, and the unfolded protein response, which are mechanisms for removal from the endoplasmic reticulum of misfolded proteins, and then progressing through the stages of autophagy, including descriptions of autophagosomes and related vesicular structures which process material for degradation and autophagy‐associated proteins including Beclin‐1 and regulatory complexes. The physiological roles of each mode of proteotoxic defence will be examined along with consideration of how emerging understanding of autophagy, along with a newly discovered regulatory cell type called telocytes, may be used to augment existing strategies for the prevention and management of cardiovascular disease.
