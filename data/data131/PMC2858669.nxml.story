All proteins that move between the cytoplasm and the nucleus must pass through nuclear pore complexes, large aqueous channels around 40nm in diameter. In some cases the nuclear envelope is perforated with several thousand nuclear pore complexes, while in other cases they are few and far between. Macromolecular transport through nuclear pores is highly regulated; an elaborate system, involving the binding and unbinding of accessory proteins (transport receptors), allows regulation of which proteins can pass through the pores. The basic principles that govern this selective filtering are not fully understood. Some proteins pass through the pore without binding to transport receptors, while others require the binding of multiple transport receptors for efficient translocation. How does the pore select which proteins can pass through, and which cannot? This paper carries out a biophysical analysis of the properties of proteins that can translocate through the nuclear pore. We find that proteins capable of fast translocation are highly negatively charged, whereas proteins that cannot pass through the pore are positively charged. Moreover, proteins that constitute the interior of the pore channel itself are net positively charged. This suggests that electrostatic interactions between translocating proteins and the pore are an essential part of the selective filtering mechanism.
