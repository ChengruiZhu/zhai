, in endothelial cells results in an anti-inflammatory phenotype. We have investigated, at the individual cellular level, the senescent phenotype of endothelial cells following three of the chief signals associated with ageing; oxidative stress, disturbed flow and hypoxia. All three stimuli induce senescence and, based on neutrophil adhesion and expression of the adhesion molecules E-selectin and VCAM-1, a population of senescent cells is seen that is resistant to inflammatory stimuli and thus we define as anti-inflammatory. The proportion of anti-inflammatory cells increases with time but remains stable at approximately 50% by eight days after induction of senescence, suggesting that these are stable phenotypes of endothelial cell senescence. Similar to other senescent cell types, p38MAPK blockade inhibits the development of the pro-inflammatory phenotype but unique to EC, there is a corresponding increase in the number of anti-inflammatory senescent cells. Thus stress-induced senescent endothelial cells display a mosaic of inflammatory phenotypes. The anti-inflammatory population suggests that senescent endothelial cells may have an unique protective role, to inhibit uncontrolled proliferation and to limit the local inflammatory response.
