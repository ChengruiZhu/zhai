An en face, medium energy electron boost of approximately 10 Gy is often given to stomal and peristomal tissues. Because the boost is considered a simple treatment, CT‐based treatment planning is rarely used. Further, the results of such a plan might be inaccurate, as the complex dose distribution surrounding the stoma air cavity is poorly modeled by many treatment planning systems. We constructed three phantoms—two with a central vertical cavity to mimic the size and shape of the stoma and proximal trachea and one with a cavity inclined at 45° to the horizontal to better simulate anatomy. These were used to investigate the dose distribution surrounding the stoma. In all cases, the entrance to the stoma opening was centered in a field defined by a 7‐cm circular cutout and the phantom was irradiated at a source‐surface distance (SSD) of 100 cm with either vertically incident 9‐ or 12‐MeV electrons. Film measurements were made at a range of depths below and lateral to the cavity. For the vertical cavity phantoms, diode measurements were performed and isodose plans using CT scans of the phantoms were generated on a modern treatment planning system. For these two phantoms, the combined effects of lateral scatter from surrounding material and reduced equivalent thickness for electrons which pass directly through the cavity increases the dose within a centimeter of the bottom of cavity by as much as 50% for 9 MeV and 70% for 12 MeV. In material at the shallower (“superior”) end of the inclined cavity, a
