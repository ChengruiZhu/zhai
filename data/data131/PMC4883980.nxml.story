In the past decade, the traditional view of cancers as a homogeneous collection of malignant cells is being replaced by a model of ever increasing complexity suggesting that cancers are complex tissues composed of multiple cell types. This complex model of tumorigenesis has been well supported by a growing body of evidence indicating that most cancers including those derived from blood and solid tissues display a hierarchical organization of tumor cells with phenotypic and functional heterogeneity and at the apex of this hierarchy are cells capable of self-renewal. These “tumor imitating cells” or “cancer stem cells” drive tumorigenesis and contribute to metastasis, treatment resistance and tumor relapse. Although tumor stem cells themselves may display both genetic and phenotypic heterogeneity, recent studies have demonstrated that cancer stem cells maintain plasticity to transition between mesenchymal-like (EMT) and epithelial-like (MET) states, which may be regulated by the tumor microenvironment. These stem cell state transitions may play a fundamental role in tumor progression and treatment resistance. In this review, we discuss the emerging knowledge regarding the plasticity of cancer stem cells with an emphasis on the signaling pathways and noncoding RNAs including microRNAs (miRNA) and long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) in regulation of this plasticity during tumor growth and metastasis. Lastly, we point out the importance of targeting both the EMT and MET states of CSCs in order to eliminate these lethal seeds of cancers.
