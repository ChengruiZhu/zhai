 The fine structure of the visual and the supporting cells and of the blood capillaries in the octopus retina is described. Lamellated structures contained in the proximal segment of the visual cell consist of compact arrays of dense membranes each of which is quintuple-layered and divides at its margins into two thinner sheets or membranes which are connected directly with the agranular or granular endoplasmic reticulum. Proximal to the deeper extremities of the rhabdomeres, the lateral plasma membranes of two adjoining visual cells contact each other forming a quintuple-layered compound membrane, which results in occlusion of the intercellular space. The central layer of the compound membrane is of high density, so that the membrane, as a whole, appears to be a single thick layer at low magnifications. The supporting cells are connected with the neighboring visual cells by two types of junctions. Long slender processes extend from the supporting cells to the surface of the retina through narrow spaces among the distal segments of the visual cells. The capillary endothelial cells are characterized by luminal surfaces irregularly contoured and by lateral surfaces elaborately interdigitated. The functional significance of the close contact between adjoining visual cells is discussed.
