In Portugal, the health care system presents weaknesses resulting from a remarkable diversity of entry points, inadequate use of scarce and expensive resources and difficult information flow between institutions and professionals. The social care network is mostly run by privately owned, non-profit-making institutions (IPSS and Misericórdias), that operate close to the populations. In 2006, the Portuguese government has created the National Network of Continuous Integrated Care (RNCCI) that has been presented as a third level of care, connecting with acute care hospitals and health centres. The network is based on establishing protocols with existing institutions (many of them IPSS or hospitals belonging to Misericórdias). Home care is supposed to be one important element in this network, but implementation only now has started. Integration outside the RNCCI (e.g. between hospitals and primary care) and between the RNCCI and other levels of care is still weak. In this context, researching and evaluating the interfaces among the entities that populate the networks is of fundamental importance. Surprisingly, this is one of the less focused aspects in integrated care research. Some indicators have been used, but they are manifestly insufficient. Above all, they represent disentangled attempts to monitor individual services responsiveness in the absence of a robust methodology, designed to provide a more holistic perspective of performance and self-improving capabilities. In this study we present the preliminary results of a study designed to assess the quality of care transition and network activation action, from the patient’s perspective.
