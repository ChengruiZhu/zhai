Glioblastomas (GBMs) are the most prevalent and devastating primary intracranial malignancies and have extensive heterogeneity. Notch1 signaling is a more complex process in the development of numerous cell and tissue types, including gliomagenesis and progression, and is upregulated in glioma-initiating cells. However, the contradictory expression of Notch1 among lower grade gliomas and GBMs confounds our understanding of GBM biology and has made identifying effective therapies difficult. In this study, we validated that Notch1 and NF-κB(p65) are highly expressed in the classical and proneural subtypes of GBM using the data set from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and the Chinese Glioma Genome Atlas (CGGA). DAPT and shRNA targeting Notch1 decreased NF-κB(p65) expression, suppressed cell proliferation, and induced apoptosis of GBM cells in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, we illustrated that the intracellular Notch could bind with NF-κB(p65) in GBM cells. These findings suggest that the cross-talk between Notch1 signaling and NF-κB(p65) could contribute to the proliferation and apoptosis of glioma, and this discovery could help drive the design of more effective therapies in Notch1-targeted clinical trials.
