-ATPase inhibitor thasigargin (Tg) responses to the maximal ATP concentration (100 Î¼M) in THP-1 monocytes, and responses in macrophage were significantly attenuated. Tg-resistant ATP-evoked calcium responses in the model macrophage were dependent on extracellular calcium, suggesting a requirement for calcium influx. Ivermectin (IVM) potentiated the magnitude of Tg-resistant component and slowed the decay of response in the model macrophage. The Tg-resistant component was attenuated by P2X4 antagonists 5-BDBD and PSB-12062 but not by the P2X1 antagonist Ro0437626 or the P2X7 antagonist A438079. shRNA-mediated P2X4 knockdown resulted in a significant reduction in Tg-resistant ATP-evoked calcium response as well as reduced sensitivities towards P2X4-specific pharmacological tools, IVM and PSB-12062. Inhibition of endocytosis with dynasore significantly reduced the magnitude of Tg-resistant component but substantially slowed decay response. Inhibition of calcium-dependent exocytosis with vacuolin-1 had no effect on the Tg-resistant component. These pharmacological data suggest that P2X4 receptor activation contributed significantly towards the ionotropic calcium response evoked by ATP of the model human macrophage.
