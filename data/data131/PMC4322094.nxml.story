., chikungunya, are spreading globally, as are important mosquito vectors. In the absence of approved vaccines, therapeutant or prophylaxis, vector control remains the only means to combat multiple mosquito-borne pathogens. Auto-dissemination strategies have attracted attention as a method to reduce mosquito populations and benefit from mosquito behavior, in which a female mosquito visits multiple breeding sites. As practiced currently, ‘dissemination stations’ are attractive to adult females, which enter the station, become contaminated with a juvenile hormone analogue (JHA), exit and then contaminate breeding sites with levels of JHA that are lethal to immature mosquitoes. The auto-dissemination method is particularly attractive for those species that breed within small, cryptic sites, which serve as refugia from existing insecticidal measures. Here we examine mathematically and empirically, a novel approach that is not station-based, but which integrates elements of autocidal control. Specifically, the approach would release JHA-contaminated adult male mosquitoes, which do not bite or transmit pathogens. The males deliver JHA to breeding sites, either directly or indirectly,
