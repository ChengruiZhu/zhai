Several observations have led us to a new hypothesis for cancer mechanism. First, that cancer appears only on those multicellular organisms with complicated wound-healing capacities. Second, that wounds considered as risk factors can be identified in all cancers in clinics. And finally, that oncogene activation appears not only in cancer, but also in normal physiology and noncancer pathology processes. Our proposed hypothesis is that cancer is a natural wound healing-related process, which includes oncogene activations, cytokine secretions, stem cell recruitment differentiation, and tissue remodeling. Wounds activate oncogenes of some cells and the latter secrete cytokines to recruit stem cells to heal the wounds. However, if the cause of the wound or if the wound persists, such as under the persistent UV and carcinogen exposures, the continuous wound healing process will lead to a clinical cancer mass. There is no system in nature to stop or reverse the wound healing process in the middle stage when the wound exists. The outcome of the cancer mechanism is either healing the wound or exhausting the whole system (death). The logic of this cancer mechanism is consistent with the rationales of the other physiological metabolisms in the bodyâ€”for survival. This hypothesis helps to understand many cancer mysteries derived from the mutation theory, such as why cancer only exists in a small proportion of multicellular organisms, although they are all under potential mutation risks during DNA replications. The hypothesis can be used to interpret and guide cancer prevention, recurrence, metastasis,
