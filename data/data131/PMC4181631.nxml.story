The semaphorins, discovered over 20 years ago, are a large family of secreted or transmembrane and glycophosphatidylinositol -anchored proteins initially identified as axon guidance molecules crucial for the development of the nervous system. It has now been established that they also play important roles in organ development and function, especially involving the immune, respiratory, and cardiovascular systems, and in pathological disorders, including cancer. During tumor progression, semaphorins can have both pro- and anti-tumor functions, and this has created complexities in our understanding of these systems. Semaphorins may affect tumor growth and metastases by directly targeting tumor cells, as well as indirectly by interacting with and influencing cells from the micro-environment and vasculature. Mechanistically, semaphorins, through binding to their receptors, neuropilins and plexins, affect pathways involved in cell adhesion, migration, invasion, proliferation, and survival. Importantly, neuropilins also act as co-receptors for several growth factors and enhance their signaling activities, while class 3 semaphorins may interfere with this. In this review, we focus on the secreted class 3 semaphorins and their neuropilin co-receptors in cancer, including aspects of their signaling that may be clinically relevant.
