Survivin is essential to angiogenesis and revascularization, but its role in coronary collateral formation remains unclear. The role of survivin in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of coronary chronic total occlusion (CTO) patients was investigated. Coronary CTO patients (n=46; mean age 60.1±8.5, male 54.3%) (CTO group) and normal control patients (n=18; mean age 58.0±10.0, male 55.6%) underwent angiographic collateral vessel grading by Rentrop classification (C0 – C3) and provided peripheral blood between June 2006 and February 2007. Rat hind limb ischemia models were constructed using four equal groups of Sprague-Dawley rats (n=36): normal control, sham operation, operation and granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF). PBMC numbers and characteristics, collateral vessels, survivin, CD4, CD8, CD44, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) expression were determined using RT-PCR, flow cytometry, immunocytochemistry and western blot analysis. PBMC survivin mRNA and protein expression levels were higher in patients with good collateral circulation (C2 + C3) than in patients with no collateral flow (C0) (all P<0.05). Survivin single-positive and survivin and CD8, VEGF and ICAM-1 double-positive percentages were elevated in patients with good collateral circulation compared to those with normal and no collateral flow (all P<0.05), consistent with the rat model results, wherein higher survivin levels produced significantly larger and more visible collateral vessels. In conclusion, elevated survivin expression in PBMCs, particularly survivin and CD8, VEGF, and ICAM-1 double-positive PBMCs, may be crucial for good collateral formation in patients with coronary CTO, as confirmed by assessment of a rat model.
