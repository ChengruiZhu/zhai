Metformin is one of the oldest and most widely prescribed antidiabetic medicines worldwide. It is the only such medicine that has shown a reduction of cardiovascular mortality in diabetes mellitus type 2. Since many diabetic patients have chronic kidney disease, its use is often curtailed by practitioners due to fear of lactic acidosis and the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) warnings that, until recently, had been in place for decades. Current guidelines, though somewhat vague regarding dosages, clearly pave the way for spreading the use of metformin in patients with lower glomerular filtration rates. These guidelines also suggest moving away from just looking at serum creatinine to create a cut-off. Metforminâ€™s costs are lower, and in many underdeveloped countries this is the only medicine available for poor patients. More widespread use of metformin will further help with health care costs, as well as obesity. It will simplify the use of diabetes mellitus type 2 management with lower incidences of hypoglycemia. With all the mounting evidence, the FDA is finally requiring labeling changes regarding recommendations, to allow the use of metformin in patients with much reduced kidney function.
