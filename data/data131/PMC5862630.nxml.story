The combined value of RDW and GRACE risk score for cardiovascular prognosis in ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) undergoing primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) has not been fully investigated. This study was designed to explore the combined value of RDW and GRACE risk score on predicting long-term major adverse cardiac event (Mace) in STEMI patients undergoing primary PCI. This study included 390 STEMI patients. The primary endpoint at the (33.5 ± 7.1) months follow-up was composed of cardiac death and nonfatal myocardial infarction. The relationship between clinical parameters and clinical outcomes was evaluated using Cox regression model and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis. Mace occurred in 126 (32.3%) patients including 54 (13.8%) cardiac deaths and 72 (18.5%) nonfatal myocardial infarctions. Patients in Mace group had significantly higher RDW and GRACE score than the patients in non-Mace group. According to the Cox model, RDW and GRACE score were the most important independent predictors of Mace and cardiac death. The best cut-off value for RDW to predict the occurrence of primary events was 13.25% (AUC = 0.694, 95% CI:0.639–0.750,
