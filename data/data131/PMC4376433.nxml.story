 and several other tumor-related genes indicated that the Sall2 regulation of these promoters was not significantly different between the two major forms of Sall2 with alternative exon 1 or exon 1A. Additional analysis showed that Sall2-induced p16 promoter activation was Sall2 dose-dependent. Deletion and site-directed mutagenesis of the p16 promoter identified a consensus Sall2 binding site (GGGTGGG) proximal to the p16 transcription start site and was critical for p16 promoter activation. Finally, to confirm the significance of Sall2-activated p16 expression in cell cycle regulation, we co-transfected the SKOV3 cells with a Sall2 expression construct and a p16 minigene and also co-transfected the ES-2 cells with a Sall2 expression construct and the siRNA against p16 for flow cytometry analysis. Our results showed that Sall2 enhanced the p16 minigene blocking of cell cycle progression and p16 knockdown with siRNA abolished most of the Sall2 inhibition of cell cycle progression. These findings indicate that Sall2 targets multiple cell cycle regulators, including p16, through their promoters, adding knowledge to the understanding of Sall2 and p16 gene regulation, and how Sall2 deregulation may promote cancer formation.
