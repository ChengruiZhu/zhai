Minimally-invasive procedures for parathyroidectomy have revolutionized the surgical treatment of primary hyperparathyroidism (pHPT). Coexistence of goitre is considered a major contraindication for these approaches, especially if unilateral. A specific advantage of video-assisted parathyroidectomy (VAP) compared to other endoscopic techniques is the possibility to combine it with thyroidectomy when necessary and when the selection criteria for video-assisted thyroidectomy (VAT) are met. We evaluated the role of VAP in a region with a high prevalence of goitre. The medical records of all patients who underwent parathyroidectomy and concomitant thyroid resection in our Division, between May 1998 and June 2012, were reviewed. Patients who underwent VAP and concomitant VAT were included in this study. Overall, in this period, 615 patients were treated in our Division for pHPT and 227 patients (36.9%) underwent concomitant thyroid resection. Among these, 384 patients were selected for VAP and 124 (32.3%) underwent concomitant VAT (lobectomy in 26 cases, total thyroidectomy in 98). No conversion to conventional surgery was registered. Mean operative time was 66.6 Â± 43.6 min. Transient hypocalcaemia was observed in 42 cases. A transient recurrent nerve lesion was registered in one case. No other complications occurred. Final histology showed parathyroid adenoma in all but two cases of parathyroid carcinoma, benign goitre in 119 cases and papillary thyroid carcinoma in the remaining 5 patients. After a mean follow-up of 33.2 months, no persistent or recurrent disease was observed. In our experience, a video-assisted approach for the treatment of synchronous thyroid and parathyroid diseases is feasible, effective and safe at least considering short-term follow-up.
