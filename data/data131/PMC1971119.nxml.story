It is well known that many genetic mutations in oncogenes or tumor suppressors can cause or greatly increase a person's susceptibility to cancer. It is generally assumed that persons should feel relieved if they have not inherited the particular “cancer-causing” mutation carried by their parents. However, we found that, under certain circumstances, fruit flies carrying tumor suppressor gene mutations can pass the increased tumor risk to all offspring, even those that have not inherited the particular mutation. A likely scenario is that many genetic mutations can lead to epigenetic alterations, that is, changes in the chemical modifications of DNA or the proteins that bind to DNA in the chromosomes, and these changes can have global effects on cell function. Normally, these epigenetic alterations are wiped out and reset in the early embryo, but under certain circumstances such alterations can be inherited. Interestingly, we found evidence that a particular oncoprotein, an overactivated form of a cell-signaling molecule called JAK kinase, can counteract the epigenetic resetting program that normally operates in the early embryo. Thus, the failure of epigenetic reprogramming allows the inheritance of parental epigenetic alterations that affect susceptibility to tumors.
