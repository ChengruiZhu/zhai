Antinuclear autoantibodies (ANAs) displaying the nuclear dense fine speckled immunofluorescence (DFS-IIF) pattern in HEp-2 substrates are commonly observed in clinical laboratory referrals. They target the dense fine speckled autoantigen of 70 kD (DFS70), most commonly known as lens epithelium-derived growth factor p75 (LEDGFp75). Interesting features of these ANAs include their low frequency in patients with systemic autoimmune rheumatic diseases (SARD), elevated prevalence in apparently healthy individuals, IgG isotype, strong trend to occur as the only ANA specificity in serum, and occurrence in moderate to high titers. These autoantibodies have also been detected at varied frequencies in patients with diverse non-SARD inflammatory and malignant conditions such as atopic diseases, asthma, eye diseases, and prostate cancer. These observations have recently stimulated vigorous research on their clinical and biological significance. Some studies have suggested that they are natural, protective antibodies that could serve as biomarkers to exclude a SARD diagnosis. Other studies suggest that they might be pathogenic in certain contexts. The emerging role of DFS70/LEDGFp75 as a stress protein relevant to human acquired immunodeficiency syndrome, cancer, and inflammation also points to the possibility that these autoantibodies could be sensors of cellular stress and inflammation associated with environmental factors. In this comprehensive review, we integrate our current knowledge of the biology of DFS70/LEDGFp75 with the clinical understanding of its autoantibodies in the contexts of health and disease.
