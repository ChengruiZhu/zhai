Whether comparing morphology or cognitive ability, it is clear that the human brain has evolved rapidly relative to that of other primates. But the extent to which genes expressed in the brain also reflect this overall pattern is unclear. To address this question, it's necessary to measure any variations in the DNA sequences of these genes between human and chimpanzee. And, to do this as accurately as possible, it's also important to require an appropriate reference group to act as a benchmark against which the differences can be measured. We therefore compared publicly available genomic sequences of chimps and humans with complementary DNA sequences of several thousand genes expressed in the brain of another closely related primate—the macaque, an Old World monkey—as well as the more distantly related mouse. Our analyses of the rates of protein evolution in these species suggest that genes expressed in the human brain have in fact slowed down in their evolution since the split between human and chimpanzee, contrary to some previously published reports. We suggest that advanced brains are driven primarily by the increasing complexity in the network of gene interactions. As a result, brain-expressed genes are constrained in their sequence evolution, although their expression levels may change rapidly.
