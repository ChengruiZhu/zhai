Rod shaped fission yeast cells, as the name suggests, divide by medial fission. The proper timing of this cytokinesis and septation event is controlled by a signaling pathway called the Septum Initiation Network, or SIN. The SIN is activated only after chromosomes start to separate in anaphase. At this stage, the two daughter spindle pole bodies (SPBs - the yeast analog of centrosomes) have separated and are on their way to the distant tips of the cell. SIN components are localized to SPBs, but the SIN is active only at one SPB, while the Cdc16-Byr4 complex keeps the SIN inactive at the other SPB. This asymmetric activation of the SIN is important for proper cell division as perturbation of this can lead to appearance of multiple septa or total lack of septation. The molecular mechanisms that are important for asymmetry establishment are emerging, but we lack a complete picture. Here we develop computational models to capture the dynamical features of asymmetry establishment and to determine the key components and interactions that are needed for proper asymmetric SIN activation. Our predictions and their experimental tests reveal some basic features of the system and highlight missing points in our knowledge.
