Hibernating species significantly reduce energy expenditure during winter by entering torpor. Nevertheless, the various benefits of hibernation might be counteracted by negative effects of torpor such as immune depression, oxidative stress, or neuronal impairment. Considering these trade-offs, adequate energy reserves could allow animals to reduce the time spent in torpor or the extent of metabolic depression. Common hamsters use food stores during hibernation and previously documented high individual variations in body temperature patterns during winter could, therefore, be related to differences in external energy reserves. In this study, we manipulated the availability of food stores under laboratory conditions to investigate potential effects on hibernation patterns. Female hamsters were kept in artificial burrows in climate chambers and subcutaneous temperature was recorded using implanted data loggers. One group had access to large food stores, whereas another group received daily food portions which were removed on the next day if not consumed. Almost all hamsters without access to food stores hibernated, while less than half of the individuals with food stores entered deep torpor. Individuals without food hoards additionally expressed more short torpor bouts and exhibited lower minimum subcutaneous temperatures during torpor than those with food stores. Thus, individuals confronted with lacking food reserves were more likely to hibernate and additionally saved energy by entering short torpor bouts more frequently and remaining at lower subcutaneous temperature both during torpor and euthermic periods. In conclusion, our results demonstrate that food store availability affects torpor expression and also highlight variation in torpor patterns and energy-saving strategies in common hamsters.
