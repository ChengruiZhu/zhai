The aim of this study is to present a reliable computational scheme to serve in pulse wave velocity (PWV) assessment in large arteries. Clinicians considered it as an indication of human blood vessels' stiffness. The simulation of PWV was conducted using a 3D elastic tube representing an artery. The constitutive material model specific for vascular applications was applied to the tube material. The fluid was defined with an equation of state representing the blood material. The onset of a velocity pulse was applied at the tube inlet to produce wave propagation. The Coupled Eulerian-Lagrangian (CEL) modeling technique with fluid structure interaction (FSI) was implemented. The scaling of sound speed and its effect on results and computing time is discussed and concluded that a value of 60â€‰m/s was suitable for simulating vascular biomechanical problems. Two methods were used: foot-to-foot measurement of velocity waveforms and slope of the regression line of the wall radial deflection wave peaks throughout a contour plot. Both methods showed coincident results. Results were approximately 6% less than those calculated from the Moens-Korteweg equation. The proposed method was able to describe the increase in the stiffness of the walls of large human arteries via the PWV estimates.
