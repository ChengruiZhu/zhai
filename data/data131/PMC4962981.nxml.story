All living cells define their boundaries by lipid-containing membranes, which are impermeable to ions and water-soluble metabolic intermediates, and thus allow maintaining constant conditions inside the cells and stopping metabolic intermediates from diffusing away. Membranes are formed by amphiphilic lipids that have a hydrophilic and a hydrophobic component. Such lipids form flat double-layered sheets (bilayers) wherein the hydrophilic components of the constituent lipids are directed towards the aqueous surroundings, the hydrophobic ones populate the center of the bilayer. Membranes grow when enzymes resident in the bilayer synthesize new amphiphilic lipids. These enzymes have their active site on one side of the membrane and insert the newly made lipids in only one of the two layers. To ensure symmetric growth of membranes, cells need flippases catalyzing the transfer of lipids from one into the other layer. To identify unknown flippases we performed a chemogenetic interaction screen able to bring to light functions of unknown proteins through their genetic interaction with genes of known function. The data point to Flc proteins as potential lipid flippases of the endoplasmic reticulum, reveal novel lipid modifying activities of Cst26 and Cwh43 and suggest that undeclared suppressor mutations in certain chromosomal regions can generate false genetic interactions.
