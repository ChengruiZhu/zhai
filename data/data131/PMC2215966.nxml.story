Intracellular pH (pHi) was measured with a pH-sensitive microelectrode in voltage-clamped sheep cardiac Purkinje fibers while tension was simultaneously measured. All solutions were nominally CO2/HCO3 free and were buffered with Tris. The addition of NH4Cl (5-20 mM) produced an initial intracellular alkalosis that was associated with an increase of twitch tension. At the same time, a component of voltage-dependent tonic tension developed. Prolonged exposure (greater than 5 min) to NH4Cl resulted in a slow recovery of pHi accompanied by a decrease of tension. Removal of NH4Cl produced a transient acidosis that was accompanied by a fall of force. In some experiments, there was then a transient recovery of force. If extracellular pH (pHo) was decreased, then pHi decreased slowly. Tension also fell slowly. An increase of pHo produced a corresponding increase of both force and pHi. The application of strophanthidin (10 microM) increased force and produced an intracellular acidosis. The addition of NH4Cl, to remove this acidosis partially, produced a significant increase of force. The above results show that contraction is sensitive to changes of intracellular but not extracellular pH. This pH dependence will therefore modify the contractile response to inotropic maneuvers that also affect pHi.
