In human cancers, miRNAs are important regulators of multiple cellular processes, and aberrant miRNA expression has been observed, and their alterations contribute to multiple cancer development and progression. Till now, little has been known about the role of miR-204 in human glioblastoma (GBM). In the present study, we used in-vitro assays to investigate the mechanisms of miR-204 in GBM cell lines and 60 cases of GBM tissues. Here, we found that miR-204 expression is downregulated in both GBM cell lines A172, U87 and U251 cells and GBM tissues as compared with NHA cells and normal tissues (all p<0.001). In addition, the ectopic expression of miR-204 suppressed A172 and U87 cell proliferation, migration and invasion. Meanwhile, miR-204 over-expression extremely inhibited the protein expression of ATF2. Notably, the enforced expression of ATF2 in A172 and U87 cells with the over-expression of miR-204 attenuated the inhibitory effects of miR-204 on proliferation, migration and invasion. In conclusion, our findings suggest that miR-204 suppressed cell proliferation, migration and invasion through inhibition of ATF2, thus, miR-204 may function as a useful drug target in the treatment and diagnosis of GBM.
