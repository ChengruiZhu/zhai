Worldwide, 5% of all cancers are associated with the sexually transmitted human papillomavirus (HPV). The most common cancer types attributed to HPV are cervical and anal cancers, but HPV-related head and neck cancers are on the rise, too. Even though the lifetime risk of infection with HPV is as high as 80%, most infections clear spontaneously within 1â€“2 years, and only a small fraction progress to cancer. In order to identify who is at risk for HPV-related cancer, a better understanding of the underlying biology is of great importance. While it is generally accepted that the immune system plays a key role in HPV clearance, we investigate here a mechanism which could be equally important: the stochastic division dynamics of stem cells in the infected tissues. Combining mechanistic mathematical models at the cell-level with population-level data, we disentangle the contributions from immune system and cellular dynamics in the clearance process. We find that cellular stochasticity may play an even more important role than the immune system. Our findings shed new light onto open questions in HPV immunobiology, and may influence the way we vaccinate and screen individuals at risk of HPV-related cancers.
