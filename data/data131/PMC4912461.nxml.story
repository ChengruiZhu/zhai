We studied the relationships between blood pressure (BP), pulse pressure (PP), and cardiovascular (CV) death in older adults using data from 2346 participants enrolled in the Costa Rican CRELES study, mean age 76 years (SD 10.2), 31% qualified as wide PP. All covariates included and analyzed were collected prospectively as part of a 4 year home-based follow-up; mortality was tracked for an additional three years, identifying 266 CV deaths. Longitudinal data revealed little change over time in systolic BP, a decline in diastolic BP, and widening of PP. Wide PP was associated with higher risk of CV death but only among individuals receiving antihypertensive drug therapy. Individuals with both wide PP and receiving therapy had 2.6 hazard rate (HR) of CV death relative to people with normal PP plus not taking treatment, even adjusting for systolic BP. Increasing PP between visits was significantly associated to higher CV death independently of treatment status. Systolic and diastolic BP were not significantly associated to CV death when the effect of PP was controlled for. Conclusion: elderly hypertensive patients with wide or increasing PP, especially if receiving treatment, are the highest CV risk group, thus must be carefully assessed, monitored, and treated with caution.
