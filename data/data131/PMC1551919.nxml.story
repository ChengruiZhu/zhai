The researchers studied the metabolic state of 82 patients with schizophrenia and 70 healthy controls by studying the levels of different molecules present in their cerebrospinal fluid (the clear body fluid that surrounds the brain and the spinal cord). Of the patients, 54 had just been diagnosed with schizophrenia (or a similar illness called brief psychotic disorder) and had not yet taken any medications to treat schizophrenia (so-called antipsychotic medication). The remaining patients were undergoing treatment with a range of antipsychotic drugs. The researchers found different levels of certain molecules in the spinal fluid of newly diagnosed patients who had never taken schizophrenia drugs compared with healthy individuals of the same ages. These molecules might therefore turn out to be useful biomarkers for schizophrenia. The differences between patients and controls suggested that the metabolism of several substances—including glucose and acetate—might be altered in the brains of patients with schizophrenia or brief psychotic disorder. The researchers also found that the levels of these molecules in some of the patients with newly diagnosed schizophrenia who were given medication became similar to the levels in the control individuals.
