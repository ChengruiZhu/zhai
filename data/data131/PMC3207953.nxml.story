Underdominance is a component of natural evolution: homozygotes – of either wildtypes or mutants – are advantageous. This can play a role in speciation and as a method to establish artificial genetic constructs in wild populations. The polymorphic state of wildtype and mutant alleles is unstable. However, in subdivided populations limited gene flow can counterbalance this effect. The maintenance of polymorphism sensitively depends on the amount of gene flow. In populations of finite size, the polymorphism is ultimately lost due to stochastic fluctuations, but there are long intermediate periods of polymorphism persistence. We analyze a simple population genetic model to characterize and explore the polymorphic phases depending on population size and genotypic fitness values. Even for large fluctuations (small population size), long periods of neither extinction nor fixation are possible. Since underdominance has been proposed as a genetic strategy in the pest management of disease vectors, it is important to understand the basic features of this system precisely, especially with a focus on gene flow between ecological patches. We assess different release strategies of potentially underdominant mutants, where one seeks to minimize the probability of fixation of the introduced allele but maximize the time to its extinction.
