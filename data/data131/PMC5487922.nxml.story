Gastric carcinoma is one of the most common malignancies worldwide and the second most frequent cause of cancer‐related death in China. Protein regulator of cytokinesis 1 (PRC1) is involved in cytokinesis and plays key roles in microtubule organization in eukaryotes. This study was aimed to analyse the expression and to investigate the functional role of PRC1 in gastric tumorigenesis. The expression of PRC1 was evaluated by qRT‐PCR, Western blot and immunohistochemistry. The biological function of PRC1 was determined by CCK‐8 proliferation assays, monolayer colony formation, xenografted nude mice and cell invasion assays by shRNA‐mediated knockdown in AGS and HGC27 cells. The regulation of PRC1 expression by piperlongumine was also investigated using dual‐luciferase reporter assay and ChIP‐qPCR analysis. PRC1 was up‐regulated in primary gastric cancers. Overexpression of PRC1 in gastric cancers was associated with poor disease‐specific survival and overall survival. PRC1 knockdown in AGS and HGC27 cell lines suppressed proliferation, reduced monolayer colony formation, inhibited cell invasion and migration ability and induced cell‐cycle arrest and apoptosis. Inhibition of PRC1 also suppressed tumour growth
