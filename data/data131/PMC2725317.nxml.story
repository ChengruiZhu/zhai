A central issue in biology is how local processes yield global consequences. This is especially relevant for neurons since these spatially extended cells process local synaptic inputs to generate global action potential output. The dendritic tree of a neuron, which receives most of the inputs, expresses ion channels that can generate nonlinear dynamics. A prominent phenomenon resulting from such ion channels are voltage oscillations. The distribution of the active membrane channels throughout the cell is often highly non-uniform. This can turn the dendritic tree into a network of sparsely spaced local oscillators. Here we analyze whether local dendritic oscillators can produce cell-wide voltage oscillations. Our mathematical theory shows that indeed even when the dendritic oscillators are weakly coupled, they lock their phases and give global oscillations. We show how the biophysical properties of the dendrites determine the global locking and how it can be controlled by synaptic inputs. As a consequence of global locking, even individual synaptic inputs can affect the timing of action potentials. In fact, dendrites locking in synchrony can lead to sustained firing of the cell. We show that dendritic trees can be bistable, with dendrites locking in either synchrony or asynchrony, which may provide a novel mechanism for single cell-based memory.
