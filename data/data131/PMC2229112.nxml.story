The enzymes cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) and protein kinase C (PKC) regulate the activity of cardiac ion channel proteins. In this study the whole-cell arrangement of the patch clamp technique was used to examine the effect of NaI on PKA-stimulated Cl- and Ca2+ channels in isolated guinea pig ventricular myocytes. Cl- currents (ICl) activated either by the beta-adrenergic agonist isoproterenol or the membrane- soluble cAMP analogue, 8-chlorphenylthio (8-CPT) cAMP, were greatly reduced in amplitude after substitution of an external solution containing 140 mM NaCl with a solution containing 140 mM NaI. This reduction was accompanied by a shift of -7 mV in the reversal potential (Erev) for ICl and could be reversed upon return to the NaCl external solution. Inhibition of ICl by NaI occurred in a concentration- dependent manner and was more pronounced for inward ICl (IC50 = 19 mM at -60 mV) than for outward ICl (IC50 = 60 mM at +60 mV). In contrast to ICl activated by PKA, ICl activated by PKC was slightly augmented in the presence of NaI and the Erev was found to shift by -15 mV. Based on these data, the relative permeability of I- to Cl- (PI/PCl) for this channel was calculated to be 1.79. NaI produced no change in the amplitude of inward calcium currents (ICa) recorded under basal conditions, but strongly inhibited ICa augmented by isoproterenol and 8- CPT cAMP, and during dialysis of cells with the catalytic subunit of PKA (CS). The in vitro incorporation of [gamma-32P]ATP into histone IIA and Kemptide, measured in the presence of PKA and cAMP, was not significantly different in assay mixtures containing salts of Cl- and I- . However, the ability of isoproterenol to augment basal ICa in whole- cell experiments was attenuated when experiments were carried out entirely in NaI external solution. Thus, the reduction in ICl and ICa observed in this study may result from a direct effect of I- on the phosphorylation/dephosphorylation of cardiac ion channel proteins or associated regulatory proteins.
