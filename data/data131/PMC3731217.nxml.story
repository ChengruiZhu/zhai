Colorectal cancer is the fourth leading cause of cancer related deaths worldwide, and a key genetic change associated with this disease is mutation of the gene APC. APC encodes a protein which plays a regulatory role in the Wnt signalling pathway. To better understand the mechanisms leading to colorectal cancer after APC loss, we have used a mouse model in which we deleted Apc in the bowel and which developed several characteristics of early stage cancers. Here, we show that after Apc loss, the expression of another gene, Cited1, is increased in mice and human colorectal tumours. To study the role of Cited1 in bowel cancer after loss of Apc, we generated mice mutant for Apc (Min) or mutant for Apc and Cited1 (MinCited1). We observed that MinCited1 mice developed fewer intestinal tumours and lived longer than Min mice suggesting that Cited1 is pro-tumourigenic. However, we also observed that Cited1 deficiency actually increased many of the aspects associated with loss of Apc, including deregulation of the Wnt pathway and cell death. To explain this apparent paradox, we propose a model whereby loss of Cited1, in the context of deregulated Wnt signalling, ‘over-stimulates’ the Wnt pathway, the net effect of which is to inhibit tumourigenesis.
