γ-catenin (Plakoglobin), a well-described structural protein functioning at the adherens junctions and desmosomes, was shown to be either lost or weakly expressed in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cells and tumor tissues. However, the tumor suppressive affects of γ-catenin were not fully understood. In this study, we have identified a novel role for the affects of γ-catenin on non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cell migration. Expression of γ-catenin in NSCLC cells resulted in reduced cell migration as determined by both scratch assays and trans-well cell migration assays. Moreover, the affects of γ-catenin on cell migration were observed to be p53-dependent. Mechanistically, the anti-migratory effects seen via γ-catenin were driven by the expression of hepatocyte growth factor activator inhibitor Type I (HAI-1 or SPINT-1), an upstream inhibitor of the c-MET signaling pathway. Furthermore, the re-expression of γ-catenin sensitized NSCLC cells to c-MET inhibitor-mediated growth inhibition. Taken together, we identify γ-catenin as a novel regulator of HAI-1, which is a critical regulator of HGF/c-MET signaling. Therefore, targeting γ-catenin-mediated HAI-1 expression might be a useful strategy to sensitize NSCLC to c-MET inhibitors.
