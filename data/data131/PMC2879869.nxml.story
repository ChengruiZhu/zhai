The extensive suffering related to a complex life situation with bipolar disorder (BD) and the reported difference between care needs and the needs that are actually met implicates that there are still questions about management of life with BD that need to be answered. The present study therefore aims to describe the meaning of the conditions that enable a good life with BD. Ten persons, six women and four men (aged 30–61), diagnosed with BD were interviewed. A reflective lifeworld perspective based on phenomenological philosophy was used. The findings present the essential meaning of the conditions that enable a good life with BD as a dependence that empowers, which is further described by its constituents: “turning the course of life,” “protecting oneself from running out of energy,” “being needed,” “being oneself through reliable others,” “personal landmarks for navigating through life.” A voluntary chosen dependence, as described in the present study, is a new approach of care that enables a good life with BD, while enhancing own power, freedom, and control. The conditions that enable a good life with BD are more than separate supporting measures. Therefore a holistic perspective is preferable while providing care for individuals with BD.
