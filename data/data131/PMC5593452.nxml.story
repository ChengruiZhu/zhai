CCAAT enhancer binding protein alpha (C/EBPα) is a transcription factor regulating the core aspects of cell growth and differentiation. The present study investigated the level and functional role of C/EBPα during the development of the rat lung. C/EBPα protein exhibits a dynamic expression pattern. The correlation between the expression of C/EBPα protein and the content of glycogen during lung maturation was analyzed to understand the function of C/EBPα in lung differentiation. The high expression of C/EBPα coincides with the reduction of glycogen in the fetal lung. In addition, the authors identified that changes in the level of C/EBPα are associated with the secretion of pulmonary surfactant. C/EBPα is modified by small ubiquitin-related modifier (SUMO) post-translationally. The results of double immunofluorescence staining and immunoprecipitation demonstrated that SUMO-modified C/EBPα was present in the lung. The sumoylated C/EBPα gradually decreased during lung differentiation and was negatively correlated with pulmonary surfactant secretion, thereby suggesting that the SUMO modification may participate in C/EBPα-mediated lung growth and differentiation. These results indicated that C/EBPα played a role in lung development and provided the insight into the mechanism underlying SUMO-modification.
