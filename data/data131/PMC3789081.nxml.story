The current study presents the case of a patient with a rare adverse event characterized by sudden vision loss in the untreated eye following an intravitreal injection of bevacizumab for neovascular glaucoma (NVG). The patient was diagnosed with NVG refractory to Ahmed glaucoma valve implantation and a vitreous hemorrhage in the right eye, which was treated with 1.25 mg intravitreal bevacizumab. Ten days after the bevacizumab injection, the left eye exhibited sudden visual loss. The patient’s best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) decreased from 80 to 25 letters [Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study (ETDRS) chart]. A fundus examination revealed a swollen optic disk with unclear boundaries, retinal hemorrhages and thinning retinal vessels. Fundus fluorescein angiography (FA) identified hyperfluorescence in the optic disk and an enlarged foveal avascular zone. The visual field revealed quadrantal defects that confirmed the diagnosis of anterior ischemic optic neuropathy associated with ischemic maculopathy. Six months later, following medical treatment, the patient’s BCVA was increased to 44 letters. However, a clinical examination found neovessels with one papilla disk (PD) above the disk. Laser photocoagulation treatment was administered immediately. The area of neovessels above the disk was reduced to 1/4 PD at the last follow-up. In conclusion, although intravitreal anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (Bevacizumab) is an effective treatment for neovascular ocular diseases, its adverse effects must be taken into consideration for the treatment of NVG. Photocoagulation remains an effective treatment for proliferative diabetic retinopathy.
