Neurilemmoma, also known as schwannoma, is an uncommon benign neoplasm that is most commonly found in the trunk and head and neck regions. The present study reports the case of a 67-year-old female with schwannoma localized in the anterior abdominal wall and analyzes the ultrasound and computed tomography (CT) imaging observations of the schwannoma. A dynamic time-intensity curve was also recorded in the study. A well-defined, elliptic low echo level, heterogeneous mass was observed during ultrasound examination. The CT scan revealed a solid, heterogeneous, low-density mass in the abdominal wall. Contrast-enhanced scans showed a heterogeneously enhanced mass during the arterial and venous phase. Centripetal fill-in was demonstrated and the mass was markedly, homogenously enhanced relative to the muscles during the delayed phase. Peak enhancement was observed during the venous phase and then slowly declined. However, the mass was hyperattenuated during the delayed phase. The lesion was completely excised and no evidence of recurrence has been identified during the 3 months of follow-up. The present study suggested that a diagnosis of schwannoma should be considered for certain patients with masses in the abdominal wall. Peripheral enhancement during the arterial and venous phases and homogeneous enhancement in the delayed phase are the significant imaging findings of a schwannoma.
