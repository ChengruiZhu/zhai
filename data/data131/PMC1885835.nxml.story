Multisubunit enzymes, such as protein phosphatase 2A, consist of a catalytic subunit and one of several regulatory subunits that are responsible for substrate specificity. Whereas this molecular architecture enables the assembly of a few components into many different substrate-specific enzymes, it possesses an inherent danger in the form of the uncomplexed catalytic subunit with its unspecific phosphatase activity. Until substrate-specific complexes assemble, the catalytic subunit would constitute a risk to the cell if no control mechanisms existed. We recently obtained evidence for the existence of the catalytic subunit in a low-activity conformation that requires an activator for the switch into the active conformation. This requirement suggested that the existing model of protein phosphatase 2A biogenesis was incomplete, because it could not explain how the activity of the catalytic subunit is kept in check until it is assembled with the substrate-targeting subunits. In this study, we provide evidence that the generation of the active catalytic subunit is coupled with and regulated by holoenzyme assembly. We propose a novel model of protein phosphatase biogenesis in which a tightly controlled activation cascade protects cells from the potential risk of unspecific dephosphorylation events.
