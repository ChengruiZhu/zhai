So as to develop more effective countermeasures against influenza, timely and precise information about influenza activity at schools, kindergartens, and nursery schools may be helpful. At the Infectious Diseases Surveillance Center of the National Institute of Infectious Diseases, a School Absenteeism Surveillance System (SASSy) has been in operation since 2009. SASSy monitors the activity of varicella, mumps, mycoplasma pneumonia, pharyngoconjunctival fever, hand-foot-mouth disease, influenza, and many other infectious diseases in schools. In 2010, SASSy was extended to the Nursery School Absenteeism Surveillance System (NSASSy). These systems record the number of absentees due to infectious diseases in each class of all grades of schools every day. As a powerful countermeasure to the pandemic flu of 2009, SASSy was activated in 9 prefectures, in which included more than 6000 schools, and it is gradually being adopted in other prefectures. As of February 2012, 18 prefectures and 4 big cities, which together comprised 15,700 schools (about 35% of all schools in Japan), utilized SASSy. NSASSy is used in more than 4100 nursery schools, which is about 18% of all nursery schools in Japan. Some studies of similar systems were performed in the UK (
