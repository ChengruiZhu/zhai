Chronic unpredictable stress alone induced depression-like behaviors in rats, but maternal deprivation enhanced the effect of chronic unpredictable stress. Escitalopram significantly decreased depression-like behaviors in chronic unpredictable stress rats but was less effective in maternal deprivation with chronic unpredictable stress rats. Maternal deprivation increased dopamine receptor D2 messenger RNA expression and decreased microRNA-9 expression in the striatum. Chronic unpredictable stress increased dopamine receptor D2 mRNA and protein levels and decreased microRNA-9 expression in the nucleus accumbens. Furthermore, maternal deprivation enhanced the effect of chronic unpredictable stress on dopamine receptor D2 gene and microRNA-9 expression. Chronic unpredictable stress increased the expression of microRNA-326 in the nucleus accumbens but decreased it in the striatum, whereas maternal deprivation elevated microRNA-326 expression in the striatum. Escitalopram normalized microRNA-326 expression but had no effect on the expression of microRNA-9, dopamine receptor D2 mRNA, and dopamine receptor D2 protein in both the nucleus accumbens and striatum. The in vitro study showed that only microRNA-9 directly targeted the 3â€™ untranslated region of dopamine receptor D2 mRNA and inhibited dopamine receptor D2 protein expression.
