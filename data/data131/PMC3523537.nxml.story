The KRAS oncogene is found in up to 30% of all human
tumors. In
2009, RNAi experiments revealed that lowering mRNA levels of a transcript
encoding the serine/threonine kinase STK33 was selectively toxic to
KRAS-dependent cancer cell lines, suggesting that small-molecule inhibitors
of STK33 might selectively target KRAS-dependent cancers. To test
this hypothesis, we initiated a high-throughput screen using compounds
in the Molecular Libraries Small Molecule Repository (MLSMR). Several
hits were identified, and one of these, a quinoxalinone derivative,
was optimized. Extensive SAR studies were performed and led to the
chemical probe ML281 that showed low nanomolar inhibition of purified
recombinant STK33 and a distinct selectivity profile as compared to
other STK33 inhibitors that were reported in the course of these studies.
Even at the highest concentration tested (10 Î¼M), ML281 had
no effect on the viability of KRAS-dependent cancer cells. These results
are consistent with other recent reports using small-molecule STK33
inhibitors. Small molecules having different chemical structures and
kinase-selectivity profiles are needed to fully understand the role
of STK33 in KRAS-dependent cancers. In this regard, ML281 is a valuable
addition to small-molecule probes of STK33.
