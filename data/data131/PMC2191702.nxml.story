Although diverse signaling events are initiated by stimulation of multichain immune recognition receptors on lymphocytes, it remains unclear as to which specific signal transduction pathways are functionally linked to granule exocytosis and cellular cytotoxicity. In the case of natural killer (NK) cells, it has been presumed that the rapid activation of protein kinase C (PKC) enables them to mediate antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) and "natural" cytotoxicity toward tumor cells. However, using cloned human NK cells, we determined here that Fc receptor stimulation triggers granule release and ADCC through a PKC-independent pathway. Specifically, pretreatment of NK cells with the selective PKC inhibitor, GF109203X (using concentrations that fully blocked phorbol myristate acetate/ionomycin-induced secretion) had no effect on FcR-initiated granule release or ADCC. In contrast, FcR ligation led to the rapid activation of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI 3-kinase), and inhibition of this enzyme with the selective inhibitor, wortmannin, blocked FcR-induced granule release and ADCC. Additional experiments showed that, whereas FcR-initiated killing was wortmannin sensitive and GF109203X insensitive, natural cytotoxic activity toward the tumor cell line K562 was wortmannin insensitive and GF109203X sensitive. Taken together, these results suggest that: (a) PI 3-kinase activation induced by FcR ligation is functionally coupled to granule exocytosis and ADCC; and (b) the signaling pathways involved in ADCC vs natural cytotoxicity are distinct.
