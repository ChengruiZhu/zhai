We have examined the effects of a variety of monovalent cations on K channel gating in squid giant axons. The addition of the permeant cations K, Rb, or Cs to the external medium decreases the channel closing rate and causes a negative shift of the conductance-voltage relationship. Both of these effects are larger in Rb than in K. The opening kinetics of the K channel are, on the other hand, unaffected by these monovalent cations. Other permeant species, like NH4 and Tl, slightly increase the closing rate, whereas the relatively impermeant cations Na, Li, and Tris have little or no effect on K channel gating. The permeant cations have different effects on the reversal potential and the shape of the instantaneous current-voltage relationship. These effects give information about entry and binding of the cations in K channels. Rb, for example, enters the pore readily (large shift of the reversal potential), but binds tightly to the channel interior, inhibiting current flow. We find a correlation between the occupancy of the channel by a monovalent cation and the closing rate, and conclude that the presence of a monovalent cation in the pore inhibits channel closing, and thereby causes a leftward shift in the activation-voltage curve. In causing these effects, the cations appear to bind near the inner surface of the membrane.
