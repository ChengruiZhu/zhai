 < 0.01 to identify genes that were upregulated compared with normal cells in each cancer type. The resulting list of significantly upregulated genes was cross-referenced with three categories of protein inhibitor targets, categorized by inhibitor type (‘Targets of US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved anticancer drugs’, ‘Targets of FDA-approved nonantineoplastic drugs’, or ‘Targets of non-FDA-approved chemical agents’). Of the 78 experimental groups studied, 57 (73%) represent cancers that are currently treated with FDA-approved targeted treatment agents. However, the target genes for the indicated therapies are upregulated in only 33 of these groups (57%). Nevertheless, the mRNA expression of the genes targeted by FDA-approved treatment agents is increased in every experimental group, including all of the cancers without FDA-approved targeted treatments. Moreover, many targets of protein inhibitors that have been approved by the FDA as therapies for nonneoplastic diseases, such as 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase and cyclooxygenase-2 and the targets of many non-FDA-approved chemical agents, such as cyclin-dependent kinase 1 and DNA-dependent protein kinase, are also overexpressed in many types of cancer.
