Breast cancer seriously impairs physical and mental health in females. Currently, with further investigation into drugs, a number of new pharmacological effects have been found that offer new methods for clinical application in the treatment of breast cancer. As a widely used antidiabetic drug, rosiglitazone (Ros) has become well known for its anticancer effects, mediated by the activation of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor Î³ and downregulated expression of the associated invasion gene. The objective of the present study was to investigate the combination of Ros and docetaxel (DOC) and whether DOC has any effect on breast cancer cell lines. The results showed that the combination of Ros and DOC may cooperate to increase anti-growth efficacy. The additive inhibitory effects on cell proliferation were sequence-dependent and are not likely to be associated with cell cycle arrest. This suggested that the target activation of associated factors of the signaling pathway by Ros may be a compelling ally in cancer treatment. In addition, evidence was provided for a convergence of Ros and DOC to induce the reduced expression of CD44v6. Future studies are required to confirm which associated gene of Ros is significant in blocking the signaling pathway.
