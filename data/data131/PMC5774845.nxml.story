It is well known that animals move their eyes, ears, and heads towards stimuli of interest to selectively gather information in complex environments. Interestingly, lingual-echolocating fruit bats, which generate sonar signals for object localization by clicking their tongues, can rapidly switch the direction of the sonar beam without changing head aim or mouth shape. The mechanism underlying this capability has intrigued scientists and engineers alike. In this study, we used a combination of experimental measurements and theoretical modeling to solve this mystery. We discovered that the focus of this bat’s sound beam shifts systematically across a range of angles as the sonar frequency increases. This unusual multi-frequency structure can be captured by modeling the sound emission as an array of sound sources located along the side of the mouth and driven by the clicking tongue. Changing only the position of the tongue in this model can steer the sonar beam in different directions, showing an effect broadly similar to that found in a human-made sonar phased array—a design that enables changing beam direction without changing the physical transducer assembly. Our study thus reveals an intriguing parallel between biology and human engineering, which arrived at fundamentally similar solutions to the same problem.
