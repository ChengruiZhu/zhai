The current importance of cell surface receptors as primary targets for drug treatment explains the increasing interest in a mathematical and quantitative description of the process of ligand-receptor interaction. Recently, a new generation of synthetic chimeric ligands has been developed to selectively target unhealthy cells, without harming healthy tissue. To understand these and other types of complex ligand-receptor systems, conventional chemical interaction models often rely on simplifications and assumptions about the spatial characteristics of the system, while full atomistic molecular dynamics simulations are too computationally demanding to perform many particle statistical analysis. In this paper, we describe a novel approach to model the interaction between ligands and receptors based on a coarse grained approximation that includes explicitly both spatial and kinetic details of the interaction, while allowing many-particle simulations and therefore, statistical analysis at biologically relevant time scales. The model is used to study the binding properties of generic chimeric ligands to understand how cell specificity is achieved, its dependence on receptor concentration and the influence of the distance between subunits of the chimera. Overall, this approach proves optimal to study other ligand-receptor systems with complex spatial regulation, such as receptor clustering, multimerization and multivalent asymmetric ligand binding.
