To maintain the complexity of living biological systems, many proteins must interact in a coordinated manner to integrate their unique functions into a cooperative system. Pathways are typically constructed to capture modular subsets of this dynamic network, each made up of a collection of biomolecular interactions of diverse types that together carry out a specific cellular function. Deciphering these pathways at a global level is a crucial step for unraveling systems biology, aiding at every level from basic biological understanding to translational biomarker and drug target discovery. The combination of high-throughput genomic data with advanced computational methods has enabled us to infer the first genome-wide compendium of bimolecular pathway networks, comprising 30 distinct bimolecular interaction types. We demonstrate that this interaction network compendium, derived from âˆ¼3,500 experimental conditions, can be used to direct a range of biomedical hypothesis generation and testing. We show that our results can be used to predict novel protein interactions and new pathway components, and also that they enable system-level analysis to investigate the network characteristics of cell-wide regulatory circuits. The resulting compendium of biological networks is made publicly available through an interactive web interface to enable future research in other biological systems of interest.
