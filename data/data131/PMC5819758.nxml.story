Symbiotic microbes influence host development and health, but predicting which microbes or groups of microbes will have a helpful or harmful effect is a major challenge in microbiome research. In this article, we describe a new method to design and predict bacterial communities that alter the plant host response to phosphate starvation. The method uses plantâ€“bacterium binary-association assays to define groups of bacteria that elicit similar effects on the host plant. By constructing partially overlapping bacterial communities, we demonstrated that it is possible to modify phosphate accumulation in the plant shoot and the induction of plant phosphate starvation genes in a controlled manner. We found that bacterial colonization of the plant root does not predict the capacity to produce this phenotype. We evaluated the predictive performance of different statistical models and identified one best able to predict the behavior of untested communities. Our work demonstrates that studying a subset of all possible bacterial communities is sufficient to anticipate the outcome of novel bacterial combinations, and we establish that it is possible to deduce causality between microbiome composition and host phenotypes in complex systems.
