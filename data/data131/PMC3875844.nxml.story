Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) of human origin have been frequently applied to experimental animal models to evaluate their immunomodulatory functions. MSCs are known to be activated by cytokines from T cells, predominantly by interferon-γ (IFN-γ), in conjunction with other cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) and interlukin-1β. Because IFN-γ is not cross-reactive between human and mouse species, the manner in which human MSCs administered in experimental animals are activated and stimulated to function has been questioned. In the present study, we established MSCs from human adipose tissue. They successfully suppressed the proliferation of not only human peripheral blood mononuclear cells but also mouse splenic T cells. When these human MSCs were stimulated with a culture supernatant of mouse T cells or recombinant murine TNF-α, they expressed cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), but not indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase. The dominant role of COX-2 in suppressing mouse T cell proliferation was validated by the addition of COX-2 inhibitor in the co-culture, wherein the suppressed proliferation was almost completely recovered. In conclusion, human MSCs in a murine environment were activated, at least in part, by TNF-α and mainly used COX-2 as a tool for the suppression of
