Parkinson’s disease is characterized by loss of dopaminergic neurons in midbrain and the presence of αSyn protein inclusions. Human αSyn mimics the disease pathology in yeast resulting in cytotoxicity and aggregate formation. αSyn is abundantly phosphorylated at serine S129 and possesses four tyrosines (Y39, Y125, Y133, and Y136) that can be posttranslationally modified by nitration or phosphorylation. The consequence of each of these possible modifications is still unclear. Nitration as consequence of oxidative stress is a hallmark for neurodegenerative diseases. Here, we addressed the molecular mechanism, how tyrosine posttranslational modifications affect αSyn cytotoxicity. Tyrosine nitration can contribute to αSyn toxicity or can be part of a cellular salvage pathway when di-tyrosine-crosslinked dimers are formed. The Y133 residue, which can be either phosphorylated or nitrated, determines whether S129 is protectively phosphorylated and αSyn inclusions are cleared. This interplay with S129 phosphorylation demonstrates a dual role for C-terminal tyrosine residues. Yeast flavohemoglobin Yhb1 and its human counterpart neuroglobin NGB protect cells against cytotoxicity and aggregate formation. These novel insights into the molecular pathways responsible for αSyn cytotoxicity indicate NGB as a potential target for therapeutic intervention in PD.
