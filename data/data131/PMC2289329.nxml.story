Plasmodium falciparum malaria parasites invade human erythrocytes by means of a parasite receptor for erythrocytes, the 175-kD erythrocyte binding antigen (EBA-175). Similar to invasion efficiency, binding requires N-acetylneuraminic acid (Neu5Ac) on human erythrocytes, specifically the glycophorins. EBA-175 bound to erythrocytes with receptor-like specificity and was saturable. The specificity of EBA-175 binding was studied to determine if its binding is influenced either by simple electrostatic interaction with the negatively charged Neu5Ac (on the erythrocyte surface); or if Neu5Ac indirectly affected the conformation of an unknown ligand, or if Neu5Ac itself in specific linkage and carbohydrate composition was the primary ligand for EBA-175 as demonstrated for hemagglutinins of influenza viruses. Most Neu5Ac on human erythrocytes is linked to galactose by alpha 2-3 and alpha 2-6 linkages on glycophorin A. Soluble Neu5Ac by itself in solution did not competitively inhibit the binding of EBA-175 to erythrocytes, suggesting that linkage to an underlying sugar is required for binding in contrast to charge alone. Binding was competitively inhibited only by Neu5Ac(alpha 2-3)Gal-containing oligosaccharides. Similar oligosaccharides containing Neu5Ac(alpha 2-6)Gal-linkages had only slight inhibitory effects. Binding inhibition assays with modified sialic acids and other saccharides confirmed that oligosaccharide composition and linkage were primary factors for efficient binding. EBA- 175 bound tightly enough to glycophorin A that the complex could be precipitated with an anti-glycophorin A monoclonal antibody. Selective cleavage of O-linked tetrasaccharides clustered at the NH2 terminus of glycophorin A markedly reduced binding in inhibition studies. We conclude that the Neu5Ac(a2,3)-Gal- determinant on O-linked tetrasaccharides of glycophorin A appear to be the preferential erythrocyte ligand for EBA-175.
