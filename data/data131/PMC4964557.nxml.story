Increasing evidences show that XRCC6 (X-ray repair complementing defective repair in Chinese hamster cells 6) was upregulated and involved in tumor growth in several tumor types. However, the correlation of XRCC6 and human osteosarcoma (OS) is still unknown. This study was conducted with the aim to reveal the expression and biological function of XRCC6 in OS and elucidate the potential mechanism. The mRNA expression level of XRCC6 was measured in osteosarcoma cells and OS samples by quantitative transcription-PCR (qRT-PCR). The expression of XRCC6 protein was measured using Western blot and immunohistochemical staining in osteosarcoma cell lines and patient samples. Cell Counting Kit 8 (CCK8), colony-forming and cell cycle assays were used to test cell survival capacity. We found that XRCC6 was overexpressed in OS cells and OS samples compared with the adjacent non-tumorous samples. High expression of XRCC6 was correlated with clinical stage and tumor size in OS. Reduced expression of XRCC6 inhibits OS cell proliferation through G2/M phase arrest. Most importantly, further experiments demonstrated that XRCC6 might regulate OS growth through the β-catenin/Wnt signaling pathway. In conclusion, these findings indicate that XRCC6 exerts tumor-promoting effects for OS through β-catenin/Wnt signaling pathway. XRCC6 may serve as a novel therapeutic target for OS patients.
