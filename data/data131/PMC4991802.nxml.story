During tumorigenesis, normal fibroblasts (NFs) within the tumor stroma acquire a modified phenotype and become cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs). CAFs provide oncogenic signals to facilitate tumor initiation, progression, and metastasis. Here, we set out to determine the factors that mediate the conversion of NFs into CAFs, focusing on miRNAs and secreted factors. Down-regulation of miR-1 and miR-206 and upregulation of miR-31 were found in CAFs derived from human lung cancer compared to paired NFs. Dysregulation of miR-1, miR-206 and miR-31 expression promotes the conversion of NFs into CAFs through regulating VEGFA, CCL2 and FOXO3a expression. In addition, down-regulation of miR-1 and miR-206 and up-regulation of miR-31 has been observed in lung cancer patient plasma. More importantly, we demonstrated that systemic delivery of anti-VEGFA/CCL2 or pre-miR-1, pre-miR-206 and anti-miR-31 dramatically decreased tumor angiogenesis, TAMs accumulation, tumor growth and lung metastasis. In conclusion, our data showed that miRNAs-mediated FOXO3a/VEGF/CCL2 signaling plays a prominent role in transforming NFs into CAFs, thus providing further support for the development of new diagnostic and therapeutic approaches to lung cancer.
