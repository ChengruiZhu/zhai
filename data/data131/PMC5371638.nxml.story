Chromosome territories assume non-random positions in the interphase nucleus with gene-rich chromosomes localized toward the nuclear interior and gene-poor chromosome territories toward the nuclear periphery. Lamins are intermediate filament proteins of the inner nuclear membrane required for the maintenance of nuclear structure and function. Here, we show using whole-genome expression profiling that Lamin A/C or Lamin B2 depletion in an otherwise diploid colorectal cancer cell line (DLD1) deregulates transcript levels from specific chromosomes. Further, three-dimensional fluorescence in situ hybridization (3D-FISH) analyses of a subset of these transcriptionally deregulated chromosome territories revealed that the diploid chromosome territories in Lamin-depleted cells largely maintain conserved positions in the interphase nucleus in a gene-density-dependent manner. In addition, chromosomal aneuploidies were induced in ~25Â % of Lamin A/C or Lamin B2-depleted cells. Sub-populations of these aneuploid cells consistently showed a mislocalization of the gene-rich aneuploid chromosome 19 territory toward the nuclear periphery, while gene-poor aneuploid chromosome 18 territory was mislocalized toward the nuclear interior predominantly upon Lamin B2 than Lamin A/C depletion. In addition, a candidate gene locus
