Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of death and disability worldwide. The primary prevention of CVD is dependent upon the ability to identify high-risk individuals long before the development of overt events. This highlights the need for accurate risk stratification. An increasing number of novel biomarkers have been identified to predict cardiovascular events. Biomarkers play a critical role in the definition, prognostication, and decision-making regarding the management of cardiovascular events. This review focuses on a variety of promising biomarkers that provide diagnostic and prognostic information. The myocardial tissue-specific biomarker cardiac troponin, high-sensitivity assays for cardiac troponin, and heart-type fatty acid binding proteinall help diagnose myocardial infarction (MI) in the early hours following symptoms. Inflammatory markers such as growth differentiation factor-15, high-sensitivity C-reactive protein, fibrinogen, and uric acid predict MI and death. Pregnancy-associated plasma protein A, myeloperoxidase, and matrix metalloproteinases predict the risk of acute coronary syndrome. Lipoprotein-associated phospholipase A2 and secretory phospholipase A2 predict incident and recurrent cardiovascular events. Finally, elevated natriuretic peptides, ST2, endothelin-1, mid-regional-pro-adrenomedullin, copeptin, and galectin-3 have all been well validated to predict death and heart failure following a MI and provide risk stratification information for heart failure. Rapidly developing new areas, such as assessment of micro-RNA, are also explored. All the biomarkers reflect different aspects of the development of atherosclerosis.
