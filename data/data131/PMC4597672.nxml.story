A 62-year-old man presented with a 4-month history of night sweats, high body temperature, and right knee pain in 2003. Two years previously, he had undergone a right TKA for treatment of gonarthrosis. Upon examination, the knee appeared swollen, warm, and sore, and a sinus tract formation had developed at the incision area. Bacteriologic cultures taken from the sinus tract discharge revealed B. melitensis. The patientâ€™s erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) was 83 mm/h, C-reactive protein (CRP) level was 12.38 mg/L, and blood leukocyte concentration was 9425/mm3. Plain radiography confirmed septic loosening. A two-stage revision TKA was planned. The first stage involved removal of the infected prosthesis and debridement of the remaining cement and necrotic tissue. Removal of the prosthetic components and cement and application of an antibiotic-loaded spacer (teicoplanin-impregnated) was also performed in the first stage. Oral rifampicin (900 mg) and doxycycline (300 mg) were administered daily for 12 weeks postoperatively. At the end of the antibiotic therapy, the patient was seen as an outpatient, and his ESR, CRP level, and antibody titer had decreased to normal values. Finally, prosthetic revision was performed in the second stage of the TKA.
