We explored the impact of patient demographics, anthropometric measurements, cardiovascular risk factors, and soluble biomarkers on necrotic core and atheroma size in patients with coronary disease. The IBIS-2 trial enrolled 330 patients. In the multivariate analysis, at baseline, creatinine had a positive, whereas baseline mean lumen diameter and myeloperoxidase had a negative, independent association with percentage of necrotic core (PNC); while age, glomerular filtration rate <60, HbA1c, previous PCI or CABG and baseline % diameter stenosis were positively, and acute coronary syndromes (ACS) were negatively associated with baseline percentage atheroma volume (PAV). The variables associated with a decrease in PNC from baseline were darapladib, ACS and a large content of NC at baseline, while variables associated with an increase in PNC were previous stroke and % diameter stenosis at baseline. Those variables associated with a decrease in PAV from baseline were waist circumference, statin use, CD40L and baseline PAV, while the only variable associated with an increase in PAV was baseline diastolic blood pressure. Treatment with darapladib was associated with a decrease in necrotic core, but was not associated with a decrease in percentage atheroma volume. On the contrary, statin use was only associated with a decrease in percentage atheroma volume.
