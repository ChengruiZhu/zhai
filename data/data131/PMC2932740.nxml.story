This paper discusses and provides unique insight into an important problem raised by the current state of genetic studies into disease susceptibility, namely whether we can reuse genetic data from participants genotyped as controls in one study when cases (people with a disease of interest) are obtained from other studies, or whether each new study needs its own controls. We are interested in whether studies where cases and controls are sampled differently will give correct answers and are as powerful statistically as when new control data is also genotyped. Because of the huge investments made recently in large scale genotyping of cases and controls for various diseases, this is a timely question. This question is especially important in understanding the genetic causes of disease in as-yet relatively understudied population groups, such as African-Americans, in order to speed up progress when this is possible. We give theoretical results about the power of studies that reuse existing control genotypes based on statistical considerations. We also provide analysis of real data from a major study of the genetic causes of breast cancer in African-American women in order to shed practical light upon this issue.
