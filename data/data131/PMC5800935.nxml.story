Anti-PD-1/PD-L1 antibodies have been proved one of the most promising treatments against non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC); however, whether anti-PD-1/PD-L1 antibodies can provide added benefits for pretreated patients with advanced NSCLC and which patients are most likely to benefit from anti-PD-1/PD-L1 therapy remain controversial. This meta-analysis evaluated the efficacy and safety between anti-PD-1/PD-L1 antibodies and docetaxel in previously treated, advanced NSCLC. PubMed, EMBASE and Cochrane library databases were systematically searched for eligible studies. Five studies with a total of 3,025 patients were included. Our results showed that, for all patients, anti-PD-1/PD-L1 therapy prolonged overall survival (OS) (hazard ratio [HR] = 0.69; 95% CI, 0.63–0.75) and progression-free survival (PFS) (HR = 0.87; 95% CI, 0.80–0.94). For patients with PD-L1 expression ≥1%, anti-PD-1/PD-L1 therapy had higher objective response rates. In subgroup analysis according to the tumor PD-L1 expression level, anti-PD-1/PD-L1 therapy was associated with longer OS and PFS in patients with high PD-L1 expression (≥1%, ≥5%, ≥10% and ≥50%), but not in those with low expressions. In subgroup analysis of patients’ characteristics, anti-PD-1/PD-L1 antibodies showed OS benefits across most prespecified subgroups, except for patients with
