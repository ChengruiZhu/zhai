Soluble epoxide hydrolase (sEH) is a promising therapeutic target for the treatment of hypertension, pain, and inflammation-related diseases. In order to enable the development of sEH inhibitors (sEHIs), assays are needed for determination of their potency. Therefore, we developed a new method utilizing an epoxide of arachidonic acid (14(15)-EpETrE) as substrate. Incubation samples were directly injected without purification into an online solid phase extraction (SPE) liquid chromatography electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry (LC–ESI–MS–MS) setup allowing a total run time of only 108 s for a full gradient separation. Analytes were extracted from the matrix within 30 s by turbulent flow chromatography. Subsequently, a full gradient separation was carried out on a 50X2.1 mm RP-18 column filled with 1.7 μm core–shell particles. The analytes were detected with high sensitivity by ESI–MS–MS in SRM mode. The substrate 14(15)-EpETrE eluted at a stable retention time of 96 ± 1 s and its sEH hydrolysis product 14,15-DiHETrE at 63 ± 1 s with narrow peak width (full width at half maximum height: 1.5 ± 0.1 s). The analytical performance of the method was excellent, with a limit of detection of 2 fmol on column, a linear range of over three orders of magnitude, and a negligible carry-over of 0.1% for 14,15-DiHETrE. The enzyme assay was carried out in a 96-well plate format, and near perfect sigmoidal dose–response curves were obtained for 12 concentrations of each inhibitor in only 22 min, enabling precise determination of IC
