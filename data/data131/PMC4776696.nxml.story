In recent decades, outpatient commitment orders have been increasingly used in the follow-up of persons with serious mental disorders. Most studies on outpatient commitment orders have focused on compliance and consumption of health care services; there is little research on the content of outpatient commitment orders from a patient perspective. The aim of this study is to examine patients’ experiences of living with outpatient commitment orders, and is based on qualitative interviews with 16 persons in two Norwegian counties. The data were analysed using a constructivist, interpretive approach to the grounded theory method. The main finding was that patients with outpatient commitment orders felt that their lives were on hold. The feeling of being seen only as patients prevented them from taking responsibility for their own lives. The medical context was perceived as an obstacle to recovery and transition to a more normal life. Patients’ daily lives were dominated by the agenda set by health care providers and many said they were subjected to control measures that resulted in a reduced quality of life. However, informants also spoke of positive experiences as outpatient commitment order patients, such as feeling safe and secure and having easy access to health care staff and services.
