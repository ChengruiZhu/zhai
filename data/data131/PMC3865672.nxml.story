Although beneficial effects of granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) have been demonstrated on post-myocardia infarction (MI) process, the mechanisms and feasibility are not fully agreed yet. We investigated effects of a long-term treatment with a low-dose G-CSF started 1 day after the onset of MI, on post-infarction process. One day after being made MI by left coronary ligation, mice were given G-CSF (10 Î¼g/kg/day) for 4 weeks. The G-CSF treatment resulted in a significant mitigation of cardiac remodelling and dysfunction. In the G-CSF-treated hearts, the infarcted scar was smaller with less fibrosis and abundant vessels while in the non-infarcted area, hypertrophic cardiomyocytes with attenuated degenerative changes and reduced fibrosis were apparent. These effects were accompanied by activation of signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) and Akt and also by up-regulation of GATA-4, myosin heavy chain and matrix metalloproteinases-2 and -9. Apoptosis of cardiomyocytes appeared insignificant at any stages. Parthenolide, a STAT3 inhibitor, completely abolished the beneficial effects of G-CSF on cardiac function and remodelling with loss of effect on both anti-cardiomyocyte degeneration and anti-fibrosis. In contrast, wortmannin, an Akt inhibitor, did not affect G-CSF-induced benefis despite cancelling vessel increase. In conclusion, treatment with G-CSF at a small dose but for a long duration beneficially affects the post-infarction process possibly through STAT3-mediated anti-cardiomyocyte degeneration and anti-fibrosis, but not through anti-cardiomyocyte apoptosis or Akt-mediated angio-genesis. The findings may also imply a more feasible way of G-CSF administration in the clinical settings.
