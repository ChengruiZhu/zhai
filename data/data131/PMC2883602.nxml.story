The high mutation rate of RNA viruses, such as HIV, allows them to rapidly evolve resistance to host defenses and antiviral drugs. A new approach to treating these viruses—lethal mutagenesis—turns the mutation rate of these viruses against them. It uses mutagens to increase the viruses' mutation rates so much that the accumulation of harmful mutations drives viral populations to extinction. Is there any way that a virus could adapt to a drug that increases its mutation rate? One way is that the virus could evolve so that mutations tend to be less harmful. In previous experimental work, there have been reports that virus populations can differ in robustness. Yet, the evolution of mutational robustness did not seem to inhibit extinction by lethal mutagenesis. In this work, we model viral populations under lethal mutagenesis in order to see when viruses might escape extinction by evolving robustness to mutations. We find that viruses can benefit from robustness only at relatively low mutation rates because the extent to which robustness increases fitness is rapidly drowned out by the extent to which higher mutation rates decrease fitness. The implication is that the evolution of mutational robustness is not a fundamental impediment to lethal mutagenesis therapy.
