First, we examined whether the PPARβ/δ agonist GW501516 prevents lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced cytokine production in differentiated 3T3-L1 adipocytes. Treatment with GW501516 blocked LPS-induced IL-6 expression and secretion by adipocytes and the subsequent activation of the signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3)–Suppressor of cytokine signaling 3 (SOCS3) pathway. This effect was associated with the capacity of GW501516 to impede LPS-induced NF-κB activation. Second, in in vivo studies, white adipose tissue from Zucker diabetic fatty (ZDF) rats, compared with that of lean rats, showed reduced PPARβ/δ expression and PPAR DNA-binding activity, which was accompanied by enhanced IL-6 expression and NF-κB DNA-binding activity. Furthermore, IL-6 expression and NF-κB DNA-binding activity was higher in white adipose tissue from PPARβ/δ-null mice than in wild-type mice. Because mitogen-activated protein kinase–extracellular signal–related kinase (ERK)1/2 (MEK1/2) is involved in LPS-induced NF-κB activation in adipocytes, we explored whether PPARβ/δ prevented NF-κB activation by inhibiting this pathway. Interestingly, GW501516 prevented ERK1/2 phosphorylation by LPS. Furthermore, white adipose tissue from animal showing constitutively increased NF-κB activity, such as ZDF rats and PPARβ/δ-null mice, also showed enhanced phospho-ERK1/2 levels.
