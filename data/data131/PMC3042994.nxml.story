The orientation of the head-tail axis is determined during embryogenesis by the movements of a subset of cells called the AVE (anterior visceral endoderm). These cells migrate from their initial position within the simple epithelium of the visceral endoderm (VE) to a location from which they eventually induce anterior pattern in the adjacent epiblast. Little is understood about how AVE cells migrate within the VE, why they stop migrating where they do, and how surrounding cells in the VE respond to or influence AVE migration. In this study, we use time-lapse microscopy and high-resolution 3D reconstructions of protein localisation patterns to address these issues. Our results show that AVE cells move by exchanging neighbours within an intact epithelium. The limits of AVE migration are determined by regional differences in cell behaviour and protein localisation within an otherwise apparently uniform VE. Finally, we examine the role of planar cell polarity (PCP) signalling, which is responsible for coordinating morphogenetic events across different epithelia. We show that in addition to this traditional role in coordinating global cell movements, PCP signalling along with TGFÎ² signalling can demarcate regions of differing behaviour within epithelia, thereby modulating the movement of cells within them.
