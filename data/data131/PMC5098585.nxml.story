Glioma patients have a poor overall survival; however, patients can show distinct clinical outcomes due to the high heterogeneity of the tumor, which may be indicated by certain clinicobiological parameters. Kinesin family member 20A (KIF20A), which participates in cytokinesis and intracellular transportation, has been recently reported to be upregulated in pancreatic cancer, breast cancer, and bladder cancer. In the current study, we investigated the expression of KIF20A in gliomas and its significance in predicting the prognosis after surgery. We found that KIF20A positive expression in glioma tissues correlated significantly with Ki67 protein expression and advanced World Health Organization grade. Univariate and multivariate analysis revealed that KIF20A can act as an independent prognostic factor for predicting the overall survival of glioma patients. Moreover, we demonstrated that KIF20A can positively regulate the expression of Ki67 in glioma cell lines. Correspondingly, overexpression of KIF20A can promote cell proliferation and invasion, whereas knockdown of KIF20A can inhibit cell viability and invasion capacity. In vitro study also showed that under the treatment of plumbagin, an anticancer drug, KIF20A expression decreased in a dose-dependent manner. In addition, the overexpression of KIF20A can also increase the drug resistance toward plumbagin, which provided the possibility that KIF20A may contribute to the chemotherapy resistance of gliomas.
