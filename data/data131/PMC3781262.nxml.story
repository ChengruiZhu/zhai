 strain (PS). The developed mutants were screened, selected and characterized. The mutant, PS-UM1 developed after UV exposure alone, indicated a small increase in β-glucosidase production (718 U/l) in comparison to the wild-type strain, PS (675 U/l). The mutant, PS-CM5 developed after EMS exposure alone, displayed a slightly better production (762 U/l) than both the above strains. However, after exposure of the wild-type strain to both UV and EMS mutagens jointly, a better mutant (PS-CM5-UM3) was developed with 1.2-fold increase in production (806 U/l). Further, optimization of culture conditions by classical “one-variable-at-a-time” approach was done to determine the optimum, pH, temperature and nitrogen sources. The selected mutant (PS-CM5-UM3) produced up to 1,797 U/l enzyme and was found to be stable for ten generations. The β-glucosidase from the selected mutant (PS-CM5-UM3) was concentrated and purified using ammonium sulfate, dialysis and size-exclusion chromatography. The enzyme displayed maximal activity at 60 °C and it was found to be fairly stable at temperatures up to 70 °C for 30 min. Its molecular weight was determined to be around 60 kDa by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE).
