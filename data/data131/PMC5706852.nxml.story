Global DNA methylation of long interspersed nucleotide elements (LINE-1) in leukocytes has been suggested to be a risk factor for a few cancers. There has been no report of LINE-1 methylation in leukocytes as a risk factor for aggressive prostate cancer at diagnosis and prognosis after treatments. In this study, we measured the leukocyte DNA methylation of LINE-1 in 795 PCa patients and compared the methylation levels across different clinical subgroups. We then determined the association of LINE-1 methylation in leukocytes with clinicopathological variables at diagnosis using logistic regression analysis and biochemical recurrence in patients receiving active treatments (prostatectomy and radiotherapy) using Cox proportional hazard model after adjusting for age, BMI, smoking status, pack year, Dâ€™Amico risk groups, and treatments. Overall, the DNA methylation of LINE-1 was not associated with the risk of being diagnosed with high-risk prostate cancer or the risk of biochemical recurrence upon active treatments. Future studies are warranted to investigate other types of repetitive element methylation and longitudinal changes of global methylation in relation to prostate cancer risk and prognosis.
