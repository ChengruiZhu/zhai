Dickkopf-1 (DKK1) is an ideal target for the immunotherapy of multiple myeloma. Heat Shock protein70 (HSP70) is a class of important molecular chaperone to promote antigen presentation. Homologous xenogeneic antigens can enhance immunogenicity and induce stronger anti-tumor immune response than that of allogeneic ones. Therefore, we constructed human DKK1 and human HSP70 DNA fusion vaccine (hDKK1-hHSP70), and then determined its anti-tumor immuno- genicity and anti-tumor effects on immunizing BALB/c mice already inoculated with NS-1 murine multiple myeloma cells in prophylactic and therapeutic models using cytotoxic T lymphocytes, enzyme-lined immunosorbent assay, flow cytometry, immunohistochemistry and Hochest staining. The side effects of vaccines were also monitored. We found that hDKK1-hHSP70 fusion vaccine could significantly inhibit tumor growth and prolonged the survival of the mice, whether prophylactic or therapeutic immunotherapy in vivo, by eliciting both humoral and cellular tumor-specific immune responses. A significant decrease of proliferation and increase of apoptosis were also observed in the tumor tissues injected with hDKK1-hHSP70 vaccine. These findings showed the xenogeneic homologous vaccination had stronger immunogenicity and minimal toxicity. Our study may provide an effective and safety immonutheraphy strategy for multiple myeloma.
