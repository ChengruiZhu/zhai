Angiogenesis (the growth of new blood vessels) is essential in most of the body’s physiological processes, such as in the normal functioning of the endometrium during and after the menstrual cycle. Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) are the mostly expressed angiogenic factors, especially, during the process of endometrial degeneration and remodeling. In carcinogenesis, tumor hypoxia-induced factors, through the process of “angiogenic switch”, stimulate the production of angiogenic factors, particularly VEGF and MMP. Subsequently, these angiogenic factors are associated with degradation, differentiation, proliferation, and migration of vascular endothelial cells, enhancing the formation of new blood vessels to supply the tumor with oxygen and nutrients. This process is equally significant for tumor development and metastasis. Hence, like in other cancers, the overexpression of MMP and VEGF in endometrial cancer (EC) seems to play a significant role in its tumorigenesis and metastasis. This research will discuss the influence of MMP and VEGF on angiogenesis, metastasis, and the prognosis of EC as well as the clinical importance of the factors in the diagnosis of EC.
