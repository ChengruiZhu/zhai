Analogy is claimed to be the core of human cognition due to its pervasive involvement in phenomena such as language, reasoning and learning. However, this phenomenon has mainly been studied in isolation through computational methods, which has made it difficult to appreciate its different roles in diverse cognitive phenomena. Recent studies have signaled that abstract concepts from category theory are able to describe constructions carried out by the human mind, thus presenting this formal theory as a general framework to study cognition. Our contribution here is to provide a model of analogy that bridges a gap between the formal notions of category theory and the psychological notions of cognition. We illustrate the usefulness of this approach by using our model to represent and analyze three different cognitive phenomena. Besides showing that some abstract mathematical concepts can describe concrete cognitive notions such as re-representation, learning, conceptual knowledge, and procedural knowledge, the process of mathematical modeling is presented here as an alternative for outlining relations between cognitive notions and for developing novel conceptualizations of the involved cognitive phenomena.
