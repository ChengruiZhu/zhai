Nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) is common in South China. Although regional epidemiological data on NPC in China is available, national epidemiological data have been unavailable up to now. The goal of this study was to analyze the NPC incidence and mortality data in some domestic cancer registries, estimate these rates in China in 2010, and provide scientific information that can be harnessed for NPC control and prevention. To accomplish this goal, NPC incidence and mortality data for 2010 were collected from 145 Chinese cancer registries from which data were included in the 2013 National Cancer Registry Annual Report. Such indices as its incident and death numbers, crude rates, age-standardized rates and truncated rates were calculated and analyzed. The incidence and mortality in China and constituent areas were estimated according to the national population in 2010. An estimated 41,503 new cases and 20,058 deaths were attributed to NPC in China in 2010, accounting for 1.34% of all new cancer cases and 1.03% of all cancer-related deaths that year in China. Crude incidence and mortality were 3.16/100,000 and 1.53/100,000, respectively. World age-standardized incidence and mortality were 2.44/100,000 and 1.18/100,000, respectively. Incidence and mortality were higher among males than among females and slightly higher in urban areas than in rural areas. Among seven Chinese administrative regions, NPC incidence and mortality were obviously higher in South China than in other regions and lowest in North China. The male and female age-specific incidence and mortality both rose quickly from age 25-29 years, but peaked at different ages and varied by location. These results demonstrated that NPC incidence and mortality in China especially in South China were at high levels in the world, and suggested that control and prevention efforts should be enhanced.
