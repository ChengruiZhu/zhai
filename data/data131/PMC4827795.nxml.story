Next-generation sequencing (NGS) technologies that have advanced rapidly in the past few years possess the potential to classify diseases, decipher the molecular code of related cell processes, identify targets for decision-making on targeted therapy or prevention strategies, and predict clinical treatment response. Thus, NGS is on its way to revolutionize oncology. With the help of NGS, we can draw a finer map for the genetic basis of diseases and can improve our understanding of diagnostic and prognostic applications and therapeutic methods. Despite these advantages and its potential, NGS is facing several critical challenges, including reduction of sequencing cost, enhancement of sequencing quality, improvement of technical simplicity and reliability, and development of semiautomated and integrated analysis workflow. In order to address these challenges, we conducted a literature research and summarized a four-stage NGS workflow for providing a systematic review on NGS-based analysis, explaining the strength and weakness of diverse NGS-based software tools, and elucidating its potential connection to individualized medicine. By presenting this four-stage NGS workflow, we try to provide a minimal structural layout required for NGS data storage and reproducibility.
