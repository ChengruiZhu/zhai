 dose calculation model for computing neutron doses. Measured neutron data were acquired by an IC30 ion chamber flowing 5 cc/min of tissue equivalent gas. Output factors and profile scans for open and wedged fields were measured according to the Pinnacle physics reference guide recommendations for photon beams in a Wellhofer water tank scanning system. Following the construction of a neutron beam model, computed doses were then generated using 100 monitor units (MUs) beams incident on a water‐equivalent phantom for open and wedged square fields, as well as multileaf collimator (MLC)‐shaped irregular fields. We compared Pinnacle dose profiles, central axis doses, and off‐axis doses (in irregular fields) with 1) doses computed using the Prism treatment planning system, and 2) doses measured in a water phantom and having matching geometry to the computation setup. We found that the Pinnacle photon model may be used to model most of the important dosimetric features of the CNTS fast neutron beam. Pinnacle‐calculated dose points among open and wedged square fields exhibit dose differences within 3.9 cGy of both Prism and measured doses along the central axis, and within 5 cGy difference of measurement in the penumbra region. Pinnacle dose point calculations using irregular treatment type fields showed a dose difference up to 9 cGy from measured dose points, although most points of comparison were below 5 cGy. Comparisons of dose points that were chosen from cases planned in both Pinnacle and Prism show an average dose difference less than 0.6%, except in certain fields which incorporate both wedges and heavy blocking of the central axis. All clinical cases planned in both Prism and Pinnacle were found to be comparable in terms of dose‐volume histograms and spatial dose distribution following review by the treating clinicians. Variations were considered minor and within clinically acceptable limits by the treating clinicians. The Pinnacle TPS has sufficient computational modeling ability to adequately produce a viable neutron model for clinical use in treatment planning.
