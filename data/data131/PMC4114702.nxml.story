The present study aimed to investigate polypoid colonic metastases from gastric stump carcinoma by performing a retrospective analysis of the clinical data of a patient with such a diagnosis, and by discussing other previous case studies from the literature. The patient of the present study was an 80-year-old male who had undergone a gastrectomy 48 years previously for a benign perforated gastric ulcer. A colonoscopy revealed >10 multiple polypoid lesions of 6â€“10 mm in diameter distributed throughout the entire colon, except in the rectum. Each lesion had either erosion or a depression at the top and several were covered with a white fur-like substance. Biopsy specimens excised from the stomach showed a poorly-differentiated adenocarcinoma with diffuse signet ring cells, and a colonoscopy-guided biopsy revealed a signet ring cell adenocarcinoma. The patient was referred to the Oncology unit (Beijing Shijitan Hospital, Beijing, China) for assessment and chemotherapy treatment, which was initiated with 1,000 mg Xeloda orally administered twice a day for two-week courses every three weeks. The patient succumbed to upper gastrointestinal hemorrhage and pneumonia after three months. Gastric or gastric stump carcinoma may metastasize to the colon presenting as solitary or multiple colonic polyps. Thus, it is important to consider this diagnosis as such colon metastases may mimic solitary or multiple colonic polyps, which are commonly observed. A differential diagnosis is required in this complicated situation.
