B7-H3, a member of the B7 family of molecules, is expressed in certain types of human cancer and is important in tumor development and progression. Although several studies have reported that the expression of B7-H3 is correlated with poor outcomes in patients with cancer, its exact role in cancer remains unknown. In the present study, the expression levels of B7-H3 in the pathological specimens of 105 patients treated for non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) were examined by immunohistochemistry. A high expression level of B7-H3 was observed in 46.9% of the 105 NSCLC tissue specimens. These patients demonstrated a more advanced tumor grade and a shorter survival time. In addition, we also examined the levels of tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) in NSCLC tissues and observed that the levels were positively correlated with the expression of B7-H3, and that higher levels of macrophages were associated with lower levels of infiltrating T cells and a shorter survival time. These results demonstrated that TAMs are important in the evasion of tumor immune surveillance in NSCLC. Furthermore, through knockdown of B7-H3 by RNA interference, we observed that soluble B7-H3 was capable of inducing macrophages to express higher levels of macrophage mannose receptor (MMR) and lower levels of human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-DR, as well as higher levels of interleukin-10 (IL-10) and lower levels of IL-1Î²
