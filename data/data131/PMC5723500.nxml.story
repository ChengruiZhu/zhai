A new method of generating wedge‐shaped dose distributions through dynamic multileaf collimator dose delivery rather than computer‐controlled jaw motion is presented. The method starts with the calculation of a wedge‐shaped beam profile for the desired wedge angle. The resultant wedge beam profile is then passed to the intensity‐modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) leaf sequence generation algorithm to create multileaf collimator (MLC) segments for dose delivery. Wedge‐shaped dose distributions are achieved through dynamic MLC dose delivery guided with the generated MLC segments. The method has been tested by generating wedge‐shaped doses for a set of conventional wedge angles (i.e., 15°, 30°, 45°, and 60°). Film dosimetry is used for dose distribution verification. For each dose delivery guided with MLC segments created for the indicated wedge angle, the desired wedge‐shaped dose distributions are observed. It is concluded that the dynamic MLC can be used to implement dynamic wedges in the clinic. This technique is different from the virtual wedge or the dynamic wedge developed for a particular type of LINAC. The same method can be applied to any machine equipped with a MLC. Other advantages are that it can generate a wedge field at an arbitrary orientation as the omni wedge does, and it creates wedged and shaped fields using a MLC only.
