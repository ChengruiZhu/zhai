The dosimetric advantage of modulated electron radiotherapy (MERT) has been explored by many investigators and is considered to be an advanced radiation therapy technique in the utilization of electrons. A computer‐controlled electron multileaf collimator (MLC) prototype, newly designed to be added onto a Varian linac to deliver MERT, was investigated both experimentally and by Monte Carlo simulations. Four different electron energies, 6, 9, 12, and 15 MeV, were employed for this investigation. To ensure that this device was capable of delivering the electron beams properly, measurements were performed to examine the electron MLC (eMLC) leaf leakage and to determine the appropriate jaw positioning for an eMLC‐shaped field in order to eliminate a secondary radiation peak that could otherwise appear outside of an intended radiation field in the case of inappropriate jaw positioning due to insufficient radiation blockage from the jaws. Phase space data were obtained by Monte Carlo (MC) simulation and recorded at the plane just above the jaws for each of the energies (6, 9, 12, and 15 MeV). As an input source, phase space data were used in MC dose calculations for various sizes of the eMLC shaped field (
