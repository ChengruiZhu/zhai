Protein kinase Cs (PKCs) are activated by antigen receptors in lymphocytes, but little is known about proximal targets for PKCs in antigen receptor–mediated responses. In this report, we define a role for diacylglycerol-regulated PKC isoforms in controlling the activity of the serine/threonine kinase protein kinase D (PKD; also known as PKCμ) in T cells, B cells, and mast cells. Antigen receptor activation of PKD is a rapid and sustained response that can be seen in T cells activated via the T cell antigen receptor, B cells activated via the B cell antigen receptor, and in mast cells triggered via the high-affinity receptor for IgE (FcεR1). Herein, we show that antigen receptor activation of PKD requires the activity of classical/novel PKCs. Moreover, PKC activity is sufficient to bypass the requirement for antigen receptor signals in the induction of PKD activity. These biochemical and genetic studies establish a role for antigen receptor–regulated PKC enzymes in the control of PKD activity. Regulation of PKD activity through upstream PKCs reveals a signaling network that exists between different members of the PKC superfamily of kinases that can operate to amplify and disseminate antigen receptor signals generated at the plasma membrane.
