Molecular networks are maps of the tens of thousands of interactions that occur between the components of biological systems. Types of interactions include physical, genetic and functional interactions between genes, gene products and metabolites. Network-based approaches to molecular biology are increasingly being used to better understand cellular functions. Currently, gene set methods can be used to functionally annotate the hits from high-throughput studies; however, no methods exist to functionally annotate molecular interaction networks. This greatly limits our ability to quantify the often subtle functional adaptions that occur in networks as they rewire to respond to external stimuli. Here, we extend well-tested concepts from spatial statistics to define a general association measure between networks and gene sets. Like Gene Set Enrichment Analysis, our approach measures concordant changes, but does this on networks, rather than on lists of genes. We validate it both in simulations and real-world case studies. We apply our approach to genetic interaction networks mapped under different conditions and created using different methods, and demonstrate how it extends the previous analyses of data sets, allowing us to better understand the high-level changes that occur within cells.
