Fungal infections in children rarely occur, but continue to have a high morbidity and mortality despite the development of newer antifungal agents. It is essential for these infections to be diagnosed at the earliest possible stage so appropriate treatment can be initiated promptly. The addition of high-resolution computer tomography (HR CT) has helped in early diagnosis making; however, it lacks both sensitivity and specificity. Metabolic changes precede anatomical changes and hybrid imaging with positron emission tomography (PET) integrated with imaging modalities with high anatomical resolution such as CT or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is likely to detect these infections at an earlier stage with higher diagnostic accuracy rates. Several authors presented papers highlighting the advantages of PET/CT in imaging fungal infections. These papers, however, usually involve a limited number of patients and mostly adults. Fungal infections behave different in children than in adults, since there are differences in epidemiology, imaging findings, and response to treatment with antifungal drugs. This paper reviews the literature and explores the use of hybrid imaging for diagnosis and therapy decision making in children with fungal infections.
