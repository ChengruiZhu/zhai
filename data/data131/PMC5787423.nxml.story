Transgelin is an actin-binding protein that regulates cell motility and other important cellular functions. Previous studies have suggested that transgelin expression is associated with cancer development and progression, but its specific role in colorectal cancer (CRC) remains controversial. We analyzed expression of transgelin and its candidate downstream target, tensin 1 (TNS1), in CRC patients using the ONCOMINE, Protein Atlas, and OncoLnc databases. Transgelin and TNS1 mRNA and protein levels were higher in CRC patients and CRC cell lines than in normal tissues and cells. Survival analyses using the OncoLnc database revealed that elevated TAGLN/TNS1 levels were associated with a poor overall survival in CRC patients. Transgelin suppression using siRNA decreased TNS1 expression in CRC cells, demonstrating that transgelin induces the TNS1 expression. Importantly, suppression of transgelin or TNS1 using siRNA decreased proliferation and invasiveness of CRC cells. These results suggest that transgelin/TNS1 signaling promotes CRC cell proliferation and invasion, and that transgelin/TNS1 expression levels could potentially serve as a prognostic and therapeutic target in CRC patients.
