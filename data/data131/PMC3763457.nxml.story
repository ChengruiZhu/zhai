B, formerly suspected to solely promote cell survival, can also be manipulated to induce cell death. Current understanding of the cell death pathways involved in influenza virus-mediated cytopathology and in virus replication is limited. This study was designed to identify host genes that are required for influenza-induced cell death. The approach was to perform genome-wide lentiviral-mediated human gene silencing in A549 cells and determine which genes could be silenced to provide resistance to influenza-induced cell death. The assay proved to be highly reproducible with 138 genes being identified in independent screens. The results were independently validated using siRNA to each of these candidates. Graded protection was observed in this screen with the silencing of any of 19 genes, each providing >85% protection. Three gene products, TNFSF13 (APRIL), TNFSF12-TNFSF13 (TWE-PRIL) and USP47, were selected because of the high levels of protection conferred by their silencing. Protein and mRNA silencing and protection from influenza-induced cell death was confirmed using multiple shRNA clones and siRNA, indicating the specificity of the effects. USP47 knockdown prevented proper viral entry into the host cell, whereas TNFSF12-13/TNFSF13 knockdown blocked a late stage in viral replication. This screening approach offers the means to identify a large number of potential candidates for the analysis of viral-induced cell death. These results may also have much broader applicability in defining regulatory mechanisms involved in cell survival.
