Brachytherapy of local cervical cancer is generally accomplished through film‐based treatment planning with the prescription directed to point A, which is invisible on images and is located at a high‐dose gradient area. Through a standard reconstruction method by digitizing film points, the location error for point A would be 3 mm with a condition of 30° curvature tandem, which is 10° away from the gantry rotation axis of a simulator, and has an 8.7 cm interval between the flange and the isocenter. To reduce the location error of the reconstructed point A, this paper proposes a method and demonstrates its accuracy. The Cartesian coordinates of point A were derived by acquiring the locations of the cervical os (tandem flange) and a dummy seed located in the tandem above the flange. To verify this analytical method, ball marks in a commercial “Isocentric Beam Checker” were selected to simulate the two points A, the os, and the dummies. The Checker was placed on the simulator couch with its center ball coincident with the simulator isocenter and its rotation axis perpendicular to the gantry rotation axis. With different combinations of the Checker and couch rotation angles, the orthogonal films were shot and all coordinates of the selected points were reconstructed through the treatment planning system and compared with that calculated through the analytical method. The position uncertainty and the deviation prediction of point A were also evaluated. With a good choice of the reference dummy point, the position deviations of point A obtained through this analytical method were found to be generally within 1 mm, with the standard uncertainty less than 0.5 mm. In summary, this new method is a practical and accurate tool for clinical usage to acquire the accurate location of point A for the treatment of cervical cancer patient.
