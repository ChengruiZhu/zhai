Although long-standing colonic inflammation due to refractory inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) promotes the development of colitis-associated cancer (CAC), the molecular mechanisms accounting for the development of CAC remains largely unknown. In this study, we investigated the role of gankyrin in the development of CAC since gankyrin is overexpressed in sporadic colorectal cancers. We analyzed gene expression of colon tissues obtained from 344 patients with IBD and CAC and found that expression of gankyrin was much higher in colonic mucosa of patients with refractory IBD than in those with IBD in remission. Expression of gankyrin was upregulated in inflammatory cells as well as tumor cells in colonic mucosa of patients with CAC. Over-expressing studies utilizing tagged ganlyrin-cDNA identified physical interaction between ganlyrin and Src homology 2-containing protein tyrosine phosphatase-1 (SHP-1). Importantly, the interaction between ganlyrin and SHP-1 leads to inhibition of STAT3 activation and to enhancement of TNF-Î± and IL-17 in inflammatory cells. To further address the role of gankyrin in the development of CAC, we created mice with intestinal epithelial cell-specific gankyrin ablation (
