The dialogue between the synapse and the nucleus plays an important role in the physiology of neurons because it links brief changes in the membrane potential to the transcriptional regulation of genes critical for neuronal survival and long-term memory. The propagation of activity-induced calcium signals to the cell nucleus represents a major route for synapse-to-nucleus communication. Here we identified nuclear calcium-regulated genes that are responsible for a neuroprotective shield that neurons build up upon synaptic activity. We found that among the 185 genes controlled by nuclear calcium signaling, a set of 9 genes had strong survival promoting activity both in cell culture and in an animal model of neurodegeneration. The mechanism through which several genes prevent cell death involves the strengthening of mitochondria against cellular stress and toxic insults. The discovery of an activity-induced neuroprotective gene program suggest that impairments of synaptic activity and synapse-to-nucleus signaling, for example due to expression of Alzheimer's disease protein or in aging, may comprise the cells' own neuroprotective system eventually leading to cell death. Thus, malfunctioning of nuclear calcium signaling could be a key etiological factor common to many neuropathological conditions, providing a simple and unifying concept to explain disease- and aging-related cell loss.
