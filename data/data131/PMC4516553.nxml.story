 in infection. However, the molecular basis for changes of TJ during ischaemia-reperfusion (I/R) injury is poorly understood. In the present study, intestinal damage was induced by I/R in an animal model. As assessed by TUNEL and propidium iodide uptake, we showed that I/R injury induced apoptosis as well as necrosis in rat colon, and the frequency of apoptotic and necrotic cells reached the maximum at 5 hrs of reperfusion. Immunofluorescence microscopy revealed that claudins 1, 3 and 5 are strongly expressed in the surface epithelial cells of the colon; however, labelling of all three proteins was present diffusely within cells and no longer focused at the lateral cell boundaries after I/R. Using Western blot analysis, we found that distribution of TJ proteins in membrane microdomains of TJ was markedly affected in I/R injury rats. Occludin, ZO-1, claudin-1 and claudin-3 were completely displaced from TX-100 insoluble fractions to TX-100 soluble fractions, and claudin-5 was partly displaced. The distribution of lipid raft marker protein caveolin-1 was also changed after I/R. I/R injury results in the disruption of TJs, which characterized by relocalization of the claudins 1, 3 and 5 and an increase in intestinal permeability using molecular tracer measurement. I/R injury altered distribution of TJ proteins
