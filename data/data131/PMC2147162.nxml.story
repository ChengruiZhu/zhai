 1. The volume-tonicity relations for human red cells exposed to a temperature of 48°C. for 2 minutes remain the same as those for unheated human red cells. The heated systems show lysis in higher tonicities than the unheated systems do; this is probably largely due to fragmentation with its effect on the geometry of the situation, as suggested by Ham, Shen, Fleming and Castle. When the cells are heated to 48°C. for longer times, the amount of fragmentation becomes considerable, but the volume-tonicity relation remains the same as before; the properties which are usually referred to as the osmotic properties of the red cell are accordingly not necessarily dependent on the integrity of the cell as a unit. 2. Heating to 52°C. for 2 minutes profoundly modifies the volume-tonicity relation, very little swelling now occurring even in tonicities as low as 0.6. This is partly accounted for by the large K losses and K-Na exchanges which occur and which become greater as the tonicity is reduced and as the temperature is increased. Fragmentation and hemolysis also increase, the latter out of proportion to the expected effects of the former. Direct effects of heat on the cohesion of the red cell ultrastructure are probably involved.
