A significant amount of information about how enzymes and other proteins function has been obtained from computer simulations. Often, the size of the system that is required to provide a sufficiently realistic model places limitations on both the timescale of the simulation, and the level of detail that can be studied. Computational approaches that utilise more than one type of method (so-called ‘multiscale methods’) allow the size of system, and timescale of study, to be increased. Membrane-bound proteins, such as cytochrome P450 enzymes (P450s), are an example of where multiscale simulations can be used. P450s are important in drug metabolism, and are known to be involved in adverse drug reactions. Access of substrate to the active site of these enzymes through the membrane is not well-understood. In the present work, a simulation pipeline is presented that leads through the construction and refinement of a realistic protein:membrane system by molecular dynamics simulations to reaction modelling. An important drug-metabolising P450, CYP3A4, is used as an example, together with the anticoagulant drug R-warfarin. Our investigations reveal that a membrane-bound model is required to fully capture the gating mechanisms and substrate ingress/egress channels. The simulation protocol described here is transferrable to other membrane-bound proteins.
