Factors related to endocrine changes and hormone substitution treatment during pre- and post-operation periods in craniopharyngioma cases were examined. Twenty patients who underwent tumor resection from January 2012 to January 2015 were included in the study. We monitored factors related to endocrine changes and hormone substitution treatment during pre- and post-operation periods. Blood thyroid-stimulating hormone, triiodothyronine, thyroxine, prolactin, follicle-stimulating hormone, luteinizing hormone and cortisol levels were measured in the patients. Urinary volume and urine specific gravity were also measured before and after the operation. After the operation, we observed diabetes insipidus and a decrease in TSH and gonadal hormone levels more frequently compared to pre-operation. However, incidence of high prolactin was markedly reduced following surgery. The number of hypothyroidism cases before and after surgery had no statistical significance. In conclusion, surgery for craniopharyngioma aggravated endocrine dysfunction. Craniotomy and total tumor resection had considerable effects on the endocrine system. Routine hormone therapy as an alternative treatment was necessary after operation. Alternative treatment of adrenal cortex hormones reduced the incidence on low blood cortisol.
