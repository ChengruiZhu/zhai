Glucocorticoids are essential steroid hormones, and synthetic glucocorticoids are widely prescribed for a variety of medical conditions. Understanding the mechanism by which glucocorticoids act requires knowing the direct target genes whose expression levels are modulated by the glucocorticoid signaling pathway. In this publication, Le and colleagues have utilized two high-throughput techniques to determine genes directly regulated in vivo by the glucocorticoid receptor (GR). RNA and chromatin were extracted from the livers of mice injected with the synthetic glucocorticoid dexamethasone and compared to control littermates. The analysis of RNA expression levels generated a list of genes differentially expressed after addition of dexamethasone. The analysis of the chromatin produced a list of gene promoter sequences where the GR was bound to DNA. By intersecting the two lists, the researchers obtained a list of genes that are directly controlled by the GR, including several previously known targets. This list of direct targets was then used as the basis for complex pathways and sequence analyses, which suggested several interactions between the GR and other transcription factors. This study provides an evaluation of a medically important signaling pathway and serves as a model for future analyses of transcriptional regulation.
