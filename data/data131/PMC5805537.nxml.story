Radioactive-iodine (RAI) therapy is typically unprevailing as anaplastic thyroid cancer (ATC) management, owing to the decrease in the endogenous sodium iodide symporter (NIS) expression. Therefore, new strategies for NIS re-induction are required to improve the efficacy of RAI therapy in ATC. In this study, we developed a novel high-throughput NIS enhancer screening platform using a dual reporter gene system to identify a potent tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) and selected a new hit compound, K905-0266 TKI. The effects of K905-0266 TKI treatment was validated as RAI accumulation, changes in signalling pathway related to thyroid pathogenesis, and cytotoxicity of RAI depending on re-induction of endogenous NIS expression in ATC. Furthermore, we evaluated enhancement of NIS promoter and therapeutic efficacy of RAI in ATC tumour xenograft mice. After K905-0266 TKI treatment, the expression of endogenous NIS was significantly increased, while phosphorylated-ERK was decreased. In addition, the thyroid-metabolising protein expressions were upregulated and increased of RAI accumulation and its therapeutic effects in ATC. Moreover, K905-0266 TKI increased therapeutic efficacy of RAI in ATC tumour
