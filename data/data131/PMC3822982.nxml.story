 on a mixture of fibronectin/fibrinogen/tropoelastin, although HUVEC migration remains unaffected. Culturing HUVEC on tropoelastin induces increased expression of VCAM-1 (13.1 ± 4.4 pg/ml), ICAM-1 (5.1 ± 1.3 pg/ml) and IL-8 (11.6 ± 3.1 pg/ml) compared to fibronectin (0.7 ± 0.2, 0.8 ± 0.2, 2.3 ± 0.5 pg/ml, respectively), although expression levels on fibronectin/fibrinogen/tropoelastin remain unaltered. No significant differences in VCAM-1, ICAM-1 and IL-8 mRNA expression are found in VSMC. Finally, HUVEC cultured on tropoelastin display a fivefold increased tissue factor activity (511.6 ± 26.7%), compared to cells cultured on fibronectin (100 ± 3.9%) or fibronectin/fibrinogen/tropoelastin (76.3 ± 25.0%). These results indicate that tropoelastin inhibits VSMC migration but leads to increased inflammatory and procoagulant markers on endothelial cells. Fibronectin/fibrinogen/tropoelastin inhibits VSMCs while compensating the inflammatory and procoagulant effects. These data suggest that coating a mixture of fibronectin/fibrinogen/tropoelastin on a stent may promote reendothelialization, while keeping unfavourable processes such as restenosis and procoagulant activity limited.
