Genetic recombination not only promotes genetic diversity in a population but also insures the integrity of an organism's genome. Inappropriate or inefficient recombination drives tumor formation in cancers and underlies certain premature aging diseases in humans, such as Bloom's and Werner's syndromes. To gain insight into the role of recombination in these diseases, the researchers developed a means of observing recombination in individual cells. They accomplish this by repeatedly monitoring the positions of the two chromosomal segments participating in recombination. Their observations show that interacting strands undergo repeated association and dissociation prior to fully completing recombination. This view contradicts the accepted model of recombination as an uninterrupted, continuous process, but explains, as has been observed, how sequences from different regions of the genome might arrive at a single site after recombination. Moreover, their results show that mutants lacking the Bloom's or Werner's genes have difficulty bringing the interacting strands of DNA together. Such delays could lead to errors in genome structure that could account for the disease characteristics. In short, observing recombination in individual cells reveals unexpected but important features of this process.
