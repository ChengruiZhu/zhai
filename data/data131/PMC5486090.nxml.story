) gene encodes rapidly activating delayed rectifier K channels (I Kr). Both ion channels have also been shown to bind to Nedd4-2 via a conserved Proline-Tyrosine (PY) motif in C-terminal with subsequent ubiquitination and degradation by proteasome. Therefore, loss of Nedd4-2 C2 isoform might be involved in electrophysiological impairment under various conditions. We demonstrate here that Nedd4-2 C2 isoform causes cardiac conduction change in resting condition as well as proarrhythmic change after acute myocardial infarction (MI). The Nedd4-2 C2 knockout (KO) mice showed bradycardia, prolonged QRS, QT intervals, and suppressed PR interval in resting condition. In addition, enhancement of T peak/T end interval was found in mice with surgical ligation of the distal left coronary artery. Morphological analyses based on both ultrasonography of the living heart, as well as histopathological findings revealed that Nedd4-2 C2 KO mice show no significant structural changes from wild-type littermates under resting conditions. These results suggested that Nedd4-2 with C2 domain might play an important role in cardio-renal syndrome through post-transcriptional modification of both ENaC and cardiac ion channels, which are critical for kidney and heart functions.
