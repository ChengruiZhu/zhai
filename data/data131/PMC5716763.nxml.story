), which is economically important freshwater fish in China. Males grow faster than females, and there is significant interest in developing methods to skew breeding towards all-males to increase biomass yields. NGS was conducted on DNAs of individual female and male, the male reads were spitted into 60 bp K-mers and aligned to the female reference genome assembled by female reads, unaligned male K-mers-60 were kept in next filter process. Meanwhile, DNA sample of 48 females was pooled and sequenced, this data was further used to filter out the previous unaligned male K-mers-60. Hence, numbers of candidate Y chromosome-specific sequences were screened out, their sex-specificity were validated in wild snakeheads through PCR amplification. Finally, three Y chromosome-specific fragments (Contig-275834, Contig-359642, and Contig-418354) were identified, and specific primers were obtained to distinguish the sex of snakehead. Additionally, a pair of primers of Contig-275834 (275834X/Y-F and 275834X/Y-R) was exploited to distinguish XX females, XY males, and YY super-males, whose amplification products of different lengths were produced for different sexes. Therefore, our work demonstrated the ability of NGS data in identification of sex-specific markers, and the pipeline adopted in our study could be applied in any species of sex differentiation. Furthermore, the sex-specific markers have tremendous potential for improving the efficiency of all-male breeding practices in snakehead.
