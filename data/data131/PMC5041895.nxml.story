-tetradecanoylphorbol 13-acetate (TPA)-induced cell migration model, it was shown that TPA increased fascin-1 mRNA and protein expression and fascin-1-dependent cell migration. TPA dose- and time-dependently increased PKCδ and STAT3α activation and GSK3β phosphorylation; up-regulated Wnt-1, β-catenin, and STAT3α expression; and increased the nuclear translocation of β-catenin and STAT3α. Rottlerin, a PKCδ inhibitor, abrogated the increases in STAT3α activation and β-catenin and fascin-1 expression. WP1066, a STAT3 inhibitor, suppressed TPA-induced STAT3α DNA binding activity and β-catenin expression. Knockdown of β-catenin attenuated TPA-induced fascin-1 and STAT3α expression as well as cell migration. In addition to MCF-7, migration of Hs578T breast cancer cells was inhibited by silencing fascin-1, β-catenin, and STAT3α expression as well. TPA also induced Wnt-1 expression and secretion, and blocking Wnt-1 signaling abrogated β-catenin induction. DHA pretreatment attenuated TPA-induced cell migration, PKCδ and STAT3α activation, GSK3β phosphorylation, and Wnt-1, β-catenin, STAT3α, and fascin-1 expression. Our results demonstrated that TPA-induced migration is likely associated with the PKCδ and Wnt-1 pathways, which lead to STAT3α activation, GSK3β inactivation, and β-catenin increase and up-regulation of fascin-1 expression. Moreover, the anti-metastatic potential of DHA is partly attributed to its suppression of TPA-activated PKCδ and Wnt-1 signaling.
