) and other biochemical parameters were measured in the serum of 32 arsenicosis patients of Bangladesh at three different age groups, namely, group 1 (10–18 years, 9 patients), group 2 (19–40 years, 14 patients) and group 3 (41–70 years, 9 patients) of the locality of Stadium Para of Meherpur district of Bangladesh. The values were compared with the same number of age-matched normal healthy individuals of the respective group. DBH activity was markedly decreased in the patients of group 1 as compared to that of the normal healthy people. The activities of DBH were decreased to lesser extents for the other two age groups. The total protein contents in the serum of arsenicosis patients were also significantly low as compared to that in the age-matched control groups. The levels of ascorbic acid and copper were found to be decreased in the serum of arsenicosis patients. The serum glucose levels were elevated in arsenicosis patients, as compared to that of the respective healthy controls. Other parameters, such as zinc and vitamin A levels were also decreased in the serum of arsenicosis patients. It was evident from the results of drinking of the arsenic contaminated water of shallow tube wells that the levels of DBH activity decreased significantly as compared to the control healthy persons. The levels of proteins, ascorbic acid, copper, zinc and vitamin A were decreased in the serum of people drinking the arsenic contaminated tube wells water as compared to that in the control healthy people with the exception that the levels of glucose were elevated in the serum of these patients. The pathophysiological significance of the results could be correlated with the decreased in proteins and that in DBH activities as DBH deficiency is characterized by lack of sympathetic noradrenergic function.The general physiologic findings of autonomic function indicate that complete DBH deficiency include minimal or absent plasma norepinephrine and epinephrine.
