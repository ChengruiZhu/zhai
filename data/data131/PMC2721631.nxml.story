Type VII glycogen storage disease (GSDVII), or Tarui disease, is a rare genetic disorder characterized by glycogen accumulation in skeletal muscle. The molecular cause is loss of activity of the muscle isoform of phosphofructokinase (PFK), which phosphorylates fructose-6-phosphate to fructose-1,6-bisphosphate, commiting glucose to glycolysis. Entry of fructose-6-phosphate into glycolysis is thus blocked, increasing glycogen synthesis and accumulation. Clinical manifestations of the disease are heterogeneous, ranging from exercise intolerance to early childhood death. To further understand the human pathology, we generated mice lacking muscle PFK. As in human patients, these mice showed severe exercise intolerance, hemolysis, and most died young. Lack of glycolysis in skeletal muscle also causes alterations in bioenergetics and compensatory changes in key metabolic genes. Additionally, although erythrocytes retained 50% of normal PFK activity, their overall functionality was impaired, aggravating the muscle dysfunction. Moreover, marked metabolic alterations in the heart lead to chronic hypertrophy, suggesting that cardiac pathology in GSDVII may be underestimated or misdiagnosed. This study indicates that this disease is more complex than a muscle glycogenosis and that symptoms other than those classically described should be taken into consideration. Finally, this animal model will enable us to develop new therapeutic approaches and better diagnostic tools.
