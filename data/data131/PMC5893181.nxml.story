Primary bronchus-associated lymphoid tissue (BALT) lymphoma comprises 5% of non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma (NHL) and usually has an indolent course. Synchronous primary lung cancers with BALT lymphoma are seldom seen in patients with adenocarcinoma of the lung. Synchronous squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) and BALT lymphoma is an extremely rare occurrence. We report an unusual case of stage 4 BALT lymphoma requiring treatment that revealed an underlying ipsilateral mass causing a diagnostic dilemma. An 84-year-old female with a history of systemic lupus erythematosus, deep vein thrombosis, and thrombotic microangiopathy presented to the hospital with cough and dyspnea on exertion. A chest X-ray revealed right hemi-thorax opacification and computed tomography (CT) of the chest showed a large right effusion and a soft tissue density extending into the proximal right bronchus. She required repeated thoracentesis until the pleural fluid analysis showed the presence of small lymphocytes and bronchial washings revealed an abnormal B cell population consistent with extranodal marginal zone lymphoma. The patient received four cycles of bendamustine and rituximab resulting in near-complete resolution of the effusion. Four months from diagnosis, imaging showed an increase in the size of the soft tissue density with pathologic fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) uptake on positron emission tomography (PET). A CT-guided biopsy was consistent with squamous cell lung cancer (SCLC) and radiotherapy was started for clinical stage 2 disease since the patient was not a surgical candidate. BALT lymphoma is a low-grade malignancy classified as extranodal marginal zone lymphoma with a five-year survival rate of over 80%. Several cases of synchronous lung adenocarcinoma and BALT lymphoma have been described. However, our case is among the rare few cases of synchronous occurrence of SCLC with BALT lymphoma. This report highlights the challenges associated with establishing an accurate and timely diagnosis.
