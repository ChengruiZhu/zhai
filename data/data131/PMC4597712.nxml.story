We have included 18 patients with retrofibular pain, 13 were female and 5 were male. The mean age was 46.8 (29-71). Preoperatively taken MRI scans showed talar osteochondral lesions (TOL) in 8 patients, peroneal tenosynovitis in 8 patients (3 of them were with TOL), suspected peroneal tendon rupture in 3 patients (2 of them were with TOL, accessory peroneal tendon in 1 patient). MRI scans of 5 patients were normal regarding peroneal pathology, these patients were operated according to physical examinations and the findings. 13 of 18 patients had accompanying anterior and posterior ankle pathologies. The most common pathology which had been detected in 8 patients with retrofibular pain was talar ostechondral lesion (TOL). The other 5 patients had no concomitant pathology. During peroneal tendoscopy, accessory peroneal tendon in 6 patients and distal insertion of peroneus brevis tendon in 3 patients had been detected and excised minimally invasively. In 4 patients, peroneal tendon rupture had been detected and excision/repair/tenodesis had been performed, in 3 patients tenosynovectomy had been performed for peroneal tenosynovitis, duplication had been performed in 1 patient, tubulisation had been performed in 1 patient and vincula excision had been performed in 1 patient.
