Many years since the booming of research on perovskite solar cells (PSCs), the hybrid perovskite materials developed for photovoltaic application form three main categories since 2009: (i) high‐performance unstable lead‐containing perovskites, (ii) low‐performance lead‐free perovskites, and (iii) moderate performance and stable lead‐containing perovskites. The search for alternative materials to replace lead leads to the second group of perovskite materials. To date, a number of these compounds have been synthesized and applied in photovoltaic devices. Here, lead‐free hybrid light absorbers used in PV devices are focused and their recent developments in related solar cell applications are reviewed comprehensively. In the first part, group 14 metals (Sn and Ge)‐based perovskites are introduced with more emphasis on the optimization of Sn‐based PSCs. Then concerns on halide hybrids of group 15 metals (Bi and Sb) are raised, which are mainly perovskite derivatives. At the same time, transition metal Cu‐based perovskites are also referred. In the end, an outlook is given on the design strategy of lead‐free halide hybrid absorbers for photovoltaic applications. It is believed that this timely review can represent our unique view of the field and shed some light on the direction of development of such promising materials.
