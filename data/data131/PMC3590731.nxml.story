An increasing number of adult patients have been seeking orthodontic treatment, and a short treatment time has been a recurring request. To meet their expectations, a number of innovative techniques have been developed to accelerate orthodontic tooth movement. Significant acceleration in orthodontic tooth movement has been extensively reported following a combination of selective alveolar decortication and bone grafting surgery with the latter being responsible for the increased scope of tooth movement and the long-term improvement of the periodontium. Six patients who have been diagnosed as class I malocclusion with bimaxillary protrusion were selected. A modified corticotomy procedure was carried out The active orthodontic treatment was begun within 1 week after surgery and follow up. All the patients reported the minmalpain and mild swelling 2 days following the surgical procedure. The mean treatment time for these patients was 17.4 months, with the distalization of the canines being mostly completed in 8.5 months. Periodontallyaccelerated osteogenicsorthodontic tooth movement procedure or selective alveolar decortications or corticotomy approach is one of the surgical techniques developed to reduce the time for orthodontic treatment. This newer approach is leading to short orthodontic treatment time and great patient acceptance.
