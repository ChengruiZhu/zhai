The therapy of erosive lichen planus (ELP) has been particular problem in the treatment of oral lesions. This case of ELP in male patient 29 years old was treated with topic application of the NBF gingival gel, three times a day after meal, previously rinsed with Clorhexidine gluconate 0.12%. After 5 days of treatment, initial improvements were recorded, and after two weeks of application of the NBF gingival gel we observed significant improvement. Clinical monitoring after the fifth day showed mild epithelialization of the eroded mucosa, yet still present erythematous base of the lesion. After the second week the erythema area was significantly reduced and the eroded surfaces of the mucosa were minimal, measured less than 0.5 mm. After the third week there were no erosions to detect on the oral mucosa, yet still present vague redness, which completely pulled after the fourth week. Treatment ended after the fifth week when the topical application of the NBF gingival gel was terminated, and therapy was done, and clinically achieved effects remained stable even after the third month of the treatment. Topic application of the NBF gingival gel with ELP patients showed positive clinical effects in relatively short time period.
