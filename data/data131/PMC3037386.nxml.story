A comprehensive mathematical description of the growth of an organ can be given by the velocity vectors defining the displacement of each tissue point in a fixed coordinate system plus a description of the degree of mixing between the cells. As an alternative to live imaging, a way to estimate the collection of such velocity vectors, known as velocity vector field, is to use cell-labeling experiments. However, this approach can be applied only when the labeled populations have been grown for small periods of time and the tensors of the velocity vector field can be estimated directly from the shape of the labeled population. Unfortunately, most of the available cell-labeling experiments of developmental systems have been generated considering a long clone expansion time that is more suitable for lineaging studies than for estimating velocity vector fields. In this study we present a new computational method that allows us to estimate the velocity vector field of limb tissue movement by using clonal data with long harvesting time and a sequence of experimental limb morphologies. The method results in the first realistic 2D model of limb outgrowth and establishes a powerful framework for numerical simulations of limb development.
