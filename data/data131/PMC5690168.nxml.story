I seeds. The dose delivered to the tumor and normal tissues have been calculated in both phantoms with and without GNPs. Normally, the radiation therapy of cancer patients is designed to deliver a required dose to the tumor while sparing the surrounding normal tissues. However, as the normal and cancerous cells absorbed dose in an almost identical fashion, the normal tissue absorbed radiation dose during the treatment time. The use of GNPs in combination with radiotherapy in the treatment of tumor decreases the absorbed dose by normal tissues. The results indicate that the dose to the tumor in an eyeball implanted with COMS plaque increases with increasing GNPs concentration inside the target. Therefore, the required irradiation time for the tumors in the eye is decreased by adding the GNPs prior to treatment. As a result, the dose to normal tissues decreases when the irradiation time is reduced. Furthermore, a comparison between the simulated data in an eye phantom made of water and eye phantom made of human eye composition, in the presence of GNPs, shows the significance of utilizing the composition of eye in ophthalmic brachytherapy dosimetry Also, defining the eye composition instead of water leads to more accurate calculations of GNPs radiation effects in ophthalmic brachytherapy dosimetry.
