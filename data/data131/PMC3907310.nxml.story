Discovering genetic origins of healthspan and lifespan could lead to breakthroughs in increasing the years of healthy and long life. In this paper we characterize the association of the e4 allele of the well-studied ApoE gene with lifespan in two generations of participants of large longitudinal studies, the Framingham Heart Study and the Long Life Family Study, and investigate the role of major human diseases such as cardiovascular disease, cancer, and neurodegenerative disorders in this association. This wide range of systemic analyses is possible given the large sample with directly genotyped ApoE polymorphism available from these studies (N = 9841, with 2557 deaths). The analyses show that women's lifespan is more sensitive to the e4 allele than men's in these populations. However, the strongly adverse effect of the e4 allele is not observed for all women, but only for those 70 to 95 years old. Cardiovascular disease, cancer, and neurodegenerative disorders do not mediate the association of the e4 allele with lifespan. However, cancer, but not cardiovascular and neurodegenerative diseases, non-additively enhances this effect resulting in 4.2 years of difference in mean lifespan for the e4 allele carriers compared to the non-carriers.
