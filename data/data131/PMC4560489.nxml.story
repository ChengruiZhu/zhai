Inhibition of the CD28:CD80/CD86 T cell costimulatory pathway has emerged as an effective strategy for the treatment of T cellâ€“mediated inflammatory diseases. However, patient responses to CD28-ligand blockade by abatacept (CTLA-4-Ig) in conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis are variable and often suboptimal. In this study, we show that the extent to which abatacept suppresses T cell activation is influenced by the strength of TCR stimulation, with high-strength TCR stimulation being associated with relative abatacept insensitivity. Accordingly, cyclosporin A, an inhibitor of T cell stimulation via the TCR, synergized with abatacept to inhibit T cell activation. We also observed that 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 enhanced the inhibition of T cell activation by abatacept, strongly inhibiting T cell activation driven by cross-linked anti-CD3, but with no effect upon anti-CD28 driven stimulation. Thus, like cyclosporin A, 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 inhibits TCR-driven activation, thereby promoting abatacept sensitivity. Vitamin D3 supplementation may therefore be a useful adjunct for the treatment of conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis in combination with abatacept to promote the efficacy of treatment.
