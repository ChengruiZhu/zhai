 Triton WR-1339, a non-ionic detergent, added to canine serum or to ultracentrifugally separated lipoproteins, induced changes in the lipoproteins which were dependent upon concentration of detergent and class of lipoproteins. D 1.063 to 1.21 lipoprotein (α-LP) was especially sensitive to the action of triton. Addition of 2 mg. of triton to 1 mg. of α-LP (based on protein content), induced only slight changes in the electrophoretic and flotation characteristics of the lipoprotein. With a tenfold increase of the detergent (triton:α-LP, 20:1), the mixture, analyzed by starch gel and paper electrophoresis, yielded a tritonlipid complex which remained close to the origin, and a nearly lipid-free protein with electrophoretic mobility higher (starch gel) or lower (paper) than native α-LP. The splitting of the lipid and protein moieties of α-LP could not be clearly shown when the same mixture was analyzed by free boundary electrophoresis. Triton alone moved only slightly in an electrical field (paper, starch gel, Tiselius); it sedimented during ultracentrifugation at D 1.006 and D 1.063 and floated at D 1.21. D 1.006 to 1.063 lipoproteins (β-LP), required larger amounts of triton to show changes. These were evident in 40 to 80:1 mixtures of triton and β-LP. In starch gel and paper electrophoresis triton retained, in a position close to the origin, part of the lipids of β-LP; the remaining β-LP fraction, impoverished of lipids, had electrophoretic mobility similar to native β-LP. The triton-lipid complex sedimented at D 1.063. After addition of triton to complexes [chylomicron-α-P-I
