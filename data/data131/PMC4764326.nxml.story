Humans experience a visually stable world despite the fact that eye, head, and body movements cause frequent shifts of the image on the retina. Humans and monkeys are also able to keep track of visual stimuli across such movements. One mechanism that may contribute to these abilities is “transsaccadic remapping,” in which the responses of some neurons in various attentional, oculomotor, and visual brain areas appear to anticipate the consequences of saccades. A current hypothesis proposes that the brain maintains “attentional pointers” to the locations of relevant stimuli and that, via transsaccadic remapping, it rapidly relocates these pointers to compensate for intervening eye movements. Whether stimulus features are also remapped across saccades (along with their location) remains unclear. Here, we show the presence of transsaccadic remapping in a macaque monkey brain area critical for visual motion processing, the middle temporal area (MT). This remapped response is stronger for an attended stimulus. We find only weak evidence for motion-direction information in the remapped response. These results support the attentional pointer hypothesis and demonstrate for the first time, to our knowledge, the impact of top-down attention on transsaccadic remapping in the brain.
