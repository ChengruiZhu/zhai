Products of multiexon genes, especially in higher organisms, are a mixture of isoforms with different or even opposing functions, and therefore need to be treated separately. However, most studies and available resources such as Gene Ontology provide only gene-level function annotations, and therefore lose the differential information at the isoform level. Here we report MIsoMine, a high-resolution portal to multiple levels of functional information of alternatively spliced isoforms in the mouse. This data portal provides tissue-specific expression patterns and co-expression networks, along with such previously published functional genomic data as protein domains, predicted isoform-level functions and functional relationships. The core utility of MIsoMine is allowing users to explore a preprocessed, quality-controlled set of RNA-seq data encompassing diverse tissues and cell lineages. Tissue-specific co-expression networks were established, allowing a 2D ranking of isoforms and tissues by co-expression patterns. The results of the multiple isoforms of the same gene are presented in parallel to facilitate direct comparison, with cross-talking to prioritized functions at the isoform level. MIsoMine provides the first isoform-level resolution effort at genome-scale. We envision that this data portal will be a valuable resource for exploring functional genomic data, and will complement the existing functionalities of the mouse genome informatics database and the gene expression database for the laboratory mouse.
