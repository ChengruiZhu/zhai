Bone and joint tuberculosis is a chronic debilitating condition that leads to progressive damage and even deformity of joints. It may affect one or multiple sites. It could present in a myriad of ways which may result in an incorrect diagnosis being made. Common misdiagnoses include seronegative inflammatory arthritis, septic arthritis, malignancy, osteoporotic fractures and mechanical type back pain. It was initially only diagnosed in patients with previous active tuberculosis or latent tuberculosis. However, in recent years, it has also been reported in patients without a history of previous tuberculosis infection. Making a diagnosis of bone and joint tuberculosis is challenging. As the symptoms are not always typical, a delay in initiating anti-tuberculosis treatment is not uncommon in clinical practice. Systemic features are not always present in multi-drug resistant tuberculosis of joints which makes the diagnosis even more challenging. Multi-drug resistant tuberculosis is an increasingly common problem. It is not only limited to immunocompromised patients, but also found in immunocompetent patients. Multifocal tuberculous osteomyelitis is an uncommon condition and may involve any bone such as the skull, ribs, long bones, spine and phalanx. Tuberculous pyomyositis and tuberculous tenosynovitis may also be the presenting features of multifocal tuberculosis. Identification of mycobacterium tuberculosis in synovial fluid and biopsy, tissue culture, tissue fluid cytology and tissue polymerase chain reaction are crucial investigations in these cases. As the presentation of extra pulmonary tuberculosis can be very variable, it is important to maintain a high index of suspicion. The diagnosis and therefore treatment may be expedited using a clinically directed multidisciplinary approach.
