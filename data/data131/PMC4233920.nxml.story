 monkeys. The injection site locations ranged from 2° to 10° eccentricity in the lower visual field representation of V4. Alternate cortical sections, cut tangentially to the pial surface or in the coronal plane, were stained for CTb immunocytochemistry or for CytOx histochemistry or for Nissl. Our results indicate that the V4-projecting cells and terminal-like labeling were located in interstripes and thin CytOx-rich stripes and avoided the CytOx-rich thick stripes in V2. The feedforward projecting cell bodies in V2 were primarily located in the supragranular layers and sparsely located in the infragranular layers, whereas the feedback projections (i.e., the terminal-like labels) were located in the supra- and infragranular layers. V4 injections of CTb resulted in labeling of the thin stripes and interstripes of V2 and provided an efficient method of distinguishing the V2 modules that were related to the ventral stream from the CytOx-rich thick stripes, related to the dorsal stream. In V2, there was a significant heterogeneity in the distribution of projections: feedforward projections were located in CytOx-rich thin stripes and in the CytOx-poor interstripes, whereas the feedback projections were more abundant in the thin stripes than in the interstripes.
