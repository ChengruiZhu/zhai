Cancer is known to be characterized by several unifying biological capabilities or “hallmarks.” However, attempts to computationally identify patterns, such as gene expression signatures, shared across many different cancer types have been largely unsuccessful. A typical approach has been to classify samples into mutually exclusive subtypes, each of which is characterized by a particular gene signature. Although occasional similarities of such signatures in different cancer types exist, these similarities have not been sufficiently strong to conclude that they reflect the same biological event. By contrast, we have developed a computational methodology that has identified some signatures of co-expressed genes exhibiting remarkable similarity across many different cancer types. These signatures appear as stable “attractors” of an iterative computational procedure that tends to collect mutually associated genes, so that its convergence can point to the core (“heart”) of the underlying biological co-expression mechanism. One of these “pan-cancer” attractors corresponds to a transdifferentiation of cancer cells empowering them with invasiveness and motility. Another represents a mitotic chromosomal instability of cancer cells. A third attractor is lymphocyte-specific.
