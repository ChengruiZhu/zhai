Analysis of anti-Class I major histocompatibility complex (MHC) monoclonal antibodies by immunofluorescence and flow microfluorometry demonstrated an unexpected cross-reactivity. Two of fifteen antibodies examined (20-8-4, anti-Kb,Kd,r,s and 34-1-2, antiKd,Dd,Kb,r,s,q,p) were observed to detect an antigen determined by gene(s) mapping to the right of H-2D. Two-color immunofluorescence analysis demonstrated that this antigen, unlike classical H-2K and D antigens, was expressed in high amounts on peripheral T cells, but only weakly on Ia-positive cells and on small subpopulations of thymus and bone marrow cells. Mapping, absorption, blocking, and tissue distribution studies suggested that the cross-reactive antigen is Qa-like, but distinct from previously described Qa antigens. Thus, these data demonstrate serological cross-reactivity between a Class I MHC antigen and a differentiation antigen determined by genes linked to H-2. It seems likely that the gene responsible for this new antigen is one of the numerous Class I-like sequences detected by DNA hybridization analyses, but previously undefined in terms of tissue expression. These data suggest that many of these DNA sequences may be expressed in specific tissues and that cross-reactions of anti-Class I MAbs may provide useful probes for studying the products of such homologous genes.
