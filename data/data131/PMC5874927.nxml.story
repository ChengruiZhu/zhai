Digital Tomosynthesis (DTS) is an image modality in reconstructing tomographic images from two‐dimensional kV projections covering a narrow scan angles. Comparing with conventional cone‐beam CT (CBCT), it requires less time and radiation dose in data acquisition. It is feasible to apply this technique in patient positioning in radiotherapy. To facilitate its clinical application, a software tool was developed and the reconstruction processes were accelerated by graphic processing unit (GPU). Two reconstruction and two registration processes are required for DTS application which is different from conventional CBCT application which requires one image reconstruction process and one image registration process. The reconstruction stage consists of productions of two types of DTS. One type of DTS is reconstructed from cone‐beam (CB) projections covering a narrow scan angle and is named onboard DTS (ODTS), which represents the real patient position in treatment room. Another type of DTS is reconstructed from digitally reconstructed radiography (DRR) and is named reference DTS (RDTS), which represents the ideal patient position in treatment room. Prior to the reconstruction of RDTS, The DRRs are reconstructed from planning CT using the same acquisition setting of CB projections. The registration stage consists of two matching processes between ODTS and RDTS. The target shift in lateral and longitudinal axes are obtained from the matching between ODTS and RDTS in coronal view, while the target shift in longitudinal and vertical axes are obtained from the matching between ODTS and RDTS in sagittal view. In this software, both DRR and DTS reconstruction algorithms were implemented on GPU environments for acceleration purpose. The comprehensive evaluation of this software tool was performed including geometric accuracy, image quality, registration accuracy, and reconstruction efficiency. The average correlation coefficient between DRR/DTS generated by GPU‐based algorithm and CPU‐based algorithm is 0.99. Based on the measurements of cube phantom on DTS, the geometric errors are within 0.5 mm in three axes. For both cube phantom and pelvic phantom, the registration errors are within 0.5 mm in three axes. Compared with reconstruction performance of CPU‐based algorithms, the performances of DRR and DTS reconstructions are improved by a factor of 15 to 20. A GPU‐based software tool was developed for DTS application for patient positioning of radiotherapy. The geometric and registration accuracy met the clinical requirement in patient setup of radiotherapy. The high performance of DRR and DTS reconstruction algorithms was achieved by the GPU‐based computation environments. It is a useful software tool for researcher and clinician in evaluating DTS application in patient positioning of radiotherapy.
