 probe and five lead electrocardiogram were applied. Anesthesia was induced with midazolam 1mg intravenous (i/v), fentanyl 100 Î¼g i.v, propofol 100mg i/v and vecuronium bromide 5 mg. i/v. At the end of surgery, anesthesia was reversed and breathing attempts were observed. Suddenly the monitor displayed a drop in the ETCO2 to 5-6 mmHg. Immediately the ventilator circuit was checked which was found to be in place and on chest auscultation, bilateral equal air entry was heard. Sudden bradycardia with heart beat dropping to 32 beats per minute and a blood pressure reading of 90/50 mmHg was displayed on the monitor. Surgeons were informed about the possibility of an intra-abdominal bleed. On surgical exploration, the renal artery pedicle ligature was found to have slipped away resulting in torrential amount of bleeding. The bleeder having been identified was secured and a complete inspection of other possible bleeding sites was done. Post operatively, the patient was shifted to the intensive care unit with inotropic support. It was decided to keep the patient mechanically ventilated on volume control mode of ventilation. The patient remained stable on post-operative day 5, the patient was shifted to the ward.
