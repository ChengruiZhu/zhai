The mechanism of the anti-beta-adrenergic action of acetylcholine (ACh) on Ca current, ICa, was examined using the tight-seal, whole-cell voltage clamp technique in single atrial myocytes from the bullfrog. Both isoproterenol (ISO) and forskolin increased ICa dose dependently. After ICa had been enhanced maximally by ISO (10(-6) M), subsequent application of forskolin (50 microM) did not further increase ICa, suggesting that ISO and forskolin increase ICa via a common biochemical pathway, possibly by stimulation of adenylate cyclase. ACh (10(-5) M) completely inhibited the effect of low doses of forskolin (2 x 10(-6) M), as well as ISO, but it failed to block the effects of high doses of forskolin (greater than 5 x 10(-5) M). Intracellular application of cyclic AMP (cAMP) also increased ICa. ACh (10(-5) M) failed to inhibit this cAMP effect, indicating that the inhibitory action of ACh occurs at a site proximal to the production of cAMP. ACh (10(-5) M) also activated an inwardly rectifying K+ current IK(ACh). Intracellular application of a nonhydrolyzable GTP analogue, GTP gamma S (5 X 10(-4) M), activated IK(ACh) within several minutes; subsequent application of ACh (10(-5) M) did not increase IK(ACh) further. These results demonstrate that a GTP-binding protein coupled to these K+ channels can be activated maximally by GTP gamma S even in the absence of ACh. Intracellular application of GTP gamma S also strongly inhibited the effect of ISO on ICa in the absence of ACh. Pertussis toxin (IAP) completely prevented both the inhibitory effect of ACh on ICa and the ACh-induced activation of IK(ACh). GTP gamma S (50 microM-1 mM) alone did not increase ICa significantly; however, when ISO was applied first, GTP gamma S (5 x 10(-4) M) gradually inhibited the ISO effect on ICa. These results indicate that ACh antagonizes the effect of ISO on ICa via a GTP-binding protein (Gi and/or Go). This effect may be mediated through a direct inhibition by the alpha-subunit of Gi which is coupled to the adenylate cyclase.
