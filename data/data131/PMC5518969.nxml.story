Oral clefts, the most frequent congenital birth defects in humans, are multifactorial disorders caused by genetic and environmental factors. Epidemiological studies point to different etiologies underlying the oral cleft phenotypes, cleft lip (CL), CL and/or palate (CL/P) and cleft palate (CP). More than 350 genes have syndromic and/or nonsyndromic oral cleft associations in humans. Although genes related to genetic disorders associated with oral cleft phenotypes are known, a gap between detecting these associations and interpretation of their biological importance has remained. Here, using a gene ontology analysis approach, we grouped these candidate genes on the basis of different functional categories to gain insight into the genetic etiology of oral clefts. We identified different genetic profiles and found correlations between the functions of gene products and oral cleft phenotypes. Our results indicate inherent differences in the genetic etiologies that underlie oral cleft phenotypes and support epidemiological evidence that genes associated with CL/P are both developmentally and genetically different from CP only, incomplete CP, and submucous CP. The epidemiological differences among cleft phenotypes may reflect differences in the underlying genetic causes. Understanding the different causative etiologies of oral clefts is important as it may lead to improvements in diagnosis, counseling, and prevention.
