Histone deacetylase 3 (HDAC3) has been recently identified as a potential target for the treatment of cancer and other diseases, such as chronic inflammation, neurodegenerative diseases, and diabetes. Virtual screening (VS) is currently a routine technique for hit identification, but its success depends on rational development of VS strategies. To facilitate this process, we applied our previously released benchmarking dataset, i.e., MUBD-HDAC3 to the evaluation of structure-based VS (SBVS) and ligand-based VS (LBVS) combinatorial approaches. We have identified FRED (Chemgauss4) docking against a structural model of HDAC3, i.e., SAHA-3 generated by a computationally inexpensive “flexible docking”, as the best SBVS approach and a common feature pharmacophore model, i.e., Hypo1 generated by Catalyst/HipHop as the optimal model for LBVS. We then developed a pipeline that was composed of Hypo1, FRED (Chemgauss4), and SAHA-3 sequentially, and demonstrated that it was superior to other combinations in terms of ligand enrichment. In summary, we present the first highly-validated, rationally-designed VS strategy specific to HDAC3 inhibitor discovery. The constructed pipeline is publicly accessible for the scientific community to identify novel HDAC3 inhibitors in a time-efficient and cost-effective way.
