The disruption of normal brain organization in humans is believed to underlie a number of behavioral conditions, such as autism spectrum disorders (ASD) and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). To gain insight into how normal brain organization develops, we mapped functional brain connectivity in children and young adults, and used a network analysis to characterize and compare the organization of brain networks. Comparison of network properties revealed that while children and young adults' brains have similar organization at the global level, there were several key differences in connectivity. For example, children's brains had less of a hierarchical organization than young-adults. Most importantly, we show that the dynamic process of over-connectivity followed by pruning, which rewires connectivity at the neuronal level, also operates at the systems level, reconfiguring and rebalancing subcortical and paralimbic connectivity in the developing brain. Our findings demonstrate the utility of using network analyses of multimodal brain connectivity to study maturation of brain circuits, and suggest new avenues for future research on neurodevelopmental disorders such as ASD and ADHD.
