A flow cytometric phenotype for isolated adult central nervous system (CNS) ramified microglia was previously defined (CD45low CD11b/c+) in the Lewis strain rat, that clearly distinguished these cells from all blood-derived leucocytes, the latter being CD45high. Consistent with the reported lack of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) expression in the CNS, isolated microglia were mostly MHC class II-. Employing these phenotypic criteria, we now show that a proportion of microglia in Brown Norway (BN) strain rats are constitutively MHC class II+. In spinal cord, up to 25% of microglia are distinctly positive and most have some level of expression. In situ staining of MHC class II+ microglial cells in BN rats indicates that positive cells are typical of ramified microglia on the grounds of both morphological appearance and anatomical location. In Lewis (LEW) rats, the few MHC class II- expressing cells isolated from the normal CNS are CD45high blood- derived cells and not resident microglia. After infection of both LEW and BN rats with a neurotropic murine hepatitis virus (MHV-JHM), MHC class II was rapidly upregulated on microglia in the BN but not in the LEW strain. In the latter, inflammatory cells were the predominant MHC class II-expressing population. Nevertheless, most microglia in the LEW strain could, after some delay, be induced to express MHC class II after transfer of an experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE)- inducing encephalitogenic T cell line. Paradoxically, strains resistant to EAE (exemplified by the BN) contained more constitutive MHC class II- expressing microglia than susceptible ones, when a variety of strains were examined. The results clearly establish that the normal CNS may contain MHC class II-expressing cells that are a resident rather than a transient blood-derived population. It is significant that this expression is strain related, but there is no evidence that microglial cell constitutive MHC class II expression predisposes to EAE susceptibility.
