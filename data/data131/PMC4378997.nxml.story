Separases are a family of cysteine proteases found in organisms ranging from yeast to humans that are required for separation of chromosomes during cell division. Separases dissolve the cohesin ring-like complex that holds sister chromatids together until chromosome separation occurs during mitosis. We used two genetic screens in the model organism budding yeast to identify additional cellular roles for separase. Surprisingly, we found that yeast separase is required for insertion of Ty1 retrotransposons into the yeast genome. Ty1 retrotransposons, or elements, are similar in their life cycle to retroviruses such as the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) which is the cause of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). The insertion of retroviral/retrotransposon DNA into the genome requires a conserved protein encoded by the virus/retrotransposon called integrase. Until now, it was unknown which yeast host protein interacted with Ty1 integrase. We found that yeast separase interacts with Ty1 integrase, and that separase may be required for targeting Ty1 integrase into the genome via its interaction with integrase and by removing cohesin from the chromosomes. Due to the conservation of Ty1 integrase with other viral integrases, our discovery may shed light on how other viral integrases are targeted into the genome.
