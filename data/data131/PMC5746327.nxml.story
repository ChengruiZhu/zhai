The aim of the present study was to quantify calprotectin levels using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and a point-of-care test (POCT) in patients with inflammatory bowel disease. Overall, 113 patients with ulcerative colitis (UC; 51 men and 62 women) and 42 patients with Crohn's disease (CD; 29 men and 13 women), who were scheduled to undergo a colonoscopy, were prospectively enrolled and scored endoscopically and clinically. An additional 96 healthy, age-matched subjects served as the normal controls. Feces and blood samples from the patients with UC and CD, and the normal controls were analyzed. These patients had received adequate medical treatment. The tissue distribution of calprotectin was investigated using immunohistochemistry. The fecal calprotectin levels, as measured using an ELISA, were correlated with the endoscopic and clinical disease activities and laboratory parameters, including serum levels of hemoglobin (Hb), albumin and C-reactive protein, and erythrocyte sedimentation rate, particularly among the patients with UC. The fecal Hb level was close to that of the fecal calprotectin level (r=0.57; P<0.0001). The fecal calprotectin level measured using an ELISA was well-correlated with the fecal calprotectin level measured using the POCT (r=0.81; P<0.0001), but was not correlated with the serum calprotectin level (r=0.1013; P=0.47). An immunohistochemical investigation revealed that patients with both UC and CD had higher neutrophil and monocyte/macrophage calprotectin-positive cell expression levels, compared with those in the normal controls. Fecal calprotectin was considered a reliable marker for disease activity, and the assessment of fecal calprotectin via POCT showed potential as a rapid and simple measurement in clinical settings.
