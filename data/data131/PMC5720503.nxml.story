 dose delivered during radiotherapy, as well as to localize the target volume. This potential, as well as the detectors' ability to relate dosimetry and localization, were evaluated using two implantable MOSFET dosimeters placed inside an acrylic pelvic phantom. A wedged‐field photon plan and an eight‐field prostate treatment plan were developed. For each plan, conditions were simulated so that detectors were in their correct positions or slightly displaced to represent patient setup error and/or organ motion. Doses measured by the two detectors after irradiation were compared to those calculated by the treatment planning software. Additionally, using localization software and kilovoltage images of each setup, the displacement of the detectors from their correct locations was calculated and compared to the induced physical displacement. For all alignments and detector positions, measured and calculated doses showed an average disagreement of 2.7%. The detectors were easily visualized radiographically and the induced detector displacements were typically recognized by the localization software to within 0.1 cm. The implantable detector functioned well as both an internal dosimeter and as an internal fiducial marker, and thus may be useful as a clinical tool to localize the target volume and verify dose delivery
