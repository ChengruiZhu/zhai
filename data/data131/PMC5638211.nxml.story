Proteins physically associate into complexes in order to carry out the essential functions of life. Knowing how proteins are physically arranged three dimensionally in these complexes provides clues towards how they work. In principle, the associations between proteins in large-scale proteomics datasets should often reflect direct physical contacts between proteins in each complex. Here, we describe a statistical method to discover which subunits within complexes directly contact each other based on their co-purification behavior in published co-fractionation mass spectrometry datasets. Within our predictions, we recover many known protein-protein contacts, serving to validate our method, as well as unknown contacts that can inform future studies of these complexes. Specifically, we observe confident contacts between subunits within the exocyst and tRNA multi-synthetase complexes, two complexes that have incomplete structural information. Using our method, we further provide structural information for a previously missing subunit of the EKC/KEOPS complex. We anticipate that this method and the associated predictions will help to better inform our understanding of the functions and structures of diverse protein complexes.
