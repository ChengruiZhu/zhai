αB-crystallin is a small heat shock protein, which has pro-angiogenic properties by increasing survival of endothelial cells and secretion of vascular endothelial growth factor A. Here we demonstrate an additional role of αB-crystallin in regulating vascular function, through enhancing tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α) induced expression of endothelial adhesion molecules involved in leukocyte recruitment. Ectopic expression of αB-crystallin in endothelial cells increases the level of E-selectin expression in response to TNF-α, and enhances leukocyte–endothelial interaction in vitro. Conversely, TNF-α-induced expression of intercellular adhesion molecule 1, vascular cell adhesion molecule 1 and E-selectin is markedly inhibited in endothelial cells isolated from αB-crystallin-deficient mice. This is associated with elevated levels of IκB in αB-crystallin deficient cells and incomplete degradation upon TNF-α stimulation. Consistent with this, endothelial adhesion molecule expression is reduced in inflamed vessels of αB-crystallin deficient mice, and leukocyte rolling velocity is increased. Our data identify αB-crystallin as a new regulator of leukocyte recruitment, by enhancing pro-inflammatory nuclear factor κ B-signaling and endothelial adhesion molecule expression during endothelial activation.
