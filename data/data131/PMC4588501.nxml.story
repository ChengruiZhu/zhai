Tumorigenesis is a multistep process, de-regulated due to the imbalance of oncogenes as well as anti-oncogenes, resulting in disruption of tissue homeostasis. In many cases the effect of oncogenes and anti-oncogenes are mediated by various other molecules such as microRNAs. microRNAs are small non-coding RNAs established to post-transcriptionally regulate more than half of the protein coding genes. miR cluster 143/145 is one such cancer-related microRNA cluster which is down-regulated in most of the cancers and is able to hinder tumorigenesis by targeting tumor-associated genes. The fact that they could sensitize drug-resistant cancer cells by targeting multidrug resistant genes makes them potent tools to target cancer cells. Their low levels precede events which lead to cancer progression and therefore could be considered also as biomarkers to stage the disease. Interestingly, evidence suggests the existence of several in vivo mechanisms by which this cluster is differentially regulated at the molecular level to keep their levels low in cancer. In this review, we summarize the roles of miR cluster 143/145 in cancer, their potential prognostic applications and also their regulation during tumorigenesis.
