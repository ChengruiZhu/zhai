I-CMICE-013) based on rotenone and showed that it has excellent performance as a radiotracer for myocardial perfusion imaging. Here, we describe the cellular toxicity and subacute toxicity of CMICE-013 in rats. Cultured hepatocytes displayed sensitivity to rotenone but not CMICE-013 at equimolar concentrations. Following i.v. injection of CMICE-013 for 14 days, body weight, ambulation, behavior, grooming, guarding (abdominal, muscular), pale conjunctivae, and food intake were observed. Biochemical, hematological, and histopathological changes in tissues (heart, liver, kidney, spleen, lung, and brain) and echocardiography at pre- and post-dosing were also examined. All animals responded well to the daily injections of CMICE-013 and showed no mortality or adverse reactions with respect to the parameters above. Subacute i.v. injections at high- (5 μg/kg) and low (1 μg/kg)-dose levels did not result in any significant changes to either biochemical or hematological parameters and no detectable changes in histopathology compared to the vehicle or untreated animals. Echocardiographic analyses, including the measurements of cardiac function and anatomy (wall thickness, left atrial size, and left ventricular mass), were not different at pre- versus post-dose measures and were not different compared to the vehicle or untreated animals. Our observations in small animals reveal that CMICE-013 induces minimal toxicity when delivered intravenously for 14 days.
