Induction of T cell antigen receptor (TCR) endocytosis has a significant impact on TCR signaling and T cell behavior, but the molecular interactions coordinating internalization of the activated TCR are poorly understood. Previously we have shown that TCR endocytosis is regulated by the Wiskott Aldrich Syndrome protein (WASp), a cytosolic effector which, upon interaction with the cdc42 Rho GTPase, couples TCR engagement to Arp 2/3 complex-mediated actin polymerization. Here we report that WASp associates in T cells with intersectin 2, an endocytic adaptor containing multiple domains including a Dbl homology (DH) domain with the potential to activate Rho GTPases. Intersectin 2 association with WASp increases after TCR engagement, and its overexpression in Cos-7 cells induces WASp translocation to endocytic vesicles within which intersectin 2 colocalizes with both WASp and cdc42. Intersectin 2, but not a DH domain-deleted (Î”DH) form of intersectin 2, and stimulation via the TCR also trigger the activation of cdc42. Induction of TCR internalization is also augmented by intersectin 2 and severely impaired by latrunculin B treatment. Thus, intersection 2 appears to function cooperatively with WASp and cdc42 to link the clathrin endocytic machinery to WASp-mediated actin polymerization and ultimately to occupancy-induced TCR endocytosis.
