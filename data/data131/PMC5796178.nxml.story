Lack of effectiveness of radiation therapy may arise from different factors such as radiation induced receptor tyrosine kinase activation and cell repopulation; cell capability to repair radiation induced DNA damage; high grade glioma (HGG) tumous heterogeneity, etc. In this study, we analyzed the potential of targeting epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) in inducing radiosensitivity in two human HGG cell lines (11 and 15) that displayed similar growth patterns and expressed the receptor protein at the cell surface. We found that 15 HGG cells that express more EGFR at the cell surface were more sensitive to AG556 (an EGFR inhibitor), compared to 11 HGG cells. Although in line 15 the effect of the inhibitor was greater than in line 11, it should be noted that the efficacy of this small-molecule EGFR inhibitor as monotherapy in both cell lines has been modest, at best. Our data showed a slight difference in the response to radiation of the HGG cell lines, three days after the treatment, with line 15 responding better than line 11. However, both cell lines responded to ionizing radiation in the same way, seven days after irradiation. EGFR inhibition induced radiosensitivity in 11 HGG cells, while, in 15 HGG cells, the effect of AG556 treatment on radiation response was almost nonexistent.
