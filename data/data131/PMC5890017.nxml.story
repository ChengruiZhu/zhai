Cimetidine is an H2 receptor antagonist that has an antiandrogenic effect. It intervenes with the conversion of testosterone into estrogen in the Sertoli cells with accompanying testicular structural changes. In the present study, the microscopic and the ultrastructural changes induced by cimetidine and the effect of vitamin B12 as a protective agent on rat testes were studied. Immunoexpression of estrogen receptor β (ERβ) in testes was evaluated. Twenty-four adult male rats were divided into four groups: control, cimetidine-treated, vitamin B12 treated, and combined cimetidine and vitamin B12 treated. The experimental rats were administered with cimetidine and/or vitamin B12 for 52 days. Group II rats showed marked atrophy of the seminiferous tubules with a significant increase in tubular diameter and decrease in the tubular luminal and epithelial areas. Ultrastructure of this group showed irregular Sertoli cells with basal cytoplasmic vacuolation and significantly thickened basement membrane. ERβ immunoexpression was similar to controls. Group III rats showed near normal seminiferous tubular structures with minimal cellular alterations and the immunoreactivity of the testicular sections was very close to normal. However, group IV rats showed markedly immunopositive detached cells, spermatids, and primary spermatocytes. Cimetidine interferes with the control of spermatogenesis as evidenced by microscopic and ultrastructural studies and affection of ERβ receptors and vitamin B12 has a protective action against this harmful effect.
