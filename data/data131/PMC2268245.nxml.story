For reasons that are still unclear, genetic defects in DNA repair can cause diseases that resemble aspects of premature ageing (“segmental progerias”). Cockayne syndrome (CS) is a particularly devastating progeria most commonly caused by mutations in the CSB chromatin remodeling gene. About 43 million years ago, before humans diverged from marmosets, one of the last PiggyBac transposable elements to invade the human lineage landed within intron 5 of the 21 exon CSB gene. As a result, the CSB locus now encodes two equally abundant proteins generated by alternative mRNA splicing: the original full length CSB protein, and a novel CSB-PiggyBac fusion protein in which the N-terminus of CSB is fused to the complete PiggyBac transposase. Conservation of the CSB-PiggyBac fusion protein since marmoset suggests that it is normally beneficial, demonstrating once again that “selfish” transposable elements can be exploited or “domesticated” by the host. More importantly, almost all CSB mutations that cause CS continue to make the CSB-PiggyBac fusion protein, whereas a mutation that compromises both does not cause CS. Thus the fusion protein which is beneficial in the presence of functional CSB may be harmful in its absence. This may help clarify the cause of CS and other progerias.
