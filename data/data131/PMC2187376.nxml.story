Macrophages are active secretory cells that display functionally distinct phenotypes that are regulated by inflammation. We have found that apoprotein E (ApoE), a component of plasma lipoproteins, was synthesized and secreted by resident and nonspecifically stimulated macrophages elicited with thioglycollate broth, but not by activated macrophages obtained from mice treated with bacillus Calmette-Guerin, pyran copolymer, whole Corynebacterium parvum, or bacterial endotoxin. ApoE represented approximately 1% of the newly synthesized protein and approximately 10% of secreted protein of resident and thioglycollate- elicited macrophages. ApoE from thioglycollate-elicited macrophages was indistinguishable from ApoE in mouse plasma lipoproteins, as determined by immunoreactivity, peptide mapping, and molecular weight. When specific antibodies were used to localize cell-associated ApoE, strong immunofluorescence was seen in the Golgi region of resident and thioglycollate-elicited macrophages immediately after removal from the peritoneal cavity, as well as after culture for up to 7 d. In contrast, activated macrophages did not synthesize or secrete ApoE to an appreciable extent and had no immunocytochemically detectable intracellular ApoE. When activated macrophages were cultured in medium containing serum, their activated state, as judged by production of H2O2, declined within 48-72 h in parallel with the induction of synthesis and secretion of ApoE and detection of intracellular ApoE by immunofluorescence. During prolonged culture the rate of synthesis and secretion of ApoE increased in both resident and activated macrophages. Therefore, the synthesis and secretion of ApoE may serve as markers for the functional state of macrophages.
