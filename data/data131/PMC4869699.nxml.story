Fifty-eight patients were enrolled; at 2 years, 35 assigned to ATG and 16 to placebo completed the study. The pre-specified endpoints were not met. In post hoc analyses, older patients (age 22–35 years) in the ATG group had significantly greater C-peptide AUCs at 24 months than placebo patients. Using complete preservation of baseline C-peptide at 24 months as threshold, nine of 35 ATG-treated participants (vs 2/16 placebo participants) were classified as responders; nine of 11 responders (67%) were older. All participants reported at least one adverse event (AE), with 1,148 events in the 38 ATG participants vs 415 in the 20 placebo participants; a comparable number of infections were noted in the ATG and placebo groups, with no opportunistic infections nor difficulty clearing infections in either group. Circulating T cell subsets depleted by ATG partially reconstituted, but regulatory, naive and central memory subsets remained significantly depleted at 24 months. Beta cell autoantibodies did not change over the 24 months in the ATG-treated or placebo participants. At 12 months, ATG-treated participants had similar humoral immune responses to tetanus and HepA vaccines as placebo-treated participants, and no increased infections.
