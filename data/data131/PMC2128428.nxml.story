. With pneumococcus it has been previously shown that prompt and luxuriant growth will occur in broth containing unheated potato even though the seeding be so small that no growth whatever will occur with the same seeding in plain broth (5). In the present study it has been shown that even in dextrose broth this minimal inoculation is followed by a prolonged period of lag, whereas in potato broth this same inoculum serves to initiate immediate and rapid growth. When pneumococci are grown in potato broth not only is the period of lag abolished, but the stationary period of growth is extended and cell death is delayed. Moreover, in plant tissue medium the zone of hydrogen ion concentration within which growth of pneumococcus can be initiated is considerably extended beyond the acid and alkaline limits of the optimal range in ordinary bouillon. It has been found also that the presence of unheated plant tissue in the media likewise stimulates growth of hemolytic and non-hemolytic streptococci. In this investigation no attempt has been made to determine the exact nature of the substances in plant tissue upon which these properties depend. That they are not of the nature of readily fermentable carbohydrates, however, is made evident by the fact that no increased production of acid occurs in the pneumococcus culture when potato is present.
