 complex. It is manifested by a variety of clinical symptoms and affects skin, joints, heart, and nervous system. Neurological manifestations are predictable and usually include meningoencephalitis, facial palsy, or radiculopathy. Recently, a dramatic rise in the number of diagnosed cases of LB has been observed on the global level. Here we show the first case of Lyme neuroborreliosis in southern Bosnia and Herzegovina, which was first presented by erythema chronicum migrans. Unfortunately, it was not recognized or well treated at the primary care medicine. After eight weeks, the patient experienced headache, right facial palsy, and lumbar radiculopathy. After the clinical examination, the neurologist suspected meningoencephalitis and the patient was directed to the Clinic for Infectious Disease of the University Hospital Mostar, where he was admitted. The successful antimicrobial treatment with the 21-day course of ceftriaxone was followed by normalization of neurological status, and then he was discharged from the hospital. This case report represents an alert to all physicians to be aware that LB is present in all parts of Bosnia and Herzegovina, as well as in the neighboring regions.
