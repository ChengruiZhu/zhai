Drug combinations represent a promising strategy for overcoming fungal drug resistance and treating complex diseases. There is an urgent need to establish powerful computational methods for systematic prediction of synergistic drug combination on a large scale. Based on the assumption that principal drugs which obtain synergistic effect with similar adjuvant drugs are often similar and vice versa, NLLSS was developed to predict potential synergistic drug combinations by integrating known synergistic drug combinations, unlabeled drug combinations, drug-target interactions, and drug chemical structures. NLLSS has obtained the reliable performance in the cross validation and experimental validations, which indicated that NLLSS has an excellent performance of identifying potential synergistic drug combinations. Out of 13 predicted antifungal synergistic drug combinations, 7 candidates were experimentally confirmed. It is anticipated that NLLSS would be an important and useful resource by providing a new strategy to identify potential synergistic antifungal combinations, explore new indications of existing drugs, and provide useful insights into the underlying molecular mechanisms of synergistic drug combinations.
