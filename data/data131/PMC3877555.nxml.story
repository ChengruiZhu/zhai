Chemotherapy remains the common therapeutic for patients with lung cancer. Novel, selective antitumor agents are pressingly needed. This study is the first to investigate a different, however, effective antitumor drug candidate Wentilactone A (WA) for its development as a novel agent. In NCI-H460 and NCI-H446 cell lines, WA triggered G2/M phase arrest and mitochondrial-related apoptosis, accompanying the accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS). It also induced activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase and p53 and increased expression of p21. When we pre-treated cells with ERK, JNK, p38, p53 inhibitor or NAC followed by WA treatment, only ERK and p53 inhibitors blocked WA-induced apoptosis and G2/M arrest. We further observed Ras (HRas, KRas and NRas) and Raf activation, and found that WA treatment increased HRasâ€“Raf activation. Knockdown of HRas by using small interfering RNA (siRNA) abolished WA-induced apoptosis and G2/M arrest. HRas siRNA also halted Raf, ERK, p53 activation and p21 accumulation. Molecular docking analysis suggested that WA could bind to HRas-GTP, causing accumulation of Ras-GTP and excessive activation of Raf/ERK/p53-p21. The direct binding affinity was confirmed by surface plasmon resonance (SPR).
