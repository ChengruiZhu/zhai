The self-association of peptides and proteins plays an important role in many serious diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease. A complete understanding of how peptides and proteins self-associate is important in creating therapeutics for such diseases. Additionally, self-associating peptides can be used as templates for bioinspired nanomaterials. With these goals in mind, we have proposed a de novo peptide design methodology capable of producing peptides that self-associate. We have experimentally tested the framework through the design of several self-associating tripeptides. Using the framework we designed six self-associating peptides, including two peptides, Ac-MYD and Ac-VIE, which readily formed hydrogels and one peptide, Ac-YLD, which readily formed a crystal. An X-ray crystallographic study was performed on Ac-YLD to determine its crystal structure. The top-ranked designed sequences were shuffled and computationally and experimentally characterized in order to validate that the approach can differentiate the self-associating of tripeptides, which are derived from the same amino acids. Through the analysis of the experimental results we determine which metrics are most important in the self-association of peptides. Additionally, the crystallographic structure of the tripeptide Ac-YLD provides a structural template for future self-association design experiments.
