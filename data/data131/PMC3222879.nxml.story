Results: Exercise caused a decrease in Lif mRNA expression in wild-type muscle, but this was not the case in mdx muscle. Lif mRNA levels in sedentary mdx mice were similar to those in exercised wild type muscles, and in mdx mice there was no further decrease in levels following exercise. Similar down-regulation of Lif mRNA was observed in the tibialis anterior and diaphragm muscles of mdx mice at three and six weeks of age respectively, compared with wild-type controls. Transcripts for the LIF receptor (Lifr) were also down-regulated in these mdx muscles, suggesting LIF activity may be minimised in dystrophic muscle. However fluorescent immunohistochemical labeling of LIF did not correlate with transcript expression data, as LIF immunoreactivity could not be detected in wild-type muscle, where mRNA expression was high, but was present in dystrophic muscle where mRNA expression was low. This study also described the translocation of membrane proteins, including LIFR, to the nuclei of syncytial muscle cells during differentiation and fusion. In addition this study demonstrates that survival of donor myoblasts injected into dystrophic muscle was enhanced by co-administration of recombinant LIF.
