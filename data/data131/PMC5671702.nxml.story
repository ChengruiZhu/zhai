Endobronchial ultrasound-guided transbronchial needle aspiration (EBUS-TBNA) has increasingly been performed for the diagnosis and staging of thoracic malignancies. Findings of a necrotic lymph node raise concern for infectious process and malignancy. A hypoechoic area on ultrasound/EBUS within a lymph node without blood flow is suggestive of pathologies like infections or malignancy. Inspection of the fluid could suggest a diagnosis; clear aspirates usually suggest bronchogenic or mediastinal cysts and purulent material suggests abscesses or necrotic lymph nodes. Growing tumor cells require a blood supply; if the vascular stroma is insufficient due to rapidly growing malignant tumors this could lead to large central areas of ischemic necrosis. Necrotic aspiration of lymph nodes is not always of infectious etiology. Aspiration of fluid in EBUS-TBNA is a rare occurrence, and malignancy should be considered when purulent fluid material is obtained. We present an elderly woman who underwent bronchoscopy with EBUS-TBNA for evaluation of upper lung nodule and mediastinal lymphadenopathy. Pus-like material was obtained on needle aspiration and endobronchial biopsy and mediastinal core biopsy revealed squamous cell carcinoma.
