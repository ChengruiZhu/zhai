Katz et al. (1) have demonstrated a restriction in lymphoid cell interaction when the antigen used is under immune response (Ir) gene control. T cells from (low responder x high responder) F(1) mice primed to the terpolymer L-glutamic acid, L-lysine, L-tyrosine (GLT) can collaborate with 2,4-dinitrophenyl (DNP)-primed B cells from the Ir-GLT high responder but not low responder strain in response to DNP-GLT (1). In contrast are the studies of Bechtol et al. and Bechtol and McDevitt (2,3), who examined the antibody responses of tetraparental mice immunized with the synthetic polypeptide poly-L(Tyr,Glu)-poly D,L-Ala- poly-L-Lys ((T,G)-A-L), an antigen under Ir-1A genetic control. Several tetraparental mice produced anti(T-,G)-A-L antibody of low responder strain immunoglobulin (Ig) allotype (2,3). These results indicated that he Ir-1A gene was not expressed in B cells and implied that interactions among genetically dissimilar cell populations could occur when tolerance existed to H-2 antigenic differences. Recent studies with bone marrow cell chimeric mice have shown that chimeric T cells can interact with H-2 histoincompatible B cells in response to antigens not under Ir gene control (4-6). To clarify whether lymphoid cell chimerism, with presumed tolerance to H-2 incompatibility, would permit effective cell interactions in response to antigens under Ir gene control, bone marrow cell chimeric mice were prepared by using strains differing both for Ig allotype and for high versus low responsiveness to (T,G)-A-L. An antigen-specific and allotype- specific antibody assay was used to discriminate the responses produced by high and low responder strain B cells in these chimeras. The results suggest that lymphoid cell chimerism per se is not sufficient to obviate Ir gene-mediated restriction in cell interaction.
