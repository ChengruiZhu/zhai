= 6): control and amosite group received initially two intratracheal instillations of saline and amosite solution, respectively. Smoking group was subjected to standardized daily exposure to tobacco smoke for 2 hrs in a concentration resembling human passive smoking. Combined group was exposed to both amosite and cigarette smoke. All rats were killed after 6 months. Rats exposed to either amosite or passive smoking developed significant glomerulosclerosis and tubulointerstitial fibrosis. Combination of both exposures had additive effects. Histomorphological changes preceded the clinical manifestation of kidney damage. In both groups with single exposures, marked perivascular and interstitial cardiac fibrosis was detected. The additive effect in the heart was less pronounced than in the kidney, apparent particularly in changes of vascular structure. Advanced oxidation protein products, the plasma marker of the myeloperoxidase reaction in activated monocytes/macrophages, were increased in all exposed groups, whereas the inflammatory cytokines did not differ between the groups. In rats, passive smoking or amosite instillation leads to renal, vascular and cardiac fibrosis potentially mediated
