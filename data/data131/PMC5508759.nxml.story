Advances in medical, interventional and surgical treatment have increased average life expectancy of patients with congenital heart defects. As a result a new group of adult patients with congenital cardiac defects requires medical rehabilitation. Patients with Marfan syndrome (MFS) are a relevant group among these patients. So far, no reports on the effectiveness of specialized rehabilitation programmes for MFS patients exist. We implemented an inpatient 3-week rehabilitation program for MFS patients at the Muehlenberg-Clinic for rehabilitation and assessed the medical safety as well as the impact of the program on physical fitness and psychological wellbeing of participants by means of an observational pilot study. The comprehensive multidisciplinary program included medical, physiotherapeutic, psychological and social issues. Two groups including 8 and 10 individuals with verified MFS attended the programme. Medically adverse events that occurred during the rehabilitation were registered. Adverse events were defined as: any new cardiac arrhythmias such as atrial fibrillation, ventricular tachycardia, cardiac syncope or any complications located at the aorta. Psychological assessment was performed using Short Form-36 (SF-36), hospital anxiety and depression scale and other psychometric questionnaires. Medical examinations included assessment of maximum power in bicycle ergometry. All assessments were performed at the beginning and at the end of the rehabilitation. Psychometric assessments were repeated 1Â year after the end of the programme for both groups, respectively.
