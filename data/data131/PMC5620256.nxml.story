Meningiomas are the most common tumors of the central nervous system, where the incidence is around 25% of all primary brain tumors. The optimal treatment is represented by total resection accompanied by the removal of the dura mater and bone when infiltrated by the tumor. The histological grading is the most important prognostic factor in the outcome. However, recurrences do occur in a significant proportion (10â€“25%) of cases, representing the most relevant clinical complication. Molecular therapies are providing to give different opportunities in the development of new treatments. The Dickkopf-related family of proteins includes four secretory proteins. The expression of the REIC/Dkk-3 gene is down-regulated in many tumor cell lines and could contribute to the immunomodulatory properties of the tissue microenvironment. An important role in carcinogenesis is played by Dickkopf protein-related protein 3, which is involved in embryonic development through its interaction and modulation of the pathway of the Wnt signal transduction. The mutations of this pathway are of clinical importance, because they lead to the onset of several cancers, including brain tumors, being also involved in tumor angiogenesis. The claudin-5, is an integral membrane protein, which regulate the permeability of the blood-brain barrier. In various pathological processes, including inflammation, trauma and tumor, claudin 5 regulate the change in endothelial or epithelial permeability, therefore, modification in claudin-5 expression may play a role in malignant transformation. The aim of our study is to demonstrate the role of Dkk-3 and claudin-5 in the pathogenesis of meningiomas. A more correct identification of the role of these proteins might suggest interesting and new molecular targets for future therapeutic protocols.
