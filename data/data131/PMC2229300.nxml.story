In a companion paper (Zhao, H., and S. Muallem. 1995), we describe the relationship between the major Na+,K+, and Cl- transporters in resting pancreatic acinar cells. The present study evaluated the role of the different transporters in regulating [Na+]i and electrolyte secretion during agonist stimulation. Cell stimulation increased [Na+]i and 86Rb influx in an agonist-specific manner. Ca(2+)-mobilizing agonists, such as carbachol and cholecystokinin, activated Na+ influx by a tetraethylammonium-sensitive channel and the Na+/H+ exchanger to rapidly increase [Na+]i from approximately 11.7 mM to between 34 and 39 mM. As a consequence, the NaK2Cl cotransporter was largely inhibited and the activity of the Na+ pump increased to mediate most of the 86Rb(K+) uptake into the cells. Secretin, which increases cAMP, activated the NaK2Cl cotransporter and the Na+/H+ exchanger to slowly increase [Na+]i from approximately 11.7 mM to an average of 24.6 mM. Accordingly, secretin increased total 86Rb uptake more than the Ca(2+)- mobilizing agonists and the apparent coupling between the NaK2Cl cotransport and the Na+ pump. All the effects of secretin could be attributed to an increase in cAMP, since forskolin affected [Na+]i and 86Rb fluxes similar to secretin. The signaling pathways mediating the effects of the Ca(2+)-mobilizing agonists were less clear. Although an increase in [Ca2+]i was required, it was not sufficient to account for the effect of the agonists. Activation of protein kinase C stimulated the NaK2Cl cotransporter to increase [Na+]i and 86Rb fluxes without preventing the inhibition of the cotransporter by Ca(2+)-mobilizing agonists. The effects of the agonists were not mediated by changes in cell volume, since cell swelling and shrinkage did not reproduce the effect of the agonists on [Na+]i and 86Rb fluxes. The overall findings of the relationships between the various Na+,K+, and Cl- transporters in resting and stimulated pancreatic acinar cells are discussed in terms of possible models of fluid and electrolyte secretion by these cells.
