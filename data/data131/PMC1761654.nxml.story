Projecting neurons of the striatum are a crucial relay of the basal ganglia, involved in motor, psychomotor, and behavioural functions. Their importance is emphasised by their involvement in various dysfunctions, such as Huntington chorea and schizophrenia, but also drug addiction. The main inputs to those neurons come from cortical glutamatergic terminals. Dopamine modulates this transmission, providing a measure of the internal (hedonic) state. In mammal brain, DARPP-32, a protein phosphatase inhibitor, has been identified as a major target for both dopamine and glutamate signalling. The authors present a detailed quantitative model of the regulation of DARPP-32 phosphorylation and dephosphorylation by both signals. Dynamic simulations show that the function of DARPP-32 depends on the delay between the two signals, and therefore the protein not only measures the intensity, but also the coincidence, between signals. This measurement is insensitive to many parameters, whether kinetic constants or concentrations, making it a robust integrator. This shows that a proper understanding of signal integration in the basal ganglia requires quantitative descriptions of the signalling pathways in addition to the neuronal electrophysiological properties.
