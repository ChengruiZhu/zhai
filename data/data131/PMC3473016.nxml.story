Angiogenesis—the growth of blood vessels—is essential for organ growth and repair, but also occurs during tumorigenesis and in certain inflammatory disorders. All blood vessels are lined by endothelial cells (ECs)—thin, flattened cells that form a continuous monolayer throughout the entire circulatory system. The cellular origin of new vascular ECs during blood vessel growth in angiogenic situations in adults is a matter of debate. New ECs could develop, in principle, from as yet undiscovered stem cells, as is well documented for the differentiated cells of skin or epithelia, or by the duplication of existing differentiated ECs. Here, we provide evidence for the existence of vascular endothelial stem cells (VESCs) that reside in the adult blood vessel wall endothelium. VESCs constitute a small subpopulation of ECs capable of clonal expansion, while other ECs have a very limited proliferative capacity. When isolated, these VESCs can produce tens of millions of endothelial daughter cells, and a single transplanted VESC can generate in vivo functional blood vessels that connect to host blood circulation. Isolated VESCs could be used in cell-based therapies for cardiovascular repair to restore tissue vascularization following ischemia and could also be pursued as a novel cellular target of inhibition to block pathological angiogenesis, for example during tumor growth.
