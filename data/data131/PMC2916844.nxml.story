How is your position in an environment represented in the brain, and how does the representation distinguish between multiple environments? One of the proposed answers relies on continuous attractor neural networks. Consider the web page of your campus map as a network of pixels. Every pixel is a neuron, and nearby pixels excite each other, while distant pairs are inhibited. As a result of their interactions, a bunch of close-by pixels will light up, indicating your current position as suggested by your web-cam (the sensory input). When you travel to another campus, the common assumption holds that pixels are completely scrambled and the excitatory/inhibitory pattern of connections is summed to the existing one. Now these connections and the sensory input will activate the pixels corresponding to your location in the new campus. The active pixels will look like noise in the old map. But what if the campuses are similar, i.e. the pixels are not completely scrambled? We show that the network has a novel way of distinguishing between the environments, by lighting up distinct subsets of pixels for each campus. This emergent selectivity for the environment could be a mechanism underlying hippocampal remapping and directional selectivity of place cells in 1D environments.
