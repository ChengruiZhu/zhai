The roles of secreted frizzled-related protein-1 (SFRP1) and β-catenin in human cancer have been widely studied, and it has recently been demonstrated that these proteins are associated with numerous human carcinomas. However, their clinical significance in glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) has not been examined. The current study aimed to analyze the correlation between the expression of SFRP1 and β-catenin, and clinicopathological characteristics in GBM patients. The expression of SFRP1 and β-catenin was assessed by immunohistochemistry in 113 samples of GBM and 40 normal brain tissues. Compared with normal brain tissues, GBM tissues exhibited significantly lower expression of SFRP1, and higher expression of β-catenin (both P<0.05). A Kaplan-Meier analysis revealed that patients with positive SFRP1 expression had a significantly longer overall survival (OS) time relative to those with negative SFRP1 expression (P<0.000), and that patients with positive β-catenin expression had a shorter OS time than those with negative β-catenin expression (P<0.000). A multivariate Cox regression analysis indicated that adjuvant treatment, SFRP1 expression and β-catenin expression were independent prognostic factors for OS (P<0.000, P=0.008 and P=0.001, respectively) in patients with GBM. The current data suggest that expression of SFRP1 and β-catenin may be considered significant prognostic indicators for patients with GBM.
