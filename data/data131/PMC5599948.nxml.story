Tenapanor (RDX5791, AZD1722), a first‐in‐class small molecule with minimal systemic availability, is an inhibitor of the sodium/hydrogen exchanger isoform 3. Tenapanor acts locally in the gut, where it reduces absorption of sodium and phosphate. It is being studied in patients with chronic kidney disease requiring dialysis, who are often administered phosphate binders such as sevelamer to help control hyperphosphatemia. We investigated whether coadministration of tenapanor with phosphate binders (sevelamer or calcium‐based binders) impacts the pharmacodynamic effects of tenapanor. In vitro studies suggested a binding interaction between tenapanor and sevelamer, but this did not translate into altered pharmacodynamic effects in rats. An open‐label, 2‐way crossover study was then conducted in healthy volunteers (NCT02346890). This showed that 4 days’ treatment with tenapanor hydrochloride (15 mg twice daily) with or without sevelamer carbonate (800 mg 3 times daily) resulted in comparable 24‐hour stool and urinary sodium and phosphorus levels. Stool frequency, consistency, and weight were also comparable between the treatments. These results suggest that the binding between sevelamer and tenapanor observed in vitro does not translate into altered pharmacodynamic effects in humans.
