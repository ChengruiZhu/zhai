The assembly and composition of basal bodies was investigated in the single-celled, biflagellate green alga, Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, using the cell wall-less strain, cw15. In the presence of EDTA, both flagellar axonemes remained attached to their basal bodies while the entire basal body-axoneme complex was separated from the cell body, without cell lysis, by treatment with polyethylene glycol-400. The axonemes were then removed from the basal bodies in the absence of EDTA, leaving intact basal body pairs, free from particulate contamination from other regions of the cell. The isolated organelles produced several bands on sodium dodecyl sulfate-urea polyacrylamide gels, including two tubilin bands which co-electrophoresed with flagellar tubulin. The formation of probasal bodies was observed by electron microscopy of whole mount preparations. Synchronous cells were lysed, centrifuged onto carbon-coated grids, and either negatively stained or shadowed with platinum. The two probasal bodies of each cell appeared shortly after mitosis as thin "annuli," not visible in thin sections, each consisting of nine rudimentary triplet microtubules. Each annulus remained attached to one of the mature basal bodies by several filaments about 60 in diameter, and persisted throughout interphase until just before the next cell division. It then elongated into a mature organelle. The results revive the possibility of the nucleated assembly of basal bodies.
