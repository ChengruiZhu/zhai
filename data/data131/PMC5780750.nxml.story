It was previously revealed that Wnt signaling is activated in mesothelioma cells. Although epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is expressed in mesothelioma cells, EGFR-tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) are not effective for mesothelioma treatment. However, in non-small cell lung cancer, the blocking of Wnt signaling has been identified to enhance the anticancer effect of EGFR-TKIs. To confirm the anticancer effect of blocking Wnt signaling in combination with EGFR-TKI treatment in mesothelioma, the present study evaluated the effect of simultaneous suppression of human dishevelled-3 (Dvl-3) expression with Dvl-3 small interfering RNA (siRNA) and of EGFR inhibition with gefitinib on mesothelioma cell viability. Mesothelioma cell lines with and without Î²-catenin gene expression were transfected with Dvl-3 siRNA and were cultured with gefitinib, and cell viability, colony formation and cell cycle analyses were performed. Dvl-3 siRNA downregulated the expression of Dvl-3 in mesothelioma cells. The combination of Dvl-3 siRNA with gefitinib acted synergistically to induce concomitant suppression of cell viability and colony formation, suggesting that inhibition of Wnt signaling by downregulating Dvl-3 with siRNA and inhibiting EGFR with gefitinib leads to significant antitumor effects.
