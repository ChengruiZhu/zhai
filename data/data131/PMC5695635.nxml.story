It is well acknowledged that non-coding genetic variants contribute to disease susceptibility through alteration of gene expression levels (known as eQTLs). Identifying the variants that are causal to both disease risk and changes to expression levels has not been easy and we believe this is in part due to how expression is quantified using RNA-Sequencing (RNA-Seq). Whole-gene expression, where abundance is estimated by culminating expression of all transcripts or exons of the same gene, is conventionally used in eQTL analysis. This low resolution may conceal subtle isoform switches and expression variation in independent exons. Using isoform-, exon-, and junction-level quantification can not only point to the candidate genes involved, but also the specific transcripts implicated. We make use of existing RNA-Seq expression data profiled at gene-, isoform-, exon-, junction-, and intron-level, and perform eQTL analysis using association data from twenty autoimmune diseases. We find exon-, and junction-level thoroughly outperform gene-level analysis, and by leveraging all five quantification types, we find >20% of autoimmune loci share a single genetic effect with gene expression. We highlight that existing and new eQTL cohorts using RNA-Seq should profile expression at multiple resolutions to maximise the ability to detect causal eQTLs and candidate genes.
