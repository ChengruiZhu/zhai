Antibodies against citrullinated proteins/peptides (ACPAs), and especially antibodies targeting mutated citrullinated vimentin (anti-MCVs), are novel biomarkers of rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Whereas ACPAs are specific and sensitive markers for RA, there have hardly been any reports relating to ACPAs in psoriatic arthritis (PsA) or in psoriasis without joint symptoms (PsO). The aim of the present study was to investigate the prevalence of anti-MCVs in PsA and PsO. Serum anti-MCV titers were measured in 46 PsA and 42 PsO patients and in 40 healthy controls by means of a commercial enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The potential correlations of the serum autoantibody levels with several clinical and laboratory parameters were examined. The anti-MCV levels in the PsA patients were significantly higher than those in the PsO group. Among the clinical variables, the presence of tender knee joints and nail psoriasis was significantly associated with anti-MCV positivity in the PsA patients. Higher anti-MCV titers in the PsO patients were associated with a more severe disease course and with the early onset of psoriatic skin symptoms. Our results suggest that anti-MCVs can be used as novel markers in the diagnosis of PsA and in a subset of PsO patients.
