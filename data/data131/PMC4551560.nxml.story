) Br J Pharmacol 165(6):1617–1643]. Modulating the chemokine receptor function provides new ways of targeting specific diseases. Therefore, discovery and development of drugs targeting chemokine receptors have received considerable attention from the pharmaceutical industry in the past decade. Along with that, the determination of bioactivities of individual metabolites derived from lead compounds towards chemokine receptors is crucial for drug selectivity, pharmacodynamics, and potential toxicity issues. Therefore, advanced analytical methodologies are in high demand. This study is aimed at the optimization of a new analytical method for metabolic profiling with parallel bioaffinity assessment of CXCR3 ligands of the azaquinazolinone and piperazinyl-piperidine class and their metabolites. The method is based on mass spectrometric (MS) identification after liquid chromatographic (LC) separation of metabolic mixtures. The bioaffinity assessment is performed “at-line” via high-resolution nanofractionation onto 96-well plates allowing direct integration of radioligand binding assays. This new method enables identification of metabolites from lead compounds with associated estimation of their individual bioaffinity. Moreover, the identification of the metabolite structures via accurate mass measurements and MS
