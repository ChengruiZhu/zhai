Individuals between 14 and 50 years of age participating in at least 100 hours of Level 1 or 2 sports activities that presented within 12 months of injury to both bundles of the ACL with or without injury to the medial or lateral meniscus were eligible to participate in this study. Individuals with prior injury or surgery of the ipsilateral or contralateral knee or greater than a grade 1 concomitant knee ligament injury were excluded. If the ACL insertion sites were between 14 and 18mm, as measured with an arthroscopic ruler at the time of arthroscopy, the subject was randomized to undergo SB or DB ACL reconstruction with a 10 mm quadriceps tendon autograft harvested with a patellar bone block. A single, anatomically placed femoral tunnel was used for all cases. For DB ACL reconstruction, the graft was split into to two arms and passed through two anatomically placed tibial tunnels. Subjects were followed at 3, 6, 12 and 24 months after randomization, with the primary endpoints occurring at 24 months. Outcome measures included the KT-1000 (side to side difference) and pivot shift tests, range of motion (ROM), IKDC Subjective Knee Form (IKDC-SKF) and return to pre-injury level of sports participation.
