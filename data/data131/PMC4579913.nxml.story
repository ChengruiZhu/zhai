To determine the clinical significance of C-X-C chemokine receptor type 4 (CXCR4) and β-catenin in osteosarcoma, their protein expression levels were assessed in 96 osteosarcoma and 20 osteochondroma cases using immunohistochemistry. Additionally, CXCR4 and β-catenin mRNA expression levels were measured in 16 fresh osteosarcoma and 16 adjacent healthy tissue samples using fluorescent reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR). In the osteosarcoma samples, the positive CXCR4 protein expression rate was significantly higher than the rate in the osteochondroma samples (68.75 vs. 20.00%; P<0.01). Furthermore, β-catenin protein expression was detected in 61.46% of osteosarcoma cases and 25.00% of osteochondroma cases. Similarly, the RT-qPCR data identified increased CXCR4 and β-catenin mRNA expression levels in the osteosarcoma compared with adjacent control tissues. It was determined that CXCR4 (P<0.01) and β-catenin (P<0.05) expression were significantly associated with the clinical Enneking stage, metastasis and survival of osteosarcoma. Furthermore, multivariate analysis identified CXCR4 and β-catenin protein expression levels, as well as clinical stage and metastasis, as significant risk factors for survival in patients with osteosarcoma (P<0.05). In conclusion, the present study determined that CXCR4 and β-catenin are abnormally expressed in osteosarcoma tissues, and, therefore, may be important during osteosarcoma progression.
