Upper urinary tract urothelial carcinoma (UTUC) is a rare disease, and novel prognostic factors for patients who have undergone a radical nephroureterectomy (RNU) for UTUC have been studied intensely. To the best of our knowledge, the prognostic value of urothelial recurrence in patients with UTUC has not been previously described in studies. The present study compared the prognostic value of urothelial and non-urothelial recurrence in patients with UTUC of the kidney and ureter managed by surgery. The inclusion criteria consisted of a diagnosis of non-metastatic UTUC (any T stage, N0–1 and M0) and receipt of an RNU with an ipsilateral bladder cuff as the primary treatment. Of the 153 patients that were screened for the study, comprehensive clinical and pathological data was available for 103 patients, who were consequently included in the analysis. Overall survival (OS) and cancer-specific survival (CSS) times were estimated. A multivariate analysis was performed using the Cox regression model. The median follow-up period was 29 months (interquartile range, 14–63 months). The patient population was comprised of 71 males (68.9%) and 32 females (31.1%). A total of 32 patients (31.1%) showed non-urothelial recurrence, while 38 patients (36.9%) exhibited urothelial recurrence and 33 patients (32.0%) exhibited no recurrence. When comparing the risk parameters between the non-urothelial recurrence categories, the factors of pathological grade, microvascular invasion, lymphatic invasion and pT classification showed significant differences. However, there were no significant differences between the urothelial recurrence categories. No significant difference was observed between the OS and CSS times within the urothelial recurrence categories (P=0.3955 and P=0.05891, respectively), but significant differences were identified in the non-urothelial recurrence categories (P<0.0001 and P<0.0001, respectively). Among the other relevant descriptive pre-operative characteristics in the multivariate analysis, only non-urothelial recurrence remained associated with a worse CSS [P=0.002; hazard ratio (HR) 9.512]. The results show that urothelial recurrence has a minimal prognostic value in patients with UTUC managed by RNU with an ipsilateral bladder cuff.
