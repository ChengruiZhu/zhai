 synthesis, p38–mitogen-activated protein kinase-dependent activation of caspase-3 and apoptotic cell death in most MCLs. However, in this report we describe that in some MCLs the response to treatment with cannabinoids decreased cell viability as assessed by metabolic activity but did not involve the caspase-3 cascade or loss of plasma membrane integrity. Both primary cells from one MCL patient and the MCL cell line Granta519 responded to treatment with cannabinoids by formation of cycloheximide-sensitive cytoplasmic vacuoles, but did not enter apoptosis. The persistent expression of mammalian homolog of Atg8 with microtubule-associated protein-1 light chain-3 II (LC3 II) and p62, as well as the lack of protection from chloroquine, indicates that lysosomal degradation is not involved in this cytoplasmic vacuolation process, distinguishing from classical autophagy. Transmission electron microscopy images and immunofluorescence staining of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) chaperone calreticulin showed that the vacuoles were of ER origin and that chromatin remained normal. These features resemble paraptosis-like cell death—a third type of a programmed cell death not previously described in response to cannabinoids.
