Sexual reproduction requires the formation of haploid gametes by a highly conserved, specialized cell division called meiosis. Failures in meiotic chromosome segregation lead to chromosomally imbalanced gametes that cause infertility and birth defects such as Trisomy 21 in humans. Meiotic crossovers, initiated by programmed double strand breaks (DSBs), are critical for proper chromosome segregation. Interhomolog strand invasion requires the presence of Rad51, and the strand invasion activity of the meiosis-specific recombinase Dmc1. The meiosis-specific kinase, Mek1, is a key regulator of meiotic recombination, promoting interhomolog strand invasion and recombination pathway choice. Rad51 activity during meiosis is inhibited by preventing the Rad51 protein from forming complexes with an accessory factor, Rad54, in two ways: (1) Mek1 phosphorylation of Rad54 and (2) binding of Rad51 by a meiosis-specific protein, Hed1. Why inactivation of Mek1 affects Hed1-mediated repression of Rad51 was previously unknown. This work demonstrates that Mek1 regulates the ability of Hed1 to inhibit Rad51 by direct phosphorylation of Hed1. Therefore in meiosis, Rad51 activity is regulated in part by the coordinated phosphorylation of both Rad54 and Hed1 by Mek1.
