It is now possible to score variations in DNA across whole genomes, RNA levels and alternative isoforms, metabolite levels, protein levels and protein state information, protein–protein interactions, and protein–DNA interactions, in a comprehensive fashion in populations of individuals. Interactions among these molecular entities define the complex web of biological processes that give rise to all higher order phenotypes, including disease. The development of analytical approaches that simultaneously integrate different dimensions of data is essential if we are to extract the meaning from large-scale data to elucidate the complexity of living systems. Here, we use a novel Bayesian network reconstruction algorithm that simultaneously integrates DNA variation, RNA levels, metabolite levels, protein–protein interaction data, protein–DNA binding data, and protein–small-molecule interaction data to construct molecular networks in yeast. We demonstrate that these networks can be used to infer causal relationships among genes, enabling the identification of novel genes that modulate cellular regulation. We show that our network predictions either recapitulate known biology or can be prospectively validated, demonstrating a high degree of accuracy in the predicted network.
