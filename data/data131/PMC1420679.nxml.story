Y chromosomes are typically gene poor and enriched with repetitive elements, making them difficult to sequence by standard methods. Hence, the Y chromosome gene repertoire in mammalian species other than human has not been explored until very recently. Here the authors used a directed approach to isolate Y chromosome genes of the domestic cat, an evolutionary divergent species from human and mouse. They found that the feline Y chromosome harbors its own unique set of genes that are expressed specifically in the testes, presumably where they play an important role in spermatogenesis. Paralleling the discoveries seen from the full human Y chromosome sequence, the feline Y chromosome has acquired and remodeled some genes from autosomes, while other genes have a shared ancestry with the X chromosome. However, none of the four new genes are found on the Y chromosomes of human or mouse, although two are shared with the canine Y chromosome. This work highlights the Y chromosome as a source of potential gene novelty in different species and suggests that more directed efforts at characterizing this hitherto understudied chromosome will further enrich our understanding of the types of genes found there and the roles they may play in mammalian spermatogenesis.
