DNA and RNA are fundamental molecules in the central dogma of molecular biology. Many biological behaviors of double-stranded DNA and RNA – including transcription/translation by proteins and packaging into compact structures – depend on their ability to flex and twist. Single-molecule tweezers now provide accurate mechanical measurements of DNA and RNA helices under force and torque but have not been used to rigorously falsify and thereby advance computational models. Here we present the first such blind challenge, involving recent dsRNA tweezers data that were kept hidden from modelers and a new HelixMC toolkit that resolves challenges in simulating long double helices from base-pair level models. The predictions gave excellent agreement with bending and stretching measurements of dsRNA but failed to recover twisting properties, pinpointing a critical area of future investigation. HelixMC also predicted that poly(A)/poly(T) and Z-DNA–biologically important variants whose elastic responses have not been studied with tweezers–will have distinct mechanical properties. These results open a route to iteratively falsifying and refining computational models of long nucleic acid helices, as is necessary for attaining a predictive understanding of their biological behaviors.
