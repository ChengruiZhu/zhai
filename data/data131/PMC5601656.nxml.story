In the connection between inflammation and cancer development, tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) contributes to the tumorigenesis. However, the underlying mechanism remains poorly understood. In this study, we report that TNF-α enhances the growth of breast cancer through up-regulation of oncoprotein hepatitis B X-interacting protein (HBXIP). Our data showed that the levels of TNF-α were positively related to those of HBXIP in clinical breast cancer tissues. Moreover, TNF-α could up-regulate HBXIP in breast cancer cells. Interestingly, silencing of TNF-α receptor 1 (TNFR1) blocked the effect of TNF-α on HBXIP. Mechanistically, we revealed that TNF-α could increase the activities of HBXIP promoter through activating transcriptional factor signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3). In addition, nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) and/or p38 signaling increased the levels of p-STAT3 in the cells. Strikingly, HBXIP could also up-regulate TNFR1, forming a positive feedback loop of TNFR1/NF-κB (and/or p38)/p-STAT3/HBXIP/TNFR1. Notably, TNF-α was able to up-regulate TNFR1 through driving the loop. In function, we demonstrated that the knockdown of HBXIP remarkably abolished the growth of breast cancer mediated by TNF-α
