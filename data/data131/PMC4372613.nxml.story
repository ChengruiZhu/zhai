In high-pressure situations, such as driving on a highway or flying a plane, people have limited time to select between competing options while acting. Each option is usually accompanied with reward benefits (e.g., avoid traffic) and action costs (e.g., fuel consumption) that characterize the value of the option. The value and the availability of an option can change dynamically even during ongoing actions which compounds the decision-making challenge. How the brain dynamically integrates value information from disparate sources and selects between competing options is still poorly understood. In the current study, we present a neurodynamical framework to show how a distributed brain network can solve the problem of value integration and action selection in decisions with competing alternatives. It combines dynamic neural field theory with stochastic optimal control theory, and includes circuitry for perception, expected reward, effort cost and decision-making. It provides a principled way to explain both the neural and the behavioral findings from a series of visuomotor decision tasks in human and animal studies. For instance, the model shows how the competitive interactions between populations of neurons within and between sensorimotor regions can result in “spatial-averaging” movements, and how decision-variables influence neural activity and choice behavior.
