Spatiotemporal dendritic imaging data, through fluorescent calcium indicators, opens an exciting window on computations performed by single neurons at a subcellular level. However, the analysis and interpretation of such data is challenging. The measurements are noisy, intermittent in space and/or time, and depend critically on the choice of the fluorescent indicator. Consequently, analysis is typically limited to a specific branch of the dendritic tree, neglects spatiotemporal correlations between neighboring compartments, and requires averaging over multiple trials. Here we derive a model for the spatiotemporal concentration of calcium bound probe molecules. Using state-space and optimization tools we derive a fast algorithm for estimating the most likely concentration based on the given measurements obtained from a single trial, and argue that it can provide an estimate of the fast transients of the underlying calcium concentration. In particular, our algorithm estimates the timing and amplitude of calcium transients due to backpropagating action potentials. It provides a flexible approach to inferring the structure of dendritic dynamics that are important in neural computation, but are inaccessible to direct measurement with current experimental techniques.
