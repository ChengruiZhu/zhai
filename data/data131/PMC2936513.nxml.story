Understanding the functioning of the primary visual cortex requires characterization of the non-linear dynamics that underlie visual perception and of how the cortical architecture gives rise to these dynamics. Recent advances in real-time voltage-sensitive dye (VSD) imaging permit recording of cortical population activity with high spatial and temporal resolution. This wealth of data can be related to cortical function, dynamics, and architecture by computational modeling. Here we used a mesoscopic neural field model to describe brain dynamics at the population level as measured by VSD imaging. Introduced in 1972 by Wilson and Cowan, these models are derived from statistical mechanics to analyze the collective properties of large numbers of neurons. For simplicity, the cortical planar tissue is assumed to contain only two types of homogeneously distributed neurons (excitatory and inhibitory) that interact via recurrent lateral connections. This study shows 1) how a concise neural field model can simulate VSD data quantitatively in space and time by identifying the underlying non-linear dynamics, 2) how such a model can support hypotheses about visual information processing, and 3) how the model can be linked to the neuronal architecture.
