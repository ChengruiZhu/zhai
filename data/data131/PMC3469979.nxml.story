Although a few studies have shown that vascularity is increased from normal mucosa to dysplasia to carcinoma suggesting that disease progression in the oral mucosa is accompanied by angiogenesis. The role in lymph node metastasis in oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) is equivocal. Role of angiogenesis in OSCC development and metastasis is evaluated in this study. This retrospective study of 50 samples consisted of 9 normal buccal mucosa, 22 leukoplakias, and 19 OSCC. Polyclonal antibodies to von-Willebrand factor were used to highlight the microvessels. Images were captured and morphometric image analysis was done for microvessel density (MVD), area, and perimeter. Highest, as well as mean values of these three parameters were compared. MVD and perimeter, but not area, are significantly different between normal mucosa and OSCC, and leukoplakia and OSCC. There were no differences between normal mucosa and leukoplakia. MVD, area, and perimeter were not significantly different between the OSCC with and without lymph node metastasis. The highest and mean values of MVD are significantly correlated. In the development of OSCC, angiogenic phenotypic change occurs in carcinomas rather than in the pre-cancerous stage, and quantification of angiogenesis in OSCC does not predict the risk of lymph node metastasis.
