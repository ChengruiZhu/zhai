At the core of PHM is self-management and Singapore’s continuous promotion of personal responsibility. To support self-management, there is a need to provide patients/people with access to timely, actionable health information—key ingredients of empowerment that leads to greater self-efficacy. Instead of the traditional approach of developing a “static” patient portal, Singapore is taking a unique approach of developing an “open” health technology platform capable of catering to diverse stakeholder needs, and one that allow healthcare providers, enterprises, interest groups to create and build web, mobile applications and interactive content on a common platform to support existing and new healthcare programmes and services. At the crux of the platform is personal health record which is a subset of the just launched, national electronic health record (NEHR) that provides a longitudinal view of the person’s health information generated through life-time encounters at various care settings. The development of a national demonstrator PHM project is underway, slated for launch in early Q2 2012 with participation of two regional healthcare providers aimed at providing self-management technology tools (web and mobile) for low-medium risk diabetic patients. This paper/presentation aims to outline and share Singapore’s approach to empowering patients through the national strategy, barriers and its implementation thus far and roadmap going forward.
