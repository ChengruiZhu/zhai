Microbial ecologists cannot observe their study organisms directly, so they use molecular sequencing to measure the abundance of different microbes living in the wild. The most commonly used method for measuring the abundance of different microbes is to collect a DNA sample from an environment and sequence a particular gene, the 16S SSU rRNA gene (“16S”) from those samples. The abundance of 16S sequences from different microbes is then used as a surrogate measure of the abundance of the microbial taxa in the community. One problem with the use of the 16S gene as a measure of microbial abundance is that many microbes have multiple copies of the gene in their genome. Thus, variation in 16S gene abundances can be caused by both genomic copy number variation and variation in the abundance of organisms. In this study we present a computational method that allows estimation of the abundance and genomic 16S copy number of microbes based on environmental sequencing of the 16S gene. We use simulations and analysis of microbial community data sets to demonstrate that estimating the abundance of organisms from 16S data improves our ability to accurately measure the diversity and abundance of microbial communities.
