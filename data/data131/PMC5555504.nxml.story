Seventeen studies encompassing 772 subjects (mean age, 14.3 years; range, 6.3-18.0 years) were analyzed. Eight studies (47%) reported on Tanner stage of subjects, while 1 study reported skeletal age. Ten studies (59%) clearly documented the presence or absence of surgical complications. Range of motion was reported in 65% of studies. Leg-length discrepancy and angular deformity were each reported in 76% of studies, with 12% quantifying results through radiographic measurements. Ligament testing was variably defined by inclusion of instrumented testing (65%), Lachman test (53%), and pivot-shift test (53%). Fourteen studies (82%) explicitly reported on the rate of ACL rerupture, while 71% reported on the rate of revision surgery. Rate of return to preinjury activity was reported in 8 studies (47%), of which 2 defined criteria for return to sport and 3 defined the level of competitive sport. Patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs) were used variably. For the 3 most commonly reported PROMs (Lysholm, International Knee Documentation Committee, and Tegner), 24% of studies reported all 3 PROMs, 35% of studies reported 2 PROMs, and 6% of studies reported 1 PROM in isolation. A pediatric-specific PROM was reported in 1 of the 17 studies.
