Different types of cells have distinct ways of utilizing nutrients and generating energy, thus resulting in distinct nutrient needs. Such cell type–specific metabolic differences are associated with many biological processes and force the symbiosis between different cells and organisms. For example, glutamine symbiosis is a well-recognized phenomenon due to different glutamine synthesis ability. In human cancers, glutamine is also recognized as an important and essential nutrient, termed glutamine addiction. But very little is known about how glutamine addiction varies among different tumors of diverse cellular origins, which hinders personalized therapeutic strategies. Here, we found that basal-type breast cancer cells were sensitive to glutamine deprivation while luminal-type breast cancer cells were not. Luminal cell–specific glutamine independence results from expression of glutamine synthetase conferring the ability to synthesize glutamine. Glutamine synthetase also represses glutaminase and contributes to the maintenance of the polarized expression of glutamine synthetase and glutaminase among breast cancer cells. Collectively, these data illustrate cross-talk between mammary differentiation programs and unique nutrient requirements, which may offer novel therapeutics for basal-type breast cancers.
