 A study of the red blood cells, hemoglobin, blood platelets, and the total and individual white blood cells was made on 180 male rabbits of known age and representing fifteen standard breeds. An attempt was made to eliminate or bold constant such variables as age, sex, season, time of examination, technical errors, food, housing, and disease. The mean, variance of the mean, and standard deviation were calculated for each breed sample and for the group as a whole. An analysis of the variance showed that the variation between the breed samples was significantly greater than the variation within the breed samples for the red blood cells, hemoglobin, blood platelets, total white blood cells, basophiles, eosinophiles, and lymphocytes per cubic millimeter and in per cent and the neutrophiles in per cent. No significant variations were detected in the monocytes except when the breeds were divided into heavy and light breeds. No variation in the neutrophiles per cubic millimeter was detected; a large number of the breeds had exactly the same mean neutrophile level. Characteristic blood formulae were found for the various breed samples having an adequate numerical representation. It was concluded that the varying blood formulae could not be explained on any other, except an hereditary (genetic) basis.
