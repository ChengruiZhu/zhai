Detection of IgG anti-Aquaporin-4 (AQP4) in serum of patients with Neuromyelitis optica syndrome disorders (NMOSD) has improved diagnosis of these processes and differentiation from Multiple sclerosis (MS). Recent findings also claim that a subgroup of patients with NMOSD, serum negative for IgG-anti-AQP4, present antibodies anti-AQP1 instead. Explore the presence of IgG-anti-AQP1 using a previously developed cell-based assay (CBA) highly sensitive to IgG-anti-AQP4. Serum of 205 patients diagnosed as NMOSD (8), multiple sclerosis (94), optic neuritis (39), idiopathic myelitis (29), other idiopathic demyelinating disorders of the central nervous system (9), other neurological diseases (18) and healthy controls (8), were used in a CBA over fixed HEK cells transfected with hAQP1-EGFP or hM23-AQP4-EGFP, treated with Triton X-100 and untreated. ELISA was also performed. Analysis of serum with our CBA indicated absence of anti-AQP1 antibodies, whereas in cells pretreated with detergent, noisy signal made reliable detection impossible. ELISA showed positive results in few serums. The low number of NMOSD serums included in our study reduces its power to conclude the specificity of AQP1 antibodies as new biomarkers of NMOSD. Our study does not sustain detection of anti-AQP1 in serum of NMOSD patients but further experiments are expected.
