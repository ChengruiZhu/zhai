Idiopathic central serous chorioretinopathy (CSC) typically affects middle-aged males. To date, only one case of idiopathic CSC in a prepubertal subject has been reported. Atypical idiopathic CSC presentation may be challenging to diagnose. Exclusion of secondary causes of serous retinal detachment (SRD) is warranted. We describe the atypical case of a 12-year-old female with a circumscribed SRD that resolved spontaneously and with fluorescein angiography (FA) findings that were compatible with idiopathic CSC. Optical coherence tomography (OCT) and systemic assessment were performed to exclude other etiologies. FA demonstrated multiple focal leaks in early phases, with subretinal leakage and pooling in late phases. OCT showed a localized circumscribed retinal detachment. Complete blood count was within normal limits. Serum cortisol was normal (22.1 Î¼g/dl) and mean arterial blood pressure was 100/60 mm Hg, thereby excluding secondary causes of CSC. This is the second reported case of idiopathic CSC in a prepubertal female and the first one documented by FA and OCT, as well as other studies to exclude secondary causes. Albeit rare, idiopathic CSC should be considered in the differential diagnosis of SRD in this (prepubertal) age group, after excluding secondary ocular or systemic etiologies.
