Emergency medicine (EM) residency programs are a new concept to India. As these programs develop in India the need for effective teaching tools for skills education will rise. A high fidelity simulation workshop was conducted with a intent to expose current residents posted in emergency departments (EDs) to the concept of simulation technology. The participants were subjected to scenarios which tested their core competencies, medical knowledge, and procedural skills using simulation technology. 50 residents were tested over 5 days and an overall satisfaction score and personal comments were assessed to rate the performance of this study. A pre- and post simulation survey was done. Results showed that participants felt that their understanding of communication of expectations increased from 38% fair or good to 76% very good or best. The frequency in which they thought they would ask for help increased from 36% fair or good to 88% very good or best. It was found that students had increased their confidence to challenge a questionable order from a superior from 48% occasionally or half of the time to 76% who would do it the majority of the time or always. In the post-survey, 80% would the majority of the time or always admit that they did not know something from 46% who stated they would only do it occasionally or half of the time. We concluded that simulation as a tool for teaching unknown and stressful conditions of ED naturally pair. Resident core competencies can be taught and evaluated more effectively in the simulation lab in a controlled, safe, and collegial manner.
