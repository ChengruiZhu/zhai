This multicenter, observational drug utilization (DU) study (NCT01594996) investigated the profile of patients and specialist providers who prescribed extended release quetiapine fumarate (quetiapine XR) for treatment of major depressive disorder (MDD) across five European countries (Germany, Italy, Romania, Spain, and Sweden). A DU data abstraction form captured information on the characteristics of physicians, patients, and drugs utilized in the medical management of depressive episodes in MDD, where the therapeutic regimen included quetiapine XR. Data were reported descriptively. This analysis included 811 patients. Psychiatric histories indicated a burden of severe MDD in these patients. Patient demographics were similar across countries; however, those in Sweden had a younger mean age. Physicians’ ratings of the therapeutic effect of prior treatment with antidepressants suggested the need for an add-on treatment for most patients. Overall, 15.7% of patients initiated quetiapine XR treatment as monotherapy. Presence of psychotic symptoms during depressive episodes predicted treatment with higher than recommended doses of quetiapine XR (odds ratio=3.11; 95% confidence interval: 1.6–6.0). This analysis demonstrated similarities in DU across the countries analyzed, largely in accordance with the recommended dose of quetiapine XR as an adjunctive therapy to antidepressants in MDD (50–300 mg/day).
