Genetic association studies are usually conducted on phenotypes measured at the scale of whole tissues or individuals, and not at the scale of individual cells. However, some common traits, such as cancer, can result from a minority of cells that adopted a special behavior. From one individual to another, DNA variants can modify the frequency of such cellular behaviors. The body of one of the individuals then harbours more misbehaving cells and is therefore predisposed to a macroscopic phenotypic change, such as disease. Such genetic effects are probabilistic, they contribute little to trait variation at the macroscopic level and therefore largely escape detection in classical studies. We have developed a novel statistical method that uses single-cell measurements to detect variants of the genome that have non-deterministic effects on cellular traits. The approach is based on a comparison of distributions of single-cell traits. We applied it to colonies of yeast cells and showed that it can detect mutations that change cellular morphology or molecular regulations in a probabilistic manner. This opens the way to study multicellular organisms from a novel angle, by exploiting single-cell technologies to detect genetic variants that predispose to certain diseases or common traits.
