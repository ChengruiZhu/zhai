microRNAs (miRNAs/miRs) are a conserved class of endogenous, short non-coding RNAs that post-transcriptionally regulate the expression of genes involved in diverse cellular processes. miR-214 has been reported to be associated with several cancers, including human colon cancer. However, the function of miR-214 in colon cancer development is poorly understood. In the current study, miR-214 was demonstrated to be downregulated in colon cancer tissues compared with healthy colon tissues. Functional studies showed that miR-214 overexpression results in the inhibition of cell viability, colony formation and proliferation, and the induction of cell apoptosis. ADP-ribosylation factor-like protein 2 (ARL2) is predicted to be a target candidate of miR-214. A luciferase reporter assay, western blot analysis and quantitative polymerase chain reaction were performed, which revealed that miR-214 negatively regulates ARL2 expression by targeting its 3â€² untranslated region directly. In conclusion, the results of the present study revealed that miR-214 suppresses colon cancer cell growth via the suppression of ARL2, and indicated that miR-214 may present a significant potential therapeutic target for colon cancer.
