To demonstrate the mutational profiles in solid tumors, we profiled 165 solid tumor samples, including 9 cancer types and 4 sample types, by using amplicon-based next-generation sequencing panel covering 48 highly mutated tumorigenesis-related genes that were deep sequenced at an average coverage of 2000Ã—. Both tumor and sample types had significant effect on tumor genetic mutational profiles. Concurrent driver mutations were frequently detected in solid tumor, concentrating on both modes of action driver genes (activating or loss of function). Furthermore, in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), concurrent driver mutations were also significantly correlated with the lymph node metastasis status and pathological types. Higher frequency of lymph node metastasis was observed in patients with NSCLC with concurrent mutations on at least two driver genes. In addition, patients with lung adenocarcinoma were more likely to harbor concurrent driver mutations than patients with lung squamous and large cell carcinoma. Multiple mutations in the epidermal growth factor receptor gene were more frequently detected in patients with refractory NSCLC compared to untreated naive ones. Therefore, concurrent multiple driver mutations, rather than a single genetic mutation, should be investigated extensively to probe novel genetic biomarkers with clinical benefits.
