Lenvatinib is an oral tyrosine kinase inhibitor of vascular endothelial growth factor receptors 1, 2, and 3, fibroblast growth factor receptors 1 through 4, as well as platelet-derived growth factor receptor Î±, RET, and KIT. At present, lenvatinib is used in the treatment of thyroid cancer and renal cell carcinoma. We herein report a case of a 67-year-old patient with squamous cell carcinoma of unknown primary who was effectively treated with lenvatinib. The patient was initially diagnosed as having undifferentiated thyroid cancer, and after total thyroidectomy and bilateral lymph node dissection, lenvatinib was administered for the treatment of residual lymph node metastasis. A computed tomography scan after 1 month of lenvatinib administration showed marked regression of the lymph nodes, but interstitial pneumonia was also detected. Because the drug lymphocyte stimulation test for lenvatinib was strongly positive, we concluded that the interstitial pneumonia was induced by lenvatinib. The interstitial pneumonia only improved by the withdrawal of lenvatinib. Finally, his thyroid tumor was diagnosed as a metastasis of squamous cell carcinoma; however, we were unable to identify the primary lesion. This is the first reported case of interstitial pneumonia induced by lenvatinib.
