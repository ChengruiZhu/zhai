DNAX accessory molecule 1 (DNAM-1; CD226) is a transmembrane glycoprotein involved in T cell and natural killer (NK) cell cytotoxicity. We demonstrated recently that DNAM-1 triggers NK cell–mediated killing of tumor cells upon engagement by its two ligands, poliovirus receptor (PVR; CD155) and Nectin-2 (CD112). In the present paper, we show that PVR and Nectin-2 are expressed at cell junctions on primary vascular endothelial cells. Moreover, the specific binding of a soluble DNAM-1–Fc molecule was detected at endothelial junctions. This binding was almost completely abrogated by anti-PVR monoclonal antibodies (mAbs), but not modified by anti–Nectin-2 mAbs, which demonstrates that PVR is the major DNAM-1 ligand on endothelial cells. Because DNAM-1 is highly expressed on leukocytes, we investigated the role of the DNAM-1–PVR interaction during the monocyte transendothelial migration process. In vitro, both anti–DNAM-1 and anti-PVR mAbs strongly blocked the transmigration of monocytes through the endothelium. Moreover, after anti–DNAM-1 or anti-PVR mAb treatment, monocytes were arrested at the apical surface of the endothelium over intercellular junctions, which strongly suggests that the DNAM-1–PVR interaction occurs during the diapedesis step. Altogether, our results demonstrate that DNAM-1 regulates monocyte extravasation via its interaction with PVR expressed at endothelial junctions on normal cells.
