-regulatory modules, are the major transcriptional control elements in the genome. Some enhancers are activated by the Notch cell–cell signaling pathway, in many different cellular contexts in the same organism. It is well established that the cell type–specific activity of each such enhancer depends in part on its particular combination of transcription factor binding sites. But how important is the enhancer's “architecture”—the number, order, spacing, and orientation of these binding sites—in determining its function and specificity? Here we have examined in detail the role of architecture in the activity of two different Notch-regulated enhancers. We find that one is largely insensitive to rearrangement of its important factor binding sites. But even simple alterations can cause the second enhancer to lose much of its normal activity and to become active in novel territories. By more substantial rearrangements, we can even convert the specificity of the second enhancer to that of the first. Therefore, besides binding site composition, the architecture of some enhancers also plays an essential role in determining when and where they respond to the same signaling pathway during development.
