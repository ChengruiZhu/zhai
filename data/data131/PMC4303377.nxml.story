Ectopic activity is associated with multiple cardiac disorders and has been implicated in the initiation of self-sustaining re-entrant excitation. Identifying the presence and origin of ectopic activity may be vital in improving diagnosis and treatment of disorders such as atrial fibrillation, and has been the subject of multiple studies. The electrical activity of the heart can be non-invasively monitored through the electrocardiogram. However, the standard 12-lead electrocardiogram may not provide sufficient information to resolve the focus of ectopic activity satisfactorily and accurately; more detailed multi-lead electrocardiograms may provide more information to be able to produce an algorithm to locate the origin of ectopic activity. Using a 3D computational atria-torso model developed in our laboratory, we simulated the electrical activity of the atria under normal and different ectopic conditions. The model was first validated by comparison to experimental data, and then used to develop an algorithm to identify the location of atrial ectopic focus using a 64-lead electrocardiogram. The algorithm developed was able to identify the origin of atrial ectopic activity in 75/80 simulations, which is a significant improvement compared to previously developed algorithms. Furthermore, the study suggests that multi-lead electrocardiograms provide significant benefits over the standard 12-lead configuration.
