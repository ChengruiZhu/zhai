The term orbital hypertelorism (ORH) implies “widely apart orbits.” This may also be associated with the abnormal vertical orientation of the orbits (dystopia). This deformity may be unilateral or bilateral, symmetric or asymmetric and may be present in a variety of craniofacial conditions. The treatment is primarily carried out for aesthetic reasons. The timing of treatment is dictated by the underlying condition and the type of procedure envisaged. The mainstay of treatment consists of moving the orbits medially to near normal position. This is accomplished by either an orbital translocation or facial bipartition technique. The choice of procedure is governed by the shape of the maxillary arch and associated occlusal conditions. We must differentiate between the telecanthus (also called pseudo-hypertelorism) and a true ORH as the management differs in these two conditions. The ORH involves extensive intracranial and extracranial operation whereas the telecanthus correction is relatively simpler surgery. The article will discuss the aetiology, classification, presentation, treatment options, timing of surgery and the choice of surgical procedures. Illustrative case reports with long-term results will be used to explain the management of these patients.
