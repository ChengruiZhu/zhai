Previous studies have shown that long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) were related to human carcinogenesis and might be designated as diagnosis and prognosis biomarkers. Hydroquinone (HQ), as one of the metabolites of benzene, was closely relevant to occupational benzene poisoning and occupational leukemia. Using high-throughput sequencing technology, we investigated differences in lncRNA and mRNA expression profiles between experimental group (HQ 20 Î¼mol/L) and control group (PBS). Compared to control group, a total of 65 lncRNAs and 186 mRNAs were previously identified to be aberrantly expressed more than two fold change in experimental group. To validate the sequencing results, we selected 10 lncRNAs and 10 mRNAs for quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR). Through GO annotation and KEGG pathway analysis, we obtained 3 mainly signaling pathways, including P53 signaling pathway, which plays an important role in tumorigenesis and progression. After that, 25 lncRNAs and 32 mRNAs formed the lncRNA-mRNA co-expression network were implemented to play biological functions of the dysregulated lncRNAs transcripts by regulating gene expression. The lncRNAs target genes prediction provided a new idea for the study of lncRNAs. Finally, we have another important discovery, which is screened out 11 new lncRNAs without annotated. All these results uncovered that lncRNA and mRNA expression profiles in TK6 cells exposed to low dose HQ were different from control group, helping to further study the toxicity mechanisms of HQ and providing a new direction for the therapy of leukemia.
