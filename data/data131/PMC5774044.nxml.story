The questionnaire was distributed to 1306 parents. The response rate was 78.9%, 56.6% respondents were mothers with a mean age of 40 ± 7. Sixty-seven percent of the parents admitted to self-prescription once or more, and the most common reason for self-prescribing, was because they thought the child was not ill enough to be taken to hospital (41.8%). This was followed by 37.7% who used “leftovers”. Regarding the attitude toward antibiotic prescription, 62.5% agreed that children should not be given an antibiotic when they have a fever and nasal congestion. In addition, 63.5% agreed that they should give their child antibiotic for ear or throat pain. Around two-thirds agreed that upper respiratory tract infection (URTI) was caused by a virus. Those who obtained their information from primary health-care centers and general practitioners had the lowest median of total knowledge score, and the highest knowledge was for those who obtained information from websites and the social media. Multiple linear regressions revealed that parents whose incomes were high, had high education, had children in private schools were more likely to have good knowledge and highly favorable attitudes and practices toward antibiotic use.
