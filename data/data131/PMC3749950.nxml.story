It has been known since the pioneering studies of Ivan Petrovich Pavlov that changes in the nervous system enable animals to associate neutral stimuli with stimuli of ecological significance. The goal of this paper is to study whether genetic regulatory networks that govern the production and degradation of proteins in all living cells are capable of a similar associative learning. We show that a standard model of a genetic regulatory network is capable of learning multiple overlapping associations, similar to a neural network. These results demonstrate that even bacteria that are devoid of a nervous system can learn associations. Moreover, as cells often reside in large clonal populations, as in a colony of bacteria or in tissue, we consider the ability of a large population of identical cells to learn associations. We show that even if the cells do not interact, the computational capabilities of the population far exceed those of the single cell. This result is a first demonstration of “wisdom of crowds” in clonal populations of cells. Finally, we provide specific guidelines for the experimental detection of associative learning in populations of bacteria, a phenomenon that may have been overlooked in standard experiments.
