A robust behaviour is a desirable feature in many biological systems. The study of mechanisms capable of maintaining the transient response unchanged despite environmental disturbances has recently motivated the introduction of a new concept: Dynamical Compensation (DC). However, the original definition of DC with respect to a parameter amounts to structural unidentifiability of that parameter, which means that it cannot be estimated by measuring the model output. Since most biological models have unknown parameters that need to be estimated, DC can be considered a negative property for the purpose of model identification. In this paper we reconcile these two conflicting views by proposing a new definition of DC that captures its intended biological meaning (i.e. robustness, which should be a systemic property, intrinsic to the dynamics) while making it distinct from structural unidentifiability (which is a modelling property that depends on decisions made by the modeller, such as the choice of model outputs or unknown parameters, and on experimental constraints). Our definition enables a model to have DC with respect to a structurally identifiable parameter, thus increasing the applicability of the concept.
