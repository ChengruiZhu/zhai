Canonical Wnt signaling regulates many aspects of cellular physiology and tissue homeostasis during development and in adult organisms. In molecular terms, stimulation by Wnt ligands leads to the stabilization of β-catenin, its translocation to the nucleus, and stimulation of TCF (T-cell factor)-dependent transcription of target genes. This process is controlled at various stages by a number of regulatory proteins, including transcriptional activators and repressors. Here we demonstrate that the endosomal proteins APPL1 and APPL2 are novel activators of β-catenin/TCF-mediated transcription. APPL proteins are multifunctional adaptors and effectors of the small GTPase Rab5, which localize to a subpopulation of early endosomes but are also capable of nucleocytoplasmic shuttling. Overexpression of APPL1 or APPL2 protein stimulates the activity of β-catenin/TCF-dependent reporter construct, whereas silencing of APPL1 reduces it. Both APPL proteins interact directly with Reptin, a transcriptional repressor binding to β-catenin and HDAC1 (histone deacetylase 1), and this interaction was mapped to the pleckstrin homology domain of APPL1. Moreover, APPL proteins are present in an endogenous complex containing Reptin, β-catenin, HDAC1, and HDAC2. Overexpression of either APPL protein relieves Reptin-dependent transcriptional repression and correlates with the reduced amounts of HDACs and β-catenin associated with Reptin as well as with the lower levels of Reptin and HDAC1 on the promoters of β-catenin target genes. We propose that APPL proteins exert their stimulatory effects on β-catenin/TCF-dependent transcription by decreasing the activity of a Reptin-containing repressive complex.
