The division of a cell into two daughter cells is an essential characteristic of living systems. This process requires the assembly of a contractile ring attached to the membrane at the site of division. At the appropriate point of the cell cycle, the ring constricts and pulls the membrane with it, pinching the cell at the division plane and forming daughter cells. In bacteria, the ring is a polymer of the protein FtsZ. The biochemical features of the isolated FtsZ protein have been studied intensively, but how these features are related to the function of the ring in living cells is not clear. In this work, we mathematically modeled the dynamics of FtsZ ring assembly, steady-state maintenance, and contraction both inside and outside of a cellular environment. The model is extremely simple and includes only experimentally known features of the FtsZ protein. The model exhibited behavior associated with the FtsZ ring in living cells, indicating that no additional mechanistic features are needed to explain this behavior. Our systems biology approach has been successful in relating molecular-level chemical processes with cellular-level behavior. A similar approach might be used to develop an analogous model for the more complex contractile rings found in eukaryotic (e.g., human) cells.
