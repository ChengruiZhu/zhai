During the past two decades, brain mapping research has undergone a paradigm switch. In addition to localizing brain regions that encode specific sensory, motor or cognitive processes, neuroimaging data is nowadays further exploited to ask questions about how information is transmitted through brain networks. The ambition here is to ask questions such as: “what is the nature of the information that region A passes on to region B”. This can be experimentally addressed by, e.g., showing that the influence that A exerts onto B depends upon specific sensory, motor or cognitive manipulations. This means one has to compare (in a statistical sense) candidate network models of the brain (with different modulations of effective connectivity, say), based on experimental data. The question we address here is how one should design the experiment in order to best discriminate such candidate models. We approach the problem from a statistical decision theoretical perspective, whereby the optimal design is the one that minimizes the model selection error rate. We demonstrate the approach using simulated and empirical data and show how it can be applied to any experimental question that can be framed as a model comparison problem.
