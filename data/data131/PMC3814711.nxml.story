Exposure to lead has been well recognized in a number of work environments, but little is known about lead exposure associated with machining brass keys containing lead. The brass that is widely used for key manufacturing usually contains 1.5% – 2.5 % of lead. Six (6) licensed locksmiths and 6 case-matched controls successfully completed the pilot study to assess the prevalence of increased body lead burden of professional locksmiths. We measured both Blood Lead (atomic absorption spectrometry), bone-lead (KXRF) and had each subject complete a health and lead exposure risk questionnaire. One locksmith had not cut keys during the past two years, therefore this subject and case-matched control was excluded from the blood lead analysis only. The average blood-lead concentration (±SEM) for the 5 paired subjects was 3.1 (± 0.4) μg/dL and 2.2 (± 0.3) μg /dL for controls. Bone measurements, including all 6 paired subjects, showed tibia lead concentration (±SEM) for locksmiths and controls was 27.8 (± 2.3) μg /g and 13.7 (± 3.3) μg /g, respectively; average calcaneus lead concentration for locksmiths and controls was 31.9 (± 3.7) μg /g and 22.6 (± 4.1) μg /g, respectively: The t-test shows a significantly higher tibia lead (
