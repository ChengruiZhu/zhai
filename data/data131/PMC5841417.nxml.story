Flubendazole, FDA-approved anthelmintic, has been widely used in treating testinal parasites. In the recent years, Flubendazole has been reported to exert anticancer activities. On the other hand, little was known about the effects of Flubendazole on gliomas. Here we demonstrated a novel effect of flubendazole on glioma cells. We found that Flubendazole inhibited cell proliferation and promoted cell apoptosis of glioma cell lines in vitro, and suppressed tumor growth in xenograft models by intraperitoneal injection. However, Flubendazole might have no influence on cell migration. Mechanism study reaveled that Flubendazole caused cell cycle arrest in G2/M phase, which partly account for the suppressed proliferation. Consistently, Flubendazole induced P53 expression and reduced Cyclin B1 and p-cdc2 expression in glioma cells. In addition, Flubendazole promoted cell apoptosis by regulating the classical apoptosis protein BCL-2 expression. These observations suggest that Flubendazole exerts anti-proliferation and pro-apoptosis effects in Glioma through affecting the cell cycle and intrinsic apoptotic signaling, and indicate a novel utilization of Flubendazole in the treatment of Glioma.
