Methylation is an essential DNA modification, which is attracting a lot of attention as a regulator of gene expression. Recent technological advances have allowed the genome-wide measurement of methylation at single-nucleotide resolution, leading to the discovery of several new types of methylation patterns. One prominent example are partially methylated domains (PMDs), which are regions with reduced average methylation, covering up to 40% of the genome. PMDs are found in only a subset of cell types, particularly in differentiated and cancer cells. An outstanding question is how methylation levels in PMDs are determined and how they can be interpreted at the single-nucleotide level. Here we provide a new model of methylation in PMDs. Single-nucleotide methylation levels in PMDs, albeit reduced on average, are highly variable along the genome. Furthermore, they are precisely set and can be predicted using DNA sequence features, establishing a new link between methylation and the underlying genetic information. This results in a high correlation of methylation levels in PMDs across different cell types. Our findings suggest that in any comparative analyses, PMDs should be analyzed as entities, strongly reducing the complexity of high-resolution DNA methylation analyses.
