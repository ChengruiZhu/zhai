In this population-based nationwide matched case-control study, patients 0–14 years of age with ALL diagnosed 1991–2006 and registered in the Swiss Childhood Cancer Registry were linked with their census records of 1990 and 2000. Eight controls per case were selected from the census. The association between family characteristics and ALL was analyzed by conditional logistic regressions. We found that increasing maternal age was associated with incidence of ALL in the offspring (OR per 5-year increase in maternal age 1.18, 95% CI 1.05–1.31; p = 0.004), remaining stable (trend OR 1.14, 95% CI 0.99–1.31; p = 0.060) after adjustment for other risk factors. The association with paternal age was weaker (OR per 5-year increase 1.14, 95% CI 1.01–1.28, p = 0.032) and disappeared after adjustments. Number of older siblings was not associated with risk of ALL in the overall group of children aged 0–14 years at diagnosis. However, we found a negative trend between number of older siblings and ALL diagnosed at age 0–4 years (OR per sibling 0.85, 95% CI 0.68–1.06; p = 0.141) and a positive trend for ALL diagnosed at age 5–9 (OR 1.34, 95% CI 1.05–1.72; p = 0.019), with some evidence for an effect modification (p-value for interaction  = 0.040).
