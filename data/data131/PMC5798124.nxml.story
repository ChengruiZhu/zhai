IgA nephropathy (IgAN) is the most common cause of primary glomerulonephritis worldwide. Up to 30% of cases develop the progressive form of the disease, eventually requiring renal replacement therapy. Diagnosis and risk stratification relies on an invasive kidney biopsy and management options are limited, with recurrence following renal transplantation being common. Thus the quest to understand the pathophysiology of IgAN has been one of great importance. MicroRNAs (miRs) are short nucleotides that suppress gene expression by hybridizing to the 3â€² untranslated region of messenger RNA (mRNAs), promoting mRNA degradation or disrupting translation. First discovered in 1993, miRs have since been implicated in a number of chronic conditions, including cancer, heart disease and kidney disease. The mounting interest in the field of miRs has led to fascinating developments in the field of nephrology, ranging from their roles as biomarkers for disease to the development of miR antagonists as avenues for treatment. The translational potential for miRs in IgAN is thus well grounded and may represent a paradigm shift in current approaches to the disease. This review aims to summarize the literature with regard to miRs and their roles in IgAN.
