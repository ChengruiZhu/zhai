Intracellular amyloid beta (Aβ) has been implicated in neuronal cell death in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Intracellular Aβ also contributes to tight junction breakdown of retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) in age-related macular degeneration (AMD). Although Aβ is predominantly secreted from neuronal cells, the mechanism of Aβ transport into RPE remains to be fully elucidated. In this study, we demonstrated that intracellular Aβ was found concomitantly with the breakdown of tight junction in RPE after subretinal injection of Aβ into the mouse eye. We also presented evidence that receptor for advanced glycation end products (RAGE) contributed to endocytosis of Aβ in RPE. siRNA-mediated knockdown of RAGE prevented intracellular Aβ accumulation as well as subsequent tight junction breakdown in RPE. In addition, we found that RAGE-mediated p38 MAPK signaling contributed to endocytosis of Aβ. Blockade of RAGE/p38 MAPK signaling inhibited Aβ endocytosis, thereby preventing tight junction breakdown in RPE. These results implicate that intracellular Aβ contributes to the breakdown of tight junction in RPE via the RAGE/p38 MAPK-mediated endocytosis. Thus, we suggest that RAGE could be a potential therapeutic target for intracellular Aβ induced outer BRB breakdown in AMD.
