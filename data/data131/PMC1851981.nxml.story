DNA is a fragile thread that often breaks. When it does, the cell must find a way to splice the broken ends back together in order to continue its cycle of replication. Cells possess an array of ways to rejoin broken DNA ends, each with advantages and disadvantages. Some are “quick and dirty,” sacrificing accuracy for robustness. They do the basic job of resealing the break but often result in random base changes at the site of the repair. At the other extreme are methods with greater fidelity but added restrictions, such as requiring chromosome replication. We used an experimental system to obtain highly accurate measurements of the relative usage of various repair methods in developing germ cells of fruit flies. The measurements were made in normal flies as well as those carrying mutations at each of 11 genes involved in DNA repair. Most previous studies of these genes focused on specific biochemical pathways. Our results looked at how the repair apparatus as a whole compensates for defects in individual components. The data point to a “decision circuit” for matching each break to a repair method and provide new insight into how our DNA repair machinery protects the genome's integrity.
