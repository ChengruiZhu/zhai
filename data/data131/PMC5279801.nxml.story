Acyl carrier proteins are small ubiquitous proteins involved in the synthesis of hydrocarbon based molecules. Notably, they are essential for the synthesis of fatty acids, which are the precursors of membrane phospholipids. They can also be involved in secondary metabolism, for example for the synthesis of molecules with antibacterial properties. Although acyl carrier proteins are widespread, the specific role of each individual protein seems comparatively poorly explored. In this study, we investigate the role of an acyl carrier protein genetically associated with a type 3 secretion system (T3SS). Many Gram-negative bacterial pathogens use T3SS to deliver effectors directly into the cytoplasm of eukaryotic host cells and to subvert host cellular pathways. For this purpose, the translocon, which is the terminal part of T3SS, forms a pore inserted into the host-cell membrane. Here we show that the acyl carrier protein associated with the T3SS has specialized to allow acylation of the translocon. The novel posttranslational modification of the translocon that we describe optimizes insertion into the host-cell membrane and pore-forming activity. This mechanism is likely to be conserved in other pathogenic bacteria given the conserved genetic association between T3SS and acyl carrier protein in several bacteria.
