. Untreated bone-derived cell cultures produced well organized bone-like structures with a bone-specific matrix. Treatment with RANKL induced formation of tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase-positive multinucleated cells that exhibited morphological features of osteoclasts. RANKL induced NF-κB activation, whereas pretreatment with resveratrol completely inhibited this activation and suppressed the activation of IκBα kinase and IκBα phosphorylation and degradation. RANKL up-regulated p300 (a histone acetyltransferase) expression, which, in turn, promoted acetylation of NF-κB. Resveratrol inhibited RANKL-induced acetylation and nuclear translocation of NF-κB in a time- and concentration-dependent manner. In addition, activation of Sirt-1 (a histone deacetylase) by resveratrol induced Sirt-1-p300 association in bone-derived and preosteoblastic cells, leading to deacetylation of RANKL-induced NF-κB, inhibition of NF-κB transcriptional activation, and osteoclastogenesis. Co-treatment with resveratrol activated the bone transcription factors Cbfa-1 and Sirt-1 and induced the formation of Sirt-1-Cbfa-1 complexes. Overall, these results demonstrate that resveratrol-activated Sirt-1 plays pivotal roles in regulating the balance between the osteoclastic
