Interleukin (IL)-7 is a stromal cell–derived cytokine required for the survival, proliferation, and differentiation of B cell precursors. Members of the Bcl-2 family of proteins are known to have profound effects on lymphocyte survival, but not lymphocyte differentiation. To distinguish the relative dependence on IL-7 of B cell precursor survival versus B cell differentiation, the combined effects of lack of IL-7 and lack of the proapoptotic Bcl-2 relative, Bim, were studied. Bim is expressed to varying degrees in all B cell precursors and B cells. Lack of Bim compensated for lack of IL-7 in the survival of pro–, pre–, and immature B cells; however, lack of Bim did not substitute for the requirement for IL-7 in B cell precursor differentiation or B cell precursor proliferation. Precursor B cell survival is more dependent on sufficient levels of IL-7 than precursor B cell differentiation because the number of B cells and their precursors were reduced by half in mice heterozygous for IL-7 expression, but were restored to normal numbers in mice also lacking Bim. Hence, Bim and IL-7 work together to control the survival of B cell precursors and the number of B cells that exist in animals.
