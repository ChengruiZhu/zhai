In sexually reproducing organisms, crossing over between homologous chromosomes in meiosis creates physical linkages required to segregate chromosomes into haploid gametes. In baker’s yeast, which utilizes meiotic recombination pathways conserved in mice and humans, the majority of meiotic crossovers are initiated through the formation of a branched DNA intermediate, which is stabilized by the Msh4-Msh5 complex. This DNA intermediate is further processed to form a structure (a double Holliday junction), which requires the endonuclease activity of the Mlh1-Mlh3 DNA mismatch repair factor to be resolved exclusively into a crossover product. Current meiotic recombination models invoke the use of structure-specific enzymes that symmetrically cleave single Holliday junctions. In this study, we provide evidence that the yeast Mlh1-Mlh3 complex is unlikely to act as a structure-specific enzyme. Furthermore, we showed that Mlh1-Mlh3’s endonuclease activity is dependent upon its ability to form a polymer on DNA and suggest that it is capable of cleaving DNA that is captured in an active complex. Together, our biochemical observations support a novel model involving regulated polymerization of Mlh1-Mlh3 for its cleavage function, potentially in meiotic crossovers or in mismatch repair.
