Temporomandibular joint ankylosis, a debilitating disease mainly affecting children, is characterized by progressive restriction of mouth opening and maxilla-mandibular developmental deformities. Craniofacial distraction osteogenesis has been developed as a standard surgical strategy for rectification of craniofacial deformities. The purpose of this study was to assess mono-planar distraction devices for the correction of various mandibular asymmetries in patients with unilateral temporomandibular joint ankylosis who developed restricted mouth opening and mandibular retrognathia. All patients were treated using one-stage distraction osteogenesis followed by temporalis fascia interpositional arthroplasty under general anesthesia. A significant increase in mandibular ramus and base length was observed. Although an increase in anterior lower facial height was observed, it was not significant statistically. A decrease in posterior lower facial height and corpus was observed. Oblique distraction with angular osteotomy allowed lengthening of both the ramus and corpus, yielding satisfactory results and hence eliminating the need of secondary surgery. In conclusion, univector internal distractors are effective for correction of multi-planar mandibular deficiencies by optimizing its placement through meticulous planning.
