The ability to accumulate culture is unique to hominids. Yet, understanding of the processes that drive cultural evolution is limited. We develop a computational model that incorporates characteristics of human innovation and offers an explanation for one of the puzzling observations in the archaeological record of stone tools: its extreme punctuation. The record shows long periods of little technological change, interspersed with abrupt increases in cultural complexity. Within these periods of relative stasis smaller punctuations occur, with sudden gain or loss of suites of tools. We suggest that the two types of punctuation may result from two processes: small punctuations are driven by innovations that trigger invention of related tools, and large punctuations reflect changes in the steady state of the size of the populationâ€™s tool repertoire. In our model, these changes of steady state occur when cultural processes can change the parameters of their own evolution. This occurs, for example, through innovations that change the availability of food and lead to an increased population size or innovations that increase the effectiveness of cultural transmission. Our results suggest that the common attribution of sudden cultural shifts to external processes such as cognitive or environmental change may be unwarranted.
