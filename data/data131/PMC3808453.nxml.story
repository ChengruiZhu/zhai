Neurons communicate via action potentials. Typically, depolarizations caused by presynaptic firing are small, such that many synaptic inputs are necessary to exceed the firing threshold. This is the assumption made by standard mathematical approaches such as the Fokker-Planck formalism. However, in some cases the synaptic weight can be large. On occasion, a single input is capable of exceeding threshold. Although this phenomenon can be studied with computational simulations, these can be impractical for large scale brain simulations or suffer from the problem of insufficient knowledge of the relevant parameters. Improving upon the standard Fokker-Planck approach, we develop a hybrid approach combining semi-analytical with computational methods into an efficient technique for analyzing the effect that rare and large synaptic weights can have on neural network activity. Our method has both neurobiological as well as methodological implications. Sparse but powerful synapses provide networks with response celerity, enhanced bandwidth and stability, even when the networks are matched for average input. We introduce a measure characterizing this response. Furthermore, our method can characterize the sub-threshold membrane potential distribution and spiking statistics of very large networks of distinct but homogeneous populations of 10s to 100s of distinct neuronal cell types throughout the brain.
