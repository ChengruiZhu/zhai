Interstitial cells of Cajal (ICC) include several types of specialized cells within the musculature of the gastrointestinal tract (GIT). Some types of ICC act as pacemakers in the GIT musculature, whereas others are implicated in the modulation of enteric neurotransmission. Kit immunohistochemistry reliably identifies the location of these cells and provides information on changes in ICC distribution and density. Human stomach specimens were obtained from 7 embryos and 28 foetuses without gastrointestinal disorders. The specimens were 7–27 weeks of gestational age, and both sexes are represented in the sample. The specimens were exposed to anti-c-kit antibodies to investigate ICC differentiation. Enteric plexuses were immunohistochemically examined by using anti-neuron specific enolase and the differentiation of smooth muscle cells (SMC) was studied with anti-α smooth muscle actin and anti-desmin antibodies. By week 7, c-kit-immunopositive precursors formed a layer in the outer stomach wall around myenteric plexus elements. Between 9 and 11 weeks some of these precursors differentiated into ICC. ICC at the myenteric plexus level differentiated first, followed by those within the muscle layer: between SMC, at the circular and longitudinal layers, and within connective tissue septa enveloping muscle bundles. In the fourth month, all subtypes of c-kit-immunoreactivity ICC which are necessary for the generation of slow waves and their transfer to SMC have been developed. These results may help elucidate the origin of ICC and the aetiology and pathogenesis of stomach motility disorders in neonates and young children that are associated with absence or decreased number of these cells.
