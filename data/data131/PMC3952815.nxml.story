Epilepsy is a general term for conditions with recurring seizures. Absence seizures are one of several kinds of seizures, which are characterized by typical 2â€“4 Hz spike-and-slow wave discharges (SWDs). There is accumulating evidence that absence seizures are due to abnormal interactions between cerebral cortex and thalamus, and the basal ganglia may take part in controlling such brain disease via the indirect basal ganglia-thalamic pathway relaying at superior colliculus. Actually, the basal ganglia not only send indirect signals to thalamus, but also communicate with several key nuclei of thalamus through multiple direct GABAergic projections. Nevertheless, whether and how these direct pathways regulate absence seizure activities are still remain unknown. By computational modelling, we predicted that two direct inhibitory basal ganglia-thalamic pathways emitting from the substantia nigra pars reticulata may also participate in the control of absence seizures. Furthermore, we showed that these two types of seizure control can coexist in the same network, and depending on the instant network state, both lowing and increasing the activation of SNr neurons may inhibit the SWDs due to the existence of competition. Our findings emphasize the bidirectional modulation effects of basal ganglia on absence seizures, and might have physiological implications on the treatment of absence epilepsy.
