Bilateral scaphoid stress fractures are uncommon, and rarely presented with chronic wrist pain. Most fractures of the scaphoid heal with immobilization. Presentation of case The case presented here is of a bilateral stress fractures of the carpal scaphoid in a 19-year-old male.The patient had been playing as a goalkeeper and presented with a 4-year history of chronic pain in both wrists. We had a successful result in the treatment of these stress fractures with long- arm thumb plaster cast.Discussion Most fractures of the scaphoid in the immature skeleton heal with immobilization. Approximately 88–95% of acute scaphoid fractures are said to heal with conservative treatment using cast immobilisation. Non-surgical treatment is successful for scaphoid fractures in children and for those fractures which are non-displaced, stable, and where there is no damage to other bones or ligaments. In stable fractures, union is achieved within 8–12 weeks.Conclusion Bilateral stress fractures of the scaphoid can be considered for the wrist pain, especially for the patients that had repetitive minor wrist trauma, and in spite of developments in surgical techniques and materials used, treatment by plaster casting should still be considered initially for non-displaced, stable scaphoid stress fractures.
