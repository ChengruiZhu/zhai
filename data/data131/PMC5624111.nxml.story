Healthcare system reforms are pushing beyond primary care to more holistic, integrated models of community based primary health care (CBPHC) to better meet the needs of aging populations and their carers. Across the world CBPHC is at varying stages of evolution and no standard model exists. In order to scale up and spread successful models of care it is important to study what works well and why to support broader efforts to implement, scale-up and spread promising innovations. The first step in this endevour is to select appropriate cases to study. In this paper we share our adaptation of case study methodology to iteratively select models of CBPHC in three jurisdictions: Ontario, Quebec (Canada) and New Zealand. A combination of literataure searches (of empirical and gray sources) and stakeholder engagement enabled the selection of cases to study, with the latter providing the most fruitful method. We conclude that it is possible to use personal networks and experts exclusively. It is not clear how much value formal searching adds over and above expert advice. However in a situation where there is no existing definitive list of potential cases, and no acknowledged “gold standard” way to create such a list, it seems appropriate to gather cases using multiple methods and to document those methods systematically.
