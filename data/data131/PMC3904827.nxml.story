Bacteria use two-component signal transduction systems (TCSs), composed of a histidine kinase (HK) and a downstream response regulator (RR), to perceive a broad range of external stimuli and trigger an appropriate response. Prototypical HKs are transmembrane homodimeric receptors with an external sensor region coupled to a cytoplasmic catalytic core through an adaptor HAMP domain. By a mechanism that is still poorly understood, the external input signal propagates through the HAMP domain to control the activity of the catalytic domain, which adds a phosphate tag, first to the HK itself (“autophosphorylation”), ready for subsequent transfer to the RR. In this study, we report the first detailed structures of the full cytoplasmic domain of a prototypical HK, CpxA, which is involved in the detection and response to damage of the cell envelope of Escherichia coli. The structures provide snapshots of different kinase states along the autophosphorylation reaction. Our combined genetic, biochemical, and structural data point to a mechanical model for HK activation in which the input signal induces coordinated helical motions that regulate catalysis by asymmetrically repositioning the catalytic domains.
