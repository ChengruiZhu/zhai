Roberts syndrome is a human developmental disorder caused by mutations in the ESCO2 gene. This gene encodes an acetyltransferase that acetylates the cohesin ring complex to promote a locked configuration. The cohesin complex binds to many locations on chromosomes and mutations that affect its function result in changes in gene expression. In fact, Roberts syndrome and other diseases caused by mutations in cohesin are associated with differential gene expression. We wanted to understand how mutations in ESCO2 affect two important molecular pathways that detect cellular stress, the p53 and mTOR (mammalian target of rapamycin) pathways. We report that mutations in ESCO2 are associated with p53 activation and inhibition of mTOR in human cells and zebrafish. We tested the rescue effect of p53 inhibition and mTOR activation on human Roberts syndrome cells and zebrafish models for Roberts syndrome. While both treatments displayed rescue effects, the activation of mTOR provided more significant rescue. Our work suggests that stimulation of the mTOR pathway with the amino acid L-leucine has therapeutic potential for Roberts syndrome. In addition, our work suggests that some of the differential gene expression in Roberts syndrome may be explained by translational inhibition connected with the inhibition of the mTOR pathway.
