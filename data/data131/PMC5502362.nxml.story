Biological research collections holding billions of specimens world-wide provide the most important baseline information for systematic biodiversity research. Increasingly, specimen data records become available in virtual herbaria and data portals. The traditional (physical) annotation procedure fails here, so that an important pathway of research documentation and data quality control is broken. In order to create an online annotation system, we analysed, modeled and adapted traditional specimen annotation workflows. The AnnoSys system accesses collection data from either conventional web resources or the Biological Collection Access Service (BioCASe) and accepts XML-based data standards like ABCD or DarwinCore. It comprises a searchable annotation data repository, a user interface, and a subscription based message system. We describe the main components of AnnoSys and its current and planned interoperability with biodiversity data portals and networks. Details are given on the underlying architectural model, which implements the W3C OpenAnnotation model and allows the adaptation of AnnoSys to different problem domains. Advantages and disadvantages of different digital annotation and feedback approaches are discussed. For the biodiversity domain, AnnoSys proposes best practice procedures for digital annotations of complex records.
