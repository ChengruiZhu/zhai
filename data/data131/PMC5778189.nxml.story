Tissue damage of all types, such as surgical or accidental injuries, fractures, and burns, stimulates a well-orchestrated, physiological process of healing, which ultimately leads to structural and functional restoration of the damaged tissues. The tissue repair process can be broadly divided into four continuous and overlapping phasesâ€”hemostasis and coagulation, inflammation, proliferation, and remodeling. If the process is interrupted or halted during any stage, it leads to impaired healing and formation of a chronic wound. Chronic wounds are associated with significant morbidity, mortality, and poor quality of life. Therefore, prompt and effective management of acute tissue injury is necessary to prevent it from progressing to a chronic wound. Proteolytic enzymes have been used to facilitate tissue repair since ancient times. Trypsin:chymotrypsin is an oral proteolytic enzyme preparation which has been in clinical use since the 1960s. It provides better resolution of inflammatory symptoms and promotes speedier recovery of acute tissue injury than several of the other existing enzyme preparations. This review article revisits the role and clinical utility of trypsin:chymotrypsin combination in tissue repair.
