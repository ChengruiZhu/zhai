Elucidating how regulation of chromatin structure modulates gene expression patterns is fundamental for understanding mammalian development. Replacement of core histones with histone variants has recently emerged as a key mechanism for regulating chromatin states. The histone H2A variant H2A.Z is of particular interest because it is essential for embryonic development and for proper execution of developmental gene expression programs during cellular specification. ESCs provide a good model for investigating the function of H2A.Z during lineage commitment because these cells can generate an unlimited number of equivalent descendants while maintaining the capacity to differentiate into any cell type in the organism. Divergent regions in H2A.Z are likely key for functional specialization, but we know little about how these differences contribute to chromatin regulation. Here, we show that the unique H2A.Z acidic patch domain is necessary for regulation of lineage commitment during ESC differentiation by linking transcription to chromatin dynamics. Our work provides a critical foundation for elucidating how H2A.Z incorporation is key to cell fate determination. These findings are particularly important given that H2A.Z has been implicated in many diseased conditions, including cancer.
