A monoclonal antibody designated anti-Cl was obtained from a hybridoma clone isolated from a fusion of NS1 myeloma with spleen cells from BALB/c mice injected with homogenate of white matter from bovine corpus callosum. In the adult mouse neuroectoderm, C1 antigen is detectable by indirect immunohistology in the processes of Bergmann glial cells (also called Golgi epithelial cells) in the cerebellum and of Muller cells in the retina, whereas other astrocytes that express glial fibrillary acidic protein in these brain areas are negative for C1. In addition, C1 antigen is expressed in most, if not all, ependymal cells and in large blood vessels, but not capillaries. In the developing, early postnatal cerebellum, C1 antigen is not confined to Bergmann glial and ependymal cells but is additionally present in astrocytes of presumptive white matter and Purkinje cell layer. In the embryonic neuroectoderm, C1 antigen is already expressed at day 10, the earliest stage tested so far. The antigen is distinguished in radially oriented structures in telencephalon, pons, pituitary anlage, and retina. Ventricular cells are not labeled by C1 antibody at this stage. C1 antigen is not detectable in astrocytes of adult or nearly adult cerebella from the neurological mutant mice staggerer, reeler, and weaver, but is present in ependymal cells and large blood vessels. C1 antigen is expressed not only in the intact animal but also in cultured cerebellar astrocytes and fibroblastlike cells. It is localized intracellularly.
