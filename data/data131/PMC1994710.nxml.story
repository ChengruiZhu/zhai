It has been estimated that the human body contains approximately 200â€“400 distinct cell types. These estimates are largely based on the morphological characteristics of cells and have yielded, among many others, the category of smooth muscle cells, which have a distinct appearance and are present in a wide variety of tissues. By using DNA microarrays to interrogate the gene expression of anatomically varying smooth muscle cells, we were able to accurately tease apart many of the distinct cell subtypes that are classically categorized as smooth muscle cells. Remarkably, genes expressed by these newly identified, distinct subtypes corroborate many of their known biological properties and give clues about their susceptibility to specific disease states, retained developmental programs, and potential drugable targets. Additionally, from a smooth muscle cell model of vascular injury, we were able to extract a gene expression signature that provides prognostic information for human breast cancers. Of particular interest for modeling tumor progression was the finding that this gene expression signature was associated with tumor hypoxia. This study adds much to our ever-growing depth of understanding of cellular diversity and the contributions of this diversity to normal physiology and disease.
