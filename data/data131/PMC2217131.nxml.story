Na channels of frog muscle fibers treated with 100 microM veratridine became transiently modified after a train of repetitive depolarizations. They open and close reversibly with a gating process whose midpoint lies 93 mV more negative than the midpoint of normal activation gating and whose time course shows no appreciable delay in the opening or closing kinetics but still requires more than two kinetic states. Like normal activation, the voltage dependence of the modified gating can be shifted by changing the bathing Ca2+ concentration. The instantaneous current-voltage relation of veratridine-modified channels is curved at potentials negative to -90 mV, as if external Ca ions produced a voltage-dependent block but also permeated. Modified channels probably carry less current than normal ones. When the concentration of veratridine is varied between 5 and 100 microM, the initial rate of modification during a pulse train is directly proportional to the concentration, while the rate of recovery from modification after the train is unaffected. These are the properties expected if drug binding and modification of channels can be equated. Hyperpolarizations that close modified channels slow unbinding. Allethrin and DDT also modify channels. They bind and unbind far faster than veratridine does, and their binding requires open channels.
