The genetic background of cardiovascular diseases is still largely unknown. As in other complex diseases, the genetic risk is thought to consist of several genetic variants and their possible interactions. Elucidation of the genetic component of any complex trait most likely requires simultaneous examination of various genes in large and well-characterized study samples. Our study explores the role in cardiovascular disease of four thrombosis genes: coagulation factor V, intercellular adhesion molecule 1, protein C, and thrombomodulin. These genes form a physiological pathway that is part of the coagulation cascade. Their defects, such as the Leiden mutation in factor V gene, predispose to venous thrombosis, making them tempting candidates for involvement with cardiovascular events. Given the interactions of these genes at the molecular level, a logical way to explore their genetic effects is simultanous rather than gene-specific analysis of all the four genes, aiming to illustrate their possible interplay. The study setting combines classification trees with classic genetic analyses and covers all known common variants of the genes. The results imply that the variants in these four genes contribute to disease risk either alone or in various allelic combinations.
