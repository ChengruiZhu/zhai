The appropriate response of human keratinocytes to UVB is dependent on the activation status of the IGF-1 receptor. Keratinocytes grown in conditions where the IGF-1 receptor is inactive, inappropriately replicate in the presence of UVB-induced DNA damage. In human skin epidermal keratinocytes do not express IGF-1, so the IGF-1 receptor on keratinocytes is activated by IGF-1 secreted from dermal fibroblasts. We now demonstrate that the IGF-1 produced by human fibroblasts is essential for the appropriate UVB response of keratinocytes. Furthermore, the expression of IGF-1 is silenced in senescent fibroblasts in vitro. Using quantitative RT-PCR and immunohistochemisty, we can demonstrate that IGF-1 expression is also silenced in geriatric dermis in vivo. The diminished IGF-1 expression in geriatric skin correlates with an inappropriate UVB response in geriatric volunteers. Finally, the appropriate UVB response is restored in geriatric skin in vivo via pretreatment with exogenous IGF-1. These studies provide further evidence for a role of the IGF-1R in suppressing UVB-induced carcinogenesis, suggest that fibroblasts play a critical role in maintaining appropriate activation of the keratinocyte IGF-1R, and imply that reduced expression of IGF-1 in geriatric skin could be an important component in the development of aging-related non-melanoma skin cancer.
