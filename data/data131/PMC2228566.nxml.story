The receptor specificity for synaptically mediated lateral inhibition in Limulus lateral eye retina was studied by structure-activity correlations of the action of the putative indoleaminergic neurotransmitter, serotonin (5-HT), and its isomers and structural analogs, tryptamine (TRYP), 6-hydroxytryptamine (6HT), 5,6- dihydroxytryptamine (5,6-DHT), 5-hydroxydimethyltryptamine (5-HDMT), and 5-hydroxytryptophan (5-HTP). The 5-HT blockers, lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD), bromo-LSD (BOL), and cinanserin, were also tested. The inhibitory action of the indoleaminergic agonists is highly structure-specific. An hydroxyl group in the 5 position of the indole nucleus, sterically unencumbered by hydroxyls in neighboing positions, is essential. In order of decreasing potency, 5-HT, 5-HDMT, and 5-HTP are active agonists; TRYP, 6-HT, and 5,6-DHT are inactive. Configuration and mobility of the side chains of the active agonists also affect the interaction, and these side-chain characteristics correlate with agonist potency. The receptors for inhibitory action and for transmembranal transport in reuptake are different. Both active agonists and inactive analogs appear to be taken up (Adolph and Ehinger, 1975. Cell Tissue Res. 163:1-14). LSD and BOL have bimodal actions: direct inhibition and agonist blockade. These actions may be mediated via low-specificity presynaptic uptake receptor sites rather than highly specific, postsynaptic, agonist receptor sites.
