In order to convert the genetic information encoded in an organism's genomic sequence into the functional features, the genomic sequence must be transcribed. According to the current genome annotation, the human genome encodes 20,000â€“25,000 protein-coding transcripts and a smaller number of non-coding transcripts. There is, however, a growing body of evidence indicating that a much greater proportion of the human genome is transcribed than is accounted for by the existing annotation. Much of this evidence has been found using tiling arrays, microarrays that enable the measurement of transcription regardless of existing annotation. Although some have suggested that these transcripts represent previously unidentified functional RNAs as well as extensions of known genes, the extent of their functionality remains unknown. In this study, Khaitovich et al. assess the functionality of these novel transcripts by testing the extent to which their expression is conserved between humans and chimpanzees in different tissues. The results suggest that, surprisingly, the expression of both known and novel transcripts was affected by the same functional constraints during human and chimpanzee evolution.
