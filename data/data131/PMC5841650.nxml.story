BRDT, a testis-specific member of the bromodomain and extra-terminal (BET) subfamily of epigenetic reader proteins, is essential for the generation of male gametes. In post-meiotic cells, BRDT is involved in chromatin organization and transcriptional regulation through its first bromodomain motif, as loss of the BD1 results in a truncated BRDT protein that fully interrupts the differentiation of the germ cells during the process of spermiogenesis. Complete loss of BRDT function results in an arrest during meiotic prophase with no cells progressing into post-meiotic stages. However, neither the specific role of BRDT in meiosis nor the pathways affected by its depletion are known. We investigated how BRDT controls meiosis by examining its subcellular localization during prophase I as well as the meiotic consequences observed with the loss of BRDT function. BRDT localizes throughout the chromatin of autosomes and sex chromosomes in a dynamic pattern during pachynema and diplonema. Loss of BRDT severely disrupts the epigenetic reprograming and silencing of transcription of the sex chromosomes, the global and regional chromatin configuration, and the formation and localization of crossovers in spermatocytes. Thus, BRDT regulates key meiotic processes that determine the genetic and epigenetic homeostasis of the male gamete.
