 hosts, further transplantation revealed that they were antigenically C57BL/1 tumors. These experiments provide conclusive evidence for a viral etiology of GVHR-induced tumors. Furthermore, tumor induction in the GVHR does not appear to depend specifically on an immunological mechanism but is most probably due to release or activation of a sufficient quantity of oncogenic virus within a certain time period in a highly susceptible host. Comparison with radiation induction of viral leukemia in mice revealed similarities in regard to optimal host age and the spacing of administration of the tumor-inducing agent. SJL/J mice carry a type C virus which causes a high incidence of spontaneous Hodgkin-like tumors by 1 yr of age; C57BL/1 mice do not develop lymphomas spontaneously but carry a latent leukemogenic virus. Their hybrid also has a low incidence of spontaneous lymphomas. Based on the results of these and previous experiments, the viruses of these strains of mice appear to be highly synergistic in tumor induction in the GVHR. The SJL/J virus is a powerful oncogenic agent. The C57BL/1 virus may be a helper virus to the SJL/J, but is a more powerful determinant of the antigenic composition of the induced tumors. This suggests that the virus of C57BL/1 mice, when activated, is capable of controlling the C57BL/1 genome. Because of the ease and rapidity of viral tumor induction, the SJL/J and C57BL/1 strains of mice, with their F
