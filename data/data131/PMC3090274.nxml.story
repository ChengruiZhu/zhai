Revolutionary advances in nanotechnology propose novel materials with superior properties for biomedical application. One of the most promising nanomaterials for biomedical application is polyhedral oligomeric silsesquioxane (POSS), an amazing nanocage consisting of an inner inorganic framework of silicon and oxygen atoms and an outer shell of organic groups. The unique properties of this nanoparticle has led to the development of a wide range of nanostructured copolymers with significantly enhanced properties including improved mechanical, chemical, and physical characteristics. Since POSS nanomaterials are highly biocompatible, biomedical application of POSS nanostructures has been intensely explored. One of the most promising areas of application of POSS nanomaterials is the development of cardiovascular implants. The incorporation of POSS into biocompatible polymers has resulted in advanced nanocomposite materials with improved hemocompatibility, antithrombogenicity, enhanced mechanical and surface properties, calcification resistance, and reduced inflammatory response, which make these materials the material of choice for cardiovascular implants. These highly versatile POSS derivatives have opened new horizons to the field of cardiovascular implant. Currently, application of POSS containing polymers in the development of new generation cardiovascular implants including heart valve prostheses, bypass grafts, and coronary stents is under intensive investigation, with encouraging outcomes.
