Colorectal cancers from a test (n = 1197) and external validation (n = 209) cohort of MMR-proficient colorectal cancers were mounted onto single and multiple punch tissue microarrays. Immunohistochemical quantification (score 0-3) was performed for CD3, CD4, CD8, CD45RO, CD68, CD163, FoxP3, GranzymeB, iNOS, mast cell tryptase, MUM1, PD1 and TIA-1 tumor-infiltrating (TILs) reactive cells. Coexpression experiments on fresh colorectal cancer specimens using specific cell population markers were performed. In the test group, higher numbers of CD3+ (p<0.001), CD4+ (p = 0.029), CD8+ (p<0.001), CD45RO+ (p = 0.048), FoxP3+ (p<0.001), GranzymeB+ (p<0.001), iNOS+ (p = 0.035), MUM1+ (p = 0.014), PD1+ (p = 0.034) and TIA-1+ TILs (p<0.001) were linked to favourable outcome. Adjusting for age, gender, TNM stage and post-operative therapy, higher CD8+ (p<0.001; HR (95%CI): 0.66 (0.64-0.68)) and TIA-1+ (p<0.001; HR (95%CI): 0.56 (0.5-0.6)) were independent prognostic factors. Moreover, among patients with CD8+ infiltrates, TIA-1 further stratified 355 (35.6%) patients into prognostic subgroups (p<0.001; HR (95%CI): 0.89 (95%CI: 0.8-0.9)). Results were confirmed on the validation cohort (p = 0.006). TIA-1+ cells were mostly CD8+ (57%), but also stained for TCRγδ (22%), CD66b (13%) and only rarely for CD4+, macrophage and NK cell markers.
