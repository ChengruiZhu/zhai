Epigenetic drugs are chemical compounds that target disordered post-translational modification of histone proteins and DNA through enzymes, and the recognition of these changes by adaptor proteins. Epigenetic drug-related experimental data such as gene expression probed by high-throughput sequencing, co-crystal structure probed by X-RAY diffraction and binding constants probed by bio-assay have become widely available. The mining and integration of multiple kinds of data can be beneficial to drug discovery and drug repurposing. HEMD and other epigenetic databases store comprehensively epigenetic data where users can acquire segmental information of epigenetic drugs. However, some data types such as high-throughput datasets are not provide by these databases and they do not support flexible queries for epigenetic drug-related experimental data. Therefore, in reference to HEMD and other epigenetic databases, we developed a relatively comprehensive database for human epigenetic drugs. The human epigenetic drug database (HEDD) focuses on the storage and integration of epigenetic drug datasets obtained from laboratory experiments and manually curated information. The latest release of HEDD incorporates five kinds of datasets: (i) drug, (ii) target, (iii) disease, (vi) high-throughput and (v) complex. In order to facilitate data extraction, flexible search options were built in HEDD, which allowed an unlimited condition query for specific kinds of datasets using drug names, diseases and experiment types.
