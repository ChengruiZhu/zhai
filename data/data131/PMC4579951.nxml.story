The Cardiovascular Health Study is a population‐based, prospective study where participants underwent baseline echocardiogram, measurement of carotid intima‐media thickness (IMT), and various biomarkers, then followed for up to 18 years. Years of able life (YAL) constituted the number of years the participant was able to perform all activities of daily living. Linear regression was used to model the relationship between selected measures and outcomes, adjusted for confounding variables. Among 4902 participants, mean age was 72.6±5.4 years, median YAL for males was 8.8 (interquartile range [IQR], 4.3 to 13.8) and 10.3 (IQR, 5.8 to 15.8) for females. Reductions in YAL in the fully adjusted model for females and males, respectively, were: −1.34 (95% confidence interval [CI], −2.18, −0.49) and −1.41 (95% CI, −2.03, −0.8) for abnormal left ventricular (LV) ejection fraction, −0.5 (95% CI, −0.78, −0.22) and −0.62 (95% CI, −0.87, −0.36) per SD increase in LV mass, −0.5 (95% CI, −0.7, −0.29) and −0.79 (95% CI, −0.99, −0.58) for IMT, −0.5 (95% CI, −0.64, −0.37) and −0.79 (95% CI, −0.94, −0.65) for N‐terminal pro‐brain natriuretic peptide, −1.08 (95% CI, −1.34, −0.83) and −0.73 (95% CI, −0.97, −0.5) for high‐sensitivity troponin‐T, and −0.26 (95% CI, −0.42, −0.09) and −0.23 (95% CI, −0.41, −0.05) for procollagen‐III N‐terminal propeptide. Most tested variables remained significant even after adjusting for incident cardiovascular (CV) disease.
