 injection showed a more vigorous response than those on the ferritin-injected side but the reaction was qualitatively the same for both antigens. All lymph nodes contained the antigens by 2 hr after foot-pad injection. With time, both antigens lost their particulate nature sooner in conventionalized than in germfree macrophages. In the latter, both antigens persisted throughout the study while no longer demonstrable with fluoresceinated antiserum in conventional macrophages after the first week. While phagocytosis is equal in germfree and conventional mice, a greater digestive capacity of macrophages for antigens seems to result from the continuous exposure of conventional animals to the immunologic effects of the microbial flora. Conversely, the lack of substantial antigenic stimulation of lymphatic tissue in germfree animals fails to develop these macrophage functions beyond their basic ability to degrade foreign substances. Although the onset of the immune response is delayed in germfree mice, the relatively prolonged antigen digestion and the presumably slower release of immunogenic antigen fragments result in a more sustained and sometimes greater response than in conventional animals. This modifying effect of the microflora on the function of macrophages during the immune response is independent of previous experience with, or the nature of, the antigen.
