The genetic code tells us precisely how a DNA sequence will be translated into a protein. However, it is more difficult to identify where translation will start and stop in the entire length of an organism's genome sequence. Computer software can predict where the start sites are, and this is successful most of the time; however, errors do occur. We hypothesized that some errors might be corrected by comparing predictions for the genome sequences of closely related organisms. This correction scheme seems especially appropriate for bacterial genomes: not only is protein production in bacteria simpler than in higher organisms, but hundreds of bacterial DNA sequences are now available, and many of these are closely related. To test the hypothesis, we developed a method to detect whether a gene's start site is inconsistent with the majority of equivalent genes in a set of related bacterial genomes. The method then modifies the start if it can be made consistent with the majority of genomes. Our tests show this majority vote method improves the accuracy of gene start sites. Application of the method to existing bacterial genomes should eliminate many inconsistencies and correct a large number of errors.
