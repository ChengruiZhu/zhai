Our previous study revealed that S100A7 was selectively expressed in lung squamous cell carcinoma tissues but not in adenocarcinoma. Thus far, the functions of S100A7 in lung cancer have remained largely unknown. Here, we reveal that S100A7 overexpression facilitates the transdifferentiation from adenocarcinoma (ADC) to squamous carcinoma (SCC) in several lung cancer cells, which is confirmed by an increase in DNp63 expression and a decrease in thyroid transcription factor 1 (TTF1) and aspartic proteinase napsin (napsin A) expression. Further study finds that activation of the Hippo pathway induces S100A7 expression and further confirms that nuclear YAP acts as a repressor of S100A7 in H292 cells. Subsequently, we verify that TEAD1 is required for YAP transcriptional repression of S100A7. More importantly, we determine that S100A7 overexpression partially rescues lung ADC to SCC transdifferentiation inhibited by YAP overexpression in all tested cells, suggesting that S100A7 and YAP have the opposite effects on lung ADC to SCC conversion. Taken together, our study demonstrates for the first time that S100A7 not only functions as a facilitator of adenous-squamous carcinoma phenotypic transition in lung cancer cells but also that its expression is differentially regulated by the Hippo-YAP pathway.
