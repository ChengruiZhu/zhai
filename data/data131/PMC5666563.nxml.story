Cardiomyopathy involves changes in the myocardial ultra-structure, hypertrophy, apoptosis, fibrosis and inflammation. Angiotensin II (AngII) stimulates the expression of insulin like-growth factors (IGF-2) and IGF-2 receptor (IGF-2R) in H9c2 cardiomyoblasts and subsequently leads to apoptosis. Estrogen receptors protect cardiomyocytes from apoptosis and fibrosis. Tanshinone IIA (TSN), a main active ingredient from Danshen, has been shown to protect cardiomyocytes from death caused by different stress signals. Estrogen receptor α (ER) is required for the rapid activation of the IGF-1R signaling cascade. This study aimed to investigate whether TSN protected H9c2 cardiomyocytes from AngII-induced activation of IGF-2R pathway and hypertrophy via ERs. We found that AngII caused the reduction in IGF-1R phosphorylation and the elevation of β-catenin and IGF-2R levels. This was reversed by increasing doses of TSN and of caspase-3 and ERK1/2 phosphorylation mediated by ERs. The phytoestrogen significantly attenuated AngII-induced apoptosis and suppressed the subsequent cardiac remodeling effect. Therefore, TSN reduced the AngII-induced activation of β-catenin and IGF-2R pathways, apoptosis and cardiac remodeling via ERs in H9c2 cardiomyoblasts.
