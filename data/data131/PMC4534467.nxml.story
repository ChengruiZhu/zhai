High or low blood glucose levels are detrimental to human health. The hormone-secreting cells primarily responsible for maintaining glucose at physiologically appropriate levels are embedded in small clusters within the pancreas, the so-called islets of Langerhans. These islets have an irregular arrangement of cells, β cells that secrete insulin, α cells that secrete glucagon, and other cells with less well-understood functions. While the arrangement of β cells is irregular, these cells need to be touching for the islet to respond to glucose with insulin secretion. We first use a mathematical formalism called graph theory to show that cell arrangements in islets from diabetic and control donors are significantly different. The question we then address is: Is there some set of moves of islet cells that will preserve the observed arrangement? The aim is to gain insight into the biological processes by which islets are formed and maintained. We find moves on β-cell graphs that leave the same significant aspects of cell arrangements unchanged. These moves turn out to be severely restricted, and suggest that β cells may prefer to move from larger clusters but can move to a cluster of any size, possibly to maximize their exposure to blood vessels.
