Management of patients with dual diagnosis (Mental illness and substance use disorders) is a challenge. A lack of improvement in either disorder can lead to a relapse in both. The current consensus opinion favours an integrated approach to management of both the disorders wherein the same team of professionals manages both the disorders in the same setting. The role of pharmacotherapy for such dual diagnosis patients is well established but the non-pharmacological approaches for their management are still evolving. After stabilization of the acute phase of illnesses, non-pharmacological management takes centre stage. Evidence points to the beneficial effect of psychosocial approaches in maintaining abstinence, adherence to medication, maintenance of a healthy life style, better integration in to community, occupational rehabilitation and an overall improvement in functioning. Psychosocial approaches although beneficial, are difficult to implement. They require teamwork, involving professionals other than psychiatrists and psychologists alone. These approaches need to be comprehensive, individualized and require training to various levels that is difficult to achieve in most Indian settings.
