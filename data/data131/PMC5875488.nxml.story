 area, connected to simple readout electronics. Sensitivity of the sensors is determined per unit area and compared to EPID sensitivity, as well as other standard photodiodes. Each sensor independently measures dose and is based on commercially available flexible thin‐film aSi photodiodes. Readout electronics consists of an ultra low‐power microcontroller, radio frequency transmitter, and a low‐noise amplification circuit implemented on a flexible printed circuit board. Detector output is digitized and transmitted wirelessly to an external host computer where it is integrated and processed. A megavoltage medical linear accelerator (Varian Tx) equipped with kilovoltage online imaging system and a Cobalt source are use to irradiate different thin‐film detector sensors in a Solid Water phantom under various irradiation conditions. Different factors are considered in characterization of the device attributes: energies (80 kVp, 130 kVp, 6 MV, 15 MV), dose rates (different ms × mA, 100–600 MU/min), total doses (0.1 cGy‐500 cGy), depths (0.5 cm–20 cm), irradiation angles with respect to the detector surface (0°‐180°), and IMRT tests (closed MLC, sweeping gap). The detector response to MV radiation is both linear with total dose (~1‐400 cGy) and independent of dose rate (100‐600 Mu/min). The sensitivity per unit area of thin‐film sensors is lower than for aSi flat‐panel detectors, but sufficient to acquire stable and accurate signals during irradiations. The proposed thin‐film photodiode system has properties which make it promising for clinical dosimetry. Due to the mechanical flexibility of each sensor and readout electronics, low‐cost, and wireless data acquisition, it could be considered for quality assurance (e.g., IMRT, mechanical linac QA), as well as real‐time dose monitoring in challenging setup configurations, including large area and 3D detection (multiple planes or curved surfaces).
