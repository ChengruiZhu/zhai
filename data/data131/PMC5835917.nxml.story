Although nipple-sparing mastectomy (NSM) is being used more frequently, the oncological safety of NSM remains unclear, particularly in young patients (<35 years). The aim of the present study was to compare the rates of local recurrence (LR), disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS) in young patients with breast cancer who had undergone NSM or conventional mastectomy (CM). The clinicopathological data of young patients with stage 0â€“IIB breast cancer who had undergone NSM (163 cases) or CM (194 cases) between 2007 and 2016 were retrospectively analyzed. The log-rank test was used to analyze the differences in the LR, DFS and OS rates between the two groups and multivariate analysis was used to analyze the patient prognostic factors for DFS. The median follow-up time was 49 months. Patients who had undergone CM were more likely to exhibit stage II disease (68.4 vs. 58.3%; P=0.015) and positive lymph nodes (45.9 vs. 33.1%; P=0.014). In the NSM group, LR occurred in 7 (4.3%) cases, systemic recurrence in 15 (9.2%) cases and mortality in 9 (5.5%) cases. In the CM group, LR occurred in 6 (3.1%) cases, systemic recurrence in 27 (13.9%) cases and mortality in 15 (7.7%) cases. There were no statistical differences in the LR, DFS and OS rates between the two groups (P>0.05). Following adjustment for clinical stage, the LR and DFS rates between the two groups exhibited no significant differences. Analysis of the prognostic factors demonstrated that clinical stage, lymph node status, estrogen and progesterone receptor status and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 status were associated with DFS (P<0.05). NSM is safe for young patients with early-stage breast cancer and provides patients with an improved cosmetic outcome. Furthermore, nipple-areola complex preservation does not increase the risk of recurrence.
