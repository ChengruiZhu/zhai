The proto-oncogene MYC can trigger the unfolded protein response (UPR). The double-stranded RNA-activated protein kinase-like endoplasmic reticulum kinase (PERK), one of three primary branches of the UPR, is a key regulator of autophagy, promoting tumorigenesis. Upon activation of PERK, there is an increase in phosphorylation of the eukaryotic initiation factor-2 alpha (eIF2Î±), which in turn, activates the transcription factor-4 (ATF4), responsible for an increased expression of LC3, a common autophagy marker. PERK is repressed upon GLI1 and GLI2 induction. GANT-61 is an inhibitor of GLI1 and GLI2, known to reduce autophagy in MYCN non-amplified, but not in MYCN amplified neuroblastoma (NB) cells. In our study, we tested the effect of the joint administration of a PERK inhibitor (GSK2606414) and the GLI inhibitor GANT-61 to MYCN amplified and MYCN non-amplified NB cells. Our results suggest that inhibition of PERK impairs GANT-61 induced autophagy in NB cells with MYCN amplification, but had no effect on the MYCN non-amplified NB cells. In summary, PERK seems to be a good therapeutic target for NB. Inhibition of PERK reduces autophagy in MYCN amplified NB cells, thus amplifying the efficacy of the GLI inhibitor GANT-61 in reducing proliferation of this type of cancer cells.
