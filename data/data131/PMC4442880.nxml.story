The hormonal evaluation is not standardised, but initial screening tests are recommended and followed with confirmatory ones when positive, equivocal or the clinical presentation suggest adrenal hyperfunction. The imaging studies had, and continued to, advance, especially computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging and positron-emission tomography/CT. These advances have increased the accuracy of the diagnosis of adrenal masses, with a reported high sensitivity and specificity of 95–100%. The introduction of laparoscopy has resulted in more adrenal lesions being removed, especially incidental lesions smaller than the 5–6 cm that was previously the indication for surgical excision. The technique has developed and larger lesions of >6 cm are now considered for LA in the proper setting. The transperitoneal and retroperitoneal approaches are currently widely practised, with minor differences in the outcome. The reported outcome, although mostly retrospective, is excellent and with fewer complications. The role of LA for adrenal malignancy should be considered cautiously. Preoperative imaging signs of invasion into surrounding structures should be considered a contraindication for LA.
