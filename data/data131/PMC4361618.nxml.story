Eukaryotic genomes from yeast to man express numerous non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) that regulate the expression of messenger RNAs (mRNAs) encoding the proteins vital for cell and body function. As faulty ncRNAs impair mRNA expression and contribute to cancers and neurodegenerative disease, it is imperative to understand how ncRNAs are processed and/or degraded. In budding yeast, a conserved RNA shredding machine known as the exosome nibbles at or destroys ncRNAs. The exosome is assisted by a conserved TRAMP exosome cofactor that recruits the exosome to ncRNAs for processing/ degradation. To better understand TRAMP function, we performed a genetic screen to identify genes that improve the growth of TRAMP mutant yeast cells that grow poorly at high temperature. We find that overexpression of the Nab3 RNA binding protein, which belongs to another exosome cofactor, the Nrd1-Nab3-Sen1 (NNS) complex, improves the growth of TRAMP mutant cells. Importantly, Nab3 requires the exosome to improve the growth and ncRNA processing of TRAMP mutant cells. We therefore suggest that Nab3 facilitates TRAMP function by recruiting the exosome to ncRNAs for processing/degradation. We also show that the human RNA binding protein, RALY, like Nab3, can improve the growth of TRAMP mutant cells.
