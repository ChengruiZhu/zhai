 = 237), the proportion of relapse-free patients increased from 47 patients (19.6 %; 95 % confidence interval [CI] 14.8–25.2) in the year before fingolimod initiation to 152 patients (64.1 %; 95 % CI 58.0–70.2) after 1 year of fingolimod treatment. Of the 85 patients who experienced at least one relapse after 1 year of fingolimod treatment, 53 (62.4 %; 95 % CI 51.7–71.9) reported only one relapse, while 25 (29.4 %; 95 % CI 20.8–39.8) and seven (8.2 %; 95 % CI 4.0–16.0) patients had ≥2 relapses, respectively. No significant changes were observed in EDSS scores over the 12-month treatment period compared with baseline. The absolute number of relapses during 2 years before initiation of fingolimod treatment and baseline EDSS scores were identified as significant independent predictors for ‘being relapse-free’ during the 12-month fingolimod treatment period. No trend was established in work capability or number of missed days at work due to the large proportion of missing data. Of 240 enrolled patients, 27 (11.3 %) patients discontinued the study at or before the 12-month visit, 16 (6.7 %) discontinued because of adverse events related to study drug. Only six (2.5 %) patients reported serious adverse events related to the study drug.
