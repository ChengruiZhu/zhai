The protracted absence of muscle activation initiates complex cellular and molecular reactions aimed at restoring functional neuromuscular transmission and preventing degenerative processes. A central aspect of these reactions is the sprouting of intramuscular nerves in the vicinity of inactivated muscle fibers. Sprouts emerging from terminal nerve branches and nodes of Ranvier can reestablish functional contacts with inactive muscle fibers, and this is an essential restorative process in pathological conditions of the neuromuscular system. Due to their rapid upregulation in inactive skeletal muscle fibers and their ability to induce nerve sprouting in adult muscle, insulin-like growth factors (IGFs) are candidate signaling molecules to promote restorative reactions in the neuromuscular system. In this study we have exploited the high affinity and specificity of IGF-binding protein 4 (IGF-BP4) and IGF-BP5 for IGF1 and IGF2 to determine whether these growth factors are involved in the nerve sprouting reaction in paralyzed skeletal muscle. In tissue culture experiments with sensory- and motoneurons we demonstrate that the neurite promoting activity of IGF1 is blocked by IGF-BP4, and that a similar IGF-BP-sensitive activity is detected in muscle extracts from paralyzed, but not from control muscle. In in vivo experiments, we show that local delivery of IGF-BP4 to Botulinum toxin A-paralyzed skeletal muscle effectively prevents nerve sprouting in that muscle. Our findings indicate that muscle IGFs play an essential role in intramuscular nerve sprouting. In addition, these findings suggest that IGFs are major signaling factors from inactivated muscle to promote local restorative reactions, including interstitial cell proliferation and nerve sprouting.
