Pheohyphomycosis is a rare heterogeneous group of mycotic infections caused by dermatiaceous (phaeoid) fungi affecting the skin, subcutaneous tissue, and the central nervous system.Involvement of the face is extremely rare, and very few cases have been reported in India so far. We reporta case of phaeohyphomycosisin a 45-year-old female with 1-year history of a well- defined hypertrophic plaque over the right cheek advancing towards the forehead. The lesion was ulcerated with rolled-up margins; a provisional clinical diagnosis of basal cell carcinoma was given. Histopathology of the skin biopsy revealed numerous multinucleated giant cells and fungal hyphae with in and in between the giant cells. Various histochemical stains were used toconfirm the presence of fungal hyphae. Melanin pigment in the fungus was demonstrated with Masson's Fontana stain. Based on the histopathological and histochemical findings, a diagnosis of phaeohyphomycosis was given and it was concluded that the disease was more of a histopathological than clinical diagnosis. This case is being reported due to its unusual presentation and it also highlights the importance of histopathology in the diagnosis of this rare disease.
