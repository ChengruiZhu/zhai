Murine thymus derived (T) lymphocytes primed in vivo to mouse 129 (H- 2bc) derived H-2-negative F9 embryonal carcinoma cells and rechallenged in vitro with X-irradiated F9 stimulator cells differentiated into anti- F9 cell immune cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL). Using CBA mouse derived splenic responder T cells, F9 stimulator cells triggered a primary cytotoxic anti-F9 response. The CTL generated lysed the F9 antigen- positive target cells F9. PCC3 and PCC4, but not the F9 antigen- negative mouse 129 derived PYS tumor cells, nor LPS induced H-2bc blast cells. Mouse 129 anti-F9 cell antisera but not H-2k anti-H-2bc antisera blocked the lytic interaction with F9 target cells. Similarily unlabeled F9 cells but not H-2bc blast cells inhibited the anti-F9 cell cytotoxicity H-2k anti-F9 cell immune CTL were found to be cytotoxic for syngeneic spermatogonia, known to express the F9 antigen. The results suggest not only that CTL can recognize and lyse H-2-negative target cells, but also that CTL precursors can be sensitized against H- 2-negative stimulator cells. From the data available it may be inferred that anti-F9 Cell immune CTL recognize the F9 antigen, known to be linked with the T/t locus. Since anti-F9 cell immune CTL lyse syngeneic spermatogonia, the system may be useful to analyze in vitro the induction and effector phase of a T-cell-mediated cytotoxic autoimmune orchitis.
