Managing patients with chronic pelvic pain syndrome (CPPS) refractory to the traditional 3-As therapy (antibiotics, alpha-blockers, and anti-inflammatories) is a challenging task. Low-intensity extracorporeal shock wave therapy (LI-ESWT) was recently reported to be able to improve pain, urinary symptoms, and even sexual function by inducing neovascularization and anti-inflammation, reducing muscle tone, and influencing nerve impulses. This study evaluates whether combined treatment with LI-ESWT can restore clinical ability and quality of life (QoL) in patients refractory to 3-As therapy. This was an open-label, single-arm prospective study. Patients with CPPS without more than a 6-point decrease in the National Institutes of Health Chronic Prostatitis Symptom Index (NIH-CPSI) total score under the maximal dosage of 3-As therapy were enrolled. LI-ESWT treatment consisted of 3,000 shock waves administered once weekly for 4 weeks. The NIH-CPSI, visual analog scale (VAS) score, International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS), and the five-item version of the International Index of Erectile Function (IIEF-5) were used to evaluate efficacy at 1, 4, and 12 weeks after LI-ESWT. Thirty-three patients were enrolled in this study. After LI-ESWT treatment, 27 of the 33 patients (81.82%) had a successful response to LI-ESWT, with a decrease of 3.29 and 5.97 in the VAS score and total IPSS at the 3-month follow-up. Waist circumference was the only significant predictor of a successful response to LI-ESWT. LI-ESWT can serve as a salvage therapy for patients with CPPS refractory to traditional 3-As therapy. Further studies are needed to determine an adequate therapeutic protocol and important predictors in patients with different CPPS etiologies.
