When a sperm meets an egg, it must display the correct recognition proteins to achieve fertilization. Given the importance of fertilization one would think these proteins are perfected and do not change over time; however, recent studies show that they do change and quite rapidly. Thus, the sperm and egg must change together in harmony, through a process called coevolution, so the species can successfully reproduce. We followed the spermâ€“egg coevolutionary process at the level of genes: one that makes the protective egg coat and a sperm gene which opens that coat for fertilization. By examining their DNA sequences in two abalone species, we revealed two coevolutionary signatures. In one case, we discovered an association of variants between the egg and sperm genes, the origin of which could be strong preference for compatible variants. In the second case, we demonstrated that both genes changed at correlated rates over millions of years of evolution. Whenever one gene had accelerated in one species, the other showed a parallel acceleration in that same species. These unique signatures help us to understand coevolution by revealing its strength within natural populations and by showing that it has acted consistently over long time periods.
