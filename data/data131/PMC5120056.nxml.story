While the past decades have seen a dramatic increase in the number of women who gamble and develop consequent problems, treatment services are being underutilized in Ontario. This pilot study explores the feasibility of using web- and phone-based group interventions to expand services available for women who might not otherwise seek or be able to access treatment. Distinct treatment considerations for working with women, such as the value of a womenâ€™s group, advantages of phone counselling, and the implementation of modern web-based services, were reviewed. The study involved a clinician-facilitated group that used teleconferencing and webinar technology (Adobe Connect) for support and discussion, and a Tutorial Workbook (TW) developed specifically to address the issues and treatment needs of women who gamble at a problematic level. A mixed method analysis used to evaluate the results suggested that the group-based teleconference/webinar approach provided a much-needed means of treatment support for women. Participants reported that the program helped them to understand their gambling triggers, to improve their awareness, to feel better about themselves, to modify their mood and anxiety levels, to feel less isolated, to address their relationships, and to feel more hopeful for the future. The Tutorial Workbook, which was used to supplement the educational component of the group interaction, was highly rated.
