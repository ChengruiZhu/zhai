For some time, cancer has not been thought of as a disease, but as a multifaceted, heterogeneous complex of genotypic and phenotypic manifestations leading to tumorigenesis. Due to recent technological progress, the outcome of cancer patients can be greatly improved by introducing in clinical practice the advantages brought about by the development of next generation sequencing techniques. Biomedical suppliers have come up with various applications which medical researchers can use to characterize a patientâ€™s disease from molecular and genetic point of view in order to provide caregivers with rapid and relevant information to guide them in choosing the most appropriate course of treatment, with maximum efficiency and minimal side effects. Breast cancer, whose incidence has risen dramatically, is a good candidate for these novel diagnosis and therapeutic approaches, particularly when referring to specific sequencing panels which are designed to detect germline or somatic mutations in genes that are involved in breast cancer tumorigenesis and progression. Benchtop next generation sequencing machines are becoming a more common presence in the clinical setting, empowering physicians to better treat their patients, by offering early diagnosis alternatives, targeted remedies, and bringing medicine a step closer to achieving its ultimate goal, personalized therapy.
