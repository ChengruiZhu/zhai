In the present study, a comprehensive and systematic strategy was described to evaluate the performance of several three-way calibration methods on a bio-analytical problem. Parallel factor analysis (PARAFAC), alternating trilinear decomposition (ATLD), self-weighted alternating trilinear decomposition (SWATLD), alternating penalty trilinear decomposition (APTLD), and unfolded partial least squares combined with the residual bilinearization procedure (U-PLS/RBL) were applied on high performance liquid chromatography with photodiode-array detection (HPLC-DAD) data to quantify carbamazepine (CBZ) in different serum samples. Using the proposed approach, successfully quantification of CBZ in human plasma, even in the presence of diverse uncalibrated serious interfering components was achieved. Moreover, the accuracy and precision of each algorithm for analyzing CBZ in serum samples were compared using root mean square error of prediction (RMSEP), the recovery values and figures of merits and reproducibility of the analysis. Satisfying recovery values for the analyte of interest were obtained by HPLC-DAD on a Bonus-RP column using an isocratic mode of elution with acetonitrile/K2HPO4 (pH = 7.5) buffer solution (45:55) coupled with second-order calibrations. Decreas of the analysis time and less solvent consumption are some of the pluses of this method. The analysis of real samples showed that the modeling of complex chromatographic profiles containing CBZ as the target drug using any of the mentioned algorithms can be potentially benefit drug monitoring in therapeutic research.
