This study explored the predictive values of diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) and perfusion-weighted imaging (PWI) in evaluating the efficacy of transcatheter arterial chemoembolization (TACE) for patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). A total of 118 HCC patients treated with TACE were selected from April 2013 to November 2015. T1-weighted imaging (T1WI)/T2-weighted imaging (T2WI), DWI, and PWI were performed on all patients before and after TACE. Efficacy was evaluated according to modified Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors 1.1. Receiver operating characteristic curve was used to evaluate the diagnostic power of quantitative DWI and PWI parameters in evaluating the efficacy of TACE for HCC patients. Among the 118 HCC patients, there were 17 cases (14.4%) with complete response, 50 cases (42.4%) with partial response, 28 cases (23.7%) with stable disease, and 23 cases (19.5%) with progressive disease. There were 67 patients in the effective group (complete response + partial response) and 51 patients in the ineffective group (stable disease + progressive disease). Before TACE, there were significant differences in maximum tumor diameter (MTD), apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC), slow ADC (
