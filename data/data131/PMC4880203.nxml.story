A new mixed-model was recently developed for mapping DNA regions that are associated with variations in observable traits, known as quantitative trait loci. This model incorporates multiple polygenic covariance genetic structures and has been used to successfully predict yield in hybrid rice. However, quantitatively examining interactions between multiple genetic elements, i.e. epistatic effects, across the entire genome is computationally demanding, which greatly hinders real-world applications of the model, especially in evaluating large populations and multiple genetic markers. In order to overcome these computational challenges, we developed a tool known as the PEPISâ€”Pipeline for estimating EPIStatic genetic effects in genome wide. We implemented the PEPIS in efficient C/C++ programming language and successfully incorporated several highly efficient open-source mathematical operation and optimization libraries to perform the computational demanding mathematical matrix operations required for these types of analyses. Furthermore, the computational demand is distributed across multiple nodes on our networked Linux computing cluster in order to increase the speed of analyses. Our PEPIS tool will thus help overcome the bottleneck in genetic epistasis analysis.
