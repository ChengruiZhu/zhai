Sprouting regulation in potato tubers is important for improving commercial value and producing new plants. Camphor shows flexible inhibition of tuber sprouting and prolongs the storage period of potato, but its underlying mechanism remains unknown. The results of the present study suggest that camphor inhibition caused bud growth deformities and necrosis, but after moving to more ventilated conditions, new sprouts grew from the bud eye of the tuber. Subsequently, the sucrose and fructose contents as well as polyphenol oxidase (PPO) activity were assessed after camphor inhibition. Transcription and proteomics data from dormancy (D), sprouting (S), camphor inhibition (C), and recovery sprouting (R) samples showed changes in the expression levels of approximately 4000 transcripts, and 700 proteins showed different abundances. KEGG (Kyoto encyclopaedia of genes and genomes) pathway analysis of the transcription levels indicated that phytohormone synthesis and signal transduction play important roles in tuber sprouting. Camphor inhibited these processes, particularly for gibberellic acid, brassinosteroids, and ethylene, leading to dysregulation of physiological processes such as cutin, suberine and wax biosynthesis, fatty acid elongation, phenylpropanoid biosynthesis, and starch and sucrose metabolism, resulting in bud necrosis and prolonged storage periods. The KEGG pathway correlation between transcripts and proteins revealed that terpenoid backbone biosynthesis and plantâ€“pathogen interaction pathways showed significant differences in D vs. S samples, but 13 pathways were remarkably different in the D vs. C groups, as camphor inhibition significantly increased both the transcription levels and protein abundance of pathogenesis-related protein PR-10a (or STH-2), the pathogenesis-related P2-like precursor protein, and the kirola-like protein as compared to sprouting. In recovery sprouting, these genes and proteins were decreased at both the transcriptional level and in protein abundance. It was important to find that the inhibitory effect of camphor on potato tuber sprout was reversible, revealing the action mechanism was similar to resistance to pathogen infection. The present study provides a theoretical basis for the application of camphor in prolonging seed potato storage.
