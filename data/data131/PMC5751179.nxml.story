Glioblastoma is a highly aggressive primary brain tumour, renowned for its infiltrative growth and varied genetic profiles. The current treatment options are insufficient, and their off-target effects greatly reduce patient quality of life. The major challenge in improving glioblastoma diagnosis and treatment involves the development of a targeted imaging and drug delivery platform, capable of circumventing the blood brain barrier and specifically targeting glioblastoma tumours. The unique properties of aptamers demonstrate their capability of bridging the gap to the development of successful diagnosis and treatment options, where antibodies have previously failed. Aptamers possess many characteristics that make them an ideal novel imaging and therapeutic agent for the treatment of glioblastoma and other brain malignancies, and are likely to provide patients with a better standard of care and improved quality of life. Their target sensitivity, selective nature, ease of modification and low immunogenicity make them an ideal drug-delivery platform. This review article summarises the aptamers previously generated against glioblastoma cells or its identified biomarkers, and their potential application in diagnosis and therapeutic targeting of glioblastoma tumours.
