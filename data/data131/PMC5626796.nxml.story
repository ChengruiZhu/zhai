 < 0.0001, respectively). Supernatants from activated macrophages increased the adhesion of tumour cells to lymphatic and blood endothelium. Secretion of IL-1β was caspase-1 dependent, and treatment with caspase-1 inhibitor reduced IL-1β production by 73% and concomitantly reduced tumour cell adhesion to levels obtained with resting macrophages. Transmigration of MDA-MB-231 cells across blood and lymphatic endothelial monolayers was significantly increased following IL-1β stimulation. Furthermore, supernatants from activated macrophages increased transmigration of MDA-MB-231 cells across endothelial monolayers, which was abolished by caspase-1 inhibition. IL-1β stimulation of tumour cells significantly increased their migratory ability and a significant increase in migration was observed when MDA-MB-231 cells were stimulated with macrophage conditioned media (two of three donors). Results demonstrate that macrophage production of IL-1β plays an important role in the migration of breast cancer cells and their adhesion to, and transmigration across, blood and lymphatic endothelial cells. Results suggest that IL-1β may play a role in the adhesion to lymphatic endothelial cells in particular.
