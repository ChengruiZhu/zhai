Intrinsically disordered proteins/regions do not adopt well-defined three dimensional structures; instead, they function as conformational ensembles. They are distinguished in molecular recognition and involved in various regulatory processes. Several components in the transcription machinery–for example, the transactivator domains of transcription factors–are disordered. Mediator, which is a large complex that transduces regulatory information from activators/repressors to the core apparatus, was found to contain a preponderance of intrinsically disordered regions in its various subunits. Such disordered regions are commonly involved in conformational changes coupled to functional transitions, in protein–protein interactions, or in posttranslational modifications. Several such predicted recognition sites were in good agreement with experimental data. Intrinsically disordered regions illuminate a novel aspect of Mediator's regulation and could explain its versatility and specificity in handling transcriptional signals. Their integral role in Mediator function is further underscored by the conserved arrangements of ordered/disordered segments and of the embedded interaction sites.
