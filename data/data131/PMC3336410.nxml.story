The objective of this study as to determine the anti-atherogenic effect of cardiproa poly herbal cardiotonic which primarily contains the standardized extracts of Terminalia arjuna, Ocimum sanctum, Boerhaavia diffusa, Emblica officinalis and withania somnifera. For this purpose, 24 adult wistar albino rats were equally divided into 4 groups. Group I acted as control, Group 2 received individually cholesterol 100mg/kg dissolved in vegetable oil (4mg/ml) orally daily for 30 days. Group 3 received cardiPro 25 mg/kg body weight individually orally dissolved in distilled water daily for 30 days in combination with cholesterol as in group2, wile group 4 instead received Cardipro @ 50mg/kg body weight along with cholesterol. It was found that plasma total lipid, cholesterol, low density lipids, very low density lipids, triglycerides as well as aortic cholesterol contents were higher in cholesterol fed rats in comparison to health controls. Treatment with Cardipro significant; reduced the levels of these blood lipid profiles suggesting anti-atherogenic action of cardipro in rats. This was further strengthened b histopathological examination of Aorta in which the cholesterol fed rats treated with Cardipro @ 50% mg/kg body weight revealed only occasional presence of fat in the medial coat and intact elastic fibres in contrest to marked elevations and depressions I the tunica intima associated muscles of medical coat and disruption of elastic fibres in only cholesterol fed rats.
