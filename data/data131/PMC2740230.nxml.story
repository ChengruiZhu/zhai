Tc-pertechnetate revealed an autonomous left nodule with suppression of the surrounding parenchyma. Pituitary investigation showed partial hypopituitarism associated to increased prolactin levels: 182-200 ng/ml. Magnetic resonance imaging revealed a large (2.2 cm) invasive macroadenoma. To avoid a possible high-dose hook effect, the patient's serum was diluted; the resulting PRL levels of around 1800 ng/ml prompted the final diagnosis of macroprolactinoma. Reduced libido and erectile dysfunction were ascertained. In addition to replacement therapy with L-thyroxine and testosterone, cabergoline was started and was progressively increased to high doses (4 g/week); this yielded a significant but incomplete reduction of PRL levels (63-99 ng/ml). Sexual function improved. The macroadenoma shrank over the first two years of therapy, but subsequently enlarged slightly. Following stereotactic radiosurgery, the tumor stabilized and prolactin almost normalized (22 ng/ml) on therapy. Over the years, thyroid nodule volume was unmodified, but hyperthyroidism on L-thyroxine therapy was found, and increased FT3 levels with suppressed thyroid stimulating hormone levels were confirmed off-therapy. Thyroid scan confirmed the left autonomous nodule, which was successfully treated with methimazole.
