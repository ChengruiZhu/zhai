A 10-year-old female patient, being treated for dystrophic bullous epidermolysis in a Pediatric Hospital, was referred to our Dermoscopy Ambulatory because of a newly observed mole in the submandibular area. Clinically, the lesion presented as an irregular double-colored macule of about 2 cm in diameter, with irregular borders, suspicious of malignancy. Dermoscopy showed a multicomponent pattern, with multiple colors, ill-defined network, black blotches, streaks, multiple dots, a blue-whitish veil and granularity at the periphery. Although it had a clinical appearance of malignancy, dermoscopy every semester was proposed due to the revision of a recently described entity, named bullous epidermolysis nevi, that we made in these children. The fragile skin of this particular patient was also taken into account, and overtreatment was avoided. Bullous epidermolysis nevi is the term given to large, asymmetrical and often irregularly pigmented melanocytic nevi that occur in former areas of blistering in patients with the dystrophic forms of the disease. Despite its atypical clinical appearance, and sometimes also atypical dermoscopy, malignant transformation has not been reported yet. Similarly to recurrent nevi, where melanocytes proliferate in a previous area of trauma, clinical aspect, dermoscopy, and histopathology may tempt clinicians to diagnose benign moles as melanoma. Here we report one case of this entity, scarcely reported on in literature, and review clinical and dermatoscopical features of epidermolysis bullosa nevi confronting it with recurrent nevi. The usefulness of dermoscopy as a treatment strategy is stressed.
