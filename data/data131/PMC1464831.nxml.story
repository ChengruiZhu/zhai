Genetic models to explain the obesity epidemic are inadequate because the emergence of this epidemic over the past 30 y has been too rapid to allow for the appearance of new mutant genes. The authors show that diet-induced obesity among genetically identical mice is characterized by highly variable and stable phenotypes that are established in mice early in life, even before they become exposed to an obesogenic environment. Furthermore, strong associations occur between susceptibility to obesity and the expression of genes implicated in processes that regulate cellular development. Previous studies have shown that abnormal regulation of such genes by epigenetic mechanisms is linked with the development of cancer. Epigenetic mechanisms involve chemical processes that change chromatin structure and gene expression without changing the genetic code. Accordingly, epigenetic modifications of gene structure through nutritional and physiological stress provide mechanisms for inducing obesity that are independent of new mutations to the genome. Experimental models based upon genetically identical mice provide powerful tools for identifying epigenetic and environmental mechanisms causing obesity and other chronic diseases.
