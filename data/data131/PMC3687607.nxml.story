Immunochemical measurement of serum 17α-hydroxyprogesterone (17OHP), the most important parameter for diagnosis of classical 21-hydroxylase deficiency (21OHD) in newborn infants, is known to be inaccurate due to the cross-reactivity of antibodies with a large quantity of fetal adrenal steroids. The aims of this study were 1) to establish reference values for the serum 17OHP level in Japanese newborn infants using non-immunochemical stable isotope dilution —gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (SID-GC/MS) and 2) to compare the serum 17OHP levels determined by SID-GC/MS with those determined by radioimmunoassay (RIA). The first study subjects were used for determination of reference values and included 57 healthy full-term newborn infants (4–5 d of age). The second study subjects were used for comparison of SID-GC/MS with RIA and included 27 healthy full-term newborn infants (3–6 d of age) and two subjects with neonatal transient hyper 17OHPnemia; these two subjects were 16 and 27 d of age, respectively. In the first study subjects, the intra-assay coefficient of variation for SID-GC/MS was 3% (n=5), the recovery rate was 98%, the sensitivity was 0.2 ng/ml, and the range of linearity was 0.5–200 ng/ml. The reference values for the serum 17OHP level determined by SID-GC/MS ranged from 0.3–1.5 (0.6) (ng/ml) (median). In the second study subjects, the serum 17OHP levels determined by SID-GC/MS were lower in one of the 27 subjects and both of the two subjects with neonatal transient hyper 17OHPnemia compared with the levels determined by RIA. Measurement of the serum 17OHP level using SID-GC/MS may be clinically useful for definitive diagnosis of classical 21OHD in newborn infants.
