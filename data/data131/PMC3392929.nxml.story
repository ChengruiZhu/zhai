Addition of actin monomer (G-actin) to growing actin filaments (F-actin) at the leading edge generates force for cell locomotion. The polymerization reaction and its regulation have been studied in depth. However, the mechanism responsible for transport of G-actin substrate to the cell front is largely unknown; random diffusion, facilitated transport via myosin II contraction, local synthesis as a result of messenger ribonucleic acid localization, or F-actin turnover all might contribute. By tracking a photoactivatable, nonpolymerizable actin mutant, we show vectorial transport of G-actin in live migrating endothelial cells (ECs). Mass spectrometric analysis identified Myo1c, an unconventional F-actin–binding motor protein, as a major G-actin–interacting protein. The cargo-binding tail domain of Myo1c interacted with G-actin, and the motor domain was required for the transport. Local microinjection of Myo1c promoted G-actin accumulation and plasma membrane ruffling, and Myo1c knockdown confirmed its contribution to G-actin delivery to the leading edge and for cell motility. In addition, there is no obvious requirement for myosin II contractile–based transport of G-actin in ECs. Thus, Myo1c-facilitated G-actin transport might be a critical node for control of cell polarity and motility.
