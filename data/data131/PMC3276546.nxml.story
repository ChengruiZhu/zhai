The forensic identification of criminal suspects through DNA profiling is now common in the United States. Indirect identification by familial DNA profiling is increasingly proposed to extend the utility of DNA databases. In familial searching, a DNA profile from a crime scene partially matches a database profile entry, implicating close relatives of the partial match. While the basic principles behind familial searching methods are simple and elegant, statistical confidence that a partially matched profile belongs to a true genetic relative has not been fully explored. Here, we derive relative identification likelihood ratio statistics and consider how the ability of familial searching to distinguish relatives from unrelated individuals varies over population samples and is affected by inaccurately assumed population background. We observe lower relationship distinguishability for population samples with less identifying information in the genetic loci considered. Additionally, we show that relationship distinguishability decreases with discordance between true and assumed population samples. These results indicate that, if an inappropriate genetic population group is assumed, individuals from certain marginalized groups may be disproportionately more often subject to false familial identification. Our results suggest that care is warranted in the use and interpretation of familial searching forensic techniques.
