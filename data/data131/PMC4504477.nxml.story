In RNA interference, Argonaute proteins and microRNAs together form the functional core that regulates the gene expression with high sequence specificity. Elucidating the detailed mechanism of molecular recognition between Argonaute proteins and microRNAs is thus important not only for the fundamental understanding of RNA interference, but also for the further development of microRNA-based therapeutic application. In this work, we propose a two-step model to understand the mechanism of microRNA loading into human Argonaute-2: selective binding followed by structural re-arrangement. Our model is based on the results from a combined approach of molecular dynamics simulations, Markov State Models and protein-RNA docking. In particular, we identify a metastable open state of apo hAgo2 in rapid equilibrium with other states. Some of conformations in this open state have largely exposed RNA binding groove that can accommodate microRNA. We further show that the initial Argonaute-microRNA binding complex undergoes structural re-arrangement to reach stable binary crystal structure. These results provide novel insights into the underlying mechanism of Argonaute-microRNA recognition. In addition, our method is readily applicable to the investigation of other complex molecular recognition events such as protein-protein interactions and protein-ligand binding.
