Cell cycles, ordered series of events modulating cell growth and division, are tightly regulated by complexes containing cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) and cyclins. Cyclin O is a novel cyclin family protein which interacts with CDK2. However, the molecular effects of cyclin O on the activity of CDK2 have not been fully evaluated. In this study, an interaction between cyclin O and CDK2 was identified by co-immunoprecipitation and the effect of cyclin O on the kinase activity of CDK2 was investigated using cyclin O point mutants. Co-immunoprecipitation was achieved using using HEK293 human embryonic kidney cells which were transiently transfected with vectors expressing cyclin O and CDK2, which revealed that cyclin O interacted with CDK2, particularly with the active form of endogenous CDK2. Cyclin O was expressed as several different bands with molecular weights between 45 and 50 kDa, possibly due to different post-translational modifications. When co-expressed with CDK2, cyclin O appeared as a band with a molecular weight of 50 kDa. Treatment with calf intestinal phosphatase reduced the intensity of the uppermost band. Mass spectroscopic analysis of cyclin O co-expressed with CDK2 revealed that the 81st serine residue of cyclin O was phosphorylated. The
