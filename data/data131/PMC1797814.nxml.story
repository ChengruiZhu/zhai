A species is usually defined as such because it cannot exchange its genes with other species. Closely related species may attempt to breed but be unsuccessful. A common example of this occurs when a donkey mates with a horse. The offspring of this mating is a hybrid called a mule. Mules are sterile and cannot reproduce, so donkeys and horses are maintained as distinct speciesâ€”they cannot exchange genes. Understanding what makes hybrids sterile could tell us how new species originate. Instead of mules, this study examines yeast hybrids that are sterile because the sex cells (the yeast equivalent of sperms or eggs) they produce are dead. One possible reason for this is that the genes from the different species fail to work together in the sex cells, killing them. To test this idea, I replaced individual chromosomes in one species' sex cells with chromosomes from another species. Surprisingly, this did not kill the gametes, showing that the genes from one species can work fine with the genes of another. Not all the genes could be tested in this way, but nevertheless it seems likely that the death of sex cells produced by yeast hybrids is caused by something other than failure of the genes from different species to work together.
