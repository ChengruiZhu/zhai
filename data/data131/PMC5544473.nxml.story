Recent strategies for the treatment of cancer, other than just tumor cell killing have been under intensive development, such as anti-angiogenic therapeutic approach. Angiogenesis inhibition is an important strategy for the treatment of solid tumors, which basically depends on cutting off the blood supply to tumor micro-regions, resulting in pan-hypoxia and pan-necrosis within solid tumor tissues. The differential activation of angiogenesis between normal and tumor tissues makes this process an attractive strategic target for anti-tumor drug discovery. The principles of anti-angiogenic treatment for solid tumors were originally proposed in 1972, and ever since, it has become a putative target for therapies directed against solid tumors. In the early twenty first century, the FDA approved anti-angiogenic drugs, such as bevacizumab and sorafenib for the treatment of several solid tumors. Over the past two decades, researches have continued to improve the performance of anti-angiogenic drugs, describe their drug interaction potential, and uncover possible reasons for potential treatment resistance. Herein, we present an update to the pre-clinical and clinical situations of anti-angiogenic agents and discuss the most recent trends in this field.
