Pica has been reported widely in pediatric age group and often found to be co existing with obsessive compulsive or major depressive disorder.

On query it was known that the lady is having same sex relationship over years. There unique conglomeration of cultural, psychodynamic and physiological determinants which together is responsible for this unusual habit of this lady. Moreover the onset of the disease at a late age and different psychodynamic issues make the case all the more interesting.
