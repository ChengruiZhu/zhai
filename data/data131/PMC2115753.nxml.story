The expression of mRNAs for the RI alpha, RII alpha, and C alpha subunits of cAMP-dependent protein kinase has been studied in different ram germ cells. The sizes of the specific RI alpha, RII alpha, and C alpha mRNAs, observed in germ cells were 1.6, 2.0, and 2.6 kb, respectively. RI alpha and C alpha mRNAs were mainly expressed in primary spermatocytes. A postmeiotic expression predominating in early spermatids was unique to RII alpha mRNA. The location of RI, RII alpha, and C subunits in well-defined organelles of ram spermatids and epididymal sperm was assessed by immunogold electron microscopy. In spermatids, RI, RII alpha, and C were essentially present in the forming acrosome and, to a lesser extent, in the nucleus. During sperm epididymal maturation, the protein kinases disappeared from the acrosome and were detected in a variety of sperm functional areas, such as the tip of the acrosome, the motility apparatus, and the membrane network. The present study on subunits of cAMP-dependent protein kinase supports the concept that specific functions are attached to the different subunits in that it shows differential expression and differential subcellular localization in germ cells.
