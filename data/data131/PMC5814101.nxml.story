Can the wealth of information from animal studies on the structure and connections of the cerebral cortex—the brain’s outer rim—be translated to understand neural communication in humans and disruption in brain diseases? To address this question, we examined the prefrontal cortex, which is associated with attention, emotions, and executive control—functions that are disrupted in psychiatric and neurologic diseases. We compared the architecture of the human and rhesus monkey cortex, using identical methods in both species to maximize the accuracy of comparisons. High-resolution microscopy revealed features of gray matter regions, made up of many cells, as well as of the white matter beneath, which contains axons that form connections between brain regions. We found that the architecture of the gray and white matter in humans and monkeys varies systematically (and in parallel) and reflects connections assessed by tracers. Using the template established with control human brains, we found significant differences in short- and long-distance pathways in the brains of individuals with autism. The framework established here helps predict patterns in the architecture and connections of areas across mammalian species and sets the stage to integrate functional imaging data from control subjects to compare with pathological states in humans.
