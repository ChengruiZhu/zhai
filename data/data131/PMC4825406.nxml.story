A massively parallel program for quantum mechanical‐molecular mechanical (QM/MM) molecular dynamics simulation, called Platypus (PLATform for dYnamic Protein Unified Simulation), was developed to elucidate protein functions. The speedup and the parallelization ratio of Platypus in the QM and QM/MM calculations were assessed for a bacteriochlorophyll dimer in the photosynthetic reaction center (DIMER) on the K computer, a massively parallel computer achieving 10 PetaFLOPs with 705,024 cores. Platypus exhibited the increase in speedup up to 20,000 core processors at the HF/cc‐pVDZ and B3LYP/cc‐pVDZ, and up to 10,000 core processors by the CASCI(16,16)/6‐31G** calculations. We also performed excited QM/MM‐MD simulations on the chromophore of Sirius (SIRIUS) in water. Sirius is a pH‐insensitive and photo‐stable ultramarine fluorescent protein. Platypus accelerated on‐the‐fly excited‐state QM/MM‐MD simulations for SIRIUS in water, using over 4000 core processors. In addition, it also succeeded in 50‐ps (200,000‐step) on‐the‐fly excited‐state QM/MM‐MD simulations for the SIRIUS in water. © 2016 The Authors.
