Successful gene mapping strategies for common disease continue to require careful consideration of basic study design with the advent of genome-wide association studies. Here, we take advantage of prior information that the heritability of the quantitative trait myopia in the general population is high and shows evidence of replicated linkage to chromosome 3q26. Based on this, we conducted a fine map linkage disequilibrium association study for the region, using a high-resolution genetic map derived from population-based HapMap Phase II data. For analysis, we used efficient multi-locus tests of association using single nucleotide polymorphism markers genotyped for our sample data and placed on the genetic map measured in linkage disequilibrium units. We followed up preliminary evidence of association for the discovery samples with further genotyping in the same samples to improve the model location estimates for the common functional variants we identified. Three locations were replicated using an independent sample. Two of the identified genes are likely to play an unexpected role in myopia with both pivotal in the healthy housekeeping metabolism of retinal mitochondria. Both proteins interact with OPA1, with nonsynonymous
