Danon disease is a rare, X-linked dominant genetic disorder that is caused by defects in the lysosome-associated membrane protein 2 (LAMP2) gene. It manifests predominantly in young males with a classic triad of cardiomyopathy, skeletal myopathy, and intellectual disability. Death from cardiac disease is the ultimate cause of demise in many patients if left untreated. Given the rarity of the condition, the natural history is poorly understood. Here, we present a case report on a 14-year-old Hispanic boy with Danon disease, highlighting major clinical events and diagnostic study findings over a six-year period from age of symptom onset to age of death. He had significant hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (ventricular septal thickness 65Â mm) and experienced various arrhythmias during his clinical course including Wolf-Parkinson-White syndrome, non-sustained ventricular tachycardia, and pre-excited atrial fibrillation with a fasciculoventricular anomalous accessory pathway. He had sudden cardiac death from ventricular fibrillation at age 14 and his heart had a weight of 1425 grams at autopsy. We also provide a review of the cardiac Danon disease literature related to diagnostic and management approaches to aid cardiologists in evaluating and treating cardiac manifestations in Danon disease patients.
