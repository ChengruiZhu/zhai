Bacteria and archaea are the most primitive forms of life on Earth, invisible to the naked eye and not extremely varied or impressive in their appearance. Nevertheless, they are characterized by an amazing metabolic diversity, especially in the different processes they use to generate energy in the form of ATP. This allows them to persist in diverse and often extreme habitats. Wanting to address how this metabolic diversity evolved, we mapped the distribution of nine bioenergetic modes across all the major lineages of bacteria and archaea. We find a patchy distribution of the different pathways, which suggests either frequent innovations, or gene transfer between unrelated species. We also examined the F-type ATP synthase, a protein complex which is central to all bioenergetic processes, and common to most types of bacteria regardless of how they harness energy from their environment. Our results indicate an ancient origin for this protein complex, and suggest that different species, without necessitating major innovation, used their pre-existing ATP synthase and adapted it to work with different bioenergetic pathways. We also describe gene duplications and rearrangements of the ATP synthase subunits in different lineages, which suggest further flexibility and robustness in the control of ATP synthesis.
