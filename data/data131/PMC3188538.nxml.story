Organisms strike a balance between genetic continuity and change. Most cells are well adapted to their niches and therefore invest heavily in mechanisms that maintain accurate DNA replication. When cell populations are confronted with changing environmental conditions, “mutator” clones with high mutation rates emerge and readily adapt to the new conditions by rapidly acquiring beneficial mutations. However, deleterious mutations also accumulate, raising the question: what level of mutational burden can cell populations sustain before collapsing? Here we experimentally determine the maximal mutation rate in haploid yeast. We observe that yeast can withstand a 1,000-fold increase in mutation rate without losing colony forming capacity. Yet no strains survive a 10,000-fold increase in mutation rate. Escape mutants with an “anti-mutator” phenotype frequently emerge from cell populations undergoing this error-induced extinction. The diversity of antimutator changes suggests that strong mutator phenotypes in nature may be inherently transient, ensuring that rapid adaptation is followed by genetic attenuation which preserves the beneficial, adaptive mutations. These observations are relevant to microbial populations during infection as well as the somatic evolution of cancer cells.
