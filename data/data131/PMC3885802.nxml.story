Extraction and analysis of labile compounds in complex sample matrices, such as plants, is often a big analytical challenge. In this work, the use of a “green and clean” pressurised hot water extraction (PHWE) approach performed in continuous flow mode is explored. Experimental data for extraction and degradation kinetics of selected compounds were utilised to develop a continuous flow extraction (CFE) method targeting thermolabile polyphenols in red onions, with detection by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC)–diode array detection (DAD)–mass spectrometry (MS). Water containing ethanol and formic acid was used as extraction solvent. Method performance was focused on extraction yield with minimal analyte degradation. By adjusting the flow rate of the extraction solvent, degradation effects were minimised, and complete extraction could be achieved within 60 min. The CFE extraction yields of the polyphenols investigated were 80–90 % of the theoretically calculated quantitative yields and were significantly higher than the yields obtained by conventional methanol extraction and static batch extraction (70–79 and 58–67 % of the theoretical yields, respectively). The precision of the developed method was lower than 8 % expressed as relative standard deviation.
