Aim: To investigate the prevalence of the talon cusps in a sample of Indian dental patients and their distribution among different types of teeth. To determine the presence of other dental anomalies associated with the talon cusps.
Method: 2740 out patients (1523 males and 1217 females) attending Oral Medicine department from November 2010 to January 2011 were screened for the presence of talon cusps and were subjected to Intra Oral Peri-apical (IOPA) radiograph to rule out any associated anomalies or peri-apical changes.
Results: Talon cusps were detected in 16 out of 2740 patients (person prevalence 0.58%). Thirty one teeth were found to have talon cusp. Maxillary lateral incisors were the most commonly affected teeth (54.8%, 17 teeth), followed by maxillary central incisors and canines (16.12%, 5 teeth).Talon cusp was found in two mandibular central incisors (6.45%) and one each in mandibular second and third molar (3.22% each). Seventeen teeth in 7 patients (54.83%) were found to be associated with anomalies like dens invagination (6 teeth, 19.35%), impacted 13, 23 (6 teeth, 19.35%), partial anodontia (3 teeth, 9.67%), geographic and fissured tongue (2 teeth, 6.45%). Peri-apical granuloma was found in one tooth with talon cusp associated with dens invaginatus. None of the patients were found to be associated with any syndromes.
Conclusion: Attention should be paid to the presence of the talon cusp and the associated anomalies. Early diagnosis of the talon cusp can help the clinician in preventing the further complications.
