 describe the utility of Epstein-Barr virus serostatus in early NPC detection. While genetic risk factors still remain largely unknown, human leukocyte antigen (HLA) genes have been a focus of attention since the discovery of an HLA association with NPC in 1973 and, two years later, that NPC susceptibility in highest-risk Cantonese involved the co-occurrence of multi-HLA locus combinations of HLA genes as chromosome combinations, or haplotypes (e.g. HLA-A2–B46), whereas in relatively lower-risk non-Cantonese Chinese (Hokkiens, Teochews) they appeared to act independently, a strength of association reflecting the 30–50-fold difference in incidence between highest risk Cantonese and lowest-risk Indians. The prototypic haplotype HLA-A2–B46 extends over megabases. An upstream DNA segment (near HLA-DPA1), has close similarity to Gorilla, with no obvious homology to Chimpanzee in current databases, suggesting that a reticulate model of primate evolution may be more appropriate than simple phylogeny. The DNA variation level in this segment is high enough for it to be a hominin remnant. HLA-B46 arose in mongoloids and remains largely limited to Chinese so the question arises as to whether the hominin candidate segment indicates an eastward trek of
