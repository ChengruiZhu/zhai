The indications for and limitations of extrahepatic bile duct resection (EHBDR) in the context of gallbladder (GB) cancer are unclear. The purpose of this review was to examine the current literature to determine the impact of EHBDR on loco-regional recurrence and survival in GB cancer. The EMBASE and Medline databases were searched up to February 2016 using the terms: extrahepatic bile duct resection and gallbladder cancer. Studies published in the last 20 years were eligible for inclusion. Given the heterogeneity of the population and the study methodologies employed, qualitative data synthesis in the form of meta-analysis was deemed implausible. Twenty-four studies fulfilled the inclusion criteria. The selected studies include 6,722 (55%) EHBDRs in a total of 12,251 GB cancer operations. The 25 studies were categorized into seven groups: 1) cancer survival all stages; 2) hepatoduodenal ligament invasion; 3) outcome in EHBDR and EHBDNR; 4) pT1b tumors; 5) pT2 tumors; 6) pT3/T4 tumors; and 7) incidental GB cancer. Radical cholecystectomy with EHBDR should be used as a standard operation for tumors involving the neck or the cystic duct of the GB (either macroscopically or microscopically). In all other cases, operative strategy should be individualized to the patient.
