During meiosis, two successive chromosomal divisions follow a single S phase, resulting in the formation of four haploid cells, each with half of the parental genetic material. This reduction in chromosome number occurs during the first meiotic division, when homologous chromosomes (paternal and maternal) are separated from each other. For this to happen, homologous chromosomes associate in structures called bivalents, where each chromosome is linked to its homologue by a point of contact known as chiasmata. These chiasmata reflect the formation of crossovers (COs), one of the manifestations of the exchange of genetic material occurring during homologous recombination. CO number varies little at around two per chromosome pair, and they tend to be evenly spaced on chromosomes. Thus, CO number and distribution are very tightly controlled. However, the mechanisms underlying these controls are very poorly understood. In this study, we identified a regulatory pathway of meiotic recombination. We show that this pathway does not regulate the amount of recombination events per se, but instead controls their localisation, as when it is defective, CO events cluster together in a few regions of the genome, leading to bivalent shortage and progeny aneuploidy with incorrect numbers of chromosomes. This regulatory pathway is a posttranslational protein modification system called neddylation (or rubylation in plants), known to be required for numerous cellular processes in eukaryotes. We identify an enzyme of the neddylation complex as a major regulator of meiotic recombination in
