The genome sequence of an organism provides a parts list of proteins, but not an instruction manual for assembling the parts into a cell. Assembly instructions now come from experiments such as two-hybrid screens that detect physical interactions between pairs of proteins. Defining the resources required for generating a full interaction map requires accurate estimates of the false-negative and false-positive rates of genome-scale screens. Two-hybrid screens often select a query protein and sample its interaction partners. True partners may be missed, and false partners may be spuriously identified. This sampling process resembles a capture–recapture experiment, except that classical capture–recapture theory assumes no false positives. Novel extensions to capture–recapture theory permit its application to proteomic screens. This new theory provides statistically grounded answers to long-standing questions: false-discovery rates of high-throughput screens (possibly over 50% per unique interaction, but probably no more than 15% per clone); the quality of different screening libraries; protein properties leading to “sticky” or “promiscuous” interactions; the global network topology; and, most importantly, the coverage of existing two-hybrid maps. Models estimate roughly 30,000 total pairwise interactions in yeast and 500,000 to 1,000,000 in metazoans. The majority of these interactions remain to be discovered.
