Complex action sequences in many animals are organized according to syntactical rules that specify how individual actions are strung together. A critical problem for understanding the neural basis of action sequences is how to derive the syntax that captures the statistics of the sequences. Here we solve this problem for the songs of Bengalese finch, which consist of variable sequences of several stereotypical syllables. The Markov model is widely used for describing variable birdsongs, where each syllable is associated with one state, and the transitions between the states are stochastic and depend only on the state pairs. However, such a model fails to describe the syntax of Bengalese finch songs. We show that two modifications are needed. The first is adaptation. Syllable repetitions are common in the Bengalese finch songs. Allowing the probability of repeating a syllable to decrease with the number of repetitions leads to better fits to the observed repeat number distributions. The second is many-to-one mapping from the states to the syllables. A given syllable can be generated by more than one state. With these modifications, the model successfully describes the statistics of the observed syllable sequences.
