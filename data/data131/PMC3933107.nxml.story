It is likely that neuronal loss occurs in certain brain regions in Alzheimer's Disease (AD) without any neurofibrillary pathology. In the human principle inferior olivary nucleus (PO), we have shown that neuronal loss is about 34% (Lasn et al. Journal of Alzheimer Disease, 2001; 3: 159â€“168), but the fate of the neuroglial cells is unknown. Since the unique network of neurons and neuroglial cells and their cohabitation are essential for normal functioning of CNS, we designed a study to estimate the total number of oligodendrocytes and astrocytes in normally aged and AD brains. The study is based on 10 control and 11 AD post-mortem human brains. An unbiased stereological fractionator method was used. We found significant oligodendroglial cell loss (46%) in AD as compared to control brains, while the total number of astrocytes showed a tendency to decrease. It is likely that the ratio of oligodendroglial cells to neurons remains unchanged even in degenerative states, indicating that oligodendroglial cells parallel neuronal loss. Astroglial cells did not increase in total number, but the ratio to neurons was significantly increased due to the neuronal loss. Using a novel unbiased quantitative method, we were able to describe significant oligodendroglial loss in the PO but the pathogenic mechanism behind remains unknown.
