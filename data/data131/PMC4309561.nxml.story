 gene has a fundamental role in embryo development and is also involved in cancer. The protein is bound to the cell membrane through an anchor, that can be cleaved, causing the secretion of the protein, in a still active form. In the adult, CRIPTO is detected at very low levels in normal tissues and in the blood, while its increase in both tissues and blood is associated to pathological conditions, mainly cancer. As other GPI linked proteins such as the carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), one of the most used tumor markers, CRIPTO is able to reach the bloodstream. Therefore, CRIPTO represents a new promising biomarker and potential therapeutic target, and blood CRIPTO levels might be associated to clinical features. Here we examined the variability of blood CRIPTO levels at a population level (population isolates from the Cilento region in South Italy) and we investigated the genetic architecture underlying this variability. We reported the association of common genetic variants with the levels of CRIPTO protein in the blood and we identified a main locus on chromosome 3 and additional five associated loci. Moreover, through functional analyses, we were able to uncover the mechanism responsible for the variation in CRIPTO levels, which is a regulation mediated by the transcriptional factor AP-1.
