There is growing interest in the possibility that interindividual epigenetic variation plays an important role in a broad range of human diseases. The tissue-specificity of epigenetic regulation, however, will in many cases make it difficult to obtain the appropriate tissues in which to perform large-scale studies linking epigenetic dysregulation to disease. We have used an innovative two-tissue DNA methylation screen to identify genomic regions that exhibit interindividual epigenetic variation which occurs systemically—i.e. similarly in all tissues. Such regions—called metastable epialleles—have previously been identified in mice because they cause visible phenotypic variation amongst genetically identical individuals. Indeed, we found that even monozygotic twins show substantial epigenetic discordance at these loci. Further, we show that, as in mice, establishment of DNA methylation at these putative human metastable epialleles is labile to maternal environment around the time of conception. Metastable epialleles should facilitate an improved understanding both of the role of interindividual epigenetic variation in human disease and of the effects of early environment on the establishment of human epigenotype.
