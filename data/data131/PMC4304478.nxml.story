 integrins have
generated great interest
because of the role of these receptors in mediating angiogenesis and
metastasis. Attempts to increase the binding affinity and hence the
efficacy of integrin inhibitors by dimerization have been marginally
effective. In the present work, we achieved this goal by using oxime-based
chemical conjugation to synthesize dimers of integrin-binding cystine
knot (knottin) miniproteins with low-picomolar binding affinity to
tumor cells. A non-natural amino acid containing an aminooxy side
chain was introduced at different locations within a knottin monomer
and reacted with dialdehyde-containing cross-linkers of different
lengths to create knottin dimers with varying molecular topologies.
Dimers cross-linked through an aminooxy functional group located near
the middle of the protein exhibited higher apparent binding affinity
to integrin-expressing tumor cells compared with dimers cross-linked
through an aminooxy group near the C-terminus. In contrast, the cross-linker
length had no effect on the integrin binding affinity. A chemical-based
dimerization strategy was critical, as knottin dimers created through
genetic fusion to a bivalent antibody domain exhibited only modest
improvement (less than 5-fold) in tumor cell binding relative to the
knottin monomer. The best oxime-conjugated knottin dimer achieved
an unprecedented 150-fold increase in apparent binding affinity over
the knottin monomer. Also, this dimer bound 3650-fold stronger and
inhibited tumor cell migration and proliferation compared with cilengitide,
an integrin-targeting peptidomimetic that performed poorly in recent
clinical trials, suggesting promise for further therapeutic development.
