76 patients played a sport preoperatively and met inclusion/exclusion criteria. The average follow-up was 31.6 months (12-65 mons) and average age was 74.84 years (49.9 - 92.6 yrs). Preoperative diagnoses were cuff tear arthropathy (55.2%), osteoarthritis (30.9%), proximal humerus fracture (17.1%), and rheumatoid arthritis (5.2%). 73% of the cohort had undergone prior ipsilateral shoulder surgery. Average VAS pain scores improved from 6.57 to 0.63 (p<0.001). Average ASES scores improved from 34.30 to 81.45 (p<0.001). 85.5% of patients who participated in sports preoperatively returned to at least one sport following RTSA. Average time to full return to sport was 5.3 months. Walking had the highest direct rate of return (85.7%), followed by fitness sports (81.5%), swimming (66.7%), running (57.1%), cycling (50.0%) and golf (50%). Age less than 70 years had significant improvement in rate of return to sports (p<0.002). 41.1% reported improved physical fitness following RTSA. 88.2% felt their sports outcome was good to excellent and 93.4% felt their surgical outcome was good to excellent. The two most commonly reported reasons for not returning to a sport were pain (13.1%) and lack of interest (9.2%). For all types of sports and rates of return see fig 1.
