 sets of co-expressed genes orchestrating important physiological or pathological processes. However, these compendia present particular challenges, including cellular inhomogeneity within samples, genetic and environmental variation across samples, uncertainty in the numbers of programs and sample populations, and temporal behavior. To address these challenges, we developed GeneProgram, a state-of-the-art statistical framework that automatically generates interpretable maps of expression programs from microarray data. GeneProgram accomplishes this by simultaneously organizing tissues into groups and genes into overlapping programs with consistent temporal behavior, and sorting programs by a generality score. Such maps may be valuable for guiding future biological experiments; genes from programs with low generality scores might serve as new drug targets that exhibit minimal “cross-talk,” and genes from high generality programs may maintain common physiological responses that go awry in disease states. Using synthetic and real data, we showed that GeneProgram outperformed several popular expression analysis methods. Further, on a compendium of time-series gene expression data measuring the responses of human cells to infectious agents, GeneProgram discovered programs that implicate surprising signaling pathways and receptor types.
