The v-Crk avian sarcoma virus CT10 oncogene homolog-like (CRKL) protein is important in cancer progression. However, its expression pattern and biological roles in human endometrial carcinoma remain unexplored. The potential mechanism of CRKL-induced cancer progression is still unclear. The present study aimed to explore the expression pattern and biological roles of CRKL in human endometrial carcinoma. Using immunohistochemistry, it was observed that the CRKL protein was overexpressed in 50.5% (44/87) of endometrial carcinoma tissues. Plasmid transfection of CRKL into Ishikawa cells was performed, and CRKL overexpression promoted cell proliferation, colony formation and cell cycle transition in the transfected cells. In addition, CRKL overexpression inhibited cell apoptosis in Ishikawa cells treated with cisplatin, with decreased caspase-3 and caspase-9 cleavage. Further analysis revealed that CRKL upregulated the expression of cyclin D1, cyclin E, B cell lymphoma (Bcl)-2 and survivin, and downregulated Bcl-2 associated X protein expression. In conclusion, the present study demonstrated that CRKL overexpression in endometrial carcinoma contributes to malignant cell growth and resistance to apoptosis, possibly through Bcl-2.
