All hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) are characterized by the capacities to produce all blood cell-types by differentiation and to maintain their own population through self-renewal divisions. Every individual HSC, therefore, can generate a complete blood system, or clone, conveying oxygenation and immune protection for a limited time. The time for which all mature blood cell-types can be found in a clone is called the lifespan. Interestingly, HSCs with different lifespans co-exist in the same host. We address the unresolved question: what controls the lifespan of HSCs of the same genotype exposed to the same environment? Here, we use a new approach to multi-scale modeling based on reliability theory and non-linear dynamics to address this question. Large-scale fluctuations in the experimental failure rate kinetics of HSC clones are identified to predict small-scale, genome level, events of deep penetrance, or magnitudes that approach population size. We broadly find that one condition explains our experimental data: repair mechanisms are a priori imperfect and do not improve, nor deteriorate, during the lifespan. As a result, progressively “worse-than-old” genome replicates are generated in self-renewal. A likely interpretation of our findings is that the lifespan of adult HSCs is determined by epigenetically pre-programmed differences in repair capacity.
