Twenty (10 matched pairs) of fresh frozen full length humeri (mean age 55.3 years, range 37-70 years) were used to perform this study. All humeral specimens were stripped of all soft tissue, except for the pectoralis major tendon, which was used to determine location of the tenodesis. Specimens were allocated to either Screw (n=5) or Empty Ream Group (n=5) and the matching contralateral pairs remained intact. In the Empty Ream specimens, an 8 mm unicortical hole was placed into the bicipital groove 1 cm proximal to the inferior border of the pectoralis major tendon. The humeri in the Screw Group were prepared in the same manner and filled with a 8mm x 12 mm polyetheretherketone (PEEK) screw. All specimens were tested until failure under torsional loading at a rate of 1 degree/second. Peak torque, angular deformation at peak, and total energy to failure were recorded. A paired t-test was used to compare data from left and right humeri for each of the two groups. Data were also evaluated as the ratio of the intervention humerus to its contralateral intact humerus in order to compare Tenodesis Screw and Empty Ream groups via a 2-tailed, unpaired t-test. Statistical significance was assumed for P <0.05.
