Since the early days of the kala-azar elimination programme in the Indian subcontinent, TDR has engaged with national control and research institutions to conduct research aimed at informing country policy and practice to identify and treat cases and to prevent transmission of the infection. This includes the evaluation of the rK39 rapid diagnostic test for the diagnosis of VL, the clinical development and evaluation of first-line treatments (miltefosine and liposomal amphotericin B), the generation of evidence-based tools for early detection and complete clinical management of VL, the evaluation of the cost effectiveness of indoor residual spraying, insecticide-treated bed nets, insecticide-impregnated durable wall linings, and environmental vector management as tools for integrated vector management. The interaction and interdependence between implementation research, technical advice, partnership, and policy is yet another example of TDRâ€™s stewardship contribution and empowerment toward VL elimination in the Indian subcontinent. Continuing investment in translational research from the bench to the bedside to public health, established jointly by national control programmes, academics, and TDR coordinators, is imperative to block transmission and prevent a resurgence of VL in the future.
