Premature senescence is a key process in the progression of diabetic nephropathy (DN). Premature senescence of renal tubular epithelial cells (RTEC) in DN may result from the accumulation of damaged mitochondria. Mitophagy is the principal process that eliminates damaged mitochondria through PTEN-induced putative kinase 1 (PINK1)-mediated recruitment of optineurin (OPTN) to mitochondria. We aimed to examine the involvement of OPTN in mitophagy regulation of cellular senescence in RTEC in the context of DN. In vitro, the expression of senescence markers P16, P21, DcR2, SA-β-gal, SAHF, and insufficient mitophagic degradation marker (mitochondrial P62) in mouse RTECs increased after culture in 30 mM high-glucose (HG) conditions for 48 h. Mitochondrial fission/mitophagy inhibitor Mdivi-1 significantly enhanced RTEC senescence under HG conditions, whereas autophagy/mitophagy agonist Torin1 inhibited cell senescence. MitoTempo inhibited HG-induced mitochondrial reactive oxygen species and cell senescence with or without Mdivi-1. The expression of PINK1 and OPTN, two regulatory factors for mitophagosome formation, decreased significantly after HG stimulation. Overexpression of PINK1 did not enhance mitophagosome formation under HG conditions. OPTN silencing significantly inhibited HG-induced mitophagosome formation, and overexpression of OPTN relieved cellular senescence through promoting mitophagy. In clinical specimens, renal OPTN expression was gradually decreased with increased tubulointerstitial injury scores. OPTN-positive renal tubular cells did not express senescence marker P16. OPTN expression also negatively correlated with serum creatinine levels, and positively correlated with eGFR. Thus, OPTN-mediated mitophagy plays a crucial regulatory role in HG-induced RTEC senescence in DN. OPTN may, therefore, be a potential antisenescence factor in DN.
