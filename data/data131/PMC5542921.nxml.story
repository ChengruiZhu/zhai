The popularity of ceramic restorations can be attributed to its life-like appearance, durability and biocompatibility and therefore ceramic restorations have been widely used for anterior and posterior teeth. Ceramic restorations have esthetic and biocompatible advantages but low fracture resistance. Since it has high flexural strength and fracture resistance, yttria-stabilized tetragonal zirconia polycrystal (Y-TZP) is the dental material most commonly used for the core of ceramic crowns and fixed dental prosthesis. In spite of improved mechanical properties, acceptable marginal adaptation and biocompatibility the whitish opacity of zirconia is an obvious esthetic disadvantage. The zirconia framework is often veneered with conventional feldspathic porcelain to achieve a natural appearance. However it is difficult to achieve sufficient bond strength between zirconia and the veneering material. Achieving sufficient bond strength between the veneering ceramic and the zirconia core is a major challenge in the long term clinical success of veneered zirconia restorations. The main objective of this study is to evaluate the effect of different surface treatments on the fracture strength of the two commercially available Zirconia namely Ceramill and ZR-White (AMANNGIRRBACH and UPCERA) respectively.
