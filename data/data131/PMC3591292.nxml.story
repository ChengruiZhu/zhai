The “missing heritability” problem has been intensely debated for the last few years. Possible explanations include the existence of many genetic variants each with a small effect, rare variants with large effects, and heritability being over-estimated. Previous studies using whole-genome estimation have demonstrated that for human complex traits such as height, body mass index, and intelligence, a large portion of the heritability can be captured by all the common SNPs on the current genotyping arrays. These studies, however, were all concentrated only on a few traits. In this study, we analysed 49 quantitative traits in a sample of ∼7,000 unrelated Korean individuals. We found that, on average over all the traits, common SNPs on the Affymetrix 5.0 genotyping array explain approximately a third of the heritability, that genetic variants are widely distributed across the whole genome with longer chromosomes explaining more phenotypic variation, and that approximately any 1% of the genome explains 1% of the heritability. Despite examples where a few variants explain a substantial amount of variation, all these results are consistent with polygenicity being ubiquitous for most complex traits.
