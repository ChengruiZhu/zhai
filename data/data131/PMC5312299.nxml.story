Comparing a single-strand DNA library preparation method originally developed for ancient DNA to conventional protocols using double-stranded DNA derived from FFPE material we obtain on average 900-fold more library molecules and improved sequence complexity from as little as 5 ng input DNA. FFPE DNA is highly fragmented, usually below 100bp, and up to 60% of reads start after or end prior to adenine residues, suggesting that crosslinks predominate at adenine residues. Similar to ancient DNA, C > T substitutions are slightly increased with maximum rates up to 3% at the ends of molecules. In whole exome sequencing of single-strand libraries from lung, breast, colorectal, prostate and skin cancers we identify known cancer mutations. In summary, we show that single-strand library preparation enables genomic sequencing, even from low amounts of degraded FFPE DNA. This method provides a clear advantage both in research and clinical settings, where FFPE material (e.g. from biopsies) often is the only source of DNA available. Improving the genetic characterization that can be performed on conventional archived FFPE tissue, the single-strand library preparation allows scarce samples to be used in personalized medicine and enables larger sample sizes in future sequencing studies.
