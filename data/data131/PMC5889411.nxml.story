Pulmonary hypertension (PH) is a disease with severe morbidity and mortality. Echocardiography plays an essential role in the screening of PH. The quality of the acquired continuous wave Doppler signal is the major limitation of the method and can greatly affect the accuracy of estimated pulmonary pressures. The aim of this study was to evaluate the clinical need to image from multiple ultrasound windows in patients with suspected pulmonary hypertension. We prospectively evaluated 65 patients (43% male, mean age 67.2 years) with echocardiography and right heart catheterization. 17% had invasively normal pulmonary pressures, 83% had pulmonary hypertension. Peak tricuspid regurgitation (TR) velocity was imaged in five echocardiographic views. Sufficient Doppler signal was recorded in 94% of the patients. Correlation for overall peak TR velocity with invasively measured systolic pulmonary artery pressure was r = 0.83 (p < 0.001). Considering all five imaging windows resulted in a sensitivity of 87%, and a specificity of 91% for correct diagnosis of PH with an AUC of 0.89, which was significantly better as compared to sole imaging from the right ventricular modified apical four-chamber view (AUC 0.85, p = 0.0395). Additional imaging from atypical views changed the overall peak TR velocity in 32% of the patients. A multiple-view approach changed the echocardiographic diagnosis of PH in 11% of the patients as opposed to sole imaging from an apical four-chamber view. This study comprehensively assessed the impact on clinical decision making when evaluating patients with an echocardiographic multiplane approach for suspected PH. This approach substantially increased sensitivity without a decrease in specificity.
