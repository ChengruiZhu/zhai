Epigenetics is the study of heritable phenotypic variations that are not caused by changes in the genotype. Silent Information Regulator (SIR) silencing in budding yeast is an important model system for epigenetics. The standard model of silencing relies on feedback, mediated by chromatin modifications (for example, deacetylation of histone residues) which lead to enhanced recruitment of chromatin modifiers. However, the SIR mechanism is not completely understood and it is important to investigate whether as-yet-undiscovered components alter the systems design in a fundamental way. We address this question using minimal models constructed from experimentally known interactions. Rather than building a detailed network model with parameters to fit for quantitative predictions, we build an effective model and study its bifurcation diagram which leads to robust qualitative predictions on the nature of mutants. This minimal modeling delineates a phase space with qualitatively different epigenetic mechanisms and states; some of which arise from drug/genetic perturbations and exhibit large cell-to-cell variation in chromatin marks. Our methodology can be applied to the study of epigenetic chromatin silencing in other model systems, especially Polycomb silencing, and reveals engineering principles that may be of broad relevance.
