Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) molecules are of central importance in cellular communication. Embedded in the cell membrane, these receptors bind epidermal growth factor (EGF) molecules outside the cell and translate this binding into specific biochemical signals inside the cell, which in turn trigger cell proliferation, migration, or differentiation. EGFR dysfunction has been implicated in a variety of cancers, and EGFR-targeting drugs are commonly used in cancer treatments. It has been widely assumed that the extracellular portion of an EGFR molecule protrudes perpendicularly from the cell membrane. In detailed, atomic-level computer simulations, however, we find that it lies down on the membrane, placing its EGF-binding site adjacent to the membrane surface. We further show that EGF may interact with EGFR in two distinct ways (with or without the involvement of the membrane). This may explain the experimental finding that an EGF molecule binds to EGFR more weakly at higher EGF concentration. This phenomenon, which is a manifestation of an underlying negative cooperativity, is an important but poorly understood characteristic of EGFR activity. In this study, we also model and analyze the glycan chains attached to EGFR, which are integral to its behavior in living cells.
