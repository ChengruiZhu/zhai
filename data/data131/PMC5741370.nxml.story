Tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα)-based immunotherapy is the vital host defense system against the progression of gastric cancer (GC) as a pro-inflammatory and pro-apoptotic cytokine. However, resistance limits its therapeutic efficiency. Therefore, an increasing number of studies are focusing on the development of drugs or methods with which to enhance the treatment efficacy of TNFα. Nuclear receptor subfamily 4 group A member 1 (NR4A1) has been shown to exert antitumor effects through several mechanisms, such as by inhibiting proliferation, as well as pro-apoptotic and potent pro-oxidant effects. In this study, we examined the effects and mechanisms of action of NR4A1 on the apoptosis of GC cells treated with TNFα, with particular focus on mitochondrial homeostasis. We found that TNFα treatment decreased NR4A1 expression. Moreover, the overexpression of NR4A1 in the presence of TNFα further increased GC cell apoptosis. Mechanistically, the overexpression of NR4A1 augmented caspase-9-dependent mitochondrial apoptosis, as evidenced by reduced mitochondrial membrane potential, reactive oxygen species (ROS) overproduction, mitochondrial permeability transition pore (mPTP) opening and the leakage of cytochrome
