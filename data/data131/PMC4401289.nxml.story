Mouse embryonic endothelial progenitor cells (eEPCs) acquire a mature phenotype after treatment with cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP), suggesting an involvement of Raf serine/threonine kinases in the differentiation process. To test this idea, we investigated the role of B-Raf and C-Raf in proliferation and differentiation of eEPCs by expressing fusion proteins consisting of the kinase domains from Raf molecules and the hormone binding site of the estrogen receptor (ER), or its variant, the tamoxifen receptor. Our findings show that both B- and C-Raf kinase domains, when lacking adjacent regulatory parts, are equally effective in inducing eEPC differentiation. In contrast, the C-Raf kinase domain is a more potent stimulator of eEPC proliferation than B-Raf. In a complimentary approach, we used siRNA silencing to knockdown endogenously expressed B-Raf and C-Raf in eEPCs. In this experimental setting, we found that eEPCs lacking B-Raf failed to differentiate, whereas loss-of C-Raf function primarily slowed cell growth without impairing cAMP-induced differentiation. These findings were further corroborated in B-Raf null eEPCs, isolated from the corresponding knockout embryos, which failed to differentiate
