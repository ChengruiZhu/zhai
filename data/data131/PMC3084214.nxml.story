Determining which of two related viruses will spread from human to human more efficiently – e. g. an influenza virus that is treatable with drugs and one that is resistant to them – is important when forecasting the potential impact of an emergent novel virus or developing public health intervention strategies. However, making such measurements of relative transmissibility directly through observation, even using an animal model, is difficult. We have recently developed and published an experimental technique in which an animal is infected with both viruses of interest at once, and then allowed to mix with other animals and so transmit the infection. These experiments provide the necessary data for analysis using the novel mathematical framework that we introduce here. Our mathematical and computational results exploit the power of the experimental system, and allow us to make a quantitative estimate of the relative transmissibility of a drug-resistant influenza virus compared to its drug-sensitive counterpart. Through computer simulation, we demonstrate the wider application of our mathematical technique, and suggest design criteria for future experiments designed to measure the transmissibility of one virus (or other type of pathogen) compared to another.
