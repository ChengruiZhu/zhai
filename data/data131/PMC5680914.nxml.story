Because membrane type 1-matrix metalloproteinase 1 (MT1-MMP) and erythropoietin-producing hepatocellular receptor 2 (EphA2) expression are upregulated by the Ras/mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway, they are frequently coexpressed in malignant tumors. MT1-MMP cleaves the N-terminal ligand-binding domain of EphA2 and inactivates its ligand-dependent tumor-suppressing activity. Therefore, specific detection of the cleaved N-terminal EphA2 fragment in blood might be an effective biomarker to diagnose malignant tumors. To evaluate this possibility, we developed three monoclonal antibodies against the soluble EphA2 fragment. One of them recognized this fragment specifically, with negligible cross-reactivity to the intact form. We used the cleaved form-specific antibody to develop a quantitative enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and confirmed the linear reactivity to the recombinant fragment. We applied this assay on commercially available serum specimens obtained from patients with several types of cancer including gastric, pancreatic, esophageal, gastroesophageal, and head-and-neck cancers, and healthy donors. Soluble EphA2 fragment levels in cancer-patient sera were higher than those in healthy donors (
