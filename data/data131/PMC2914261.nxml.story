 across the membrane, yet the 3D nanomechanics of the skeletal network remains poorly understood. Expanding from our previous single isolated unit, we now simulate networks consisting of 1–10 concentric rings of repeating units in equibiaxial deformation. The networks are organized with (1) a 3D model for a single unit, (2) a wrap-around mode between Sp and actin protofilament in the intra-unit interaction, and (3) a random inter-unit connectivity. These assumptions permit efficient five-degrees-of-freedom (5DOF) simulations when up to 30 pN of radial forces are applied to the boundary spectrin (Sp) and the center and other units are analyzed. As 6 Sp balance their tensions, hexagonal units become irregular. While actin protofilaments remain tangent to the network, their yaw (Φ) angles change drastically with addition of neighboring units or an Sp unfolding. It is anticipated that during deformation, transmembrane complexes associated with the network move laterally through the lipid bilayer and increase the diffusion of molecules across the membrane. When protofilament/Sp sweeps under the lipid bilayer, they mix up the submembrane concentration gradient. Thus, the nanomechanics of actin protofilaments and Sp may enhance the transport of molecules during erythrocyte deformation.
