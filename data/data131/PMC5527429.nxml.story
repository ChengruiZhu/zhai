 isolates, and 5 miscellaneous bacteria. The genome coverage range was 15.71× to 216.4× (average, 79.72×; median, 71.55×); the limit of detection (LOD) for single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) was 60×. The accuracy, reproducibility, and repeatability of base calling were >99.9%. The accuracy of phylogenetic analysis was 100%. The specificity and sensitivity inferred from multilocus sequence typing (MLST) and genome-wide SNP-based phylogenetic assays were 100%. The following objectives were accomplished: (i) the establishment of the performance specifications for WGS applications in PHLs according to CLIA guidelines, (ii) the development of quality assurance and quality control measures, (iii) the development of a reporting format for end users with or without WGS expertise, (iv) the availability of a validation set of microorganisms, and (v) the creation of a modular template for the validation of WGS processes in PHLs. The validation panel, sequencing analytics, and raw sequences could facilitate multilaboratory comparisons of WGS data. Additionally, the WGS performance specifications and modular template are adaptable for the validation of other platforms and reagent kits.
