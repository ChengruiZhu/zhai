Under appropriate conditions, the interaction of the plant alkaloid ryanodine with a single cardiac sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca(2+)-release channel results in a profound modification of both channel gating and conduction. On modification, the channel undergoes a dramatic increase in open probability and a change in single-channel conductance. In this paper we aim to provide a mechanistic framework for the interpretation of the altered conductance seen after ryanodine binding to the channel protein. To do this we have characterized single-channel conductance with representative members of three classes of permeant cation; group 1a monovalent cations, alkaline earth divalent cations, and organic monovalent cations. We have quantified the change in single-channel conductance induced by ryanodine and have expressed this as a fraction of conductance in the absence of ryanodine. Fractional conductance seen in symmetrical 210 mM solutions is not fixed but varies with the nature of the permeant cation. The group 1a monovalent cations (K+, Na+, Cs+, Li+) have values of fractional conductance in a narrow range (0.60- 0.66). With divalent cations fractional conductance is considerably lower (Ba2+, 0.22 and Sr2+, 0.28), whereas values of fractional conductance vary considerably with the organic monovalent cations (ammonia 0.66, ethylamine 0.76, propanolamine 0.65, diethanolamine 0.92, diethylamine 1.2). To establish the mechanisms governing these differences, we have monitored the affinity of the conduction pathway for, and the relative permeability of, representative cations in the ryanodine-modified channel. These parameters have been compared with those obtained in previous studies from this laboratory using the channel in the absence of ryanodine and have been modeled by modifying our existing single-ion, four-barrier three-well rate theory model of conduction in the unmodified channel. Our findings indicate that the high affinity, essentially irreversible, interaction of ryanodine with the cardiac sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca(2+)-release channel produces a conformational alteration of the protein which results in modified ion handling. We suggest that, on modification, the affinity of the channel for the group 1a monovalent cations is increased while the relative permeability of this class of cations remains essentially unaltered. The affinity of the conduction pathway for the alkaline earth divalent cations is also increased, however the relative permeability of this class of cations is reduced compared to the unmodified channel. The influence of modification on the handling by the channel of the organic monovalent cations is determined by both the size and the nature of the cation.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)
