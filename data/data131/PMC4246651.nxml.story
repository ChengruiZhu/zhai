Central neurocytoma is a relatively rare tumor of the central nervous system. Young adults are most commonly affected, with a similar incidence in males and females. The tumor is predominantly occurs in the ventricular system of the brain. The tumor is benign and exhibits a good response to surgical resection and radiation therapy. The typical central neurocytoma occurs in the supratentorial ventricular system in young adults. Extraventricular neurocytomas are rare in the spinal cord. In the present study, two cases of craniocervical neurocytomas and the clinical presentation, magnetic resonance imaging observations, pathological features and two-year follow-up results are reported. The first case presents a 26 year old male with an intramedullary mass extending from the medualla oblongata to the T4 segement of the spine. The second case presents the case of a 48 year old female with an intramedullary mass extending from the oblongata to the T2 segement of the spine. The two patients underwent subtotal resection of the masses and post-operative radiotherapy was administered for three months. Post-operative magentic resoance imaging revealed no tumor recurrence in the two cases, two years after resection. The relevant literature is also discussed.
