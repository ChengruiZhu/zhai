 (SEAC) on airway inflammation and remodeling in an ovalbumin (OVA)-induced asthma model. To accomplish this, alterations of the nitric oxide (NO) level, inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) expression levels, as well as variations in immune cell numbers, immunoglobulin E (IgE) concentration, histopathological structure and inflammatory cytokine levels were measured in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-activated RAW264.7 cells or an OVA-induced mouse model of asthma treated with SEAC. The concentration of NO and mRNA levels of COX-2 and iNOS were significantly decreased in the SEAC + LPS-treated RAW264.7 cells compared with the vehicle + LPS-treated RAW264.7 cells. Additionally, in the OVA-induced asthma model, the number of immune cells in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, the concentration of OVA-specific IgE, the infiltration of inflammatory cells, the bronchial thickness and the levels of the inflammatory mediators interleukin-4 (IL-4), IL-13 and COX-2 were significantly lower in the OVA + SEAC-treated group compared with the OVA + vehicle-treated group. In addition, a significant reduction in goblet cell hyperplasia, peribronchiolar collagen layer thickness and VEGF expression for airway remodeling was detected in the OVA + SEAC-treated group compared with the OVA + vehicle-treated group. These findings indicate that SEAC is a suppressor of airway inflammation and remodeling, and may therefore be useful as an anti-inflammatory drug for the treatment of asthma.
