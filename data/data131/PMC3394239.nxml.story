An important tool to study rhythmic neuronal synchronization is provided by relating spiking activity to the Local Field Potential (LFP). Two types of interdependent spike-LFP measures exist. The first approach is to directly quantify the consistency of single spike-LFP phases across spikes, referred to here as point-field phase synchronization measures. We show that conventional point-field phase synchronization measures are sensitive not only to the consistency of spike-LFP phases, but are also affected by statistical dependencies between spike-LFP phases, caused by e.g. non-Poissonian history-effects within spike trains such as bursting and refractoriness. To solve this problem, we develop a new pairwise measure that is not biased by the number of spikes and not affected by statistical dependencies between spike-LFP phases. The second approach is to quantify, similar to EEG-EEG coherence, the consistency of the relative phase between spike train and LFP signals across trials instead of across spikes, referred to here as spike train to field phase synchronization measures. We demonstrate an analytical relationship between point-field and spike train to field phase synchronization measures. Based on this relationship, we prove that the spike train to field pairwise phase consistency (PPC), a quantity closely related to the squared spike-field coherence, is a monotonically increasing function of the number of spikes per trial. This derived relationship is exact and analytic, and takes a linear form for weak phase-coupling. To solve this problem, we introduce a corrected version of the spike train to field PPC that is independent of the number of spikes per trial. Finally, we address the problem that dependencies between spike-LFP phase and the number of spikes per trial can cause spike-LFP phase synchronization measures to be biased by the number of trials. We show how to modify the developed point-field and spike train to field phase synchronization measures in order to make them unbiased by the number of trials.
