 were studied with the electron microscope. The outer layer of the nuclear envelope is actively engaged in the formation of vesicular elements along most of its surface, especially in smaller oocytes. Groups of vesicles appear to be released into the ooplasm at about the same time, resulting in long chains of individual vesicles immediately adjacent to the nuclear membrane. This process is repeated so that chains of vesicles grouped in rather ordered ranks extend progressively into the surrounding cytoplasm. Eventually, the cytoplasm becomes more concentrated with chains of vesicles and the distance between the individual rows becomes less. Very soon after a chain of vesicles has been budded off from the nuclear membrane, fine intervesicular connections appear between certain of the vesicles comprising the rows. Several of the vesicles in a row may then fuse, forming short, flattened cisternae. Fusion of vesicles continues, individual rows of vesicles become more closely packed and, finally, regions appear in the cytoplasm which have the appearance of annulate lamellae. Further growth of the lamellae appears to occur by the progressive fusion of vesicles at the ends of those lamellae already present, as well as by the addition of other fusing rows of vesicles.
