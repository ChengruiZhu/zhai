 fertilization (IVF). Previous studies have suggested that dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) may improve IVF outcomes in PORs. The current study attempted to investigate the clinical benefits of DHEA in PORs and the possible mechanisms of DHEA on cumulus cells (CCs). This was a prospective study performed at one tertiary center from January 2015 to March 2016. A total of 131 women who underwent IVF treatment participated, including 59 normal ovarian responders (NORs) and 72 PORs. PORs were assigned to receive DHEA supplementation or not before the IVF cycle. For all patients, CCs were obtained after oocyte retrieval. In the CCs, mRNA expression of apoptosis-related genes and mitochondrial transcription factor A (TFAM) gene, terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling assay, mitochondrial dehydrogenase activity and mitochondrial mass were measured. The results indicated that PORs with DHEA supplementation produces a great number of top-quality embryos at day 3 and increased the number of transferred embryos and fertilization rate compared with those without DHEA supplementation. Additionally, supplementation with DHEA in PORs decreased DNA damage and apoptosis in CCs while enhancing the mitochondrial mass, mitochondrial dehydrogenase activity and TFAM expression in CCs. In conclusion, our results showed that the benefits of DHEA supplementation on IVF outcomes in PORs were significant, and the effects may be partially mediated by improving mitochondrial function and reducing apoptosis in CCs.
