The lung is the most common extra-abdominal site of metastasis in colorectal cancer (CRC), in which circular RNA (circRNA) may have a crucial role. Therefore, the present study detected circRNA expression to identify novel targets to further study lung metastasis in CRC. In the present study, total RNA was extracted from CRC tissues of patients with and without lung metastasis to perform high-throughput microarray assay in order to detect differentially expressed circRNA. Following this, gene ontology (GO) and pathway analyses of the genes producing differentially expressed circRNA were performed to predict the function of circRNA using standard enrichment computational methods. Additionally, the circRNA/microRNA (miRNA) interactions were constructed with bioinformatics methods to predict the binding of miRNA with circRNA. In the CRC tissues from patients with lung metastasis, 431 circRNA were detected to be differentially expressed, including 192 upregulated and 239 downregulated over 2-fold compared with the CRC tissues without metastasis. Furthermore, GO analysis revealed that the genes producing upregulated circRNA were involved in DNA repair, while the genes producing downregulated circRNA were enriched in signal transduction. By pathway analysis, it was identified that the genes producing downregulated circRNA were involved in the nuclear factor-ÎºB and Wnt signaling pathway in the CRC tissues from patients with lung metastasis compared with the CRC tissues without metastasis. In addition, it was demonstrated that hsa_circRNA_105055, hsa_circRNA_086376 and hsa_circRNA_102761 could commonly bind with miR-7 regulating target genes PRKCB, EPHA3, BRCA1 and ABCC1. The findings of the present study may provide a novel perspective on circRNA and lay a foundation for future research of potential roles of circRNA in CRC with lung metastasis.
