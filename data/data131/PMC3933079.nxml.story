Background: Smad2 and Smad3 are transcription factors that mediate transforming growth factor beta (TGF-β) signals. Upon their activation, phosphorylated Smad2/Smad3 (pSmad2/Smad3), translocate to the nucleus and associate with co-activators such as p300, regulating the transcription of genes that contribute to the fibrotic processes. Methods: We investigated the immunohistochemical expression of pSmad2/Smad3 and the co-activator p300 in 152 renal biopsy specimens from patients with various types of glomerulonephritides (GNs) and in 15 normal kidney specimens. Patients’ clinical data (serum creatinine level and proteinuria) had been collected. Results: There was a dramatic increase in the expression of pSmad2/3 and p300 in all glomerular cell types in all GNs. pSmad2/3 expression was increased in all tubular segments (except for the proximal tubules in nonproliferative GNs), while p300 expression was significantly increased only in the proximal tubular cells in all GNs. Glomerular and tubular pSmad2/Smad3 and p300 were significantly increased in proliferative GNs (compared to the nonproliferative), particularly in the secondary group. The expression profile of p300 correlated positively with the expression of pSmad2/Smad3 in the diseased glomeruli and proximal tubules. pSmad2/3 and p300 were very often detected in segmental hyperplastic lesions, cellular crescents, microadhesions and segmental or global sclerotic areas. Glomerular and proximal tubular pSmad2/Smad3 was positively correlated with serum creatinine levels, while distal and collecting tubular pSmad2/3 and p300 correlated positively with tubular atrophy. Glomerular and proximal tubular pSmad2/3 expression and glomerular p300 expression correlated positively with lupus nephritis activity. Conclusion: Our results suggest that pSmad2/3-p300 pathway may play a pivotal role in the pathogenesis and progression of human glomerulonephritis.
