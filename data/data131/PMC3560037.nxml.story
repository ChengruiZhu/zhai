An ideal oral drug carrier should facilitate drug delivery to the gastrointestinal tract and its absorption into the systemic circulation. To meet these requirements, we developed a thiomer-coated liposomal delivery system composed of 1,2-dipalmitoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DPPC) and a maleimide-functionalized lipid, to which chitosan-thioglycolic acid (CS-TGA) was covalently coupled. In addition to conventional 77 kDa CS-TGA (CS-TGA77), we tested the 150 kDa homologue (CS-TGA150) as well as an S-protected version of this polymer (CS-TGA150-MNA), in which some of the free SH-groups are conjugated with 6-mercaptonicotinamide to protect them from oxidation. Coupling of CS-TGA to the liposomal surface led to an increase in the particle size of at least 150 nm and an increase in the zeta potential from approximately − 33 mV to a maximum of about + 36 mV, depending on the polymer. As revealed by fluorescence dequenching the formulations have a storage stability of at least two weeks without releasing any encapsulated compounds. In simulated gastric fluid, the system was shown to be stable over 24 h, while in simulated intestinal fluid, a slow, sustained release of encapsulated compounds was observed. According to our experiments, thiomer-coated liposomes did not induce immunogenic reactions after an oral administration to mice. To evaluate the permeation enhancing and efflux pump inhibiting properties of CS-TGA coated liposomes we monitored the transport of fluoresceinisothiocyanate-dextran (FD
