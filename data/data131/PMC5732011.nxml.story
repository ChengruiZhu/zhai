It is well recognized that patients can develop additional vertebral compression fractures (VCF) in an adjacent vertebra or at another vertebral level after successful vertebral augmentation. Factors such as the patient's bone mineral density, post procedure activity, and chronic corticosteroid use contribute to an increased risk of re-fracture or development of new fractures in the first three months after the initial procedure. However, there is a very small subgroup of patients that have unchanged or worse pain after the vertebral augmentation that may indicate continued progression of the treated compression fracture or a recurrent fracture at the previously treated level. This review examines the clinical findings, radiologic signs, and intraprocedural technical failures that may occur during the initial vertebral augmentation that can lead to a progressive fracture in a previously treated vertebra. Causes of failure of the initial vertebral augmentation procedure include inadequate or incomplete filling of the fracture site, the cement missing the actual fracture allowing continued osteoporotic compression, and persistent or worsened intravertebral fluid-filled clefts. The existence of an unfilled intravertebral fluid cleft on preoperative diagnostic studies is the most important indicator of risk for progression as is the later development of fluid at the bone cement interface.
