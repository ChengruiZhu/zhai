There is a high prevalence of chronic hyponatremia in the elderly, frequently owing to the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion (SIADH). Recent reports have shown that even mild hyponatremia is associated with impaired gait stability and increased falls. An increased risk of falls among elderly hyponatremic patients represents a risk factor for fractures, which would be further amplified if hyponatremia also contributed metabolically to bone loss. To evaluate this possibility, we studied a rat model of SIADH and analyzed data from the Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES III). In rats, dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) analysis of excised femurs established that hyponatremia for 3 months significantly reduced bone mineral density by approximately 30% compared with normonatremic control rats. Moreover, micro-computed tomography (ÂµCT) and histomorphometric analyses indicated that hyponatremia markedly reduced both trabecular and cortical bone via increased bone resorption and decreased bone formation. Analysis of data from adults in NHANES III by linear regression models showed that mild hyponatremia is associated with increased odds of osteoporosis (
