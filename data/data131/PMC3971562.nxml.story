Various treatment modalities have been described for retinal capillary hemangioma. Our purpose is to present a case of juxtapapillary retinal capillary hemangioma treated with photodynamic therapy. A 69-year-old woman with no previous ocular history presented with blurred vision and photopsias in the right eye three months ago. At presentation, her best corrected visual acuity was 6/9 in the right eye and 6/6 in the left eye. The anterior segment was totally normal and IOP was normal in both eyes as well. Dilated fundoscopy revealed a yellowish, well-circumscribed, elevated area with blood vessels, on the inferior margin of the right optic disc, as optic disc edema. Fluorescein angiography and angiogram with indocyanine green confirmed the diagnosis of juxtapapillary retinal capillary hemangioma. The patient was treated with photodynamic therapy with verteporfin and three months later her visual acuity was 6/7.5 in the right eye, while the lesion was slightly smaller. These findings remained stable at the one-year follow-up. In conclusion, photodynamic therapy offers promising anatomical and functional results for juxtapapillary retinal capillary hemangioma, providing visual acuity improvement or even stabilization and restriction of enlargement of the lesion.
