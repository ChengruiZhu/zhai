ST‐segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) patients (n=140) were monitored for total creatine kinase (CK) and cardiac troponin I (cTnI) over 72 hours postinfarction and were examined by cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) at 1 week and 6 months postinfarction. MI was generated in pigs with induced LVH (n=10) and in sham‐operated pigs (n=8), and serial total CK and cTnI measurements were performed and CMR scans conducted at 7 days postinfarction. Regression analysis was used to study the influence of LVH on total CK and cTnI release and IS estimated by CMR (gold standard). Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis was performed to study the discriminatory capacity of the area under the curve (AUC) of cTnI and total CK in predicting LV dysfunction. Cardiomyocyte cTnI expression was quantified in myocardial sections from LVH and sham‐operated pigs. In both the clinical and experimental studies, LVH was associated with significantly higher peak and AUC of cTnI, but not with differences in total CK. ROC curves showed that the discriminatory capacity of AUC of cTnI to predict LV dysfunction was significantly worse for patients with LVH. LVH did not affect the capacity of total CK to estimate IS or LV dysfunction. Immunofluorescence analysis revealed significantly higher cTnI content in hypertrophic cardiomyocytes.
