An important question in evolutionary developmental biology is how the complex organisms we see around us have evolved, and how this complexity is encoded in their DNA. An often heard statement is that the gene regulatory networks underlying developmental processes are modular; that is, different functions are carried out by largely independent network parts. It is argued that this network modularity allows both for robust functioning and evolutionary tinkering, and that selection thus produces modular networks. Here we use a simulation model for the evolution of animal body plan patterning to investigate these ideas. To allow for the evolution of modular networks we independently select for both body plan segmentation and differentiation. We find two distinct evolutionary trajectories, one in which segments evolve before domains, and one in which segments and domains evolve simultaneously. In addition, the two evolved network types also differ in terms of developmental dynamics. We show that indirect selection for robustness favors the segments first type networks. Furthermore, as a free side effect, these more robust networks are also more evolvable. Finally, we take into account both functional and architectural aspects to determine the modularity of the network types. We show that segments simultaneous networks generate segments and domains in a integrated manner, whereas segments first networks use largely independent modules to generate segments and domains. Finally, although mimicking natural developmental mechanisms was not part of our model design, the segments first developmental mechanisms resembles vertebrate axial patterning mechanisms. This resemblance arises for free, simply from considering segmentation and differentiation in combination.
