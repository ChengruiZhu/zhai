Apical hypertrophic cardiomyopathy is a rare form of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy that involves thickening of the distal portion of the left ventricular wall. Most commonly seen in the Japan, with a prevalence rate of about 15% of all HCM patient, its incidence in the USA is approximately 3% of HCM cases. We report a case of a 46-year-old woman with history of hypertension who presented to emergency department with worsening dyspnea and orthopnea with features of left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) and diffuse large T-wave inversions in the lateral leads on a 12-lead ECG. Further work up revealed severe concentric LVH, with near obliteration of the LV cavity. Ventriculogram showed severe symmetric hypertrophy of the mid to lower septum, extending to the apex of left ventricle with significant pressure gradient of at least 160 mmHg across the apex to mid septal cavity, with no significant gradient across the left ventricular outflow tract. These findings were consistent with apical hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. She was treated with verapamil and metoprolol and has remained asymptomatic over last 2.5 years of follow-up. Although the clinical presentation of AHCM can be variable and nonspecific; however, hallmark findings on ECG and echo can be extremely important in its diagnosis.
