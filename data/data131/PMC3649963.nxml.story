Nearly half of the human genome is composed of repetitive sequences, most of which were derived from transposable elements that have replicated in the genome during the evolution of our species. There is growing evidence showing that some of these transposon-derived sequences have been a source of new binding sites for various mammalian transcription factors. Considering that previous studies were targeting only few transcription factors and cell types, a key question that remains is to what extent the transposable elements have contributed to human transcriptional networks. To systematically survey this contribution, we used datasets generated by the international Encyclopedia of DNA Elements (ENCODE) consortium, identifying the location of active regulatory elements in more than 40 distinct human cell types. Using this resource we measured the contribution of all classes of repetitive sequences and systematically characterized the impact that transposable elements have had on the human chromatin landscape. Our results demonstrate that transposon-derived sequences have contributed hundreds of thousands of novel regulatory elements to the primate lineage and reshaped the human transcriptional landscape.
