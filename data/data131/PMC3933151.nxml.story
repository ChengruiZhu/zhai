Introduction: Biologic bone substitutes may offer alternatives to bone grafting procedures. The aim of this study was to evaluate a preformed bone substitute based on processed bovine cancellous bone (PBCB) with or without osteogenic cells in a critical size calvarial defect rat model. Methods: Discs of PBCB (TutoboneÂ®) were seeded with second passage fibrin gel-immobilized syngenic osteoblasts (group A, n = 40). Cell-free matrices (group B, n = 28) and untreated defects (group C; n=28) served as controls. Specimens were explanted between day 0 and 4 months after implantation and were subjected to histological and morphometric evaluation. Results: At 1 month, bone formation was limited to small peripheral areas. At 2 and 4 months, significant bone formation, matrix resorption as well as integration of the implants was evident in groups A and B. In group C no significant regeneration of the defects was observed. Morphometric analysis did not disclose differences in bone formation in matrices from groups A and B. Carboxyfluorescine-Diacetate-Succinimidylester (CFDA) labeling demonstrated low survival rates of transplanted cells. Discussion: Osteoblasts seeded into PBCB matrix display a differentiated phenotype following a 14 days cell culture period. Lack of initial vascularization may explain the absence of added osteogenicity in constructs from group A in comparison to group B. PBCB is well integrated and represents even without osteogenic cells a promising biomaterial for reconstruction of critical size calvarial bone defects.
