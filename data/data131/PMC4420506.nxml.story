Genomes of tumors are heavily enriched with mutations. Some of these mutations are distributed non-randomly, forming mutational clusters. Editing cytosine deaminases from APOBEC superfamily are responsible for the formation of many of these clusters. We have expressed APOBEC enzyme in diploid yeast cells and found that most of the mutations occur in the beginning of the active genes, where transcription starts. Clusters of mutations overlapped with promoters/transcription start sites. This is likely due to the weaker protection of ssDNA, an ultimate APOBEC deaminase enzyme target, in the beginning of the genes. This hypothesis was reinforced by the finding that inactivation of Sub1 transcription initiation factor, which is found predominantly in the regions of transcription initiation, leads to further increase in mutagenesis in the beginning of the genes. Interestingly, the total number of mutations in the genomes of Sub1-deficient clones did not change, despite the 100-fold decrease in frequency of mutants in a reporter gene. Thus, the drastic change in genome-wide distribution of mutations can be caused by inactivation of a single gene. We propose that the loss of ssDNA protection factors causes formation of mutation clusters in human cancer.
