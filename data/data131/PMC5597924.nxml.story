Nowadays there is no unique and well-established treatment for nonarteritic anterior ischemic optic neuropathy, despite being the main acute pathology that affects the optic nerve in the elderly population and often resulting in a significant loss of visual acuity. The effectiveness of oral steroids is still under debate in the international literature, although many studies show that patients treated with high doses of systemic corticosteroids have a significantly higher chance of improved visual acuity and visual fields. The authors propose an intravitreal dexamethasone injection/implant as initial and acute therapy. Compared to systemic corticosteroids, intravitreal dexamethasone has the advantage of avoiding any systemic side effects of steroids. On the other hand, a rise in intraocular pressure might occur, manageable with local antiglaucoma drugs, especially in patients at risk, and there is a risk of induced cataract. The pharmacodynamics of the intravitreal dexamethasone slow-release implant is characterized by a first step with high release concentrations and a second following phase with decreasing concentrations. Therefore, the use of emergency dexamethasone (high concentration) intravitreal injection is justified as a treatment after the first detection of an ischemic optic anterior neuropathy.
