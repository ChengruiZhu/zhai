, and serum protein. Conversely, within one log of the optimal yield of virus was formed by HeLa cells in a medium containing only glucose, glutamine, and salts, even if the cells had been starved in this medium for 12 hours prior to their inoculation. The presence of glucose alone caused an average 170-fold increase in viral output beyond the amounts formed by the glucose- and glutamine-depleted cells. The addition of glutamine alone caused an average 2000-fold increase; and the addition of both increased the viral formation 40,000-fold. Qualitatively similar results were obtained with unstarved cells, not previously depleted of glucose and glutamine. It follows that only a small proportion of HeLa cells are capable of forming virus unless either glucose or glutamine, or both, are present in the medium. The elaboration of virus was significantly delayed in media containing glucose but no glutamine. The absence of glucose and glutamine did not prevent the fixation of poliomyelitis virus by the cell. When these compounds were added to previously depleted cells even 6 hours after inoculation, and after the excess free virus had been removed by washing and by the addition of specific antiserum, normal amounts of virus were formed despite the degenerative changes caused by the previous glucose and glutamine deprivation. Possible functions of glucose and glutamine in the elaboration of virus are discussed in the text. Such factors other than glucose, glutamine, or salts (
