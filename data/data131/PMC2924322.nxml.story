The On-Off direction-selective ganglion cell (DSGC) found in mammalian retinas generates a directional signal, responding most strongly to a stimulus moving in a specific direction. The DSGC initiates spikes in its dendritic tree which are thought to propagate to the soma and brain with high probability. Both dendritic and somatic spikes in the DSGC display strong directional tuning, whereas postsynaptic potentials (PSPs) recorded in the soma are only weakly directional, indicating that postsynaptic spike generation markedly enhances the directional signal. We constructed a realistic computational model to determine the source of the enhancement. Our results indicate that the DSGC dendritic tree is partitioned into separate computational regions. Within each region, the local spike threshold produces nonlinear amplification of the preferred response over the null response on the basis of PSP amplitude. The simulation results showed that inhibition acts locally within the dendritic arbor and will not stop dendritic spikes from propagating. We identified the role of three mechanisms that generate direction selectivity in the local dendritic regions, which suggests the origin of the previously described “non-direction-selective region,” and also suggests that the known DS in the synaptic inputs is apparently necessary for robust DS across the dendritic tree.
