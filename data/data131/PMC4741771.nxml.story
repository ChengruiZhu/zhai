We conducted a prospective genomic screening trial with high throughput sequencing and copy number variation (CNV) assay, and immunohistochemistry array in metastatic solid cancer patients. We used Ion AmpliSeq Cancer Hotspot Panel v2 and nCounter Copy Number Variation Assay (21 genes) to identify molecular targets for potential matched therapy. Metastatic solid tumor patients were prospectively consented for molecular profiling tests. The primary outcome for this trial was the feasibility of molecular tests and response rate (matched vs non-matched treatment). Between November 2013 and August 2014, a total of 428 metastatic solid tumor patients were enrolled on to this study. The mutational profiles were obtained for 407 (95.1%) patients. CNV 21-gene assays were successfully performed in 281 (65.7%) of 428 patients. Of the 407 patients with molecular profiling results, 342 (84.0%) patients had one or more aberrations detected. Of the 342 patients, 103 patients were matched to molecularly targeted agents in the context of clinical trials or clinical practice. The response rate was significantly higher in the genome-matched treated group for gastrointestinal/hepatobiliary/rare tumors (matched vs non-matched treatment, 42.6% vs 24.3%,
