Retinal vessels provide a window to microvascular systems elsewhere in the body. The diameter of retinal vessels varies between racial/ethnic groups, being generally wider in African Americans compared to European Americans. To determine whether genetic background may contribute to this observed difference, we scanned the entire genomes of 1,737 African Americans, searching for genomic regions where individuals with either wider retinal venular or narrower retinal arteriolar caliber have a difference from the average percentage of African ancestry. We find that the percentage of African ancestry is positively correlated with retinal venular caliber, particularly in the hypertensive individuals. We detect substantive evidence of association between excess African ancestry and wider retinal venular caliber on chromosome 6p21.1 in the hypertensives, but not in the non-hypertensives. The 6p21.1 region contains genes that are known to be involved in development and modulation and of retinal vessels. Our results suggest that genetic factors may contribute to the observed difference in retinal vascular caliber between African Americans and European Americans. Further fine-mapping studies of the genomic region may identify variants affecting retinal vascular caliber.
