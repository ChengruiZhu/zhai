Typically both copies of mammalian genes are expressed, but in some cases, “imprinting” restricts expression to the maternal or paternal copy. Having two copies of each gene is considered advantageous since in enables compensation when one does not function properly. Why imprinting evolved and its utility to each sex is widely debated, and having a complete catalog of imprinted genes and their functions is essential for fully characterizing this phenomenon. 25 years of screening has revealed about 130 imprinted genes, and the slowing rate of discovery suggests that we are reaching saturation. Two recent studies based on high-throughput sequencing of RNA reported more than 1,300 imprinted genes. To understand the basis of this paradigm shift, we first attempted to reproduce these results. Unable to do so, we performed additional analyses that show that most of these discoveries are due to noise in the experimental approach and assay. We remedy this with new methods that account for this noise and applied them to identify 50 novel putative imprinted genes. These methods will be useful for identifying genuine novel cases of imprinted expression as this type of screening approach becomes broadly utilized.
