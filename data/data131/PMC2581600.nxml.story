It has long been hypothesized that in addition to structural changes to proteins, changes in gene regulation might underlie many of the anatomic and behavioral differences between humans and other primates. However, to date, there are only a handful of examples of regulatory adaptations in humans. In this work, we present a genome-wide study of gene expression levels in livers, kidneys, and hearts from three species: humans, chimpanzees, and rhesus macaques. These data allowed us to identify genes and entire pathways in which regulation evolved under natural selection and therefore are likely to be functionally important. Our results provide some of the first examples of pathways that have been remodeled specifically in the human lineage. In particular, we find that the regulation of a large number of genes involved in metabolic pathways evolved under lineage-specific directional selection. This result is intriguing, because, in addition to the obvious cognitive and linguistic differences between humans and non-human apes, a clear lifestyle shift between us and other primates can be found in our diet. We also found evidence for tissue-specific selection pressures on gene regulation, an observation that provides strong support to the notion that adaptive circumscribed changes in gene regulation have fewer deleterious pleiotropic effects compared with changes at the protein sequence level.
