 (Guen√©e) (Lepidoptera: Crambidae) was investigated. It was found that mated females with both antennae amputated, in contrast to intact females and females with one antenna removed, could not discriminate between simultaneously provided control filter papers and filters treated with a blend of oviposition-deterring fatty acids. Oviposition by mated females exhibited a very marked periodicity, with all egg masses deposited during the scotophase and most egg masses laid before midnight. According to the peak and trough period of oviposition, electroantennogram (EAG) responses from both mated females and males to the four fatty acids and four methyl esters were tested within two two-hour periods from 3 to 5 hours after the start of darkness and from 1 to 3 hours after light onset, respectively. Significant EAG responses above solvent and background were elicited by all test chemicals from females, and by most of the test compounds from males. EAG values of all test chemicals from mated females were not statistically different between the two test periods except for methyl myristate. Conversely, EAG responses from mated males to myristic acid, stearic acid and their methyl esters significantly differed between the two test periods.
