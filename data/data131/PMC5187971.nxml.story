Small-sided games provide young soccer players with better opportunities to develop their skills and progress as individual and team players. There is, however, little evidence on the effectiveness of different game formats in different age groups, and furthermore, these formats can vary between and even within countries. The Royal Spanish Soccer Association replaced the traditional grassroots 7-a-side format (F-7) with the 8-a-side format (F-8) in the 2011-12 season and the countryâ€™s regional federations gradually followed suit. The aim of this observational methodology study was to investigate which of these formats best suited the learning needs of U-10 players transitioning from 5-aside futsal. We built a multiple logistic regression model to predict the success of offensive moves depending on the game format and the area of the pitch in which the move was initiated. Success was defined as a shot at the goal. We also built two simple logistic regression models to evaluate how the game format influenced the acquisition of technicaltactical skills. It was found that the probability of a shot at the goal was higher in F-7 than in F-8 for moves initiated in the Creation Sector-Own Half (0.08 vs 0.07) and the Creation Sector-Opponent's Half (0.18 vs 0.16). The probability was the same (0.04) in the Safety Sector. Children also had more opportunities to control the ball and pass or take a shot in the F-7 format (0.24 vs 0.20), and these were also more likely to be successful in this format (0.28 vs 0.19).
