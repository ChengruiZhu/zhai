As a consequence of problems during cell division, the number of copies of a gene in a chromosome can either increase or decrease. These copy-number alterations (CNAs) can play a crucial role in the emergence of complex multigenic diseases. For example, in cancer, amplification of oncogenes can drive tumor activation, and CNAs are associated with metastasis development and patient survival. Studies on the relationship between CNAs and disease have been recently fueled by the widespread use of array-based comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH), a technique with much finer resolution than previous experimental approaches. Detection of CNAs from these data depends on methods of analysis that do not impose biologically unrealistic assumptions and that provide direct answers to fundamental research questions. We have developed a statistical method, using a Bayesian approach, that returns estimates of the probabilities of CNAs from aCGH data, the most direct and valuable answer to the key biological question: “What is the probability that this gene/region has an altered copy number?” The output of the method can therefore be immediately used in different settings from clinical to basic research scenarios, and is applicable over a wide variety of aCGH technologies.
