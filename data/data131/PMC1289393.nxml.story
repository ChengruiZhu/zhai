Eukaryotic cells are divided into various morphologically and functionally distinct compartments. Proteins must be targeted to the appropriate compartment to ensure proper function. Understanding protein subcellular localization is important to help understand not only the function of individual proteins but also the organization of the cell as a whole. Bioinformatic predictors of localization can provide such information quickly for large numbers of proteins. The authors of this paper have created a localization predictor called PSLT2 that considers the combinatorial presence of protein motifs and domains as well as protein interactions in yeast proteins. PSLT2 can predict the localization of all yeast proteins to nine different compartments: the endoplasmic reticulum, Golgi apparatus, cytosol, nucleus, peroxisome, plasma membrane, lysosome, mitochondrion, and extracellular space. The authors also investigated how to identify and predict proteins that localize to more than one compartment. They compared the localization predictions of PSLT2 to those determined through high-throughput tagging and microscopy experiments for yeast proteins. Disagreements between these methods generally involve proteins that transit through or reside in the secretory pathway.
