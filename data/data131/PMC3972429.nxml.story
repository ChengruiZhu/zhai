Glucocorticoids (GCs) are steroid hormones that have inflammatory and immunosuppressive effects on a wide variety of cells. They are used as therapy for inflammatory disease and as a common agent against edema. The blood brain barrier (BBB), comprising microvascular endothelial cells, serves as a permeability screen between the blood and the brain. As such, it maintains homeostasis of the central nervous system (CNS). In many CNS disorders, BBB integrity is compromised. GC treatment has been demonstrated to improve the tightness of the BBB. The responses and effects of GCs are mediated by the ubiquitous GC receptor (GR). Ligand-bound GR recognizes and binds to the GC response element located within the promoter region of target genes. Transactivation of certain target genes leads to improved barrier properties of endothelial cells. In this review, we deal with the role of GCs in endothelial cell barrier function. First, we describe the mechanisms of GC action at the molecular level. Next, we discuss the regulation of the BBB by GCs, with emphasis on genes targeted by GCs such as occludin, claudins and VE-cadherin. Finally, we present currently available GC therapeutic strategies and their limitations.
