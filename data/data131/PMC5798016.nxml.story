There was a total of 250 patients with 259 renal biopsies available for our analysis. Our patients were of multi-ethnic origins with a female predominance (90%). Their mean ± standard deviation age was 37.7 ± 12.8 years. The patients had a mean disease duration of 135.6 ± 81.9 months. Nephrotic syndrome was the most common presentation (29.6%) and acute renal failure was evident at initial presentation in 16% of patients. Class IV LN was the predominant biopsy class within the cohort (66.8%). The majority of patients achieved remission (81.2%) and had normal renal function (83.9%) at the last follow-up. The 5-, 10-, 15- and 20-year survival rates for our cohort were 93%, 88%, 82% and 77%, respectively. There were 37 deaths (14.8%), of which the main causes were: infection and flare (52.7%), infection alone (25.0%) and other causes (22.3%). Independent predictors of mortality in our cohort of LN patients were: the presence of acute kidney injury at presentation [hazard ratio (HR) 3.41; confidence interval (CI) 1.50–7.76], failure to achieve remission at 1-year post-induction therapy (HR 2.99; CI 1.35–6.65) and non-compliance with treatment (HR 1.89; CI 1.22–2.96). Age, ethnicity, class of LN and type of immunosuppressant used were not predictive of mortality.
