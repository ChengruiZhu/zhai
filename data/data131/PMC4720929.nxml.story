Sialendoscopy is a new diagnostic and surgical tool for management of salivary gland diseases that offers the opportunity to treat selected pathologies less invasively and with better results compared to previous techniques. As with any new technique, an adequate training programme involving a gradual learning curve is mandatory to quickly obtain results similar to those reported in the literature. This includes an appropriate diagnostic programme, correct patient selection and knowledge of possible pitfalls. In this retrospective study, the outcomes of the first 141 procedures (74 on the parotid gland and 67 on the submandibular gland) performed with this technique in our Department from 2009 to 2013 were compared with those reported in the literature. Patients were divided into three groups: Group A (the first 49 procedures performed), Group B (the next 50 procedures), and Group C (the last 42 procedures). There were no statistically significant differences relative to mean procedure times, recurrence of symptomatology after treatment, need for further treatments and rates of minor complications between groups. No major complications were seen. The increase in experience resulted in an increased number of interventional sialendoscopies performed under local anaesthesia instead of general anaesthesia (51% vs 18%
