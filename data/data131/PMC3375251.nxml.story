Establishing how inhibitory neurons shape the computing functions of neural circuits is crucial to understanding both normal function and dysfunction in the human brain. It has been known for over a century that different classes of inhibitory interneurons project to different sub-regions of the neurons they contact – some primarily target cell bodies, others the dendrites, still others the axon. It remains poorly understood, however, how these different projection patterns influence synaptic integration in the target neuron populations. By providing new data from intracellular recordings in brain slices, and a simple but powerful model of the location-dependent effects of inhibition on dendritic spike generation, our study (1) demonstrates the importance of the absolute and relative locations of excitatory and inhibitory inputs to pyramidal neurons, the principal cells of the cerebral cortex, and (2) helps to establish a more solid theoretical understanding of these complex integrative phenomena. As high resolution mapping of the cortical “connectome” becomes available in the coming years, our work will be helpful in interpreting the computing functions of cortical tissue both at the single neuron and circuit levels.
