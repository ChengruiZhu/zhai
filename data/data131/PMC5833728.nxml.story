As tissue engineering and regenerative medicine have evolved recently, stem cell therapy has been investigated in the field of impaired wound healing. Several studies have reported that mesenchymal stem cells derived from various tissues including bone marrow and adipose tissue can exert the regenerative efficacy in the wound healing. Previously, we have demonstrated the isolation and characterization of tonsil-derived mesenchymal stem cells (TMSCs) with excellent proliferative property. In the present study, we aimed to evaluate the regenerative efficacy of TMSCs in the wound healing process. Two distinct cutaneous surgical defects were generated in the dorsum of mice. Each wound was treated with TMSCs or phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), respectively. After sacrifice, the skin and subcutaneous tissues around the surgical defect were harvested and assessed for inflammation, re-epithelialization, dermal regeneration, and granulation tissue formation. The administration of TMSCs into wound beds significantly promoted the repair of surgical defects in mice. Especially, TMSCs efficiently contributed to the attenuation of excessive inflammation in the surgical lesion, as well as the augmentation of epidermal and dermal regeneration. To elucidate the underlying mechanisms, TMSCs were analyzed for their potency in immunomodulatory ability on immune cells, stimulatory effect on the proliferation of keratinocytes, and fibroblasts, as well as the regulation of fibroblast differentiation. TMSCs inhibited the non-specific or T-cell-specific proliferation of peripheral blood mononuclear cells, as well as the M1 polarization of macrophage-like cells. Moreover, TMSCs augmented the proliferation of skin-constituting fibroblasts and keratinocytes while they suppressed the differentiation of fibroblasts into myofibroblasts. Taken together, our findings demonstrate the regenerative potential of TMSCs in wound healing process through the regulation on inflammation, proliferation, and remodeling of various skin cells, implying that TMSCs can be a promising alternative for wound repair.
