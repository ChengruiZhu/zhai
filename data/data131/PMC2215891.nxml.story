A mechanism of the long-term potentiation of transmitter release induced by adrenaline (ALTP) was studied by recording intracellularly the fast excitatory postsynaptic potentials (fast EPSPs). The ALTP was produced during the blockade of K+ channels at the presynaptic terminals by tetraethylammonium (TEA). The synaptic delay, possibly reflecting a relative change in the duration of an action potential at the presynaptic terminal, was not changed during the course of the ALTP. By contrast, it was significantly lengthened by TEA and other K+ channel inhibitors (4-aminopyridine and Cs+) that markedly enhanced the evoked release of transmitter. The magnitude of facilitation of the fast EPSP, induced by a conditional stimulus to the preganglionic nerve, was decreased during the generation of the ALTP, but was unchanged during the potentiation of transmitter release caused by TEA. These results, together with theoretical considerations applying the residual Ca2+ hypothesis to the facilitation, suggest that the enhancement of transmitter release during the ALTP is not caused by an increased Ca2+ influx during a presynaptic impulse owing to the blockade of K+ channel or the modulation of Ca2+ channel, but presumably is induced by a rise in the basal level of free Ca2+ in the presynaptic terminal.
