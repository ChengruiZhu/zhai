Our patient presented with progressive lower extremity weakness, bowel and bladder incontinence, and back pain in the setting of childhood repair of myelomeningocele and two previous detethering procedures. SSVO was offered to the patient as further detethering was deemed to have significant risk. A discectomy at T11-T12 via the lateral retropleural approach was performed, followed by a T12 partial corpectomy removing the vertebral body down to the inferior aspect of the T12 pedicle, followed by the removal of the ipsilateral pedicle. The T10, T11, L1, and L2 pedicle screws were then placed in the prone position and temporary rods were placed for temporary stability, followed by a laminectomy at T12 and a facetectomy for posterior element release.Â The remaining pedicle was removed, permanent rods were sequentially placed, and spinal column shortening was achieved by compression against the rods. Standing lateral radiographs demonstrated 19 millimeters (mm) of shortening after the intervention. The patient remained at her neurologic baseline postoperatively. At the six-month follow-up, the patient reported decreased lower extremity radicular pain and improved bowel and bladder function.
