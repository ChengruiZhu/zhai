Variability among members of a clonal cell population is increasingly recognized as a near-universal characteristic of prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells. Variability can arise from random fluctuations in the biochemical reactions that control gene transcription, protein synthesis or signal transduction networks. For variability in receptor-mediated signaling responses (in the current work, those activated by the death-inducing ligand TRAIL), we can often distinguish between the influence of stochastic processes that occur prior to ligand exposure and those that occur subsequently. One manifestation of prior variability is cell-to-cell differences in protein concentrations, and this paper uses a combination of modeling and experimentation to ask how these differences impact variability in phenotype, specifically with respect to the timing and probability of cell death. We find that fluctuations in multiple proteins contribute jointly to phenotypic variability, that the contributions of specific proteins to phenotypic variability are highly sensitive to the concentrations of other proteins, and that correlations in protein levels (detectable experimentally) also have a measurable impact on phenotype. Our work provides insight into the regulation of apoptosis and also represents a general approach for understanding cell-to-cell variability in signal transduction pathways.
