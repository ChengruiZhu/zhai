Pulsed radiofrequency (PRF) is effective in the treatment of neuropathic pain in clinical practice. Its application to sites proximal to nerve injury can inhibit the activity of extra-cellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) for up to 28 days. The spared nerve injury (SNI)+ immPRF group (immediate exposure to PRF for 6 min after SNI) exhibited a greater anti-allodynic effect compared with the control group (SNI alone) or the SNI + postPRF group (application of PRF for 6 min on the 14th day after SNI). Insulin-like growth factor 2 (IGF2) was selected using microarray assays and according to web-based gene ontology annotations in the SNI + immPRF group. An increase in IGF2 and activation of ERK1/2 were attenuated by the immPRF treatment compared with an SNI control group. Using immunofluorescent staining, we detected co-localized phosphorylated ERK1/2 and IGF2 in the dorsal horn regions of rats from the SNI group, where the IGF2 protein predominantly arose in CD11b- or NeuN-positive cells, whereas IGF2 immunoreactivity was not detected in the SNI + immPRF group. Taken together, these results suggest that PRF treatment immediately after nerve injury significantly inhibited the development of neuropathic pain with a lasting effect, most likely through IGF2 down-regulation and the inhibition of ERK1/2 activity primarily in microglial cells.
