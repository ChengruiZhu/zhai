Epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is the process by which cancer cells lose their epithelial characteristics and obtain a mesenchymal phenotype that is thought to allow them to migrate away from the primary tumor. A better understanding of how EMT is controlled would be valuable in predicting the likelihood of metastasis and in designing targeted therapies to block metastatic progression. While there have been many studies on the contribution of changes in gene expression to EMT, much less is known regarding the role of alternative splicing of mRNA during EMT. Alternative splicing can produce different protein isoforms from the same gene that often have distinct activities and functions. Here, we used a recently developed method to characterize changes in alternative splicing during EMT and found that thousands of multi-exon genes underwent alternative splicing. Alternative isoform expression was confirmed in human breast cancer cell lines and in primary human breast cancer samples, indicating that EMTâ€“dependent splicing changes occur commonly in human tumors. Since EMT is considered an early step in metastatic progression, novel markers of EMT that we identified in human breast cancer samples might become valuable prognostic and diagnostic tools if confirmed in a larger cohort of patients.
