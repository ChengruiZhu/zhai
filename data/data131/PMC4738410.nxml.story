 stimulation of DNA‐damaged cells. The aim of this study is to examine the dose‐dependent effect of PPI on periampullary cancers in a national population‐based cohort. A nested case–control analysis was constructed based on Taiwan's National Health Insurance Research Database and the Taiwan Cancer Registry between the years 2000 and 2010. Cases involving patients diagnosed with periampullary cancers were selected and controls were matched to cases according to age, sex and observational period. A “PPI user” was defined as any patient receiving more than 28 cumulative defined daily doses as measured by prescription drug claims. Conditional logistic regression analysis was conducted to calculate odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) according to the level of PPI exposure. A total of 7,681 cases and 76,762 matched controls were included with a mean follow‐up period of 6.6 years (SD: 2.0). The odds of PPI exposure in patients with periampullary cancers were higher than that of control patients with an adjusted OR of 1.35 (95% CIs: 1.16–1.57). Our results also showed that PPI exposure was slightly linked to periampullary cancers in dose‐dependent manner. A similar association was observed in patients who solely took PPI but no eradication therapy for
