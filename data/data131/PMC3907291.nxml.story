Most people who become infected with HIV generate a strong antibody response to the infecting virus population. Unfortunately, the protection offered by the antibody is short lived as the virus rapidly mutates and renders the antibodies impotent in preventing further infection. There are a few antibodies, however, that have been isolated from infected individuals that can block infection by many different viral strains. Among these are several that target sites on the HIV that are exposed only after the virus has attached to a cell. These antibodies have a brief window of time to prevent fusion of the virus and cell. They are special in that they bind both to the viral membrane and to sequences on the gp41 protein that lie along the viral surface. Here, we present a model that predicts the concentrations at which these antibodies effectively neutralize the virus. The model tells us what properties of antibody binding are key in determining efficient neutralization and what properties have little influence. A prediction of the model is that in a standard neutralization assay there are only a small number of attachments between virus and cell and disabling these is sufficient to prevent infection.
