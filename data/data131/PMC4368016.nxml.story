Context: Trigeminal neuralgia is as a chronic, debilitating condition, which can have a major impact on quality of life. There are few reports of trigeminal neuralgia in oriental populations. 
Objectives: To evaluate the retrospective data of the patients diagnosed with idiopathic trigeminal neuralgia and to understanding the disorder in the Indian populace. 
Methods: The retrospective data of 72 patients with typical idiopathic trigeminal neuralgia regarding age of onset, gender, site of involvement, clinical presentations and treatment received during three years of the follow up was collected and analyzed. 
Results: In the present retrospective study, the mean age was 54.9 years; female to male ratio was 2.13:1; rural to urban ratio 1.76:1 with 62.5% suffered trigeminal neuralgic pain on the right side. Carbamazepine was found to be highly effective in 60.8% of the cases on long-term basis with maintenance doses. Other treatment modalities were employed in more refractory cases including add-on of gabapentin, which relieved the symptoms for an additional duration of 13±3months. The neurolytic alcohol bloc was given in 30% of patients who stopped responding to combination of carbamazepine and gabapentin and relieved pain for a mean duration of 17.25±2.95 months. Twenty three percent of the patients (23%) required peripheral neurectomy. 
Conclusions: Carbamazepine was found to be highly effective in trigeminal neuralgia. Other treatment modality includes add-on of gabapentin, neurolytic alcohol blocs and peripheral surgical intervention in more refractory cases. Only limited cases needed further neurological consideration.
