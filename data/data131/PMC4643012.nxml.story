, in which local interactions lead to patterns as large-scale collective”modes” of the system. Over more than half a century, these patterns have been classified and analyzed according to a”physics paradigm,” investigating such questions as how parameters regulate the transitions among patterns, which (types of) interactions lead to such large-scale patterns, and whether there are "critical parameter values" marking the sharp, spontaneous onset of patterns. A fundamental discovery has been that simple local interaction rules can lead to complex large-scale patterns. The specific pattern "layouts" (i.e., their spatial arrangement and their geometric constraints) have received less attention. However, there is a major difference between patterns in physics and chemistry on the one hand and patterns in biology on the other: in biology, patterns often have an important functional role for the biological system and can be considered to be under evolutionary selection. From this perspective, we can expect that individual biological elements exert some control on the emerging patterns. Here we explore spiral wave patterns as a prominent example to illustrate the regulation of spatiotemporal patterns by biological variability. We propose a new approach to studying spatiotemporal data in biology: analyzing the correlation between the spatial distribution of the constituents’ properties and the features of the spatiotemporal pattern. This general concept is illustrated by simulated patterns and experimental data of a model organism of biological pattern formation, the slime mold
