Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of plasma lipoprotein fractions hold great promise for understanding lipid metabolism and its central role in cardiovascular disease and related disorders. Conventional assays for lipoprotein status determine total cholesterol content of low- or high-density lipoprotein particles (LDL-C or HDL-C, respectively) or total plasma triglyceride content (as an estimate of very-low density lipoprotein particle concentration [VLDL]). All three measures have been targets for recent GWAS. However, a more precise target for GWAS of lipoprotein metabolism would be the concentration of the individual lipoprotein particles according to class (LDL, HDL, VLDL) and size (small, medium, and large), all of which can be measured by NMR-based methods. In a population of 17,296 women of European ancestry from the Women's Genome Health Study, we have performed a GWAS for 22 lipoprotein measures derived from NMR-based and conventional assays. We find 43 genetic loci involved in lipoprotein metabolism, including 10 novel loci. The results offer a clearer picture of common genetic influences on lipoprotein metabolism than available previously, including genetic effects on the distribution of LDL, HDL, and VLDL particle size, as well as on IDL and VLDL particle concentration, neither of which can be assessed by conventional measures.
