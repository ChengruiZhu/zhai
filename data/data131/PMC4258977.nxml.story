Time required for nasotracheal intubation was significantly less in group Groups MD and MS, as compared with the control group, but not significant between the two groups. (Group MD: 9.05 + 1.95 min, Group MS 3.75 + 0.75 min and Group S 16.85 + 1.7 min). However, the number of fiberoptic intubation was significantly more in the MD and MS groups, as compared with the control group. Easy intubation (control group: 0, Group MD: 25 and Group MS: 35), moderate difficulty (control group: 5, Group MD: 12 and Group MS: 4) and difficult (control group: 35, Group MD: 3 and Group MS: 1). Procedure adverse events were significantly lower in Group MS. None of the patients in Group MS had procedure hypoxia, but it occurred in 10 patients of Group MD and 20 patients in Group S. Six patients in Group S and two in Group MD had procedure apnea whereas, none of the patients in the MS group experienced this. After medication and just before intubation heart rate and mean arterial pressure were significantly less in Groups MD and MS, as compared to the control group (Group MD: 77 + 7.7 beat/min, Group MS: 70 + 5.6 beat/min and Group S: 80 + 7.8 beat/min) (Group MD: 90 + 8.5 mmHg, Group MS: 80 + 8.1 mmHg and Group S: 105 + 10.5 mmHg). This difference however, significant between Group MD and Group MS.
