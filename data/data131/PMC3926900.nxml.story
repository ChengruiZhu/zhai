The Inhibitor-κB Kinase-Nuclear Factor-κB (IKK-NF-κB) and Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor-Activator Protein-1 (EGFR-AP-1) pathways are often co-activated and promote malignant behavior, but the underlying basis for this relationship is unclear. Resistance to inhibitors of IKKβ or EGFR is observed in head and neck squamous cell carcinomas (HNSCC). Here, we reveal that both IKKα and β contribute to nuclear activation of canonical and alternate NF-κB/REL family transcription factors, and overexpression of signal components enhancing co-activation of the EGFR-AP1 pathway. We observed that IKKα and IKKβ exhibit increased protein expression, nuclear localization and phosphorylation in HNSCC tissues and cell lines. Individually, IKK activity varied amongst different cell lines, but overexpression of both IKKs induced the strongest NF-κB activation. Conversely, siRNA knockdown of both IKKs significantly decreased nuclear localization and phosphorylation of canonical RELA and IκBα, and alternative p52 and RELB subunits. Knockdown of both IKKs more effectively inhibited NF-κB activation, broadly modulated gene expression, and suppressed cell proliferation and migration. Global expression profiling revealed that NF-κB, cytokine, inflammatory response, and growth factor signaling are among the top pathways and networks regulated by IKKs. Importantly, IKKα and IKKβ together promoted the expression and activity of TGFα, EGFR, and AP1 transcription factors cJun, JunB, and Fra1. Knockdown of AP1 subunits individually decreased 8/15 (53%) of IKK-targeted genes sampled, and similarly inhibited cell proliferation and migration. Mutations of NF-κB and AP1 binding sites abolished or decreased IKK-induced
