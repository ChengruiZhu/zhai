Primary central nervous system lymphoma (PCNSL) is characterized as an extra-nodal non-Hodgkin lymphoma which develops from the neuraxis. The purpose was to report a case of a patient with a supra-tentorial tumor who underwent subtotal resection of his tumor as his biopsy was not indicative of a PCNSL tumor and had uneventful recovery until his last follow-up. A 42-year-old man was admitted to our department for generalized epileptic seizures. CT and MRI examinations revealed a tumor in his right parietal-occipital lobe that was surrounded by edema and was enhancing after gadolinium administration. The patient underwent a navigation-assisted parieto-occipital craniotomy and posterior parietal transcortical approach for tumor biopsy which was not indicative of PCNSL tumor. The surgical team decided to remove the tumor on site. Histological analysis of the resected specimen showed primary diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. Combined chemotherapy and radiation therapy was applied to the patient, and at his last follow-up (16 months), he is tumor free. In our case as in several other studies during the last decade, the outcome after the surgical resection of a PCNSL tumor in combination to radiation and chemotherapy was unexpectedly good. The role of surgery probably should be reconsidered for single lesion PCNSL tumors.
