Radiotherapy is an effective treatment method for cancers. During radiation treatment, a patient must be in the same position from the start to the end of radiation treatment. Patient movements are usually monitored by the radiation technologists through the closed circuit television (CCTV) during treatment. If the patient makes a small movement, it is difficult to be noticed by them. In the present work, a simple patient movement monitoring device (PMMD) is fabricated to monitor the patient movement. It uses an electronic sensing device. It continuously monitors the patient's position while the radiation treatment is in process. The device has been retrospectively tested on 86 patients whose movement and distance were measured. The results show that 24 patients moved 1 cm to 2.5 cm from their initial position during the external beam radiotherapy (EBRT). Hence, the device can potentially be used to control and monitor patient movement during EBRT. In addition, an audible alarm situated at the control panel of the treatment room is provided with this device to alert the radiation technologists. It is an inexpensive, compact device which can be used in any radiotherapy machine. It can prevent patients from being treated in a wrong position and therefore improve the quality of the radiation treatment.
