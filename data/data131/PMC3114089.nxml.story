Mouse experimental models are commonly utilized tools in biomedical research but remain underrepresented in vocal fold biology, presumably due to the small size of the larynx and limited description of the anatomical, cellular and extracellular composition of the vocal folds. In this study, we provide a whole-mount serial section-based histological description of vocal fold morphology of wild-type FVB strain mice, alongside a histological and immunohistochemical (IHC)-based quantitative analysis of extracellular matrix (ECM) alteration 1, 7, 14, 28, 42 and 56 days following unilateral vocal fold injury. IHC was specific for procollagen type I, collagen type I, collagen type III, collagen type IV, elastin, decorin, fibronectin and hyaluronic acid binding protein 2. The histological description confirmed the presence of a laryngeal alar structural complex in the mouse, which appears to be a morphological feature unique to rodents. The lamina propria appeared uniform without evidence of a distinct layer structure as has been reported in larger animals and humans. Time-dependent alterations in vocal fold morphology, ECM organization and ECM protein/glycoconjugate abundance were observed in injured vocal folds compared to control. The presence of a mature scar was observed between 28 and 42 days postinjury. Morphological and ECM changes following vocal fold injury in the mouse were generally consistent with those reported in other animal models, particularly the rat, although wound repair in the mouse appears to occur at a faster rate.
