Orthologs are proteins in different species sharing the same function and structure. However, the mechanisms that underline the divergence of different sequences from a single ancestor remain unclear, particularly because many amino acid exchanges between orthologs result in loss of function (incompatibility). We aimed at disentangling an ancient divergence event within the active-site of a universally spread enzyme that mediates ATP synthesis. Using laboratory evolution experiments, we found that an exchange in a functionally critical active-site residue that is incompatible within contemporary orthologs is enabled by few mutations. These mutations lead to transition sequences in which, unlike the extant sequences, a wide range of amino acids is tolerated. Our experiment reveals the properties of these transition sequences that may resemble the historical ancestral states that underlined this divergence event, and the mechanisms that led to incompatibility within the contemporary orthologs. Our results support theoretical predictions and reshape our understanding of protein structure-function. That a given position is entirely conserved and essential for function does not indicate that it will never exchange, but rather, that the exchange may depend on changes in many other positions.
