Sphingosylphosphorylcholine induces keratin phosphorylation and reorganization, and increases viscoelasticity of metastatic cancer cells such as PANC-1 cells. However, the mechanism involved in sphingosylphosphorylcholine-induced keratin phosphorylation and reorganization is largely unknown. Sphingosylphosphorylcholine dose- and time-dependently induces the expression of RhebL1. The involvement of RhebL1 in sphingosylphosphorylcholine-induced events including keratin 8 (K8) phosphorylation, reorganization, migration and invasion was examined. Gene silencing of RhebL1 suppressed the sphingosylphosphorylcholine-induced events and overexpression of RhebL1 enhanced those events even without sphingosylphosphorylcholine treatment. We examined whether the G protein function of RhebL1 induces K8 phosphorylation using constitutively active RhebL1Q64L and dominant negative RhebL1D60K. G protein activity of RhebL1 is involved in sphingosylphosphorylcholine-induced K8 phosphorylation. We found that RhebL1 binds and activates AKT1. G protein activity of RhebL1 is involved in the binding and activation of AKT1. MK2206 (AKT inhibitor) and gene silencing of AKT1 inhibited the sphingosylphosphorylcholine-induced events, whereas overexpression of activated-AKT1 induced K8 phosphorylation, reorganization, migration and invasion even without sphingosylphosphorylcholine treatment.
