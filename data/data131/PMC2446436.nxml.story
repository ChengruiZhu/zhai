Before many animals first open their eyes, neurons in the retina, thalamus, and visual cortex fire spontaneously in highly structured, patterned ways. Experimental manipulations have demonstrated that this activity is necessary for proper function, but it is difficult to answer certain fundamental questions about the role of this activity by using experimental manipulations alone. We know that the early visual system can adapt to better encode statistical regularities in the environment. Can the same learning system that adapts to natural input be applied to this patterned activity to learn the visual code before birth? What qualities would we want in an instructional pattern of activity in the developing visual system? We answer these questions by presenting an abstract model of spontaneous activity in the early visual system—with direct relations to more physiological models. We demonstrate that instructive statistical properties can exist in spontaneously generated patterns based on very simple, local interactions. Also, we demonstrate that these patterns not only have the necessary pairwise correlations, which previous models have relied upon, but also additional sparse, edge-like structure. This higher-order statistical structure is universal to natural visual scenes and is necessary to understand neural responses as an efficient coding of our natural world. Most importantly, this additional structure would allow the visual system to use the same adaptive efficient coding strategy in two cases previously treated as separate—learning from natural visual experience as well as through innately generated patterns before visual experience.
