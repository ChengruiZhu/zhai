Neuronal oscillations play a key role in normal behavior and during multiple pathological conditions. In this manuscript, we expose major biases and distortions which arise from the quantification of neuronal spike train oscillations. These, previously neglected, biases hinder the comparison of oscillations across brain regions, neuronal types and behavioral states, leading inevitably to severe misinterpretation of experimental results. We demonstrate the biases computationally, formulate them analytically and validate their appearance and magnitude in an experimental dataset recorded from Parkinsonian non-human primates. Next, following a formulation of the distortions, we introduce a novel objective measure, the "modulation index", which overcomes these biases, and enables a reliable detection of oscillations from spike trains and a direct estimation of the oscillation magnitude. The modulation index is validated on the same experimental data demonstrating the unbiased detection of beta oscillation in the globus pallidus during Parkinsonism. The manuscript provides a solid infrastructure for oscillation analysis which benefits multiple neuroscience fields ranging from basic science to clinical studies, moreover its results may be expanded to encompass additional fields in biology which require the spectral analysis of point process data.
