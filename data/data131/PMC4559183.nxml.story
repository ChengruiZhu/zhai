The effect of vitamin E intake on spatial learning and working memory performances of young rats has been investigated in the Morris water maze and locomotor activity has been assessed by an open-field test. A total of 45 young male Wistar albino rats aged two months were divided into three equal groups: control, olive oil, and vitamin E groups. These groups were treated for 30 days with a once daily intraperitoneal injection. The rats were then tested for their ability to find the location of the platform (spatial learning). The results revealed that there was no statistically significant difference between the time spent to find the platform and the time spent in half area of the tank, including the platform among the group, while the time spent to find the platform was found to have increased from the first day to the fourth day in all the groups. In the open-field test, the locomotor activity quite significantly increased in the peripheral area in the olive oil group. The supplementation with vitamin E for a short period had not improved the learning performance of the healthy young rats. It was concluded that the beneficial effect of vitamin E intake on learning is related to the beginning time and the duration of vitamin E intake.
