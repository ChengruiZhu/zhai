Information retrieval from biomedical repositories has become a challenging task because of their increasing size and complexity. To facilitate the research aimed at improving the search for relevant documents, various information retrieval challenges have been launched. In this article, we present the improved medical information retrieval systems designed by Poznan University of Technology and Poznan University of Medical Sciences as a contribution to the bioCADDIE 2016 challengeâ€”a task focusing on information retrieval from a collection of 794 992 datasets generated from 20 biomedical repositories. The system developed by our team utilizes the Terrier 4.2 search platform enhanced by a query expansion method using word embeddings. This approach, after post-challenge modifications and improvements (with particular regard to assigning proper weights for original and expanded terms), allowed us achieving the second best infNDCG measure (0.4539) compared with the challenge results and infAP 0.3978. This demonstrates that proper utilization of word embeddings can be a valuable addition to the information retrieval process. Some analysis is provided on related work involving other bioCADDIE contributions. We discuss the possibility of improving our results by using better word embedding schemes to find candidates for query expansion.
