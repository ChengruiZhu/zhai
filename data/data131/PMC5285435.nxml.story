 statistical tests or Fisher’s exact test. A Cox proportional hazards model was used to assess the correlations between miRNAs and overall survival (OS). Forest plots were performed to evaluate the prognostic impact of the miRNAs examined in the present study in the Asian population. The expression levels of miR-21, miR-31, miR-93 and miR-375 were different when Zn levels were varied in EC cell lines, but only miR-21 and miR-375 were associated with patient characteristics and prognosis in patients with EC from an area of China with a high incidence of EC. The patients expressing high levels of miR-21 had poor OS (HR 2.15, 95% CI 1.16–3.97), whereas those with high levels of miR-375 had improved OS (HR 0.47, 95% CI 0.26–0.87).The patients with both a high level of miR-375 and a low level of miR-21 had significantly better outcomes. Forest plots based on an analysis of this Asian population indicated that a high level of miR-21 significantly predicted a shortened OS (HR 1.83, 95% CI 1.42–2.37), whereas a high level of miR-375 was significantly correlated with increased survival (HR 0.56, 95% CI 0.43–0.73). MiR-21 and miR-375 could be used as prognostic biomarkers in areas with a high incidence of EC, and combining these markers may results in a better effect.
