) by a modified Callan-Tomlin technique. Such preparations were examined with the electron microscope, and the negative staining appearance of the annulate lamellae is described. The annulate lamellae can be detected either adhering to the nuclear envelope or being detached from it. Sometimes they are observed to be connected with slender tubular-like structures interpreted as parts of the endoplasmic reticulum. The results obtained from negative staining are combined with those from sections. Especially, the structural data on the annulate lamellae and the nuclear envelope of the very same cell were compared. Evidence is presented that in the oocytes studied the two kinds of porous cisternae, namely annulate lamellae and nuclear envelope, are markedly distinguished in that the annulate lamellae exhibit a much higher pore frequency (generally about twice that found for the corresponding nuclear envelope) and have also a relative pore area occupying as much as 32% to 55% of the cisternal surface (compared with 13% to 22% in the nuclear envelopes). The pore diameter and all other ultrastructural details of the pore complexes, however, are equivalent in both kinds of porous cisternae. Like the annuli of the nuclear pore complexes of various animal and plant cells, the annuli of the annulate lamellae pores reveal also an eightfold symmetry of their subunits in negatively stained as well as in sectioned material. Furthermore, the annulate lamellae are shown to be a site of activity of the Mg-Na-K-stimulated ATPase.
