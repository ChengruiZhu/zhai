The small fields and sharp gradients typically encountered in proton radiosurgery require high spatial resolution dosimetric measurements, especially below 1–2 cm diameters. Radiochromic film provides high resolution, but requires postprocessing and special handling. Promising alternatives are diode detectors with small sensitive volumes (SV) that are capable of high resolution and real‐time dose acquisition. In this study we evaluated the PTW PR60020 proton dosimetry diode using radiation fields and beam energies relevant to radiosurgery applications. Energies of 127 and 157 MeV (9.7 to 15 cm range) and initial diameters of 8, 10, 12, and 20 mm were delivered using single‐stage scattering and four modulations (0, 15, 30, and 60 mm) to a water tank in our treatment room. Depth dose and beam profile data were compared with PTW Markus N23343 ionization chamber, EBT2 Gafchromic film, and Monte Carlo simulations. Transverse dose profiles were measured using the diode in "edge‐on" orientation or EBT2 film. Diode response was linear with respect to dose, uniform with dose rate, and showed an orientation‐dependent (i.e., beam parallel to, or perpendicular to, detector axis) response of less than 1%. Diode vs. Markus depth‐dose profiles, as well as Markus relative dose ratio vs. simulated dose‐weighted average lineal energy plots, suggest that any LET‐dependent diode response is negligible from particle entrance up to the very distal portion of the SOBP for the energies tested. Finally, while not possible with the ionization chamber due to partial volume effects, accurate diode depth‐dose measurements of 8, 10, and 12 mm diameter beams were obtained compared to Monte Carlo simulations. Because of the small SV that allows measurements without partial volume effects and the capability of submillimeter resolution (in edge‐on orientation) that is crucial for small fields and high‐dose gradients (e.g., penumbra, distal edge), as well as negligible LET dependence over nearly the full the SOBP, the PTW proton diode proved to be a useful high‐resolution, real‐time metrology device for small proton field radiation measurements such as would be encountered in radiosurgery applications.
