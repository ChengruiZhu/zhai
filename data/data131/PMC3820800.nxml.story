Mutation rates are correlated with the level of gene expression in budding yeast, demonstrating a link between transcription and stability of the underlying DNA template. In the current work, we describe a novel type of transcription-associated mutation that converts imperfect inverted repeats (quasi-palindromes or QPs) to perfect inverted repeats. Using appropriate mutation reporters, we demonstrate that QP mutations are strongly affected by the direction of DNA replication and have distinctive genetic requirements. Most notably, rates of transcription-associated QP events are regulated by the RNase H class of enzymes, which are specialized to process the RNA component of RNA∶DNA hybrids. The source of the RNA∶DNA hybrids that initiate QP mutations is unclear, but could reflect transcripts that remain stably base-paired with the DNA template, or aberrant processing of the RNA primers normally used to initiate DNA synthesis. These studies further expand the diverse ways that transcription affects the mutation landscape, and establish a novel way that RNA∶DNA hybrids can contribute to genetic instability. The high conservation of basic DNA-related metabolic processes suggests that results in yeast will be broadly applicable in higher eukaryotes.
