An elderly female patient presented to surgical outpatient clinic with complaint of gradual onset of painless submental and sublingual midline swellings for 6 months of duration. The swellings were noncompressible, nontranslucent, nonpulsatile, and nontender on palpation. Clinical diagnosis was plunging ranula or dermoid cysts. Ultrasound examination of sublingual swelling showed cystic lesion with particulate content. Submental swelling showed cystic swelling with few echogenic floating lobules inside suggesting possibility of epidermoid/dermoid cyst. Magnetic resonance imaging of the face showed homogeneous fluid content within the sublingual cystic lesion and heterogeneous fluid content with few floating nodules within submental swelling. Both cystic lesions were noncommunicative and were showing diffusion restriction and no fat signal. Radiological diagnosis was sublingual and submental epidermoid cysts. She was operated under general anesthesia, and two separate cystic masses were excised with intact capsule. Histopathological diagnosis of masses confirms epidermoid cyst. Several literature have reported isolated sublingual or submandibular epidermoid cyst. However, concurrent sublingual and submental epidermoid cysts with different imaging appearance are rarely reported.
