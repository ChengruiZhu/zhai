Friedreich's ataxia is an inherited disease that causes progressive damage to the nervous system and affects the muscles and heart. The disease is caused by a defect in the frataxin gene, which is involved in iron homeostasis and likely protects against reactive oxygen species. In order to identify mechanisms involved in the nature and progression of the disease, we performed transcriptional profiling and measurements of mitochondrial and nuclear DNA damage on blood cells from FRDA patients. Transcriptional profiling was performed on blood samples from a cohort of 28 children compared to a control group. These data were then validated with a cohort of 14 adults with FRDA compared to a second independent control group. DNA damage was assessed on the blood samples from the 28 FRDA children, plus an additional 19 affected children, by quantitative PCR (QPCR). Transcriptional profiling revealed changes in gene expression consistent with the presence of genotoxic stress in FRDA patients. This finding was supported by the direct evidence that FRDA patients accumulated significantly higher levels of mitochondrial and nuclear DNA damage as compared to controls. The identification of potential biomarkers, including the DNA damage found in peripheral blood, may help identify therapeutic approaches for this devastating disease.
