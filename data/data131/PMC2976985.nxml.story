Nonclinical dose formulation analysis methods are used to confirm test article concentration and homogeneity in formulations and determine formulation stability in support of regulated nonclinical studies. There is currently no regulatory guidance for nonclinical dose formulation analysis method validation or sample analysis. Regulatory guidance for the validation of analytical procedures has been developed for drug product/formulation testing; however, verification of the formulation concentrations falls under the framework of GLP regulations (not GMP). The only current related regulatory guidance is the bioanalytical guidance for method validation. The fundamental parameters for bioanalysis and formulation analysis validations that overlap include: recovery, accuracy, precision, specificity, selectivity, carryover, sensitivity, and stability. Divergence in bioanalytical and drug product validations typically center around the acceptance criteria used. As the dose formulation samples are not true “unknowns”, the concept of quality control samples that cover the entire range of the standard curve serving as the indication for the confidence in the data generated from the “unknown” study samples may not always be necessary. Also, the standard bioanalytical acceptance criteria may not be directly applicable, especially when the determined concentration does not match the target concentration. This paper attempts to reconcile the different practices being performed in the community and to provide recommendations of best practices and proposed acceptance criteria for nonclinical dose formulation method validation and sample analysis.
