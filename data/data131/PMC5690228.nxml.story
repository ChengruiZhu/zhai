 were considered as standard. In the indirect dosimetry approach, exposure parameters such as kVp, mAs, focal film distance (FFD), and tube outputs recorded during data acquisition were used for calculating incident air kerma on the patient's skin, entrance surface air kerma (ESAK) that is recommended by the IAEA as the most appropriate patient dosimetry quantity in simple radiographic examinations. This survey reveals significant variations in the radiological practice. Results showed that the parameters set by radiologic technologists change in a wide range: mAs varied from 2 to 80 for skull PA, 2 to 202 for chest LAT, and FFD varied from 50 to 180 for skull LAT projection. The study showed that patient doses in three chest projections exceed the IAEA and European Commission dose reference levels (EC DRLs) — 1.0, 1.12, and 2.20 mGy for chest PA, chest AP, and chest LAT, respectively. Results also showed that mean ESAKs of patients in skull projections were generally lower than the IAEA and EC DRLs, 1.5, 1.72, and 2.25 for skull LAT, skull AP, and skull PA, respectively. This study provides evidence that dose reduction in the simple X‐ray examinations is feasible by updating clinical audits and implementation of systematic quality assurance (QA) and quality control (QC) programs. The authors recommend that DRLs obtained in this study can be used as local DRLs in Khuzestan area and dose surveys must be performed in all provinces to establish national dose reference levels (NDRLs) in Iran.
