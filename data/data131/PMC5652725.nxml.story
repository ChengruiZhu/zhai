A critical problem in leukemia as well as other cancer therapies is the development of chemotherapeutic drug-resistance. We have developed models of hematopoietic drug resistance that are based on expression of dominant-negative TP53 [TP53 (DN)] or constitutively-active MEK1 [MEK1(CA)] oncogenes in the presence of chemotherapeutic drugs. In human cancer, functional TP53 activity is often lost in human cancers. Also, activation of the Raf/MEK/ERK pathway frequently occurs due to mutations/amplification of upstream components of this and other interacting pathways. FL5.12 is an interleukin-3 (ILâˆ’3) dependent hematopoietic cell line that is sensitive to doxorubicin (a.k.a Adriamycin). FL/Doxo is a derivative cell line that was isolated by culturing the parental FL5.12 cells in doxorubicin for prolonged periods of time. FL/Doxo + TP53 (DN) and FL/Doxo + MEK1 (CA) are FL/Doxo derivate cell lines that were infected with retrovirus encoding TP53 (DN) or MEK1 (CA) and are more resistant to doxorubicin than FL/Doxo cells. This panel of cell lines displayed differences in the sensitivity to inhibitors that suppress mTORC1, BCL2/BCLXL, MEK1 or MDM2 activities, as well as, the proteasomal inhibitor MG132. The expression of key genes involved in cell growth and drug-resistance (e.g., MDM2, MDR1, BAX) also varied in these cells. Thus, we can begin to understand some of the key genes that are involved in the resistance of hematopoietic cells to chemotherapeutic drugs and targeted therapeutics.
