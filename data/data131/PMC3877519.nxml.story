The present work was performed to develop and evaluate transdermal patches of combined antiasthmatic drugs (salbutamol sulphate and ketotifen fumarate). Polyvinyl alcohol membrane was used as backing membrane and eudragit RL-100 was used as matrix material to suspend the drugs in the continuous thickness of the patch. Methanol was solvent and propylene glycol was used as plasticizer. Tween 20, isopropyl myristate, eucalyptus oil, castor oil and span-20 were used as permeability enhancers. Thickness, weight variation and drug uniformity were investigated. The patch formulations were also subjected to drug release in dissolution media and permeation through rabbit skin. Effects of different enhancers were evaluated on release and permeation of drugs. F3 formulations having isopropyl myristate as permeation enhancer, showed maximum amounts of drugs release (88.11% of salbutamol sulphate and 88.33% of ketotifen fumarate) at the end of 24 h dissolution study. F3 also showed maximum permeation of both drugs (4.235 mg salbutamol sulphate and 1.057 mg ketotifen fumarate) after 24 h permeation study through rabbit skin mounted in Franz cell. The patches having no enhancer in the formulation also showed some drug release and permeation due to the presence of plasticizer. The results of the study suggested that new controlled release transdermal formulations of combined antiasthmatic drugs can be suitably developed as an alternate to conventional dosage forms.
