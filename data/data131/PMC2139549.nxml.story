 An explanation was sought for the fact that delayed-type hypersensitivity (DTH) does not normally occur in response to T-cell-dependent antigens unless an adjuvant is used. But when sheep red blood cells (SRBC) were administered intravenously DTH did appear, provided that the dose of antigen was less than that required to give a maximum antibody response. Animals in which T-cell activity had been blocked by a large dose of antigen could not be sensitized adoptively, and their spleen cells failed to transfer DTH to normal recipients. The serum of blocked animals partially inhibited the induction of DTH, and after absorption with SRBC its blocking activity increased substantially. Moreover, absorbed serum inhibited DTH in previously sensitized animals, but it did not inhibit the proliferative response to SRBC in peripheral lymph nodes or reduce the number of plaque-forming cells produced therein. On the contrary, the hemagglutinating titer was actually increased by blocking serum even though DTH was totally suppressed. It is concluded that a product of the interaction between antigens and antibody blocks the activated T cells which mediate DTH without interfering with helper cells.
