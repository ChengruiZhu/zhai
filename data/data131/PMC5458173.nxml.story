Before reaching a peripheral vein (PV), miRNAs released by the tumor are diluted and dispersed throughout the body or even retained in a specific organ. We hypothesized that blood drawn from the tumor-draining vein could provide more homogeneous information than blood drawn from the PV as that blood would contain all the biomarkers released by the tumor before they reach a potential metastatic site. We have profiled 754 miRNAs in 15 colon cancer plasma samples from the tumor-draining vein, the mesenteric vein (MV), identifying 13 microRNAs associated with relapse. The prognostic impact of these miRNAs were validated in 50 MV and 50 paired PV plasma samples of stage I-III colon cancer patients. Four miRNAs, let-7g, miR-15b, miR-155 and miR-328, were found overexpressed in MV compared to PV, and patients with high levels of those miRNAs in MV plasma had shorter time to relapse. Interestingly, in patients developing liver metastases, the exosomal cargo of miR-328 was much greater in MV than in PV plasma indicating a possible role of miR-328 in the development of liver metastases. Our results indicate that in colon cancer, the primary tumor releases high concentrations of miRNAs through the MV, and some of them are contained in tumor derived exosomes.
