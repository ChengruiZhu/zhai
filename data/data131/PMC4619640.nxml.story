Single cell studies have shown that differential patterns in the dynamics of signaling proteins, transcription factor activity, gene expression, etc. produce distinct downstream outcomes. The opposite also holds true where particular cellular outcomes have been found to be associated with the dynamical pattern of one or more signaling molecules. Signaling pathways, therefore, serve as signal processing units to inform specific downstream regulation. However, the functional capabilities of the dynamic aspects of signaling are not well understood. To address this issue, we developed a new approach that evaluates information processing between dynamic features in signaling patterns and transcriptional regulatory activity. Our work demonstrates that the information transfer occur through decoding of temporal history of signals rather than only through instantaneous correlations. Moreover, our results identify regulatory network motifs as the critical components in the information processing and filtering of variability in signaling dynamics to produce distinct patterns of downstream transcriptional responses. Our methodology can be broadly applied to single cell scale data on experimentally accessible downstream measures to infer dynamic aspects of upstream signaling.
