Valproic acid is a broad-spectrum anticonvulsant that has also gained attention in the psychiatric setting. With respect to safety, valproic acid may induce a seemingly rare condition, hyperammonemia, which can induce a wide variety of symptoms ranging from irritability to coma. The proposed mechanism of hyperammonemia involves depletion of carnitine and overproduction of a toxic metabolite, 4-en-valproic acid, both of which impair the urea cycle and thus ammonia elimination. Carnitine is a commonly used antidote for acute intoxication of valproic acid, but is not a therapeutic option for management of chronic adults with adverse effects related to valproic acid. We herein report a case involving a woman with epilepsy who developed hyperammonemia after a change in her anticonvulsant therapy. She reported increased seizures and gastrointestinal disturbances. Her ammonia, valproic acid, 4-en-valproic acid, and carnitine levels were monitored. Her ammonia level was elevated and her carnitine level was at the inferior limit of the population range. She was supplemented with carnitine at 1â€‰g/day. After 1 month, her ammonia level decreased, her carnitine level increased, and her seizures were better controlled. Carnitine supplementation was useful for reversal of her hyperammonemia, allowing her to continue valproic acid for seizure control.
