It is known that fusion of influenza virus to host cell membranes is strongly promoted by acidic pH. We have determined conditions required to obtain pH-dependent fusion of influenza virus to planar bilayer membranes. The rate of viral fusion was determined from the flash rate of R18-labeled virions delivered to the surface of the planar membrane by pressure-ejection from a pipette. For a bilayer formed only of phospholipids and cholesterol, the fusion rate was independent of pH and unaffected by the phospholipid composition. When the gangliosides GD1a + GT1b were included in the planar membrane, however, the fusion rate varied steeply with pH. The rate at pH 7.4 in the presence of the gangliosides was about an order of magnitude less than in their absence. At pH less than approximately 5.5, the rate was about an order of magnitude greater in the presence of gangliosides than in their absence. The fusion rate with planar membranes containing globoside, a ceramide-backboned glycolipid, was also independent of pH, indicating that the pH dependence required sialic acid on the carbohydrate moiety of the glycolipid. The gangliosides GM1a and GM3, both of which possess sialic acid, produced the same pH-dependent fusion rate as seen with GD1a + GT1b, indicating that the presence, but not the location, of terminal sialic acids is critical. Incubating virus with soluble sialyllactose blocked fusion to both ganglioside-free and ganglioside- containing planar membranes. These results show that the pH dependence of influenza virion fusion arises from the interaction of the sialic acid receptor with the influenza hemagglutinin. A model for sialic acid- hemagglutinin interactions accounting for pH-dependent fusion is presented.
