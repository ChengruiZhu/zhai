The 2009 H1N1pdm influenza pandemic spread rapidly but heterogeneously. A notable pattern occurred in Europe, with the UK exhibiting a first wave in early summer and a second wave in autumn, while all other European countries experienced a single wave in autumn/winter, resulting in a clear West to East pattern of spread. Our study asks which factors were most responsible for this variation, and to what extent the pattern of spread was predictable from data available in the first two months of the pandemic. Providing reliable answers to these questions would reduce uncertainty and improve situational awareness for policy-makers in the future, giving clearer expectations as to the likely impact and timing of a future pandemic and the potential effectiveness of mitigation measures. We found that that heterogeneity seen in 2009 can largely be explained by marked differences in school calendars, human mobility and demography across Europe. We also conclude that much of the variation in timing of the pandemic in Europe would have been predictable on the basis of data available in early June 2009. Our work supports the use of models accounting for the structure of complex modern societies for giving insight to policy makers in future pandemics.
