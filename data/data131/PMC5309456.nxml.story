 removal; day 11 AI). Follicular fluid stradiol (E2) and progesterone (P4) in acyclic and pre-ovulatory follicle in study groups was significantly (P<0.01) higher than peripheral level. Peripheral E2 concentration, during pre-ovulatory period in group II was higher (P<0.05) than group I. Significant correlation between serum and follicular E2 was deduced (r=0.888; P<0.01) as significant difference in serum cholesterol content was shown between groups. Lower follicular total protein (P<0.05) in acyclic animals and higher follicular glucose (P<0.05) in treated group were concluded. Significant correlation (r=-0.770; P<0.05) was observed between follicular cholesterol and triglycerides. Follicular characteristics, post PMSG administration, differed significantly (0.83 ± 0.20 vs 1.32 ± 0.12; P<0.01) in all buffaloes exhibiting estrus, out of which four conceived. In conclusion, follicular hormonal and biochemical profile exhibits alteration in protein and glucose level between summer acyclic and treated buffaloes. However, peripheral E2 along with fertility response showed significant difference (P<0.01) between the study groups with significant correlation in E2, cholesterol and triglycerides between peripheral and follicular compartment.
