Proteins are flexible nanomachines that frequently accomplish their biological function by collective atomic motions. Such motions may be characterized by hinge, shear, or rotational motions of entire protein domains, loop movements, or subtle rearrangements of amino acid side chains. In many cases it is far from obvious how collective motions are related to a particular biological task. Therefore, we propose a novel technique termed “functional mode analysis” that, based on an ensemble of structures, aims to detect a collective motion that is directly related to a particular protein function. From the given set of protein structures, together with a “functional quantity”, the technique seeks the collective motion that is maximally correlated to the functional quantity. The chosen functional quantity can be quite general; typical examples could include the openness of a channel, active site geometry, or cleft solvent accessibility. Because the proposed framework is highly general, we expect the approach to be useful to a wide range of applications. To illustrate the new technique, we apply functional mode analysis to molecular dynamics trajectories of a polyalanine-helix, bacteriophage T4 lysozyme, Trp-cage, and Leucine-binding protein.
