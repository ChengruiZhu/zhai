Single frog skeletal muscle fibers were attached to a servo motor and force transducer by knotting the tendons to pieces of wire at the fiber insertions. Small amplitude, high frequency sinusoidal length changes were then applied during tetani while fibers contracted both isometrically and isotonically at various constant velocities. The amplitude of the resulting force oscillation provides a relative measure of muscle stiffness. It is shown from an analysis of the transient force responses observed after sudden changes in muscle length applied both at full and reduced overlap and during the rising phase of short tetani that these responses can be explained on the basis of varying numbers of cross bridges attached at the time of the length step. Therefore, the stiffness measured by the high frequency length oscillation method is taken to be directly proportional to the number of cross bridges attached to thin filament sites. It is found that muscle stiffness measured in this way falls with increasing shortening velocity, but not as rapidly as the force. The results suggest that at the maximum velocity of shortening, when the external force is zero, muscle stiffness is still substantial. The findings are interpreted in terms of a specific model for muscle contraction in which the maximum velocity of shortening under zero external load arises when a force balance is attained between attached cross bridges some of which are aiding and others opposing shortening. Other interpretations of these results are also discussed.
