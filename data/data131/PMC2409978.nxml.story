This work focuses on the L68Q mutation in the cystatin C gene which causes hereditary cystatin C amyloid angiopathy (HCCAA), an autosomal dominant disease with high penetrance in contemporary Icelanders, manifest by lethal brain hemorrhages in young normotensive adults. On the basis of both DNA haplotype and genealogical analyses, we determined that all known copies of the L68Q mutation derive from a common ancestor born roughly 18 generations ago, around 1550. Furthermore, we were able to show a rapid change in its penetrance for obligate carriers born from 1825 to 1900, demonstrated by a drastic reduction in life span, from 65 years to the present-day average of 30 years. The detrimental phenotypic impact of the L68Q mutation appears to have emerged in reaction to common life-style changes almost three centuries after the mutation occurred. We believe that this is the first report of phenotypic flexibility of a monogenic disease in reaction to life-style changes that fall within the normal range of behavior of a single population in the space of a few generations. Our results underline how single gene disorders with simple Mendelian inheritance can be affected by environmental factors, resulting in changed disease status.
