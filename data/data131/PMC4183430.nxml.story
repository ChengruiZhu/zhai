One of the most fundamental tradeoffs in evolutionary biology is between survival and reproduction. Many parasites experience distinct selective pressures during different stages of their life cycles; mutations arising during one stage may be beneficial, but come at a cost during another. For example, many viruses experience favorable growth conditions within a host punctuated with harsh conditions outside the host during transmission. We conducted an evolution experiment with a ssDNA microvirid bacteriophage selecting for growth within the host and capsid stability outside the host in the presence of extreme environmental conditions (low pH or high temperature), and we hypothesized detection of a tradeoff between reproduction and survival. We found that individual mutations gained under rapidly fluctuating selective pressures similar to those experienced by pathogens increased both growth rate and capsid stability; tradeoffs were completely absent. We compared the effects of beneficial mutations gained in response to selection for growth rate alone and found the expected tradeoffs on capsid stability. Tradeoffs therefore arise when selection is not working to avoid them. Otherwise, payoffs prevail.
