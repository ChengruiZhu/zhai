Non-syndromic orofacial clefts (NSOFC), which include cleft lip and palate (CLP), cleft lip only (CLO), and cleft palate only (CPO), contains a range of disorders affecting the lips and oral cavity. No systematic review and meta-analysis has been carried out to synthesize the prevalence of NSOFC in Chinese perinatal infants. We aimed to quantify and understand the variation of prevalence national and regional levels. Four English databases and four Chinese databases were searched using a comprehensive search strategy from inception to April 2017. The random effect model was used for this meta-analysis. To determine the sources of heterogeneity, subgroup analyses and meta-regression were conducted based on different categories. The protocol has been pre-registered in the PROSPERO, number CRD42017062293. 110 studies, including 15,094,978 Chinese perinatal infants, were eligible for inclusion. The pooled prevalence rate for NSOFC was 1.67‰ (95% CI 1.53–1.82), varying with provinces. The pooled prevalence estimate was 0.56‰ (0.50–0.63) for CLO, 0.82‰ (0.73–0.90) for CLP, and 0.27‰ (0.24–0.30) for CPO. Significant associations were found between overall prevalence estimates and survey year and study region. The prevalence of NSOFC was severe in Chinese perinatal infants, varying with provinces. The results will serve as a baseline for future assessment of the overall effectiveness of NSOFC control, and will also support and inform health policy for planning and helping health debates.
