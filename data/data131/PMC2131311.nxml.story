., when the bronchus to one lung is blocked and its vagus nerve is severed, the pulmonary ventilation recorded by the opposite lung exhibits the same changes as may result from unilateral vagotomy alone, unaccompanied by occlusion of the bronchus. 4. From these facts it may be concluded that the slowing and deepening of breathing which follows unilateral vagotomy does not depend for its occurrence upon the passage of air in and out of the bronchus of the lung whose vagus nerve has been sectioned. 5. The slowing of respirations after occlusion of the bronchus to one lung and section of the corresponding vagus nerve still occurs even though the phrenic nerve on the same side has been divided. This indicates that the slowing of respirations following unilateral vagotomy does not depend on the movements of the diaphragm on the side of vagal section. 6. When the pulmonary artery to one lung has been ligated and the vagus nerve on the same side cut, the response of the other lung is the same as has been described, namely, its respiratory movements become slower and deeper. This is taken as evidence that the results of unilateral vagotomy are not dependent upon an intact pulmonary circulation. 7. The general conclusions from these experiments are that the slowing and deepening of respirations following unilateral vagotomy do not depend upon: (
