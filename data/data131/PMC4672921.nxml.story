Using microarray analysis (a technique that measures the RNA levels of thousands of different genes) to compare the RNA molecules present in the blood in a discovery cohort of 74 patients with sepsis and 31 post-surgical patients with infection-negative systemic inflammation, the researchers identified a molecular classifier (SeptiCyte Lab) consisting of four RNA biomarkers. They validated this classifier using five additional patient cohorts, RT-qPCR (a technique that measures the amounts of specific RNAs in biological samples), and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis (a graphical method for determining diagnostic test performance). The overall AUC for the test in the five validation cohorts was 0.88. The AUC (area under a ROC curve) quantifies the ability of a test to discriminate between individuals with and without a disease. A perfect test that yields no false positives or false negatives has an AUC of 1.00; a test no better at identifying true positives than flipping a coin has an AUC of 0.5. Importantly, disease severity did not affect the performance of SeptiCyte Lab, and the assay was better at discriminating sepsis from infection-negative systemic inflammation than all tested clinical and laboratory parameters (singly and in combination) that can currently be obtained within 24 hours of admission to an intensive care unit.
