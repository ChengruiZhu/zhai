Dual oxidase 1 (DUOX1) is an oxidant-generating enzyme within the airway epithelium that participates in innate airway host defense and epithelial homeostasis. Recent studies indicate that DUOX1 is suppressed in lung cancers by epigenetic silencing, although the importance of DUOX1 silencing in lung cancer development or progression is unknown. Here we show that loss of DUOX1 expression in a panel of lung cancer cell lines is strongly associated with loss of the epithelial marker E-cadherin. Moreover, RNAi-mediated DUOX1 silencing in lung epithelial cells and the cancer cell line NCI-H292 was found to result in loss of epithelial characteristics/molecular features (altered morphology, reduced barrier function and loss of E-cadherin) and increased mesenchymal features (increased migration, anchorage-independent growth and gain of vimentin/collagen), suggesting a direct contribution of DUOX1 silencing to epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT), an important feature of metastatic cancer. Conversely, overexpression of DUOX1 in A549 cells was capable of reversing EMT features. DUOX1 silencing in H292 cells also led to enhanced resistance to epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors such as erlotinib, and enhanced levels of cancer stem cell (CSC) markers CD133 and ALDH1. Furthermore, acquired resistance of H292 cells to erlotinib resulted in enhanced EMT and CSC features, as well as loss of DUOX1. Finally, compared with control H292 cells, H292-shDUOX1 cells displayed enhanced invasive features
