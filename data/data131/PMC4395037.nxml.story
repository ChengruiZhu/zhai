Hemangiomas are the most common primary hepatic tumors, but there are few reports of their occurrence elsewhere in the abdomen. The concurrent existence of multiple fibrous nodules of the omentum, mesentery, and porta hepatis, along with a gastric hemangioma, in a child raises the question of syndromic association. Our search of the English literature revealed only rare mentions of hemangiomas involving the stomach and mesentery or omentum. These lesions have attracted clinical attention by symptoms of obstruction, gastrointestinal bleeding, intussusception, infection, perforation, or vague abdominal pain. Although some tumors exist unnoticed for many decades and are identified only incidentally, others present emergently and require immediate surgical attention. We report the case of a 14-year-old boy who presented with symptoms similar to those for appendicitis or duplication cyst, who was found to have a torsed gastric hemangioma and multiple benign fibrous nodules in the abdomen. The presence of multiple vascular or fibrous lesions is associated with genetic syndromes that can have lifelong and reproductive repercussions; so it is imperative that these tumors be recognized by diagnosticians.
