Numerous choice tasks have been used to study decision processes. Some of these choice tasks, specifically n-armed bandit, information sampling and foraging tasks, pose choices that trade-off immediate and future reward. Specifically, the best choice may not be the choice that pays off the highest reward immediately, and exploration of unknown options vs. exploiting known options can be a normatively useful strategy. We characterized the optimal choice strategies across these tasks using Markov Decision Processes (MDPs). The MDP framework can characterize optimal choice strategies when choices are affected by the value of future rewards. We found that uncertainty and time horizon have important effects on the choice strategies in these tasks. Specifically, in bandit and information sampling tasks, increasing uncertainty increases the value of exploring choice options that tend to pay off in the future, while decreasing uncertainty increases the value of choice options that pay off immediately. These effects are increased when time horizons are longer. Foraging tasks differ in that uncertainty plays a minimal role. However, time horizon is still important in foraging. Specifically, for long time horizons, travel delays to rewards become less relevant.
