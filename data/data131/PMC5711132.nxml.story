Small‐animal single‐photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) system plays an important role in the field of drug development and investigation of potential drugs in the preclinical phase. The small‐animal High‐Resolution SPECT (HiReSPECT) scanner has been recently designed and developed based on compact and high‐resolution detectors. The detectors are based on a high‐resolution parallel hole collimator, a cesium iodide (sodium‐activated) pixelated crystal array and two H8500 position‐sensitive photomultiplier tubes. In this system, a full set of data corrections such as energy, linearity, and uniformity, together with resolution recovery option in reconstruction algorithms, are available. In this study, we assessed the performance of the system based on NEMA‐NU1–2007 standards for pixelated detector cameras. Characterization of the HiReSPECT was performed by measurement of the physical parameters including planar and tomographic performance. The planar performance of the system was characterized with flood‐field phantom for energy resolution and uniformity. Spatial resolution and sensitivity were evaluated as functions of distance with capillary tube and cylindrical source, respectively. Tomographic spatial resolution was characterized as a function of radius of rotation (ROR). A dedicated hot rod phantom and image quality phantom was used for the evaluation of overall tomographic quality of the HiReSPECT. The results showed that the planar spatial resolution was
