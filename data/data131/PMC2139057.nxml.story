 Cutaneous basophil hypersensitivity (CBH) was studied for tolerogenic requirements. Graded doses of intravenous ovalbumin (OA) were given to guinea pigs which were subsequently immunized appropriately to produce CBH, classic delayed hypersensitivity (classic DH), and/or antibodies of both passive cutaneous anaphylaxis (PCA) and hemolytic types. Results showed that doses of intravenous antigen sufficient to induce subsequent tolerance for classic DH and hemolytic antibody actually stimulate CBH reactivity and PCA antibody production. Other studies of dose-route relationships for CBH production demonstrated that optimal immunogenic dosage requirements for CBH varied widely with route of antigen employed. OA in incomplete Freund's adjuvant (IFA) injected into footpads had low dosage requirements, intravenous OA had high dose requirements, and intradermal soluble OA dosage requirements were intermediate. The observation that blatant immunogenic responses occur during the early period of tolerance induction amplifies the significant heterogeneity of the cellular immune response and may be of importance in understanding tolerogenesis. Similar immunogenic-tolerogenic requirements and the prime role played by the basophil suggest a developmental or functional relationship between CBH and PCA antibody response.
