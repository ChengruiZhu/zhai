Dosage-dependent upregulation of most of chromosome 21 (Hsa21) genes has been demonstrated in heart tissues of fetuses with Down syndrome (DS). Also miRNAs might play important roles in the cardiac phenotype as they are highly expressed in the heart and regulate cardiac development. Five Hsa21 miRNAs have been well studied in the past: miR-99a-5p, miR-125b-2-5p, let-7c-5p, miR-155-5p, and miR-802-5p but few information is available about their expression in trisomic tissues. In this study, we evaluated the expression of these miRNAs in heart tissues from DS fetuses, showing that miR-99a-5p, miR-155-5p, and let-7c-5p were overexpressed in trisomic hearts. To investigate their role, predicted targets were obtained from different databases and cross-validated using the gene expression profiling dataset we previously generated for fetal hearts. Eighty-five targets of let-7c-5p, 33 of miR-155-5p, and 10 of miR-99a-5p were expressed in fetal heart and downregulated in trisomic hearts. As nuclear encoded mitochondrial genes were found downregulated in trisomic hearts and mitochondrial dysfunction is a hallmark of DS phenotypes, we put special attention to let-7c-5p and miR-155-5p targets downregulated in DS fetal hearts and involved in mitochondrial function. The let-7c-5p predicted target
