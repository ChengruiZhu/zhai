One neural correlate of being an expert is more brain volume—and presumably more neurons and more synapses—devoted to processing the input patterns falling within one's field of expertise. As the number of neurons in the neocortex does not increase during the learning period that begins with novice abilities and ends with expert performance, neurons must be viewed as a scarce resource whose connections are adjusted to be more responsive to inputs within the field of expertise and less responsive to input patterns outside this field. To accomplish this enhanced, but localized improvement of representational capacity, the usual theory of associative synaptic modification is extended to include synaptogenesis (formation of new synapses) and synaptic shedding (rejection of synapses by a postsynaptic neuron) in a manner compatible with the original, associative synaptic modification algorithm. Using some mathematically simplifying assumptions, a theory is developed that predicts the algorithm's eventual outcome on expert neuronal coding, and then without the simplifying assumptions, computational simulations confirm the theory’s predictions in long, but finite periods of simulation-time (i.e., finite-sampling leads to stable connections, and thus, stable expert encodings).
