Treatment of BALB/c mice with purified pig anti-(BALB/c anti-nuclease) anti-idiotypic antibodies has been found to induce the appearance of idiotype-bearing immunoglobulins (Id') in the serum of these mice in the absence of detectable antigen binding activity. This phenomenon appeared to require T cells in the hosts because no Id' was detected in the serum of nude mice similarly treated. Furthermore, the spleens of BALB/c mice treated with anti-idiotype were found to contain helper T cells capable of providing help in an in vitro plaque-forming cell response to trinitrophenyl-nuclease equivalent to that provided by helper T cells from the spleens of nuclease-primed animals. Helper T cells from both anti-idiotype-treated and nuclease-treated animals were found to be antigen-specific and to be similarly susceptible to elimination by treatment with anti-idiotype plus complement. Therefore, treatment with both antigen and anti-idiotype appeared to prime similar populations of antigen-specific helper T cells, while having different effects on the induction of antibody. These findings are consistent with the network theory of receptor interactions in the immune response, and may provide a means for studying individual cell populations involved in such interactions.
