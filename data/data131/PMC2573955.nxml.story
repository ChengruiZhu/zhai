The human genome contains many repetitive sequences. In 1991, we discovered that excessive lengthening of a three-nucleotide (trinucleotide) repeat sequence could cause a human genetic disease. We now know that this unique type of genetic mutation, known as a “repeat expansion,” occurs in at least 25 different diseases, including inherited neurological disorders such as the fragile X syndrome of mental retardation, myotonic muscular dystrophy, and Huntington's disease. An interesting feature of repeat expansion mutations is that they are genetically unstable, meaning that the repeat expansion changes in length when transmitted from parent to offspring. Thus, expanded repeats violate one major tenet of genetics—i.e., that any given sequence has a low likelihood for mutation. For expanded repeats, the likelihood of further mutation approaches 100%. Understanding why expanded repeats are so mutable has been a challenging problem for genetics research. In this study, we implicate the CTCF protein in the repeat expansion process by showing that mutation of a CTCF binding site, next to an expanded repeat sequence, increases genetic instability in mice. CTCF is an important regulatory factor that controls the expression of genes. As binding sites for CTCF are associated with many repeat sequences, CTCF may play a role in regulating genetic instability in various repeat diseases—not just the one we studied.
