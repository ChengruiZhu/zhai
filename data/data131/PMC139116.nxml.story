Thalidomide's reported ability to inhibit angiogenesis has led to clinical trials determining its effectiveness in combating various
types of cancer. This study explored thalidomide's antitumorigenic
potential when administered alone and in combination with cisplatin to
DBA2/J mice whose tumors were induced by murine erythroleukemic
cells. Thalidomide treatment alone produced no significant inhibitory
effect on tumor development and metastasis. Mice that received both
drugs had significantly lower incidences of both primary and secondary
tumors as compared to the untreated control group. Cisplatin, administered alone or in combination with thalidomide, led to a significant delay in tumor formation and a longer life span than was recorded in untreated mice. However, the combination treatment results were not significantly different from those of cisplatin treatment used as a single agent. In in vitro cell multiplication studies using murine erythroleukemic and murine endothelial cells, thalidomide failed to inhibit cell proliferation. However, cisplatin treatment with or without thalidomide, significantly inhibited the multiplication of both cell lines in a dose dependent manner.
Thalidomide does not appear to be a beneficial adjuvant to cisplatin
treatment.
