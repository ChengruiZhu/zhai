Multiple therapeutic agents have been developed to target the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) signaling pathway, which is frequently dysregulated in cancer promoting tumor growth and survival. These include pan PI3K inhibitors, which target class Ia PI3K isoforms and have largely shown limited single agent activity with narrow therapeutic windows in clinical trials. Here, we characterize SN32976, a novel pan PI3K inhibitor, for its biochemical potency against PI3K isoforms and mTOR, kinase selectivity, cellular activity, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics and antitumor efficacy relative to five clinically-evaluated pan PI3K inhibitors: buparlisib, dactolisib, pictilisib, omipalisib and ZSTK474. SN32976 potently inhibited PI3K isoforms and mTOR, displaying preferential activity for PI3Kα and sparing of PI3Kδ relative to the other inhibitors, while showing less off-target activity than the clinical inhibitors in a panel of 442 kinases. The major metabolites of SN32976 were also potent PI3K inhibitors with similar selectivity for PI3Kα as the parent compound. SN32976 compared favorably with the clinically-evaluated PI3K inhibitors in cellular assays, inhibiting pAKT expression and cell proliferation at nM concentrations, and
