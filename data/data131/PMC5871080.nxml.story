Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the common cancers worldwide, especially in developing countries. Although the chronic infections of hepatitis B and C viruses have been established as the etiological factors of HCC, the mechanism for the tumorigenesis and development of HCC is still unclear. The liver-specific microRNA-122 (miR-122), an established tumor-suppressor miRNA, is often down-regulated in HCC, while the underlying mechanism is not well understood. Here we report that the AU-rich element-binding factor AUF1 suppresses the expression of Dicer1, the type III RNase that is required for microRNA maturation, leading to the inhibited biogenesis of miR-122. Overexpression of AUF1 led to the decreased expression of Dicer1 and miR-122, while the level of the miR-122 precursor (pre-miR-122) was increased. On the other hand, siRNA of AUF1 (siAUF1) increased the levels of Dicer1 mRNA and miR-122, but it reduced the abundance of pre-miR-122. Consistent with the reported data, this study demonstrated that AUF1 and Dicer1 showed opposite expression pattern in both human HCC tissues and cell lines. In addition, AUF1 inhibited the expression of Dicer1 by interacting with the 3′ untranslated region (3′UTR) and coding region of
