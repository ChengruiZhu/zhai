Serous cystic neoplasms of the pancreas are rare exocrine pancreatic neoplasms, most of which are benign and do not communicate with the pancreatic duct. Pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasm (PanIN) is considered a precursor of ductal adenocarcinoma that is microscopically recognized in pancreatic ducts. A 67-year-old Japanese woman presented with a 10-mm multilocular cystic lesion at the pancreatic body. Magnetic resonance pancreatography showed stenosis of the main pancreatic duct at the pancreatic body and dilatation of the distal side of the main pancreatic duct. Furthermore, communication between the cystic lesion and the main pancreatic duct was suspected based on magnetic resonance pancreatography findings. Distal pancreatectomy was performed under the preoperative diagnosis of intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm. Histologically, the cystic lesion was lined with a non-atypical cuboidal or flat epithelium with clear cytoplasm and was thus diagnosed as a serous cystic neoplasm. High-grade PanIN lesions with stromal fibrosis were observed at the main and branch pancreatic ducts. Histological examination revealed no communication between the serous cystic neoplasm and the pancreatic ducts. Immunohistochemically, the epithelium of the serous cystic neoplasm showed positive anti-von Hippel-Lindau antibody staining, whereas the epithelium of the PanIN showed negative staining. A serous cystic neoplasm coexisting with another pancreatic neoplasm is rare. When dilatation of the main or branch pancreatic ducts coexists with a serous cystic neoplasm, as in this case, the lesion clinically mimics an intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm.
