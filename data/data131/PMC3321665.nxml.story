There is strong evidence that donepezil has efficacy against the three major domains of Alzheimer’s disease symptoms, namely functional ability, behavior, and cognition. The strongest evidence is for improvement or less deterioration in global outcomes and cognition in the short to medium term. There is limited evidence that improved global outcomes are maintained in the long term and clear evidence to support long-term maintenance of cognitive benefits. Also, donepezil appears to maintain function in the long term and there is some level 1 and 2 evidence of improved or limited deterioration in behavior or mood in the short to medium term. Despite donepezil’s effects on major symptoms of Alzheimer’s disease, its impact on patients’ quality of life has not been consistently demonstrated, perhaps reflecting the difficulty of assessing this aspect in this patient population. Donepezil may also lessen caregiver burden. Donepezil has some effect on markers of brain function, but more data are needed to confirm a neuroprotective effect. There is limited and conflicting evidence that long-term donepezil treatment delays time to institutionalization. There is some evidence that donepezil may be cost effective, especially when unpaid caregiver costs are considered. Donepezil is generally safe and well tolerated.
