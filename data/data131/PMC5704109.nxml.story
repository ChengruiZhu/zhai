The South African national cattle herd has increased from 6 million head since the 1970s to 14 million and more than two-thirds of the 14 million cattle in South Africa reside in the Eastern Cape Province (ECP), yet the Province has one of the highest poverty indexes. While this improvement is commendable, there are still many challenges to efficient livestock production notably infectious and non-infectious diseases. Many non-infectious diseases of the fore-stomach, such as rumenitis, rumen parakeratosis, traumatic reticuloperitonitis and poly bezoars, are rarely reported, but are known to obstruct the digestive functions of the fore-stomach, causing a marked reduction in animal weight, reproduction, feed absorption and productivity, and death. The pathogenesis of these diseases often begins with the consumption of indigestible foreign objects (IFOs). Animal husbandry in the ECP is mostly communal, with an extensive system of rearing animals as the most popular production system. This system of rearing animals exposes them to consumption of litter, especially when there is drought. This study provides knowledge on the prevalence, type and effect of the indigestible foreign object on the body condition score of animals slaughtered in the ECP.
