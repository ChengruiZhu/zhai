The Hedgehog (Hh) signaling pathway plays important roles in both embryonic development and adult tissue homeostasis. A critical step in Hh signal transduction is the inhibition of Smoothened (Smo), an atypical G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR), by the Hh receptor Patched (Ptc). It is a longstanding question how Ptc inhibits Smo and how Hh promotes Smo phosphorylation and activation. It is unlikely that Ptc inhibits Smo by direct interaction. Here, we uncover that phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate (PI(4)P), a specific phospholipid, directly interacts with Smo through an arginine motif in the Smo C-terminal tail and promotes Smo phosphorylation, activation, and ciliary localization. Ptc also interacts with PI(4)P, which is inhibited by Hh stimulation, indicating that Hh triggers the release of PI(4)P from Ptc. We further uncover that Hh stimulation induces the overall production of PI(4)P, likely by regulating PI(4)P kinase and phosphatase. Finally, in addition to the direct role in regulating Smo phosphorylation, G protein-coupled receptor kinase 2 (Gprk2) facilitates PI(4)P interaction with Smo. This study suggest that PI(4)P acts as a special small molecule shuttling between Ptc and Smo to modulate Hh responses.
