Malignant melanoma (MM) is a highly malignant skin tumor. The mechanism of MM pathogenesis and its signaling pathways are not well characterized. C-X-C chemokine receptor type 7 (CXCR7) has been reported to regulate cancer cell invasion. The present study sought to investigate the effects of CXCR7 on MM development. First, CXCR7 expression levels were assessed in the skin tumor tissue of patients with MM. Then, CXCR7 small hairpin RNA was used in M14 melanoma cells in a Transwell culture model and in a transplanted mouse model to test the effects of CXCR7. In addition, immunohistochemistry staining, reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction and western blotting were used. The results revealed that CXCR7 expression levels were significantly higher in MM tissue compared with squamous cell carcinoma or basal cell carcinoma tissue. Knocking down CXCR7 in M14 cells significantly inhibited cell migration and invasion in the Transwell culture model. Furthermore, CXCR7 knockdown also significantly reduced the transplanted tumor size, weight and vascular number in the mouse model. It was concluded that CXCR7 interacts with C-X-C motif chemokine ligand 12 to activate the chemokine receptor signaling pathway, and to increase melanoma cell migration, invasion and development.
