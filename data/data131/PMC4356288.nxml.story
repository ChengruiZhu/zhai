Primary central nervous system lymphoma (PCNSL) is a rare, highly malignant tumor type of the nervous system and is associated with poor prognosis. To investigate the efficacy of current treatment strategies for PCNSL, the present study retrospectively analyzed the clinical and pathological features, imaging results, clinical management, and prognoses of nine patients with PCNSL. Postoperative pathological examination confirmed a diagnosis of lymphoma in all the patients and the adopted treatment regimens were as follows: Stereotactic biopsy in combination with methylprednisolone (MP) and methotrexate (MTX) and/or radiotherapy; craniotomy in combination with dexamethasone or MP and/or radiotherapy; and neuroendoscopic surgery in combination with MP and MTX. The follow-up period was 5â€“27 months with an average duration of 10.1 months. After the initial three months of follow-up, the clinical symptoms of all the patients were significantly improved, with the tumor disappearing in seven patients and evidently reducing in size in two patients. However, six patients exhibited tumor recurrence, three of whom eventually succumbed to the disease during the follow-up period. Currently, comprehensive treatment strategies based on a combination of stereotactic biopsy, chemotherapy and radiotherapy are recommended for the treatment of PCNSL. However, the effectiveness of these treatments remains unsatisfactory. Thus, future studies are required to investigate methods for improving the efficacy of PCNSL treatment strategies.
