Diabetic foot ulcers (DFU) are one of the most important complications in people with diabetes mellitus. The present study was aimed to retrospectively review the efficacy of at least 1-week medical treatment before any surgical intervention in patients with Grade-3 and higher DFU according to Wagner's classification. A total of 52 patients (36 males and 16 females) hospitalized and treated between June 2006 and February 2009 and had initially received therapeutic treatment (local wound care, antibiotic therapy and blood glucose regulation) for a period of at least 1 week were included in the study. The level of amputation, rates of reulceration and mortality in both groups were recorded in the following period of 2 years. Group 1 (did not respond to preoperative medical intervention) included 16 patients where a surgical debridement, flap or skin graft surgery was performed in 2 (12.5%) patients, major amputation was performed in another 2 (12.5%) patients and minor amputation was performed in the remaining 12 (75%) patients. Of 36 patients in Group 2 (did respond to preoperative medical intervention), 5 (13.9%) patients underwent the surgical debridement, flap or skin graft surgery, 8 (22.2%) patients had a major amputation and the remaining 23 (63.9%) patients lead to a minor amputation. The ulcer recurrence and mortality rates were obtained as 2 (12.5%) and 2 (12.5%) in Group 1 and 2 (5.6%) and 1 (2.8%) in Group 2, respectively. Despite the lower rates of ulcer recurrence and mortality in patients having adequate responses to initial treatment before surgical procedures were performed, no statistically significant difference was observed between the 2 groups. In addition, there was no statistically significant difference between the levels of amputation in both groups.
