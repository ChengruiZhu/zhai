The aetiology and pathophysiology of diabetes appears comparable in Middle Eastern and other populations. Lifestyle intervention is key to the management of diabetes in all type 2 diabetes patients, who should be encouraged strongly to diet and exercise. The options for pharmacologic therapy in the management of diabetes have increased recently, particularly the number of potential antidiabetic combinations. Metformin appears to be used less frequently to initiate antidiabetic therapy in the Middle East than in other countries. Available clinical evidence, supported by current guidelines, strongly favours the initiation of antidiabetic therapy with metformin in Middle Eastern type 2 diabetes patients, where no contraindications exist. This is due to its equivalent or greater efficacy relative to other oral antidiabetic treatments, its proven tolerability and safety profiles, its weight neutrality, the lack of clinically significant hypoglycaemia, the demonstration of cardiovascular protection for metformin relative to diet in the UK Prospective Diabetes Study and in observational studies, and its low cost. Additional treatments should be added to metformin and lifestyle intervention as diabetes progresses, until patients are receiving an intensive insulin regimen with or without additional oral agents.
