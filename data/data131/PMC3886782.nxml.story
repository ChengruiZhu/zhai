We used gradings of fundus photography measurements from the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities Study to examine the association of retinopathy and retinal arteriolar and venular calibers to the number of ideal CV health metrics. Prevalent retinopathy showed a graded relationship with the CV health categories and number of ideal CV health metrics present: retinopathy prevalence was 2.1% among those with ≥5 ideal CV health metrics compared with 13.1% among those with zero ideal CV health metrics (odds ratio [CI]), 4.8 [2.5 to 8.9]). Central retinal venule equivalent and central retinal arteriolar equivalent diameters also showed graded relationships with CV health categories and number of ideal CV health metrics: after adjustment for age, race, sex, and education, mean central retinal venular equivalent was 187.8 μm (95% CI, 186.9 to 188.6 μm) among those with ≥5 ideal CV health metrics compared with 201.1 μm (95% CI, 199.1 to 203.1 μm) among those with zero ideal CV health metrics. Mean central retinal arteriolar equivalent was 163.8 μm (95% CI, 163.0 to 164.5 μm) among those with ≥5 ideal CV health metrics compared with 157.9 μm (95% CI, 156.1 to 159.7 μm) among those with zero ideal CV health metrics.
