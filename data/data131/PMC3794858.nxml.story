Clathrin-mediated endocytosis is the major entry portal for cargo molecules such as nutrient and signaling receptors in eukaryotic cells. Generation of clathrin-coated vesicles involves a complex protein machinery that both deforms the membrane to generate a vesicle and selects appropriate cargo. The endocytic machinery is formed around the core endocytic adapter protein AP-2, which recruits clathrin and numerous accessory proteins to the site of vesicle formation in a temporally and spatially controlled manner. Yet it remains elusive as to how these interactions are regulated to ensure efficient vesicle formation. Here we identify the endocytic protein NECAP 1 as a modulator of AP-2 interactions. We show that NECAP 1 and AP-2 form two functionally distinct complexes. In the first, NECAP 1 binds to two sites on AP-2 in such a manner as to limit accessory protein binding to AP-2. Recruitment of clathrin to vesicle formation sites displaces NECAP 1 from one of these sites, leading to the formation of a second complex in which NECAP 1 and AP-2 cooperate for efficient accessory protein recruitment. Through these interactions, NECAP 1 fine-tunes AP-2 function and the two proteins cooperate to increase the probability that a vesicle will form and to determine the size and cargo content of the resulting vesicle.
