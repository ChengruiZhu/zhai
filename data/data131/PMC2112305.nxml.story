Stationary phase cultures of Candida albicans inoculated into fresh medium at 37 degrees C synchronously from buds at pH 4.5 and mycelia at pH 6.5. During bud formation, a filament ring forms just under the plasma membrane at the mother cell-bud junction at roughly the time of evagination. A filament ring also forms in mycelium-forming cells, but it appears later than in a budding cell and it is positioned along the elongating mycelium, on the average 2 microns from the mother cell- mycelium junction. Sections of filament rings in early and late budding cells and in mycelia appear similar. Each contains approximately 11 to 12 filaments equidistant from one another and closely associated with the plasma membrane. In both budding and mycelium-forming cells, the filament ring disappears when the primary septum grows inward. The close temporal and spatial association of the filament ring and the subsequent chitin-containing septum suggests a role for the filament ring in septum formation. In addition, a close temporal correlation is demonstrated between filament ring formation and the time at which cells become committed to bud formation at pH 4.5 and mycelium formation at pH 6.5. The temporal and spatial differences in filament ring formation between the two growth forms also suggest a simple model for the positioning of the filament ring.
