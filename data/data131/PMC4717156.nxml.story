Coronary artery disease is the leading cause of death worldwide. Many trials to date have investigated the diagnostic accuracy of coronary computed tomography angiography (CCTA) when compared to the gold standard diagnostic test, invasive coronary angiography. However, whether the use of a non-invasive anatomical test, such as CCTA, can translate into improved patient risk stratification, management and outcome has yet to be established. The Scottish COmputed Tomography of the HEART (SCOT-HEART) trial sought to address these questions and determined whether CCTA, when used in addition to standard care, could aid the diagnosis, further investigation and treatment of patients referred to the cardiology clinic with suspected angina due to coronary heart disease. In this trial, CCTA clarified the diagnosis of angina due to coronary heart disease in a quarter of patients and this led to major alterations in treatment and management that appeared to reduce the risk of subsequent coronary heart disease death or non-fatal myocardial infarction. The SCOT-Heart trial has established that CCTA is a valuable diagnostic test in patients with suspected angina pectoris due to coronary heart disease and leads to greater clarity, more focused appropriate treatments and better coronary heart disease outcomes.
