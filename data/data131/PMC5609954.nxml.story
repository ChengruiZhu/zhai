Plasma exosomal miRNAs were evaluated for prognosis in an initial set of 44 metastatic renal cell cancer (mRCC) patients by RNA sequencing. Among âˆ¼3.49 million mappable reads per patient, miRNAs accounted for 93.1% of the mapped RNAs. 227 miRNAs with high abundance were selected for survival analysis. Cox regression analysis identified association of 6 miRNAs with overall survival (OS) (P<0.01, False discovery rate (FDR) < 0.3). Five of the associated miRNAs were quantified in an independent follow-up cohort of 65 mRCC patients by TaqMan-based miRNA assays. Kaplan-Meier analysis confirmed the significant OS association of three miRs; miR-let-7i-5p (P=0.018, HR=0.49, 95% CI=0.21-0.84), miR-26a-1-3p (P=0.025, HR=0.43, 95% CI=0.10-0.84) and miR-615-3p (P=0.0007, HR=0.36, 95% CI=0.11-0.54). A multivariate analysis of miR-let-7i-5p with the clinical factor-based Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center (MSKCC) score improved survival prediction from an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.58 for MSKCC score to an average AUC of 0.64 across 48-month follow-up time. The multivariate model was able to define a high-risk group with median survival of 14 months and low risk group of 39 months (P=0.0002, HR=3.43, 95%CI, 2.73-24.15). Further validation of miRNA-based prognostic biomarkers are needed to improve current clinic-pathologic based prognostic models in patients with mRCC.
