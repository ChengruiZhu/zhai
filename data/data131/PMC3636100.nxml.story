Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have thus far identified only a small fraction of the heritability of common complex disorders, such as severe mental disorders. We used a conditional false discovery rate approach for analysis of GWAS data, exploiting “genetic pleiotropy” to increase discovery of common gene variants associated with schizophrenia and bipolar disorders. Leveraging the increased power from combining GWAS of two associated phenotypes, we found a striking overlap in polygenic signals, allowing for the discovery of several new common gene variants associated with bipolar disorder and schizophrenia that were not identified in the original analysis using traditional GWAS methods. Some of the gene variants have been identified in other studies with large targeted replication samples, validating the present findings. Our pleiotropy-informed method may be of significant importance for detecting effects that are below the traditional genome-wide significance level in GWAS, particularly in highly polygenic, complex phenotypes, such as schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, where most of the genetic signal is missing (i.e., “missing heritability”). The findings also offer insights into mechanistic relationships between bipolar disorder and schizophrenia pathogenesis.
