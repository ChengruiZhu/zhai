The immune system can be viewed as a complex system, which adapts, over time, to reflect the history of infections experienced by the organism. This paper describes a model that captures this adaptation and corresponding robust, yet fragile behavior. To model immunological processes that rely on binding specificity, researchers typically utilize abstract shape space models. These models describe the binding characteristics of a receptor or antigen as points in a high dimensional vector space. Stromberg and Carlson have incorporated the concept of shape space into a dynamical model of immune response. They use this model to examine the development of the system over a series of infections and monitor the severity of disease for each infection. The diseases are drawn at random from a distribution having a few frequently reoccurring and many rare. The system is observed to adapt over a series of infections, becoming robust to the frequent diseases while developing fragility to the rare diseases. This age-correlated weakness arises from the underlying dynamics of system adaptation rather than from an accumulation of defects. This robust, yet fragile behavior is a signature of Highly Optimized Tolerance, a mechanism for complexity based on robustness tradeoffs.
