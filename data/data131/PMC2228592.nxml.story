Responses of three groups of neural fibers from the chorda tympani of the hamster to binary mixtures of taste stimuli applied to the tongue were analyzed. The groups displayed different sensitivities to six chemicals at concentrations that had approximately equal effects on the whole nerve. Sucrose-best fibers responded strongly only to sucrose and D-phenylalanine. NaCl-best and HCl-best fibers, responded to four electrolytes: equally to CaCl2 and nearly equally to HCl, but the former responded more to NaCl, and the latter responded more to NH4Cl. The groups of fibers dealt differently with binary mixtures. Sucrose- best fibers responded to a mixture of sucrose and D-phenylalanine as if one of the chemicals had been appropriately increased in concentration, but they responded to a mixture of either one and an electrolyte as if the concentration of sucrose or D-phenylalanine had been reduced. NaCl- best fibers responded to a mixture as if it were a "mixture" of two appropriate concentrations of one chemical, or somewhat less. But, responses of HCl-best fibers to mixtures were greater than that, approaching a sum of responses to components. These results explain effects on the whole nerve, suggest that the sensitivity of a mammalian taste receptor to one chemical can be affected by a second, which may or may not be a stimulus for that receptor, and suggest that some effects of taste mixtures in humans may be the result of peripheral processes.
