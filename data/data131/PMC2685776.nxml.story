The transcriptional activity of the tumor suppressor p53 requires direct binding between its transactivation domain (TAD, 1-57) and the transcriptional coactivator p300. We systematically assessed the role of TAD phosphorylation on binding of the p300 domains CH3, Taz1, Kix and IBiD. Thr18 phosphorylation increased the affinity up to 7-fold for CH3 and Taz1, with smaller increases from phosphorylation of Ser20, Ser15, Ser37, Ser33, Ser46 and Thr55. Binding of Kix and IBiD was less sensitive to phosphorylation. Strikingly, hepta-phosphorylation of all Ser and Thr residues increased binding 40- and 80-fold with CH3 and Taz1, respectively, but not with Kix or Ibid. Substitution of all phospho-sites with aspartates partially mimicked the effects of hepta-phosphorylation. Mdm2, the main negative regulator of p53, competes with p300 for binding TAD. Binding of Mdm2 to TAD was reduced significantly only on phosphorylation of Thr18 (7-fold) or by hepta-phosphorylation (24-fold). The relative affinities of Mdm2 and p300 for p53 TAD can thus be changed by up to three orders of magnitude by phosphorylation. Accordingly, phosphorylation of Thr18 and hepta-phosphorylation dramatically shifts the balance to favouring binding of p300 with p53 and is thus likely to be an important factor in its regulation.
