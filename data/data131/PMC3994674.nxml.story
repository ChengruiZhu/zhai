Background: Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is the prototype of autoimmune connective tissue diseases. Renal disease is a frequent manifestation of SLE that influences the outcome of the patients. The aim of the current study was to determine and analyze the clinical features and subsequent outcome of 70 patients with LN, followed in our department over the past 5 years, focusing on the impact of cardiovascular risk factors in the renal outcome and mortality. Patients and methods: Our prospective study included 70 patients with SLE and LN and 70 patients with SLE without signs of renal involvement, all patients fulfilled the revised ACR (American College of Rheumatology) criteria for the classification of SLE. Demographical data, risk factors and comorbidities were recorded. Results: Patients with lupus nephritis had a mean age of 37 years (range 15-65, SD 1.8). During the study, we had a rate of drop off of 15 patients with lupus nephritis (21%) and 19 patients without nephritis (26%). Patients with LN had a higher prevalence of positive anti-dsDNA antibodies (85.4% vs 49%, p<0.001, RR=2.2) and a lower percent of rheumatoid factor (FR) positive (5.45% vs 15.68%, p=0.03, RR=0.34) compared with the controls, a higher prevalence of corticosteroid treatment (65.45% vs 7.83%, p<0.001, RR=2.1) and immunosuppressive treatment (AZA 27.27% vs 3.92%, p=0.01, RR=1.71, CFM 34.54% vs 0%, p<0.001, RR=2.16), a higher frequency of hypertension (47.27% vs 9.8%, p<0.001, RR=2.4), hyperlipidaemia (49.09% vs 1.96%, p<0.001, RR=1.81) and anti-PL antibodies (49.09% vs 20%, p=0.001, RR=2.70),and a higher mortality (16% vs 2%, p=0.02, RR=1.76). 20 patients (36.36%) from the survival group (55 patients), evoluated to renal failure, 9.09% of these with end -stage renal failure, results that are similar with the ones in other studies. Conclusions: The study reveals the fact that cardiovascular risk factors such as hypertension, hyperlipidaemia and antiphospholipid syndrome are associated with a higer rate of mortality and an evolution to end-stage renal disease.
