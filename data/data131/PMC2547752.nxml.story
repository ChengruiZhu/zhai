 levels of the analyte, but, because of the transient nature of the signals, a sophisticated approach to the data aquisition and handling of data is required. Most modern commercial graphite furnace atomic absorption spectrometers have built in microprocessors for this purpose but they often have limited capability for extensible user programs and limited data storage facilities. In this communication we describe the use of an Apple IIe microcomputer for the acquisition of data from a Pye Unicam SP9 graphite furnace atomic absorption spectrometer. Details of the interface which utilizes an in-house designed AD converter, and an overview of the Pascal and assembler programs employed are given. The system allows the user to record, store and dump the graphical display of the furnace signalsfor all analyses performed. Files containing details of peak height, and area are formatted on an eight-column spreadsheet. Details of sample type, concentrations of standards, dilutions and replication are entered from the keyboard. The calibration graph is constructed using a moving quadratic fit routine and the concentrations of the analyte in unknown solutions calculated. In addition to this, greater processing power and integration of the data into other analytical schemes can be achieved by exporting the data to other software packages and computers. Details of data transfer between the Apple IIe and an Amstrad PC 1512 are given. Some examples of the use of the system in the development of an analytical methodfor silver in plant material are given.
