In the present study, we compared mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) derived from 4 different sources, human bone marrow (BM), adipose tissue (AT), umbilical cord Whartonâ€™s Jelly (WJ) and the placenta (PL), in order to determine which population of MSCs displayed the most prominent immunosuppressive effects on phytohemagglutinin-induced T cell proliferation, and which one had the highest proliferative and differentiation potential. MSC and T lymphocyte co-culture (mixed culture) was used to determine whether the MSCs inhibit T cell proliferation, as well as which population of MSCs has the strongest inhibitory ability. The expression of immune-related genes was analyzed by RT-PCR and RT-qPCR. The proliferation and differentiation potential of the MSCs were determined using standard methods. Following MSC and T cell co-culture, mitogen-induced T cell proliferation was effectively suppressed by all 4 populations of MSCs. This occurred through soluble factors rather than direct contact inhibition. Among the 4 populations of MSCs, the WJ-MSC has the strongest suppression effects. On immune related genes, WJ-MSC has the weakest expression of MHC II genes, TLR4, TLR3, JAG1, NOTCH2 and NOTCH3. To compare the proliferation potential, WJ-MSCs showed the most rapid growth rate followed by the AT-, PL- and BM-MSCs. As regards differentiation potential, the WJ-MSCs had the strongest osteogenetic ability followed by PL, AT and BM-MSC. AT-MSC has the strongest adipogenetic ability followed by the WJ-, BM- and PL-MSCs. These data indicated that the WJ-MSCs had the strongest immunomodulatory and immunosuppressive potential. In light of these observations, we suggest that WJ-MSCs are the most attractive cell population for use in immune cellular therapy when immunosuppressive action is required.
