, AU) may play a role in reducing blood pressure, inhibiting angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE), as well as improving right ventricle function in rabbit models with heart failure. We hypothesize that AU may mitigate cardiovascular damage caused by pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) and has value in the supplementary treatment of the complications of the disease. In this present investigation, PAH was induced by a single dose of monocrotaline (MCT) injection in Sprague-Dawley rats, and animals were divided into 4 treatment groups as follows: I. healthy control animals (Control group); II. pulmonary hypertensive rats (PAH group); III. pulmonary hypertensive rats + daily sildenafil treatment (Sildenafil group); and IV. pulmonary hypertensive rats + Wild garlic liophylisate-enriched chow (WGLL group), for 8 weeks. Echocardiographic measurements were obtained on the 0 and 8 weeks with fundamental and Doppler imaging. Isolated working heart method was used to determinate cardiac functions ex vivo after thoracotomy on the 8th week. Histological analyses were carried out on excised lung samples, and Western blot technique was used to determine Phosphodiesterase type 5 enzyme (PDE5) expression in both myocardial and pulmonary tissues. Our data demonstrate that right ventricle function measured by echocardiography was deteriorated in PAH animals compared to controls, which was counteracted by AU treatment. Isolated working heart measurements showed elevated aortic flow in WGLL group compared to PAH animals. Histological analysis revealed dramatic increase in medial wall thickness of pulmonary arteries harvested from PAH animals, but arteries of animals in sildenafil- and WGLL-treated groups showed physiological status. Our results suggest that bioactive compounds in
