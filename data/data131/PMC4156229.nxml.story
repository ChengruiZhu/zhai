Squamous cell carcinoma is a common malignant tumor of the uterine cervix. The present study reports the case of squamous cell carcinoma of the uterine cervix with osteoclast-like giant cells (OGCs) in an 84-year-old female who had suffered from irregular vaginal bleeding for one month. Colposcopy was performed and a cauliflower-like mass was identified in the front lip of the uterine cervix. Biopsy was then performed, and the tumor was found to be composed of epithelial cell nests, ranging in size. The neoplastic cells exhibited unclear boundaries and eosinophilic cytoplasm. Additionally, the nuclei were atypical and mitosis was observed. Among the epithelial nests, there were numerous OGCs with abundant eosinophilic cytoplasm, as well as multinucleation with bland nuclei. By immunohistochemical staining, the epithelial cells were positive for cytokeratin, while negative for CD68 and vimentin. By contrast, the immunophenotype of the OGCs was the exact opposite. Based on the histological characters, a diagnosis of squamous cell carcinoma of the uterine cervix associated with OGCs was made. Considering the age of the patient, radiotherapy was administered. The patient succumbed to brain metastasis of the tumor after eight months of follow-up.
