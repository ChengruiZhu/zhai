The term “motor neuron disease” refers to a group of disorders, causing progressive paralysis of affected patients due to the degeneration of motor neurons cells which control voluntary movements. Importantly, not all motor neurons appear to be affected in the same way, with those that control the face being affected less that those that control the abdomen. The reason why some motor neurons are more vulnerable is unknown; however, understanding this may provide new targets for therapeutics to slow motor neuron degeneration either as stand-alone therapeutics or in combination with SMN-inducing compounds. In this study, we analysed gene expression in different groups of motor neurons and compared this to previously published expression data to identify commonalities. One of the common transcripts was alpha-synuclein (SNCA), which was consistently expressed at lower levels in vulnerable motor neurons. Importantly, when SNCA levels were increased in a mouse model of motor neuron disease, the disease phenotype was significantly reduced, including an extension in survival and reduction in motor neuron pathology. Collectively, these results demonstrate that this approach can identify disease modifiers that can reduce disease severity in models of motor neuron disease and potentially identify new therapeutic targets.
