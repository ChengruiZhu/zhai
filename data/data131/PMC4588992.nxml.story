Eleven cadaveric knees were employed for this study. The 3D laser scanner was used to obtain 3D profile of the femur. Firstly, we indicate a point of the joint surface from the obtained mesh data and calculate the normal vector of the indicated point. Moreover, we determine an analysis area of a constant diameter from the normal vector, and calculate the vertical interval (VI) from the highest and lowest points along within the analysis area. For the data analysis, we divided the donor and recipient sites into the 12 areas. In the donor site, the peripheral and middle one-third areas of the femoral articular surface in medial and lateral patellofemoral (PF) joint were extracted and additionally, these areas were divided into 3 areas(proximal / interlevel / distal). In the recipient site, the peripheral, middle and central one-third areas of the articular surface in medial and lateral femoral condyle were extracted and moreover these areas were divided into the contact surface to the tibia in knee extension (anterior) and flexion (posterior). VIs were calculated in each area and we investigated the matching of the articular surface between the donor and recipient site for cylindrical osteochondral grafts of 6, 8 and 10 mm diameter.
