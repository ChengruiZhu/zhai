These findings provide insights into the process of national health agenda setting in Papua New Guinea, Uganda, and Sierra Leone and highlight the complex interplay of social and political factors underpinning this process. In particular, they identify three dominant factors that have influenced whether surgery is prioritized as a health issue in these three LMICs. Notably, the results from Papua New Guinea show that a strong surgical community can generate priority from the ground up, even when other factors are unfavorable for the prioritization of surgical care. These findings may not apply to other LMICS, and certain aspects of the study design may affect their accuracy. For example, the interviewers were surgeons or surgical trainees, which raises the possibility of interviewer bias. Overall, however, these findings suggest that sustained advocacy effort, effective framing of the problem of inadequate surgical care and of the solution to this problem, accurate country-specific data on surgical care indicators, and political, technical, and financial support from regional and international partners will all be needed to ensure that surgical care becomes a priority issue in national health agendas in LMICs.
