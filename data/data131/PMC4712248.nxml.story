 ant colonies, which inhabit ephemeral nest sites, and which frequently change their nests. In a laboratory experiment, ant colonies from one group were forced to change their nest sites 10 times over a ca. 3-month period, whilst colonies from the second group were forced to adopt this practice twice (on the beginning of May, and in the second half of July). Colonies of the ant from both the groups reduced their total emigration duration. However, the duration of the transport phase remained unchanged. In the case of colonies with higher level of disturbance, there was no relation between colony growth rate and energy allocation in sexual individuals, whilst a negative correlation between these parameters was present in group with lower level of disturbance. In colonies with lower level of disturbance, the investment in sexuals was not correlated with the number of workers at the end of the experiment, whereas such a correlation was demonstrated for colonies with higher level of disturbance. The disturbance, and thus necessity of frequent nest relocations, may be perceived by ants as a signal that nest sites are of a lower quality and may contribute to a change in energy allocation.
