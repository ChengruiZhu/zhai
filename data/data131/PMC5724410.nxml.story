Tetraspanin CD82, also known as KAI1, was revealed as an attractive prognostic tumor biomarker in recent studies. However, some results of these studies remained debatable and inconclusive. Therefore, we conducted a meta-analysis to clarify the precise predictive value of CD82 in various neoplasms. Qualified studies were identified up to April 27, 2017, by searching PubMed, EMBASE, and the Web of Science. In total, 29 eligible studies were ultimately enrolled in this meta-analysis. Pooled hazard ratios (HRs) with 95% CIs of overall survival and disease/recurrence/progression-free survival were calculated to evaluate the correct prognostic role of CD82. Statistical analysis demonstrated that high expression of CD82 was significantly associated with enhanced overall survival (HR =0.56, 95% CI: 0.47–0.67) and disease/recurrence/progression-free survival (HR =0.42, 95% CI: 0.30–0.59) in cancer patients. Furthermore, we also conducted the subgroup analysis and the results revealed that CD82 was associated with favorable outcomes in cancer patients. Taken together, CD82 could be a promising biomarker for predicting the prognosis of patients with malignant neoplasms, and the biological functions of CD82 are of great research value of the subject.
