Most DNA can typically be divided into two categories: regions that encode the instructions for the assembly of a protein molecule (protein-coding genes) and those that do not (noncoding). Although mammalian genomes are primarily noncoding, relatively little is known about how much of this is functional, where such regions are found in the genome, and what functions they are likely to perform. In this study, the authors investigated the quantity and location of functional noncoding DNA in mice and rats. They estimate that functional noncoding DNA is at least three times as common as coding DNA in rodents, and the majority is located large distances from known protein-coding genes. Putatively functional intronic DNA tends to be clustered towards the gene 5â€² end, suggesting that much intronic sequence is instrumental in regulating gene expression. This study also finds that genes involved in development and the nervous system are typically associated with much higher quantities of functional noncoding DNA, suggesting that these genes require more finely tuned control of their expression. One implication of this study is the finding that disease-causing mutations have occurred more frequently in noncoding regions and may have affected gene expression, rather than protein structure.
