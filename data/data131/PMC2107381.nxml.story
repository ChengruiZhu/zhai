 (Lepidoptera, Hesperiidae) takes up protein from the blood throughout the larval stage before pupation. Depending upon the phase of development, the protein appears in multivesicular bodies, in large storage granules, and in structures of intermediate form. There are three phases in the 8 days of the last larval stage; the first devoted to growth (molting to 66 hr), the second to synthesis for storage or export (M + 66 to M + 156 hr), and the third to preparation for pupation (M + 156 to pupation at M + 192 hr). From M + O to M + 156 and from M + 180 to M + 188 hr, protein is taken up into multivesicular bodies. Larger MVB's form a continuous series with the protein granules formed from M + 162 to M + 180 hr. Blood proteins increase in concentration and amount from M + 66 to M + 156 hr at the same time as the fat body cells have a high rate of incorporation of amino acids and a structure appropriate for protein synthesis. During granule formation, both amino acid incorporation and blood protein concentration decrease. Since foreign proteins injected into the blood appear in the granules, they are probably made mainly from sequestered blood. Protein uptake involves two stages: concentration between the cells, and ingestion in pinocytotic vesicles. The vesicles fuse to become MVB's or storage granules, depending upon their rates of growth and the addition of lytic enzymes. Since MVB's do not accumulate in the fat body and since many of them contain acid phosphatase and appear empty, they are presumed to be concerned in protein turnover.
