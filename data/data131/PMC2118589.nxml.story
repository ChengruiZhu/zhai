The molecular mechanisms responsible for the sustained basal motility of T cells within lymph nodes (LNs) remain elusive. To study T cell motility in a LN environment, we have developed a new experimental system based on slices of LNs that allows the assessment of T cell trafficking after adoptive transfer or direct addition of T cells to the slice. Using this experimental system, we show that T cell motility is highly sensitive to pertussis toxin and strongly depends on CCR7 and its ligands. Our results also demonstrate that, despite its established role in myeloid cell locomotion, phosphoinositide 3â€“kinase (PI3K) activity does not contribute to the exploratory behavior of the T lymphocytes within LN slices. Likewise, although PI3K activation is detectable in chemokine-treated T cells, PI3K plays only a minor role in T cell polarization and migration in vitro. Collectively, our results suggest that the common amplification system that, in other cells, facilitates large phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate increases at the plasma membrane is absent in T cells. We conclude that T cell motility within LNs is not an intrinsic property of T lymphocytes but is driven in a PI3K-independent manner by the lymphoid chemokine-rich environment.
