Endoscopic screening for detecting cancer and cancer precursors in Barrettâ€™s esophagus (BE) is currently informed by repeated systematic biopsying of the metaplastic BE tissue. Here we present a comprehensive multiscale model of the natural history of esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC), which describes the entire multistage process beginning with the conversion event of normal squamous esophageal tissue to BE metaplasia, the spatio-temporal formation of independent dysplastic and malignant clones at the cell level, and finally the appearance of symptomatic EAC in BE. This model lends itself to a systematic exploration of the efficacy and sensitivity of current biopsy-based screening methods to detect neoplasia in BE patients, as well as alternative screening techniques based on high-resolution imaging of the BE tissue. Moreover, the model can also be used to predict the impact of ablative treatments on the risk of occurrence or recurrence of dysplasia or cancer. Due to the lack of studies that attempt to explicitly model the physical and biological dimensions of the screening process itself, our computational model provides a unique, publicly-available tool to improve understanding of factors that limit the efficacy of current screening protocols for BE patients.
