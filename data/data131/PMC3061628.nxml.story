From the time that it was granted US Food and Drug Administration approval, neuromodulation has secured a firm position in the treatment algorithm for overactive bladder. With neuromodulation, physicians were able to bridge the gap between the two ends of the treatment spectrum (medical therapy and open surgery). Sacral nerve stimulation has been the most widely used form of neuromodulation. Recent modifications to its design, namely the development of the tined lead and the launching of the refined InterStim II (Medtronic, Minneapolis, MN), have made sacral nerve simulation even less invasive and more effective. While InterStim is maintaining a level of success with these advancements, peripheral means of neuromodulation are being explored. The current literature takes a closer look at posterior tibial and pudendal nerve stimulation as alternatives to sacral nerve stimulation. The field of neuromodulation is also expanding in terms of the target patient population, as it is being used to treat children, patients with neurological disease, and others. As the role of neuromodulation increases, we must continue to assess its efficacy, safety, and cost-effectiveness in comparison to other therapeutic options.
