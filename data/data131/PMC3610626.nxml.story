We explore a fundamental question with regard to the representation of sound in the auditory system, namely: what are the coding strategies that underlie observed neurophysiological responses in central auditory areas? There has been debate in recent years as to whether neural ensembles explicitly minimize their propensity to fire (the so-called sparse coding hypothesis) or whether neurons exhibit strong, sustained firing rates when processing their preferred stimuli. Using computational modeling, we directly confront issues raised in this debate, and our results suggest that not only does a sustained firing strategy yield a sparse representation of sound, but the principle yields emergent neural ensembles that capture the rich structural variations present in natural stimuli. In particular, spectro-temporal receptive fields (STRFs) have been widely used to characterize the processing mechanisms of central auditory neurons and have revealed much about the nature of sound processing in central auditory areas. In our paper, we demonstrate how neurons that maximize a sustained firing objective yield STRFs akin to those commonly measured in physiological studies, capturing a wide range of aspects of natural sounds over a variety of timescales, suggesting that such a coding strategy underlies observed neural responses.
