Facial symmetry is an important component of attractiveness. However, functional symmetry is favorable to aesthetic symmetry. In addition, fluctuating asymmetry is more natural and common, even if patients find such asymmetry to be noticeable. However, fluctuating asymmetry remains difficult to define. Several studies have shown that a certain level of asymmetry could generate an unfavorable image. A natural profile is favorable to perfect mirror-image profile, and images with canting and differences less than 3°-4° and 3-4 mm, respectively, are generally not recognized as asymmetry. In this study, a questionnaire survey among 434 medical students was used to evaluate photos of Asian women. The students preferred original images over mirror images. Facial asymmetry was noticed when the canting and difference were more than 3° and 3 mm, respectively. When a certain level of asymmetry is recognizable, correcting it can help to improve social life and human relationships. Prior to any operation, the anatomical component for noticeable asymmetry should be understood, which can be divided into hard tissues and soft tissue. For diagnosis, two-and three-dimensional (3D) photogrammetry and radiometry are used, including photography, laser scanner, cephalometry, and 3D computed tomography.
