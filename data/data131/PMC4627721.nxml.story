In interocular suppression, a visible target presented in one eye can be rendered invisible by a competing image (the competitor) presented in the other eye. This phenomenon is a striking demonstration of the discrepancy between physical inputs to the visual system and perception, and it also allows neuroscientists to study how perceptual systems regulate competing information. Interocular suppression has been explained by mutually suppressive interactions (modeled by divisive normalization) between neurons that respond differentially to the two eyes. Attention, which selects relevant information in natural viewing condition, has also been found to play a role in interocular suppression. But the specific role of attentional modulation is still an open question. In this study, we proposed a computational model of interocular suppression integrating both attentional modulation and divisive normalization. By modeling the hypothetical neural responses and fitting the model to psychophysical data, we showed that interocular suppression involves an attentional modulation selective for the orientation of the competitor, and covering the spatial extent of the competitor. We conclude that both attention and divisive normalization contribute to interocular suppression, and that their impacts are distinguishable.
