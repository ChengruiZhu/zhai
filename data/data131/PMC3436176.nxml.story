-containing peptide, suggesting that the dimer binds multiple, discrete peptide helices. Differential inhibition of dimer binding by dimer-specific antibodies, m-Fab-F and 204-11 Fab, suggests that m-Fab-F binds at the collagen-binding site of the dimer, and 204-11 Fab binds to a discrete site. Flow cytometric quantitation indicated that GPVI dimers account for ∼29% of total GPVI in resting platelets, whereas activation by either collagen-related peptide or thrombin increases the number of dimers to ∼39 and ∼44%, respectively. m-Fab-F inhibits both GPVI-dependent static platelet adhesion to collagen and thrombus formation on collagen under low and high shear, indicating that pre-existing dimeric GPVI is required for the initial interaction with collagen because affinity of the monomer is too low to support binding and that interaction through the dimer is essential for platelet activation. These GPVI dimers in resting circulating platelets will enable them to bind injury-exposed subendothelial collagen to initiate platelet activation. The GPVI-specific agonist collagen-related peptide or thrombin further increases the number of dimers, thereby providing a feedback mechanism for reinforcing binding to collagen and platelet activation.
