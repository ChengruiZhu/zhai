Tissue fusion, the process by which two independent prominences become united to form one continuous structure, is common during development, and its failure leads to multiple structural birth defects. In this study, we directly examine the cellular and molecular mechanisms by which tissue fusion occurs using the mouse secondary palate as a model. Using live imaging, we find that fusion of the secondary palatal shelves proceeds by a progression of previously undescribed cell behaviors. Cellular protrusions and establishment of contacts between palatal shelves leads to the formation of a transient multicellular epithelial structure that then converges toward the midline, driven by cell intercalation. This convergence occurs together with displacement of the epithelium and epithelial cell extrusions that squeeze epithelial cells out from between the palatal shelves and mediate continuity of the structure. We show that in mice this morphogenesis requires an actomyosin contractility pathway culminating in non-muscle myosin IIA activation. Altogether, these data support a new model for tissue fusion during mouse embryogenesis in which convergence, displacement, and cell extrusion drive the union of independent structures.
