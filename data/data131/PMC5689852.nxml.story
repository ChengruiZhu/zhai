 Brachy Advanced Collapsed‐cone Engine (ACE) for a multichannel vaginal cylinder (MCVC) applicator using radiochromic film. A uniform dose of 500 cGy was specified to the surface of the MCVC using the TG‐43 dose formalism under two conditions: (a) with only the central channel loaded or (b) only the peripheral channels loaded. Film measurements were made at the applicator surface and compared to the doses calculated using TG‐43, standard accuracy ACE (sACE), and high accuracy ACE (hACE). When the central channel of the applicator was used, the film measurements showed a dose increase of (11 ± 8)% (k = 2) above the two outer grooves on the applicator surface. This increase in dose was confirmed with the hACE calculations, but was not confirmed with the sACE calculations at the applicator surface. When the peripheral channels were used, a periodic azimuthal variation in measured dose was observed around the applicator. The sACE and hACE calculations confirmed this variation and agreed within 1% of each other at the applicator surface. Additionally for the film measurements with the central channel used, a baseline dose variation of (10 ± 4)% (k = 2) of the mean dose was observed azimuthally around the applicator surface, which can be explained by offset source positioning in the central channel.
