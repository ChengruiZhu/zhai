We examined the block of voltage-dependent rat skeletal muscle sodium channels by derivatives of μ-conotoxin GIIIA (μCTX) having either histidine, glutamate, or alanine residues substituted for arginine-13. Toxin binding and dissociation were observed as current fluctuations from single, batrachotoxin-treated sodium channels in planar lipid bilayers. R13X derivatives of μCTX only partially block the single-channel current, enabling us to directly monitor properties of both μCTX-bound and -unbound states under different conditions. The fractional residual current through the bound channel changes with pH according to a single-site titration curve for toxin derivatives R13E and R13H, reflecting the effect of changing the charge on residue 13, in the bound state. Experiments with R13A provided a control reflecting the effects of titration of all residues on toxin and channel other than toxin residue 13. The apparent pKs for the titration of residual conductance are shifted 2–3 pH units positive from the nominal pK values for histidine and glutamate, respectively, and from the values for these specific residues, determined in the toxin molecule in free solution by NMR measurements. Toxin affinity also changes dramatically as a function of pH, almost entirely due to changes in the association rate constant, k
