Synapses play a central role in neural information processing – weighting individual inputs in different ways allows neurons to perform a range of computations, and the changing of synaptic weights over time allows learning and recovery from injury. Intracellular recordings provide the most detailed view of the properties and dynamics of individual synapses, but studying many synapses simultaneously during natural behavior is not feasible with current methods. In contrast, extracellular recordings allow many neurons to be observed simultaneously, but the details of their synaptic interactions have to be inferred from spiking alone. By modeling how spikes from one neuron, statistically, affect the spiking of another neuron, statistical inference methods can reveal “functional” connections between neurons. Here we examine these methods using neuronal spiking evoked by intracellular injection of a defined artificial current that simulates input from a single presynaptic neuron or a large population of presynaptic neurons. We study how well functional connectivity methods are able to reconstruct the simulated inputs, and assess the validity and limitations of functional connectivity inference. We find that, with a sufficient amount of data, accurate inference is often possible, and can become more accurate as more of the presynaptic inputs are observed.
