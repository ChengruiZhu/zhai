 by transplantation of a radioactive nucleus into an unlabeled cell followed by examination of the cytoplasm of the recipient for the presence of label. When a RNA-labeled nucleus was used, label appeared in the ribosomes, ribosomal RNA, and soluble RNA. Since the kinetics of appearance of labeled RNA indicates that the nucleus was not injured during the transfer, and since the transferred nuclear pool of labeled acid-soluble RNA precursors is inadequate to account for the amount of cytoplasmic RNA label, it is concluded that cytoplasmic ribosomal RNA is derived from acid-insoluble nuclear RNA and is probably transported as an intact molecule. Likewise, cytoplasmic soluble RNA probably originated in the nucleus, although labeling by terminal exchange in the cytoplasm is also possible. The results were completely different when a protein-labeled nucleus was grafted into an unlabeled host. In this case, label was found only in soluble proteins in the host cell cytoplasm, and there were no (or very few) radioactive ribosomes. This suggests that the nuclear pool of ribosomal protein and ribosomal protein precursors is relatively small and perhaps nonexistent (and, furthermore, shows that there was no cytoplasmic ribosomal contamination of the transferred nucleus).
