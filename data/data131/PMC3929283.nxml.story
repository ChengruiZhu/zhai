The present study investigated the effects of oral administration of annatto carotenoids (bixin (BIX) and norbixin (NBIX)) on glucose levels, lipid profiles, and oxidative stress parameters in streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetic rats. Animals were treated for 30 days in the following groups: nondiabetic control, diabetic vehicle, diabetic 10 mg/kg BIX, diabetic 100 mg/kg BIX, diabetic 10 mg/kg NBIX, diabetic 100 mg/kg NBIX, diabetic metformin, and diabetic insulin. Blood glucose, LDL cholesterol, and triglyceride levels were reduced in the diabetic rats treated with BIX. BIX treatment prevented protein oxidation and nitric oxide production and restored superoxide dismutase activity. NBIX treatment did not change most parameters assessed, and at the highest dose, it increased LDL cholesterol and triglycerides levels and showed prooxidant action (increased protein oxidation and nitric oxide levels). These findings suggested that BIX could have an antihyperglycemic effect, improve lipid profiles, and protect against damage induced by oxidative stress in the diabetic state. Because NBIX is a water-soluble analog of BIX, we propose that lipophilicity is crucial for the protective effect of annatto carotenoids against streptozotocin-induced diabetes.
