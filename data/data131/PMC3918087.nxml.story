 (1)-acetyltransferase (SSAT), which are both involved in polyamine metabolism, suggesting that polyamines are involved in osteogenic differentiation of AT-MSCs. Furthermore, treatment of AT-MSCs with the polyamine spermine-regulated gene expression of runx-2, a transcription factor involved in early stages of osteogenic differentiation, and that of osteopontin, a bone matrix protein expressed in later stages of osteogenic differentiation. Runx-2 gene expression was increased 4 and 14 days after a short 30 min. treatment with spermine, while osteopontin gene expression was only increased 4 days after spermine treatment. Finally, alkaline phosphatase activity, which is intimately involved in the formation of extracellular matrix of bone, was increased 4 weeks after the 30 min.-spermine treatment of AT-MSCs. In conclusion, this study shows for the first time that the polyamine spermine regulates differentiation of AT-MSCs along the osteogenic lineage, which can be used as a new method for differentiation of AT-MSCs along the osteogenic lineage. Therefore, polyamines may constitute a promising tool for bone tissue engineering approaches using AT-MSCs, such as a one-step surgical procedure for spinal interbody fusion.
