Conventional persistent homology neglects chemical and biological information during the topological abstraction and thus has limited representational power for complex chemical and biological systems. In terms of methodological development, we introduce advanced persistent homology approaches for the characterization of small molecular structures which can capture subtle structural difference. We also introduce electrostatic persistent homology to embed physics in topological invariants. These approaches encipher physics, chemistry and biology, such as hydrogen bonds, electrostatics, van der Waals interactions, hydrophobicity and hydrophilicity, into topological fingerprints which, although cannot literally recast into physical interpretations, are ideally suitable for machine learning, particularly deep learning, rendering topological learning algorithms. In terms of applications, we construct a structure-based virtual screening model which outperforms other existing methods. This competitive model on the DUD database is derived by assessing the performance of a comprehensive collection of topological approaches proposed in this work and introduced in our earlier work, on the PDBBind database. The topological features constructed in this work can readily be applied to other biomolecular problems where the characterization of proteins or small molecules is needed.
