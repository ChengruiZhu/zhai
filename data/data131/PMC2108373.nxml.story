 A new class of filaments intermediate in diameter between actin and myosin filaments has been demonstrated in skeletal muscle cells cultured from chick embryos. These filaments, which account for the majority of free filaments, average 100 A in diameter. They may run for more than 2 Âµ in a single section and can be distinguished in size and appearance from the thick and thin filaments assembled into myofibrils. The 100-A filaments are seen scattered throughout the sarcoplasm at all stages of development and show no obvious association with the myofibrils. The 100-A filaments are particularly conspicuous in myotubes fragmented by the mitotic inhibitors, colchicine and Colcemid. In addition, filaments similar in size and appearance to those found in myotubes are present in fibroblasts, chondrocytes, and proliferating mononucleated myoblasts. The 100-A filaments are present in cells arrested in metaphase by mitotic inhibitors. Definitive thick (about 150 A) or thin (about 60 A) myofilaments are not found in skeletal myogenic cells arrested in metaphase. Myogenic cells arrested in metaphase do not bind fluorescein-labeled antibody directed against myosin or actin. For these reasons, it is concluded that not all "thin" filaments in myogenic cells are uniquely associated with myogenesis.
