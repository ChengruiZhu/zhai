IL-6 is critical for tumorigenesis. However, previous studies on the association of IL-6 promoter polymorphisms with predisposition to different cancer types are somewhat contradictory. Therefore, we performed this meta-analysis regarding the relationship between IL-6 promoter single nucleotide polymorphisms and cancer susceptibility and prognosis. Up to April 2017, 97 original publications were identified covering three IL-6 promoter SNPs. Our results showed statistically significant association between IL-6 promoter and cancer risk and prognosis. Subgroup analysis indicated that rs1800795 was significantly associated with increased risk of cervical cancer, colorectal cancer, breast cancer, prostate cancer, lung cancer, glioma, non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma and Hodgkin’s lymphoma but not gastric cancer and multiple myeloma. Furthermore, rs1800796 was significantly associated with increased risk of lung cancer, prostate cancer and colorectal cancer but not gastric cancer. Additionally, rs1800797 was significantly association with breast cancer, non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma, B-cell lymphoma and diffuse large B-cell lymphoma but not gastric cancer. Simultaneously, rs1800795 and rs1800796 were associated with a significantly higher risk of cancer in Asia and Caucasian, rs1800797 was associated with a significantly risk of cancer in Caucasian but not in Asia. Furthermore, IL-6 promoter polymorphisms were significantly associated with the prognosis of cancer. Considering these promising results, IL-6 promoter including rs1800795, rs1800796 and rs1800797 may be a tumor marker for cancer therapy.
