Altered cytokine production can lead to immune dysfunction in patients with cancer. The present study investigated the expression of T helper (Th)17 cytokines in patients with laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma (LSCC) and their clinical significance in providing new therapeutic insights. The prevalence of Th17 cells and their receptors in patients with LSCC was studied using immunohistochemical analysis via tissue microarray technology. Flow cytometry was used to investigate the percentage of Th17 and Th1 cells in peripheral blood mononuclear cells. Furthermore, the proliferation of Th17 cells and Th17-associated cytokines, including interleukin (IL)17, IL23 and RAR-related orphan receptor Î³t, was analyzed by reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction. The results revealed that the prevalence of Th17 cells in patients with LSCC was elevated in their primary tumors, as well as in peripheral blood, compared with that in healthy controls. It was further demonstrated that Th17 cells could be induced and expanded in the tumor microenvironment through cytokines produced by the tumor cells. In conclusion, Th17 cells have a substantial impact on the carcinogenesis of LSCCs, and could serve as a potential therapeutic target to modulate the anti-tumor response in these carcinomas.
