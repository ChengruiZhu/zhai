 (Coleoptera: Silphidae), which was regularly found in medium/large and large carcasses, the average rate showed only a slight and insignificant increase with an increase in carcass mass. These results indicate that lower efficiency of active decay in larger carcasses is a consequence of a multi-guild and competition-related pattern of this process. Pattern of mass loss in large and medium/large carcasses was not sigmoidal, but rather exponential. The overall rate of decomposition was strongly, but not linearly, related to carcass mass. In a range of low mass decomposition rate increased with an increase in mass, then at about 30Â kg, there was a distinct decrease in rate, and again at about 50 kg, the rate slightly increased. Until about 100 accumulated degree-days larger carcasses gained higher total body scores than smaller carcasses. Afterwards, the pattern was reversed; moreover, differences between classes of carcasses enlarged with the progress of decomposition. In conclusion, current results demonstrate that cadaver mass is a factor of key importance for decomposition, and as such, it should be taken into account by decomposition-related methods for post-mortem interval estimation.
