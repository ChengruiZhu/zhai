, which possesses multiple biological activities. Previous studies have shown that baicalin is protective in ischemic cerebral diseases. The aim of the present study was to examine the effects of baicalin on brain injury in a rat model of intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) and to explore the possible mechanisms. Intracerebral hemorrhage was induced in male Wistar rats by injection of 0.5 U collagenaseVII to the caudate nucleus. Sham operation rats were injected with equal volume of saline. After the induction of ICH, the rats were randomly divided into four groups and administered with different dose of baicalin (0, 25, 50, or 100 mg/kg in saline) through peritoneal injection. The brain tissues around the hemorrhage areas were collected on days 1, 3, and 5 after treatment. Brain edema was analyzed by desiccation method; the metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) protein and mRNA expression were determined by western blotting and real time RT-PCR, respectively. Nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) protein expression was analyzed by western blotting. IL-1β and IL-6 levels were determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Blood–brain barrier permeability was determined by Evans blue leakage method. The results showed that baicalin reduced brain edema following ICH in a dose-dependent manner, with concomitant inhibition of NF-κB activation and suppression of MMP-9 expression. In addition, baicalin also reduced IL-1β and IL-6 production, as well as blood–brain barrier permeability. The above results indicated that baicalin prevents against perihematomal edema development after intracerebral hemorrhage possibly through an anti-inflammatory mechanism.
