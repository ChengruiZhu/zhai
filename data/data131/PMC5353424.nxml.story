Sudden cardiac death (SCD) is defined as natural death due to cardiac causes, heralded by abrupt loss of consciousness within 1 h of the onset of acute symptoms; pre-existing heart disease may have been known to be present but the time and mode of death are unexpected. Prediction and prevention of SCD is an area of active investigation, but considerable challenges persist that limit the efficacy and cost-effectiveness of available methodologies. It was well-recognized that optimization of SCD risk stratification would require integration of multi-disciplinary efforts at the bench and bedside, with studies in the general population. This integration has yet to be effectively accomplished. There is also increasing awareness that more investigation needs to be directed toward the identification of early predictors of SCD. Significant advancements have recently occurred for risk prediction in the inherited channelopathies and other inherited conditions that predispose to SCD, but there is much to be accomplished in this regard for the more common complex phenotypes, such as SCD among patients with coronary artery disease. A multimodality imaging approach is actually the most important tool to provide comprehensive information on different pathophysiological mechanisms related to SCD.
