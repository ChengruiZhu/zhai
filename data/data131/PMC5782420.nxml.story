Obstructive sleep apnoea (OSAS) is an underdiagnosed chronic disease with a high prevalence in adults. It is becoming a significant social problem, since it is associated with a worsening in quality of life and increase in mortality. The cost-effectiveness ratio of diagnostic and therapeutic management of OSAS is a strategic issue to counteract the expected increasing demand of objective testing. OSAS patients with any clinical evidence of comorbidities must be studied using simplified and less expensive systems such as Home Sleep Testing (HST). On the other hand, Sleep Laboratory Polysomnography (PSG) is the gold standard to manage OSAS patients with comorbidities. It should be pointed out that the use of HST can lead to incorrect diagnosis in poorly selected OSAS subjects. This short review discusses various topics for the proper diagnosis and treatment of OSAS in view of epidemiological factors and results in terms of costs and social benefit of the disease. Whatever the strategy chosen and/or the organisational model adopted for managing OSAS, it cannot and should not take into account only cost-effectiveness. Long-term prospective studies evaluating cost-effectiveness ratios and outcomes of OSAS treatment of hospital management models versus home care models are needed.
