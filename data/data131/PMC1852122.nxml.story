In this study, five groups of patients were recruited and tests were done on each to find out whether infectious rotavirus was present in their bloodstream, and also whether the researchers could detect rotavirus components in blood using antibodies against particular parts of the rotavirus particle. The five groups of patients that were compared included children hospitalized with gastroenteritis; children hospitalized with noninfectious conditions; healthy adult laboratory workers; children with lung infections from known viruses; and finally children with lung infections of unknown cause. The researchers found that among the children with gastroenteritis who had rotavirus in their stool, 90% also had evidence of rotavirus particles in their bloodstream. By contrast, control individuals (either children who were hospitalized with noninfectious conditions or healthy adults) did not have rotavirus particles in blood. A small proportion of children with gastroenteritis but no rotavirus in their stool did have rotavirus particles in blood. Interestingly, a small proportion of the children who had lung infections (but in whom no known virus had been identified as the cause) showed evidence of rotavirus in their bloodstreams. Finally, in a group of 11 children with evidence of rotavirus particles in their bloodstreams, all were found to also have infectious virus present in the blood.
