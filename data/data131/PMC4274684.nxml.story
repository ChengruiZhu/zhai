In the past two decades, our ability to study cellular and molecular systems has been transformed through the development of omics sciences. While unlimited potential lies within massive omics datasets, the success of omics sciences to further our understanding of human disease and/or translating these findings to clinical utility remains elusive due to a number of factors. A significant limiting factor is the integration of different omics datasets (i.e., integromics) for extraction of biological and clinical insights. To this end, the National Cancer Institute (NCI) and the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute (NHLBI) organized a joint workshop in June 2012 with the focus on integration issues related to multi-omics technologies that needed to be resolved in order to realize the full utility of integrating omics datasets by providing a glimpse into the disease as an integrated “system”. The overarching goals were to (1) identify challenges and roadblocks in omics integration, and (2) facilitate the full maturation of ‘integromics’ in biology and medicine. Participants reached a consensus on the most significant barriers for integrating omics sciences and provided recommendations on viable approaches to overcome each of these barriers within the areas of technology, bioinformatics and clinical medicine.
