 flagella, given as either a primary or a secondary stimulus into one hind foot-pad. At intervals ranging from 3 min to 3 wk, rats were killed and the popliteal nodes were processed for electron microscopic radioautography using Kodak NTE emulsion. The present paper deals with events in the lymph node medulla, and an accompanying report describes the radically different behavior of antigen in the cortical follicles. In the medulla, lightly labeled granulocytes were transiently encountered, but by far the greatest bulk of antigen was in macrophages. Antigen entered these cells in two ways: by direct penetration of the plasma membrane; and by pinocytosis. In either case, the antigen rapidly became surrounded by tiny vesicles which may have represented Golgi-derived "protolysosomes." Vacuolar fusion ensued and a series of progressively larger and more complex antigen-containing "phagolysosomes" was formed. Substantial amounts of antigen could be detected in such bodies for at least 3 wk. The antigen injection, as expected, caused extensive plasma-cytopoiesis. No evidence of label in plasma cells was obtained. No special anatomic relationship between plasma cells and antigen depot sites was discovered. These results are briefly discussed in relation to current theories of immune induction.
