Psoriasis is a chronic inflammatory skin disease that has a negative impact on psychosocial well-being and cardiometabolic health. Treatment options for moderate-to-severe psoriasis have expanded with the development of interleukin-17 (IL-17) inhibitors, the first of which is now available – secukinumab. Secukinumab is a fully human monoclonal immunoglobulin G1 κ antibody that selectively inhibits the ligand IL-17A. In head-to-head studies, it is more effective than etanercept and ustekinumab, particularly in achieving Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) 90/100 and achieving PASI 50/75 as early as week 4. No head-to-head trials are available for comparison of adalimumab to secukinumab. Significant improvement in health care-related quality of life was also observed using the dermatology quality index in clinical studies. Safety data for secukinumab is comparable to available biologics. Specific safety concerns for the use of secukinumab include its use in patients with inflammatory bowel disease, reversible transient neutropenia, in those with a latex allergy, and the occurrence of mild to moderate oral or genital candidiasis. Secukinumab is an effective and safe treatment option that achieves high clearance rates up to PASI 90 and 100 as monotherapy in cases of moderate-to-severe psoriasis. It may be particularly helpful in patients with psoriasis who have formed antidrug antibodies or failed other biologic agents and in patients with psoriatic arthritis or ankylosing spondylitis.
