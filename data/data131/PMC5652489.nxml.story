Patent foramen ovale (PFO) closure for cryptogenic stroke remains controversial due to a lack of conclusive randomised controlled data. Many experts feel PFO closure is indicated in selected cases; however, national and international guideline recommendations differ. We surveyed the UK cardiologists, stroke physicians and neurologists, seeking to determine specialist interpretation of the evidence base, and to gain an insight into the current UK practice. The British Cardiac Society and British Society of Stroke physicians distributed our survey which was performed using an online platform. 120 physicians (70 stroke physicians, 23 neurologists, 27 cardiologists) completed the survey. Most (89%) felt PFO closure should be considered in selected patients. Atrial fibrillation (86.6%), significant carotid stenosis (86.6%), diabetes (38.4%) and hypertension (36.6%) were considered exclusion criteria for cryptogenic stroke diagnosis. More stroke physicians than cardiologists considered an age cut-off when considering PFO as the stroke aetiology (70.4%vs 54.5%p=0.04). Anatomical features felt to support PFO closure were aneurysmal septum (89.6%), shunt size (73.6%), prominent Eustachian valve (16%). 60% discuss patients in multidisciplinary meetings prior to PFO closure, with more cardiologists than stroke physicians/neurologists favouring this approach (76.9% vs 54.8%; p=0.05). After PFO closure, patients receive Clopidogrel (72.3%), aspirin (50%) or anticoagulants (17%). 63.2% continue therapy for a limited period after PFO closure, while 34% prefer life-long therapy (14.8% cardiologists vs 40.5% non-cardiologists; p=0.02). While experts support selective PFO closure in cryptogenic stroke, current practice remains variable with significant differences in perceptions of cardiologists and neurologists/stroke physicians.
