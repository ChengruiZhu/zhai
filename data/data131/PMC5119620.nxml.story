Recently updated phase III trials revealed the favorable effect of add-on procarbazine-lomustine-vincristine chemotherapy (CT) to radiotherapy (RT) in treating anaplastic oligodendrogliomas with 1p19q codeletion (codel). However, the underlying rationality of deferring RT and upfront CT administration for these tumors is yet to be elucidated. Here, we retrospectively analyzed the long-term outcome of our case series with oligodendroglial tumors treated with deferred RT and upfront procarbazine+nimustine+vincristine (PAV) in the introduction administration. We enrolled 36 patients with newly diagnosed oligodendroglial tumors (17, grade II and 19, grade III) treated during 1999â€“2012 and followed up for a median period of 69.0 months. Their clinical and genetic prognostic factors were analyzed, and progression-free survival, overall survival (OS), and deterioration-free survival (DFS) were evaluated. Regardless of the WHO grade, the 25 patients with 1p19q codel tumors never received RT initially, and of these 25, 23 received PAV treatment upfront. The 75% OS of patients with 1p19q codel tumor was 135.3 months (did not reach the median OS), indicating a favorable outcome. Multivariate analysis revealed that
