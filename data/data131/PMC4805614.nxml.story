Cryoablation has been used for many years as a surgical ablation technique in the prostate and kidney. However, since the introduction of high-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) and robotic surgery for prostate tumours, its popularity in the urologic community has declined. In the early 2000s, innovations in cryoablation technology allowed the use of thinner probes, which were suitable for percutaneous application. As a result, radiologists began using cryoablation, first in the liver, and then in other organs or tissues such as the kidney, lung, breast, pancreas, bone, and soft tissue. In most of these locations, cryoablation has great potential given its inherent advantages, including the use of local anaesthesia, little or no pain during and after the procedure, real-time monitoring of the ablation area on US, CT or MRI, the potential for ablation of large tumours with multiple probes, and the ability to change the shape of the ablation in non-spherical tumours. Yet despite these advantages, the use of percutaneous cryoablation among radiologists appears to be far lower than that of heat-based ablation techniques. The aim of this article is to outline specific aspects of cryoablation and to illustrate its potential clinical applications with case presentations.
