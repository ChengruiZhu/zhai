Almost every aspect of cellular function depends on protein activity. In spite of being fine-tuned to carry out highly specific functions, proteins can also multitask. Experimental studies have identified genes and proteins endowed with more than one molecular function, or participating in very different biological processes. These studies suggest that the degree of functional plasticity exhibited by proteins might go well beyond a simple “one protein—one function” relationship. However, systematic studies of the properties of multifunctional genes (and their encoded proteins) have been limited. Here we present a computational framework to identify putative multifunctional genes, and compare their properties with those of other genes. We find that multifunctional genes are significantly different from other genes with respect to their physicochemical properties, expression profiles, and interaction properties. We also observe that multifunctional genes tend to be more conserved, and that a greater fraction of them are associated with human disorders. Taken together, these results represent a step towards a more complete understanding of the role multifunctional genes play in the functional organization of the cell.
