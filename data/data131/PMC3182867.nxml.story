Many groups of organisms, from colonies of bacteria and social insects through schools of fish and flocks of birds to herds of mammals exhibit advanced collective navigation. Identifying the minimal features of biologically-inspired interacting agents that can lead to emergence of “intelligent” like collective navigation and decision making is fundamental to our understanding of collective behavior, and is of great interest in artificial intelligence and robotics. Previous models of collective behavior of agents, which relied on static interactions of repulsion, orientation (alignment), and attraction, have shown the emergence of collective swarming. Here we show the advantage of performance adaptable interactions for navigation of groups in complex terrains. Each agent senses the local environment and is then allowed to adjust its interactions with the other agents according to its local environment – by decreasing the peers' influence while navigating in a beneficial direction and vice versa. We found that inclusion of such adaptable interactions dramatically improves the collective swarming performance leading to highly efficient navigation especially in very complex terrains.
