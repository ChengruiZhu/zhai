Lymph node status is the most significant prognostic factor of colorectal cancer. However, there is a risk of disease understaging if the extent of lymph node assessment is sub-optimal. Preoperative C-reactive protein (CRP) is known to be a useful tool in predicting postoperative outcomes in patients with colorectal cancer. We retrospectively evaluated whether CRP adds to prognosis information in stage I–III colorectal cancer patients with poor lymph node assessment. In stages I–III, multivariate analysis revealed that CRP-positive status and advanced T-stage were factors that independently affected survival. In stage III, univariate analysis revealed that lymph node number retrieval and lymph node ratio were factors that affected survival. However, CRP positivity was the only independent factor for survival. CRP positivity did not predict poor prognosis in stage II or III patients with adequate lymph node retrieval. By contrast, the prognosis of CRP-positive patients was poorer than that of CRP-negative patients in stage II and III, with inadequate lymph node retrieval. CRP is an independent prognostic marker in patients with stage I–III, II or III colorectal cancer. The evaluation of CRP may provide useful information on prognosis in curative patients with an inadequate examination of lymph nodes.
