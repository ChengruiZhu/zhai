We believed open reduction with internal fixation is required for supination-external rotation ankle fractures located at the level of the distal tibiofibular syndesmosis (Lauge-Hanssen SER II and Weber B) with 2 mm or more fibular fracture displacement. The rationale for surgery for these ankle fractures is based on the notion of elevated intraarticular contact pressures with lateral displacement. To diagnose these injuries, we presumed that in patients with a fibular fracture with at least 2 mm fracture displacement, the lateral malleolus and talus have moved at least 2 mm in a lateral direction without medial displacement of the proximal fibula. We reviewed 55 adult patients treated operatively for a supination-external rotation II ankle fracture (2 mm or more fibular fracture displacement) between 1990 and 1998. On standard radiographs, distance from the tibia to the proximal fibula, distance from the tibia to the distal fibula, and displacement at the level of the fibular fracture were measured. These distances were compared preoperatively and postoperatively. We concluded tibiotalar displacement cannot be reliably assessed at the level of the fracture. Based on this and other studies, we believe there is little evidence to perform open reduction and internal fixation of supination-external rotation II ankle fractures.
