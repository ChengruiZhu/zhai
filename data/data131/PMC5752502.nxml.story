Ectopic Glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) expression plays important role in tumor cell metabolic reprogramming and results in poor prognosis of multiple malignancies. Our previous study indicated that G6PD is overexpressed in clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC), the most common subtype of RCC. However, its role in RCC is still unclear. Here, we demonstrate that G6PD is not only up-regulated in all types of RCC specimens but also displays higher activities in RCC cell lines. G6PD overexpression promoted RCC cell proliferation, altered cell cycle distribution, and enhanced xenografted RCC development. G6PD up-regulated ROS generation by facilitating NADPH-dependent NOX4 activation, which led to increased expression of p-STAT3 and CyclinD1. Enhanced ROS generation rescued the p-STAT3 and CyclinD1 expression reduction in G6PD-knockdown cells, while ROS scavengers reversed the up-regulated p-STAT3 and CyclinD1 expression in G6PD-overexpressing cells. Furthermore, p-STAT3 activated G6PD gene expression via binding to the G6PD promoter, demonstrating that p-STAT3 forms a positive feedback regulatory loop for G6PD overexpression. G6PD expression was up or down-regulated in response to the impact of p-STAT3 activators or inhibitors. Therefore, G6PD may be an effective RCC therapeutic target.
