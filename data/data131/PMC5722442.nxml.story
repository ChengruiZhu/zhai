In CT anatomy‐based inverse treatment planning of interstitial high‐dose rate (HDR) brachytherapy planning, the planning target volume (PTV) delineated by the radiation oncologist includes the applicator volume. The applicator volume can be eliminated with the help of two methods: one based on Boolean operations and the other using the erasing option of the application software. Both methods are compared, and the results are discussed. Elimination of the applicator volume results in the proper estimation of the PTV and the exclusion of the clinically insignificant hot volume from the PTV in the dose‐volume histogram (DVH) analysis. Five cases of prostate cancer are considered for analysis. The PTV, applicator volume, maximum, mean, modal, and minimum dose, and the percentage volume of the PTV structure receiving the percent dose for both cases, that is, with and without applicator volume, are tabulated and analyzed. The elimination of the applicator volume results in the proper volume estimation of the PTV structure and leads to better DVH analysis of interstitial HDR prostate implants. The procedure would have little relevance in routine planning but improves dose reporting. It is too early to conclude its clinical significance or insignificance.
