Lymphocytes provide a limitless repertoire of antigen receptors, but each lymphocyte expresses only one kind of receptor per cell in order to provide specific recognition and response to pathogen invasion. The restriction, called allelic exclusion, operates in tetrapod vertebrates from frogs to human beings. In mouse, immunoglobulin (Ig) heavy chain (H) exclusion depends on ordered activation of component parts of the highly complex, three-megabase IgH locus in a process that differentiates between the two alleles. However, the regulation and mechanisms ensuring allelic exclusion remain uncertain. Sharks represent the earliest vertebrates with an adaptive immune system; their IgH organization, consisting of multiple miniloci, is considered primitive and ancestral to the classical IgH locus in other vertebrates. We show that allelic exclusion nonetheless exists in shark B lymphocytes, although attained by alternative means. Thus, major aspects of the complex pathway described for allelic exclusion in mammals evolved with their IgH organization. Elucidating shared and divergent regulatory processes allows us to gain insight into the basis and evolution of allelic exclusion, which provides the foundation for the functioning of the adaptive immune system.
