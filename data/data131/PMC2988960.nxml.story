Hepatic epithelioid hemangioendothelioma (HEHE) is a rare neoplasm of vascular origin. The clinical presentation of HEHE is variable, and the therapeutic criteria are still unclear since its natural history is unpredictable. A 53-year-old woman was admitted to our hospital because she had a 2.5-cm diameter nodule in the segment V of the liver. She had undergone segmental hepatectomy for solitary HEHE in segment VII 10 years before. There had been no recurrence for the 10 years after the first operation. The tumor was diagnosed as a new lesion of HEHE by percutaneous needle liver biopsy, and thereafter repeated hepatectomy was performed. HEHE seems to be resistant to chemotherapy and radiotherapy. Either surgical resection or orthotopic liver transplantation is generally recommended as a curative treatment for this disease. However, HEHE tends to be detected in multiple lesions, and localized disease is rare. Therefore, the chance of resection is very low. Some reports do not recommend local resection because of early aggressive tumor spread even after curative resection. We herein demonstrate a rare case of HEHE in a patient who underwent repeated hepatectomy for a solitary lesion and who survived for 17 years. It is concluded that surgical resection is one of the most effective treatments for a solitary form of HEHE.
