Segmentation of the vertebrate body axis is established in the embryo by formation of somites, which give rise to the axial muscles (myotome) and vertebrae (sclerotome). To allow a muscle to attach to two successive vertebrae, the myotome and sclerotome must be repositioned by half a segment with respect to each other. Two main models have been put forward: ‘resegmentation’ proposes that each half‐sclerotome joins with the half‐sclerotome from the next adjacent somite to form a vertebra containing cells from two successive somites on each side of the midline. The second model postulates that a single vertebra is made from a single somite and that the sclerotome shifts with respect to the myotome. There is conflicting evidence for these models, and the possibility that the mechanism may vary along the vertebral column has not been considered. Here we use DiI and DiO to trace somite contributions to the vertebrae in different axial regions in the chick embryo. We demonstrate that vertebral bodies and neural arches form by resegmentation but that sclerotome cells shift in a region‐specific manner according to their dorsoventral position within a segment. We propose a ‘resegmentation‐shift’ model as the mechanism for amniote vertebral patterning.
