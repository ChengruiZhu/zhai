Effectively processing information from a sensory scene is essential for animal survival. Motion in a sensory scene complicates this task by dynamically modifying signal properties. To address this general issue, we focus on weakly electric fish. Each fish produces a weak electrical carrier signal with a characteristic frequency. Electroreceptors on its skin encode the modulations of this carrier caused by nearby objects and other animals, enabling this fish to thrive in its nocturnal environment. Little is known about how swimming movements influence natural electrosensory scenes, specifically in the context of detection and identification of, and communication with conspecifics. Using recordings involving free-swimming fish, we characterize the amplitude modulations of the carrier signal arising from small groups of fish. The differences between individual frequencies (beats) are prominent features of these signals, with the number of beats reflecting the number of neighbours. We also find that the distance and motion of a free-swimming fish are represented in a slow modulation of the beat at the receiving fish. Modeling shows that these stimulus features can be effectively encoded in the activity of the electroreceptors, but that encoding quality of some features can be degraded by motion, suggesting that active swimming could hinder conspecific identification.
