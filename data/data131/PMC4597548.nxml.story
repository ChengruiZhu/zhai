A prospective randomized controlled trial was conducted in Division I and Division II NCAA men’s soccer teams during the Fall, 2012 season. Every athletic director, head soccer coach and head athletic trainer from each Divion I and Division II member institution with a men’s collegiate soccer program (N=411) was contacted via a formal letter, email and phone call. Sixty-one member institutions consented to participate. Human ethics review board approval was obtained through Quorum IRB, Seattle, WA, USA. After randomization was completed, the intervention group received an instructional DVD, teaching manual and exercise placards thoroughly describing the FIFA 11+ intervention. An injury surveillance database was utilized (HealtheAthleteTM, Overland Park, Kansas). Every athletic exposure, injury incurred, utilization of the 11+ program and compliance data was entered weekly. Sixty-one institutions completed the study: 34 control institutions (N=850 athletes) and 27 intervention institutions (N=675 athletes). The FIFA 11+ program served as the intervention program over the course of one collegiate season. The warm-up was utilized two to three times per week for the duration of the season.
