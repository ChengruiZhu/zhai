A one-step surgical procedure is presented, including maxillary sinus floor elevation in association with functional endoscopic sinus surgery to remove rhino-sinusal malformations or pathoses that might contraindicate sinus floor elevation. Over a 2-year period, 10 patients requiring a sinus floor augmentation procedure to restore the missing dentition with endosseous implants, but presenting with local and reversible rhinologic contraindications to the augmentation procedure were consecutively treated with a surgical approach that included simultaneously functional endoscopic sinus surgery and a sinus floor elevation procedure through an intra-oral approach. Then 4-6 months after this procedure, oral implants were inserted and after a further waiting period, ranging from 3 to 6 months, patients were restored with prostheses and followed for 1 to 3 years after the completion of prosthetic restoration. In all 10 patients, complete recovery of para-nasal sinuses function was demonstrated and occurred in all cases within one month. All cases showed good integration and consolidation of the graft material used for maxillary sinus floor augmentation. None of the implants placed were lost during the follow-up period after completion of prosthetic loading. In conclusion, despite the limits of this study (which included only 10 patients), the combination of maxillary sinus augmentation procedures and functional endoscopic sinus surgery, to treat local contraindications to sinus augmentation has proven to be both effective and safe and has allowed the patient to avoid a second surgical procedure and a longer waiting period before final prosthetic rehabilitation. No sinusal complications related to sinus floor augmentation were encountered and the survival rate of implants placed in the augmented areas was consistent with those reported in cases of sinus floor augmentation performed in patients presenting with a healthy rhino-sinusal system.
