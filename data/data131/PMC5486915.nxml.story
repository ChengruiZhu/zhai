Although parathyroid hormone (PTH) expresses an anabolic effect on bone mass, the increased bone mass disappears once PTH treatment is withdrawn. Therefore, sequential treatment with anti-bone-resorptive agents is required to maintain bone mass after PTH treatment. We examined the effect of sequential treatment with ibandronate (IBN), a nitrogen-containing bisphosphonate, following PTH in ovariectomized (OVX) rats. Wistar-Imamichi rats (27 weeks old) were ovariectomized and treated with PTH (10 µg/kg, s.c.; 5 times/week; PTH group) for 8 weeks from 8 weeks after OVX. Thereafter, PTH was withdrawn and rats were administered IBN (10 µg/kg, s.c.; every 4 weeks; PTH-IBN group) or vehicle (PTH-Veh group) for another 8 weeks. PTH increased bone mineral density (BMD) measured by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry and biomechanical strength in the lumbar spine and femur as compared to the disease control rats. BMD and biomechanical strength in the PTH-Veh group were lower than in the PTH group, whereas in the PTH-IBN group they were maintained at the level of the PTH group. Microstructure of the trabecular and cortical bone in the PTH-IBN group was not significantly different from that in the PTH group. In histomorphometric analysis of the lumbar vertebra, eroded surface and osteoclast surface in the PTH-Veh group were no different from those in the PTH group, whereas they were lower in the PTH-IBN group. Osteoid surface, osteoblast surface, and mineralize surface decreased in both PTH-IBN and PTH-Veh groups compared to the PTH group, and these parameters in the PTH-IBN group were lower than in the PTH-Veh group. These results indicated that intermittent IBN after PTH treatment suppressed bone turnover and maintained BMD, biomechanical strength, and microstructure in the lumbar spine and femur of OVX rats.
