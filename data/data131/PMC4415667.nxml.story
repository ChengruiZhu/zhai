 using a light microscope. The cycle was divided into a total of 10 stages, according to the morphological characteristics of the cells. The spermatogenetic cells included primary spermatogonia, secondary spermatogonia, primary spermatocytes, secondary spermatocytes, spermatid and sperm. At stage I, the primary spermatogonia was located closer to basal lamina of the seminiferous tubule without spermatocyst formations. Especially at the stage II, the secondary spermatogonia were located in the spermatocyst. The primary and secondary spermatocytes were found from stages III to VI. The secondary spermatocytes were smaller in size than the primary spermatocytes, but they had thicker nucleoplasm and smaller nuclei. The round-shaped, early sperm cells were formed in stage VII, and further divided at stage VIII to have more concentrated nucleoplasm before division to matured sperm cells. At stage X, the matured sperm cells emerged from the spermatocyst. Considering the above results, this study presented the special characteristics in the generation and type of sperm formation. The germ cell formation occurred in various stages, like the perspectives of Franca et al (1999), ultimately, providing taxonomically useful information.
