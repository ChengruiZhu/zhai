Chromosomes encode most of the genetic information necessary for cells to function. When large changes in chromosome structure occur, these changes can lead to a variety of diseases, including cancer. One type of DNA damage that triggers chromosomal changes is a DNA double-strand break. These breaks are often healed correctly by searching the cell for a second undamaged copy of the chromosome and using it as a repair template. However, when breaks occur near DNA sequences that are repeated tens to thousands of times in a genome, these breaks may be healed using a repeat on a different chromosome, leading to a translocation and resulting in the loss or gain of genetic information. In this study, we examine how the extensive processing that normally occurs at double-strand breaks affects the frequency of chromosome rearrangements in yeast. Unexpectedly, we find that limited processing of double-strand breaks leads to more, not fewer, chromosome rearrangements even when breaks occur far from repeated sequences. Furthermore, limited processing allows some cells to duplicate damaged chromosomes resulting in multiple rearrangements from just one break. We discuss possible mechanisms by which these repeats generate rearrangements, as well as how extensive processing of double-strand breaks prevents the accumulation of large-scale mutations.
