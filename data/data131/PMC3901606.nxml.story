We report this case of a 42-year-old woman who presented with a debilitating illness manifested by intractable nausea, vomiting, diarrhea and unchecked weight loss. The patient had multisystem involvement that presented as anemia, abnormal liver function tests and progressively deteriorating renal function necessitating dialysis. She was found to be profoundly hypoalbuminemic secondary to malabsorptive and protein-losing enteropathy in tandem with nephrotic range proteinuria. Intolerance to enteral feeding led the patient to be dependent on parenteral nutrition. Serum immunofixation revealed IgG lambda monoclonal protein. The patient underwent endoscopic evaluation with biopsies taken from the gastrointestinal tract that confirmed the diagnosis of primary systemic light-chain amyloidosis. A subsequent bone marrow biopsy revealed normocellular bone marrow with deposition of amyloid. The patient was not considered for autologous stem cell transplantation as the outcomes in patients with multisystem involvement are often poor, with a high mortality risk. Diffuse primary systemic light-chain amyloidosis involving the gastrointestinal tract is a rare entity and is to be considered among differentials in patients presenting with unexplained malabsorptive symptoms.
