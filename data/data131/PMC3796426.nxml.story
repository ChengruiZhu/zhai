For solid tumors of a malignant origin, the expression of the nm23-H1 gene is a positive prognostic factor. However, for chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), the prognostic role of nm23-H1 gene expression is unknown. The present study investigated the impact of nm23-H1 gene expression on the proliferation and migration of the CML K562 cell line to elucidate the association between nm23-H1 gene expression and CML cell survival. An RNAi lipo-recombinant plasmid of the nm23-H1 gene (pGCsi-nm23-H1) was constructed and transfected into the K562 cells. RT-PCR and western blotting were used to detect nm23-H1 mRNA and protein expression, respectively. The anchorage-independent growth ability of the transfected cells was observed in soft agar culture and the ability of the K562 cells to migrate was determined using a Transwell assay. Following the successful construction and transfection of the pGCsi-nm23-H1 plasmid into the K562 cells, nm23-H1 mRNA and protein expression levels were significantly lower compared with the control group. The stably-transfected pGCsi-nm23-H1 K562 cells exhibited a markedly increased ability to form colonies and the number and sizes of the colonies were significantly increased compared with those of the control.
