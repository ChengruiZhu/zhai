 When blood plasma proteins are depleted by bleeding with return of the washed red blood cells (plasmapheresis) it is possible to bring dogs to a steady state of hypoproteinemia and a uniform plasma protein production on a basal low protein diet. These dogs are clinically normal. By the introduction of variables into their standardized existence insight into the formation of plasma proteins can be obtained. The liver basal diet maintains health in such hypoproteinemic dogs during periods as long as a year. 17 to 27 per cent of its protein content (entirely liver protein) is presumably converted into plasma protein. Gelatin alone added to the liver basal diet causes very little if any extra plasma protein production. The addition to gelatin of cystine, or tyrosine, or tryptophane, or of both tyrosine and tryptophane has little or no effect on its potency for plasma protein production. When gelatin is supplemented by cystine and either tryptophane or tyrosine, 25 to 40 per cent of the protein content of the combination is converted into plasma proteinâ€”an efficiency equaling that of any protein hitherto tested. Preliminary experiments indicate that methionine cannot substitute for cystine nor can phenylalanine substitute for tyrosine in the efficient combination of gelatin plus cystine plus tyrosine. Laked red blood cells given by vein afford little or no material for plasma protein formation. When the
