 conjugate of the hapten combined with a heterologous protein such as dinitrophenyl-hen egg albumin (DNP·HEA), an immune response similar to that in the controls occurred both to the hapten and to the protein carrier. However, when the tolerant animals were sensitized with a conjugate containing a homologous protein carrier such as dinitrophenyl guinea pig serum (DNP·GPS), they showed diminished immune responses in comparison with those in the non-tolerant controls. The presence of circulating anti-DNP antibodies from sensitization with DNP-HEA did not affect the unresponsiveness to the specific contact hapten, regardless of whether these antibodies are present before or after induction of tolerance. Sensitization with picryl chloride (PiCl) (a cross-reacting hapten), either before or after gastric feeding of DCB, did not affect the state of unresponsiveness to DNP. Similarly when the DNP-tolerant animal was sensitized with PiCl, the subsequent immune response was similar to that in the controls; cross-reactions with the DNP group both in the contact and circulating antibody phase occurred at a rate similar to that in the controls. The foregoing relationships can be explained by presuming that, upon the gastric feeding of DCB, an
