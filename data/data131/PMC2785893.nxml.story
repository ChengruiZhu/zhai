This review integrates recent understanding of a novel role for NDPK-A in two related directions: Firstly, its role in an airway epithelial cell when bound to the luminal (apical) membrane and secondly in the cytosol of many different cells (epithelial and non-epithelial) where an isoform-specific interaction occurs with a regulatory partner, AMPKα1. Thus NDPK-A is present in both a membrane and cytosolic environment but in the apical membrane, its roles are not understood in detail; preliminary data suggest that it co-localises with the cystic fibrosis protein (CFTR). In cytosol, we find that NDPK-A is coupled to the catalytic alpha1 isoform of the AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPKα subunit), which is part of a heterotrimeric protein complex that responds to cellular energy status by switching off ATP-consuming pathways and switching on ATP-generating pathways when ATP is limiting. We find that ATP is located within this complex and ‘fed’ from NDPK to AMPK without ever ‘seeing’ bulk solution. Importantly, the reverse can also happen such that AMPK activity can be made to decline when NDPK-A ‘steals’ ATP from AMPK. Thus we propose a novel paradigm in NDPK-A function by suggesting that AMP-kinase can be regulated by NDPK-A, independently of AMP.
