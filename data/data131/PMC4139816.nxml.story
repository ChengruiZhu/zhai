Background: mast cells play an important role in airway inflammation in asthma. The transient receptor potential melastatin-like 7 (TRPM7) channel is expressed in primary human lung mast cells and plays a critical role for cell survival. This study aimed to investigate the role of TRPM7 on degranulation and release of cytokines in rat bone marrow-derived mast cells (BMMCs). Methods: the expression levels of TRPM7 were observed by immunocytochemistry and RT-PCR between normal and asthmatic rat BMMCs. TRPM7-specific shRNA and 2-aminoethoxydiphenyl borate (2-APB) and specific shTRPM7 were used to inhibit the function of TRPM7. Degranulation levels were analyzed by beta-hexosaminidase assay. Histamine, TNF-α, IL-6 and IL-13 levels were measured by ELISA. Results: the expression of TRPM7 was significantly higher in asthmatic rat BMMCs than in the normal control group. After application of 2-APB and down-regulation of TRPM7, the beta-hexosaminidase activity and secretion of histamine, IL-6, IL-13 and TNF-α were significantly decreased in the asthmatic group compared to the control group. Conclusion: this study indicates that TRPM7 channels may be involved in the process of degranulation and release of cytokines in rat bone marrow-derived mast cells.
