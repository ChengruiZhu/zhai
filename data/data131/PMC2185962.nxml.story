We recently reported the isolation of a rat monoclonal antibody designated 2.4G2 (9) that is directed against the mouse trypsin- resistant Fc receptor (FcR) for IgG2b and IgG1 immune aggregates. We have now utilized the Fab fragment of 2.4G2 as an affinity reagent to purify FcR from the macrophage cell line J774 to apparent homogeneity. The antigen isolated from J774 cells consisted of two general types of polypeptides with broad electrophoretic mobilities of approximately 60,000 and 47,000 mol wt. Similar broad bands ranging from 47,000 to 70,000 mol wt were isolated from various FcR-bearing cell lines of B, T, and null lymphocyte, as well as of macrophage origin. J774 FcR was judged to be a glycoprotein based on the sensitivity of its isoelectric point to neuraminidase digestion, its labeling with galactose oxidase/NaB[3H4], and its binding to concanavalin A-Sepharose. In phosphate-buffered saline, the isolated protein formed large aggregates that were shown to retain FcR activity, albeit with a somewhat altered IgG subclass specificity. The FcR aglutinated erythrocytes that were coated with both IgG2b and IgG2a that did not otherwise hemagglutinate. In addition, iodinated FcR bound to Sephadex beads coated with rabbit IgG, mouse IgG1, IgG2b, and IgG2a, but not to beads coated with mouse IgG3 or rabbit F(ab')2 fragments. The binding of the purified receptor to all IgG classes was inhibited by the Fab fragments of 2.4G2. In contrast, the binding of IgG2a to intact macrophages was inhibited by 2.4G2 Fab by only 15%, whereas rabbit IgG immune aggregate binding was almost completely abolished.
