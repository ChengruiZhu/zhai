Limulus ventral photoreceptors were voltage clamped to the resting (dark) potential and stimulated by a 20-ms test flash and a 1-s conditioning flash. At a constant level of adaptation, we measured the response to the test flash given in the dark (control) and the incremental response produced when the test flash occurred within the duration of the conditioning flash. The incremental response is defined as the response to the conditioning and test flashes minus the response to the conditioning flash given alone. When the test flash was presented within 100 ms after the onset of the conditioning flash we observed that: (a) for dim conditioning flashes the incremental response equaled the control response; (b) for intermediate intensity conditioning flashes the incremental response was greater than the control response (we refer to this as enhancement); (c) for high intensity conditioning flashes the incremental response nearly equaled the control response. Using 10-Î¼m diam spots of illumnination, we stimulated two spatially separate regions of one photoreceptor. When the test flash and the conditioning flash were presented to the same region, enhancement was present; but when the flashes were applied to separate regions, enhancement was nearly absent. This result indicates that enhancement is localized to the region of illumination. We discuss mechanisms that may account for enhancement.
