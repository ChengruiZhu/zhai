. The present study evaluated the synergistic cytotoxic effects of PE and CDDP against human cervical cancer. Combination therapy of PE with CDDP exhibited synergistic cytotoxicity towards CaSki cell growth in mouse xenograft tumors. PE exhibited a cytotoxic effect on tumor size and weight, although the inhibitory ratio of tumor weight was only 26.3% in the PE-treated group. However, when mice were co-treated with PE and CDDP, the inhibitory ratio was higher than that of mice treated with CDDP alone (50.8 vs. 68.4%, respectively). The potential synergistic mechanism was likely via inhibiting the signaling E6/p53 pathway, restoring p53 function and inducing downstream tumor suppressor chain effects on apoptosis. Western blot analysis and immunohistochemistry indicated thatE6protein expression was significantly decreased upon treatment with combined PE and CDDP. The expression of p53 was increased in the combined PE and CDDP treatment group. Upregulation of p53-dependent apoptosis-associated proteins, including Bcl-2-associated X protein and cleaved caspases-9 and âˆ’3, was observed in the combined PE and CDDP treatment group. Our results present a molecular basis for the future application of the combination of PE and CDDP in the treatment of cervical cancer as a novel and pharmacologically safe chemotherapeutic strategy.
