A critical protein in cell-signalling pathways, called protein kinase B, regulates many aspects of cell biology from metabolism to proliferation and survival, by modifying other proteins with the addition of a phosphate group. Hence, deregulation of its activity has acute consequences on cell function. Increased activity of a tumour-promoting form of protein kinase B or of upstream regulatory proteins has been observed in tumours, while impaired protein kinase B function has been linked to diabetes. Therefore, understanding the molecular mechanism of protein kinase B activation will help reveal how its activity might be regulated to limit disease progression. Toward this end, we studied how protein kinase B structure relates to its function, to identify molecular mechanisms regulating its kinase activity, modifying its cellular localization, and altering its binding to other proteins. By determining the spatial organization of different regions of the protein in inactive protein kinase B, we discovered a cavity at the interface of two distinct functional regions of the inactive form. We also localized the C-terminal end of the protein to the apex of the cavity, suggesting a role of this domain in regulating the inactive form of the protein. This represents a novel example of negative regulation by inhibition across these different regions of the protein. From these findings, we elucidated the mechanism of action of a highly specific protein kinase B inhibitor, AKT inhibitor VIII. We determined that simultaneous binding of the inhibitor to the two different functional regions, through the cavity, “locks” protein kinase B in an inactive conformation and prevents regulatory proteins from accessing the C-terminal domain.
