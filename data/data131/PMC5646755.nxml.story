A central and recurring feature of cell-fate regulating circuits is their ability to generate bimodal expression—2 alternate expression states that exist simultaneously—with each state corresponding to a different cell fate. To understand the mechanisms enabling bimodality in a natural decision-making circuit, we examined HIV’s fate-selection circuit, the Tat circuit. This bimodal circuit is sufficient and necessary to generate a bet-hedging decision between 2 alternate HIV fates: active viral replication and long-lived dormancy (proviral latency). The dormant state, which is resistant to most antiviral drugs, is the primary clinical barrier to curing an HIV infection. While the canonical role of positive feedback is to amplify a signal, surprisingly, we find that the HIV transactivator of transcription (Tat) positive-feedback architecture is instead optimized to expand the regime of HIV expression bimodality. From an evolutionary perspective, the results suggest that positive-feedback circuits may have evolved to robustly generate bimodality in certain contexts, and, given the rapid evolution of HIV, the presence of a circuit optimized to robustly generate bimodal expression patterns appears to support the hypothesis that HIV’s active-versus-latent decision confers viral fitness.
