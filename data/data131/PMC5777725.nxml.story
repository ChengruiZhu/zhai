HSP70 connects multiple signaling pathways that work synergistically to protect tumor cells from death by proteotoxic stress and represents a possible target to establish a new approach for multiple myeloma treatment. Therefore, bioluminescent cell lines RPMI8226-LUC-PURO and U266-LUC-PURO were treated with HSP70 (VER155008) and/or proteasome (bortezomib) inhibitors and immunodeficient mice were used for subcutaneous xenograft models to evaluate tumor growth reduction and tumor growth inhibition after treatment. Bioluminescence imaging was used to follow tumor response. Treatment with bortezomib showed ∼60% of late apoptosis in RPMI8226-LUC-PURO (without additional benefit of VER155008 in this cell line). However, U266-LUC-PURO showed ∼60% of cell death after treatment with VER155008 (alone or with bortezomib). RPMI8226-LUC-PURO xenograft presented tumor reduction by bioluminescence imaging after treatment with bortezomib, VER155008 or drug combination compared to controls. Treatment with bortezomib, alone or combined with VER155008, showed inhibition of tumor growth assessed by bioluminescence imaging after one week in both RPMI8226-LUC-PURO and U266-LUC-PURO cell lines when compared to controls. In conclusion, our study shows that the combination of proteasome and HSP70 inhibitors induced cell death in tumor cells
