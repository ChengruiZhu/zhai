The effect of N-ethylmaleimide (NEM), a sulphydryl alkylating agent, on the acetylcholine-activated K+ current, IK(ACh), has been studied in single cells from bullfrog atrium using a tight-seal, whole-cell voltage clamp technique. Addition of NEM (5 x 10(-5) M) produced a time- dependent complete block of IK(ACh). Dialysis of guanosine-5'-O-(3- thiotriphosphate) (GTP gamma S, 5-10 x 10(-4) M), a nonhydrolyzable GTP analogue, into the myoplasm from the recording pipette gradually activated IK(ACh) even in the absence of acetylcholine. This effect is thought to be due to a GTP gamma S-induced dissociation of GTP-binding proteins (Gi and/or Go) into subunits that can directly activate these K+ channels. When NEM (5 x 10(-5) M) was applied after the GTP gamma S effect had fully developed, it failed to inhibit the GTP gamma S- induced K+ current, indicating that the NEM effect is unlikely to be on the dissociated subunits of the GTP-binding protein(s) or on the K+ channels. In contrast, pretreatment with NEM before GTP gamma S application markedly reduced the muscarinic K+ current, suggesting that NEM can block this K+ current by inhibition of the dissociation of the GTP-binding proteins into functional subunits. In NEM-treated cells the stimulatory effect of isoproterenol on ICa was present, but the inhibitory action of ACh on ICa was completely abolished. These results demonstrated that NEM can preferentially inhibit muscarinic receptor- effector interactions, probably by alkylating the GTP-binding proteins that are essential for these responses.
