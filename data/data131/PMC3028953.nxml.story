Heart failure is a common cardiovascular disease with high morbidity and mortality. Unlike western countries where heart failure is predominantly a disease of the elderly, in India it affects younger age group. Important risk factors include coronary artery disease, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, valvular heart disease and cardiomyopathies. Plasma brain natriuretic peptide levels are helpful in the diagnosis of heart failure. Echocardiography is the primary imaging modality of choice, through recently cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has been found to play an increasing role. Aim of management is to improve symptoms & enhance survival. Diuretics are important in relieving symptoms. Beta-blockers, angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers and adosterone antagonists improve survival in patients with impaired systolic function. Device therapy including cardiac resynchronization therapy and implantable cardiac defibrillators, though expensive are useful in selected patients. Unlike in patients with systolic heart failure where several therapies have been shown to improve survival, clinical trial results in diastolic heart failure have been disappointing and therapy in these patients is restricted to symptom improvement and risk factor control. Therapies like stem cell therapy are being evaluated in clinical trials and appear promising. Early diagnosis and appropriate therapy helps in reversing the process of remodelling and clinical improvement in most of the patients.
