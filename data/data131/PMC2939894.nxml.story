Here, we present data indicating that the family member ADAM8 plays a role in thymic T cell development. We used qrtPCR on FACS sorted thymic subsets together with immunofluorescene to analyze thymic ADAM8 expression. We found that ADAM8 was expressed in murine thymic stromal cells and at lower levels in thymocytes where its expression increased as cell matured, suggesting involvement of ADAM8 in thymopoiesis. Further flow cytometry analysis revealed that ADAM8 deficient mice showed normal development and expansion of immature thymocyte subsets. There was however an intrathymic accumulation of single positive CD4 and CD8 T cells which was most noticeable in the late mature T cell subsets. Accumulation of single positive T cells coincided with changes in the thymic architecture manifest in a decreased cortex/medulla ratio and an increase in medullary epithelial cells as determined by histology and flow cytometry. The increase in single positive T cells was thymus-intrinsic, independent of progenitor homing to the thymus or thymic exit rate of mature T cells. Chemotaxis assays revealed that ADAM8 deficiency was associated with reduced migration of single positive thymocytes towards CCL21.
