 mutations are found in testicular cancer (TC), chemotherapy resistance is still observed in a significant subgroup of TC patients. In the present study, we demonstrate that p53 resides in a complex with MDM2 at higher cisplatin concentrations in cisplatin-resistant human TC cells compared with cisplatin-sensitive TC cells. Inhibition of the MDM2–p53 interaction using either Nutlin-3 or MDM2 RNA interference resulted in hyperactivation of the p53 pathway and a strong induction of apoptosis in cisplatin-sensitive and -resistant TC cells. Suppression of wild-type p53 induced resistance to Nutlin-3 in TC cells, demonstrating the key role of p53 for Nutlin-3 sensitivity. More specifically, our results indicate that p53-dependent induction of Fas membrane expression (∼threefold) and enhanced Fas/FasL interactions at the cell surface are important mechanisms of Nutlin-3-induced apoptosis in TC cells. Importantly, an analogous Fas-dependent mechanism of apoptosis upon Nutlin-3 treatment is executed in wild-type p53 expressing Hodgkin lymphoma and acute myeloid leukaemia cell lines. Finally, we demonstrate that Nutlin-3 strongly augmented cisplatin-induced apoptosis and cell kill via the Fas death receptor pathway. This effect is most pronounced in cisplatin-resistant TC cells.
