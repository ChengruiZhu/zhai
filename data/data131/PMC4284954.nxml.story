This study was conducted to determine the malariometric indices of children in three different settings in Ibadan, Nigeria. Children were recruited from an urban slum (Oloomi) and a periurban (Sasa) and a rural community (Igbanda) in Ibadan. Children aged between 2 and 10 years were randomly selected from primary schools in the urban and periurban areas. In the rural community, children were recruited from the centre of the village. A total of 670 (55.0%) out of 1218 children recruited were positive for malaria parasitaemia. The urban population had the highest proportion of children with malaria parasitaemia. Splenomegaly was present in 31.5%, hepatomegaly in 41.5%, hepatosplenomegaly in 27.5%, and anaemia in 25.2% of the children. The parasite density was not significantly different among children in the three communities. Children in the rural community had the highest mean PCV of 34.2% and the lowest rates of splenomegaly (6.1%), hepatomegaly (7.6%), and hepatosplenomegaly (4.6%). The spleen rates, liver rates, and presence of hepatosplenomegaly and anaemia were similar in the urban and periurban communities. The malariometric indices among the asymptomatic carriers were high, especially in the urban slum. This stresses the need for intensified efforts at controlling the disease in the study area.
