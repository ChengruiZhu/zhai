The movement strategies of bacteria have received increasing attention over the past decade, in particular with respect to the tracking of individual cells and the mathematical description of the resulting trajectories. Bacteria typically move in almost straight runs interrupted by sharp turning events (run-and-tumble). In order to characterize their motion on a single cell level, the tumble events in individual trajectories have to be identified. Traditionally, tumble recognition relies on threshold values that are applied to the swimming speed and the reorientation angle. They are chosen in an ad hoc fashion and introduce a certain degree of arbitrariness to the results of statistical motion analyses. Here, we propose a new stochastic model for the orientation angle of a bacterium and formulate conditonal moments, which we determine both in theory and from experimental trajectories. This provides an alternative way of quantifying the bacterial run-and-tumble strategy and of recognizing tumble events. Our approach no longer relies on arbitrarily chosen segmentation thresholds and rigorously quantifies the uncertainty in tumble recognition. We successfully apply our method not only to the paradigmatic case of
