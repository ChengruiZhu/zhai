 contains a TF that prevents it from making enzymes that degrade lactose when lactose is absent. Bacterial genomes encode a huge diversity of TFs, and except in a few well-studied organisms, the function of these TFs is not known. To predict the function of a TF, biologists often search for a similar TF, from another organism, that has been characterized. It is generally believed that orthologous TFs—TFs that are derived from the organisms' common ancestor—will have conserved functions. The authors show that a commonly used method to identify orthologous TFs gives misleading results when applied to distantly related bacteria: the “orthologous” TFs are evolutionarily distant, they sense different signals, and they regulate different pathways. Biologists often predict, more specifically, that orthologous TFs will regulate orthologous genes. However, the authors show that even in more closely related bacteria, where the orthologous TFs do have conserved functions, these specific predictions are often incorrect. It seems that gene regulation in bacteria evolves rapidly, and it will be difficult to predict regulation in diverse bacteria from our knowledge of a few well-studied bacteria.
