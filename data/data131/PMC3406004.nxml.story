In this computational study, we have examined, for the first time, the potential effects of a drug-metabolizing enzyme on drug pharmacokinetics in human, showing that a high-activity drug-metabolizing enzyme can completely/effectively prevent the drug of abuse from entering brain to produce physiological effects. Based on this encouraging insight, it is feasible to develop enzyme therapies for drugs of abuse. Through pharmacokinetic modeling, we have demonstrated that, without an exogenous enzyme, the drug half-lives in both brain and plasma are almost linearly dependent on the initial drug concentration in plasma. This finding indicates that one may not simply say the half-life of a drug without clearly indicating the actual dose condition. We have also demonstrated for the first time how a high-activity drug-metabolizing enzyme can considerably decrease the peak concentration of drug in brain and drug half-lives in both brain and plasma. In addition, we have calculated the minimum (threshold) concentration of cocaine in brain required to produce physiological effects. The predicted threshold concentration, along with all of the general insights obtained in this study, will provide a rational base for future design of further experimental studies required for the enzyme therapy development.
