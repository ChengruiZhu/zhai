Heritable phenotypic properties are often defined by complex pathways and therefore dependent on multiple polymorphisms affecting different genes. Mapping phenotypic consequences of such genetic variation is central to our understanding of disease susceptibility and is fundamental to understanding evolutionary dynamics. How does the effect of multiple genetic polymorphisms occurring together relate to the effect of same polymorphisms in isolation? It is often assumed that individual effects add without interference, yet interactions between polymorphisms have been observed in numerous contexts. The extent to which interactions shape phenotype distributions depends on the nature of interaction intrinsic to the biological system and on the distribution of polymorphisms in the population. Here we approach the systems aspect of the problem by using quantitative modeling of a moderately complex bio-molecular pathway - invertebrate phototransduction - to provide a statistical characterization of non-additive effects of multiple parameter changes. We find that interaction is associated with small subsets of polymorphisms and demonstrate that focusing the study on the set of strong additive polymorphisms accounts also for a significant fraction of total interaction: a finding relevant to the genome-wide-association analysis.
