The prevalence of congenital cystic adenomatoid malformation among fetuses still varies in different studies in China. The present meta-analysis was intended to evaluate the pooled prevalence of fetuses in China. Four English (Pubmed, Elsevier Science Direct, Web of Science and the Cochrane Library) and four Chinese (the Chinese Biological Medical Literature database, the Chinese National Knowledge Infrastructure database, VIP database and Wanfang Data) databases were searched from inception to July 2016. Meta-analyses were performed using Stata (version 12.0), with prevalence and corresponding 95% confidence intervals using the random effect model. Five studies with 393496 fetuses were chosen for this meta-analysis. The overall pooled prevalence was 4.01/10000 (2.03/10000 - 6.00/10000) fetuses. Sensitivity analysis revealed that the results were stable, and Begg’s test and Egg’s test showed no potential risk of publication bias. This is, to our knowledge, the first study to systematically evaluate the literature of the prevalence of congenital cystic adenomatoid malformation among fetuses in China. Results showed that the prevalence among fetuses should be considerable. A large-scale multicenter study on the epidemiology across different areas in China is required.
