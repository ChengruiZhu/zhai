Secreted protein acidic and rich in cysteine (SPARC) plays key roles in erythropoiesis; haploinsufficiency of SPARC is implicated in the progression of the 5q- syndrome. However, the role of SPARC in other subtypes of myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) is not fully understood, particularly in the del(5q) type with a complex karyotype, which has a high risk to transform into acute myeloid leukemia (AML). In the present study, we investigated the role of SPARC in the proliferation and apoptosis of SKM-1 cells, an acute myeloid leukemia cell line transformed from an MDS cell line. SKM-1 cells were infected with SPARC-RNAi-LV or NC-GFP-LV lentivirus. Apoptosis and cell cycle profiling were assessed by flow cytometry, and cell proliferation was evaluated by MTS assay. The mRNA and protein expression levels of SPARC, p53, caspase-3, caspase-9 and Fas were detected by RT-PCR, real-time PCR and western blot assay. The SPARC shRNA constructed by us led to a significant reduction in SPARC expression in SKM-1 cells. SPARC knockdown inhibited the proliferation of SKM-1 cells by inducing cell cycle arrest at the G1/G0 phase and apoptosis. SPARC knockdown elevated the expression of p53, caspase-9, caspase-3 and Fas at both the mRNA and protein levels. SPARC silencing inhibited the growth of AML transformed from MDS by activating p53-induced apoptosis and cell cycle arrest. These data indicate that SPARC acts as an oncogene in transformed MDS/AML and is a potential therapeutic target in MDS/AML.
