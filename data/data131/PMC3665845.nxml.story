A long-standing paradox in the study of infectious diseases is why pathogens evolve to cause harm to the very hosts they depend on to survive and reproduce. Research over several decades suggests that this harm, or virulence, is an inevitable by-product of the pathogen replication needed to maximize the chance that a given pathogen will be transmitted to another host. Here we demonstrate that a recently emerged bacterial pathogen of a North American songbird species has gradually become more virulent during each of two emergence events in different regions of the host range. This evolution of higher virulence appears to have been driven by selection for high rates of pathogen replication, because bacterial isolates that are more virulent in finches also attain the highest loads in infected host tissues. Overall, our results indicate that emerging pathogens can evolve to become more virulent in their hosts, at least in the short term, when an increase in the pathogen's ability to replicate is linked with higher virulence. Our findings have important implications for understanding and predicting the severity of disease caused by emerging pathogens in wildlife, domestic animals, and humans.
