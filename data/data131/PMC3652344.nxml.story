This is a case series in which a new technique for the surgical treatment of periodontal recessions is presented along with the results of the first clinical trial. A new technique of periodontal flap surgery was performed on 30 patients with severe periodontal recessions of the upper or lower front teeth. Root and soft tissue scaling was carried out with an open approach, then the periosteum was incised and mobilized at the apical part of the mucoperiosteum flap to cover the defect before the mucoperiosteum was reattached and fixed by sutures. Sulcus bleeding, periodontal probing depths, attachment loss and the length of the attached gingiva of the affected teeth were recorded preoperatively and at 3, 6, and 12 months postoperatively. Every clinical parameter was improved by surgery. No sulcus bleeding was observed at any time during the postoperative follow-up. A mean reattachment of 5.5 mm was noticed 12 months postoperatively at a mean probing depth of 0.3 mm. The mean height of the attached gingiva was 0 mm before surgery, 2.3 mm at three and six months postoperatively, and 2.2 mm at 12 months. The periosteum eversion technique is suitable for the treatment of gingival recessions resulting in good gingival function and a clear improvement in aesthetics.
