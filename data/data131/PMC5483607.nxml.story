The effect of housing on rodent well-being has received increasing scrutiny in recent years in North America in an attempt to define adequate standards of animal care. Typically, the adequacy of cage size is determined by species and body weight, with little consideration being given to the cage complexity and impact on animal welfare. Further, most studies evaluate different caging methods over relatively short periods of time, which may not be realistic for typical colony settings. Inappropriate housing may lead to boredom, aggression, and the development of abnormal behaviour and function, which in turn may affect animal responses during research protocols. In this study, we evaluated the impact of group housing rats by sex in double wide cages with the addition of polyvinyl chloride (PVC) tubes for shelter, a nylon chew toy, and a piece of food enrichment given three times weekly over the course of five months. These groups were compared to rats that were single or pair-housed by sex in standard cages provided only with a nylon chew toy. We found that group-housed rats were more active and continued to engaged in positive social behaviours, such as grooming, for the duration of the study, with minimal impact on other aspects of animal function.
