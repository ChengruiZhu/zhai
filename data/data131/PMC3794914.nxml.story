A better understanding of protein interaction networks would be a great aid in furthering our knowledge of the molecular biology of the cell. Towards this end, large-scale protein-protein physical interaction data have been determined for organisms across the evolutionary spectrum. However, the resulting networks give a static view of interactomes, and our knowledge about protein interactions is rarely time or context specific. A previous prominent but controversial attempt to characterize the dynamic modularity of the interactome was based on integrating physical interaction data with gene activity measurements from transcript expression data. This analysis distinguished between proteins that are co-expressed with their interacting partners and those that are not, and argued that the former are intramodular and the latter are intermodular. By analyzing the interactomes of five organisms, we largely confirm the biological significance of this characterization through a variety of statistical tests and computational experiments. Surprisingly, however, we find that similar results can be obtained using just network information without additionally integrating expression data, suggesting that purely topological characteristics of interaction networks strongly reflect certain aspects of the dynamics and modularity of interactomes.
