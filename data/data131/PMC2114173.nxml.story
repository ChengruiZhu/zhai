Two conditions were identified that interfered with the complex polymerization process in biosynthesis of von Willebrand factor (vWf). Treatment of human umbilical vein endothelial cells with tunicamycin inhibited N-linked glycosylation of nascent vWf and the resulting pro- vWf monomers failed to dimerize. The single subunits accumulated in the endoplasmic reticulum and were neither processed further nor secreted. In the presence of a weak base (ammonium chloride or chloroquine), interdimer disulfide bond formation was inhibited in a dose-dependent manner. This process appeared therefore to be pH sensitive and likely to be initiated in the acidic trans-Golgi apparatus (Anderson, R. G. W., and R. K. Pathak, 1985, Cell, 40: 635-643). The weak base had no obvious effect on the other processing steps, i.e. dimerization, complex carbohydrate formation and sulfation, and produced only slight inhibition of prosequence cleavage. On the other hand, the weak base interfered with the targeting of newly synthesized vWf into Weibel- Palade bodies, with all of the vWf being secreted constitutively and none stored in the Weibel-Palade bodies. In summary, initial glycosylation of the nascent vWf protein and low pH in the trans-Golgi apparatus were important conditions for the successful polymerization of human vWf. Genetic defects disrupting any one of these conditions could result in the phenotype of von Willebrand disease.
