Platelets are blood cells that, upon injury, trigger the blood to clot. Following blood vessel damage platelets encounter the extracellular matrix protein collagen to which they respond. They become activated, aggregating to form a major component of blood clots. The platelet collagen receptor GPVI stimulates platelet activation through a complex signalling pathway, and while many of the molecules involved in the activation of this pathway have been identified, their specific roles in determining the rate and extent of the exceptionally rapid platelet response have not been determined. Furthermore, while signalling proteins responsible for forward reactions are known, reverse or negative feedback elements are not well understood. Platelets also trigger thrombosis in diseased arteries, causing heart attacks and strokes, and therefore platelets, and particularly the GPVI signalling pathway, are therapeutic targets. To begin to understand the components in the GPVI signalling pathways that may represent tractable therapeutic targets we have developed a mathematical model of the key initiating events that occur upon stimulation of GPVI. In so doing, we have established the importance of a specific phosphatase-controlled negative feedback in determining the rate of initiation of platelet activation.
