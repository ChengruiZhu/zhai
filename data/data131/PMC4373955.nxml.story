The formation of myelin, a fatty, multilayered structure that surrounds certain neuronal axons in the nervous system, is essential for the proper communication of electrical signals by neurons, acting both as an insulator and to promote metabolic support to the axon. Loss of myelin can have severe functional consequences and trigger serious diseases, such as multiple sclerosis. Bidirectional communication between the oligodendrocytes, the myelinating cells of the central nervous system, and the axon is essential for the proper formation and function of myelin membranes; however, the signals that control myelination by oligodendrocytes in the central nervous system are poorly understood. In this paper, we use a combination of cell culture and animal studies to demonstrate that the protein Scribble, which is known to be a highly evolutionarily conserved regulator of cell polarity, plays a role in controlling whether oligodendrocytes myelinate axons. We show that Scribble regulates the length and thickness of myelin sheaths formed, as well as the tight adhesion of oligodendroglial membranes to the axonal surface, which is required for the organization of the axon into specialized domains at the nodes of Ranvier (gaps formed between the myelin sheaths generated by different cells). In addition, we show that Scribble plays a key role in the repair of myelin sheaths in a mouse model of demyelinating disease. The discovery of novel regulators of myelination in the central nervous system may allow for the identification of novel therapeutic targets for the promotion of myelin repair in patients suffering from demyelinating diseases.
