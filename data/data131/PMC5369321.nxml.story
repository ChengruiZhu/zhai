Purpose: The goal of this study is to identify the predictive factors involved in the evolution of the reactive arthritis to ankylosing spondylitis by following the presence and degree of sacroiliitis and also the appeareance of acute anterior uveitis.Material and Methods: The study was performed between 01.01.2011- 31.12.2014 on 112 patients, aged between 17 and 47 years old, in evidence of the Rheumatology Clinic of the Clinical Hospital Emergency Craiova. The patients were divided in 2 lots according to the radiological criteria: the first lot included 52 patients diagnosed with reactive arthritis, with the determination of the pathogen agent involved and the demonstration of sacroiliitis first degree by Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (IRM). The second lot included a number of 60 patients diagnosed with reactive arthritis, without presenting significant changes in the sacroiliac joints and at the cervico-dorsal- lumbar spine. Results: In the first batch, the performance of the IRM and monitoring the patients every 6 months over 3 years revealed the progression of sacroiliitis from first degree in which it was at the moment of diagnosing at second degree in a 6 month period. Three years after initiation of therapy for reactive arthritis, the patients from the second batch responded favorably to treatment, the performance of imaging not revealing signs of sacroiliitis.Conclusion: Association of sacroiliitis at baseline proved to be a negative prognostic factor in reactive arthritis, which can suggest the evolution to ankylosing spondylitis, monitoring these patients being necessary for at least 3 years from the point of diagnosing.
