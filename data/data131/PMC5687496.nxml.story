Lipid nanocapsules (LNCs) are potential drug carriers for pulmonary delivery since they can be nebulized without any structural or functional changes, and the aerosols produced are highly compatible with pulmonary drug delivery in human beings. The alveolar surface tension, in vitro cytotoxicity, biodistribution and pulmonary toxicity in rats of a single endotracheal spray of LNCs or paclitaxel-loaded LNCs were studied. In vitro cytotoxicity of LNCs after a spray remained unchanged. Biodistribution study showed a homogeneous repartition in the lungs in rats with an improvement in lung retention of the radiolabeled tracer loaded in LNCs compared to the absence of LNCs with a lung half-time of 8.8Â±0.7 hours. Bronchoalveolar fluid analysis revealed transient 7-day alveolar inflammation, reaching a maximum between days 2 and 4, characterized by a peak of granulocytes at day 1 followed by a peak of lymphocytes at day 3. Alveolar protein levels were increased at days 3 and 7. Acute inflammation was increased with paclitaxel-loaded LNCs in comparison with blank LNCs but dropped out at day 7. No histological pulmonary lesion was observed at day 60. LNCs lowered surface tension to a greater degree than Curosurf
