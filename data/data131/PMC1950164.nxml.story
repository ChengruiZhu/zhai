Huntington's disease (HD) is a tragic neurodegenerative disorder caused by a CAG repeat that specifies the size of a glutamine tract in the huntingtin protein, such that the longer the tract, the earlier the loss of striatal brain cells. A correlation of polyglutamine tract size has also implicated huntingtin in the proper functioning of mitochondria, the cell's energy factories. Here we have tested the prevailing hypothesis, that huntingtin may directly affect the mitochondrion, by using comprehensive gene expression analysis to judge whether the HD mutation may replicate the effects of 3-nitropropionic acid (3-NP), a compound known to inhibit mitochondria, with loss of striatal neurons. We found that, while mutant huntingtin and 3-NP both elicited energy starvation, the gene responses to the HD mutation, unlike the responses to 3-NP, did not highlight damage to mitochondria, but instead revealed effects on huntingtin-dependent processes. Thus, rather than direct inhibition, the polyglutamine tract size appears to modulate some normal activity of huntingtin that indirectly influences the management of the mitochondrion. Understanding the precise nature of this extra-mitochondrial process would critically guide efforts to achieve effective energy-based therapeutics in HD.
