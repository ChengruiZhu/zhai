Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic destructive disease that affects 1â€“3% of the general population, exacting substantial personal, social, and economic costs. Current treatments alleviate the symptoms and offer immediate relief for many patients but do not cure the disease. While the cause of the disease remains poorly understood, the completion of the Human Genome Project and the emergence of functional genomics and high-throughput technologies offer intriguing new possibilities. For example, expression profiling creates a molecular fingerprint of the disease status by quantifying the expression levels of thousand of genes simultaneously. Similarly, reverse genetics (the genetic modification of a particular gene in search of its function) allow for the creation of animal models of disease. To discover novel genes and/or cellular pathways involved in the development of the disease, the authors used two methods in an animal model of RA for large-scale expression profiling. They identified a large number of genes and molecular processes that are deregulated in the disease. Using this information, the authors described pathophysiologic determinants of RA and created a unique list of disease modifiers of potential therapeutic value.
