 1. Adrenalin when mixed with olive oil 1:100 and injected subcutaneously into a catfish will produce a marked pale spot and a general blanching of the whole fish. The general blanching will disappear in about a day. The pale spot may last 3 to 4 weeks. 2. Injections of adrenalin in oil 1:1000 to 1:10,000,000 cause the formation of only pale spots in catfishes. Adrenalin in oil 1:100,000,000 has no effect on the fish's color. 3. Acetylcholine, though ordinarily more powerful than adrenalin, when mixed with oil is effective only in high concentrations 1:20 to 1:100. It then produces clusters of moderately dark spots. 4. The pale spot on a catfish due to adrenalin in oil may be temporarily obliterated by intermedin. It will return of itself, and this process may be repeated a number of times. The same is true of the dark spots produced by acetylcholine in oil when subjected to adrenalin. These observations indicate the subcutaneous storage of both adrenalin and acetylcholine in oil. 5. In the natural color changes in catfishes the nervous neurohumors, probably also adrenalin and acetylcholine, appear both to be stored in the fish's lipoids and to serve thus as a means of lenghthening the times of initial color responses till these stores of neurohumors are exhausted.
