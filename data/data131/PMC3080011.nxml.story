We analyzed the variability in position, shape, size and incidence of the infraorbital foramen in Indian dry skulls as little literature is available on this foramen in Indians to prevent clinical complications during maxillofacial surgery and regional block anesthesia. Fifty-five Indian skulls from the Department of Anatomy CSM Medical University were examined. The 110 sides (left and right) of the skulls were analyzed by measuring the infraorbital foramina distances from infraorbital margin and the piriform aperture on both sides. The vertical and horizontal dimensions were also measured. All measurements were taken with a compass transferred to calipers and analyzed statistically. The mean distances between the infraorbital foramen and the infraorbital margin on the right and left side were 6.12 mm and 6.19 mm, respectively. The mean distances between the infraorbital foramen and the piriform aperture were 15.31 mm and 15.80 mm on the right and left sides, respectively. The mean vertical dimensions on the right and left side were 3.39 mm and 3.75 mm, respectively. The mean horizontal dimensions on the two sides were 3.19 mm and 3.52 mm. These results provide detailed knowledge of the anatomical characteristics and clinical importance of the infraorbital foramina which are of paramount importance for surgeons when performing maxillofacial surgery and regional block anesthesia.
