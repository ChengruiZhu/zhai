The binding of a receptor on one cell to a ligand on another is a process of broad biological interest, important to cell adhesion and signaling. Interactions between cell surfaces can be called “two-dimensional” because the reactive groups on interacting molecular pairs are constrained to move 100 nm or less in the direction perpendicular to the surfaces. The molecular reactive groups are attached to their respective cellular surfaces through a molecular tether embedded in the cell membrane. There are many parameters that might affect the observed binding kinetics, such as the distance between the cell surfaces, the length of the molecular tether, and the freedom of the reactive groups to move about on their molecular tether. A well-studied case of two-dimensional interactions is that through which circulating leukocytes capture to the endothelium and exit the blood into the tissues. Leukocyte capture presents an additional complexity: bonds that restrain leukocytes against the shearing force exerted by the blood must be capable of withstanding the force trying to pull the receptor and ligand apart at their noncovalent interface. New models have been proposed to explain the behavior of individual receptors and ligands, raising the question: which molecular behaviors have an effect on function?
