Two meta-workflows were evident from the analysis. In the first type, epidemiologists identify and characterize health-impacting events, determine their cause, and determine community-level responses to the event. Analysts of this type monitor information (primarily statistical case information) from syndromic or disease reporting system or other sources to determine whether there are any unusual diseases or clusters of disease outbreaks in the jurisdiction. This workflow involved three consecutive processes: triage, analysis and reporting. Investigation and response processes to disease outbreaks are both parallel and overlapping in many circumstances. In the second meta-workflow type, analysts monitor for a potential health event through text-based sources and data reports within their particular area of responsibility. This surveillance activity is often interspersed with other activities required of their job. They may generate a daily/weekly/monthly report or only report when an event is detected that requires notification/response. There are similar triage, analysis and reporting workflow stages to the first meta-workflow type, but in contrast these analysts are focused on informing leadership and response in the form of policy modification. They are also subject to answering leadership-driven biosurveillance queries.
