Gene expression profiling of human tissues typically reveals a complex structure of co-regulation of gene expression that has yet to be explored with regard to the genetic and environmental sources of covariance or its implications for quantitative and clinical traits. Here we show that peripheral blood samples from multiple studies can be described by nine common axes of variation that collectively explain up to one half of all transcriptional variance in blood. Specific axes diverge according to environmental variables such as lifestyle and infectious disease exposure, but a strong genetic component to axis regulation is also inferred. As few as 10 “blood-informative transcripts” (BITs) can be used to define each axis and potentially classify individuals with respect to multiple aspects of their blood and immune function. The analysis of longitudinal profiles of one individual shows how these change relative to clinical shifts in metabolic profile following viral infection. The notion that gene expression diverges along genetic paths of least resistance defined by these axes has important implications for interpreting differential expression in case-control studies of disease.
