Idelalisib is a highly selective oral inhibitor of PI3Kδ indicated for the treatment of patients with relapsed chronic lymphocytic leukemia in combination with rituximab. Despite additive clinical effects, previous studies have paradoxically demonstrated that targeted therapies potentially negatively affect anti-CD20 mAb effector mechanisms. To address these potential effects, we investigated the impact of PI3Kδ inhibition by idelalisib on the effector mechanisms of rituximab and obinutuzumab. At clinically relevant concentrations, idelalisib minimally influenced rituximab- and obinutuzumab-mediated Ab-dependent cellular cytotoxicity and phagocytosis on human lymphoma cell lines, while maintaining the superiority of obinutuzumab-mediated Ab-dependent cellular cytotoxicity. Consistent with this, idelalisib did not influence obinutuzumab-mediated B cell depletion in whole-blood B cell–depletion assays. Further, idelalisib significantly enhanced obinutuzumab-mediated direct cell death of chronic lymphocytic leukemia cells. In murine systems, in vivo inhibition of PI3Kδ minimally interfered with maximal rituximab- or obinutuzumab-mediated depletion of leukemic targets. In addition, the duration of rituximab- and obinutuzumab-mediated depletion of leukemia cells was extended by combination with PI3Kδ inhibition. Collectively, these data demonstrate that PI3Kδ inhibition does not significantly affect the effector mechanisms induced by rituximab or obinutuzumab and provides an effective in vivo therapeutic combination. Therefore, combinations of obinutuzumab and idelalisib are currently being assessed in clinical studies.
