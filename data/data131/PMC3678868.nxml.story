. However, the role of TLR9 in the pathophysiology of prostate cancer is unclear. The expression of TLR9 in radical prostatectomy samples (n=186) was studied using immunohistochemistry. TLR9 staining scores were compared with tumor stage, Gleason score and prostate-specific antigen (PSA) concentration prior to treatment and progression-free survival. Results revealed that 124 (66.7%) of the tumors were strongly positive, 59 (31.7%) were weakly positive and 3 (1.6%) were negative, for cytoplasmic TLR9 immunostaining in cancer cells. There was no significant association between cytoplasmic TLR9 expression and distributions of pT-class, prostatectomy sample margin status, Gleason score and preoperative PSA value. Prostate cancer-specific progression-free survival was significantly longer for patients whose tumors were graded as negative for cytoplasmic TLR9 expression, as compared with patients whose tumors were strongly immunopositive for cytoplasmic TLR9 (P=0.009). In the Cox regression analysis, high TLR9 expression was an independent marker of poor prognosis in prostate cancer. Expression of TLR9 is associated with poor progression-free survival in prostate cancer patients who were treated by radical prostatectomy with curative intent.
