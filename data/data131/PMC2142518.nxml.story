 1. It has been shown quantitatively that the degree of response of the hind limbs of tadpoles to the action of thyroxin is dependent upon the lengths of the limbs at the beginning of treatment. 2. Both the potency of the inducing substance and the rate of penetration of the substance into the animal might be involved in the effects of hydrogen ion concentration on induced development. 3. Changes in hydrogen ion concentration affect the inducing power of thyroxin and iodine differently. With thyroxin, it is the rate of penetration of the molecule which determines the amount of growth, but with iodine it is the chemical form in which the substance has entered the animal which is of prime importance. 4. The hydrogen ion concentration of thyroxin solutions does not affect their potency when they are injected into tadpoles. 5. Change in hydrogen ion concentration of the environment does not affect the potency of thyroxin injected into tadpoles. 6. When thyroxin is administered in the environmental solution its effects, as measured by increase in hind limb length are greater at higher than at lower hydrogen ion concentrations in the range tested. 7. Since the potency of thyroxin is unaffected by change in hydrogen ion concentration when the thyroxin solution is injected, the above fact (point 6) seems explicable only on the basis of differences in the rate of penetration of thyroxin into the animals at the different hydrogen ion concentrations. 8. These differences in penetration of the thyroxin at different hydrogen ion concentrations may be the result of a differential effect of hydrogen ion concentration upon the rate of metabolism of the animal. The metabolic rate is significantly greater when the tadpoles are kept in solutions of higher hydrogen ion concentration than when they are kept in solutions of low hydrogen ion concentration. It is postulated that the rate of metabolism, since it controls the rate of intake of the environmental fluid and therefore of dissolved thyroxin, also controls the amount of thyroxin-induced development. 9. Change in hydrogen ion concentration of iodine solutions affects their potency when injected into tadpoles. A peak of effectiveness is reached at about the neutral point, with a lowered efficiency as the hydrogen ion concentration is either increased or decreased from this point. 10. Change in hydrogen ion concentration of the environment affects the potency of iodine injected into tadpoles. The effect is similar to that noted in point 9. 11. The hydrogen ion concentration of the environment seems to affect the chemical nature of the iodine in solution in the environment. If this is so, it is possible that the differences in the metamorphic effects of iodine at different hydrogen ion concentrations are dependent upon the chemical form of iodine present. 12. The effect of hydrogen ion concentration on normal development is similar to that on thyroxin-induced development; an effect on the rate of metabolism of the animal causes increased growth in more acid solutions.
