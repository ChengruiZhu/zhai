 and it is assumed that they play an essential role in viral persistence in the human host. In order to identify cellular genes regulated by EBNA3A expression, cDNA encoding EBNA3A was incorporated into a recombinant adenoviral vector. Microarray analysis of human diploid fibroblasts infected with either adenovirus EBNA3A or an empty control adenovirus consistently showed an EBNA3A-specific induction of mRNA corresponding to the chaperones Hsp70 and Hsp70B/B′ and co-chaperones Bag3 and DNAJA1/Hsp40. Analysis of infected fibroblasts by real-time quantitative RT-PCR and Western blotting confirmed that EBNA3A, but not EBNA3C, induced expression of Hsp70, Hsp70B/B′, Bag3 and DNAJA1/Hsp40. This was also confirmed in a stable, inducible expression system. EBNA3A activated transcription from the Hsp70B promoter, but not multimerized heat-shock elements in transient transfection assays, consistent with specific chaperone and co-chaperone upregulation. Co-immunoprecipitation experiments suggest that EBNA3A can form a complex with the chaperone/co-chaperone proteins in both adenovirus-infected cells and EBV-immortalized lymphoblastoid cell lines. Consistent with this, induction of EBNA3A resulted in redistribution of Hsp70 from the cytoplasm to the nucleus. EBNA3A therefore specifically induces (and then interacts with) all of the factors necessary for an active Hsp70 chaperone complex.
