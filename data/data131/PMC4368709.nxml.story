Extensive tumor genome sequencing has provided raw material to understand mutational processes and identify cancer-associated somatic variants. However, fundamental problems remain to: i) separate ‘driver’ from ‘passenger’ mutations, ii) further understand the functional mechanisms and consequences of driver mutations, and iii) identify the cancer types in which each driver mutation is relevant. Here we analyze whole-genome and exome tumor sequencing data from the perspective of protein domains—the basic structural and functional units of proteins. Exploring the cancer-type-specific landscape of domain mutations across 21 cancer types, we identify both cancer-type-specific mutated domains and mutational hotspots. Frequently-mutated domains were identified for oncoproteins for which the ‘mutational hotspot’ phenomenon owing to the relative rarity of gain-of-function mutations is well known, and also for tumor suppressor proteins, for which more uniformly distributed loss-of-function driver mutations are expected. A given gene product may be perturbed differently in different cancers. Indeed, we observed systematic shifts between cancer types of the positions at which mutations occur within a given protein. Both known and novel candidate driver mutations were retrieved. Novel cancer gene candidates significantly overlapped with orthogonal systematic cancer screen hits, supporting the power of this approach to identify cancer genes.
