 "Skinned" muscle fibers, single fibers from the frog semitendinosus muscle in which the sarcolemma had been removed, could be reversibly activated by electrical stimulation. Electrical responsiveness was abolished when the skinned fiber was prepared from a muscle exposed to a cardiac glycoside, and the development of responsiveness was delayed when the muscle was bathed in high potassium solution. The findings were taken as evidence that active sodium-potassium exchange across the internal membranes restored electrical excitability, after the sarcolemma had been removed, by establishing a potential gradient across the internal membranes. In general, the contractions were graded with the strength of the applied current. On occasion, however, "all-or-none" type responses were seen, raising the possibility that the internal membranes were capable of an electrically regenerative response. Activation could also be produced by an elevation of the intracellular chloride ion concentration or a decrease in the intracellular potassium, ion concentration, suggesting that depolarization of some element of the internal membrane system, that is, a decrease in the potential of the lumen of the internal membrane system relative to the potential of the myofibrillar space, was responsible for activation in these experiments. The distribution of both the electrically induced contractions and those produced by changes in the intracellular ion concentrations indicated that the responsive element of the internal membrane system was electrically continuous over many sarcomeres.
