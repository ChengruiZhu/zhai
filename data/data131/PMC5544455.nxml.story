Over dimensioning in the gained measurements of the whole sample on CBCT images in relation to dimensions of producers is between 0.1006mm and 0.368mm. Even though over dimensioning is measured in millimetres, it has to be taken into consideration in clinical practice when planning an implant placement, and we can recommend safety zone of 0.5mm. There have been no statistically significant differences in the gained results in over dimensioning of implants of different alloys for horizontal and vertical measurements on CBCT images of Astra Tech, Brendet titanium implants and Straumann titanium-zirconium implants. Based on the goals of the study there have been confirmed statistically significant correlations of great value (from 0.841 to 0.936) of high level of importance between manufactured value of dimensions and average dimensions values gained through CBCT imaging in four types of implants (four test groups). The total exactness of measurements on CBCT scan in this research is 96.66% for horizontal measuring and 96.92% for vertical measuring. Therefore, we can conclude that CBCT as radiological method has an unavoidable importance in planning and successful realisation of dental implant procedure.
