The non-smoking group was older than the smoking group (61.4 years vs. 54.2, p=0.0004). Twenty-two percent of the surgical group and 12% of the non-surgical group were smokers. There was no significant difference between smokers and non-smokers in regards to the proportion of patients who were obese, had diabetes, had experienced rotator cuff tear symptoms for more than a year, had utilized physical therapy, had a large RCT, or who had received workersâ€™ compensation. Smoking status was not significantly associated with allocation to surgical versus non-surgical treatment (OR=0.85, p= 0.762). After adjustment for covariates, subjects who smoked reported less favorable baseline adjusted WORC scores (40.9 vs. 54.5, p=0.0008), lower ASES scores (43.0 vs. 59.9, p=0.0001), as well as worse pain scores (59.5 vs. 42.9, p=0.0001). Within the non-surgical management group, smokers reported significantly lower adjusted WORC scores (38.0 vs. 56.8, p=0.0127), lower ASES scores (39.2 vs. 61.6, p=0.0872), and worse pain (61.9 vs. 42.1, p=0.0176) over 48 months. Similarly, in patients who underwent rotator cuff repair, smokers reported significantly lower adjusted WORC scores (31.1 vs. 40.4, p=0.0352), lower ASES scores (37.7 vs. 50.0, p=0.0143), and worse pain scores (63.2 vs. 51.5, p=0.0408) over the 48-week follow-up period.
