All 14 of the SEC institutions chose to participate and provided data. 79 reconstructions were reported with RTP data available for 78 women soccer athletes. Overall RTP rate was 84.6%. There was statistical significance in RTP rates favoring athletes in earlier years of eligibility versus later years (p<0.05). Athletes in eligibility years 4 and 5 combined had a RTP rate of 40%. Scholarship status likewise showed statistical significance (p<0.001) favoring RTP rate for scholarship athletes (91%) vs. non-scholarship athletes (45.5%). Athlete position (p=0.242) and depth chart status (p=0.110) showed no significant effect on RTP. In examining surgery specific variables; RTP rate for autograft (87.9%), allograft (75%), and combined graft (50%) demonstrated no difference (p=0.218). RTP rates were similar for the two most commonly used grafts: patellar tendon autograft and hamstring autograft (p=0.186). Femoral tunnel drilling technique showed no effect (p=0.725) on RTP rate for transtibial, accessory medial portal, or two incision techniques. When comparing multiple graft fixation constructs on both the femoral and tibial side, no difference was observed as it relates to RTP. RTP in isolated ACL reconstruction (77.3%) versus ACL reconstruction with concomitant procedures (88.9%) showed no difference. For players undergoing revision ACL reconstruction versus primary, RTP rate was 77.3% and 87.3% respectively, without significant difference (p=0.499).
