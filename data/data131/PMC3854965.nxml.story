We present an analysis of the genome sequences of multiple wild house mice. Wild house mice are about ten times more genetically diverse than humans, reflecting the large effective population size of the species. This manifests itself as more effective natural selection acting against deleterious mutations and favouring advantageous mutations in mice than in humans. We show that there are strong signals of adaptive evolution at many sites in the genome. We estimate that 80% of adaptive changes in the genome are in gene regulatory elements and only 20% are in protein-coding genes. We find that nucleotide diversity is markedly reduced close to gene regulatory elements and protein-coding gene sequences. The reductions around regulatory elements can be explained by selection purging deleterious mutations that occur in the elements themselves, but this process only partially explains the diversity reductions around protein-coding genes. Recurrent adaptive evolution, which can also cause local reductions in diversity via selective sweeps, may be necessary to fully explain the patterns in diversity that we observe surrounding genes. Although most adaptive molecular evolution appears to be regulatory, adaptive phenotypic change may principally be driven by structural change in proteins.
