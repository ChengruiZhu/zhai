 The basic protein protamine causes a rapid hemolysis when incubated with the red blood cells of many mammalian species. The age of the cells does not affect the process. Neutralization of the active side groups of the protamine molecule with formalinization demonstrates that a specific degree of charge is necessary for hemolysis, as more than 30 per cent of the guanidine groups must remain unreacted to maintain activity. Unlike the hemolysis induced by the synthetic polypeptides polylysine and polyhomoarginine, protamine hemolysis is temperature-dependent. Whole lipoprotein material derived from red blood cell membranes inhibits protamine hemolysis to a greater extent than do the membranes themselves, serum, serum protein fractions, or cholesterol. The phosphatide and protein moieties derived from the membranes are quite avid in inhibiting protamine hemolysis. A probable explanation is that intracellular aggregation of these structural elements may cause changes in electrostatic charge and surface tension which result in increased permeability. The hemolytic and antitumor cell properties of protamine could not be segregated from its animal toxicity. Despite formalinization to a degree which eliminated the former, the compound remained quite toxic to mice and rabbits.
