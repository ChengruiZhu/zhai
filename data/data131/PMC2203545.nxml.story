. From the "artificial node" of the fiber, action potentials were recorded under current-clamping condition together with twitches of the node. The action potentials were stored on magnetic tape. The node was then made inexcitable by tetrodotoxin or by a sodium-free solution, and the wave form of the action potential stored on magnetic tape was imposed on the node under voltage-clamp condition (simulated AP). The twitch height caused by the simulated AP's was always smaller than the twitch height produced by the real action potentials, the ratio being about 0.3 at room temperature. The results strongly suggest that the transverse tubular system is excitable and is necessary for the full activation of twitch, and that the action potential of the tubules contributes to about 70 % of the total mechanical output of the normal isotonic twitch at 20°C. Similar results were obtained in the case of tetanic contraction. At a temperature near 10°C, twitches produced by the simulated AP were not very different (85 % of control amplitude) from the twitches caused by real action potentials. This indicates that the excitability of the tubules becomes less necessary for the full activation of twitch as the temperature becomes lower.
