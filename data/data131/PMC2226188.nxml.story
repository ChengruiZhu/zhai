Stereological techniques of point and intersection counting were used to measure morphological parameters from light and electron micrographs of frog skeletal muscle. Results for sartorius muscle are as follows: myofibrils comprise 83% of fiber volume; their surface to volume ratio is 3.8 mum-1. Mitochondria comprise 1.6% of fiber volume. Transverse tubules comprise 0.32% of fiber volume, and their surface area per volume of fiber is 0.22 mum-1. Terminal cisternae of the sarcoplasmic reticulum comprise 4.1% of fiber volume; their surface area per volume of fiber is 0.54 mum-1. Longitudinal sarcoplasmic reticullum comprises 5.0% of fiber volume, and its surface area per volume of fiber is 1.48 mum-1. Longitudinal bridges between terminal cisternae on either side of a Z disk were observed infrequently; they make up only 0.035% of fiber volume and their surface area per volume of fiber is 0.009 mum-1. T-SR junction occurs over 67% of the surface of transverse tubules and over 27% of the surface of terminal cisternae. The surface to volume ratio of the caveolae is 48 mum-1; caveolae may increase the sarcolemmal surface area by 47%. Essentially the same results were obtained from semitendinosus fibers.
