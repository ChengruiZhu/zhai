MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are noncoding RNAs with important roles in regulating gene expression. In studying the earliest nuclear steps of miRNA biogenesis, we observe that primary miRNA (pri-miRNA) transcripts retained at transcription sites due to the deletion of 3′-end processing signals are converted more efficiently into precursor miRNAs (pre-miRNAs) than pri-miRNAs that are cleaved, polyadenylated, and released. Flanking exons, which also increase retention at transcription sites, likewise contribute to increased levels of intronic pri-miRNAs. Consistently, efficiently processed endogenous pri-miRNAs are enriched in chromatin-associated nuclear fractions. In contrast, pri-miRNAs that accumulate to high nuclear levels after cleavage and polyadenylation because of the presence of a viral RNA element (the ENE of the Kaposi's sarcoma–associated herpes virus polyadenylated nuclear RNA) are not efficiently processed to precursor or mature miRNAs. Exogenous pri-miRNAs unexpectedly localize to nuclear foci containing splicing factor SC35; yet these foci are unlikely to represent sites of miRNA transcription or processing. Together, our results suggest that pri-miRNA processing is enhanced by coupling to transcription.
