Mandibular fracture is usually the clinical end of bisphosphonate-related osteonecrosis of the jaw. This is a painful complication and patients cannot feed as usual, with a worsening of their quality of life. The goal of treatment in bisphosphonate related osteonecrosis of jaw (BRONJ) patients is to slow progression of bone necrosis. We present a novel technique for treatment of severe mandibular BRONJ in stage 3 patients that present with a high risk to develop fracture, since they have a residual unaffected mandibular bone height less than 6 mm. We treated 10 patients in this clinical situation with an extra-oral application of a reconstructive plate superficial to the platysma, to keep the plate separated from the infected site to avoid contamination and consequent need of removal, followed by an intraoral approach for active curettage of mandibular necrosis. The preservation of blood supply to the mandible and avoidance of direct contact of the infected site with the reconstructive plate are some advantages of this technique. This plate allows enhancement of mandibular strength, allowing proper treatment of the BRONJ site on the oral side without fear of causing a mandibular fracture when the residual mandible is thin. This technical solution guarantees these patients an extended disease-free period since it is effective in preventing mandibular fractures in patients with low mandibular residual height left after the BRONJ onset.
