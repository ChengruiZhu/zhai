Keloids are mysterious soft‐tissue tumors that are characterized by excessive reparative processes composed of collagen‐forming fibroblasts and inflammatory cells. Generally, complete tumor excision regardless of sufficient margin is considered as a first‐line treatment because they are considered reactive rather than a neoplastic condition. Recently, a specific part of the keloids is being highlighted as an important microstructure for local recurrence, but there has been very little evidence. We conducted a prospective study to evaluate the relationship of recurrence and several clinicopathological parameters with specific focus on surgical resection margin. A total 87 cases of auricular keloids from 71 patients were included. The resection margins were carefully evaluated by an exhaustive grossing method and thorough microstructural assessment. During up to 48.8 months of the follow‐up period, local recurrence has been monitored and documented. The clinicopathological data including symptoms, bilaterality, size, location, prior treatment and operation history, gross type and etiology were collected and analyzed. Positive margin status was significantly related to tumor recurrence (
