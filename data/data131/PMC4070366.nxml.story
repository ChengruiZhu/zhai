The present paper gives a new computational framework within which radiative transfer in a varying refractive index biological tissue can be studied. In our previous works, Legendre transform was used as an innovative view to handle the angular derivative terms in the case of uniform refractive index spherical medium. In biomedical optics, our analysis can be considered as a forward problem solution in a diffuse optical tomography imaging scheme. We consider a rectangular biological tissue-like domain with spatially varying refractive index submitted to a near infrared continuous light source. Interaction of radiation with the biological material into the medium is handled by a radiative transfer model. In the studied situation, the model displays two angular redistribution terms that are treated with Legendre integral transform. The model is used to study a possible detection of abnormalities in a general biological tissue. The effect of the embedded nonhomogeneous objects on the transmitted signal is studied. Particularly, detection of targets of localized heterogeneous inclusions within the tissue is discussed. Results show that models accounting for variation of refractive index can yield useful predictions about the target and the location of abnormal inclusions within the tissue.
