The pelvis and the spine form a system balancing human skeleton. Within this system, the pelvis adapts to age-related changes in the spine. Previous studies were predominantly focused on changes of pelvic parameters in the sagittal plane. The aim of this study was to reveal age-related changes of lesser pelvic dimensions at different levels of the pelvic cavity in the sagittal and coronal planes and to explore sexual dimorphism in age-related tendencies. The computed tomography pelvimetry was performed on the three-dimensional workstation. The research sample included 211 females aged 18 to 84 years and 181 males aged 18 to 82 years, who underwent an examination at the Riga East University Hospital, Clinical Center “Gailezers,” Latvia. Three pelvic angles and transverse and sagittal diameters of the lesser pelvis were measured at four levels: the inlet, two axial planes in the mid-cavity, and the outlet. The results demonstrated that more pronounced age-related changes occurred in the inlet and the outlet of the lesser pelvis. The mid-cavity was less changing. The transverse diameter between acetabular centers and the sagittal diameter at the level of ischial spines were independent of age. In general, the common age-related trends were observed for pelvic parameters in females and males. A single exception was the proportion of diameters at the level of ischial spines, which decreased in males only. For parameters associated with pelvic floor diseases, age-related changes occurred in the direction of pathology.
