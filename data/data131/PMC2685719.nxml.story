Protein–protein interactions mediate numerous biological processes. In the last decade, there have been efforts to comprehensively map protein–protein interactions occurring in an organism. The interaction data generated from these high-throughput projects can be represented as interconnected networks. It has been found that knockouts of proteins residing in topologically central positions in the networks more likely result in lethality of the organism than knockouts of peripheral proteins. However, it is difficult to accurately define topologically central proteins because high-throughput data is error-prone and some interactions are not as reliable as others. In addition, the architecture of interaction networks varies in different tissues for multi-cellular organisms. To this end, we present a novel computational approach to identify central proteins while considering the confidence of data and gene expression in tissues. Moreover, our approach takes into account multiple alternative paths in interaction networks. We apply our method to yeast and nematode interaction networks. We find that the likelihood of observing lethality and pleiotropy when a given protein is eliminated correlates better with our centrality score for that protein than with its scores based on traditional centrality metrics. Finally, we set up a framework to identify central proteins in tissue-specific interaction networks.
