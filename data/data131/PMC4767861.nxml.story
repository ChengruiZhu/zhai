 The maximally tolerated dose (MTD) of cytotoxic agents has historical precedence in treating cancer, as it was believed that dose and therapeutic effect are intrinsically linked and that the MTD would provide greatest therapeutic value. With molecularly targeted agents, the premise of preventing toxicity to normal tissues while modulating tumor growth provides a potential for an increased therapeutic window. Results from these targeted agents suggest we are entering an era of chronic cancer management, which will require design of regimens with long-term tolerability. A corresponding switch from MTD-based (toxicity-driven) dosing strategies to alternative paradigms is also expected. The challenge with these targeted agents is to fully understand the complex relationship between pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and safety and efficacy in early-stage trials, so that the optimal dose and schedule for registration trials may be identified. This review provides a systematic survey of the applications submitted to the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for oncology indications, from 2010 through early 2015, and summarizes the dose selection rationale for registrational trials, the relationship of the MTD to outcomes of the final label dose, the postmarketing requirements or commitments related to dose optimization activities, the role of biomarkers, and typical exposureâ€“response modeling methods.
