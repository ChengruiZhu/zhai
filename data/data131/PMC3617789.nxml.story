In order to improve the mechanical and biological properties of calcium phosphate cement (CPC, nanometer-biomaterial) for bone reconstruction in the rabbit femoral defect model, fibrin glue (FG, the natural product, purified from the blood) was introduced at three different ratios. The CPC powder and the FG solution were mixed, respectively, at the powder/liquid (P/L) ratios (g/mL) of 1:1, 3:1, and 5:1 (g/mL), and pure CPC was used as a control. After being implanted into the femoral defect in rabbit, the healing process was evaluated by micro-computed tomography scan, biomechanical testing, and histological examination. By micro-computed tomography analysis, the P/L ratio of 1:1 (g/mL) group indicated the largest quantity of new bone formation at 4 weeks, 8 weeks, and 12 weeks after implantation, respectively. Bone volume per trabecular volume of the 1:1 group was highest in the four groups, which was 1.45% ± 0.42%, 7.35% ± 1.45%, and 29.10% ± 1.67% at 4 weeks, 8 weeks, and 12 weeks after the operation, respectively. In the biomechanical tests, the compressive strength and the elastic modulus of the three CPC–FG groups were much higher than those of the pure CPC group at the determined time point (
