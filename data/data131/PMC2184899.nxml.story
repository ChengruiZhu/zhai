Hapten-specific delayed-type hypersensitivity (DTH) was induced in several strains of mice. (4-hydroxy-3-nitrophenyl)acetyl-bovine gamma globulin (NP-BGG)-primed mice which did not bear the Ig1b heavy-chain linkage group made a NP-specific DTH response when challenged with NP bovine serum albumin (BSA) and failed to respond to challenge with (4- hydroxy-5-iodo-3-nitrophenyl)acetyl-bovine serum albumin (NIP-BSA). Strains of NP-BGG-primed mice bearing the Ig1b allotype, including SJL, responded to challenges of either NP-BSA or NIP-BSA. F1 hybrids between a cross-reactive strain, C57BL/6, and two other noncross-reactive strains were cross-reactive. Genetic mapping of the NIP-cross-reactive DTH response localized the trait to the VH-region of the Ig1b heavy- chain linkage group. The fine-specificity pattern of the T-cell anti-NP response, and the genetic mapping of this trait, were analogous to the reported fine specificity and mapping data of the humoral heteroclitic anti-NP response. Adoptive transfer studies on the ability to transfer NP-specific DTH between various strain combinations showed that the T- cell donors and the recipient must have homology for at least the I-A subregion. Whenever NP-specific reactivity was transferred from a strain which cross-reactively responded to NIP, the recipient also responded to both NP and NIP. The implications of the control of NP- primed DTH-reactive populations of T cells by two distinct genetic regions, VH and H-2, were discussed.
