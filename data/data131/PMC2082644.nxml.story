HPT is usually treated by surgical removal of the enlarged parathyroid glands, which is done with great efficiency. However, ideally, doctors would like to know what drives the overgrowth of the parathyroid glands to be able to develop drugs for treatment or disease prophylaxis. Researchers recently reported that the cells in enlarged parathyroid glands from patients with HPT contain high amounts of β-catenin. This protein is part of the Wnt signaling pathway, which has been found to be disrupted in many tumor entities in other organs. In the absence of Wnt proteins, a group of proteins called the β-catenin destruction complex marks β-catenin so that it is rapidly destroyed. When Wnt proteins bind to a cell-surface receptor called Frizzled and a coreceptor called LRP5, the destruction complex is inhibited and β-catenin accumulates. This accumulation induces the production of other proteins (in particular, c-Myc) that stimulate cell growth and division. The accumulation of β-catenin in the enlarged parathyroid glands of patients with HPT could, therefore, significantly contribute to the overgrowth of their glands—but what causes β-catenin accumulation? In this study, the researchers have investigated this question to try to identify a target for drugs to treat HPT.
