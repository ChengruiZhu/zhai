 gene encodes a small integral membrane phosphoprotein with two established functions: degradation of the viral coreceptor CD4 in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and augmentation of virus particle release from the plasma membrane of HIV-1–infected cells. We show here that Vpu is also largely responsible for the previously observed decrease in the expression of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I molecules on the surface of HIV-1–infected cells. Cells infected with HIV-1 isolates that fail to express Vpu, or that express genetically modified forms of Vpu that no longer induce CD4 degradation, exhibit little downregulation of MHC class I molecules. The effect of Vpu on class I biogenesis was analyzed in more detail using a Vpu-expressing recombinant vaccinia virus (VV). VV-expressed Vpu induces the rapid loss of newly synthesized endogenous or VV-expressed class I heavy chains in the ER, detectable either biochemically or by reduced cell surface expression. This effect is of similar rapidity and magnitude as the VV-expressed Vpu-induced degradation of CD4. Vpu had no discernible effects on cell surface expression of VV-expressed mouse CD54, demonstrating the selectivity of its effects on CD4 and class I heavy chains. VVexpressed Vpu does not detectably affect class I molecules that have been exported from the ER. The detrimental effects of Vpu on class I molecules could be distinguished from those caused by VV-expressed herpes virus protein ICP47, which acts by decreasing the supply of cytosolic peptides to class I molecules, indicating that Vpu functions in a distinct manner from ICP47. Based on these findings, we propose that Vpu-induced downregulation of class I molecules may be an important factor in the evolutionary selection of the HIV-1–specific
