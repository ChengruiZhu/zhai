Evidence has shown that neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT) is correlated with patientsâ€™ overall postoperative complications. But investigations on relationship between NACT and postoperative infectious complications, which is closely linked to intestinal barrier damage, were scanty. Accordingly, 90 patients with advanced gastric cancer were included in this study. The differences in postoperative infectious complications were determined between NACT group in which patients received NACT before surgery and SURG group in which received surgical treatment immediately after diagnosis. The damage of mechanical structure of intestinal barrier was assessed by hematoxylin and eosin staining, transmission electron microscopy, and immunohistochemistry. Mucosal microbiota changes were determined by using a 16S rRNA gene sequencing approach. Results showed that the incidence of postoperative infectious complications were significantly higher in the NACT group. Tight junctions were disrupted, and claudin-1, ZO-1 and occludin were down-regulated in patients with infectious complications in overall compared with those without. And similarly, the patients in the NACT group also showed damaged intestinal barrier compared with those in SURG group. Besides, the total diversity of mucosal related bacteria was decreased and relative abundance of some probiotics, such as
