Brushing is the most common cleansing method employed on complete dentures and it may damage the integrity of acrylic resin, the main component of this type of prosthesis. This study evaluated the abrasion resistance of artificial teeth with different number of acrylic layers, and the abrasiveness of specific and non-specific dentifrices for denture cleaning. The abrasion test was conducted by a tooth brushing device, using soft toothbrushes under load (200g). Sixty artificial teeth specimens were manufactured, 12 from each brand: Vipi-Dent Plus (Dental Vipi), Trubyte Biotone (Dentsply), Trilux (Ruthinium), Ivostar (Ivoclar) and SR Vivodent PE (Ivoclar). Three brands of dentifrices were selected: Colgate (Colgate-Palmolive), Bonyplus (Bonyf AG) and Dentu-Creme (Dentco). Distilled water was used as control. The brushing time was 100 minutes, at 356 strokes/minute. The specimens were weighed on an analytical balance before and after the abrasion test. Analysis of dentifrices' abrasive particles was made by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Two-way ANOVA and Tukey tests were employed (a=0.05). The general mean of weight loss values were obtained: 6.1 mg (Ivostar); 6.0 mg (Trilux); 5.9 mg (Trubyte); 5.8 mg (Vipi); 5.3 mg (Vivodent). The abrasiveness difference among teeth brands was not statistically significant. The Colgate dentifrice produced the greatest weight reduction (10.1 mg), followed by Dentu-Creme (7.6 mg). Bonyplus was the least abrasive (2.4 mg), similar to the distilled water used as control group (3.1 mg) (p=0.05). It was concluded that all acrylic teeth presented similar abrasion resistance. Specific dentifrices for dentures tend to cause less damage to acrylic resin.
