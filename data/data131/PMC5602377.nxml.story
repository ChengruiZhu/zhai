Overall, women above 18 years who had been referred to an HPV center were more likely to have used psychiatric medication (odds ratio [OR]: 1.88 [95% CI 1.48–2.40]) or to have been hospitalized because of a psychiatric disorder within 5 years prior to the first vaccine registration (OR: 2.13 [95% CI 1.59–2.86]). Specifically, referred women were more likely to have used antipsychotics, antidepressants, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) medication or anxiolytics, and to have been hospitalized for affective disorders or anxiety, but not to have been hospitalized for schizoid, ADHD or eating disorders. In addition, they were more likely to have had talk therapy or psychometric test performed prior to vaccination (OR: 1.72 [95% CI 0.1.35–2.18] and OR: 1.67 [95% CI 1.30–2.13], respectively). Referred women of all ages had higher use of GP before vaccination. Population attributable fraction analyses indicated that psychiatric medication, hospitalization due to a psychiatric disorder and use of talk therapy, or psychometric test “explained” 13%, 10%, 12% and 11% of the referrals, respectively. Results did not change substantially when adjusted for potential confounders.
