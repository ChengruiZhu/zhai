Actin self-assembles into filaments, and this produces forces that deform cell membranes in a large number of motile processes. While physical measurements have been performed of the force produced by growth of either a single filament or a large intricate array of filaments organized in an active macroscopic gel, these measurements don't provide a clear picture of how force is produced by the assembly of each filament within a complex structure. The present study explores a situation between these two extremes by measuring the force produced by the assembly of a small number of filaments. We developed a method in which actin filaments grow from the surface of magnetic beads that are aligned by a controlled magnetic field. The distance between beads in a chain-like arrangement increases with time when the force is kept constant. We observe that the growth of actin filaments is not affected by the load, in contrast to the widely accepted “Brownian ratchet model.” Instead, our results suggest that the surface opposite growing filaments imposes restrictions on the rotational fluctuations of a filament at its free hinge anchoring point, inducing a repulsive force. The confinement of filaments increases as they grow, and this in turn increases the repulsive force developed by their growth. This entropy-based mechanism may operate during motile processes when actin networks are loosely organized.
