Gamma-frequency (25â€“100 Hz) oscillations in the brain often arise as a result of an interaction between excitatory and inhibitory cell populations. For this mechanism to work, the interaction must be sufficiently strong, and connectivity and external drives to participating neurons must be sufficiently homogeneous. As the interactions become weaker, either because the neuronal ensembles become smaller or because synapses weaken, the rhythms deteriorate, and eventually break down. This fact, by itself, is not surprising, but details of how the breakdown occurs are subtle. In particular, our analysis leads to the conclusion that in realistically heterogeneous networks, gamma rhythms must arise quickly, within a small number of oscillation periods, if they arise at all. Our findings suggest explanations for recent experimental findings concerning the minimal spatial extent of stimuli eliciting gamma oscillations in the primary visual cortex, the modulation of gamma oscillations in the primary visual cortex by attention, as well as our own experimental results, reported here, concerning the minimal light intensity below which optogenetic drive to pyramidal cells in a kainate-activated hippocampal slice results in disruption of an ongoing gamma oscillation. Our analysis leads to experimentally testable predictions about the behavior of the excitatory and inhibitory cells in these experiments.
