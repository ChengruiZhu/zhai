The term exaptation describes the process by which a trait that is initially just a by-product of another function may become important in a later evolutionary phase. For example, feathers served to insulate dinosaurs before helping birds fly. On the level of enzymes, bi-functionality can contribute to microbial evolution through exaptation. However, bi-functional enzymes may cause metabolic conflicts, if they are involved in different metabolic pathways. By characterizing properties of modern and computationally reconstructed ancestral variants of the sugar isomerase HisA, we demonstrate that it has been a bi-functional enzyme for the last two billion years. Most likely, bi-functionality persisted because the remaining TrpF activity is not harmful or its elimination would concurrently compromise HisA activity. Moreover, this substrate ambiguity is advantageous, as it allows compensating a gene loss as exemplified by the Actinobacteria. These microbes have lost the isomerase TrpF but possess the bi-functional HisA homolog PriA, which takes over the roles of both HisA and TrpF. Our results argue to view bi-functionality not as an evolutionary disadvantage but rather as a contribution to the evolvability of novel functions via exaptation.
