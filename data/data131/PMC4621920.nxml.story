This trial was designed to compare the efficacy and safety between epirubicin (E) and carboplatin (C) in combination with paclitaxel (P) and trastuzumab (H) in neoadjuvant setting. In 13 Chinese cancer centers, 100 patients with HER2-positive, locally advanced breast cancer were 1:1 randomized to receive medication as follows: trastuzumab and paclitaxel weekly combined with carboplatin weekly for PCH group, or epirubicin every 3 weeks for PEH group. Patients were given 4 to 6 cycles of chemotherapy. The primary endpoint was pathologic complete response (pCR) rate, which was no significant difference in PCH and PEH regimen (39.1% vs. 48.8%; p=0.365). However, PEH regimen achieved higher pCR in luminal-B (HER2-poitive) subgroup (55.0% vs. 24.0%; p = 0.033), but not in ERBB2+ subgroup (42.9% vs. 57.1%; p = 0.355). PEH regimen showed a favorable efficacy in PIK3CA mutated subgroup (69.2% vs.23.5%, p=0.012). No significant difference was observed in the subgroup analysis of TP53 mutation status, PTEN expression, FCGR2A SNP and FCGR3A SNP. Both regimens as neoadjuvant chemotherapy achieve similar efficacy and safety. PEH might improve pCR rate, especially in the luminal-B subtype and PIK3CA mutation subtype. PEH is feasible and less likely to increase the incidence of acute cardiac events compared to PCH.
