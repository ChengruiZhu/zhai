Eukaryotic cells contain multiple membrane-bound compartments, each with a distinct function and molecular composition. Proteins are transported from one compartment to another by vesicular carriers. Formation of these carriers requires coat proteins, which both shape the membrane into a vesicle and select the proteins that are to be included as cargo. In many cases, cargo selection is facilitated by an adaptor protein (AP) complex, of which 5 have been identified. The most recently identified complex, AP-5, localises to a late endosomal/lysosomal compartment, and patients with mutations in AP-5 have a form of hereditary spastic paraplegia characterised by aberrant lysosomes. However, the precise function of AP-5, including its cargo and its pathway, has until now been unclear. In the present study, we have used unbiased subcellular proteomics to look for changes in the localisation of thousands of different proteins in cells from which AP-5 has been deleted by gene editing. We found that there are defects in the retrieval of several proteins from late endosomes back to the Golgi apparatus. Thus, we propose that AP-5 facilitates a novel late-acting retrieval pathway, which contributes to normal lysosomal homeostasis.
