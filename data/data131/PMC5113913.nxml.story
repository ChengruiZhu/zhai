Apoptosis is the major downregulated pathway in cancer. Simultaneous inhibition using specific small interfering RNA (siRNA) of two key player genes, p53 and TNF, is an interesting and feasible strategy when it comes to investigating various molecular pathways and biological processes in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), which is one of the most aggressive and therapeutically unresponsive forms of breast cancers. Our present research focuses on evaluating the impact of double p53-siRNA and TNF-siRNA knockdown at a cellular level, and also evaluating cell proliferation, apoptosis, induction of autophagy, and gene expression by using reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction array approaches. Simultaneous inhibition of p53 and TNF in Hs578T TNBC human cell line revealed a panel of up- and downregulated genes involved in apoptosis. Furthermore, the effects of double gene knockdown were validated in a second TNBC cell line, MDA-MB-231, by using reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction TaqMan assay. All our findings help in understanding the functional mechanisms of extrinsic apoptosis, cell signaling pathways, and the mechanisms involved in tumor cell survival, growth, and death in TNBC.
