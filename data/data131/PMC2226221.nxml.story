Ca2+, Mg2+-ionophores X537A and A23,187 (10(-7)-10(-6) M) induced the release of adenine nucleotides adenosine diphosphate (ADP, adenosine triphosphate (ATP), serotonin, beta-glucuronidase, Ca2+, and Mg2+ from washed human platelets. Enzymes present in the cytoplasm or mitochondria, and Zn2+ were not released. The rate of ATP and Ca2+ release measured by firefly lantern extract and murexide dye, respectively, was equivalent to that produced by the physiological stimulant thrombin. Ionophore-induced release of ADP, and serotonin was substantially (approximately 60%) but not completely inhibited by EGTA, EDTA, and high extracellular Mg2+, without significant reduction of Ca2+ release. The ionophore-induced release reaction is therefore partly dependent upon uptake of extracellular Ca2+ (demonstrated using 45Ca), but also occurs to a significant extent due to release into the cytoplasm of intracellular Ca2+. The ionophore-induced release reaction and aggregation of platelets could be blocked by prostaglandin E1 (PGE1) or dibutyryl cyclic AMP. The effects of PGE1, and N6, O2- dibutyryl adenosine 3':5'-cyclic monophosphoric acid (dibutyryl cAMP) were synergistically potentiated by the phosphodiesterase inhibitor theophylline. It is proposed that Ca2+ is the physiological trigger for platelet secretion and aggregation and that its intracellular effects are strongly modulated by adenosine 3':5'-cyclic monophosphoric acid (cyclic AMP).
