Tyrosyl kinase activity in vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) acquired from host cells that differ in morphology was investigated. VSV grown in baby hamster kidney (BHK) cells with rounded morphology and a high efficiency of colony formation in soft agar (Rous sarcoma virus [RSV]- transformed and suspension BHK cells) was compared with VSV grown in BHK cells with a flattened morphology and lower efficiency of colony formation in soft agar (RSV-infected revertant and control BHK cells). Tyrosyl kinase activity measured with the substrates angiotensin II peptide or casein was found at 7-10-fold higher levels in virus released from the anchorage-independent BHK cells. Most of the VSV- associated tyrosyl kinases acquired from the RSV-transformed BHK cells reacted with antiserum to pp60src, whereas the activity acquired from the suspension BHK cells was unaffected by anti-src serum. The overall levels of tyrosyl kinase in subcellular fractions of the host BHK cells were also measured. Like the VSV released from them, the RSV- transformed cell extracts contained high levels. The suspension cells, however, contained the same low levels of tyrosyl kinase as was found in the control BHK cell extracts. Therefore, tyrosyl kinase was concentrated and acquired by VSV from the anchorage-independent suspension BHK cells. VSV-associated protein kinases acquired from other cell types followed a similar pattern. Tyrosyl kinase levels were high in VSV released from suspension cultures (Chinese hamster ovary and HeLa) and from virally transformed cells (Kirsten murine sarcoma virus-transformed rat kidney cells) and low in VSV released from an anchorage-dependent primary cell culture (chick embryo fibroblasts).
