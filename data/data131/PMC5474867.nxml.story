Through the analysis of the thermodilution curve recorded at the tip of an arterial catheter after the injection of a cold bolus in the venous circulation, transpulmonary thermodilution intermittently measures cardiac output. This measure allows the calibration of pulse contour analysis. This provides continuous and real time monitoring of cardiac output, which is not possible with the pulmonary artery catheter. Transpulmonary thermodilution provides several variables beyond cardiac output. It estimates the end-diastolic volume of the four cardiac cavities, which is a marker of cardiac preload. It provides an estimation of the systolic function of the combined ventricles. It is more direct than the pulmonary artery catheter, but does not allow the distinct estimation of right and left cardiac function. It is easier and faster to perform than echocardiography, but does not provide a full evaluation of the cardiac structure and function. Transpulmonary thermodilution has the unique advantage of being able to estimate at the bedside extravascular lung water, which quantifies the volume of pulmonary oedema, and pulmonary vascular permeability, which quantifies the degree of a pulmonary capillary leak. Both indices are helpful for guiding fluid strategy, especially in case of acute respiratory distress syndrome.
