The proto-oncogene Ras mediates signaling pathways controlling cell proliferation and development by cycling between active and inactive conformational states. Mutations that affect the ability to switch between states are associated with over 25% of human tumors. However, despite much effort, details of how these mutations affect the fidelity of activating conformational transitions remain unclear. Here we employ extensive molecular dynamics simulations combined with principal component analysis to investigate whether the subtle differences among functionally distinct isoforms and oncogenic mutants are associated with detectable dynamical differences. Our results reveal that wild-type K-Ras, the most prevalent isoform in a number of cancers, and mutant H-Ras A59G are intrinsically more dynamic than wild-type H-Ras. Furthermore, we have observed the first spontaneous GTP-to-GDP transition of H-Ras A59G during unbiased molecular dynamics simulation. These results indicate that key changes in sequence can lead to different dynamic properties that may be relevant for the unique physiological and aberrant functions of Ras isoforms and mutants. Furthermore, the current results shed further light on the conformational transition mechanism of this important molecular switch.
