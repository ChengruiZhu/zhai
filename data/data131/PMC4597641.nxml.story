The result were analyzed statistically, means and SDs were calculated. Only right-legged subjects were included in the analysis. The Shapiro-Wilk test was used to test normality of the distribution. Some of the data did not have a normal distribution so in order to compare results of different groups a non-parametric Mann–Whitney U test was used. The groups differed significantly in terms of age (p=0.001), did not differ in terms of body height (p=0.529) or mass (p=0.233). Statistically significant differences (p<0.001) were marked by an asterix symbol (*). Each measurement of the left and right leg was also compared between the groups. The Kruskal–Wallis one-way analysis of variance by ranks was used and significant differences were those with p<0.001. When analyzing it has been noted that there was a statistically significant difference (p<0.001) between the torque value of muscles responsible for internal rotation (S40) when examining the right limb (after ACL reconstruction) in both groups. Significant differences were observed in all starting positions, as well as in both degrees of flexion – 30 and 900. Deficit of muscle strength on the right side – the injured one – when compared to the left was sometimes as high as 30%.
