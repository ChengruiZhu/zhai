Recently, whole body-electromyostimulation (WB-EMS) has upgraded its functions and capabilities and has overcome limitations and inconveniences from past systems. Although the efficacy and safety of EMS have been examined in some studies, specific guidelines for applying WB-EMS are lacking. To determine the efficacy and safety of applying it in healthy men to improve cardiopulmonary and psychophysiological variables when applying WB-EMS. Sixty-four participants were randomly grouped into control group (without electrical stimuli) or WB-EMS group after a 6-week baseline period. The control group (n=33; female. 15; male, 18) wore the WB-EMS suit as much as the WB-EMS group (n=31; female, 15; male, 16). There were no abnormal changes in the cardiopulmonary variables (heart rate, systolic blood pressure [SBP], diastolic blood pressure, and oxygen uptake) during or after the graded exercise test (GXT) in both groups. There was a significant decrease in SBP and an increase of oxygen uptake from stages 3 to 5 of the GXT in the WB-EMS group. The psychophysiological factors for a WB-EMS group, which consisted of soreness, anxiety, fatigability, and sleeplessness were significantly decreased after the experiment. The application of WB-EMS in healthy young men did not negatively affect the cardiopulmonary and psychophysiological factors. Rather, the application of WB-EMS improved SBP and oxygen uptake in submaximal and maximal stages of GXT. This study also confirmed that 6 weeks of WB-EMS training can improve psychophysiological factors.
