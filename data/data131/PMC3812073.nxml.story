β-defensins are small molecules, considered primarily to be antimicrobials and important in the first defence response to invading organisms. They are predominantly produced at surfaces in contact with the outside environment and these include skin, airway and reproductive tract. We show here that when we delete from the mouse a subset of nine β-defensin genes, surprisingly the main consequence is that the male mice are completely infertile. When normal sperm leave the male and enter the female reproductive tract they are triggered to undergo a reaction that alters the membrane properties of the sperm and allows fertilisation. We show here that sperm isolated from the male mice, that no longer make these β-defensins, are prematurely ready to fertilise an egg. It is far too early for this to happen and as a consequence the sperm are severely reduced in their ability to move and have a major defect in the structure of their tail. We provide evidence that the reason this has happened is due to a dysregulation of calcium transport. This work is important for understanding defensin gene function in a living organism and may enable the design of novel contraceptives with additional antibiotic ability.
