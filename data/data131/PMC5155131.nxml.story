The history of research on the exercise physiology of racehorses in Japan dates back to the 1930s. A research report entitled “Studies on exercise physiology
and performance testing of the racehorse”, published in 1933 by Shigeo Matsuba and Torao Shimamura of The University of Tokyo, was epoch-making and the most
important study in the history of equine exercise physiology in Japan. Research results were reported from 92 Thoroughbred racehorses in a large-scale project
during the period of 1928 to 1932 at the Shimofusa Imperial Farm and the Koiwai Farm, which were the two greatest racehorse farms at that time. A total of 20
physiological variables were measured to evaluate the fitness of Thoroughbred racehorses before exercise (Pre), just after exercise (Post), 1 hr after exercise
(1 hr), 2 hr after exercise (2 hr), and 3 hr after exercise (3 hr) in order to calculate their recovery rates as an index of fitness and performance. The
percentage of the Pre value at 1 hr, 2 hr, and 3 hr was calculated. When the percentage of a variable reached 95–105% of the Pre value, the variable was
considered to be recovered. The percentage of the total number of variables that were recovered for each time period was calculated, and an overall average was
calculated from them; Matsuba and Shimamura proposed calling this overall average the “recovery rate”, which could then be applied to evaluate each horse. The
effects of training on racehorses were subsequently evaluated by measuring the various physiological variables and the recovery rate.
