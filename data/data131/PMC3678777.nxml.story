It is rare for systemic non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma (NHL) to metastasize to the hypothalamus and pituitary glands. The present study describes two patients with NHL and diabetes insipidus (DI) and 17 patients from the literature in order to analyze the clinical features of patients with NHL metastasizing to the pituitary glands. Diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL) was observed to be the most common type of NHL involving the hypothalamus-pituitary axis. A total of 11 patients (57.9%) had been diagnosed with DI (post-pituitary involvement), five (26.3%) with anterior hypopituitarism and three (15.8%) with posterior and anterior hypopituitarism. Only two cases exhibited simultaneous endocrine and lymphoma manifestations; the majority of cases (68.4%) exhibited lymphoma manifestations first. To make an etiological diagnosis of NHL with metastases to the pituitary glands, it is necessary to find that NHL exists in other regions of patient’s body. Biopsy of the sellar may have significant meaning, but this examination may difficult to perform. Chemotherapy for NHL relieves pituitary impairment symptoms and improves the overall examination results. Additionally, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the pituitary gland has a certain differential diagnostic value as the T1- and T2-weighted imaging (WI) signals from patients with systemic NHL with pituitary involvement are low.
