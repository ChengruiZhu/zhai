Timely neutrophil apoptosis is an essential part of the resolution phase of acute inflammation. Ceruloplasmin, an acute-phase protein, which is the predominant copper-carrying protein in the blood, has been suggested to have a marked effect on neutrophil life span. The present work is a comparative study on the effects of intact holo-ceruloplasmin, its copper-free (apo-) and partially proteolyzed forms, and synthetic free peptides RPYLKVFNPR (883–892) and RRPYLKVFNPRR (882–893) on polymorphonuclear leukocyte (PMNL, neutrophil) oxidant status and apoptosis. The most pronounced effect on both investigated parameters was found with copper-containing samples, namely, intact and proteolyzed proteins. Both effectively reduced spontaneous and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α)-induced extracellular and intracellular accumulation of superoxide radicals, but induced a sharp increase in the oxidation of intracellular 2′,7′-dichlorofluorescein upon short exposure. Therefore, intact and proteolyzed ceruloplasmin have both anti- and pro-oxidant effects on PMNLs wherein the latter effect is diminished by TNF-α and lactoferrin. Additionally, all compounds investigated were determined to be inhibitors of delayed spontaneous apoptosis. Intact enzyme retained its pro-survival activity, whereas proteolytic degradation converts ceruloplasmin from a mild inhibitor to a potent activator of TNF-α-induced neutrophil apoptosis.
