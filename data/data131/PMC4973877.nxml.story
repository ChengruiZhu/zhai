A crucial aspect of all life is the ability to use past events in order to guide future behavior. To do that, creatures need the ability to predict future events. Indeed, predictability has been shown to affect neuronal responses in many animals and under many conditions. Clearly, the quality of predictions should depend on the amount and detail of the past information used to generate them. Here, by using a basic principle from information theory, we show how to derive explicitly the tradeoff between quality of prediction and complexity of the representation of past information. We then apply these ideas to a concrete caseâ€“neuronal responses recorded in auditory cortex during the presentation of oddball sequences, consisting of two tones with varying probabilities. We show that the neuronal responses fit quantitatively the prediction errors of optimal predictors derived from our theory, and use that result in order to deduce the properties of the representations of the past in the auditory system. We conclude that these memory representations have surprisingly long duration (10 stimuli back or more), but keep relatively little detail about this past. Our theory can be applied widely to other sensory systems.
