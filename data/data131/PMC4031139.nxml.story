The fundamental unit of chromatin is the nucleosome, which consists of 147 bp of DNA wrapped around a histone octamer containing four core histones (H3, H4, H2A, and H2B). Nucleosome positioning in the genome affects the DNA accessibility for regulatory proteins, and thus is critical for gene expression and regulation. Genomic regions associated with regulatory proteins are associated with a pronounced sensitivity to DNase I digestion, and are thus called DNase I hypersensitive sites (DHSs). It is well known that only a subset of nucleosomes are reproducibly positioned in eukaryotic genomes. However, it is less clear what factors determine genome-wide nucleosome positioning, especially in intergenic regions. We mapped both nucleosome positioning and DHS datasets across the rice genome. We discovered that DHSs located in a variety of contexts, both genic and intergenic, were flanked by strongly phased nucleosome arrays. We confirmed the same association of DHSs with phased nucleosomes in the human genome. We conclude that genomic loci associated with a diverse set of regulatory proteins are major determinants of nucleosome phasing, and this is true in both genic and intergenic regions.
