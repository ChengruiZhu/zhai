Among 564 couples contributing 1137.2 couple-years of observation, bacterial vaginosis was detected at 15.5% of study visits. Twenty-two of 106 seroconversions occurred during intervals after bacterial vaginosis was detected [12 on no method/nonhormonal method (nonhormonal contraception), two on injectables, eight on oral contraceptive pills (OCPs)]. Unadjusted seroincidence rates per 100 couple-years for nonhormonal contraception, injectable, and OCP users, respectively, during intervals with bacterial vaginosis were 8.3, 20.8, and 31.0 and during intervals without bacterial vaginosis were 8.2, 9.7, and 12.3. In the bacterial vaginosis-positive model, there was a significant increase in incident HIV among those using injectables (adjusted hazard ratio, aHR 6.55, 95% CI 1.14–37.77) and OCPs (aHR 5.20, 95% CI 1.68–16.06) compared with nonhormonal contraception. Hormonal contraception did not increase the hazard of HIV acquisition in bacterial vaginosis-negative models. These findings persisted in sensitivity analyses whenever all covariates from the nonstratified model previously published were included, whenever other genital tract findings were excluded from the model and with the addition of condom-less sex and sperm on wet-prep.
