Experimental and mathematical modeling analyses were used for controlling melt free-radical grafting of vinylic monomers on polyolefins and, thereby, reducing the disturbance of undesired cross-linking of polyolefins. Response surface, desirability function, and artificial intelligence methodologies were blended to modeling/optimization of grafting reaction in terms of vinylic monomer content, peroxide initiator concentration, and melt-processing time. An in-house code was developed based on artificial neural network that learns and mimics processing torque and grafting of glycidyl methacrylate (GMA) typical vinylic monomer on high-density polyethylene (HDPE). Application of response surface and desirability function enabled concurrent optimization of processing torque and GMA grafting on HDPE, through which we quantified for the first time competition between parallel reactions taking place during melt processing: (i) desirable grafting of GMA on HDPE; (ii) undesirable cross-linking of HDPE. The proposed robust mathematical modeling approach can precisely learn the behavior of grafting reaction of vinylic monomers on polyolefins and be placed into practice in finding exact operating condition needed for efficient grafting of reactive monomers on polyolefins.
