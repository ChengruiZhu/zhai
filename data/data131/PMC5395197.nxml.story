Ovarian cancer is one of the most lethal cancers in women due to the high prevalence of drug resistant disease. New insight into the biology causing drug resistance is required to reduce death rates associated with the disease. In many cancer types, chromosome instability (CIN; or abnormal numbers of chromosomes) is associated with aggressive tumours, the acquisition of multi-drug resistance and poor patient outcome, yet CIN is poorly characterized in ovarian cancer. Here, we employ a new microscopy-based approach to examine the presence and dynamics of CIN within single cells obtained from ovarian cancer patients collected over time. We show that CIN is associated with every sample and further show that increases in CIN are associated with treatment and/or the development of drug (platinum) resistant disease. Although additional studies are required, these findings suggest CIN may be a new biomarker that can monitor disease progression, particularly in response to therapy. Finally, we demonstrate that CIN is low in two cellular models of drug resistant disease. Collectively, our findings strengthen the need for studies employing patient-derived samples to accurately assess the abnormal biology associated with the disease, and cautions the use of these cell models in studies related to drug resistance that may arise from CIN.
