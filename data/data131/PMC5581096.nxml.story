Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) have recently emerged as new potentially promising therapeutic targets in many cancers. However, their prognostic value and biological functions associated with glioma remain to be elucidated. Here, High-throughput RNAseq was performed to detect the expression profiles of lncRNAs in 325 human glioma tissues. It was shown that a novel lncRNA HOXA-AS3 was one of the most significantly upregulated lncRNAs in glioma tissues. Quantitative PCR further verified the increased expression of HOXA-AS3 in patient samples and glioma cell lines. Uni and Multivariate Cox regression analysis revealed that HOXA-AS3 was an independent prognostic factor in glioma patients. Gene set enrichment analysis indicated that the gene sets correlated with HOXA-AS3 expression were involved in cell cycle progression and E2F targets. Functionally, HOXA-AS3 silencing resulted in proliferation arrest by altering cell cycle progression and promoting cell apoptosis, and impaired cell migration in glioma cells. Furthermore, the growth-inhibiting effect of HOXA-AS3 knockdown was also demonstrated in Xenograft mouse model. Our results highlight the important role of HOXA-AS3 in glioma progression, and indicate that HOXA-AS3 may be served as a valuable prognostic biomarker for glioma.
