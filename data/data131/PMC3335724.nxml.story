Dog attacks are extremely frequent and are thought to be responsible for an average of 250,000 minor injuries and emergency unit attendances each year. Children in particular are more likely to experience dog-bite injuries with 5â€“9-year olds most susceptible. The majority of injuries are to the head region, with the lips, cheeks, and nose often affected. Most injuries experienced are confined to the soft tissues; nevertheless, maxillofacial fracture is a potential albeit rare complication. The incidence of facial fractures in relation to dog bites is unknown; however, some have estimated that facial fractures could occur in 5% of dog attacks. However mandibular fracture following a dog bite is extremely rare, with review of the literature only identifying three cases. We present a further case in which a five-year-old sustained numerous soft-tissue lacerations to the face and hand, together with fracture of the mandibular symphysis following a dog attack. The fracture was successfully repaired using open reduction and internal fixation with titanium plates and screws. The case emphasises that although maxillofacial fracture is rare, it may occur following a dog bite and that thorough and systematic examination of the facial skeleton is crucial to exclude the presence of such injuries.
