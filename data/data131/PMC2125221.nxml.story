 (Bordet's test) was observed in some, and in others positive complement fixation and cross agglutination indicated the cholera nature of the vibrios in question. Although it cannot as yet be definitely proven, we are justified in suspecting that cholera-like vibrios which eventually develop agglutination properties are of a true cholera nature. It is probable that the production of agglutination antibodies in the serum brings about the development by the bacterial cell of defensive anti-agglutinins, resulting in the disappearance of agglutinating power. In the case of the water vibrios, changed physical conditions could bring about a similar alteration in biological properties. It may be said that the absence of agglutination in a vibrio isolated from a suspected source does not define conclusively its noncholera nature. In all probability among a number of cholera-like vibrios isolated from suspected sources a certain percentage will eventually be found to develop agglutination either during laboratory cultivation or by means of animal passage, and until subjected to a procedure that will induce the return of agglutination no vibrio can be regarded with assurance as of a truly saprophytic variety.
