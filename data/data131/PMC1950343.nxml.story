The amount of a given transcript or protein in a cell is determined by a balance of expression and repression in a complex network of biological processes. This delicate balance is compromised in complex genetic diseases such as cancer by alterations in the activation patterns of functionally important biological processes known as pathways. Over the last years, a large number of microarray experiments profiling the expression levels of more than 20,000 human genes in hundreds of tumor samples have shown that most cancer types are heterogeneous diseases, each characterized by many different expression subtypes. The biological and clinical goal is to explain the observed tumor and clinical heterogeneity in terms of specific patterns of altered pathways. The bioinformatic challenge is therefore to devise mathematical tools that explicitly attempt to infer these altered pathways. To this end, we applied a signal processing tool in a meta-analysis of breast cancer, encompassing more than 800 tumor specimens derived from four different patient cohorts, and showed that this algorithm significantly outperforms popular standard bioinformatics tools in identifying altered pathways underlying breast cancer. These results show that the same tool could be applied to other complex human genetic diseases to better elucidate the underlying altered pathways.
