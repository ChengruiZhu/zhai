Breast cancer progression is associated with dysregulated expression of the immunoglobulin superfamily (IgSF) genes that are involved in cell-cell recognition, binding and adhesion. Despite widespread evidence that many IgSF genes could serve as effective biomarkers, this potential has not been realized because the studies have focused mostly on individual genes and not the entire network. To gain a global perspective of the IgSF-related biomarkers, we constructed an IgSF-directed neighbor network (IDNN) and an IgSF-directed driver network (IDDN) by integrating multiple levels of data, including IgSF genes, breast cancer driver genes, protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks and gene expression profiling data. Our study shows that IgSF genes in the PPI network have important topological features related to cancer. Most IgSF genes are either cancer driver genes themselves or associated with them. We also identified a 21-gene IgSF network module with enriched mutations that are associated with overall survival based on 450 breast cancer patient samples extracted from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and multiple independent microarray validation datasets. These results highlight the potential of IgSF genes as novel diagnostic, prognostic and therapeutic targets for breast cancer.
