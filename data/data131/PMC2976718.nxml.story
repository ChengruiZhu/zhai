Genes are known to control the shape of biological structures, like flowers, hearts, and limbs, yet how they do this is poorly understood. A working hypothesis is that genes control shape by modulating local rates at which growing tissue deforms. Evaluating this idea has been difficult, however, because of the dynamic interactions that occur within growing and deforming tissue. To address this problem, we used a combination of experimental and mathematical modelling approaches to study how genes control shape in the Snapdragon flower. This system has the advantages of having well defined genes that influence shape and being accessible to growth analysis. We first tried to explain the experimental data with a model in which genes influence local rates of tissue growth. While this model could capture many aspects of flower development, it failed to account for some key features. These could be most readily explained if genes also affect an internal field of orientations along which growth is directed, established by organisers of tissue polarity. Our analysis therefore revealed a previously unsuspected role of shape genes in the control of tissue polarity, highlighting the importance of this process for the development and evolution of tissue forms.
