While Aurora-A (Aur A) provokes, BRCA2 restrains primary tumorigenesis, the roles of Aur A and BRCA2 in cancer metastasis remains unclear. Here, we show that the metastatic promoting markers SLUG, FBN1, and MMP2, 9, 13 are either stimulated or suppressed by Aur A or BRCA2, but the metastatic suppressors E-cadherin, β-catenin, and p53 are either inhibited or promoted by Aur A or BRCA2, leading to enhanced or reduced cell migration and invasion. Further study suggests that FBN1 inhibits E-cadherin and β-catenin, but stimulates MMP2, 9, 13. Depletion of SLUG abrogates FBN1 and MMP9, but increases E-cadherin, while p53 decreases both SLUG and FBN1. Animal assays demonstrate that FBN1 promotes both ovarian tumorigenesis and metastasis. Clinically, overexpression of BRCA2 or Aur A in ovarian cancer tissues predicts good or poor overall and disease free survivals. High expression of SLUG or FBN1 indicates poor overall survivals, whereas high expression of FBN1 but not of SLUG predicts poor disease free survival. No significant associations between p53 expression and patient survivals were found. Overall, FBN1, acts at the downstream of Aur A and BRCA2, promotes ovarian cancer metastasis through the p53 and SLUG-associated signaling, which may be useful for ovarian cancer diagnosis and treatment.
