Current literature focuses on the complications and treatment of Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM) while clustering environmental and genetic factors to explain the disease. Interventions proposed to reduce diabetes prevalence should focus predominantly on initiating active rapports of family members and promoting a more communication-oriented preventative approach between diabetics and non-diabetics. Due to varying risks in T2DM by race and ethnicity, these populations should follow race-appropriate guidelines to prevent further T2DM occurrence and complications. The review consists of information related to the genetic component of T2DM to help identify high-risk groups and focuses on the environmental aspect of the disease to help consider appropriate techniques to reduce disease burden. Genetic factors play important roles in the pathogenesis of diabetes and thus are an essential element of understanding the cause of the disease and possible methods of prevention. Focusing on high-risk groups with T2DM could have profound effects on the current health care situation. In this review, we discuss the epidemiology of diabetes in the United States and propose methods of preventing and delaying the development of T2DM in high-risk individuals.
