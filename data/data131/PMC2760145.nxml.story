The human genome is comprised of the DNA base sequences used by the cell as a blueprint to direct proper cellular function. Changes in this sequence, known as genomic instability, often interfere with vital cellular functions, resulting in genetic disorders. Repetitive DNA sequences are particularly susceptible to genomic instability. Trinucleotide repeat disorders are caused by three base repeat sequences that increase in size when passed from parent to child and during aging. Trinucleotide repeat expansion results in disease when the size of the repeat sequence increases into the pathogenic size range. Our understanding of the mechanisms responsible for these repeat length changes is incomplete and modeling repeat expansion in human cells has proven difficult. Here, we have developed a unique human cellular model of GAA·TTC trinucleotide repeat expansion, the causative mutation in Friedreich ataxia. Using this model, we characterize GAA·TTC expansion in human cells and identify gene transcription as a key regulator of GAA·TTC repeat expansion. The findings of this study provide novel insight into the mechanisms contributing to trinucleotide repeat expansion in human cells and present new implications for certain therapeutic approaches in Friedreich ataxia.
