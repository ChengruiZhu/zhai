MHC class I molecules present antigenic peptides derived from endogenously expressed foreign or aberrant protein molecules to the outside world so that they can be specifically recognised by cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) at the cell surface. Responsible for the generation of these peptides is the 20S proteasome, which is the major proteolytic enzyme of the cell. These peptides were so far believed to exhibit a linear sequence identical to that found in the unprocessed parental protein. Using patient derived CTL it was previously shown that by proteasome catalyzed peptide splicing, i.e., by fusion of two proteasome generated peptide fragments in a reversed proteolysis reaction, novel spliced antigenic peptides can be generated. To resolve the CTL dependence of spliced-peptide identification we here performed experiments, which combined mass spectrometric analysis of proteasome generated peptides with a computer based algorithm that predicts the masses of all theoretically possible spliced peptides from a given substrate molecule (SpliceMet). Using this unrestricted approach we here identified several new spliced peptides of which some were derived from two distinct substrate molecules. Our data reveal that peptide splicing is an intrinsic additional catalytic property of the proteasome, which may provide a qualitatively new peptide pool for immune selection.
