The mixed dentition is the developmental period after the permanent first molars and incisors have erupted, and before the remaining deciduous teeth are lost. Phase I treatment is usually done early in this period. Mixed dentition treatment goals often focus on skeletal rather than dental correction. To design a treatment plan, the clinician must understand the growth and development patterns, and the known effects of the chosen treatment modality. Jaw growth affects orthodontic treatment, usually favorably, but sometimes unfavorably. When and how much growth will occur is completely unpredictable. However, we know some useful facts about jaw growth in the mixed dentition. The two areas that remain controversial in the orthodontic literature are the treatment of crowding and of Class II malocclusions in the mixed dentition. Is there a benefit to early treatment for these problems? This question has yet to be fully answered by researchers. Hence, we planned for review of all available literature to come to a consensus about preventive or interceptive orthodontics or in other words Phase 1 and Phase 2 treatment. The clinician can diagnose and intercept certain developing problems with early treatment. Many other cases should be supervised, but not treated until the permanent teeth are in place. We must base our decision to treat on experience, knowledge of growth and dental development, and research.
