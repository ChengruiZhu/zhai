Active matter systems have the distinct ability to convert energy from their surroundings into mechanical work, which gives rise to them having highly dynamic properties. Modeling active matter systems and capturing their complex behavior has been a great challenge in past years due to the many coupled interactions between their constituent parts, including not only distinct chemical and mechanical properties, but also feedback between them. One of the most intriguing biological active matter systems is the cell cytoskeleton, which can dynamically respond to chemical and mechanical cues to control cell structure and shape, playing a central role in many higher-order cellular processes. To model these systems and reproduce their behavior, we present a new modeling approach which combines the chemical, mechanical, and molecular transport aspects of active matter systems, all represented with equivalent complexity, while also allowing for various forms of mechanochemical feedback. This modeling approach, named MEDYAN, and software implementation is flexible so that a wide range of active matter systems can be simulated with a high level of detail, and ultimately can help to describe active matter phenomena, and in particular, the dynamics of the cell cytoskeleton. In this work, we have used MEDYAN to simulate a cytoskeletal network consisting of actin filaments, cross-linking proteins, and myosin II molecular motors. We found that these systems show rich dynamical behaviors, undergoing alignment and bundling transitions, with an emergent contractility, as the concentrations of myosin II and cross-linking proteins, as well as actin filament turnover rates, are varied.
