P73, the homolog of p53, exists in 2 major forms: either as a pro-apoptotic TAp73 or an amino-terminally truncated DNp73, the latter lacking the first transactivation domain. While TAp73s tumor suppressive functions have been established, DNp73 is an anti-apoptotic protein conferring chemoresistance and is associated with poor survival. However, both forms are variably overexpressed in many human cancers. In this context, we have recently demonstrated that TAp73 is stabilized by hypoxia, a tumor-relevant condition that is associated with cell survival, via HIF-1α-mediated suppression of Siah1 E3 ligase that degrades TAp73. Consequently, hypoxic signals lead to TAp73-mediated activation of several angiogenic genes and blood vessel formation, thereby supporting tumorigenesis. We show here that, similar to TAp73, DNp73 is stabilized by hypoxia in a HIF-1α-dependent manner, which otherwise is degraded by Siah1. Moreover, DNp73 is capable of inducing the expression of Vegf-A, the prototypic angiogenic gene, and loss of DNp73 expression results in reduction in tumor vasculature and size. These data therefore indicate a common mode of regulation for both p73 forms by hypoxia, resulting in the promotion of angiogenesis and tumor growth, highlighting common functionality of these antagonistic proteins under specific physiological contexts.
