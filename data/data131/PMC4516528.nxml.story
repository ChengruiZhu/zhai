= 0.46), a plasminogen activator over-expressed in inflamed joints and known to exhibit potent arthritogenic properties. Here we evaluate the functional relationship between these proteins using primary synovial fibroblasts and leucocytes of RA patients, human monocytic (THP-1) and fibroblast (MRC-5) cell lines. Using inhibitors of intracellular signalling, we show that uPA and survivin share common transduction pathways in synovial fibroblasts being dependent on the activity of tyrosine kinases, phosphatidylinositide 3 kinase and mitogen effector kinase. Moreover, uPA production is significantly reduced in fibroblasts if survivin synthesis has been silenced by siRNA. Importantly, silencing of survivin in fibroblasts prevented their invasive growth in knee joints of severe combined immune deficient mice. Interaction of uPA with receptor up-regulates survivin expression in leucocytes. In turn, survivin is required for the up-regulation of uPA receptor on the cell surface. These findings indicate that survivin is an essential mediator of arthritogenic properties of uPA regulating its synthesis in synovial fibroblasts and uPAR expression in leucocytes. Close correlation between survivin and uPA levels in patients with RA supports the importance of this connection for the pathogenesis of arthritis.
