The construction of phylogenetic trees, which depict past relationships between groups of DNA or protein sequences, has valuable application in many fields of study, most commonly evolutionary and population biology. Before drawing conclusions from phylogenetic trees, it is important to assess how accurate those reconstructions are. This is typically accomplished by examining measures of “clade credibility” (such as bootstrap or posterior probability values), which represent how reproducible relationships are within the tree based on the parameters of the phylogenetic analysis. However, such measures do not necessarily reflect how likely inferred relationships are to have actually occurred in nature. Therefore, using simulated data where relationships are known, we have determined how well several measures of clade credibility correlate with the likelihood that a deduced phylogenetic grouping actually exists in reality. Surprisingly, we found no such correlation, and that the inferred relationships were correctly assigned about as often in cases where clade credibility values were very low as where they were high. This finding suggests that current measures of phylogenetic tree reliability are not useful in predicting whether specific inferred relationships have actually occurred.
