One of the most profound outcomes of fast, reliable genome sequencing is the ability to tailor drug therapy to an individual’s genotype. This ‘personalized’ or ‘precision medicine’ is the realization of a decades-long effort to maximize drug effect and limit unwanted side effects. An undesirable consequence of such targeted therapies, however, is the emergence of drug resistance. This outcome is the result of an evolutionary process where mutations in the drug target render the drug perturbation allow such mutant cells to proliferate. Because of the unbiased, and stochastic nature of the emergence of drug resistance, it is impossible to predict. We developed a test where hundreds of thousands of mutant cells are exposed to a drug simultaneously and those cells that modulate resistance survive. This method is innovative because it partners a high-throughput experimental protocol with a tailored statistical model to identify all mutations that modulate resistance. Finally, we used synthetic biology to re-create these mutations and demonstrate that they were, in fact, bona fide drug-resistant variants. These mutations were further extended and confirmed to also be resistant in the human orthologue. This combined biological-computational approach allows one to identify drug’s degree of resistance to both guide treatments and future drug discovery.
