The fine-tuned activities of stem cells are essential for embryonic development and organ maintenance. All types of stem cells share the abilities to self-renew and differentiate into specific cell-types, though the stem cells of different organs have distinct gene expression profiles and competences. Despite these unifying properties, to what extent diverse populations of stem cells utilize similar regulatory mechanisms remains unclear. To address this issue, we map the binding pattern of the key stem cell transcription factor SOX2 in the developing cortex, spinal cord, stomach and lung/esophagus. We find that, even though the core DNA-sequence it targets is similar in all tissues, its binding location is highly divergent and reflects the gene expression profile of each cell type. Moreover, DNA-regions targeted by SOX2 are enriched for binding motifs of distinct co-factors in each tissue, which we demonstrate can physically and functionally interact with SOX2. Consistent with these findings, DNA-regions bound specifically in cells of one germ layer are capable of driving fluorescent reporter gene expression in corresponding zebrafish tissues. Finally, we demonstrate that proliferation genes are bound by SOX2 in all examined tissues, and that cell division is controlled via a common mechanism in neural and endodermal cells. These findings provide a striking example of how a single transcription factor regulates both core and specific stem cell processes in multiple cellular contexts.
