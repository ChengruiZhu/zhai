Of 189 eligible patients, we included 50 RPV switchers and 139 NVP controls. Week 12 HIV-RNA was <50 copies/mL in 46/50 switchers (92.0%) which was not different from the hypothesized 90% week 12 suppression rate (p=.431). Forty-four of 50 switchers had week 24 HIV-1 RNA <50 copies/mL compared to 126/139 controls (difference: 2.6%, 95% CI −7.6% to 12.8%, p=.593). NVP plasma concentrations were below detection level in all at week 3. Mean week 1 RPV trough concentration was 0.083 mg/L and comparable to phase III trial data (p=0.747). Adverse events occurred in 36 switchers, the majority (82.0%) were grade one. Two switchers discontinued RPV for side effects. Significant changes over 24 weeks (p<0.001) were observed in switchers on total cholesterol (TC, −0.67 mmol/L, 95% CI −0.50 to 0.83), low density lipoprotein (LDL)-C (−0.36, 95% CI −0.21 to −0.51) and high density lipoprotein (HDL)-C (−0.28, 95% CI −0.20 to −0.35). The TC/HDL-C ratio increased 0.20 (95% CI 0.02 to 0.37; p=.029) and systolic blood pressure decreased 6.0 mmHg (95% CI −1.7 to −10.3; p=.007). The median FRS did not change over 24 weeks (8.4% vs. 7.7%; p=.119). More patients achieved LDL-C (+15%; p=.016) and TC (+25%; p<0.001) ATP-III treatment goals at week 24 on RPV.
