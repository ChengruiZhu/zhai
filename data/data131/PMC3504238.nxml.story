Cavernous transformation is a condition which has an acutely developing harmful effect over intestinal circulation compromising the patients' life before development of portal hypertension and its results. We present the case of phrenic artery hemorrhage after successful percutaneous portal vein stenting to treat cavernous transformation following LDLT. The patient survived the hazard complication with prompt surgery. Three factors may be related to the rare complication in the case were analyzed, including affluent new vessels around the diaphragm related to LDLT procedure, high puncture site allowing the diaphragm been injured, and anticoagulation given before the puncture and soon after the procedure. Cautions should be taken for the interventional procedures in this extreme condition. Cavernous transformation is a condition which has an acutely developing harmful effect over intestinal circulation compromising the patients' life before development of portal hypertension and its results (see the work of Harmanci and Bayraktar (2007)). It is even worse when this happens in a patient after LDLT (living donor liver transplantation). Herein we have presented a case of phrenic artery hemorrhage after successful percutaneous portal vein stenting to treat cavernous transformation following LDLT. The patient survived the hazard complication with prompt surgery.
