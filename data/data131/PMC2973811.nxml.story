Gene expression needs to respond to changes in conditions, but also varies stochastically among cells in a homogenous environment. It has been argued that these two levels of expression variation may be coupled, relating to the same underlying molecular mechanisms. However, such a strong coupling between expression “plasticity” and expression “noise” may introduce cost–benefit conflicts during evolution. For example, if plasticity is beneficial, but noise is detrimental, then coupling will be disfavored. In this work, evidence is presented that such cost–benefit conflicts do occur and that they constrain the evolution of gene expression in yeast. In contrast to recent conclusions, it is shown that noise–plasticity coupling is not a general result, but rather one associated with particular mechanisms of transcription initiation. Promoter architectures associated with coupling are avoided when noise is detrimental, and noise and plasticity are not coupled for core cellular components. Noise–plasticity coupling is therefore not a general property of gene expression, but an evolvable trait that may constrain the evolution of gene expression and be selected against during evolution. Further, gene duplication may facilitate escape from the adaptive conflict imposed by coupling.
