MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small, non-coding RNAs that regulate important cellular processes by inhibiting the expression of gene targets. In recent years, it has become clear that miRNAs play a critical role in the regulation of the immune response to infection, a highly complex phenotype involving the activation of both generic and infection-specific responses. However, it remains unclear to what extent miRNAs are involved in the regulation of these two types of response. Here, focusing on the miRNA response to mycobacteria, pathogens of major public health importance, we present the first comparative, deep sequencing-based analysis of the miRNA response to a panel of bacterial infections. We define a set of miRNAs that play an essential role in basic cellular responses to stress and identify pathogen-specific miRNA responses that reflect mechanisms by which certain pathogens interfere with the host response to infection. In addition, we show that infection can alter the expression level and proportions of miRNA isoforms, transcripts originating from the same miRNA but with slight differences in their nucleotide sequences. This study highlights a novel aspect of miRNA expression dynamics upon infection and increases our understanding of miRNA-mediated mechanisms involved in host cellular responses to infection.
