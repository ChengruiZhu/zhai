Malformations of vascular nature originate as anomalies caused due to errors in vasculogenesis. These tumors are generally broadly classified into vascular tumors (hemangiomas) and vascular malformations (venous malformations, arteriovenous malformations, lymphatic malformations). These descriptive tumors and malformations have been categorized based on the architectural assembly of vessels. Lymphangiomas are further subclassified microscopically into capillary, cavernous, cystic and lymphangioendothelioma, depending upon their histopathological features. Lymphatic malformations or lymphangiomas are uncommon congenital malformations of the lymphatic system, usually occurring in the head and neck region, characterized by collections of ectatic lymph vessels that form endothelial lined cystic spaces. Advancements in the knowledge of pathogenesis of such vascular malformations are continuously changing their treatment protocols. Early recognition is of utmost importance for initiation of proper treatment and avoiding serious complications. Hemangiolymphangioma is a variant of lymphangioma showing vascular component. Herewith, we present a case of vascular malformation diagnosed as hemangiolymphangioma histopathologically in a 9-year-old girl, along with a review of literature regarding its categorization.
