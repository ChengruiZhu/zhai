The study focuses on polyherbal antidiabetic formulations of different plants used in the treatment of diabetes mixed in different concentrations. In the present study eleven medicinal plants with proven antidiabetic and related beneficial effects were selected for the preparation of five mixtures. The efficacy of prepared mixtures has been tested on streptozotocin- (STZ-) induced diabetic rats and compared with a commercially available drug glibenclamide. The mixtures at the dose levels of 400 mg/kg b.w. produced a significant decrease in blood glucose level by 69.6%, 70.97%, 64.45%, 71.82%, and 64.44% after 21 days of treatment. The elevated level of SGPT, SGOT, and ALP in the diabetic controlled group reflected the significant alteration of liver function by STZ induction and was found to be equipotent to glibenclamide in restoration of the elevated enzyme levels to normal. The elevated lipid levels (triglyceride and total cholesterol) were restored to near normal by these mixtures for all the estimated parameters. The results of the mixtures on treated group were found to restore the glycemic level to the near normal level thereby indicating antihyperglycemic activity of the formulated mixtures.
