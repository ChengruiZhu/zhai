 (metastasis) assays, as well as genetic and biochemical approaches to address this question in B16F10 murine melanoma cells. CAV1 promoted directional migration on fibronectin or laminin, two abundant lung extracellular matrix (ECM) components, which correlated with enhanced Y14 phosphorylation during spreading. Moreover, CAV1-driven migration, invasion, TEM and metastasis were ablated by expression of the phosphorylation null CAV1(Y14F), but not the phosphorylation mimicking CAV1(Y14E) mutation. Finally, CAV1-enhanced focal adhesion dynamics and surface expression of beta1 integrin were required for CAV1-driven TEM. Importantly, CAV1 function as a tumor suppressor in tumor formation assays was not altered by the Y14F mutation. In conclusion, our results provide critical insight to the mechanisms of CAV1 action during cancer development. Specific ECM-integrin interactions and Y14 phosphorylation are required for CAV1-enhanced melanoma cell migration, invasion and metastasis to the lung. Because Y14F mutation diminishes metastasis without inhibiting the tumor suppressor function of CAV1, Y14 phosphorylation emerges as an attractive therapeutic target to prevent metastasis without altering beneficial traits of CAV1.
