Improvement of screening programs and new treatment strategies against cervical cancer (CC) have increased survival rates of patients in the last decades. As more women survive this type of cancer, their quality of life (QOL) has become a field of great scientific and social importance. Different types of therapy have varying results on the QOL of patients. In this study, we compared the impact of radiotherapy (RAD) and radiochemotherapy (RAD/CHEM) on CC patients’ QOL. Our sample included 105 women who suffered from CC stages IA–IIIA. They were treated either with RAD or RAD/CHEM, and filled in the questionnaires 1 year after treatment completion. We used 4 questionnaires, EORTC QLQ C-30, EORTC QLQ-C24, Questionnaire of Post-traumatic Psychological Disorder, and Greek Symptom Control Questionnaire by M.D. Anderson, in order to assess their QOL. Except for differences in descriptive characteristics of the patients’ (age, number of children, contraceptives) and early toxicity in some organs, no statistically significant difference was observed in the main (physical, sexual, emotional) aspects of life between the 2 groups of treated patients. Treatment type had no effect on total QOL. In conclusion, the addition of CHEM to RAD in the treatment plan of CC patients had no significant impact on their QOL.
