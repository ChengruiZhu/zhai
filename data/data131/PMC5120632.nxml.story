Cutaneous T-cell lymphomas (CTCL) are a heterogeneous and relatively rare group of non-Hodgkin lymphomas arising from neoplastic skin-homing memory T cells. There is no known cure for CTCL, and current treatments focus on achieving and maintaining remission, controlling symptoms, limiting toxicities and maintaining or improving quality of life. Patients with CTCL often suffer from pruritus (itching), which can be debilitating and can have a significant impact on physical well-being and quality of life. Although progress has been made towards understanding the mechanisms of pruritus, the pathophysiology of CTCL-related pruritus remains unclear. Currently, there is neither a step-wise treatment algorithm for CTCL nor a standardized approach to treating pruritus in patients with CTCL. Treatments which specifically target pruritus have been reported with varying effectiveness. However, systemic treatments that target CTCL have the potential to alleviate pruritus by treating the underlying disease. Several systemic CTCL treatments have reported anti-pruritic properties, some in both objective responders and nonresponders, but the lack of a standardized method to measure and report pruritus makes it difficult to compare the effectiveness of systemic treatments. In this review, we provide an overview of approved and investigational systemic CTCL treatments that report anti-pruritic properties. For each study, the methods used to measure and report pruritus, as well as the study design are examined so that the clinical benefits of each systemic treatment can be more readily evaluated.
