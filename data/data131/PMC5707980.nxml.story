There are periodical norovirus-associated acute gastroenteritis outbreaks around the world. This study aimed to analyze the molecular and epidemiological features of norovirus infections in China during 2006–2016. We extracted epidemiological data from 132 norovirus outbreaks and the norovirus genotyping for 1291 sequences in China over the past ten years. A total of 132 norovirus outbreaks (8133 cases) were reported in China, where the east and south regions were most affected [47.7% (63/132)]. The highest number of outbreaks occurred in 2015. A seasonal pattern has been observed, with a peak from November to the following March. Most of the outbreaks occurred in middle and primary schools, accounting for 28.8% (38/132), and 28.0% (37/132) of outbreaks, respectively. The dominant age group was 10 to 19 years old, responsible for 75.7% (933/1232) of cases. Generally, the dominant genotypes was GII, for 81.9% (1058/1291) of sequences. G II.4 was the predominant genotype in China from 2004 to 2014. However, the GII.17 became more prevalent starting in 2014. Norovirus-associated acute gastroenteritis increased sharply in recent years caused by the emergence of GII.17, but epidemiological features have not changed during 2006–2016. Vigilant surveillance should be strengthened to promptly detect any variation.
