The predictive roles of human equilibrative nucleoside transporter 1 (hENT-1) in patients who undergo curative resection and adjuvant chemotherapy with gemcitabine alone have not been established. The present study retrospectively analyzed the clinical data from 101 consecutive patients who underwent curative resection and who received gemcitabine adjuvant chemotherapy for the treatment of pancreatic cancer at Kanagawa Cancer Center (Yokohama, Japan) between 2005 and 2014. The associations between the hENT-1 status and the survival and clinicopathological features of the patients were investigated. Of the 101 patients, 60 patients (59.4%) had high levels of hENT-1 expression. A significant association was observed between hENT-1 status and sex; however, for all the other clinicopathological parameters, including tumor and node stages, no differences were observed between the high and low hENT-1 expression groups. The median follow-up period of the present study was 67.3 months. Between the high and low hENT-1 expression groups, there was a statistically significant difference in the 5-year overall survival (OS) rates following surgery (20.6 and 8.9%, respectively; P=0.019). In addition, a significant difference was observed in the recurrence-free survival (RFS) rates at 5 years following surgery (P=0.049). hENT-1 status was one of the important predictive factors for OS and RFS in patients with pancreatic cancer who underwent curative resection followed by adjuvant chemotherapy with gemcitabine. Adjuvant chemotherapy with gemcitabine alone may be insufficient, particularly in patients with certain relevant risk factors.
