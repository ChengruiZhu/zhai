Understanding how genetic variation controls phenotypic variation is a fundamental goal of biology in both modern medicine and agriculture. Yet, frequently, even a large set of genetic polymorphisms do not fully explain variance of a phenotype within a discrete set of individuals. Numerous mechanistic theories have been proposed, e.g. epigenetics, but we postulated that there may be genome-wide polymorphism controlling phenotype stochastic noise among genotypes. This is similar to what is being found in studies of bet-hedging theory in prokaryotic or single-celled organisms or stability in eukaryotes. Utilizing Arabidopsis, we tested this hypothesis at a genomic level by mapping quantitative trait loci for stochastic noise in global transcriptomics, plant defense metabolism, circadian clock oscillation, and flowering time within a single non-stressful environment. We cloned and validated a set of genes including transcription factors and enzymes that control natural variation in phenotypic noise. These genes provided evidence that stochastic noise can vary independently of average phenotypes. Since population genetic models and quantitative genetic studies focus on natural genetic variations impact upon average phenotypes, these observations suggest that stochastic noise needs to be incorporated to better explain the genotype-to-phenotype link.
