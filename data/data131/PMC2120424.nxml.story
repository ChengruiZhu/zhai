The sorting of apical and basolateral proteins into vesicular carriers takes place in the trans-Golgi network (TGN) in MDCK cells. We have previously analyzed the protein composition of immunoisolated apical and basolateral transport vesicles and have now identified a component that is highly enriched in apical vesicles. Isolation of the encoding cDNA revealed that this protein, annexin XIIIb, is a new isoform of the epithelial specific annexin XIII sub-family which includes the previously described intestine-specific annexin (annexin XIIIa; Wice, B. M., and J. I. Gordon. 1992. J. Cell Biol. 116:405-422). Annexin XIIIb differs from annexin XIIIa in that it contains a unique insert of 41 amino acids in the NH2 terminus and is exclusively expressed in dog intestine and kidney. Immunofluorescence microscopy demonstrated that annexin XIIIb was localized to the apical plasma membrane and underlying punctate structures. Since annexins have been suggested to play a role in membrane-membrane interactions in exocytosis and endocytosis, we investigated whether annexin XIIIb is involved in delivery to the apical cell surface. To this aim we used permeabilized MDCK cells and a cytosol-dependent in vitro transport assay. Antibodies specific for annexin XIIIb significantly inhibited the transport of influenza virus hemagglutinin from the TGN to the apical plasma membrane while the transport of vesicular stomatitis virus glycoprotein to the basolateral cell surface was unaffected. We propose that annexin XIIIb plays a role in vesicular transport to the apical plasma membrane in MDCK cells.
