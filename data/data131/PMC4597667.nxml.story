The mean ages of athletes(n=25) and sedentary(n=25) were 21,36±2,07 and 21,64±1,62 years, weight 82,36±1,75 and 79,48±7,41kg, height 1,81±0,65 and 1,77±0,56cm, and body mass index were 24,99±4,07 and 25,20±2,12kg/cm2, respectively. They were all male and students of Yeditepe University. The athletes were in the soccer and American football teams of the university. All gave their own written consent to participate in the test protocols of the study voluntarily.Their lower extremity (LE) muscle power (JTech Myometry), and the flexibility of the LE antigravity muscles were assessed before. Their DB (Prokin PK 200) of both sides, speed and acceleration in 30m sprint (Research Tracker RT6) were assessed as before and after the KT applications on both calves to observe their immediate effects on the gastrosoleus group of muscles (p<0.05). The Y shaped KT were used starting from Achilles tendon as one piece and ending over medial and lateral heads of M.Gastrocnemius. Descriptive statistics were used to understand the physical properties of the participants. Wilcoxon and Mann-Whitney-U tests were used for the significance (p< 0.05) of the data and Pearson Correlation was used to understand the relation between the data.
