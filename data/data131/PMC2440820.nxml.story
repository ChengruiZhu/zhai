Many neurons are known to achieve a wide dynamic range by adaptively changing their computational input/output function according to the input statistics. These adaptive changes can be very rapid, and it has been suggested that a component of this adaptation could be purely input-driven: even a fixed neural system can show apparent adaptive behavior since inputs with different statistics interact with the nonlinearity of the system in different ways. In this paper, we show how a single neuron's intrinsic computational function can dictate such input-driven changes in its response to varying input statistics, which begets a relationship between two different characterizations of neural functionâ€”in terms of mean firing rate and in terms of generating precise spike timing. We then apply our results to two biophysically defined model neurons, which have significantly different response patterns to inputs with various statistics. Our model of intrinsic adaptation explains their behaviors well. Contrary to the picture that neurons carry out a stereotyped computation on their inputs, our results show that even in the simplest cases they have simple yet effective mechanisms by which they can adapt to their input. Adaptation to stimulus statistics, therefore, is built into the most basic single neuron computations.
