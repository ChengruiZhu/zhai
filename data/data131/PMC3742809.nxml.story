Pancreatic cancer (PC) remains a devastating disease with a five-year survival rate of <5%. The difficulty in making an early diagnosis and the frequent occurrence of metastasis are important reasons for this poor prognosis. In China, the incidence of PC has been increasing steadily. Therefore, the present study aimed to identify effective markers in the early and advanced stages of PC. The expression levels of complement C3, complement C4b1 and apolipoprotein E (ApoE) in the various stages of PC were assessed by immunohistochemistry, RT-PCR and western blotting. Additionally, the statistical significance of the results was analyzed. The expression levels of complement C3, complement C4b1 and apoE were higher in PC compared with normal pancreatic tissues. No correlations were observed between complement C3 and tumor TNM staging or lymph node metastasis. However, complement C4b1 and apoE were markedly correlated with tumor TNM staging and lymph node metastasis. Complement C3 may be used as a marker for the diagnosis of early-stage PC, while complement C4b1 and apoE are closely correlated with tumor development, reflecting the biological behavior of PC, and thus may be used as diagnostic markers of advanced PC.
