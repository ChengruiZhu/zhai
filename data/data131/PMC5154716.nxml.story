There is a substantial body of recent evidence showing ergogenic effects of carbohydrate (CHO) mouth rinsing on endurance performance. However, there is a lack of research on the dose-effect and the aim of this study was to investigate the effect of two different concentrations (6% and 12% weight/volume, w/v) on 90 minute treadmill running performance. Seven active males took part in one familiarization trial and three experimental trials (90-minute self-paced performance trials). Solutions (placebo, 6% or 12% CHO-electrolyte solution, CHO-E) were rinsed in the mouth at the beginning, and at 15, 30 and 45 minutes during the run. The total distance covered was greater during the CHO-E trials (6%, 14.6 ± 1.7 km; 12%, 14.9 ± 1.6 km) compared to the placebo trial (13.9 ± 1.7 km, P < 0.05). There was no significant difference between the 6% and 12% trials (P > 0.05). There were no between trial differences (P > 0.05) in ratings of perceived exertion (RPE) and feeling or arousal ratings suggesting that the same subjective ratings were associated with higher speeds in the CHO-E trials. Enhanced performance in the CHO-E trials was due to higher speeds in the last 30 minutes even though rinses were not provided during the final 45 minutes, suggesting the effects persist for at least 20–45 minutes after rinsing. In conclusion, mouth rinsing with a CHO-E solution enhanced endurance running performance but there does not appear to be a dose-response effect with the higher concentration (12%) compared to a standard 6% solution.
