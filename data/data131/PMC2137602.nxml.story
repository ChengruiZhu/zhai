, comprised the early synthesis of large amounts of the 7S γ-2 globulin antibody to the same level attained during the primary response. The secondary response to the phage consisted in the synthesis of 7S, γ-2 globulin antibody alone. Treatment of the macroglobulin phage-neutralizing antibody with mercaptoethanol resulted in complete loss of its neutralizing activity. A working hypothesis to explain these observations was presented. A salient feature of this hypothesis was the suggestion that different cells synthesized the two distinct molecular forms of antibody. The significance of the sequential synthesis of the two forms of antibody is not known. It was proposed that the system for synthesis of macroglobulin antibody is an auxiliary system for antibody synthesis, perhaps the first to develop phylogenetically and ontogenetically. It is felt that the present observations indicate a clear-cut qualitative distinction between the primary and secondary responses to immunization whereby these responses might be identified in various experimental situations. It is also felt that these findings with the primary and secondary responses to various antigens in the rabbit may be of widespread occurrence in nature among a variety of species.
