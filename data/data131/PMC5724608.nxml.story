 from the TPS values for the smallest of the fields tested. Relative distributions for small off axis fields were found to be in good agreement. A process for the routine clinical verification of IMRT fields has been implemented. Each IMRT field in an inverse plan is imported into a flat water tank plan and a “beam's eye view” (BEV) dose distribution is generated. This is compared to the corresponding measured BEV dose distribution. The IMRT verification process has also been performed using an anthropomorphic phantom. Large clinical fields (i.e., greater than 14.5 cm in the leaf direction) caused difficulties due to a vendor specific machine restriction, and several techniques for dealing with these were examined. These techniques were (i) the use of static stepping of closed junctions, (ii) the use of two separate IMRT fields for a given gantry angle, and (iii) restricting the overall maximum field size used. The overall process has allowed implementation of an in‐house protocol for IMRT use on an initial clinical site. Results of the verification measurements for the first ten patients treated at this center reveal an average maximum dose per IMRT field delivered of 71.0 cGy, with a mean local deviation from the planned dose of – 1.2 cGy, and a standard deviation of 2.4 cGy.
