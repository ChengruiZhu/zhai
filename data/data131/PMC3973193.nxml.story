Phenothiazines are a family of heterocyclic compounds whose clinical utility includes treatment of psychiatric disorders as well as chemotherapy-induced emesis. Various studies have demonstrated that these compounds possess cytotoxic activities in tumor cell lines of different origin. However, there is considerable confusion regarding the molecular basis of phenothiazine-induced cell death. Lung cancer (LC) remains one of the most prevalent and deadly malignancies worldwide despite considerable efforts in the development of treatment strategies, especially new targeted therapies. In this work, we evaluated the potential utility of phenothiazines in human LC. We show that phenothiazines as single treatment decreased cell viability and induced cell death preferentially in small cell lung carcinoma (SCLC) over non small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC) cell lines. Sensitivity to phenothiazines was not correlated with induction of apoptosis but due to phenothiazine-induced lysosomal dysfunction. Interestingly, the higher susceptibility of SCLC cells to phenothiazine-induced cell death correlated with an intrinsically lower buffer capacity in response to disruption of lysosomal homeostasis. Importantly, this effect in SCLC occurred despite mutation in p53 and was not influenced by intrinsic sensitivity/resistance toward conventional chemotherapeutic agents. Our data thus uncovered a novel context-dependent activity of phenothiazines in SCLC and suggest that phenothiazines could be considered as a treatment regimen of this disease, however, extended cell line analyses as well as
