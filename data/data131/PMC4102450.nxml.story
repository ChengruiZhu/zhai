Spatial segregation of molecular contents is often necessary for an accurate, timely accomplishment of cellular functions, such as signal transduction and cell-fate decisions. For instance, budding yeast division requires the asymmetric segregation of proteins to distinguish a newborn cell from its parent. However, the strategies to achieve this parental identity are poorly understood. This holds especially true for key proteins and molecular complexes involved in mitosis that diffuse within the nuclear envelope. In fact, segregation within the nuclear envelope has been experimentally verified, but both the nature and configuration of any plausible diffusion barrier remain unknown. In this work, we built virtual models of the nucleus and carried out simulations testing the plausibility of specialised lipid domains and protein rings constituting the diffusion barrier. Moreover, we explored distinct barrier configurations in early and late stages of cell division, and verified our simulation results match experimental observations. Our work shows that the biophysical properties of these molecules, coordinated with morphological changes in the nucleus, make them suitable components of the nuclear diffusion barrier. Importantly, our research approach offers a novel avenue to study diffusion barriers in other biological membranes.
