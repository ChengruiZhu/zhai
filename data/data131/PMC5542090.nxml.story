Of the 1268 freshman entering the academy, 1177 consented to participate in this study. Males made up 82% of the cohort with an average age at enrollment of 19Â±1 years. Of those enrolled, 30 ACL injured cases with no history of injury at baseline met the inclusion criteria for this study. Ninety-two uninjured controls who also met the inclusion criteria completed follow-up assessments. There were no statistically significant pre-injury baseline differences between the ACL injured cases and uninjured controls on any of the PROMS except for the KOOS sports and recreation subscale, but this difference did not exceeded the MCID (Table 1). There were statistically significant differences across all KOOS and WOMAC subscales between ACL injured cases and uninjured controls at the time of the final follow-up assessment (Table 1). Four of the KOOS subscales (Pain, Symptoms, Sport, QOL) and the WOMAC stiffness subscale demonstrated greater than 8 point differences between groups, which exceeded the established MCID for these instruments (Figure 1A and 1B). There were no significant differences between ACL injured cases and uninjured controls on the MARS (p=0.635) at the time of the final follow-up. The ACL injured cases also reported significant deficits on the WOMAC stiffness (p=0.032) subscale, the MARS (p=0.030), and all KOOS subscales, with the exception of Function, at the time of final follow-up compared to their pre-injury baseline scores. These deficits exceeded the established MCID values for three of the KOOS subscales and the MARS.
