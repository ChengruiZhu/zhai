This study was to assess the Capri applicator for patients with endometrial cancer undergoing high‐radiation dose treatments following external‐beam radiation therapy. The Capri applicator is an inflatable vaginal cylinder with multiple channels. It is used to tailor the dose distribution to an asymmetric vaginal disease, and better spare organs at risk. Five patients with high‐risk endometrial cancer were selected for this study. The patients were treated with a high dose of radiation using the Capri applicator: daily fraction of 7 Gy was prescribed for a total dose of 21 Gy. The treatment plans included radiobiological parameters such as equivalent uniform dose (EUD), normal tissue complication probability (NTCP), and tumor control probability (TCP). Based on the dose‐volume histograms (DVH), we also calculated four quality factors: conformity index (CI), dose homogeneity index (DHI), dose nonuniformity index (DNR), and overdose index (OI). The TCP values range from 82.26% to 95.92%. Very low values of NTCP were observed for the bladder and rectum. The EUDs to organs at risk ranged from 4.65 Gy to 18.22 Gy for the bladder, and from 3.41 Gy from to 6.56 Gy for the rectum. The mean CI was
