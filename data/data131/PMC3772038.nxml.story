One hundred years ago, Alexander Graham Bell asked: “Can you measure the difference between one kind of smell and another? It is very obvious that we have very many different kinds of smells, all the way from the odor of violets and roses up to asafetida. But until you can measure their likenesses and differences you can have no science of odor.” Here we developed a computational framework and algorithm that looks at the molecular structure of two odors and predicts their ensuing perceptual similarity. Importantly, the algorithm works for odors that are each composed of a mixture containing tens of different molecules, much like natural smells. The algorithm that worked best was one that treats the odor-mixture as a single value, rather than a bunch of values reflecting each of its components. This is consistent with the growing view of how the mammalian brain treats odors: synthesizing a singular odor percept rather than analytically extracting individual odorant features from the odor-mixture. In conclusion, our algorithm's performance may contribute to the practice of the science of odor, and our algorithm's nature may contribute to the understanding of brain mechanisms of smell.
