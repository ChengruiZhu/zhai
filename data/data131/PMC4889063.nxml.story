Muscles consume metabolic energy to generate movement. Performing a movement over a long period of time or at a high intensity strains the respiratory and cardiovascular systems that need to replenish the energy reserves in muscle. Furthermore, consuming and replenishing metabolic energy involves biochemical reactions with byproducts that cause muscle fatigue. These biochemical reactions also produce heat that increases body temperature, potentially causing central fatigue. A model of muscle metabolic demand is therefore necessary for predicting and understanding the interaction of these factors that could limit performance, but currently no model exists for arbitrary physical tasks. In this study, we developed a model of metabolic demand by integrating a recently developed and validated model of muscle energetics into a musculoskeletal model. We showed that model predictions for leg exercise over a wide range of intensities were well within the experimental variability reported in the literature. To our knowledge, the muscle energetics model is the first to make valid predictions of metabolic demand at both the muscle and task level. The model is an important step toward understanding and planning around physical performance decrement, which is particularly useful for rehabilitation, competitive sports, and the military.
