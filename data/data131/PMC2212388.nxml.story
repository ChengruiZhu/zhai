The β2 family of integrins, CD11a, CD11b, CD11c, and αd, are expressed on most leukocytes. We show that the newest member of this family, αd, is expressed on human eosinophils in peripheral blood, and surface expression can be upregulated within minutes by phorbol ester or calcium ionophore A23187. Culture of eosinophils with interleukin 5 (IL-5) leads to a two- to fourfold increase in αd levels by 3–7 d without a change in α4 integrin expression. Eosinophils isolated from late phase bronchoalveolar lavage fluids express αd at levels similar to that seen after 3 d of IL-5 culture. Regarding αdβ2 ligands, in both freshly isolated and IL-5–cultured eosinophils, as well as αdβ2-transfected Chinese hamster ovary cells, αdβ2 can function as a ligand for vascular cell adhesion molecule 1 (VCAM-1). This conclusion is based on the ability of monoclonal antibodies to αd, β2, or VCAM-1 to block cell attachment in static adhesion assays. In experiments with eosinophils, the relative contribution of αdβ2 integrin– mediated adhesion is enhanced after IL-5 culture. These experiments demonstrate that αdβ2 is an alternative ligand for VCAM-1, and this integrin may play a role in eosinophil adhesion to VCAM-1 in states of chronic inflammation.
