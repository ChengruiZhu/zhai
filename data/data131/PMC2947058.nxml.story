The chloride ion channel cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) displays a typical adenosine trisphosphate (ATP)-binding cassette (ABC) protein architecture comprising two transmembrane domains, two intracellular nucleotide-binding domains (NBDs), and a unique intracellular regulatory domain. Once phosphorylated in the regulatory domain, CFTR channels can open and close when supplied with cytosolic ATP. Despite the general agreement that formation of a head-to-tail NBD dimer drives the opening of the chloride ion pore, little is known about how ATP binding to individual NBDs promotes subsequent formation of this stable dimer. Structural studies on isolated NBDs suggest that ATP binding induces an intra-domain conformational change termed “induced fit,” which is required for subsequent dimerization. We investigated the allosteric interaction between three residues within NBD2 of CFTR, F1296, N1303, and R1358, because statistical coupling analysis suggests coevolution of these positions, and because in crystal structures of ABC domains, interactions between these positions appear to be modulated by ATP binding. We expressed wild-type as well as F1296S, N1303Q, and R1358A mutant CFTR in
