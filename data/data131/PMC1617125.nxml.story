 Malaria kills over a million people a year worldwide, and young children in sub-Saharan are particularly at risk. Cheap, safe, and effective vaccines are needed. One strategy involves a double-vaccination process. This approach (termed “prime-boost”) uses two different delivery methods to transmit the same antigen (part of a protein from the malaria parasite that can trigger an immune response). The two-step vaccination is designed to achieve a greater immune response than with just one vaccination. One research group, based in Oxford in the UK, is using an antigen called “ME-TRAP,” which is delivered using first a strain of modified fowlpox virus (called FP9), then a weakened vaccinia virus (called MVA). Previous studies done in adult UK volunteers have been promising, achieving an immune response and some protection against malaria when volunteers were deliberately infected. However, this approach has not been tested in the group most in need of a vaccine—young African children. Therefore a field trial was conducted among 405 healthy children aged 1–6 years, in a region of Kenya with year-round malaria transmission. Children were randomized to receive either the sequence of vaccines delivering ME-TRAP or to receive a rabies vaccine (as control, but which still gives the children some benefit for taking part in the trial). The children were followed up for nine months, and the primary aim of the trial was to compare the occurrence of clinical malaria (fever combined with malaria parasites in the blood) in the two groups. The methods used in the trial were robust, using appropriate randomization procedures and blinding of participants and researchers. Outcome measures (clinical malaria, defined as fever together with parasites in the blood over 2,500/microliter) were clinically relevant. In order to detect cases of malaria in vaccinated children, health workers visited children weekly, and children with a temperature over 37.5 °C were tested for parasites in the blood. (In between the weekly visits, self-report and referral for assessment also allowed detection of cases.) This process of active detection of malaria cases (as opposed to obtaining data on clinical malaria only from self-report or referral) enables a smaller sample size to be used in the trial, but it is not clear whether this approach is more or less specific at picking up malaria cases than are passive methods. The researchers aimed to ensure that their case detection methods were specific; for children with normal temperature, but reported by their parents as feverish, parasite tests were done only if subsequent temperature readings were high.
