Continuous‐flow nanocatalysis based on metal nanoparticle catalyst‐anchored flow reactors has recently provided an excellent platform for effective chemical manufacturing. However, there has been limited progress in porous structure design and recycling systems for metal nanoparticle‐anchored flow reactors to create more efficient and sustainable catalytic processes. In this study, traditional paper is used for a highly efficient, recyclable, and even renewable flow reactor by tailoring the ultrastructures of wood pulp. The “paper reactor” offers hierarchically interconnected micro‐ and nanoscale pores, which can act as convective‐flow and rapid‐diffusion channels, respectively, for efficient access of reactants to metal nanoparticle catalysts. In continuous‐flow, aqueous, room‐temperature catalytic reduction of 4‐nitrophenol to 4‐aminophenol, a gold nanoparticle (AuNP)‐anchored paper reactor with hierarchical micro/nanopores provided higher reaction efficiency than state‐of‐the‐art AuNP‐anchored flow reactors. Inspired by traditional paper materials, successful recycling and renewal of AuNP‐anchored paper reactors were also demonstrated while high reaction efficiency was maintained.
