To understand and model cellular processes, we require accurate descriptions of the interactions occurring between constituent proteins. Large-scale protein interaction maps have typically been measured in two distinct ways. The first detects direct pair-wise associations by testing only two proteins at a time for an interaction. The second detects large groups of proteins that have conglomerated or purified together. With regard to the latter, it is difficult to deduce which pairs of proteins are physically interacting in the purification data, and interaction maps generally appear random and unstructured. We have developed a novel computational method to analyze the purification data (from the second method) and identify which proteins are directly interacting. The resultant protein interaction map is highly modular, meaning that the proteins organize themselves into localized, densely connected regions that likely represent individually functioning units. We also analyzed interaction maps of the first method and propose that their lack of modularity is a consequence of missing interactions that are undetected for unclear reasons. This study provides insights into the differences between the two interaction detection methods as well as the nature of biological organization.
