Protein kinase C epsilon (PKCε), a novel calcium-independent PKC isoform, has been shown to be a transforming oncogene. PKCε-mediated oncogenic activity is linked to its ability to promote cell survival. However, the mechanisms by which PKCε signals cell survival remain elusive. We found that signal transducers and activators of transcription 3 (Stat3), which is constitutively activated in a wide variety of human cancers, is a protein partner of PKCε. Stat3 has two conserved amino acid (Tyr705 and Ser727) residues, which are phosphorylated during Stat3 activation. PKCε interacts with Stat3α isoform which has Ser727 and not with Stat3β isoform which lacks Ser727. PKCε-Stat3 interaction and Stat3Ser727 phosphorylation was initially observed during induction of squamous cell carcinomas and in prostate cancer. Now we present that: 1) PKCε physically interacts with Stat3α isoform in various human cancer cells: skin melanomas (MeWo and WM266-4), gliomas (T98G and MO59K), bladder (RT-4 and UM-UC-3), colon (Caco-2), lung (H1650), pancreatic (PANC-1), and breast (MCF-7 and MDA:MB-231). 2) Inhibition of PKCε expression using specific siRNA inhibits Stat3Ser727 phosphorylation, Stat3-DNA binding, Stat3-regulated gene expression as well as cell invasion. 3) PKCε mediates Stat3Ser727 phosphorylation via integration with the MAPK cascade (RAF-1, MEK1/2, and ERK1/2). The results indicate that PKCε-mediated Stat3Ser727 phosphorylation is essential for constitutive activation of Stat3 and cell invasion in various human cancers.
