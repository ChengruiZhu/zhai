Understanding how behavior is connected to cellular and network processes is one of the most important challenges in neuroscience, and computational modeling allows one to directly formulate hypotheses regarding the interactions between these scales. We present a model of the hippocampal network, an area of the brain important for spatial navigation and episodic memory, memory of “what, when, and where.” We show how the model, which consists of neurons and connections based on biophysical properties known from experiments, can guide a virtual rat through the spatial alternation task by storing a memory of the previous path through an environment. Our model shows how neurons that fire selectively based on both the current location and past trajectory of the animal (dubbed “splitter cells”) might emerge from a newly discovered biophysical interaction in these cells. Our model is not intended to be comprehensive, but rather to contain just enough detail to achieve performance of the behavioral task. Goals of this approach are to present a scenario by which the gap between biophysics and behavior can be bridged and to provide a framework for the formulation of experimentally testable hypotheses.
