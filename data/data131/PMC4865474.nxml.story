 hybridization to decipher spatiotemporal gathering of multiple DEREs in the nucleus. Upon estrogen stimulation, scattered 20q13 DEREs were mobilized to form regulatory depots for synchronized gene expression of target loci. A chromosome conformation capture assay coupled with chromatin immunoprecipitation further uncovered that ERÎ±-bound regulatory depots are tethered to heterochromatin protein 1 (HP1) for coordinated chromatin movement and histone modifications of target loci, resulting in transcription repression. Neutralizing HP1 function dysregulated the formation of DERE-involved regulatory depots and transcription inactivation of candidate tumor-suppressor genes. Deletion of amplified DEREs using the CRISPR/Cas9 genomic-editing system profoundly altered transcriptional profiles of proliferation-associated signaling networks, resulting in reduction of cancer cell growth. These findings reveal a formerly uncharacterized feature wherein multiple copies of the amplicon congregate as transcriptional units in the nucleus for synchronous regulation of function-related loci in tumorigenesis. Disruption of their assembly can be a new strategy for treating breast cancers and other malignancies.
