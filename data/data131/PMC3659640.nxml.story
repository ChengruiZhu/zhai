, has a variety of physiologic and pharmacologic effects. The purpose of this study was to explore the effects of ginsenoside Rd (G-Rd) on melastatin type transient receptor potential 7 (TRPM7) channels with respect to the proliferation and survival of AGS and MCF-7 cells (a gastric and a breast cancer cell line, respectively). AGS and MCF-7 cells were treated with different concentrations of G-Rd, and caspase-3 activities, mitochondrial depolarizations, and sub-G1 fractions were analyzed to determine if cell death occurred by apoptosis. In addition, human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293 cells overexpressing TRPM7 channels were used to confirm the role of TRPM7 channels. G-Rd inhibited the proliferation and survival of AGS and MCF-7 cells and enhanced caspase-3 activity, mitochondrial depolarization, and sub-G1 populations. In addition, G-Rd inhibited TRPM7-like currents in AGS and MCF-7 cells and in TRPM7 channel overexpressing HEK 293 cells, as determined by whole cell voltage-clamp recordings. Furthermore, TRPM7 overexpression in HEK 293 cells promoted G-Rd induced cell death. These findings suggest that G-Rd inhibits the proliferation and survival of gastric and breast cancer cells by inhibiting TRPM7 channel activity.
