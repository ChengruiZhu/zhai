B transcription factor. Detachment of mammary epithelial cells potently increases mitochondrial superoxide levels, which are further elevated by depletion of MnSOD in suspended cells. Consequently, cells depleted of MnSOD are hypersensitive to matrix detachment and exhibit increased anoikis. These results suggest that detachment-induced MnSOD counters mitochondrial superoxide accumulation and confers anoikis resistance. Taken together with our previous finding that detached cells evade excessive ROS production by attenuating oxidative metabolism of glucose, we conclude that mammary epithelial cells coordinate their responses to detachment through increasing MnSOD and decreasing ROS generation from mitochondrial glucose oxidation, thereby mitigating anoikis. Anoikis is a barrier to tumor metastasis. Indeed, MnSOD expression is elevated in human breast cancer metastases compared with primary tumors. Expression of MnSOD correlates with histologic tumor grades in human cancer and contributes to cancer cell's resistance to anoikis. Our study suggests that inhibition of ROS detoxification coupled with stimulation of glucose oxidative metabolism may be an efficient strategy to enhance anoikis and block metastasis.
