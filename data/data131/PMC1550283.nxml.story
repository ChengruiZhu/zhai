Obesity is a major pub lic health concern in many developed countries. While some people appear to stay lean no matter what or how much they eat, others appear to be genetically predisposed to obesity. The genetic similarity between mouse and human makes the mouse a promising mammalian model system to study obesity. Advantages of mouse models include the ability to control diet/environment and easy access to relevant tissues for gene expression studies. Mouse cross studies have implicated dozens of chromosomal regions that contain weight-predisposing genes, and gene expression studies have yielded hundreds of body weight–related genes. In this study, the authors use a gene network–based approach for integrating clinical traits, genetic marker data, and gene expression data. Instead of focusing on individual genes, the authors provide a systems-level view of a module of genes related to body weight. The resulting model allows them to characterize weight-related genes utilizing network concepts (intramodular connectivity) and genetic concepts (module quantitative trait locus). This integrative genomics approach provides new insights into the relationship between gene expression and body weight.
