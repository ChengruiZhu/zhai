In the current study, we planned to predict the optimal gene functions for osteosarcoma (OS) by integrating network-based method with guilt by association (GBA) principle (called as network-based gene function inference approach) based on gene ontology (GO) data and gene expression profile. To begin with, differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were extracted using linear models for microarray data (LIMMA) package. Then, construction of differential co-expression network (DCN) relying on DEGs was implemented, and sub-DCN was identified using Spearman correlation coefficient (SCC). Subsequently, GO annotations for OS were collected according to known confirmed database and DEGs. Ultimately, gene functions were predicted by means of GBA principle based on the area under the curve (AUC) for GO terms, and we determined GO terms with AUC >0.7 as the optimal gene functions for OS. Totally, 123 DEGs and 137 GO terms were obtained for further analysis. A DCN was constructed, which included 123 DEGs and 7503 interactions. A total of 105 GO terms were identified when the threshold was set as AUC >0.5, which had a good classification performance. Among these 105 GO terms, 2 functions had the AUC >0.7 and were determined as the optimal gene functions including angiogenesis (AUC =0.767) and regulation of immune system process (AUC =0.710). These gene functions appear to have potential for early detection and clinical treatment of OS in the future.
