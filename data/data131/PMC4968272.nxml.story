A total of 843 patients met the inclusion criteria and were successfully enrolled. 482 (57%) were males, with a median cohort age of 27 years. Baseline characteristics of the cohort are summarized in Table 1. At 2 years, follow-up was obtained on 82% (694/843). There were two rehabilitation-related factors which were found to be influential of 2 year outcomes. Patients who were prescribed an ACL brace for return to sport had significantly better KOOS sports/rec scores at 2 years (odds ratio=1.50; 95% CI=1.07-2.11; p=0.019). Patients who were prescribed an ACL derotation brace to be used in post-op rehab were 2.26 times more likely to have a subsequent surgery by 2 years (OR = 2.26; 95% CI=1.11-4.60; p=0.024). Lower baseline outcome scores, activity level, and female gender all significantly increased the odds of reporting poorer clinical outcomes (IKDC, all KOOS subscales, and Marx activity rating score) at 2 years. Alternatively, whether or not a physician restricted a patientâ€™s passive or active ROM post-operatively, restricted full weight-bearing without support, or prescribed a motion control brace post-op, were all found not to be influential risk factors for 2 year outcomes in this revision cohort.
