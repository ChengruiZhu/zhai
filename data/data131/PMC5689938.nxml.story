) for each patient. For comparison, we used a graphical‐based method to generate semiautomated segmented volumes (GBSV). To address any perturbations in radiomic feature values, we down‐sampled the tumor volumes into three gray‐levels: 32, 64, and 128 from the original gray‐level of 256. Finally, we analyzed the effect on radiomic features on PET images of eight patients due to four PET 3D‐reconstruction algorithms: maximum likelihood‐ordered subset expectation maximization (OSEM) iterative reconstruction (IR) method, fourier rebinning‐ML‐OSEM (FOREIR), FORE‐filtered back projection (FOREFBP), and 3D‐Reprojection (3DRP) analytical method. We extracted 79 features from all segmentation method, gray‐levels of down‐sampled volumes, and PET reconstruction algorithms. The features were extracted using gray‐level co‐occurrence matrices (GLCM), gray‐level size zone matrices (GLSZM), gray‐level run‐length matrices (GLRLM), neighborhood gray‐tone difference matrices (NGTDM), shape‐based features (SF), and intensity histogram features (IHF). We computed the Dice coefficient between each MTV and GBSV to measure segmentation accuracy. Coefficient values close to one indicate high agreement, and values close to zero indicate low agreement. We evaluated the effect on radiomic features by calculating the mean percentage differences (
