), we present a new multirate algorithm that allows us to handle each component of a large system with a step size appropriate to its time scale. We take care of error estimates in a recursive manner allowing individual components to follow their discretization time course while keeping numerical error within acceptable bounds. The method is developed with an ultimate goal of minimizing the communication between the components. Thus it is especially suitable for co-simulations. Our preliminary results support our confidence that the multirate approach can be used in the class of problems we are interested in. We show that the dynamics ofa communication signal as well as an appropriate choice of the discretization order between system components may have a significant impact on the accuracy of the coupled simulation. Although, the ideas presented in the paper have only been tested on a single model, it is likely that they can be applied to other problems without loss of generality. We believe that this work may significantly contribute to the establishment of a firm theoretical basis and to the development of an efficient computational framework for multiscale modeling and simulations.
