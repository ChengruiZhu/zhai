The program of cellular senescence is involved in both the G1 and G2 phase of the cell cycle, limiting G1/S and G2/M progression respectively, and resulting in prolonged cell cycle arrest. Cellular senescence is involved in normal wound healing. However, multiple organs display increased senescent cell numbers both during natural aging and after injury, suggesting that senescent cells can have beneficial as well as detrimental effects in organismal aging and disease. Also in the kidney, senescent cells accumulate in various compartments with advancing age and renal disease. In experimental studies, forced apoptosis induction through the clearance of senescent cells leads to better preservation of kidney function during aging. Recent groundbreaking studies demonstrate that senescent cell depletion through INK-ATTAC transgene-mediated or cell-penetrating FOXO4-DRI peptide induced forced apoptosis, reduced age-associated damage and dysfunction in multiple organs, in particular the kidney, and increased performance and lifespan. Senescence is also involved in oncology and therapeutic depletion of senescent cells by senolytic drugs has been studied in experimental and human cancers. Although studies with senolytic drugs in models of kidney injury are lacking, their dose limiting side effects on other organs suggest that targeted delivery might be needed for successful application of senolytic drugs for treatment of kidney disease. In this review, we discuss (i) current understanding of the mechanisms and associated pathways of senescence, (ii) evidence of senescence occurrence and causality with organ injury, and (iii) therapeutic strategies for senescence depletion (senotherapy) including targeting, all in the context of renal aging and disease.
