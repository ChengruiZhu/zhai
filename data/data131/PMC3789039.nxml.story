The aim of the present study was to investigate whether the measurement of cytokines from abdominal exudate is valuable for the early diagnosis of prolonged postoperative ileus (PPOI) following colorectal surgery. In the present study, 100 consecutive patients who were scheduled to undergo elective resection for carcinoma of the sigmoid or rectum were investigated. Abdominal exudate was obtained via a drain tube following surgery for the detection of interleukin (IL)-1β, IL-6 and tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-α. The correlation among the cytokine levels on postoperative days 1, 3 and 5 and the development of PPOI was investigated. Eight patients developed PPOI which was diagnosed 10–15 days postoperatively. No significant differences were observed among the peritoneal cytokine levels on postoperative days 1 and 3 in the 8 patients who developed PPOI when compared with those of the 92 patients that did not develop PPOI. By contrast, cytokine levels on postoperative day 5 were significantly higher in patients who developed PPOI when compared with those of patients that did not develop PPOI. The cytokine levels significantly increased during the first 5 days postoperatively in patients who developed PPOI and significantly decreased in patients who did not develop PPOI. The results of the present study showed that the increase in peritoneal IL-1β, IL-6 and TNF-α levels may be an additional early diagnostic predictor of PPOI following colorectal surgery.
