Anti-microtubule drugs, such as paclitaxel (PTX), are extensively used for the treatment of numerous cancers. However, growing evidence has shown that PTX resistance, either intrinsic or acquired, frequently occurs in patients and results in the failure of treatment, contributing to the high cancer mortality rate. Therefore, it is necessary to identify the genes or pathways involved in anti-microtubule drug resistance for future successful treatment of cancers. Pygopus2 (Pygo2), which contains a Zn-coordinated plant homeodomain (PHD) finger domain, is critical for Î²-catenin-dependent transcriptional switches in normal and malignant tissues and is over-expressed in various cancers, including human brain glioma. In this study, we report that over-expression of Pygo2 inhibited the efficacy of PTX and contributed to cell multidrug resistance in two different ways. First, over-expression of Pygo2 inhibited the PTX-induced phosphorylation of B-cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2), suppressing the proteolytic cleavage of procaspase-8/9 and further inhibiting the activation of caspase-3, which also inhibits the activation of the JNK/SAPK pathway, ultimately inhibiting cell apoptosis. Second, over-expression of Pygo2 facilitated the expression of P-glycoprotein, which acts as a drug efflux pump, by promoting the transcription of Multi-drug resistance 1 (MDR1) at the MDR1 promoter loci, resulting in acceleration of the efflux of PTX.
