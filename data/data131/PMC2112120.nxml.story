By use of dark-field light microscopy, secretory granules isolated from the anglerfish endocrine pancreas were observed to attach to and release from microtubules assembled in vitro from brain homogenates. Secretory granules only bound to microtubules assembled in the presence of microtubule-associated proteins (MAPs) and not to microtubules assembled from purified tubulin. The addition of a MAP fraction to purified tubulin restored secretory granule binding. The secretory granules were released from MAP-containing microtubules by the addition of Mg-ATP but not by other nucleotides. The number of secretory granules bound to MAP-containing microtubules was increased in the presence of cyclic AMP. In addition to the associations of secretory granules with microtubules, MAP-containing microtubules also associated with each other. These laterally associated microtubules were dispersed by the addition of Mg-ATP. Electron micrographs confirmed that the associations between MAP-containing microtubules and secretory granules as well as the associations of microtubules with one another were mediated by the high molecular weight MAPs known to project from the surface of in-vitro-assembled microtubules.
