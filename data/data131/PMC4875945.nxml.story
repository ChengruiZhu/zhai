Bretschneider (histidine-tryptophan-ketoglutarate, HTK) solution employed for induction of cardioplegic arrest possesses a high histidine concentration (198 mM). Due to the large volume administered, massive amounts of histidine are incorporated. The aim of the study was to evaluate alterations in amino acid and nitrogen metabolism originating from histidine degradation. Between 07/2014 and 10/2014, a total of 29 consecutive patients scheduled for elective isolated coronary artery bypass grafting with cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) were enrolled in this prospective observational study. The patients received 1.6 L cardioplegic Bretschneider solution on average. Blood gas and urine samples obtained were analyzed for amino acid as well as urea and ammonium concentrations. After CPB initiation, plasma histidine concentration greatly increased to 21,000 µM to reach 8000 µM at the end. Within the operative period, plasma concentrations of aspartate, glutamate, asparagine, alanine, and glutamine increased variable in magnitude. During the same time, urinary analysis revealed histidine excretion of 19,500 µmol in total and marked elevations in glutamate and glutamine excretion. The absolute amounts of urea and ammonium excreted additionally were 3 mmol and 8 mmol, respectively. Already during CPB, distinct amounts of the histidine administered are metabolized, mainly to other amino acids, but only small amounts to urea and ammonia. Thus, the impact of the histidine incorporated on acid–base status in the intraoperative phase is minor. On the other hand, intraoperative provision of several amino acids arising from histidine metabolism might mitigate postaggression syndrome.
