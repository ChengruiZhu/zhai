A total of 467 patients with sPHPT, 52 with MEN1- and 16 with MEN2A-related PHPT were analyzed. Patients with sPHPT were older, more often female and had higher preoperative calcium and parathyroid hormone levels, when compared with MEN1 and MEN2A patients. Minimally invasive parathyroidectomy (MIP) was performed in 367 of 467 sPHPT patients (79%). One abnormal parathyroid was found in 426 patients (91%). Two or more in 35 patients (7%). In six patients (1%) no abnormal parathyroid gland was retrieved. Of 52 MEN1 patients, eight (15%) underwent a MIP and 44 patients (85%) underwent conventional neck exploration (CNE); with resection of fewer than 3½ enlarged glands in 21 patients (40%), subtotal parathyroidectomy (SPTX, 3-3½ glands) in seventeen (33%) and total parathyroidectomy with autotransplantation (TPTX) in six (12%). Eleven patients (21%) had persistent disease, 29 (56%) recurrent PHPT and nine (17%) permanent hypoparathyroidism, mostly after TPTX. Of 16 MEN2A patients, six (38%) underwent MIP, four (25%) CNE and six (38%) selective resection of the enlarged gland(s) during total thyroidectomy. Three patients (19%) suffered from persistent PHPT and two (13%) developed recurrent disease.
