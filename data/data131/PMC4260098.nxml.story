Patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) have an increased risk of developing colorectal cancer (CRC). Accordingly, the duration and anatomic extent of the disease have been known to affect the development of IBD-related CRC. When CRC occurs in patients with IBD, unlike in sporadic CRC, it is difficult to detect the lesions because of mucosal changes caused by inflammation. In addition, the tumor types vary with ill-circumscribed lesions, and the cancer is difficult to diagnose and remedy at an early stage. For the diagnosis of CRC in patients with IBD, screening endoscopy is recommended 8 to 10 years after the IBD diagnosis, and surveillance colonoscopy is recommended every 1 to 2 years thereafter. The recent development of targeted biopsies using chromoendoscopy and relatively newer endoscopic techniques helps in the early diagnosis of CRC in patients with IBD. A total proctocolectomy is advisable when high-grade dysplasia or multifocal low-grade dysplasia is confirmed by screening endoscopy or surveillance colonoscopy or if a nonadenoma-like dysplasia-associated lesion or mass is detected. Currently, pharmacotherapies are being extensively studied as a way to prevent IBD-related CRC.
