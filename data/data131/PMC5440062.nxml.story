Human motor adaptation of limb movement in response to force perturbations has been shown to be motion-state dependent. That is, the compensatory response to these disturbances is correlated and proportional to the temporal changes in the position, velocity, and acceleration during the motion. Despite a growing understanding of this adaptation process, there is little information on the relative stability of this learning when based on these different temporal features of movement. Here we modified a previous computational model of motor adaptation to predict the decay of the compensatory response associated to different motion states, specifically learning based on temporal variations in limb position and velocity. We confirmed the simulated behavior by examining the decay of the temporal force output after subjects were trained to compensate for movement disturbances based on different combinations and magnitudes of these two motion states. Both simulation and behavioral results show that velocity-based learning decays at a slower rate than position-based, even when learning is significantly biased towards the latter at the end of training. Collectively, these results suggest that motion-state learning based on movement velocity is more stable than that based on limb position.
