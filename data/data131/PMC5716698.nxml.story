Hepatoblastomas are uncommon embryonal liver tumors accounting for approximately 80% of childhood hepatic cancer. We hypothesized that epigenetic changes, including DNA methylation, could be relevant to hepatoblastoma onset. The methylomes of eight matched hepatoblastomas and non-tumoral liver tissues were characterized, and data were validated in an independent group (11 hepatoblastomas). In comparison to differentiated livers, hepatoblastomas exhibited a widespread and non-stochastic pattern of global low-level hypomethylation. The analysis revealed 1,359 differentially methylated CpG sites (DMSs) between hepatoblastomas and control livers, which are associated with 765 genes. Hypomethylation was detected in hepatoblastomas for ~58% of the DMSs with enrichment at intergenic sites, and most of the hypermethylated CpGs were located in CpG islands. Functional analyses revealed enrichment in signaling pathways involved in metabolism, negative regulation of cell differentiation, liver development, cancer, and Wnt signaling pathway. Strikingly, an important overlap was observed between the 1,359 DMSs and the CpG sites reported to exhibit methylation changes through liver development (p<0.0001), with similar patterns of methylation in both hepatoblastomas and fetal livers compared to adult livers. Overall, our results suggest an arrest at early stages of liver cell differentiation, in line with the hypothesis that hepatoblastoma ontogeny involves the disruption of liver development. This genome-wide methylation dysfunction, taken together with a relatively small number of driver genetic mutations reported for both adult and pediatric liver cancers, shed light on the relevance of epigenetic mechanisms for hepatic tumorigenesis.
