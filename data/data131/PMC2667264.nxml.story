Metabolism of multicellular organisms has to adjust to environmental changes. Insulin signaling plays an important role in this regulation. Stress signals can repress Insulin signaling, curtailing growth to promote stress tolerance and extend lifespan. While this interaction allows managing energy resources under stress conditions, excessive JNK activity in adipose tissue of vertebrates has been found to promote type II diabetes. Thus, the interaction between stress and Insulin signaling has to be carefully regulated to ensure proper metabolic adaptation. Here, we identify a new regulatory mechanism by which stress signaling influences metabolism in fruitflies. We show that an evolutionarily conserved secreted protein, Neural Lazarillo (NLaz), is induced in response to stress signals, and that it is required for metabolic regulation. NLaz mutant animals are more sensitive to stress and show significant metabolic deficiencies. Similarly, increased expression of NLaz inhibits growth, but increases stress and starvation tolerance. We show that these functions are mediated by an interaction with the Insulin signaling pathway. Our results show that the regulation of NLaz by stress signals is critical for metabolic adaptation of the organism to environmental challenges. Both the Insulin and JNK signaling mechanisms analyzed here are evolutionarily conserved, suggesting that similar interactions control metabolic adaptation in vertebrates.
