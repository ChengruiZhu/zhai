Demographics age = 65.3 ± 8.5 years, male = 78%, left atrial size = 4.66 ± 0.64 cm, redo ablation 20/23(87%). AAF were left atrial in 30 (97%). For each AAF, 1273 ± 697 points were used for UHD-ASM. Time to create and interpret the UHD-ASM was 20 ± 11 min. For every AAF, the entire circuit was identified. Thirty (97%) were macroreentry. AAF cycle length was 267 ± 49 ms, and the circuit length was 138 ± 38 mm (range 35–187). Macroreentry atrial flutters took varied pathways, but each had an area of slow conduction (ASC) averaging 16 ± 6 mm (range 6–29) in length. Entrainment was not utilized. We targeted the ASC and ablation terminated AAF directly in 19/31 (61.3%) and altered AAF activation in 7/31 (22.6%), all of which terminated directly with additional mapping/ablation. AAF degenerated to atrial fibrillation in 2/31 (6.5%) with RF and could not be reinduced after ASC ablation. Median time from initial ablation to AAF termination was 64 s. Thus, 28/31 (90.3%) terminated with RF energy and/or could not be reinduced after ASC ablation. At 1 year of follow-up, 77% were free of atrial tachycardia or atrial flutter and 61% were free of all atrial arrhythmias.
