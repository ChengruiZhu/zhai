More than 5,000 species of mammals share a basic larynx design. Many of them use the larynx to produce an enormous variability of sounds, but only in a handful of species has the physiology of sound production been studied. It is impracticable in most species because observation requires invasive techniques. Furthermore, many mammals do not spontaneously vocalize if they are manipulated or handled. We have constructed a finite element model of vocal fold tissue vibration on the basis of morphological and biomechanical features of the Rocky Mountain elk vocal organs. Operating within reasonable physiological parameter ranges, it allows the investigation of sound production efficiency as well as selective forces. The model can produce sounds with fundamental frequencies ranging between 60 and 1,200 Hz, covering not only some of the natural vocal repertoire of the elk's high-pitched bugle calls but also those of its close relative, the European Red Deer, who produces low-pitched roaring sounds with a similar anatomy. The approach is of broader interest, first because techniques can be adapted to other mammal species using only landmark anatomical and biomechanical features, and second, because simulations can serve as playbacks for perception studies investigating the role of vocalizations in communication.
