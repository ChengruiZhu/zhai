Although patients with functional dyspepsia complain of epigastric symptoms, the relation between these symptoms and gastric motility remains controversial. There are few reports on the clinical course of functional dyspepsia, including changes in gastric motility, observed over a considerably long period. We conducted a study to examine association between changes in symptoms and changes in ultrasonographically evaluated gastric motility over a long-term follow-up period in patients with functional dyspepsia. Forty patients (18 men, 22 women; mean age, 53.7 years) with functional dyspepsia were followed up by medical interview, physical examination, endoscopy, and ultrasonography for gastric motility. Follow-up ranged from 1.0 to 7.8 years (mean, 3.0 years). Ultrasonographic evaluation of gastric motility included gastric emptying rate and antral contractions. During the follow-up period, patients were treated with proton pump inhibitors, H2-blockers, or prokinetics. Symptoms improved in 21 patients (group A), but symptoms persisted or worsened in 19 patients (group B). There were no significant differences in clinical characteristics between the two groups. Gastric motility improved in group A but not in group B. In conclusion, improved gastric motility appears to correspond to and may explain improved symptoms in some patients with functional dyspepsia.
