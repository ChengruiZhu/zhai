The metabolic features of tumor cells diverge from those of normal cells. Otto Warburg was the first to observe that cancer cells dramatically increase their glucose consumption to generate ATP. He also claimed that cancer cells do not have functional mitochondria or oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) but simply rely on glycolysis to provide ATP to the cell, even in the presence of oxygen (aerobic glycolysis). Several studies have revisited this observation and demonstrated that most cancer cells contain metabolically efficient mitochondria. Indeed, to sustain high proliferation rates, cancer cells require functional mitochondria to provide ATP and intermediate metabolites, such as citrate and cofactors, for anabolic reactions. This difference in metabolism between normal and tumors cells causes the latter to be more sensitive to agents that can disrupt energy homeostasis. In this review, we focus on energy disruptors, such as biguanides, 2-deoxyglucose and 5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide ribonucleotide, that interfere with the main metabolic pathways of the cells, OXPHOS, glycolysis and glutamine metabolism. We discuss the preclinical data and the mechanisms of action of these disruptors at the cellular and molecular levels. Finally, we consider whether these drugs can reasonably contribute to the antitumoral therapeutic arsenal in the future.
