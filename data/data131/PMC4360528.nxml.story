Aneurysms within renal angiomyolipomas (AML) may rupture into the tumor or pararenal space. Transcatheter arterial embolization is the first-choice treatment to control bleeding. Here, we describe the use of coil embolization in two cases of spontaneous intratumoral hemorrhage with the hemodynamic characteristics of renal arteriovenous (AV) fistula in renal AML. In case 1, renal angiography showed several intratumoral aneurysms, one of which had ruptured into the tumor, resulting in the formation of an intratumoral hematoma. Blood flow within the hematoma was rapid and the blood was immediately returned to the systemic circulation through the left renal vein. In case 2, renal angiography showed that the rupture of an intratumoral aneurysm of a tumor-feeding artery had resulted in formation of an intratumoral hematoma and direct renal vein communication. No extratumoral hemorrhage was observed in either case. The hemodynamics of both hematomas resembled those of a high-flow renal AV fistula. The ruptured aneurysms were embolized with detachable and pushable coils (case 1) or pushable coils only (case 2). To our knowledge, this is the first report of successful embolization of AV fistula-like intratumoral hemorrhage in renal AML.
