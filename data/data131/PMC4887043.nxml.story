-methylglucamide complex (SbL8), are promising drug candidates. It has been previously reported that SbL8 forms kinetically stabilized nanoassemblies in water and that this simple dispersion exhibits antileishmanial activity when given by oral route to a murine model of visceral leishmaniasis. The main objective of the present work was to interfere in the structural organization of these nanoassemblies so as to investigate their influence on the oral bioavailability of Sb, and ultimately, optimize an oral formulation of SbL8 for the treatment of cutaneous leishmaniasis. The structural organization of SbL8 nanoassemblies was manipulated through addition of propylene glycol (PG) to the aqueous dispersion of SbL8. The presence of 50% (v/v) PG resulted in the loss of hydrophobic microenvironment, as evidenced by fluorescence probing. However, nanostructures were still present, as demonstrated by dynamic light scattering, small-angle X-ray scattering, and atomic force microscopy (AFM). A remarkable property of these nanoassemblies, as revealed by AFM analysis, is the flexibility of their supramolecular organization, which showed changes as a function of the solvent and substrate polarities. The formulation of SbL8 in 1:1 water:PG given orally to mice promoted significantly higher and more sustained serum levels of Sb, when compared to SbL8 in water. The new formulation, when given as repeated doses (200 mg Sb/kg/day) to BALB/c mice infected with
