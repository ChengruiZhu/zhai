The speed of sequencing of microbial genomes and metagenomes is providing an ever increasing resource for the identification of new robust biocatalysts with industrial applications for many different aspects of industrial biotechnology. Using ‘natures catalysts’ provides a sustainable approach to chemical synthesis of fine chemicals, general chemicals such as surfactants and new consumer-based materials such as biodegradable plastics. This provides a sustainable and ‘green chemistry’ route to chemical synthesis which generates no toxic waste and is environmentally friendly. In addition, enzymes can play important roles in other applications such as carbon dioxide capture, breakdown of food and other waste streams to provide a route to the concept of a ‘circular economy’ where nothing is wasted. The use of improved bioinformatic approaches and the development of new rapid enzyme activity screening methodology can provide an endless resource for new robust industrial biocatalysts.This mini-review will discuss several recent case studies where industrial enzymes of ‘high priority’ have been identified and characterised. It will highlight specific hydrolase enzymes and recent case studies which have been carried out within our group in Exeter.
