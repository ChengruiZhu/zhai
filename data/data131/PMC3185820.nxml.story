Haemangiopericytoma is a rare soft tissue tumour, with great histological variability and unpredictable clinical and biological behaviour. The precise cell type origin is uncertain. One third of haemangiopericytomas occur in the head and neck area, but only a few cases have been reported regarding localization at the parapharyngeal space. Herewith, case is presented of a 54-year-old female, referred to our Department due to a parapharyngeal space tumour with non-specific imaging characteristics. The patient underwent radical excision of the tumour with a trans-cervical sub-mandibular approach. The histolopathologic examination revealed a neoplasm with the characteristic features of haemangiopericytoma. One year later, during the scheduled follow-up, the computerized tomography scan showed no evidence of recurrence or residual disease. The pre-operative evaluation of a haemangiopericytoma must include a thorough imaging evaluation with computerized tomography and magnetic resonance imaging, even if results may not be specific for haemangiopericytoma. Angiography and pre-operative embolization may be performed in cases of large tumours with significant vascularity. The treatment of choice is radical excision. The follow-up includes clinical evaluation every 6 months and annual magnetic resonance imaging for at least 3 years.
