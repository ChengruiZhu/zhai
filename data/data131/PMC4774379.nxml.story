Scientific training, elimination of fatigue, and reasonable nutrition is the three important parts of successful training. Especially in the fatigue recovery and reasonable nutrition of track and field endurance project, which is more important than other project significance? This paper is to more scientific nutritional intervention on the walking athletes to improve athletic performance and provide experimental evidence 12 male and 12 female athletes were selected from the Chinese national walking team were given the nutrition intervention of a variety of sports supplements for 9 weeks. The serum testosterone (T), blood urea (BU), and serum creative phosphokinase (CK) and other indicators were tested in several weekends. The results showed that the different exercise taking supplements can increase the T levels of male and female walking athletes, and promote the body protein synthesis and the function of rapid recovery, reduce the levels of serum CK and BU abnormalities after the intensity training, and ensure the smooth completion of the training and a normal competitive level. The different exercise taking supplements can improve the biochemical indicators and improve the level of physical function.
