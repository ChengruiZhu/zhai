The interactions between proteins play a crucial role for almost every undertaking of a cell. Many of these interactions are mediated by the binding of relatively short unstructured polypeptide segments, or peptides, in one protein to well-folded domains in other proteins. Such protein-peptide interactions have some interesting and special properties, e.g., promiscuity, which means many different peptide sequences are able to bind the same protein domain. Peptides also often exhibit structural flexibility even after binding a protein. These special properties make it desirable, but also challenging, to simulate protein-peptide binding in atomistic detail for many different peptide sequences. To this end, we have developed a computational algorithm that simultaneously explores the structure of protein-peptide complexes and the amino acid sequences of the peptide. In particular, our algorithm allows binding-competent peptide sequences to be generated in direct relation to their binding strengths. We also explored the possibility of using our method to locate new peptide-binding pockets on protein structures. Computational algorithms such as the one developed here may pave the way to reveal the full complexity of protein-protein interaction networks used in cells.
