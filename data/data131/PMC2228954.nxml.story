Models for the gating of ion channels usually assume that the rate constants for leaving any given kinetic state are independent of previous channel activity. Although such discrete Markov models have been successful in describing channel gating, there is little direct evidence for the Markov assumption of time-invariant rate constants for constant conditions. This paper tests the Markov assumption by determining whether the single-channel kinetics of the large conductance Ca-activated K channel in cultured rat skeletal muscle are independent of previous single-channel activity. The experimental approach is to examine dwell-time distributions conditional on adjacent interval durations. The time constants of the exponential components describing the distributions are found to be independent of adjacent interval duration, and hence, previous channel activity. In contrast, the areas of the different components can change. Since the observed time constants are a function of the underlying rate constants for transitions among the kinetic states, the observation of time constants independent of previous channel activity suggests that the rate constants are also independent of previous channel activity. Thus, the channel kinetics are consistent with Markov gating. An observed dependent (inverse) relationship between durations of adjacent open and shut intervals together with Markov gating indicates that there are two or more independent transition pathways connecting open and shut states. Finally, no evidence is found to suggest that gating is not at thermodynamic equilibrium: the inverse relationship was independent of the time direction of analysis.
