For a long time, it was believed that the control of processes in living organisms is almost only performed by proteins. Only recently, scientists learned that a further class of molecules, namely special RNAs, plays an important role in cell control. In consequence, research on such RNAs enjoys increasing attention over the last few years. These RNAs were called noncoding RNAs (ncRNA), because, unlike most other RNAs, these molecules do not code for proteins. Due to recent research successes, one can predict a lot of potential new ncRNAs by comparing the genomes of related organisms. Technically, comparing such RNAs is challenging and computationally expensive, since related ncRNAs often show only weak similarity on the sequence level, but share similar structures. In the paper, we present the new method LocARNA for fast and accurate comparison of RNAs with respect to their sequence and structure. Using this method, we define a distance measure between pairs of ncRNAs based on sequence and structure. This is then used for combining RNAs into a cluster for identifying groups of similar RNAs in large unorganized sets of RNA. The final aim of such a comparison is to identify new classes of ncRNAs. We applied our clustering procedure to a previously published set of 3,332 predicted ncRNAs in the
