An influenza pandemic virus emerged in North America in 2009. Although the virus spread worldwide within months of its emergence, the timing of peak pandemic activity varied by nearly a year across global populations. In fact, the most intense period of pandemic activity occurred earlier in temperate countries of the southern hemisphere (e.g., South Africa, Argentina and Australia) than in countries that reported the first infections (Mexico and the US). This indicates that the timing of peak pandemic activity did not directly align with the arrival of the virus in a location, suggesting the influence of social and environmental factors on pandemic influenza transmission. In this study we examined two large pandemic outbreaks (“waves”) that occurred in summer and fall of 2009 in Mexico. The summer wave occurred in the tropical southeastern states of Mexico, whereas the larger fall wave occurred in the central and northern states. We find that the distinct pandemic waves were likely caused by complex interactions between regional differences in specific humidity, population level susceptibility, and school term cycles. Improving our understanding of the factors modulating regional transmission patterns will improve prediction of the spatial and temporal progression of future pandemics.
