We aimed to assess the prognostic significance of demographic factors, including age, sex, performance status, smoking status, obesity, and race in upper urinary tract urothelial carcinoma (UTUC) patients treated with radical nephroureterectomy through a systematic review and meta-analysis. We conducted PubMed search for all articles published until December 2014 according to Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-analysis (PRISMA) guidelines. Survival outcomes of interest were intravesical recurrence (IVR) free survival, progression free survival (PFS), cancer-specific survival (CSS), and overall survival (OS). Seventy-nine studies, including numbers of subjects ranging from 24 to 9899, met the inclusion criteria. Advanced age was significantly associated with worse PFS [hazard ratio (HR) 1.01] and OS (HR 1.05). The significant predictors of CSS were age (HR 1.02) and performance status (HR 1.35). Female gender (HR 0.81) and smoking (HR 1.38) were the significant predictors only for IVR free survival. No significant associations with survival outcomes were observed in obesity and race. Our study reveals that age is one of the most important demographic predictor of survival in UTUC. Also, male gender, poor performance status, and smoking are also significantly related to worse survival outcomes. However, large well-designed prospective studies are required to investigate the precise prognostic significance of demographics.
