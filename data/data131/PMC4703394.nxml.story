 differentiates into a dormant spore that is impervious to environmental insults. Decades of research have uncovered over 100 genes required for spore formation. Molecular dissection of these genes has revealed factors that act at every stage of this developmental process. In this study, we used a high-throughput genetic screening method called transposon sequencing to assess whether there were any sporulation genes left to be discovered. This approach identified virtually all of the known sporulation genes, as well as 24 new ones. Furthermore, transposon sequencing enabled the discovery of two new sets of mutants in which the sporulation process was either delayed or accelerated. Using fluorescence microscopy, we determined the developmental stage at which each mutant was impaired and discovered mutants that are delayed in initiation of sporulation, or defective in morphogenesis, cellâ€“cell signaling, or spore maturation. Our findings exemplify the utility of transposon sequencing to uncover new biology in well-studied processes, suggesting that it could similarly be used to identify novel genes required for other aspects of bacterial physiology, such as natural competence, stationary phase survival, or the responses to cell envelope stress and DNA damage.
