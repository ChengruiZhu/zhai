To evaluate the chemopreventive potential of quercetin in an experimental skin carcinogenesis mouse model. Skin tumor was induced by topical application of 7, 12-dimethyl Benz (a) anthracene (DMBA) and Croton oil in Swiss albino mouse. Quercetin was orally administered at a concentration of 200 mg/kg and 400 mg/kg body weight daily for 16 weeks in mouse to evaluate chemopreventive potential. Skin cancer was assessed by histopathological analysis. We found that quercetin reduced the tumor size and the cumulative number of papillomas. The mean latent period was significantly increased as compared to carcinogen treated controls. Quercetin significantly decreased the serum levels of glutamate oxalate transaminase, glutamate pyruvate transaminase, alkaline phosphatase and bilirubin. It significantly increased the levels of glutathione, superoxide dismutase and catalase. The elevated level of lipid peroxides in the control group was significantly inhibited by quercetin. Futhermore, DNA damage was significantly decreased in quercetin treated mice as compared to DMBA and croton oil treated mice. The results suggest that quercetin exerts chemopreventive effect on DMBA and croton oil induced skin cancer in mice by increasing antioxidant activities.
