GDC-0853 is a selective, reversible, and non-covalent inhibitor of Bruton’s tyrosine kinase (BTK) that does not require interaction with the Cys481 residue for activity. In this first-in-human phase 1 study we evaluated safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and activity of GDC-0853 in patients with relapsed or refractory non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) or chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). Twenty-four patients, enrolled into 3 cohorts, including 6 patients who were positive for the C481S mutation, received GDC-0853 at 100, 200, or 400 mg once daily, orally. There were no dose limiting toxicities. GDC-0853 was well tolerated and the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) was not reached due to premature study closure. Common adverse events (AEs) in ≥ 15% of patients regardless of causality included fatigue (37%), nausea (33%), diarrhea (29%), thrombocytopenia (25%), headache (20%), and abdominal pain, cough, and dizziness (16%, each). Nine serious AEs were reported in 5 patients of whom 2 had fatal outcomes (confirmed H1N1 influenza and influenza pneumonia). A third death was due to progressive disease. Eight of 24 patients responded to GDC-0853: 1 complete response, 4 partial responses, and 3 partial responses with lymphocytosis, including 1 patient with the C481S mutation. Two additional C481S mutation patients had a decrease in size of target tumors (–23% and –44%). These data demonstrate GDC-0853 was generally well-tolerated with antitumor activity.
