There were a total of 4803 incidents involving patients less than 15 years of age that the fire district responded to during 2001–2005 of which 1997 were categorized as injuries and 2806 as medical calls. The two cohorts (injured versus medical) differed in age distribution (7.7 ± 4.4 years versus 5.4 ± 4.8 years, p < 0.001) and location type of incident (school or church 12% versus 15%, multifamily residence 22% versus 13%, single family residence 51% versus 28%, sport, park or recreational facility 3% versus 8%, public building 8% versus 7%, and street or road 3% versus 30%, respectively, p < 0.001). Using the medical incident locations as controls, there was no significant clustering for environmental or assault injuries using the Bernoulli method while there were four significant clusters for all injury mechanisms combined, 13 clusters for motor vehicle collisions, one for falls, and two for pedestrian or bicycle injuries. Using the Poisson cluster method on incidence rates by census tract identified four clusters for all injuries, three for motor vehicle collisions, four for fall injuries, and one each for environmental and assault injuries. The two detection methods shared a minority of overlapping geographical clusters.
