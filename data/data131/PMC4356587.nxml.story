Smell, vision, hearingâ€”virtually all of our senses adapt their sensitivity to cope with the varying environment. Adaptation removes information about absolute stimulus intensity available to the brain, as this information is usually of little relevance for sensory representation. For some tasks, however, knowledge of absolute stimulus intensities is essential. How sensory pathways cope with this conflict remains an open question. We addressed this question in the grasshopper auditory system, in which comparison of absolute intensities of conspecific calls at both ears is crucial for mate localization. We recorded activity from three levels in the auditory pathway, showing that adaptation in the peripheral auditory system indeed removes information about absolute intensities. We discovered that strong negative feedback restricts coding of sound direction in the central auditory system to the very beginning of a stimulus, when peripheral adaptation has not yet acted. By using a computational model, we show that this central mechanism enables localization of the sound source over a wide range of stimulus intensities and that its time course is well matched to the time course of peripheral adaptation. In a final step, we confirmed predictions from our model in behavioral experiments on sound localization.
