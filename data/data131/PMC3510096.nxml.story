The degradation of coral reefs is a major threat for tropical coastal environments, worldwide. For this reason we developed a spatially explicit model which simulates competition in a benthic reef community under the influence of various environmental factors. Here we highlight the impact of two major perturbation types (mechanical disturbance events and temperature-induced bleaching events) on the long-term dynamics of a standard coral reef off Zanzibar Island, Tanzania. While mechanical disturbances are more non-specific and affect all organisms of the reef similarly, temperature-induced bleaching causes selective impact among coral species within the benthic community. Our results show clearly that complex systems which are organized of a multitude of diverse entities and hence feature complex emergent properties need to be analyzed on different integration levels rather than seen as a black box. Our tool may help to disentangle the combined effects of different perturbations and to analyze their respective impact on the benthic community of a coral reef. Hence, it will help to direct future research foci and to coordinate management measures for distinct site specific contexts.
