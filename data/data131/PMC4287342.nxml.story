In the public perception, thalidomide mainly evokes children with stunted limbs. Less known is that thalidomide continues to be a very useful drug, licensed in most countries for the treatment of multiple myelomas and leprosy. Aside from its catastrophic effect on human embryonal development, it has a manageable spectrum of side-effects and a broad range of potential indications. Interest in its further pharmacological development thus remains high, but is hindered by our limited knowledge of the reasons for its worst side-effect â€“ teratogenicity. For half a century, even the main protein target of thalidomide in the human body remained unknown, until a seminal study showed in 2010 that this was cereblon. Further progress towards a mechanistic understanding has however been limited by the difficulties in using cereblon for biochemical studies. Here we show that the thalidomide-binding region of cereblon is contained within a domain also present in other protein families, and that this domain is related to several domains with known functions. Where established experimentally, all these domains are seen to form their main substrate-binding sites at the same location in the common fold, often using residues in equivalent positions. Our findings offer the possibility to develop model systems for the study of specific aspects of cereblon activity.
