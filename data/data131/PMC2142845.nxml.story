 1. The commonly used detergents have a poisonous effect, which is due to the non-polar-polar configuration of their organic anion. The non-polar organophilic half of the ion is built up by a long chain of alkyl radicals (8 to 18 carbon atoms), the polar hydrophilic half by a sulfonate or sulfate. If brought into contact with the organic surface membrane of a cell, this structure, due to the strong attachment of the alkyl chains to its surface, and due to the pull of the hydrophilic part towards the surrounding water, is subjected to a heavy stress terminating in tearing to pieces the membrane (by denaturing and loosening the membrane components; bacteriolysis, cytolysis). Correspondingly, with frog muscle, one end of which has been treated with the detergent solution, an irreversible negative injury potential is produced. 2. Applying, instead, the compounds bearing short chains of alkyl radicals (1 to 6 carbon atoms), producing less stress on the membrane and correspondingly a slighter derangement of its architecture, a reversible positive resting potential appears. This is interpreted to be the effect of the non-polar part of the anion, which, due to its surface activity, intrudes into the pores of the membranes, notwithstanding the negative charge of their walls. 3. The short chained detergents seem to be replaceable by various organic "semidetergents," the organophilic behavior of their anion being represented by a slight chemical affinity (NH
