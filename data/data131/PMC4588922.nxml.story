Statistical differences in age, BMI, and pain chronicity by gender were not detected. Modified Harris hip scores and UCLA activity scores were significantly lower in females (54.4 vs. 63.7, p 0.005 and 6.8 vs. 8.1, p 0.014, respectively). Females were significantly more likely to have a component of lateral hip pain (38% vs. 20%, p 0.047), in addition to anterior/groin pain. Females had significantly more internal rotation range of motion in flexion than males (16.4° vs. 6.9°, p<0.001), with 58.0% and 86.0% having less than 20°, respectively (p 0.002). Males were significantly more likely than females to have elevated alpha angle (>50 in 94% vs. 70%, p 0.002) and decreased head-neck offset (<0.17 in 96% vs. 78%, p 0.007). Elevated alpha angles on the AP pelvis radiographs were more common in males with FAI compared to females (72% vs. 28%, p<0.001). A crossover sign greater than 10 mm from the acetabular sourcil was significantly more likely in males than in females (64.3% vs. 23.5%, p 0.001). Acetabular articular cartilage cleavage or defects were significantly more common in males (56% vs 24%, p 0.001). The distribution of labral lesions was not significantly different (82% vs 80% detachment).
