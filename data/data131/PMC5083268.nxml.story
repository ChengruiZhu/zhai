Sclerosing encapsulating peritonitis (SEP) is a rare cause of bowel obstruction that is characterized by the encasement of the small bowel by a thick, whitish, and fibrous membrane. The pathophysiology of SEP is poorly understood and preoperative diagnosis is difficult. Previous reports suggest that SEP may be linked to the chronic use of Î²-adrenergic blockers. A 46-year-old man with liver cirrhosis and end-stage renal disease on hemodialysis presented with recurrent abdominal pain and borborygmi. He had been taking propranolol to prevent bleeding from gastroesophageal varices for the past 15 years. Abdominal computed tomography showed ileal loops encapsulated by soft tissue with dilatation of the proximal small bowel on the right side of the abdomen. Barium follow-through showed conglomerated distal ileal loops with a cauliflower-like appearance. Explorative laparotomy revealed a thick, fibrous, whitish capsule encapsulating the ileal loops. The covering membrane was dissected and excised, resulting in an improvement in symptoms after surgery. Accordingly, a final diagnosis of SEP was made. Due to the lack of other apparent causes for SEP, we conclude that in this case, the long-term use of propranolol may be associated with the development of SEP.
