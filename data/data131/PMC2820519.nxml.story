Human color perception arises by comparing the signals from cones with peak sensitivities, at long (L), medium (M) and short (S) wavelengths. In dichromats, a characteristic distribution of S and M cones supports blue-yellow color vision: a few S and mostly M. When L cones are added, allowing red-green color vision, the S proportion remains low, increasing slowly with increasing retinal eccentricity, but the L/M proportion can vary 5-fold without affecting red-green color perception. We offer a unified explanation of these striking facts. First, we find that the spatial-chromatic statistics of natural scenes are largely symmetric between the L, M and S sensitivity bands. Thus, attenuation of blue light in the optical media, and chromatic aberration after long-wavelength accommodation of the lens, can give L/M cones an advantage. Quantitatively, information transmission by the cone array is maximized when the S proportion is low but increasing slowly with retinal eccentricity, accompanied by a lens accommodated to red light. After including blur by the lens, the optimum depends weakly on the red/green ratio, allowing large variations without loss of function. This explains the basic layout of the cone mosaic: for the resources invested, the organization maximizes information.
