Selective autophagy is a process whereby specific targeted cargo proteins, aggregates, or organelles are sequestered into double-membrane-bound phagophores before fusion with the lysosome for protein degradation. It has been demonstrated that the microtubule network is important for the formation and movement of autophagosomes. Nbr1 is a selective cargo receptor that through its interaction with LC3 recruits ubiquitinated proteins for autophagic degradation. This study demonstrates an interaction between the evolutionarily conserved FW domain of Nbr1 with the microtubule-associated protein MAP1B. Upon autophagy induction, MAP1B localisation is focused into discrete vesicles with Nbr1. This colocalisation is dependent upon an intact microtubule network as depolymerisation by nocodazole treatment abolishes starvation-induced MAP1B recruitment to these vesicles. MAP1B is not recruited to autophagosomes for protein degradation as blockage of lysosomal acidification does not result in significant increased MAP1B protein levels. However, the protein levels of phosphorylated MAP1B are significantly increased upon blockage of autophagic degradation. This is the first evidence that links the ubiquitin receptor Nbr1, which shuttles ubiquitinated proteins to be degraded by autophagy, to the microtubule network.
