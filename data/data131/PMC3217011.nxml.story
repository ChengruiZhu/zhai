, which includes other important human pathogens: rabies virus, respiratory syncytial virus, and measles virus. All of these viruses contain a single-stranded RNA genome enclosed within a helical protein assembly called the nucleocapsid. In this study, we used electron microscopy to image individual Marburg virus particles, allowing us to determine the architecture of the nucleocapsid and the positions of the viral proteins. We found that the nucleocapsid structure contained a “barbed” and a “pointed” end, and was similar to that of the related family of bullet-shaped Rhabdoviridae, which includes rabies virus. When we generated 3-D images of virus particles frozen in the act of assembling and budding from infected cells, however, we found that despite their structural similarities, Marburg virus particles are released from infected cells with the pointed end of the nucleocapsid facing out, whereas rabies virus is released with its barbed end facing out, suggesting different budding mechanisms. This study illustrates not only how electron microscopy of frozen samples can resolve structural information in vivo, but it provides knowledge of the structure of a filovirus and its assembly pathway, generated by direct 3-D imaging of infected cells, revealing similarities and differences in the assembly and budding mechanisms of members of
