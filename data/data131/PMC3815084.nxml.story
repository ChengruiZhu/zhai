Research shows that prescription drug labels are often difficult for patients to understand, which contributes to medication errors and nonadherence. In this study, the authors developed and qualitatively evaluated an evidence-based bilingual prescription container label designed to improve understanding. The authors developed several prototypes in English only or in English and Spanish. The labels included an image of the drug, an icon to show its purpose, and plain-language instructions presented in a 4-time-of-day table. In 5 focus groups and interviews that included 57 participants, patients and pharmacists critically reviewed the designs and compared them with traditional medication labels and reformatted labels without illustrations. Patients strongly preferred labels that grouped patient-relevant content, highlighted key information, and included drug indication icons. They also preferred having the 4-time-of-day table and plain-language text instructions as opposed to either one alone. Patients preferred having pertinent warnings on the main label instead of auxiliary labels. Pharmacists and Latino patients valued having Spanish and English instructions on the label, so both parties could understand the content. The final label design adheres to the latest national- and state-level recommendations for label format and incorporates additional improvements on the basis of patient and pharmacist input. This design may serve as a prototype for improving prescription drug labeling.
