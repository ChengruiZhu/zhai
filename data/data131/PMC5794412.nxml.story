(GA) in radiotherapy for liver tumors. Data of four consecutive patients with liver tumors, including two liver metastases and two hepatocellular carcinomas, were retrospectively analyzed. The GA was percutaneously placed under local anesthesia, close to the tumor. Gadolinium-ethoxybenzyl-diethylenetriamine pentaacetic acid-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was performed after the placement of the GA. Radiotherapy was designed using the volumetric modulated arc therapy technique. All procedures for placement of the GA were successfully performed with no complications. The GA exhibited various forms in the liver in the four patients. All of the GAs were well-detected on MRI, planned computed tomography (CT), and cone-beam CT. Additionally, the tadpole-like shape of the GA showed better detectability than the uptake of lipiodol emulsion and could be used for three-dimensional correlation during setup in daily image-guided radiotherapy. GA was a useful tool in image registration of radiotherapy with a high applicability. Additionally, the tadpole-like shape can be recommended for liver radiotherapy. Our findings suggest that the GA will indeed be useful in clinical practice.
