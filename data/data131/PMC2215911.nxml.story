The Ca indicator arsenazo III was introduced into cut frog twitch fibers by diffusion from end-pool segments rendered permeable by saponin. After 2-3 h, the arsenazo III concentration at the optical recording site in the center of a fiber reached two to three times that in the end-pool solutions. Thus, arsenazo III was bound to or taken up by intracellular constituents. The time course of indicator appearance was fitted by equations for diffusion plus linear reversible binding; on average, 0.73 of the indicator was bound and the free diffusion constant was 0.86 x 10(-6) cm2/s at 18 degrees C. When the indicator was removed from the end pools, it failed to diffuse away from the optical site as rapidly as it had diffused in. The wavelength dependence of resting arsenazo III absorbance was the same in cut fibers and injected intact fibers. After action potential stimulation, the active Ca and dichroic signals were similar in the two preparations, which indicates that arsenazo III undergoes the same changes in absorbance and orientation in both cut and intact fibers. Ca transients in freshly prepared cut fibers appeared to be similar to those in intact fibers. As a cut fiber experiment progressed, however, the Ca signal changed. With action potential stimulation, the half- width of the signal gradually increased, regardless of whether the indicator concentration was increasing or decreasing. This increase was usually not accompanied by any change in the amplitude of the Ca signal at a given indicator concentration or by any obvious deterioration in the electrical condition of the fiber. In voltage-clamp experiments near threshold, the relation between peak [Ca] and voltage usually became less steep with time and shifted to more negative potentials. All these changes were also observed in cut fibers containing antipyrylazo III (Maylie, J., M. Irving, N. L. Sizto, and W. K. Chandler. 1987. Journal of General Physiology. 89:83-143). They are considered to represent a progressive change in the physiological state of a cut fiber during the time course of an experiment.
