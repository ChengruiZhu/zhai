Most proteins do not function in isolation. Instead, they associate with other proteins to form complexes. Little is known about the assembly of protein complexes within cells. One possibility is that proteins are completely synthesised before they bind to each other. An alternative is that proteins attach to each other as they are being translated in the ribosome (called cotranslational assembly). To investigate if cells use cotranslational assembly to form complexes, we identified mRNAs associated with specific proteins. The expectation is that if protein A binds to protein B as protein B is being translated, A will associate indirectly to the mRNA encoding B. Indeed, we found that for âˆ¼40% of proteins (out of a sample of over 30) this was the case. Proteins associated with a small number of mRNAs, most of which encoded known or predicted interacting proteins. We found examples of this phenomenon in proteins with different functions and structures, indicating that cotranslational assembly is widespread. Cotranslational assembly might be required for certain proteins to associate, or it might be important in cases where the early formation of a protein complex is beneficial, such as when a protein is toxic or unstable unless bound to a partner.
