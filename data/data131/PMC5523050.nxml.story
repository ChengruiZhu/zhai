Lymphomas are solid malignant tumors having a wide spectrum of clinical and pathological features. Non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma (NHL) is a subtype of lymphoma with two-thirds of the cases presenting as lymph node enlargement. The remaining one third of NHL cases has been reported in the extranodal sites, including the gastro intestinal tract, Waldeyer’s ring, bone, skin, and brain. Intraoral non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma is uncommon and may affect either the jaw bones or occur within the soft tissues of the oral cavity. Here we report a case of non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma in a 65-year-old male patient who presented with a growth from the extraction socket. Non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma presenting as a growth from the extraction socket is unusual. An orthopantamograph (OPG) was taken which revealed a diffuse radiolucent defect in relation to the extraction socket of the left lower molar region. Routine hemogram, urine analysis, and chest radiograph were normal. Incisional biopsy was performed and the tissue was subjected to histopathological examination. Histopathological and immunohistochemical analysis confirmed the diagnosis of B-cell lymphoma. The patient was referred to a regional cancer institute for further management, where chemotherapy was planned. However, prior to chemotherapy, the patient was diagnosed with brain metastasis and he expired in hospital within one month.
