Ubiquitous across all kingdoms of life, the Sec translocon is an essential piece of molecular machinery for protein biosynthesis. The translocon is a transmembrane channel that enables the secretion of newly synthesized proteins across the lipid membrane, as well as the integration of protein domains into the membrane interior. Understanding the function and regulation of the translocon is necessary for developing a refined view of early stage protein folding and targeting in the cell. Although computational methods are well suited to elucidating the interactions of the translocon with newly synthesized proteins, conventional simulation techniques are unable to reach the exceedingly long timescales (i.e., minutes) that are relevant for protein biosynthesis. In this work, we present a novel coarse-grained approach that realistically models the ribosome/translocon/nascent-protein complex, while also allowing for the efficient simulation of biological timescales. The coarse-grained model is parameterized on the basis of extensive molecular dynamics simulations and enables the simulation of any nascent protein with only amino-acid sequence information as input. To validate the model, we perform over 26,000 simulations of protein biosynthesis, enabling direct comparison and demonstrating good agreement with a range of experimental studies describing this minute-timescale process.
