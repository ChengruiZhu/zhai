Mammalian respiratory complex I (CI) biogenesis requires both nuclear and mitochondria-encoded proteins and is mostly organized in respiratory supercomplexes. Among the CI proteins encoded by the mitochondrial DNA, NADH-ubiquinone oxidoreductase chain 1 (ND1) is a core subunit, evolutionary conserved from bacteria to mammals. Recently, ND1 has been recognized as a pivotal subunit in maintaining the structural and functional interaction among the hydrophilic and hydrophobic CI arms. A critical role of human ND1 both in CI biogenesis and in the dynamic organization of supercomplexes has been depicted, although the proof of concept is still missing and the critical amount of ND1 protein necessary for a proper assembly of both CI and supercomplexes is not defined. By exploiting a unique model in which human ND1 is allotopically re-expressed in cells lacking the endogenous protein, we demonstrated that the lack of this protein induces a stall in the multi-step process of CI biogenesis, as well as the alteration of supramolecular organization of respiratory complexes. We also defined a mutation threshold for the m.3571insC truncative mutation in mitochondrially encoded NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase core subunit 1 (
