The project initially brought together public health and emergency management officials to determine current gaps in technology and policy that prevent sharing of information on a consistent basis. Officials from across the National Capital Region (NCR) in Maryland, Virginia, and the District of Columbia determined that a web portal in which public health information could be securely posted on and captured by non-public health users (humans and computer systems) would be best. The development team then found open source tools, such as the Pebble blogging system, that would allow information to be posted, tagged, and searched in an easily navigable site. The system also provided RSS feeds both on the site as whole and specific tags to support notification. The team made modifications to the system to incorporate spring security features to allow the site to be securely hosted requiring usernames and passwords for access. Once the Pebble system was completed and deployed, the NCR’s aggregated ESSENCE system was adapted to allow users to submit daily reports and post time series images to the new site. An additional feature was created to post visualizations every evening to the site summarizing the day’s reports.
