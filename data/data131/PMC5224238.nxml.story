By the recent introduction of molecular targeting drugs against BRAF mutation and immune checkpoint inhibitors, the prognosis of patients with melanoma in advanced stage is now improving, but still in the minority. Mucosal melanoma lacks the BRAF mutations, and hence conventional chemotherapeutic regimens must be improved. We have conventionally used dacarbazine (DTIC) for patients with metastatic mucosal melanoma. However, the efficacy of DTIC in patients with metastatic mucosal melanoma has been limited. Therefore, we explored other possibilities to improve the prognosis of patients suffering from metastatic mucosal melanoma. In this communication, we present a retrospective analysis of the sequential combination chemotherapy of DTIC with carboplatin and paclitaxel (CP) for metastatic mucosal melanoma of nasal cavity and paranasal sinuses. The objective response rate of seven patients is 14.3% by RECIST 1.1 and the overall survival (OS) is 12.5 months. These data indicate that the sequential combination chemotherapy of DTIC with CP could be an option for patients with metastatic mucosal melanoma of nasal cavity and paranasal sinuses who are currently ending into dismal prognosis.
