Genetic studies identified many genes that are required during Drosophila oogenesis to endow the embryo with structures and components it will need to develop; they have also identified many genes that the embryo must express. However, measures of transcription have detected zygotic transcripts only after seven nuclear divisions, and many studies have concluded that zygotic mutants do not affect embryos prior to cellularization. The model that has emerged is that the earliest stages of embryogenesis rely solely on maternal stores and do not receive input from the zygotic genome. The fact that the embryo's nuclei divide rapidly with a cycling time of less than ten minutes has been interpreted to support this model, because it has been assumed that the nuclear cycle is too short for productive gene expression. Using sensitive measures of transcription and histological procedures that detect subtle differences, we found evidence for expression as early as nuclear cycle 2, and we identified a requirement for zygotic gene expression in embryos with just 2â€“4 nuclei. These findings challenge the idea that the Drosophila embryo is entirely pre-programmed and that its early development is under exclusive maternal control.
