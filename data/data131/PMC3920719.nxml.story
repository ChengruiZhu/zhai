Atrial fibrillation (AF) is associated with inflammatory and hypercoagulability state. Previous studies evaluated the safety and efficacy of dabigatran and warfarin in prevention of thrombothic complications. This study was intended to assess the influence of these drugs on hemostatic and inflammatory markers among patient underwent pulmonary vein ablation. A total of 100 patients with AF who underwent catheter ablation were randomized to treatment with dabigatran (D) 110 mg twice daily or warfarin (W) adjusted to an international normalized ratio (INR) of 2.0 to 3.0 for 3 months after ablation procedure. C - reactive protein (CRP), D-dimer, prothrombin fragment F1 + 2 (F1 + 2), were measured at baseline before ablation procedures, after 30 days and after 90 days of treatment. After 3 months, the D-dimer was 164.9 ± 48.9 in Dabigatran and 197.2 ± 58.6 in warfarin group, F1 + 2 was 0.4 ± 0.2 in dabigatran and 0.8 ± 0.2 in warfarin group and CRP level was 1.8 ± 1.6 in Dabigatran and 5.1 ± 5 in warfarin group. (All p-values < 0.05) The results showed that treatment with dabigatran made greater changes in the serum level of CRP, D-dimer, F1 + 2. The pattern of changes in serum CRP levels D-dimer, F1 + 2 is much faster and with a greater slope in the dabigatran group.
