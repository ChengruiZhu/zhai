Viruses are increasingly viewed not as pathogens that parasitize all domains of life, but as useful nanoplatforms for synthetic maneuvers in a wide range of biomedical and materials science applications. One of the most well-known examples of virus-based nanotools developed so far features viral capsules as therapeutic agents, which protect and deliver drug molecules to targeted disease sites in the human body before the drug molecules are released. In order to optimize these nano-designs to best fulfill their purposes, we first have to understand properties of the constitutive building blocks of these viral containers, so as to rationalize and guide the synthetic modification attempts. Based on the observation that viral shells are functionally unique to viruses, we hypothesize that the structure of the building blocks must also be distinct from generic proteins, given that function follows form. Our computational modeling and statistical analysis support this novel hypothesis, and recognize the folded topology of these ‘Lego’ proteins as a differentiating factor to ensure correct geometry, and consequently, proper tiling into the large complex architecture. Our findings highlight an important design principle: efforts on imparting new functionalities to virus templates should restrain from disrupting the fundamental protein fold.
