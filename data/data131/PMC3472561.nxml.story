Psoriasis is a complex disease with an expanding definition of its pathological features. We sought to expand/refine the psoriasis transcriptome using 85 paired lesional and non-lesional samples from a cohort of patients with moderate-to-severe psoriasis vulgaris who were not receiving active psoriasis therapy. This new analysis identified 4,175 probe sets (representing 2,725 unique known genes) as being differentially expressed in psoriasis lesions compared with matched biopsies of non-lesional skin when the following criteria were applied: >2-fold change and false discovery rate <0.05. These probe sets represent the largest and most comprehensive set of genes defining psoriasis at the molecular level and within the previously unidentified genes, a link to functional pathways associated with metabolic diseases/diabetes and to cardiovascular risk pathways is identified. In addition, we profiled the serum of moderate-to-severe psoriatics compared with healthy controls to assess the overlap of overexpressed lesional genes with overexpressed systemic proteins. We identified linkage of functional pathways in lesional skin associated with metabolic diseases/diabetes and cardiovascular risk with those pathways overexpressed in the serum, suggesting a potential linkage between altered gene transcription in the skin and comorbidities commonly seen in patients with moderate-to-severe psoriasis.
