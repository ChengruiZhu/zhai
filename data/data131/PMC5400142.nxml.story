A total of 11,272 patients undergoing ACL reconstruction were identified between 2007 and 2014. PT utilization steadily increased at each time point, and 89.8% of patients had at least one PT visit in the 6 months following ACL reconstruction. A total of 513 patients had subsequent ACL surgery, for a composite subsequent ACL surgery rate of 4.6%. Age under 19 years carried a higher risk of subsequent ACL surgery (8.3% vs. 3.8%, RR = 2.21, 95% CI 1.88 - 2.61, p < 0.0001). Women had a slightly higher rate of subsequent ACL surgery than men (5.1% vs. 4.2%, RR = 1.22, 95% CI 1.03 - 1.44, p = 0.02). Participation in any PT significantly decreased the risk of subsequent ACL surgery (3.9% vs. 10.6%, RR = 0.36, 95% CI = 0.30 - 0.44, p < 0.0001). Subsequent surgery rates were not affected by the number of PT visits if less than 30 visits were utilized. However, patients utilizing greater than 30 visits had a higher risk of subsequent ACL surgery (16.5% vs. 2.3%, RR = 7.15, 95% CI = 5.68 - 9.01, p < 0.0001). The total cost associated with ACL reconstruction within 24 months was $19,191 per patient. The weighted per-person average reimbursement (PPAR) for PT was $1,879, or 9.8% of the total cost of care.
