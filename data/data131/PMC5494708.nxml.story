 test, Kaplan-Meier log rank tests, Cox proportional hazard regression models and Fisher's exact tests. The median serum PN level in patients with CCA was significantly increased compared with that in healthy controls, patients with benign liver diseases and patients with breast cancer (all P<0.05). Using an optimal threshold value of 94 ng/ml PN, the diagnostic values for CCA compared with other conditions demonstrated a sensitivity level of 0.38 [95% confidence interval (CI), 0.27–0.51], specificity of 0.90 (95% CI, 0.81–0.96), accuracy of 0.66 (95% CI, 0.58–0.74), positive predictive value of 0.76 (95% CI, 0.59–0.89) and negative predictive value of 0.63 (95% CI, 0.53–0.72) (P<0.001). Furthermore, PN stain in stromal fibroblasts in CCA tissues was associated with serum PN levels (P=0.001), and patients with CCA were classified as low (≤94 ng/ml) or high PN (>94 ng/ml) accordingly. High serum and tissue PN levels were significantly associated with reduced survival rate (P<0.001 and P=0.033, respectively). Serum PN was an independent prognostic factor with a hazard ratio of 3.197 (P=0.001). In conclusion, serum PN may be used to divide patients with intrahepatic CCA into high and low PN groups. Elevated serum PN may be utilized as a marker of poor prognosis in patients with CCA.
