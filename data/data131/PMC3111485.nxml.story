Cellular identities are established by master regulatory transcription factors that promote cell typeâ€“specific gene expression. In some instances such factors also inhibit differentiation of alternative, closely related lineages. PU.1 is an Ets family transcription factor that is required for myeloid and B cell development. PU.1 is also expressed in red blood cell progenitors where it blocks erythroid terminal differentiation. One mechanism used by PU.1 to block red blood cell differentiation is by binding to and inhibiting the erythroid master regulator GATA-1. Here, we describe another mechanism utilized by PU.1 in erythroid progenitors. Using chromatin immunoprecipitation and high-throughput sequencing (ChIP-Seq) combined with gene expression profiling of erythroid progenitors, we show that PU.1 controls a large gene network in immature erythroid cells, including genes in pathways involved in regulating growth, survival, and differentiation of these cells. We also find that PU.1 controls many of the same genes and pathways in other blood cells. The results indicate that, in addition to activating lineage-specific genes, master regulatory transcription factors, like PU.1, also control numerous, widely expressed genes in multiple cell lineages.
