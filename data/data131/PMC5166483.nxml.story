No any effective treatments can prevent from the motor neuron degeneration in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) at present. In order to modulating the endogenous neural precursor cells (NPCs) to repairing the degenerative motor neurons in ALS, we studied the alteration of endogenous vimentin-containing NPCs in olfactory bulb (OB) at the different stages of SOD1 wlid-type and G93A transgenic mice. The results showed that the vimentin-containing cells (VCCs) were mainly distributed in the glomerular layer (Gl), the accessory OB (AOB), the OB core, the granular cell layer (GRO) and the mitral cell layer (MI)+the internal plexiform layer (IPL) of the OB of adult mice. Almost all VCCs in Gl, OB core and GRO were the GFAP positive cells. Almost all VCCs in AOB were the Oligo-2 positive cells. Fewer VCCs in MI+IPL were the NeuN positive cells. VCCs significantly increased in the OB core and Gl of adult OB at the pre-onset, onset and progression stages of ALS-like G93A transgenic disease, particularly in OB core. All increased VCCs were the GFAP positive cells. Our data suggested that there extensively existed the endogenous vimentin-containing NPCs in the OB of adult mice, which was a potential resource of neural stem cells, they could differentiate into astrocyte, oligodendrocyte and neuron cells, were a potential astrocyte neuroregenerative response in adult OB in the ALS-like disease, were a potential pathway to repair the degenerated motor neurons.
