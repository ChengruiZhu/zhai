The ‘Zomig Appropriate for Primary care’ programme was developed to address the needs of primary care physicians (PCPs) to improve migraine management. As part of the programme, an international, open-label, 6-month clinical study was performed. The study included new and tangible outcome variables relevant to PCPs and recruited patients presenting in primary care with an established migraine diagnosis. Patients treated up to three migraine attacks per month with zolmitriptan orally disintegrating tablet (ODT) 2.5 mg. All other migraine attacks occurring during the study period were treated with the patient's usual migraine medication (including other triptans). Questionnaires were used to record patient treatment experiences at the study end. The primary end-point was the proportion of patients wanting to continue using zolmitriptan ODT. Some 595 patients treated 7171 migraine attacks with zolmitriptan ODT. Of the 504 patients who completed the 6-month questionnaire, 380 (75.4%) wished to continue using zolmitriptan ODT. The results of the study indicate that patient-orientated end-points are more motivational and meaningful to physicians than traditional end-points used in controlled clinical trials, allowing them to make informed decisions regarding migraine management.
