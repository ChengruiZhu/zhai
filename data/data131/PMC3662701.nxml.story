DNA polymerase μ (pol μ) is an enzyme that participates in DNA repair and thus has a central role in maintaining the integrity of genetic information. To efficiently repair the DNA, discriminating the cognate instead of non-cognate nucleotides (“fidelity-checking”) is required. Here we analyze molecular dynamics simulations of pol μ bound to different non-cognate nucleotides to study the structure-function relationships involved in the fidelity-checking mechanism of pol μ on the atomic level. Our results suggest that His329, Asp330, Trp436, Gln440, Glu443, and Arg444 are of great importance for pol μ's fidelity-checking mechanism. We also observe altered patterns of correlated motions within pol μ complex when non-cognate instead of cognate nucleotides are bound, which agrees with our recently proposed hybrid conformational selection/induced-fit models. Taken together, our studies help interpret the available kinetic data of various non-cognate nucleotide insertions by pol μ. We also suggest experimentally testable predictions; for example, a point mutation like E443M may reduce the ability of pol μ to insert the cognate more than of non-cognate nucleotides. Our studies suggest an interesting relation to pol μ's unique ability to incorporate nucleotides when the upstream primer is not paired.
