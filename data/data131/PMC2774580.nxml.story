Several primary trials report the adjunctive value of psychoeducational interventions for improving stable angina symptoms, health-related quality of life (HRQL) and psychological well-being; however, few high-quality meta-analyses have examined the overall effectiveness of these interventions. We used meta-analysis in order to determine the effectiveness of psychoeducational interventions for improving symptoms, HRQL and psychological well-being in stable angina patients. Seven trials, involving 949 participants total were included. Those who received psychoeducation experienced nearly 3 less angina episodes per week, delta (Δ)= -2.85, 95% CI, -4.04 to -1.66, and used sublingual (SL) nitrates approximately 4 times less per week, Δ= -3.69, 95% CI -5.50 to -1.89, post-intervention (3-6 months). Significant HRQL improvements (Seattle Angina Questionnaire) were also found for physical limitation, Δ= 8.00, 95% CI 4.23 to 11.77, and disease perception, Δ= 4.46, 95% CI 0.15 to 8.77, but CIs were broad. A pooled estimate of effect on psychological well-being was not possible due to heterogeneity of measures. Psychoeducational interventions may significantly reduce angina frequency and decrease SL nitrate use in the short-term. These encouraging results must be interpreted with caution due to heterogeneity in methods and small samples. Larger, robust trials are needed to further determine the effectiveness of psychoeducation for stable angina management.
