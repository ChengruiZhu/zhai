Lucio phenomenon (LP) or erythema necroticans is a relatively rare, peculiar reaction pattern occurring in untreated lepromatous (LL) or borderline lepromatous (BL) leprosy cases. A 38-year-old male, a cook by occupation, was referred to the dermatology clinic from otolaryngology department with blistering over both the hands and feet of 2 days duration. He had been admitted 1 week back with epistaxis and nasopharyngeal myiasis in otolaryngology department. He was started on systemic antibiotics gentamycin, crystalline penicillin, and metronidazole with nasal instillation of turpentine oil 2 drops 6 times a day. Two days later, he had developed edema with painless hemorrhagic blistering over the dorsum of left hand followed by involvement of the right hand, dorsa of both feet, and both the earlobes within a day. Histopathology of the blister showed sub-epidermal blister, with necrotizing leukocytoclastic vasculitis of papillary dermal vessels with thrombosis, numerous acid-fast bacilli in macrophages, and macrophage granulomas extending up to subcutis. In view of the absent fever or constitutional symptoms, and the classical angular infarcts and hemorrhagic blisters evolving into ulcers with angulated margins, we considered LP as the most likely diagnosis. The patient was started on a combination of WHO recommended multibacillary anti-leprosy therapy and prednisolone (40 mg/day).
