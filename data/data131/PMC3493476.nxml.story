The amount of a given transcript in a cell is determined by a fine tuned balance of production and degradation in a complex regulatory network. Regulation of transcription controls when transcription occurs and how much mRNA is created, whereas regulation of degradation controls the rate at which messengers are destroyed. The latter mechanism has recently gained attention due to the increasing evidence of its key role in the overall co-ordination of gene expression. A long lifetime of mRNA enables a cell to produce more proteins from that mRNA. By contrast, a short lifetime rapidly alters protein levels in response to changing needs. Measuring mRNA stability is a complex and expensive experiment and, given the condition-specific response of the degradation pathway, it would be desirable to take advantage of the large variety of expression experiments stored in public databases. To this end, we developed a stochastic model to infer each specific mRNA lifetime from gene expression data. Predictions were validated using malaria data. We then applied our methodology to the reproductive and metabolic cycle of budding yeast and found, in all cases, the presence of a general principle for the proper coordination of transcription and degradation machinery.
