 pelvic resection as primary cytoreductive surgery. En bloc pelvic resection procedure is initiated by carrying a circumscribing peritoneal incision to include all pan-pelvic disease within this incision. After retroperitoneal pelvic dissection, the round ligaments and infundibulopelvic ligaments are divided. The ureters are dissected and mobilized from the peritoneum. After dissecting off the anterior pelvic peritoneum overlying the bladder with its tumor nodules, the bladder is mobilized caudally and the vesicovaginal space is developed. The uterine vessels are divided at the level of the ureters, and the paracervical tissues (or parametria) are divided. The proximal sigmoid colon is divided above the most proximal extent of gross tumor using a ligating and dividing stapling device. The sigmoid mesentery is ligated and divided including the superior rectal vessels. The pararectal and retrorectal spaces are further developed and dissected down to the level of the pelvic floor. The posterior dissection is progressed and moves to the right and then to the left of the rectum. The rectal pillars including the middle rectal vessels are ligated and divided. Hysterectomy is completed in a retrograde fashion. The distal rectum is divided using a linear stapler. The specimen is removed
