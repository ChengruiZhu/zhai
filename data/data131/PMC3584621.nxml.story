) CD gene (HB1.F3.CD) or both the CD and human IFN-β genes (HB1.F3.CD.IFN-β) and evaluated their effectiveness on gastric carcinoma cells (AGS); migration of GESTECs to AGS was analyzed as well as formation of 5-FU and IFN-β. Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was used to confirm the expression of CD and IFN-β genes in GESTECs along with confirming the production of chemoattractant molecules such as stem cell factor (SCF), CXCR4, c-Kit, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and VEGF receptor 2 (VEGFR2). In addition, by co-culturing GESTECs with AGS in the presence of 5-FC, we were able to confirm that cancer growth was inhibited, along with a synergistic effect when the CD and IFN-β genes (HB1.F3.CD.IFN-β) were co-expressed. Indeed a marked anticancer effect was demonstrated when the CD and IFN-β genes were expressed together compared to expression of the CD gene alone (HB1.F3.CD). According to a modified transwell migration assay, the migration of GESTECs toward AGS was confirmed. In conclusion, these data suggest potential application of GESTECs to gastric cancer therapy, due to a remarkable synergistic effect of CD and IFN-β genes in the presence of 5-FC. Additionally, the tumor-selective migration capability
