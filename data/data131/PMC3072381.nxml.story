In most cells, DNA is packaged by protein complexes called nucleosomes. In sperm, however, nucleosomes are only retained at a small fraction of the genome, particularly at the start sites of genes. In this work, we show that the sites at which nucleosomes are retained in sperm are specified by variation in the base composition of the human genome. At a fine scale, the human genome varies extensively in the content of GC versus AT base pairs, and we find that in both genic and non-genic regions this predicts very well where nucleosomes are retained in mature sperm. These regions include transcription start sites, especially for genes that are expressed in all cells and for genes that regulate development. We also report that regions that retain nucleosomes in sperm are likely to be protected from DNA methylation in the early embryo, suggesting a further connection between the presence of nucleosomes on the paternal genome and the establishment of gene regulation in the embryo. Based on these results, we propose that an important selective pressure on base composition evolution in mammalian genomes may be the requirement to organize chromatin in sperm in a way that facilitates gene regulation in the early embryo.
