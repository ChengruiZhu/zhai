The versatility of the tumor necrosis factor receptor superfamily members in cell fate regulation is well illustrated by the dual signaling generated by one of the most extensively studied members of the family, Fas (CD95/TNFSFR6). Upon binding its ligand, Fas is able to elicit both pro-death and pro-survival signals. Until now, we have lacked mechanistic knowledge about when and how one signaling output of Fas is favored over the other. We demonstrate here that the outcome of Fas signaling is determined by the phosphorylation status of two tyrosine residues (Y232 and Y291) within the death domain. Dephosphorylation of Fas tyrosines by SHP-1 tyrosine phosphatase turns on the pro-apoptotic signal whereas the tyrosine phosphorylation by Src family kinases (SFKs) turns off the pro-apoptotic signal and turns on the pro-survival signal. Furthermore, we provide evidence that Fas tyrosine phosphorylation status may vary among different cancer types and influence the response to anti-cancer treatments. This information reveals an opportunity to use the screening of Fas tyrosine phosphorylation, a newly discovered direct molecular indicator of Fas functional output, to aid the design of Fas-related cancer therapies.
