Zenker's diverticulum (ZD), also known as cricopharyngeal, pharyngoesophageal or hypopharyngeal diverticulum, is a rare condition characterized by an acquired outpouching of the mucosal and submucosal layers originating from the pharyngoesophageal junction. This false and pulsion diverticulum occurs dorsally at the pharyngoesophageal wall between the inferior pharyngeal constrictor and the cricopharyngeus muscle. The pathophysiology of ZD involves altered compliance of the cricopharyngeus muscle and raised intrabolus pressure. Decreased compliance of the upper esophageal sphincter and failure to open completely for effective bolus clearance both lead to an increase in the hypopharyngeal pressure gradient. Different open surgical techniques and transoral endoscopic approaches have been described for the management of ZD, although there is no consensus about the best option. We report the case of a 61-year-old patient with a 7-year history of dysphagia and odynophagia for solid food, which after 2 months progressed to dysphagia for liquids and after 4 months to regurgitation 2â€“6 h after meals. The patient experienced a 12-kg weight loss. Diagnosis was established by esophagogram, which showed a diverticulum through the posterior pharyngeal wall, suggestive of a ZD. Esophagogastroduodenoscopy showed a pouch with erythematous mucosa. Under general anesthesia, diverticulectomy and myotomy were performed. After an uneventful recovery and adequate oral intake, the patient remains free of symptoms at 4 months of follow-up.
