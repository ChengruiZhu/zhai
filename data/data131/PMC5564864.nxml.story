Over the last 50 years, the genesis of OCD lesions has been thought secondary to a primary bone necrosis origin. This theory has been challenged recently, as histological studies performed on specimens obtained from asymptomatic mammals, have revealed that ischemic necrosis of epiphyseal cartilage (rather than bone) is the precursor lesion of osteochondrosis dissecans (OCD) in several animal species. The earliest lesion identified histologically is osteochondrosis (OC) latens, in which the area of necrosis is confined to epiphyseal cartilage. As the ossification front advances, the area of necrosis causes a delay/failure in endochondral ossification that is visible radiographically and by CT and is termed OC manifesta. Juvenile osteochondritis dissecans (JOCD) in children has many similarities to OCD in animals; however, subclinical disease in children has not been studied due to the invasive nature of this work and the difficulty in obtaining appropriate cadaveric specimens. Lesions of OC latens are not recognized in children, and lesions resembling OC manifesta identified by CT are often considered to be normal ossification variants. Previous work by our group identified 32 suspected OC manifesta lesions in the medial and lateral femoral condyles (MFC and LFC) and the lateral trochlear ridge (LTR) in 14 cadaveric specimens from children ranging in age from 7 to 11 years. Our aim was to determine if skeletally immature human knees contained histological evidence of delayed endochondral ossification occurring secondary to ischemic necrosis of epiphyseal cartilage.
