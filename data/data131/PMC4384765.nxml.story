Whole transcriptome shotgun sequencing (RNA-Seq) is a useful tool for analyzing the transcriptome of a biological sample. With appropriate statistical and bioinformatic processing, this platform is capable of identifying significant differences in gene expression within the transcriptome and permits pathway and network analyses to determine how these genes interact biologically. In this study, we examined gene expression in two lung adenocarcinoma cell lines (H358 and A459) that were treated with transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) as a model for induction of the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT), commonly associated with disease progression. We performed this study in order to illustrate a workflow for identifying interesting genes and processes that are regulated early in EMT and to determine their gene pathway/network relationships and regulation. With this, we identified 137 upregulated and 32 downregulated genes common to both cell lines after TGF-β treatment that represent components of multiple canonical pathways and biological networks associated with the induction of EMT. These findings were also verified against reposited Affymetrix U133a expression profiles from multiple trials examining metastatic progression in patient cohorts (
