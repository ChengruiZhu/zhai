 In the previous paper we presented findings which indicated that enzyme heterogeneity exists among PMN leukocyte granules. From histochemical staining of bone marrow smears, we obtained evidence that azurophil and specific granules differ in their enzyme content. Moreover, a given enzyme appeared to be restricted to one of the two types. Clear results were obtained with alkaline phosphatase, but those with a number of other enzymes were suggestive rather than conclusive. Since the approach used previously was indirect, it was of interest to localize the enzymes directly in the granules. Toward this end, we carried out cytochemical procedures for five enzymes on normal rabbit bone marrow cells which had been fixed and incubated in suspension. The localization of reaction product in the granules was determined by electron microscopy. In accordance with the results obtained on smears, azurophil granules were found to contain peroxidase and three lysosomal enzymes: acid phosphatase, arylsulfatase, and 5'-nucleotidase; specific granules were found to contain alkaline phosphate. Specific granules also contained small amounts of phosphatasic activity at acid pH. Another finding was that enzyme activity could not be demonstrated in mature granules with metal salt methods (all except peroxidase); reaction product was seen only in immature granules. The findings confirm and extend those obtained previously, indicating that azurophil granules correspond to lysosomes whereas specific granules represent a different secretory product.
