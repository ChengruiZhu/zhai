The mean age (±SD) of the BD and control groups was 29.3 ± 9.2 years and 29.1 ± 10.1 years respectively. There were 24 females (55%) in the BD group and 53 females (53%) in the control group (p=0.86). The mean LCEA was 21.8° (range, 18°-25°) in the BD group and 31.7° (range, 26°-40°) in the control group (p<0.001). The mean Tönnis angle was 6.2° (range, 1°-12°) in the BD group and 2.6° (range, -10°-12°) in the control group (p<0.001). The mean preoperative alpha angle was 63.7 ± 10.3° in the BD group and 58.6 ± 13.9° in the control group (p=0.02). A subgroup analysis of alpha angle by sex showed that females had significantly lower alpha angles than males (59.2° vs 69.1°; p=0.001). Labral re-fixation and a complete capsular closure was performed in over 70% and 90% of patients in both groups respectively. At a mean follow-up of 33.2 months (range, 24-58), there was significant improvement (p<0.001) in all patient reported outcome scores in both groups. However, BD patients had smaller mean improvements in all outcomes scores, and for HOS-SSS this difference was large (difference:-6.8; p=0.112). After adjustment for age, sex, alpha angle, and pre-operative score via multiple regression there was no significant difference between the BD and control groups. Importantly, female sex did not appear to be a predictor for inferior outcomes. One patient in the BD group was revised at 13 months and is awaiting a PAO. One patient in the control group required a revision arthroscopy at 30 months.
