Many protein-protein interfaces (PPIs) are biologically compelling drug targets. Disrupting the interaction between two large proteins by a small inhibitor requires forming a high affinity binding site in the interface that generally can bind both peptides and drug-like compounds. Here we investigate whether such sites are induced by peptide or ligand binding, or already exist in the unbound state. The analysis requires comparing ligand-free and ligand-bound structures. To avoid any potential bias, we study ensembles of ligand-free protein conformations obtained by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) rather than generated by simulations. The analysis is based on computational solvent mapping, which explores the surface of the target protein by docking a large number of small “probe” molecules. Results show that ensembles of ligand-free models always include conformations that are fairly similar to some peptide-bound or ligand-bound structure in terms of the properties of the binding site. The analysis also identifies the models that are the most similar to a bound state, and shows the maximum level of similarity that is achieved without any influence from a ligand. While forming the binding site may require a combination of recognition mechanisms, there is preference for the spontaneous formation of bound-like structures.
