Serum analysis shows significant change after injury. Chondrodegradatory markers such as CTX-II, MMP-1 and MMP-3 as well as COMP indicate a progressive destruction of chondral matrix and collagen breakdown . There is a dramatic (250%) increase of CTX-II in the first 4 weeks. Matrix proteins such as MMP-1 and 3 as well as COMP show an initial increase and then a steep decline (see figure 1). Inflammatory markers (IL-1 alpha, IL-1beta, IRAP) show a decline from the time of injury. IL-1 alpha, however shows a dramatic uptake after week 2. This longitudinal data confirms a dramatic onset of early osteoarthritic biomarker profiles immediately after ACL injury as measured in synovial fluid.The administration of 40 mg of Kenalog significantly changes this dynamic. CTX-II shows a dramatic reduction and stays close to baseline levels over the course of 4 weeks pre-operatively. COMP and MMP-1 show a significantly lesser decline.There is no significant difference in the effect of Kenalog if given within 4 days of injury or within 2 weeks. There is a statistical trend indicating that a repeated dose of Kenalog may be more efficient in normalizing the biomarker levels. No AEâ€™s, infections were observed. Two of 49 patients suffered a retear at 6 months upon return to activities.
