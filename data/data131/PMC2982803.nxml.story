The microbial communities that inhabit the gastrointestinal tract of humans and other mammals are complex, dynamic, and critical to both health and disease. The composition and constituents of these communities are influenced by multiple factors such as host diet, geography, physiology, and disease state. Given the central role of the gut microbiota in the physiology of the host, it is important to determine whether it is predictable and substantially determined by the host, or variable and largely determined by the external environment (including diet) experienced by the host. A valuable way of determining the relative contributions of such factors is by comparing gut microbial communities in closely related host species. Applying a high-throughput sequencing approach, we profiled the distal gut microbiotae of great ape species sampled in their native ranges and then employed a parsimony-based analysis of phylogenetically informative phylotypes (i.e., bacterial taxa residing in multiple individuals) to determine the relationships among the diverse microbial communities. Our analyses revealed a clear species-specific signature of microbial community structure. Moreover, the pattern of relationships among the five great ape species (
