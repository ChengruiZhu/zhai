Cut muscle fibers from Rana temporaria were mounted in a double Vaseline-gap chamber and equilibrated with an end-pool solution that contained 20 mM EGTA and 1.76 mM Ca (sarcomere length, 3.3-3.8 microns; temperature, 14-16 degrees C). Sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) Ca release, delta[CaT], was estimated from changes in myoplasmic pH (Pape, P.C., D.- S. Jong, and W.K. Chandler. 1995. J. Gen. Physiol. 106:259-336). The maximal value of delta[CaT] obtained during a depleting depolarization was assumed to equal the SR Ca content before stimulation, [CaSR]R (expressed as myoplasmic concentration). After a depolarization to -55 to -40 mV in fibers with [CaSR]R = 1,000-3,000 microM, currents from intramembranous charge movement, Icm, showed an early I beta component. This was followed by an I gamma hump, which decayed within 50 ms to a small current that was maintained for as long as 500 ms. This slow current was probably a component of Icm because the amount of OFF charge, measured after depolarizations of different durations, increased according to the amount of ON charge. Icm was also measured after the SR had been depleted of most of its Ca, either by a depleting conditioning depolarization or by Ca removal from the end pools followed by a series of depleting depolarizations. The early I beta component was essentially unchanged by Ca depletion, the I gamma hump was increased (for [CaSR]R > 200 microM), the slow component was eliminated, and the total amount of OFF charge was essentially unchanged. These results suggest that the slow component of ON Icm is not movement of a new species of charge but is probably movement of Q gamma that is slowed by SR Ca release or some associated event such as the accompanying increase in myoplasmic free [Ca] that is expected to occur near the Ca release sites. The peak value of the apparent rate constant associated with this current, 2-4%/ms at pulse potentials between -48 and -40 mV, is decreased by half when [CaSR]R approximately equal to 500-1,000 microM, which gives a peak rate of SR Ca release of approximately 5-10 microM/ms.
