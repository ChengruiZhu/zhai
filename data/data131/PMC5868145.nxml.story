Plenty of studies have confirmed the prognostic values of inflammation-based prognostic scores in many malignant tumors. In present study, we aim to explore whether these indexes has same prognostic values in patients with stage T1N0 esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC). The clinicopathological data of 160 consecutive patients with pathological stage T1N0 ESCC from January 2005 to December 2012 were collected retrospectively. As prognostic factors, the inflammation-based prognostic scores, including C-reactive protein (CRP), Glasgow prognostic score (GPS), prognostic index (PI), neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio (NLR), platelet to lymphocyte ratio (PLR) and CRP to albumin ratio (CAR), were evaluated. The best cut-off values were determined by the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves. The median follow-up time was 71.8 months. During the follow-up period, 34 (21.3%) patients occurred postoperative recurrence and 30 (18.8%) tumor-related deaths were recorded. The best cut-off values of CRP, NLR, PLR and CAR were 1.090, 1.976, 103.200 and 0.023, respectively. After multivariate analysis, the GPS and CAR were identified as independently prognostic factors for overall survival (OS) (p=0.017 and 0.040, respectively). Of all 160 individuals, there were 86 (53.8%) and 85 (53.1%) patients classified into high GPS group (1-2) and elevated CAR group (>0.023), respectively. In addition, the GPS were positively associated with PI (p<0.000) and the levels of serum CRP (p<0.000), NLR (p=0.004), PLR (p=0.029) and CAR (p<0.000) and the above correlations were also observed between the CAR and other inflammation-based prognostic scores (all p<0.050, except for p=0.054 for PLR levels). The preoperative GPS and CAR were simple, inexpensive, readily available predictor for long-term survival in stage T1N0 ESCC patients who underwent esophagectomy.
