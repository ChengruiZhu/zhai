Understanding the ways in which mutations in DNA result in alterations of an organism's form and function is a major goal of molecular evolutionary biology. Changes in gene expression were long-ago proposed as a source of evolutionary diversity, but it was only in the last few years that researchers described specific cases where identified changes in DNA cause differences in gene expression, which in turn affect morphology. Attention has now turned to understanding how such sequence changes produce their effect and whether additional examples of evolutionary novelty can be found by examining the growing number of available genome sequences. Moses et al. focus on transcription factor binding sites, pieces of DNA that serve as molecular switches to turn genes on and off. These switches are organized into larger units that function as molecular computers and ensure that genes are made when and where they are needed. Moses and colleagues introduce a set of new computational methods to study how these larger units of regulatory function evolve. While they find that most of these switches remain fixed in place, a substantial number are created or destroyed by mutations, yielding new insights into the evolutionary forces that shape animal morphology.
