-stilbene) on human peritoneal mesothelial cell (HPMC)-dependent angiogenesis in vitro. To this end, angiogenic activity of endothelial cells (HUVEC, HMVEC, and HMEC-1) was monitored upon their exposure to conditioned medium (CM) from young and senescent HPMCs treated with stilbenes or to stilbenes themselves. Results showed that proliferation and migration of endothelial cells were inhibited in response to indirect (HPMC-dependent) or direct RVT activity. This effect was associated with decreased secretion of VEGF and IL-8/CXCL8 by HPMCs treated with RVT, which confirmed the experiments with recombinant forms of these angiogenic agents. Angiogenic activity of endothelial cells treated with CM from HPMCs exposed to RVT analogues was more effective. Improved migration was particularly evident in cells exposed to CM from senescent HPMCs. Upon direct treatment, RVT derivatives stimulated proliferation (but not migration) of HUVECs, and failed to affect the behaviour of HMVEC and HMEC-1 cells. These compounds stimulated production of VEGF and IL-8/CXCL8 by HPMCs. Studies with neutralizing antibodies against angiogenic factors revealed that augmented angiogenic reactions of endothelial cells exposed to CM from HPMC treated with RVT analogues were related to enhanced production of VEGF and IL-8/CXCL8. Collectively, these findings indicate that RVT and its synthetic analogues divergently alter the secretion of the angiogenic factors by HPMCs, and thus modulate HPMC-dependent angiogenic responses in the opposite directions. This may have implications for the attempts of practical employment of the stilbenes for treatment of pathologies proceeding with abnormal vascularisation of the peritoneal tissue.
