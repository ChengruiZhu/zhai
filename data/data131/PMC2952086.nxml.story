Advanced glycation end products (AGEs) are involved in cardiovascular disease. Low testosterone level is associated with increased risks of cardiometabolic disorders as well. However, which anthropometric and metabolic variables, including AGEs, are independently correlated with low testosterone is largely unknown. In this study, we investigated whether high serum level of AGEs is one of the independent determinants of low testosterone in non-diabetic men. One hundred thirteen non-diabetic men who did not receive any drugs for hypertension and dyslipidemia underwent a complete history and physical examination, determination of blood chemistries, including serum AGEs and testosterone. Univariate analysis showed that testosterone levels were associated with waist circumference (inversely), diastolic blood pressure (BP) (inversely), mean BP (inversely), triglycerides (inversely), HDL-cholesterol, fasting plasma glucose (inversely), fasting insulin (inversely), homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) (inversely), AGEs (inversely) and uric acid (inversely). By the use of multiple stepwise regression analyses, HOMA-IR (p = 0.005) and triglycerides levels (p < 0.05) remained significant and were independently related to testosterone levels (R
