Among 1507 individuals, the 1-year prevalence rate of TTH was 30.7% (n = 463), of which 4.8% reported actual disability and 21.3% had headache impact, respectively. In univariate analyses, sociodemographic variables were not associated with actual disability and headache impact, respectively. There were relationships between several headache characteristics and actual disability/headache impact. After adjustment of potential confounders, moderate headache intensity was correlated with actual disability (odds ratio [OR]: 4.41, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.46–13.27), while an inverse association was observed between no aggravation by routine activity and actual disability (OR: 0.32, 95% CI: 0.12–0.88). Multivariate analyses showed that ORs for headache impact were increased in those with higher headache frequency (OR: 2.54, 95% CI: 1.47–4.39 for 1–14 days/month; OR: 23.83, 95% CI: 5.46–104.03 for ≥ 15 days/month), longer headache time duration (OR: 1.84, 95% CI: 1.04–3.25 for ≥ 1 and < 4 hours; OR: 2.44 95% CI: 1.17–5.11 for ≥ 4 hours), and phonophobia (OR: 1.73, 95% CI: 1.02–2.95), whereas decreased in those with no aggravation by routine activity (OR: 0.32, 95% CI: 0.12–0.88).
