All mRNAs start from production in the nucleus, undergo exportation through nuclear pores and finally are degraded in the cytoplasm. A comprehensive characterization of the kinetic rates of all mRNAs is an important prerequisite for a global understanding of the regulation of the transcriptome and the cell. By conducting a time-series experiment and building a mathematical model, we trace the dynamics of mRNAs from the nucleus to the cytoplasm and determine the rates at each kinetic step at transcriptome-wide level. This information allows us to associate mRNA kinetic rates with a wealth of biological features and made some intriguing discoveries. We show mRNA decay is positively linked to transcript length while mRNA export is negatively linked to the length of the 3' UTR. We show binding of splicing factors is associated with faster rates of mRNA export. We provide evidence for global coordination between nuclear export an decay of mRNA. We show genes sharing specific functions tend to have similar nucleoplasmic kinetics, in which ribosomal proteins possessing special kinetic features exclusively stand out. Altogether, our integrated approach to quantitatively determine the rates of kinetic steps on a gene-by-gene basis provides a blueprint to obtain the global understanding of RNA regulation.
