). About 1 in every 4 patients (25.3%) had diabetes, and 60.7% had dyslipidemia. Mean blood pressure was 132.5/77.9 mmHg, and 55.0% of all patients had controlled BP; 62.4% of non-diabetic patients, and 33.3% of diabetic hypertensive patients, had BP controlled to recommended levels. Most (81.7%) hypertensive patients had â‰¥ 1 cardiometabolic risk factor, and 12.2% had all 3 risk factors. As compared to hypertensive patients without additional risk factors, adjusted odds ratios for BP control were significantly lower for all combinations of CMRFCs (ORs 0.15-0.83, all p < 0.04), with the exception of patients who had only dyslipidemia in addition to hypertension (OR = 1.09, p = NS). Prescriber adherence to recommended hypertension treatment guidelines for patients with diabetes, heart failure, or prior myocardial infarction was high. Although patients with risk factors were prescribed more antihypertensive medications than those without, hypertensive patients with all 3 risk factors were prescribed a mean of 2.4 antihypertensive medications compared to 1.7 for those with no risk factors; odds of BP control in these patients, however, was 0.23 [95% CI 0.19-0.29] that of patients with no other CMRFCs.
