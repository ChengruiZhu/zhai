As our population ages the incidence of neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer’s disease (AD), is predicted to increase dramatically. Despite providing important symptomatic relief, existing treatments for such conditions do not slow-down disease progression, and this will cause an overwhelming future burden on our healthcare system and immense suffering for many more patients and their families. Nrf2 is a gene that normally protects cells from stressful conditions. Although we don’t know why, Nrf2 is reduced in the brains of AD patients and this may explain the increased susceptibility of neurons to damage in neurodegenerative diseases. Our research, using a fruit fly model, identifies Keap1, a negative regulator of Nrf2, as a valid target for the rescue of AD-related Nrf2 defects and the subsequent prevention of neuronal degeneration. Moreover, we show that a new compound, which directly blocks the binding between Nrf2 and Keap1, can prevent toxicity of the AD-initiating Aβ peptide in mouse neurons. Hence, our study provides strong evidence that direct Keap1-Nrf2 disruptors can specifically target the defects in Nrf2 activity observed in neurodegenerative diseases, and supports the further development of such compounds as potential new drugs to prevent neuronal decline AD and other neurodegenerative conditions.
