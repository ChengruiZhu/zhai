A recent psychophysical experiment showed that participants do adjust their decisions (change their mind) based on further evidence, which was processed only after the first decision was made. The established notion of (perceptual) decision-making as a decision variable evolving in time until a termination criterion is reached does not incorporate these changes of mind. In the biophysically-realistic attractor model, the mean firing rates of neural populations encoding the decision alternatives act as the decision variable. In line with neurophysiological evidence from decision-related neurons in the lateral intraparietal cortex, a decision is made if a fixed firing rate threshold is crossed. We propose here that a change of mind is induced if this decision threshold is crossed a second time, namely by the neural population encoding the initially losing alternative, which thus overtakes the population that first crossed the decision threshold. Interestingly, we found this more likely to happen the further the system is pushed towards a regime where decision-making is no longer unambiguous, but both neural populations can fire at elevated rates. This, besides, corresponds to higher incoming activity and thus faster and less accurate decisions and suggests that the brain operates over the whole range of inputs enabling decision-making.
