Among the oncolytic virotherapy, an emerging treatment for tumor, adenoviruses are widely used at present in preclinical and clinical trials. Traditionally, oncolytic adenoviruses were developed based on the human adenovirus serotype 5 (AdHu5). However, AdHu5 has the drawbacks of preexisting anti-AdHu5 immunity in most populations, and extensive sequestration of Adhu5 by the liver through hexon, blood coagulation factor X (FX), and FX receptor interactions. To tackle these problems, we explored a novel oncolytic adenovirus AdC7-SP/E1A-ΔE3 for cancer treatment. AdC7-SP/E1A-ΔE3 was constructed by replacing the E1A promoter with tumor specific promoter survivin promoter and deleting E3 region using direct cloning methods based on simian adenovirus serotype 24 (namely AdC7). We showed that AdC7-SP/E1A-ΔE3 significantly killed tumor cell lines NCI-H508 and Huh7, and inhibited tumor growth in both NCI-H508 and Huh7 xenograft tumor models. Importantly, AdC7-SP/E1A-ΔE3 exhibited the antitumor efficacy via systemic administration. Mechanistically, infected cells were killed by AdC7-SP/E1A-ΔE3 via the p53-independent mitochondrial apoptosis pathway in which phosphorylation of BAD markedly declined and the expresses of Bik significantly went up. Therefore, AdC7-SP/E1A-ΔE3 is a promising candidate for liver and colon tumor treatment.
