Neurons have extremely long axonal processes that can reach lengths of up to 1 meter in human peripheral nerves. The neuronal cell body response to nerve injury is dependent on signals carried by molecular motors from the lesion site in the axon. The distance between the injury site and the cell body influences the type of response, suggesting that neurons must be able to estimate the distance of an axonal injury site, although how they do this is unknown. We have used a computational approach to model intracellular distance measurement after nerve injury. The models show the feasibility of a mechanism based on a rapid, near instantaneous, signal carried by action potentials in the nerve, followed by multiple slower signals carried on molecular motors. Such a mechanism can enable a neuron to discriminate between distances as close as 10% of total axon length. The model provides insights on retrograde injury signaling in neurons, including the biological relevance of the mechanism over different scales of nerves and organisms. Moreover, if similar mechanisms function in synapse to nucleus signaling in uninjured neurons, this could enable estimation of relative process lengths, thus guiding metabolic output from cell bodies to axons.
