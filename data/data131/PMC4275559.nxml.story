 was not amplified and two normal breast cell lines. To pinpoint the main kinases driving HER2 signaling, we performed a comprehensive siRNA screen that identified loss of the HER2/HER3 heterodimer as having the most prominent inhibitory effect on the growth of HER2+ breast cancer cells. In a second siRNA screen focused on identifying genes that could sensitize HER2+ cells to trastuzumab treatment, we found that loss of signaling members downstream of phosphatidylinositol 3 kinase (PI3K) potentiated the growth inhibitory effects of trastuzumab. Loss of HER2 and HER3, as well as proteins involved in mitogenic and environmental stress pathways inhibited the proliferation of HER2+ cells only in the absence of trastuzumab, suggesting that these pathways are inhibited by trastuzumab treatment. Loss of essential G2/M cell cycle mediators or proteins involved in vesicle organization exerted inhibitory effects on HER2+ cell growth that were unaffected by trastuzumab. Furthermore, the use of a sensitization index (SI) identified targeting the PI3K pathway to sensitize to trastuzumab treatment. Antagonism using the SI identified MYO3A, MYO3B and MPZL1 as antagonizers to trastuzumab treatment among HER2+ cell lines. Our results suggest that the dimerization partners of HER2 are important for determining the activation of downstream proliferation pathways. Understanding the complex layers of signaling triggered downstream of HER2 homodimers and heterodimers will facilitate the selection of better targets for combination therapies intended to treat HER2+ breast cancers.
