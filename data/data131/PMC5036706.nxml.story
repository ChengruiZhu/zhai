This work deals with the natural degradation of leachate from an old reclaimed landfill by means of a biological pond. Hamra is a municipal waste landfill with a limited formation of leachate, which has already been reclaimed. Leachate in this location is disposed of using natural biogeochemical method, and it is subsequently discharged into a surface stream. The main issue dealt with here is the long-term effectiveness of natural degradation of leachate and the limits of its use. The solutions of these fundamental questions took advantage of a database of analytical assessments collected during a long-term monitoring of the landfill site. The primary degradation trends and the long-term development have been revealed and described on the basis of these assessments. The main benefit of the biological pond is the dilution of the dominant contaminants, especially of inorganic character. In the case of ammonium ions, they show nitrification caused by their transition from the reduction into oxidizing environment. From a long term point of view, the disadvantage of natural degradation of leachate can be seen in the gradual reduction in efficiency due to the concentration of the substances or an undesired growth of water plants, which can be successfully eliminated, for example, by means of targeted aeration and by maintaining vegetation in the pond and its surroundings. The biological potential of the locality is very favorable and, despite its anthropogenic load, it creates a location with suitable living conditions for many water animals and plants. That is why it can be concluded that the efficiency of the natural biochemical cleaning elements can be considered as sufficient, taking into account the nature of the deposited waste, the quantity and quality of leachate, as well as the climate character of the locality.
