Drug Utilization Evaluation (DUE) studies facilitate assessing the appropriateness and rational use of medications.The goal of the present study was to evaluate Amphotericin B usage in neutropenic patients. A prospective DUE study was performed in Hematology-Oncology and Stem Cell Transplantation wards at Taleghani hospital for one-year. National comprehensive cancer network, clinical practice guidelines in oncology, American Hospital Formulary Service and other relevant medical practice and up-to dated articles were used to evaluate whether Amphotericin B is properly used according to the guidelines. All data collected by a pharmacist in daily review using information of physician and nursing records as well as laboratory findings. During the one-year study, 35 patients receiving amphotericin B were evaluated. 29 patients (82.9%) received amphotericin B due to neutropenia and fever and 6 patients had confirmed fungal infections. All of the injectable solutions of amphotericin B were appropriately prepared for intravenous infusion. In addition, for all patients, ordering (indication) of the study drug was in accordance with the guidelines. Twenty-five (71.4%) patients received an appropriate dose according to the guidelines. Duration of treatment was properly selected in 21 (60%) patients. Twenty-two (62.8%) patients developed hypokalemia as the most frequent adverse drug event. Although, preparation and indication of amphotericin B was in compliance with the current guidelines, dosage and duration of treatment were considered to be incoherent with the designed protocol used in this study. We conclude more attention should be paid to dosage and duration of treatment with amphotericin B in order to optimize its administration.
