Spatially guided behavior and spatial memory are central subjects in behavioral neuroscience. Many tasks have been developed for laboratory investigations of these subjects since no single task can reveal their full richness. Here we turn to the simplest and oldest “task”, which involves no task at all: introducing a mouse into a large arena and tracking its free behavior. Traditionally, the test is used for studying emotionality and locomotor behavior, using simple summaries of the mouse's path such as its length and the percent of time spent away from walls. More sophisticated computational analysis of the dynamics of the path enables us to separate visiting behavior at locations into stops and passings. Using this distinction, the mouse's path reveals quantifiable locational memory: the mouse's decision to stop in a location is based on its visiting history there. In some strains of mice, the visited locations gradually become places of attraction where the mouse stops habitually. In other strains, the phenomenon is not evident at all. Such quantifiable characterization of locational memory now enables further exploration of the senses that mediate this type of memory and allows measurement and comparisons across mouse strains and across genetic and pharmacological preparations.
