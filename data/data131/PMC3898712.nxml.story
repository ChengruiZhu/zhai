Melanoma is an aggressive cancer that metastasizes rapidly, and is refractory to conventional chemotherapies. Identifying miRNAs that are responsible for this pathogenesis is therefore a promising means of developing new therapies. We identified miR-26a through microarray and qRT-PCR experiments as an miRNA that is strongly down-regulated in melanoma cell lines as compared to primary melanocytes. Treatment of cell lines with miR-26a mimic caused significant and rapid cell death compared to a negative control in most melanoma cell lines tested. In surveying targets of miR-26a, we found that protein levels of SMAD1 and BAG-4/SODD were strongly decreased in sensitive cells treated with miR-26a mimic compared to the control. The luciferase reporter assays further demonstrated that miR-26a can repress gene expression through the binding site in the 3â€²UTR of SODD. Knockdown of these proteins with siRNA showed that SODD plays an important role in protecting melanoma cells from apoptosis in most cell lines sensitive to miR-26a, while SMAD1 may play a minor role. Furthermore, transfecting cells with a miR-26a inhibitor increased SODD expression. Our findings indicate that miR-26a replacement is a potential therapeutic strategy for metastatic melanoma, and that SODD in particular is a potentially useful therapeutic target.
