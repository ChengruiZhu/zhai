Cardiovascular diseases are the leading cause of death in the world. Coronary artery diseases, atrial fibrillation or hypertensive heart disease, are among the most important cardiovascular disorders. Hypertension represents a significant risk factor for cardiovascular mortality; thus, control of high blood pressure has become a priority to prevent major complications. Although the choice of drugs for treating hypertension remains controversial, extensive clinical evidences point to calcium channel blockers as first-line agents. Diltiazem, a non-dihydropyridine calcium channel blocker, is an effective and safe antihypertensive drug, alone or in combination with other agents. Diltiazem lowers myocardial oxygen demand through a reduction in heart rate, blood pressure, and cardiac contractility, representing also a good alternative for the treatment of stable chronic angina. Furthermore, diltiazem reduces conduction in atrioventricular node, which is also useful for heart rate control in patients with atrial fibrillation. In this review, clinical experts highlight studies on diltiazem effectiveness and safety for the treatment of several cardiovascular diseases and make evidence-based recommendations regarding the management of diltiazem in the clinical practice.
