Protein–RNA interactions play important roles in the biological systems. Searching for regular patterns in the Protein–RNA binding interfaces is important for understanding how protein and RNA recognize each other and bind to form a complex. Herein, we present a graph-mining method for discovering biological patterns in the protein–RNA interfaces. We represented known protein–RNA interfaces using graphs and then discovered graph patterns enriched in the interfaces. Comparison of the discovered graph patterns with UniProt annotations showed that the graph patterns had a significant overlap with residue sites that had been proven crucial for the RNA binding by experimental methods. Using 200 patterns as input features, a support vector machine method was able to classify protein surface patches into RNA-binding sites and non-RNA-binding sites with 84.0% accuracy and 88.9% precision. We built a simple scoring function that calculated the total number of the graph patterns that occurred in a protein–RNA interface. That scoring function was able to discriminate near-native protein–RNA complexes from docking decoys with a performance comparable with that of a state-of-the-art complex scoring function. Our work also revealed possible patterns that might be important for binding affinity.
