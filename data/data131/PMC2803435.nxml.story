We describe the application of a new QSAR (quantitative structure-activity relationship) formalism to the analysis and modeling of PDE-4 inhibitors. This new method takes advantage of the X-ray structural information of the PDE-4 enzyme to characterize the small molecule inhibitors. It calculates molecular descriptors based on the matching of their pharmacophore feature pairs with those (the reference) of the target binding pocket. Since the reference is derived from the X-ray crystal structures of the target under study, these descriptors are target-specific and easy to interpret. We have analyzed 35 indole derivative-based PDE-4 inhibitors where Partial Least Square (PLS) analysis has been employed to obtain the predictive models. Compared to traditional QSAR methods such as CoMFA and CoMSIA, our models are more robust and predictive measured by statistics for both the training and test sets of molecules. Our method can also identify critical pharmacophore features that are responsible for the inhibitory potency of the small molecules. Thus, this structure-based QSAR method affords both descriptive and predictive models for phosphodiesterase-4 inhibitors. The success of this study has also laid a solid foundation for systematic QSAR modeling of the PDE family of enzymes, which will ultimately contribute to chemical genomics research and drug discovery targeting the PDE enzymes.
