Concomitant OC injury was present in 59/101 patients, MEN pathology was present in 52/101 patients and both OC/MEN injury was present in 33/101 patients at the time of ACLR. One-way ANOVA determined that patients with OC injury had lower IKDC (p=0.001), KOOS pain (p=0.0-14), and KOOS Sport (p=0.002) scores than patients with no OC pathology. Patients with MEN pathology presented with lower KOOS Sport scores (p=0.03). Patients with combined OC/MEN injury had lower IKDC (p=0.009), KOOS ADL (p=0.024) and KOOS Sport (p<0.001) scores. Chi square analysis demonstrated that patients with an OC injury were nearly 3 times (OR=2.9; 95% CI, 1.1-7.8) more likely to present with an IKDC score below previously reported age-matched (18-24 years/old) general population norms (female=85.7, male=89.1) and also 3 times (OR=3.2; 95% CI, 1.4-7.6) more likely to score below age-matched norms of patients with no prior history of knee injury (female=93.4, male=95.5). Patients with combined OC/MEN pathology were nearly 4 times (OR=3.9; 95%CI, 1.3-11.4) more likely to present with an IKDC score below healthy age-matched norms. MEN pathology did not increase the likelihood of presenting with IKDC scores lower than population.
