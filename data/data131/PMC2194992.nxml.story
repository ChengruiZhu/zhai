 A study has been made of the electrical responses to direct stimulation of the exposed cerebral cortex of cats that had been immobilized with neuromuscular blocking drugs, and whose muscle and skin wounds had been locally anesthetized. The characteristics and spread of the first and second surface-negative responses are described. It was found that the first surface-negative response to weak stimuli decays linearly to zero at 3 to 6 mm. from the point of stimulation. Intermediate stimuli cause farther and non-linear spread: responses are re-initiated, or reinforced, at 6 to 10 mm.; and supramaximal stimulation produces reinforcement both at 5 and at 10 mm. The conduction velocity of these responses is uniform for linear spread (0.7 to 2.0 m./sec.), but reinforced responses occur 1 to 3 msec. earlier than would be expected for simple conduction. The phenomenon of re-initiation, or reinforcement, depends upon the excitatory state of the brain; circulation and previous stimulation are important factors. Connections outside the gyrus matter only in so far as they provide other sources of general excitation. It is concluded that two types of transmission: slow and fast, can lead to generation of similar surface-negative responses. The suggestion is made that the slowly conducted surface-negative potentials are due to direct or to synaptic excitation of pyramidal cells; while the responses with shortened latency are initiated synaptically on other pyramidal cells after fast conduction at about 10 m./sec. in tangential fibres.
