The domestic and foreign scholars have studied naked mole rats more focused on the respect such as its long life, resistant to low oxygen, little spontaneous tumor, but the study of the immune system is little. In this study, we compared the anatomy and tissue morphology of NMR and ICR mouse spleens and found that the gross appearance of the NNMR spleen differed from ICR. There were more macrophages in NNMR spleens than in ICR spleens. Furthermore, we focused on the differences of macrophages. We compared their phagocytic capabilities and the data showed that NNMR macrophages are more phagocytic than ICR mouse macrophages. We also used polyI:C and LPS to stimulate the NMR and ICR macrophages and then measured the immune response as expression of certain TLR signaling molecules. After stimulation, there was a lower increase in apoptosis of NMR macrophages than ICR macrophages and a non-significant increased expression of TLRs in NMR macrophages than in ICR macrophages. In contrast, NF-κB proteins increased more significantly in NMR’s than in ICR’s and the expression of downstream cytokines in NMR macrophages also increased more than in ICR macrophages. Based on these results, we hypothesize that in addition to being able to eat foreign matter, NMR macrophages can activate the TLRs, start the NF-κB and produce a large number of cytokines to enhance immune response, so as to protect the body from outside interference when the virus or bacteria invading.
