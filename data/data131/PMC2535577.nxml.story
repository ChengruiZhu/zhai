Human evolutionary history has been investigated mainly through the prism of genetic variation of the Y chromosome and mitochondrial DNA. These two uniparentally inherited markers reflect the demographic history of males and females, respectively. Their contrasting patterns of genetic differentiation reveal that women are more mobile than men among populations, which might be due to specific marriage rules. However, these two markers provide only a limited understanding of the underlying demographic processes. To obtain an independent picture of sex-specific demography, we developed a new multi-locus approach based on the analysis of markers from the autosomal and X-chromosomal compartments. We applied our method to 21 human populations sampled in Central Asia, with contrasting social organizations and lifestyles. We found that, in patrilineal populations, not only the migration rate but also the number of reproductive individuals is likely to be higher for women. This result does not hold for bilineal populations, for which both the migration rate and the number of reproductive individuals can be equal for both sexes. The social organization of patrilineal populations is the likely cause of this pattern. This study suggests that differences in sex-specific migration rates may not be the only cause of contrasting male and female differentiation in humans, and that differences in effective numbers do matter.
