To which extent a single neuron can influence brain circuits/networks dynamics? Why only a few neurons display such a strong power? These open questions are inspired by recent experimental observations in developing and adult neuronal circuits, as well as by classical debates within the framework of the single neuron doctrine. In this work we identify and present a mechanism which can explain in neuronal circuits, at some early stage of their development, how and why only a few specific neurons can exhibit such power. For this purpose, we consider a standard neuronal network model whose population activity is characterized by bursting behavior. The introduction of a distribution of correlated neuronal excitabilities and degrees, inspired by the simultaneous presence of younger and older neurons in the network, leads to the emergence of functional hub neurons. These critical cells, whenever perturbed, are capable of suppressing network synchronization. Notably, we show that their strong influence on the population dynamics is not related to their structural properties, but to their operational and structural integration into a clique. These results highlight how network-wide effects can be induced by single neurons without any need for a specific topological architecture.
