Postmenopausal osteoporosis (PMO) increases bone fragility and the risk of fractures, and impairs the healing procedure of bone defects in aged women. The stromal cell-derived factor-1α (SDF-1α)/CXC chemokine receptor type 4 (CXCR4) axis helps to maintain the biological and physiological functions of bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs) and increase the homing efficiency of BMSCs. The present study aimed to provide insights into the possible association between migration and osteogenic ability and the SDF-1α/CXCR4 axis in BMSCs derived from a rat model of PMO. In order to do this, the general and SDF-1α/CXCR4-associated biological characteristics as well as associated molecular mechanisms in BMSCs isolated from a PMO rat model (OVX-BMSCs) and normal rats (Sham-BMSCs) were investigated and compared. In comparison with Sham-BMSCs, OVX-BMSCs exhibited an impaired osteogenic ability, but a stronger adipogenic activity as well as a higher proliferative ability. In addition, OVX-BMSCs presented a lower chemotactic activity towards SDF-1α, lower expression levels of CXCR4 and reduced levels of phosphorylated AKT (p-AKT). Therefore, the lower expression levels of CXCR4 and p-AKT may be responsible for the impaired osteogenic ability and lower chemotactic activity towards SDF-1α of OVX-BMSCs.
