It is now being recognized that complex diseases should be studied from the perspective of dys-regulated pathways and processes rather than individual genes. Indeed, various combinations of molecular perturbations might lead to the same disease. In such cases, responses to these perturbations are expected to converge to common pathways. In addition, signals that are associated with each individual perturbation might be weak, rendering studies of complex diseases particularly challenging. Aiming to provide an integrated perspective on complex disease mechanisms we developed a novel computational method to simultaneously identify causal genes and dys-regulated pathways. Starting with an identification of a disease-associated set of genes and their statistical associations with genomic alterations, we utilized graph-theoretical techniques and combinatorial algorithms to determine potential paths from the genomic causes through a network of molecular interactions. We applied our method to sets of genomic alterations and gene expression profiles of Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) patients, uncovering candidate causal genes and causal paths that are potentially responsible for the altered expression of disease associated target genes. While copy number alterations and gene expression data of GBM patients provided opportunities to test our approach, our method can be applied to any disease system where genetic alterations play a fundamental causal role, and provides an important step toward the understanding of complex diseases.
