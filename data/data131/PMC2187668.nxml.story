Immunization with the 69-kD outer membrane protein (OMP) of Bordetella pertussis protected neonatal mice against lethal respiratory challenge with B. pertussis 18323. Active immunization elicited a serum IgG anti- 69-kD OMP response at the time of challenge, with IgG anti-69-kD OMP antibodies detected in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid after challenge. Intravenous administration of BPE8, a monoclonal IgG1 anti-69-kD OMP, also protected young mice against B. pertussis challenge. Intravenously injected BPE8 was detected in the lungs of mice at the time of aerosol challenge, suggesting that the presence of specific antibody in the lungs may mediate protection. Thus the 69-kD OMP of B. pertussis is a protective antigen in mice that elicits specific serum antibody that can transude to the lung. The 69-kD OMP was detected in a preparation of a Takeda acellular vaccine by immunoblot analysis and a serum antibody response to the 69-kD OMP was observed in 18-mo-old children boosted with this preparation of Japanese acellular vaccine. Our results demonstrate that the B. pertussis 69-kD OMP is a protective antigen in animals, is immunogenic in humans, and is present in a preparation of acellular pertussis vaccine that is widely used in Japan. These findings indicate that the 69-kD OMP should be seriously considered as a candidate for inclusion in new formulations of antigenically defined acellular pertussis vaccines.
