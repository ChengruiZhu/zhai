CD151, a member of the tetraspanin family proteins, tightly associates with integrin α3β1 and localizes at basolateral surfaces of epithelial cells. We found that overexpression of CD151 in A431 cells accelerated intercellular adhesion, whereas treatment of cells with anti-CD151 mAb perturbed the integrity of cortical actin filaments and cell polarity. E-Cadherin puncta formation, indicative of filopodia-based adhesion zipper formation, as well as E-cadherin anchorage to detergent-insoluble cytoskeletal matrix, was enhanced in CD151-overexpressing cells. Levels of GTP-bound Cdc42 and Rac were also elevated in CD151-overexpressing cells, suggesting the role of CD151 in E-cadherin–mediated cell–cell adhesion as a modulator of actin cytoskeletal reorganization. Consistent with this possibility, engagement of CD151 by the substrate-adsorbed anti-CD151 mAb induced prominent Cdc42-dependent filopodial extension, which along with E-cadherin puncta formation, was strongly inhibited by calphostin C, a protein kinase C (PKC) inhibitor. Together, these results indicate that CD151 is involved in epithelial cell–cell adhesion as a modulator of PKC- and Cdc42-dependent actin cytoskeletal reorganization.
