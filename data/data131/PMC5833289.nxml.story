HIV-1 infection typically requires lifelong treatment because a class of infected cells called latently infected cells remains hidden from drugs and host immune responses and can reignite infection when treatment is stopped. Massive efforts are ongoing to devise ways to eliminate latently infected cells. The most advanced of the strategies developed for this purpose involves using drugs called latency-reversing agents (LRAs), which reactivate latently infected cells, effectively bringing them out of their hiding. Multiple mechanisms are involved in the establishment of latency. Pairs of LRAs targeting distinct mechanisms have been found to synergize and induce significantly higher latency-reversal than individual LRAs. If this synergy can be maximized, latency-reversal can be achieved with minimal drug exposure. Using stochastic simulations of HIV-1 latency, we unraveled a trade-off between synergy and efficacy in LRA pairs. Drug concentrations that maximized synergy did not also maximize latency-reversal. Drug concentrations that yielded higher latency-reversal compromised synergy and vice versa. This trade-off would constrain the synergy realizable between LRAs and guide the identification of optimal LRA combinations that would maximize synergy while ensuring adequate latency-reversal.
