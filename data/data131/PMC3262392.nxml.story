Two women with rheumatoid arthritis refractory to standard therapies are reported here. One was treated with tocilizumab and the other with anakinra, and both developed toxic liver effects. Liver biopsy in both cases showed focal necrosis of hepatocytes – a hallmark of drug toxicity – with steatosis and early fibrosis. Inflammatory infiltrates were prominent in the patient treated with anakinra but not in the tocilizumab-treated patient. However, FibroTest (Assistance publique – Hôpitaux de Paris, Paris, France) in the latter patient showed an inflammatory activity of A2 and was staged as F2, and the histology also showed hemorrhagic areas. Although both patients were overweight and both had been exposed to steroids, the steatosis and steatohepatitis were considered to be related to drug hepatotoxicity. Other possible etiologies for liver injury were excluded. Discontinuation of anakinra led to rapid normalization of liver enzymes. The patient receiving tocilizumab developed hepatosplenomegaly but had normal liver enzymes. In spite of the hepatosplenomegaly, the tocilizumab treatment was continued since the patient had not responded to other drugs. There was a good response to the tocilizumab treatment and the liver biopsy showed only insignificant, reversible liver injury. At follow-up at 6-months the patient remains stable.
