Human and wildlife diseases can be tracked by looking at incidence, which is the number of new infections per time unit (typically day, week or month). While theoretically this would only be a matter of counting the number of newly infected individuals, in reality these data are difficult to acquire due to limited sampling possibilities and undetectable cases. This means that a method must be used to estimate the real incidence using a limited amount of data. For many infections, the concentration and quality of antibodies changes predictably over time, which means that one could use the antibody level at any point in time to back-calculate how much time passed since the infection entered the body. Other information, such as the age of the individual, or the presence of the pathogen, can also help to estimate when an individual became infected. Improving on existing methods, we developed a method that allows the use of a wide range of information sources for estimating individual time since infection. Using arenavirus infection in mice, we show that this method works well when sufficient background data are available, and that it can greatly improve the estimation of incidence patterns.
