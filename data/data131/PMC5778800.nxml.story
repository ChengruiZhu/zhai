Colorectal cancer is a common malignant tumor of the digestive tract with high morbidity and mortality rates. The aim of the present study was to examine the expression level of KiSS-1 in tumor tissues of patients with colorectal cancer, and to explore the relationship with the clinicopathology and prognosis of patients with colorectal cancer. Frozen tumor tissue and corresponding cancer-adjacent normal tissue specimens were selected from 56 patients with colorectal cancer who were treated in the Department of Surgery of our hospital from May 2009 to December 2011. The expression levels of KiSS-1 messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) in tumor tissues and cancer-adjacent normal tissues were detected by reverse transcriptase-quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR). The expression levels of KiSS-1 proteins in colorectal cancer tissues and cancer-adjacent normal tissues were further detected by immunohistochemistry. In addition, the association of the expression level of KiSS-1 proteins in tissues of colorectal cancer patients with pathological parameters and the prognosis of patients with colorectal cancer was analyzed combined with clinical data. The RT-qPCR results showed that the expression of KiSS-1 mRNA in colorectal cancer tissues was significantly lower than that in cancer-adjacent normal tissues (P<0.05). Immunohistochemistry results indicated that the positive expression rate of KiSS-1 proteins in colorectal cancer tissues (26.79%) was significantly lower than that in cancer-adjacent normal tissues (80.36%). The low expression of KiSS-1 in colorectal cancer tissues was associated with the degree of differentiation, invasion and metastasis, as well as clinical staging. The 5-year overall survival rate of patients with colorectal cancer was 55.36% (31/56). The univariate survival analysis showed that patients with lowly expressed KiSS-1 had worse prognosis. The low expression of KiSS-1 is closely associated with the occurrence and development of colorectal cancer, especially to the degree of differentiation, invasion and metastasis, as well as clinical staging. Thus, the expression of KiSS-1 in colorectal cancer tissues can be used as a reference for the prognosis of colorectal cancer, and KiSS-1 is a potential new target for the treatment of colorectal cancer.
