The aim of this paper is to describe and evaluate the feasibility of an expanded endoscopic transcanal transpromotorial approach (ExpTTA) to the internal auditory canal and the cerebellopontine angle. To this end, we performed a cadaveric dissection study in September 2015. In total, 2 heads (4 sides) were dissected focusing on anatomical landmarks and surgical feasibility. Data from dissections were reviewed and analysed for further consideration. In all 4 sides of the cadavers the procedure was feasible. In all cadavers, it was necessary to extensively drill the temporo-mandibular joint and to calibrate the external ear canal to allow adequate room to manoeuver the instruments and optics and to comfortably access the cerebellopontine angle. In addition, thorough skeletonisation of the carotid artery and the jugular bulb were necessary for the same purpose. In conclusion, ExpTTA appeared to be successful to access the internal auditory canal and cerebellopontine angle region. Potential extensive and routine application of this type of approach in lateral skull base surgery will depend on the development of technology and surgical refinements and on the diffusion of skull base endoscopic skills among otolaryngologists and neurosurgical community.
