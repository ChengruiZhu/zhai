Sensitivity of cancer cells to DNA damaging chemotherapeutics is determined by DNA repair processes. Consequently, cancer cells may upregulate the expression of certain DNA repair genes as a mechanism to promote chemoresistance. Here, we report that RECQ1, a breast cancer susceptibility gene that encodes the most abundant RecQ helicase in humans, is a p53-regulated gene, potentially acting as a defense against DNA damaging agents. We show that RECQ1 mRNA and protein levels are upregulated upon treatment of cancer cells with a variety of DNA damaging agents including the DNA-alkylating agent methylmethanesulfonate (MMS). The MMS-induced upregulation of RECQ1 expression is p53-dependent as it was observed in p53-proficient but not in isogenic p53-deficient cells. The RECQ1 promoter is bound by endogenous p53 and is responsive to p53 in luciferase reporter assays suggesting that RECQ1 is a direct target of p53. Treatment with the chemotherapeutic drugs temozolomide and fotemustine also increased RECQ1 mRNA levels whereas depletion of RECQ1 enhanced cellular sensitivity to these agents. These results identify a previously unrecognized p53-mediated upregulation of RECQ1 expression in response to DNA damage and implicate RECQ1 in the repair of DNA lesions including those induced by alkylating and other chemotherapeutic agents.
