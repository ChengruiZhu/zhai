Murine lymphoid cells respond rapidly to bacterial lipopolysaccharide or antigen-antibody complexes to initiate or accelerate the blood coagulation pathways. The monocyte or macrophage has been identified as the cellular source, although lymphocyte collaboration is required for the rapid induction of the procoagulant response. This procoagulant activity is identified in the present study as a direct prothrombin activator, i.e., a prothrombinase. Studies with plasmas deficient in single coagulation factors demonstrate that the induced murine procoagulant activity effector molecule does not require factors XII, VIII, VII, X, or V, but does require prothrombin to transform fibrinogen to fibrin. This enzyme(s) produces limited proteolysis of prothrombin to yield thrombin or thrombinlike products that are functionally capable of converting fibrinogen to fibrin. The prothrombinase is undetectable in freshly isolated Murine lymphoid cells respond rapidly to bacterial lipopolysaccharide or antigen-antibody complexes to initiate or accelerate the blood coagulation pathways.
