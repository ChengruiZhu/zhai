Agonistic antibodies directed against immunostimulatory receptors belonging to the tumor necrosis factor receptor (TNFR) superfamily are emerging as promising cancer immunotherapies. Several Fc engineering approaches discovered recently can augment the anti-tumor activities of TNFR antibodies by enhancing their agonistic activities and/or effector functions. In this study, we compared these approaches for their effects on an anti-OX40 antibody. Both S267E/L328F and V12 mutations facilitated enhanced binding to FcγRIIB and thus increased FcγRIIB cross-linking mediated agonist activity. However, both mutations abrogated the binding to FcγRIIIA and thereby decreasing the antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity activities. In contrast, the E345R mutation, which can promote antibody multimerization upon receptor binding, facilitated anti-OX40 antibody to have increased agonism by promoting the clustering of OX40 receptors without the dependence on FcγRIIB cross-linking. Nonetheless, cross-linking to FcγRIIB can lead to a further boost of the agonism of the anti-OX40 antibody with IgG1 Fc but not with the silent IgG2σ Fc. The antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity and complement-dependent cytotoxicity activities of the anti-OX40 antibody with the E345R mutation were affected by the choice of IgG subtypes. However, there was little change in the antibody-dependent cellular phagocytosis activity. In summary, different Fc engineering approaches can guide the design of engineered antibodies to OX40 and other TNFR with improved anti-tumor activity.
