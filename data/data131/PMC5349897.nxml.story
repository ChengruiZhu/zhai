neutrophilgelatinase-associated lipocalin is currently one of the most interesting and enigmatic proteins involved in the development of malignancies. In this study, we found that the expression of neutrophilgelatinase-associated lipocalin was up-regulated in endometrial cancer tissues and cell lines, significantly increased in early-grade ones, suggesting it may serve as a biomarker for early-stage screening for endometrial carcinoma. Moreover, neutrophilgelatinase-associated lipocalin was up-regulated in Ishikawa cells under going epithelio-mesenchymal transition induced by epidermal growth factor (5 ng/ml). Up-regulation of neutrophilgelatinase-associated lipocalin may correlate with the down-regulation of E-cadherin expression, up-regulation of Vimentin expression, enhanced cell migration, invasion and proliferation, which are the typical hallmarks of epithelio-mesenchymal transition processes. neutrophilgelatinase-associated lipocalin may play a dual role during tumorigenetic and developmental processes of endometrial carcinoma. These results suggested neutrophilgelatinase-associated lipocalin to be a potential molecular target in the early diagnosis and treatment of endometrial carcinoma. Further studies are warranted to clarify the molecular mechanisms behind the expression and function of neutrophilgelatinase-associated lipocalin and epithelio-mesenchymal transition.
