A 44-year-old male patient had been on regular hemodialysis three times per week, with 4-hour sessions since December 2003. The etiology of his renal failure was unknown and the patient had no systemic disease when hemodialysis was started, painful, erythematous skin lesions were detected over and around the external malleolus of the right foot. In the next two months, erythematous skin lesions gained a necrosed character and spread into the malleolar and posterior tibial region and back of the ankle in both extremities. The patient showed no clinical signs of recovery and despite anti-biotherapy, debridement and protective measures, the skin lesions got infected and presented as intolerable, painful wounds. The patient was diagnosed with calcific uremic arteriolopathy (CUA) and hospitalized for parathyroidectomy. All parathyroid glands were removed after having checked quick PTH intraoperatively. A small amount of parathyroid tissue was intramuscularly auto-implanted into the right forearm .Skin lesions showed fast improvement in further follow-ups. Three months after parathyroidectomy, iPTH value was measured as 1197 pg/ml. After 6 months of medical treatment, iPTH was found as 970 ng/L and we decided to remove the implanted parathyroid tissue from the right forearm.
