Iron is an essential nutrient for life and is involved in many important processes such as oxygen transport and DNA synthesis. However, excess amounts of iron can cause carcinogenesis by producing reactive oxygen species. Thus, the cellular transport of iron must be tightly regulated. In the human body, iron may be present as heme or non-heme iron. The mechanisms governing the cellular transport of these forms have not been clearly elucidated. We previously reported that the expression of an important heme transporter, heme carrier protein 1 was regulated by cancer-specific reactive oxygen species derived from mitochondria. In this study, we have asked if mitochondrial reactive oxygen species may also be related with non-heme iron transport. In order to address this question, we have investigated the relationship between mitochondrial reactive oxygen species and accumulation of cellular non-heme iron in a rat gastric normal, cancer and manganese superoxide dismutase-overexpressing cancer cell line, in which reactive oxygen species from mitochondria are specifically scavenged. We have also analyzed the expression of divalent metal transporter 1 and ferroprotin, involved in the incorporation and excretion of non-heme iron, respectively, as well as a hypoxia-related transcription factor HIF-1Î±, to elucidate the molecular mechanism of non-heme iron accumulation.
