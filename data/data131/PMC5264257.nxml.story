Oxidative stress and apoptosis are the most important pathologic features of ischemic heart disease. Recent research has indicated that microRNAs (miRs) play an essential role in apoptosis. However, whether miRs might regulate B cell lymphoma-2 (Bcl-2) protein in apoptosis during ischemic heart disease is still unclear. The aim of this study, therefore, was to confirm the regulation of microRNA-135a (miR-135a) in oxidative stress injuries induced by hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) in rat cardiomyoblast cells H9c2. To this end, we analyzed the effects of H2O2 treatment on miR-135a expression in rat cardiomyocytes. Furthermore, we upregulated and inhibited miR-135a using mimics and inhibitors, respectively, and examined the effects on cell viability and apoptosis-related proteins. We observed that miR-135a was markedly up-regulated under H2O2 treatment in rat cardiomyoblast cells. Overexpression of miR-135a blocked the Bcl-2 protein and enhanced the apoptosis induced by H2O2, and miR-135a inhibition restored Bcl-2 protein expression. Interestingly, miR-135a inhibition did not attenuate H2O2-induced apoptosis with Bcl-2 knockdown. The results of the present study indicate that miR-135a regulates H2O2-induced apoptosis in H9c2 cells via targeting Bcl-2, and that miR-135a may be a novel therapeutic target for ischemic heart disease.
