This study was designed to evaluate the efficacy of several treatment modalities, including CHOP based concurrent chemoradiotherapy (CCRT), for the patients with stage IE or IIE nasal extranodal NK/T-cell lymphoma (nasal ENKL). The cases were retrieved between 2000 and 2010 (n=94), and were followed to the end of February 2016. The patients were grouped into A (chemotherapy alone; CT alone), B (sequential treatment) and C (CCRT). For those with efficacy evaluation for overall treatment (n=90), CR was attained in 60.0% (18/30), 69.8% (30/43) and 76.5% (13/17) patients in the group A, B and C, respectively. The 5-year OS rate was 35.2%, 41.9% and 70.6% in the group A, B and C, respectively. For patients with early stage diseases (IE and IIE), the ECOG performance status and the Ann Arbor stage were significant prognostic factors for both OS and PFS. Among the stage IE patients, besides the ECOG performance status, three prognostic factors which related to treatments (treatment modalities, efficacy of initial and overall treatment) were significant against OS or PFS. In conclusion, compared to chemotherapy alone and sequential treatment, nasal ENKL patients in early stages, especially stage IE, benefit the most from CHOP based concurrent chemoradiotherapy.
