). However, the contact times and concentrations used in those studies are by far higher than occur in WWTPs. Since sulphide can influence the biological nitrogen and phosphorus removal processes, this research aimed to understand how the different electron acceptors commonly present in biological nutrient removal (BNR) systems can affect the proliferation of SRB. For this purpose, a culture of SRB was enriched in a sequencing batch reactor (approx. 88% of the total bacteria population). Once enriched, the SRB were exposed for 2 h to typical concentrations of electron acceptors like those observed in BNR systems. Their activity was assessed using three different types of electron donors (acetate, propionate and lactate). Oxygen was the most inhibiting electron acceptor regardless the carbon source used. After exposure to oxygen and when feeding acetate, an inactivation time in the sulphate reduction activity was observed for 1.75 h. Once the sulphate reduction activity resumed, only 60% of the original activity was recovered. It is suggested that the proliferation of SRB is most likely to occur in BNR plants with an anaerobic fraction higher than 15% and operating at sludge retention times higher than 20 days (at a temperature of 20 °C). These results can be used to implement strategies to control the growth of sulphate reducers that might compete for organic carbon with phosphate-accumulating organisms.
