Mathematical models of infectious diseases are increasingly used to inform policy decisions. The advantages of such models are that multiple control options can be rapidly tested and compared, without the risks and costs associated with field experiments. However, for such models to be practically useful tools detailed data (both in terms of populations and epidemiology) are required. In many countries, such as the USA, individual-level demographic information on livestock farms is generally lacking. However, remotely sensed information (such as satellite images and land-use maps) provides the potential to generate these data or produce surrogate populations. In this paper we use land cover data to predict farm locations in the UK and investigate the effect of a precise knowledge of farm locations upon epidemiological predictions in the event of a foot-and-mouth disease epidemic. Our results show that, when highly resolved land cover data are used to predict farm locations, accurate predictions of epidemic sizes, durations and preferred intervention strategies can be obtained. This suggests that land cover data may be used in countries where individual farm-level data are not available, to allow for analyses to be carried out regarding the likely spread of disease in future outbreaks.
