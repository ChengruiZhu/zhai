Ischiofemoral impingement (IFI) is a rare cause of hip pain defined by a narrowing of the space between the lateral aspect of the os ischium and the lesser trochanter of the femur. Several underlying anatomic, functional and iatrogenic pathologies have been identified for symptomatic IFI in native hip joints and after total hip arthroplasty. Clinical symptoms vary but most commonly consist of pain of the lower buttock and groin including the inner thigh, and a snapping or clunking phenomenon is often reported. Symptoms may be provoked by a combined extension, adduction and external rotation during physical examination and during long-stride walking. Radiographs of the pelvis and an axial or false-profile-view of the hip as well as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-scans should be obtained to strengthen the diagnosis. On MRI, the quadratus femoris muscle signal and the space confined by the anatomic structures surrounding the muscle, the quadratus femoris space, are to be assessed. Targeted infiltration of the muscle can be helpful both diagnostically and therapeutically. The literature on differential diagnoses and treatment options for IFI is limited; therapeutic suggestions are offered only in case reports and series. With this work, we aim to give a systematic approach to the non-surgical and surgical treatment options for IFI based upon the current literature and the authorsâ€™ personal experience.
