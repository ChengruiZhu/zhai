An 1.5 Ã— 7.5 cm dorsal skin flap with the pedicle orientated, centered, and remaining attached between the lower angles of the scapulae was elevated in 45 Wistar rats in different phases, depending on the group. Rats were divided in five groups of nine. In group A, injections of saline were administered, in equally divided spaces, into flap's fascia and transposed to a created skin defect. In group B, injections of VEGF were applied subdermally, in equally divided spaces, within the limits of a predesigned flap, a week prior to flap dissection and transposition. In group C, injections of VEGF were applied into a recipient bed's fascia just before flap raising and transposition. In group D, injections of VEGF were applied subdermally, only in the distal third of the flap and then the flap was transposed to a recipient area. Finally, in group E, injections of VEGF were applied in the flap intrafascially and in equally divided spaces and then again, the flap was transposed to a recipient area. A week after final flap raising and positioning, rats were euthanatised and flaps were excised. Specimens were photographed, measured, put in formalin 10% and were sent for histological and image analysis.
