The Ministry of Health and Welfare of Korea recently designated cerebrovascularspecified centers (CSCs) to improve the regional stroke care system for acute ischemic stroke (AIS) patients. This study was performed to evaluate the changes in the flow of AIS patients between hospitals and to describe the role of the Emergency Medical Information Center (EMIC) after the designation of the CSCs. Data for coordination of interhospital transfers by the EMIC were reviewed for 6 months before and after designation of the CSCs. The data included the success or failure rate, the time used for coordination of interhospital transfer, and the changes in the interhospital transfer pattern between transfer-requesting and transfer-accepting hospitals. The total number of requests for interhospital transfer increased from 198 to 244 after designation of the CSCs. The median time used for coordination decreased from 8.0 minutes to 4.0 minutes (p<0.001). The success rate of coordination increased from 88.9% to 96.7% (p<0.001). The proportion of requests by CSCs decreased from 3.5% to 0.4% (p=0.017). However, the proportion of acceptance by non-CSC hospitals increased from 15.9% to 25.8% (p=0.015). With the designation of CSCs, the EMIC could coordinate interhospital transfers more quickly. However, AIS patients are more dispersed to CSC and non-CSC hospitals, which might be because the CSCs still do not have sufficient resources to cover the increasing volume of AIS patients and non-CSC hospitals have changed their policies. Further studies based on patients' outcome are needed to determine the adequate type of interhospital transfer for AIS patients.
