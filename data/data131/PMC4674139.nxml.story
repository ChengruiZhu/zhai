Protein interactions are central for many cellular processes. Physical characterization of these interactions is essential for understanding of life processes and applications in biology and medicine. Because of the inherent limitations of experimental techniques and rapid development of computational power and methodology, computer modeling is a tool of choice in many studies. Publicly available information from biomedical research is readily accessible on the Internet, providing a powerful resource for modeling of proteins and protein complexes. A major paradigm shift in modeling of protein complexes is emerging due to the rapidly expanding amount of such information, which can be used as modeling constraints. Text mining has been widely used in recreating networks of protein interactions, as well as in detecting small molecule binding sites on proteins. Combining and expanding these two well-developed areas of research, we applied the text mining to physical modeling of protein complexes (protein docking). Our procedure retrieves published abstracts on a protein-protein interaction and extracts the relevant information. The results show that correct information on binding can be obtained for about half of protein complexes. The extracted constraints were incorporated in a modeling procedure, significantly improving its performance.
