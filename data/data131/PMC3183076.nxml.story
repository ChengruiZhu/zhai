Sexual reproduction consists in fusing two complementary gametes carrying only one set of chromosomes (haploids) to form a cell with two sets of homologous chromosomes (diploid). Gametes are generated through meiosis, a specialized cell division occurring in diploid organisms. For proper meiotic division to occur, homologous chromosomes need physical connections acquired through recombination that exchange chromosome arms (crossovers) and thereby contribute to genetic diversity. Recombination is induced by numerous chromosome breakages, but only a subset yields crossover recombinants, the remaining yielding non-crossover recombinants. Control of crossover formation is poorly understood. For this reason, precise knowledge of the meiotic recombination mechanisms is essential. Current models are based on studies performed at a few loci in model organisms. We revisited these models using an original approach that allowed us to study the DNA scars left at all chromosome breakage sites during single meioses in baker's yeast. We found that crossover formation is more dynamic than anticipated, which led us to propose variations of current crossover formation models. We also revealed that a significant fraction of non-crossovers do not arise from the canonical pathway, raising the possibility of a common pathway with crossover formation.
