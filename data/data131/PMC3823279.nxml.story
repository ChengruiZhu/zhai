= 25) group, respectively. Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), glucose-regulated protein 78 (GRP78), superoxide dismutase (SOD) and malondialdehyde (MDA) in the infarcted myocardium were evaluated by Western blotting, real-time PCR and colorimetry, respectively, at 1 hr, 1 day and 1 week after laser irradiation. Cell survival was assayed with quantitative real-time PCR to identify Y chromosome gene and apoptosis was assayed with transferase-mediated dUTP end labelling staining. Capillary density, myogenic differentiation and left ventricular function were tested by immunohistochemistry and echocardiography, respectively, at 1 week. After LLLI precondition, increased VEGF and GRP78 expression, as well as the enhanced SOD activity and inhibited MDA production, was observed. Compared with BMSC transplantation and culture media injection group, although there was no difference in the improved heart function and myogenic differentiation, LLLI precondition significantly enhanced early cell survival rate by 2-fold, decreased the apoptotic percentage of implanted BMSCs in infarcted myocardium and thus increased the number of newly formed capillaries. Taken together, LLLI precondition could be a novel non-invasive approach for intraoperative cell transplantation to enhance cell early survival and therapeutic potential.
