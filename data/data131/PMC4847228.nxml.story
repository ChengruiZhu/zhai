Targeted temperature management (TTM) (primarily therapeutic hypothermia (TH)) after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) has been considered effective, especially for adult-witnessed OHCA with a shockable initial rhythm, based on pathophysiology and on several clinical studies (especially two randomized controlled trials (RCTs) published in 2002). However, a recently published large RCT comparing TTM at 33 °C (TH) and TTM at 36 °C (normothermia) showed no advantage of 33 °C over 36 °C. Thus, this RCT has complicated the decision to perform TH after cardiac arrest. The results of this RCT are sometimes interpreted fever control alone is sufficient to improve outcomes after cardiac arrest because fever control was not strictly performed in the control groups of the previous two RCTs that showed an advantage for TH. Although this may be possible, another interpretation that the optimal target temperature for TH is much lower than 33 °C may be also possible. Additionally, there are many points other than target temperature that are unknown, such as the optimal timing to initiate TTM, the period between OHCA and initiating TTM, the period between OHCA and achieving the target temperature, the duration of maintaining the target temperature, the TTM technique, the rewarming method, and the management protocol after rewarming. RCTs are currently underway to shed light on several of these underexplored issues. In the present review, we examine how best to perform TTM after cardiac arrest based on the available evidence.
