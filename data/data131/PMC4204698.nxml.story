Colonoscopy is currently regarded as the gold standard and preferred screening method for colorectal cancer (CRC). Recently, however, a limitation of colonoscopy in the prevention of CRCs has been identified, particularly in the right-sided colon, and the problem of so-called interval cancers has emerged. The prevalence of interval cancer is estimated to be between 4% and 8% of CRCs detected. Although the exact etiology of interval cancer remains unknown, factors implicated in the development of interval cancers include missed lesions at the time of colonoscopy, incomplete resection of previous neoplastic lesions, different tumor biology, and serrated pathway of carcinogenesis. However, recent evidence suggests that interval cancers are related to the training of the endoscopist and quality of the colonoscopy rather than tumor biology. Therefore, the importance of adequate training and continuous monitoring of the colonoscopy quality, which are amenable to improvement, cannot be overstated in order to prevent the risk of interval cancers. In this study, the current literature regarding the prevalence and potential factors related to interval cancers and colonoscopy quality-related issues are reviewed.
