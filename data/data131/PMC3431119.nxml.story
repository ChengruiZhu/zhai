Morbid obesity has become a global epidemic during the 20th century. Until now bariatric surgery is the only effective treatment for this disease leading to sustained weight loss and improvement of comorbidities. The sleeve gastrectomy is becoming a promising alternative for the gold standard the gastric bypass and it is gaining popularity as a stand-alone procedure. The effect of the laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy is based on a restrictive mechanism, but a hormonal effect also seems to play an important role. Similar results are achieved in terms of excess weight loss and resolution of comorbidities compared to the gastric bypass. Inadequate weight loss or weight regain can be treated by revisional surgery. Complication rates after LSG appear to be lower compared with gastric bypass. General guidelines recommend bariatric surgery between the age of 18 and 65. However bariatric surgery in the elderly seems safe with respect to weight loss and resolution of comorbidities. At the same time weight loss surgery is more often performed in adolescent patients failing weight loss attempts. Even though more studies are needed describing long-term effects, there is already enough evidence that this technique is an effective single procedure for a considerable proportion of obese patients.
