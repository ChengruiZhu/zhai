Twelve cases were excluded from analysis for a total of 96 cases (in 92 patients). Forty patients had general anesthesia alone (Group A) and 56 patients had a pre-operative femoral nerve block prior to the induction of general anesthesia (Group B). There was no significant difference between the groups with regard to gender, age, weight, height, BMI, ASA classification, or type of procedure performed. Patients who received a femoral nerve block had a significantly shorter operative time and received a significantly lower total intra-operative morphine-equivalent dose than those patients who did not receive a block. Post-operative pain scores were lower at all time points for the femoral nerve block group, however statistical significance was seen only at the 60 minute post-operative time point (p < 0.05). Patients who did not receive a block had significantly higher morphine-equivalent doses in the PACU. There was no difference in rates of nausea and vomiting and time to discharge from the PACU between the two groups. Oxycodone consumption in the surgical day care unit (SDCU) was similar between groups, but the femoral nerve block patients had significantly lower pain scores prior to discharge from the SDCU. Two patients in Group A group were admitted to hospital post-operatively due to inadequate post-operative pain control. No complications were noted in any patient with regard to the femoral nerve block.
