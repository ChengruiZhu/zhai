Adoptive T cell therapy has emerged as a powerful strategy to treat human cancers especially haematological malignancies. Extension of these therapies to solid cancers remains a significant challenge especially in the context of defining immunological correlates of clinical responses. Here we describe results from a clinical study investigating autologous Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-specific T cells generated using a novel AdE1-LMPpoly vector to treat patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) either pre-emptively in at-risk patients with no or minimal residual disease (N/MRD) or therapeutically in patients with active recurrent/metastatic disease (ARMD). Tolerability, safety and efficacy, including progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS), were evaluated following adoptive T-cell immunotherapy. Twenty-nine patients, including 20 with ARMD and nine with N/MRD, successfully completed T-cell therapy. After a median follow-up of 18.5 months, the median PFS was 5.5 months (95% CI 2.1 to 9.0 months) and the median OS was 38.1 months (95% CI 17.2 months to not reached). Post-immunotherapy analyses revealed that disease stabilization in ARMD patients was significantly associated with the functional and phenotypic composition of
