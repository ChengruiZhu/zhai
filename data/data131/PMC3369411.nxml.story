A 41-year-old woman was admitted to our hospital with abdominal pain that developed about 1 year after a Cesarean section. Pelvic computed tomography (CT) revealed diffuse dilation of the small intestine with fluid shadows and a pelvic tumor 55 mm in diameter. The density of the tumor, which was not enhanced by intravenous contrast medium, was diffuse and similar to that of muscular tissue, whereas the density of a capsule surrounding the mass was relatively high. T1- and T2-weighted pelvic magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the tumor revealed the same diffuse low-intensity signals as muscular tissue, and diffuse high-intensity signals, respectively. The CT and MRI findings were consistent with those of a gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST) causing ileus of the small intestine. As inserting an ileus tube did not improve her symptoms, the patient was scheduled for tumor resection. The operative findings revealed a hard, solid tumor adhering to the surrounding small intestine. The macroscopic findings revealed that the tumor consisted of layers of stratified gauze surrounded by a thick granulomatous wall. The gossypiboma was considered to have originated from gauze that had been left behind after the Cesarean section. If a patient has a history of surgery, the possibility of gossypiboma should be considered when CT or MRI findings indicate features of GIST.
