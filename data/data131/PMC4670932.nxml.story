The mechanisms that regulate proliferation, fate decisions and differentiation of hematopoietic stem cells (HSC) and thymic stem cells are highly complex. Several signaling pathways including Wnt signaling have important roles during these processes. Both canonical and non-canonical Wnt signaling are important in normal and malignant hematopoiesis and lymphoid development, yet their precise roles are controversial. In a side-by-side comparison, we investigated the roles of the canonical and non-canonical Wnt pathway in hematopoiesis and thymopoiesis. As complete loss-of-function models for non-canonical Wnt signaling are not yet available and highly complex for canonical Wnt signaling, we decided to use a gain-of-function approach. To this end, Wnt3a and Wn5a, two well-known prototypical canonical and non-canonical Wnt ligands were produced in hematopoiesis supporting stromal assays. High levels of Wnt3a signaling blocked T-cell development at early stages, whereas intermediate levels accelerated T-cell development. In contrast, Wnt5a signaling prompted apoptosis in developing thymocytes, without affecting differentiation at a particular stage. To explore the role of Wnt3a and Wnt5a
