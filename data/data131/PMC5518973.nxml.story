 study was to evaluate the infiltration capability and rate of microleakage of a low-viscous resin infiltrant combined with a flowable composite resin (RI/CR) when used with deproteinised and etched occlusal subsurface lesions (International Caries Detection and Assessment System code 2). This combined treatment procedure was compared with the exclusive use of flowable composite resin (CR) for fissure sealing. Twenty premolars and 20 molars revealing non-cavitated occlusal carious lesions were randomly divided into two groups and were meticulously cleaned and deproteinised using NaOCl (2%). After etching with HCl (15%), 10 premolar and 10 molar lesions were infiltrated (Icon/DMG; rhodamine B isothiocyanate (RITC)-labelled) followed by fissure sealing (G-ænial Flo/GC; experimental group, RI/CR). In the control group (CR), the carious fissures were only sealed. Specimens were cut perpendicular to the occlusal surface and through the area of the highest demineralisation (DIAGNOdent pen, KaVo). Using confocal laser-scanning microscopy, the specimens were assessed with regard to the percentage of caries infiltration, marginal adaption and internal integrity. Within the CR group, the carious lesions were not infiltrated. Both premolar (57.9%±23.1%) and molar lesions (35.3%±22.1%) of the RI/CR group were uniformly infiltrated to a substantial extent, albeit with significant differences (
