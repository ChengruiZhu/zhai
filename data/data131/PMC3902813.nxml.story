A total of 157 physicians responded to our survey: 61 (38.9%) infectious disease specialists, 33 (21.0%) pulmonologists, and 63 (40.1%) other physicians. Two-thirds (96/157, 61.2%) had positions in tertiary and secondary hospitals; the others (61, 38.8%) worked in primary clinics (hospitals and private clinics). One hundred and eight (68.8%) were aware of the Korean CAP clinical guidelines; of these, 98 (62.4%) applied the guidelines to their practice. Among physicians using them, 86.7% (85/98) reported the guidelines to be most useful for empirical selection of antibiotics, and 75.2% (118/157) said the guidelines were useful and satisfactory. Sixty-eight (43.3%) respondents indicated that they had not used aminoglycosides as an initial empirical CAP treatment, while 51 (32.5%) had combined aminoglycosides with other antibiotics to treat patients with CAP. Seventy-three (46.5%) physicians often combined macrolides with β-lactam antibiotics for empirical treatment of CAP, and 21 (13.4%) reported using macrolide monotherapy (which is not recommended in the 2009 Korean CAP treatment guidelines) for CAP patients. The most commonly used β-lactams were third-generation cephalosporins (72, 45.9%) and ampicillin/sulbactam or amoxicillin/clavulanate (28, 17.8%).
