Although there is good agreement that light reduces the amount of cyclic GMP (cGMP) in the retina, the exact time-course of this decrease is not well established. Bullfrog retinal sections were isolated under infrared light and quick-frozen with liquid nitrogen-cooled, metal hammers after exposure to various intensities of continuous illumination. This quick-freezing should stop the degradation of cGMP within 50-100 ms. The frozen retinal sections were then slowly warmed up in the presence of perchloric acid to denature enzymes involved in cGmp metabolism. cGMP was determined by radioimmunoassay and comparison was made between light- and dark-adapted retinal sections from the same animal. The average cGMP concentration was 44.3 +/- 0.7 pmol cGMP/mg protein or 170.9 +/- 3.2 pmol cGMP/retina. After 1 s of illumination no significant change in cGMP concentration was found even with the brightest light used (approximately 7 x 10(7) rhodopsins bleached/second per rod. At this intensity the first significant decrease in cGMP from dark-adapted levels was detected 3-5 s after the initiation of illumination; cGMP decayed to 70-75% of the dark-adapted value after approximately 30 s. With lower intensity illumination the cGMP levels recovered to dark-adapted levels after the initial decrease even though the bleaching light remained on.
