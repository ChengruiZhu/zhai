Influenza epidemics occur annually, and incur significant losses in terms of lost productivity, sickness, and death. Policy makers employ countermeasures, such as vaccination campaigns, to combat the occurrence and spread of infectious diseases, but epidemics exhibit a wide range of behavior, which makes designing and planning these efforts difficult. Accurate and reliable numerical forecasts of how an epidemic will behave, as well as advance notice of key events, could enable policy makers to further specialize countermeasures for a particular season. While a large amount of work already exists on modeling epidemics in past seasons, work on forecasting is relatively sparse. Specially tailored models for historical data may be overly strict and fail to produce behavior similar to the current season. We designed a framework for predicting epidemics without making strong assumptions about how the disease propagates by relying on slightly modified versions of past epidemics to form possibilities for the current season. We report forecasts generated for the 2013–2014 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) “Predict the Influenza Season Challenge”, and assess its accuracy retrospectively.
