Inflammation is associated with chronic disease. High-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) is a predictor of chronic disease. The dietary inflammatory index (DII) is used to determine the overall inflammatory potential of diet. A cross-sectional analysis of Health Examinee cohort data (2012–2014) from Korea was performed. Subjects were 40–79 years of age (8,332 males; 19,754 females). The DII was used to analyze the relationship between subject characteristics, nutrient intake, and the hs-CRP. Additionally, the relationship between DII and hs-CRP as a predictor of chronic disease was examined. The DII was divided into 4 quartile: Q1 = −7.21 to −1.88 (median: −3.020), Q2 = −1.87 to −0.02 (median: −0.410), Q3 = −0.01 to 1.87 (median = 0.870) and Q4 = 1.88 to 7.34 (median = 3.040). For each group, the carbohydrate/protein/fat intake ratio was Q1 = 66.7:16.6:19.2, Q2 = 67.2:15.6:18.7, Q3 = 67.3:15.1:18.4 and Q4 = 67.3:14.0:17.9. The odds of elevated hs-CRP were 1.241 times higher in participants with the most proinflammatory diets than those with the most anti-inflammatory diets [hs-CRP; odds ratio (95% confidence interval) for Q4 vs Q1: 1.241 (1.071, 1.438);
