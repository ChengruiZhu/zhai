The anti-beta 2 leads to 6 fructosan antibodies sharing the idiotypes (Id) of ABPC48 (A48) monoclonal protein represent a silent fraction of the anti-beta 2 leads to 6 fructosan repertoire, since these antibodies cannot be detected during a conventional immune response elicited by bacterial levan (BL). However, the administration at birth of minute amounts of anti-A48 Id antibodies causes a long-lasting activation of A48 Id+-bearing clones. This activation is related to direct interaction of anti-A48 Id antibodies with precursors bearing the A48 Id+ immunoglobulin receptor, since an A48 Id+ response can be transferred with highly purified B cells in lethally irradiated mice. The maturation of these precursors into A48 Id+ anti-beta 2 leads to 6 fructosan antibody-secreting cells requires challenge by the antigen. Isoelectric focusing (IEF) data showed that in 1-mo-old mice an UPC10 (U10)-like spectrotype was observed, whereas in 3-mo-old mice, a new spectrotype binding BL rather than inulin (In) was identified. This spectrotype was observed only in CXBJ mice, the single strain in which an A48 Id+ response was observed. The antigenic challenge can be replaced by a monoclonal anti-A48 Id antibody (i.e., 17-38). Interestingly, in 1-mo-old BALB/c mice treated with anti-A48 Id antibodies, the challenge with 17-38 monoclonal antibody led to the activation of A48 Id- anti-beta 2 leads to 6 fructosan-reactive clones with BALB/c type IEF spectrotypes, whereas in 3-mo-old BALB/c mice treated with anti-A48 Id antibodies, the challenge with 17-38 monoclonal antibody led to the activation of W3082 IdX+ anti-beta 2 leads to 6 and beta 2 leads to 1 fructosan-reactive clones. In these animals, inhibition of A48 Id+ anti-beta 2 leads to 6 fructosan clones was observed. This antibody probably represents a homobody carrying the internal image of the antigen, which through its paratope suppresses the A48 Id+ response and through its Id activates an A48 Id- anti-beta 2 leads to 6 fructosan response in 1-mo-old mice and in 3-mo-old mice leads to an anti-beta 2 leads to 6 and beta 2 leads to 1 fructosan response dominated by the W3082 IdX.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)
