Doublecortin-like kinase 1 (DCLK1) has been found to be involved in malignant biological behavior of cancers and poor prognosis of cancer patients. The aim of this meta-analysis was to systematically clarify the relationships between expression level of DCLK1 and clinicopathological characteristics in tumors and assess its clinical value in cancer diagnosis and prognosis. 18 eligible studies with a total of 2660 patients were identified by searching the electronic bibliographic databases. Pooled results showed that DCLK1 was highly expressed in tissues from cancer patients compared to normal tissues (OR, 10.00), and overexpression of DCLK1 was significantly correlated with advanced clinical stage (OR, 2.48), positive lymph node metastasis (OR, 2.18), poorly differentiated cancers (OR, 1.83) and poor overall survival (HR, 2.15). The overall combined sensitivity and specificity for DCLK1 in distinguishing malignant tumors were 0.58 and 0.90, respectively. The mean diagnostic odds ratio was 12.70, and the corresponding area under the summary receiver operating characteristic curve was 0.78. In summary, our study indicated that DCLK1 could be a risk factor for development of malignant tumors and may serve as a promising diagnostic and prognostic biomarker for malignant tumors.
