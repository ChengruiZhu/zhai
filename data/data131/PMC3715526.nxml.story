Neural networks in the brain can classify objects as being the same thing regardless of the stimulus intensity, which is referred to as gain control. This intensity invariance occurs during pattern recognition in any sensory modality. We evaluate whether it is possible to design stable neural circuits made of excitatory and inhibitory neurons that are capable of controlling the internal representation of a stimulus using network properties alone. Gain control is important because if the activity gets out of control neurons can die or be damaged by hyper-excitation. It is known that one can control the internal representation by the saturating responses of neurons. However, we show that there also is a precise relationship of network parameters that can account for gain control regardless of the external stimulus without such saturation. The most important network parameters are the connections from the inhibitory population to the rest of the network. This is consistent with experimental findings. We also show that the connections from the excitatory to the inhibitory population do not play an important role in gain control, suggesting that they can be freed for encoding purposes without leaving the operating range of the network when levels of stimulation increase.
