Both investigated compounds reduced paw edema, mechanical and thermal hyperalgesia in the carrageenan-induced acute inflammation. Moreover, administration of the investigated compounds resulted in decreased granulocyte influx and attenuated nociceptive reaction in the zymosan-induced peritonitis model. In the same model of inflammation, the investigated compounds reduced vascular permeability; however, this effect was observed only after the highest applied dose. Furthermore, the test compounds had no impact on cell viability in the experiments on RAW 264.7 macrophages. In these cells, stimulated with LPS, the test compounds decreased reactive oxygen species (ROS) production. They increased the cellular concentration of cAMP and attenuated the production of inflammatory cytokines such as TNFα and IL-1β. All results were comparable to those obtained for the reference compound JNJ7777120 with the exception of the impact on NO production. Nevertheless, this effect was similar to that obtained for the other reference compound rolipram, which is a phosphodiesterase 4 (PDE 4) inhibitor. Further experiments revealed that both of the investigated compounds possessed relatively low affinity for histamine H
