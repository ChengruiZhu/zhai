Several intersecting host, vector, and environmental factors have led to a re-emergence of rickettsial diseases such as Mediterranean Spotted Fever (MSF), and Dermacentor spp.-borne necrosis-erythema lymphadenopathy (DEBONEL). Some rickettsiae produce diffuse endothelial infection and systemic microvascular leakage leading in some cases to high morbidity and mortality. Unfortunately, little is known about the molecular pathways triggered by these diseases in humans. We therefore analyzed how candidate cytokines co-occur across acutely-ill patients with either a localized (DEBONEL), or a systemic (MSF) form of rickettsiosis, using bipartite visual analytics. The results revealed a network core consisting of a small set of MSF patients exhibiting high expressions of cytokines implicated in microvascular leakage, endothelial repair, and pro-inflammatory immune responses, and a network periphery consisting of a mixture of MSF and DEBONEL patients with relatively lower overall cytokine expressions. These results provide evidence of pathways triggered by rickettsiae in humans, and a testable hypothesis for the mechanisms in a rickettsia-induced cytokine storm with the translational goal of identifying therapeutic targets.
