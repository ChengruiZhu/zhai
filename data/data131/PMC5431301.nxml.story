 test. Spearman's correlation analysis was used to study the association between the miR-335 and Rock1 expression. Survival curves were drawn using the Kaplan-Meier method. Univariate and multivariate analysis was performed using the Cox's proportional hazard regression model to allow the prognostic values to be assessed. Expression levels of miR-335 were significantly reduced in osteosarcoma tissues (P<0.001), compared with that in noncancerous bone tissues, while Rock1 expression was significantly increased in osteosarcoma tissues (P<0.001). A strong correlation between miR-335 and Rock1 expression was also shown (P<0.001). Decreased miR-335 expression was identified to be positively associated with higher clinical stage (P=0.004) and distant metastasis (P=0.016), while elevated expression levels of Rock1 was positively associated with a larger tumor size (P=0.013), higher clinical stage (P=0.027) and distant metastasis (P=0.022). The combined high expression of Rock1 and low expression of miR-335 was clearly associated with distant metastasis (P=0.010) and a higher clinical stage (P=0.010). Patients with elevated Rock1 or decreased miR-335 expression exhibited a worse overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS) compared with patients with decreased Rock1 or increased miR-335 (P<0.001 for the two). In addition, patients with decreased miR-335 and increased Rock1 had the worst OS and DFS (P<0.001 for the two). In multivariate survival analysis, clinical stage (P=0.002 for DFS, P=0.015 for OS), distant metastasis (P=0.024 for DFS, P=0.002 for OS), low expression of miR-335 (P<0.001 for DFS, P=0.002 for OS) and combined depressed miR-335 and elevated Rock1 (P=0.021 for DFS, P=0.050 for OS) expression remained as the independent prognostic factors for DFS and OS. The present findings suggest that there may be an association between the combined downregulation of miR-335 and upregulation of Rock1 with tumor progression and adverse prognosis in patients with osteosarcoma.
