Despite extensive research on cancer stem cells in colorectal cancer, the impact of stem cell markers on patient survival remains unclear, particularly in those with distant metastasis. In this study, we focused on colon cancer with peritoneal metastasis and investigated the association between the expression of CD133, aldehyde dehydrogenase-1 (ALDH1) and leucine-rich repeating G-protein coupled receptor-5 (Lgr5), and disease prognosis. Putative stem cell marker expression was immunohistochemically evaluated in samples from 142 primary tumours and 75 peritoneal nodules. The associations between the expression of these markers and clinicopathological characteristics, overall survival and disease-free survival were analysed. The expression of CD133, ALDH1 and Lgr5 was found to be positive in 55.6, 47.2 and 78.9% of the primary tumour samples, respectively. While their expression was not associated with overall survival, disease-free survival was significantly worse in the CD133-negative group (36.1 vs. 13.7%, P=0.041). Multivariable analysis confirmed that a negative CD133 expression was an independent risk factor for a reduced disease-free survival (P=0.005). Furthermore, the benefit of systemic chemotherapy was significantly greater in the CD133-negative group (P=0.039). On the whole, our data indicated that patients with colon cancer with CD133-negative expression had a reduced disease-free survival. Thus, we propose that CD133 expression may be a useful clinical biomarker in the treatment of colon cancer with peritoneal metastasis.
