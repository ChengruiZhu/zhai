Nanocarbons
show great promise for establishing the next generation of Joule heating
systems, but suffer from the limited maximum temperature due to precociously
convective heat dissipation from electrothermal system to surrounding
environment. Here we introduce a strategy to eliminate such convective
heat transfer by inserting highly stable and conductive microcapsules
into the electrothermal structures. The microcapsule is composed of
encapsulated long-chain alkanes and graphene oxide/carbon nanotube
hybrids as core and shell material, respectively. Multiform carbon
nanotubes in the microspheres stabilize the capsule shell to resist
volume-change-induced rupture during repeated heating/cooling process,
and meanwhile enhance the thermal conductance of encapsulated alkanes
which facilitates an expeditious heat exchange. The resulting microcapsules
can be homogeneously incorporated in the nanocarbon-based electrothermal
structures. At a dopant of 5%, the working temperature can be enhanced
by 30% even at a low voltage and moderate temperature, which indicates
a great value in daily household applications. Therefore, the stable
and conductive microcapsule may serve as a versatile and valuable
dopant for varieties of heat generation systems.
