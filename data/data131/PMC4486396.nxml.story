A 78-year-old man with hepatic dysfunction and cholestasis was referred to our hospital. Preoperative imaging studies revealed the presence of papillary tumors in the left hepatic duct and common hepatic duct, while no tumor lesions were detected in the right hepatic duct. This patient underwent left hepatectomy, extra-hepatic bile duct resection with biliary reconstruction, and regional lymphnode dissection. On the basis of pathological examination, this patient was diagnosed with multiple IPNB with early-stage adenocarcinoma with negative surgical margin. Postoperative work-up was periodically performed, indicating no evidence of recurrence, while the patient had sustained hepatic dysfunction, cholestasis, and repetitive cholangitis since the early postoperative period. Finally, recurrence in the remnant intrahepatic bile duct of the posterior segment was revealed by double balloon enteroscopy at 29 months after surgery. At 34 months after surgery, internal drainage stents were replaced in both endoscopic and percutaneous manners within the relapsed intrahepatic bile ducts to address repetitive cholangitis. These procedures enabled the patient to remain asymptomatic until death at 41 months after surgery.
