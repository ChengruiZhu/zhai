Hormesis is a highly controversial and poorly understood phenomenon. It describes the idea that an inhibitor molecule, like an anti-cancer or anti-microbial drug, can inadvertently stimulate cell growth instead of suppressing it. This can have a profound effect on human health leading to failures in clinical treatments. Therefore, getting at the mechanistic basis of hormesis is critical for drug development and clinical practice, however molecular mechanisms underpinning hormesis remain poorly understood. In this paper we use a mathematical model to propose a simple and yet general mechanism that could explain why we find hormesis so widely in living systems. In particular, we discover that hormesis is present within a fundamental structure that forms a basic building block of many intracellular signalling pathways found in diverse processes including control of cell reproduction and programmed cell death. The benefits of our study are two-fold. Having simple molecular understanding of the causes of hormetic responses can greatly improve the design of new drug compounds that avoid such responses. Moreover, due to the fundamental nature of the newly proposed mechanism, our findings have a potential broad applicability to both anti-cancer and anti-microbial drugs.
