Gene expression is controlled, in large part, by regulatory proteins called transcription factors that bind specific sites in the genome. A major focus of molecular biology has been understanding how these transcription factors interact with the cell's transcriptional machinery, the genome, and with each other to turn genes' expression on and off in various physiological contexts. Previous approaches for modeling transcriptional regulation have focused on the complex combinatorial interactions between groups of transcription factors at regulatory sites, or on the specific activating or repressive functions of individual proteins. In this work, we present a new modeling framework and demonstrate that an equally important, and previously overlooked, consideration in predicting the effect that a regulatory site has on gene expression is simply its location relative to the transcription start site of nearby genes. Our results show that, in general, the closer a binding event is to a gene's transcription start site, the more it influences expression. We also show that considering the particular proteins bound at a regulatory site helps predict the expression of nearby genes. However, considering the sequence conservation level of these sites does not lead to more accurate predictions.
