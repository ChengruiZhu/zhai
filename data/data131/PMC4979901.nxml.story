Electrical stimulation of the brain is increasingly used to alleviate the symptoms of a range of neurological disorders and as a means to artificially inject information into neural circuits in neuroprosthetic applications. Machine learning has been proposed to find optimal stimulation settings autonomously. However, this approach is impeded by the complexity of the interaction between the stimulus and the activity of the network, which makes it difficult to test how good the result actually is. We used phenomenological models of the interaction between stimulus and spontaneous activity in a neuronal network to design a testable machine learning challenge and evaluate the quality of the solution found by the algorithm. In this task, the learning algorithm had to find a solution that balances competing interdependencies of ongoing neuronal activity with opposing effects on the efficacy of stimulation. We show that machine learning can successfully solve this task and that the solutions found are close to the optimal settings to maximize the efficacy of stimulation. Since the paradigm involves several typical problems found in other settings, such concepts could help to formalize machine learning problems in more complex biological networks and to test the quality of their performance.
