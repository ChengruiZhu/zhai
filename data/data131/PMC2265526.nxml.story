It is widely believed that learning is due, at least in part, to modifications of synapses in the brain. The ability of a synapse to change its strength is called “synaptic plasticity,” and the rules governing these changes are a subject of intense research. Theoretical studies have shown that a particular family of synaptic plasticity rules, known as covariance rules, could underlie many forms of learning. While it is possible that a biological synapse would be able to approximately implement such abstract rules, it seems unlikely that this implementation would be exact. Covariance rules are inherently sensitive, and even a slight inaccuracy in their implementation is likely to result in substantial changes in synaptic strengths. Thus, the biological relevance of these rules remains questionable. Here we study the consequences of the mistuning of a covariance plasticity rule in the context of operant conditioning. In a previous study, we showed that an approximate phenomenological law of behavior called “the matching law” naturally emerges if synapses change according to the covariance rule. Here we show that although the effect of slight mistuning of the covariance rule on synaptic strengths is substantial, it leads to only small deviations from the matching law. Furthermore, these deviations are observed experimentally. Thus, our results support the hypothesis that covariance synaptic plasticity underlies operant conditioning.
