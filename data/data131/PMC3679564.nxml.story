Advances in endoscopic skull base (SB) surgery have led to the resection of increasingly larger cranial base lesions, resulting in large SB defects. These defects have initially led to increased postoperative cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) leaks. The development of the vascularized pedicled nasoseptal flap (PNSF) has successfully reduced postoperative CSF leaks. Mucocele formation, however, has been reported as a complication of this technique. In this study, we analyze the incidence of mucocele formation after repair of SB defects using a PNSF. A retrospective review was performed from December 2008 to December 2011 to identify patients who underwent PNSF reconstruction for large ventral SB defects. Demographic data, defect site, incidence of postoperative CSF leaks, and rate of mucocele formation were collected. Seventy patients undergoing PNSF repair of SB defects were identified. No postoperative mucocele formation was noted at an average radiological follow-up of 11.7 months (range, 3–36.9 months) and clinical follow-up of 13.8 months (range, 3–38.9 months), making the overall mucocele rate 0%. The postoperative CSF leak rate was 2.9%. Proper closure of SB defects is crucial to prevent CSF leaks. The PNSF is an efficient technique for these repairs. Although this flap may carry an inherent risk of mucocele formation when placed over mucosalized bone during repair, we found that meticulous and strategic removal of mucosa from the site of flap placement resulted in a 0% incidence of postoperative mucocele formation in our cohort.
