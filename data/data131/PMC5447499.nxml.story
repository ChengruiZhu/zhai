Clinical studies have identified traumatic brain injury (TBI) as a risk factor for the development of cocaine dependence. This claim is supported by our recent preclinical studies showing enhancement of the rewarding effects of cocaine in mice sustaining moderate controlled cortical impact (CCI) injury during adolescence. Here we test the efficacy of dexamethasone, an anti-inflammatory corticosteroid, to attenuate augmentation of the behavioral response to cocaine observed in CCI-TBI animals using the conditioned place preference (CPP) assay. These studies were performed in order to determine whether proinflammatory activity in the nucleus accumbens (NAc), a key brain nucleus in the reward pathway, mediates enhanced cocaine-induced CPP in adolescent animals sustaining moderate CCI-TBI. Our data reveal robust glial activation in the NAc following CCI-TBI and a significant increase in the cocaine-induced CPP of untreated CCI-TBI mice. Furthermore, our results show that dexamethasone treatment following CCI-TBI can attenuate the cocaine place preference of injured animals without producing aversion in the CPP assay. Our studies also found that dexamethasone treatment significantly reduced the expression of select immune response genes including Monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1/CCL2) and intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (
