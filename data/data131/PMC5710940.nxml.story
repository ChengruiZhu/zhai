Esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) is a deadly disease with high risk of tumor recurrence even among patients with an early pathologic stage of tumor. In the current study, we investigate the association between 20 SNPs of the ATG5 gene and prognosis of patients with early-stage ESCC. A total of 305 patients diagnosed with early-stage ESCC were enrolled in the study and randomly assigned to a training set (n=93) or replication set (n=212). The genotypes of candidate SNPs (single nucleotide polymorphisms) within ATG5 were analyzed and correlated with the prognosis of ESCC patients. We repeatedly demonstrated that 3 SNPs in ATG5, rs1322178, rs3804329, and rs671116, were significantly correlated with the prognosis of patients with early-stage ESCC (HR[95 % CI]=2.01[1.19-3.40], p=0.009 for ATG5: rs1322178; HR[95 % CI]=1.88 [1.08-3.26], p=0.025 for ATG5:rs3804329; HR[95 % CI]=1.73[1.24-2.42], p=0.001 for ATG5:rs671116, in combined group). Both rs1322178 and rs3804329 can predict early distant metastasis of patients. Furthermore, increased expression of ATG5 was observed in ESCC tumor tissue as compared to adjacent normal tissue. Moreover, higher levels of ATG5 expression in both normal and tumor tissues exhibited a trend to correlate with poor prognosis of patients. However, the expression of ATG5 did not correlate with these 3 relevant prognostic SNPs. We concluded that hereditary genetic polymorphisms and gene expression of
