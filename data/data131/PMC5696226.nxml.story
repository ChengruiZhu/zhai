Multiple myeloma (MM) is a malignant plasma disease closely associated with inflammation. In MM bone marrow microenvironment, bone marrow stromal cells (BMSCs) are the primary source of interleukin-6 (IL-6) secretion, which promotes the proliferation and progression of MM cells. However, it is still unknown how the microenvironment stimulates BMSCs to secrete IL-6. Interleukin-32 (IL-32) is a newly identified pro-inflammatory factor. It was reported that in solid tumors, IL-32 induces changes in other inflammatory factors including IL-6, IL-10, and TNF-α. The aim of this study was to investigate the expression of IL-32 and the role of IL-32 in the MM bone marrow microenvironment. Our data illustrate that MM patients have higher expression of IL-32 than healthy individuals in both bone marrow and peripheral blood. We used ELISA and qRT-PCR to find that malignant plasma cells are the primary source of IL-32 production in MM bone marrow. ELISA and Western blot analysis revealed that recombinant IL-32α induces production of IL-6 in BMSCs by activating NF-κB and STAT3 signaling pathways, konckdown of IL-32 receptor PR3 inhibit this process. Knockdown of IL-32 by shRNA decreased the proliferation in MM cells that induced by BMSCs. In conclusion, IL-32 secreted from MM cells has paracrine effect to induce production of IL-6 in BMSCs, thus feedback to promote MM cells growth.
