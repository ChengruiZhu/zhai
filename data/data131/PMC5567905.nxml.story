Oligodendrocytes are glial cells of the central nervous system. One of their major tasks is to enwrap neuronal axons with myelin, providing electrical insulation of axons and a dramatic increase in the speed of nerve impulse propagation. Oligodendrocytes develop from oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs). Self-renewal of OPCs, their differentiation into oligodendrocytes, and the process of myelin synthesis are influenced by neuronal activity. Furthermore, OPCs receive glutamatergic synaptic input from neurons. Neuronal activity in vivo is highly variable depending on the brain region, input stimulus, and/or behavioral task that an animal or human has to perform in everyday life. Therefore, it is important to understand whether different types of neuronal activity affect development and function of oligodendrocyte lineage cells in a distinct way. In this study, we demonstrate that the amount and the timing of glutamate release at synapses between neurons and OPCs, the properties of the subsequent ionic current through glutamate receptors in OPC membrane, as well as the extent of OPCsâ€™ self-renewal and differentiation into oligodendrocytes differ depending on the frequency and duration of neuronal activity. Hence, the pattern of neuronal activity rather than just presence or absence of activity is an important parameter that determines development and function of oligodendroglial cells.
