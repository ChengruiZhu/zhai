A total of 266 patients (78% males, median age 44 years, median CD4 603 cells/µL, 79% treated with a tenofovir-containing backbone) were enrolled. At the time of analysis, 24 weeks data were available for 84 and 87 patients in arm one and two, respectively. At baseline, subjects in the two arms did not differ for the main characteristics. At 24 weeks, at the intention to treat analysis the proportion of patients free of TF was 91.7% (95% CI 85.8–97.6) and 85.1% (95% CI 77.6–92.6) in arm one and two, respectively (difference +6.6%, 95% CI −2.9/+16.1). VF was observed in two patients randomized to arm one (one at baseline, before treatment simplification) and one to arm two without resistance mutations. Clinical and laboratory adverse events occurred at similar rates in the two arms. At week 24, patients in arm one showed a greater increase in CD4 (mean change +90 vs +10 cells/µL, p=0.007). A greater increase in total cholesterol (+18 vs −2 mg/dL, p<0.001), HDL (+4 vs +0 mg/dL, p=0.001) and LDL (+12 vs +0 mg/dL, p=0.001) was also observed in arm one without differences in other lipid parameters. Renal function showed a significant improvement in arm one (mean change in eGFR +5 vs −2 mL/min/1.73m
