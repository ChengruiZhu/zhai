Exercise training plays a major role in the improving physiology of diabetes. Herein we aimed to investigate the influence of exercise upon the calcium-dependent calpain-isoform expressions of lean or obese Zucker rats, a model of obesity and type II diabetes (NIDDM). Five-month-old rats were divided: (1) obese sedentary (OS, n=7); (2) obese exercise (OE, n=7); (3) lean sedentary (LS, n=7); (4) lean exercise (LE, n=7). After 2-month exercise (treadmill running), the body weight (BW) and expression of calpain 10, μ-calpain, and m-calpain in skeletal muscles were determined by RT-PCR, using β-actin as internal standard. We found exercise is useful for BW lossing, especially in the obese rats. The BW difference between OS and OE rats (69 g vs. 18.2 g) was more significantly than that between LS and LE rats (41.8 g vs. 28.7g). The calpain 10 expression of LS rats (0.965) was lower than that of LE rats (1.006), whereas those of OS and OE were comparable. The μ- or m-calpain expressions of sedentary groups (OS, LS) was significantly higher than those of exercise groups (OE, LE). The μ-calpain expression (1.13/0.92) and m-calpain expression (1.01/0.99) of OS/LS rats was significantly higher than those of OE/LE rats [1.07/0.9 (μ-calpain); 0.97/0.95 (m-calpain)]. We concluded that the μ- or m-calpains in skeletal muscle are regulated by exercise in both lean and obese Zucker rats. Exercise and BW controlling might improve the physiopathology of obesity and diabetes. Both μ- or m-calpains might become useful markers for prognoses of diabetes.
