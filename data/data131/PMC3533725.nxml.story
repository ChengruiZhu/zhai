We evaluated eleven biomarkers in 105 unrelated patients during their hospitalization after acute stroke event. Our data indicate a significant association of: a) confluent IL size with 4th quartile of Erythrocyte Sedimentation Rate (ESR) (OR = 5.250; 95% CI, 1.002 to 27.514) and an independent correlation with sex; b) confluent IL size with 3rd quartile of fibrinogen (OR = 5.5; 95% CI, 1.027 to 29.451); c) confluent IL size with 3rd quartile of platelets (OR= 0.059; 95% CI, 0.003 to 1.175) and independent correlation with sex; d) smaller IL size (OR = 5.25; 95% CI, 1.351 to 20.396) with 3rd quartile of albumin levels and nodular and parenchimal IL size with 2nd (OR = 0.227; 95% CI, 0.053 to 0.981), 3rd (OR = 0.164; 95% CI, 0.038 to 0.711) and 4th (OR = 0.205; 95% CI, 0.048 to 0.870) quartiles albumin levels; e) smaller IL size with 3rd quartile triglycerides (TG) levels (OR = 9; 95% CI, 2.487 to 32.567) and an independent correlation with anterior location. Smaller IL size, anterior AIS turned out to be independently correlated with high serum albumin levels. Finally, high INR and PTT values were associated with worse NIHSS clinical outcomes in contrast to that observed with higher albumin level.
