Patients affected by vestibular schwannomas typically report a number of symptoms and minor disabilities after surgery. Therefore, surgeons dealing with this pathology should also try to achieve a good QoL for patients who have undergone tumour removal. The aim of this study was to analyse QoL in subjects undergoing surgery for vestibular schwannomas and to try to establish a relationship with both the tumour size and post-surgical alterations (e.g. facial motor dysfunctions, difficulties in balance, persistence of headache and tinnitus). A retrospective analysis was performed on a consecutive series of 81 patients affected by vestibular schwannomas and treated by a combined microscopic-endoscopic approach. Three groups of patients were identified on the basis of tumour size. Group 1 (lesions < 25 mm) with 31 patients (38%); Group 2 (lesions > 26 mm and < 40 mm) with 39 patients (48%); Group 3 (lesions > 41 mm) with 11 patients (14%). Data obtained with the Short Form Questionnaire showed a statistically significant difference in QoL in those undergoing intervention compared with a control group of healthy subjects. The Glasgow Benefit Inventory Questionnaire showed that 25 (31%) patients felt better, 11 (14%) felt similarly, and 45 (55%) felt poorer health conditions in comparison to the pre-surgical period. Concerning the relationship between preservation of facial nerve function and QoL, using the Glasgow Health Status Inventory, it appeared that only 34% of subjects with good facial nerve function (RGS grade I-II) complained of worsening of QoL, while 45% of those with serious facial nerve injury (RGS grade IV-V) referred poorer QoL. Moreover, the possibility of recovery of facial nerve function during the months following surgery was clearly highlighted by our analysis. Our study confirmed the close relation between tumour size and post-surgical QoL, which is worse for patients affected by larger lesions.
