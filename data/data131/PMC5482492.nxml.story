Lipids are main sources of energy for liver and cardiac and skeletal muscle. Mitochondria are the main site of lipid oxidation which, in the heart, supplies most of the energy required for its blood pumping function. Paradoxically, however, lipids over supply impair mitochondrial function leading to metabolic syndrome, insulin resistance and diabetes. In this context, scientific debate centers on the impact of lipids and mitochondrial function on diverse aspects of human health, nutrition and disease. To elucidate the underlying mechanisms of this issue, while accounting for both the fundamental role of lipids as energy source as well as their potential detrimental effects, we utilized a combined experimental and computational approach. Our mitochondrial computational model includes Î²-oxidation, the main route of lipid degradation, among other pathways that include oxygen radical generation and consumption. Studies were performed in heart mitochondria from type 1 diabetic and control guinea pigs. Model and experimental results show that, below a concentration threshold, lipids fueling proceeds without disrupting mitochondrial function; above threshold, lipids uncouple mitochondrial respiration triggering excess emission of oxidants while impairing antioxidant systems and the mitochondrial energy supply-demand response. These contributions are of direct use for interpreting and predicting functional impairments in metabolic disorders associated with increased circulating levels of lipids and metabolic alterations in their utilization, storage and intracellular signaling.
