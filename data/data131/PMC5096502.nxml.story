Ovotesticular disorder of sexual development (DSD), formerly known as true hermaphroditism, is a rare form of DSD in which both testicular and ovarian tissues are present in the same individual either in a single gonad (ovotestis) or in opposite gonads with a testis and an ovary on each side. The diagnosis of ovotesticular DSD is based solely on the presence of ovarian and testicular tissue in the gonad and not on the characteristics of the internal and external genitalia, even if ambiguous. Herein, we report two patients with ovotesticular DSD-one presenting with ambiguous genitalia on the third day after birth and the other with short stature and primary amenorrhea in adolescence. Clinical and histopathological investigation revealed a sex-determining region on the Y chromosome (SRY)-positive 46,XX karyotype and bilateral ovotestes in case 1 and a 46,XY karyotype with hypergonadotropic hypogonadism and a streak gonad in one ovotestis with dysgerminoma, gonadoblastoma, and papillary tubal hyperplasia in the contralateral ovotestis in case 2. Laparoscopic examination and gonadal biopsy for histopathological diagnosis remain the cornerstones for a diagnosis of ovotesticular DSD. Moreover, SRY positivity in a 46,XX patient, a 46,XY karyotype, an intra-abdominal gonad, and the age of patient at the time of diagnosis are predictive risk factors for the development of gonadoblastoma and/or dysgerminoma in ovotesticular DSD.
