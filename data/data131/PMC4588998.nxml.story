27 patients (24 males, 3 females) met inclusion criteria for the PI group (9 CNP and 18 PNP). Treatment for CNP included an AFO for all patients, non-operative (1), neurolysis (2), tendon transfer (3), nerve transfer (1), and combined nerve/tendon transfer (1). One patient in the CNP group required additional surgery, undergoing below knee amputation. Treatment for PNP included non-op (12), neurolysis (4), nerve transfer (1), and combined nerve/tendon transfer (1). 2 patients with incomplete nerve palsy required additional surgery, undergoing an arthrodesis and a total knee arthroplasty. 3 CNP (37.5%) and 15 PNP (83.3%) regained 3/5 or greater tibialis anterior (TA) strength. PNP was associated with increased recovery of 3/5 extensor hallucis longus (EHL) strength (p=0.0093). Outcome scores were obtained for 17 of the remaining patients at a mean 6.6 (range 2-18) years. Univariate analysis revealed no difference between the CNP and PNP groups. Final motor grade of 3/5 did not predict improved outcomes. Not undergoing a tendon transfer procedure predicted better outcomes on the IKDC score (70.5 vs 45.0; p=0.027). All other peroneal nerve interventions were not associated with improved motor or functional outcome. 20 patients formed the NI group. The PI and NI groups were matched on gender (18 M, 2 F), age (mean 30.8 vs 29.5 years), and Modified Schenck Classification (2 KD-I, 10 KD-IIIL, 5 KD-IV, 3 KD-V vs 2, 7, 8, and 3 respectively). In univariate analysis, the PI group had inferior outcomes on both the IKDC (64.5 vs 77.3; p=0.036) and Lysholm (67.1 vs 83.0; p=0.023) scores.
