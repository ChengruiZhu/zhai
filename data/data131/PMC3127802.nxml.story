The hippocampus is a part of the cerebral cortex involved in formation of certain types of long term memories. Activity-dependent change in the strength of neuronal connections in the hippocampus, known as synaptic plasticity, is one mechanism used to store memories. The ability to form crisp and distinguishable memories of different events implies that learning produces plasticity of specific and distinct subsets of synapses within each neuron. Synaptic activity leads to production of intracellular signaling molecules, which ultimately cause changes in the properties of the synapses. The requirement for synaptic specificity seems incompatible with the diffusibility of intracellular signaling molecules. Anchoring proteins restrict signaling molecules to particular subcellular compartments thereby combating the indiscriminate spread of intracellular signaling molecules. To investigate whether the critical function of anchoring proteins is to localize proteins near their activators or their targets, we developed a stochastic reaction-diffusion model of signaling pathways leading to synaptic plasticity in hippocampal neurons. Simulations demonstrate that colocalizing proteins with their activator molecules is more important due to inactivation mechanisms that limit the spatial extent of the activator molecules.
