Both group 1 and group 2 had a median OS of 13 months. The patient median age for the 115 group 1 patients versus the 35 group 2 patients was 62 versus 56 years. Group 1 had slightly more males and group 2, females. The predominant ECOG score for each group was 1 and the number of ECD sites was one and two, respectively. Uncontrolled ECD occurred in the majority of both group 1 and group 2 patients. The main COD was ECD in both groups. The prevalent tumor histology for groups 1 and 2 was non-small cell lung carcinoma. Median TVs were 1.08 cc versus 1.42 cc for groups 1 and 2, respectively. The majority of patients in both groups did not undergo post-CKRS WBRT. Imaging outcomes were LC (CR, PR, or stable imaging) in 93 (80.9%) and 26 (74.3%) group 1 and 2 patients, of whom 32 (27.8%) and six (17.1%) had CR; 38 (33.0%) and 18 (51.4%), PR and 23 (20.0%) and two (5.7%), stable imaging; LF was the outcome in 22 (19.1%) and nine (25.7%) patients, and DBF occurred in 62 (53.9%) and 21 (60.0%), respectively. Uni- and multivariable analyses showed the independent parameters of a lower ECOG score, a greater number of ECD sites and uncontrolled ECD were significantly associated with greater mortality risk with and without accounting for other covariates. At CKRS, 19 group 1 and 2 CR patients had a mean ANC of 5.88 K/µL and a mean ALC of 1.31 K/µL and 13 (68%) of 19 had NLRs ≤ five, while 11 with LFs had a mean ANC of 5.22 K/µL and a mean ALC of 0.93 K/µL and seven (64%) had NLRs > five. An NLR ≤ five and high ALC was associated with a CR and an NLR > five and a low ALC with an LF.
