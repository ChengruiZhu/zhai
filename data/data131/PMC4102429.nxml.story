Some fungi have become pathogenic to plants and in a lesser extent to animals. Under certain conditions their presence in the human body can prove a threat for human health, especially for immunocompromised patients. Yet, some fungi can also infect healthy individuals. The low sensitivity of the antifungal drugs available together with the clinically observed resistance of some fungi raises the demand for new alternative treatments. Proteins are biological molecules which perform essential functions within the living organisms. Many of those functions are attributed to the varying folded structure of each protein. These configurations are composed of functional units -also called domains- each one independently responsible for a fraction of the overall biological function. Understanding how the different block combinations are distributed across members of the same or similar families of organisms is important. For instance, exclusive domain combinations can hold particular acquired functions. Blocks displaying a high mobility can play major roles for the organism's survival. The biological goal of this study was to analyse the functional implications of protein domains and domain combinations in the available fungal proteomes. This information can be used to highlight proteins and pathways that could be potentially used as drug targets.
