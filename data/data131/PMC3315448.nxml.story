Brain activity is increasingly characterized by patterns of pair-wise correlations (large-scale functional connectivity) across the whole brain obtained from Blood Oxygen Level Dependent (BOLD) functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Typically this is done during resting states (i.e. no presented stimulus) to differentiate subjects based on individual variation or diagnosis. In the current work, we identify such patterns that are a sensitive signature of unattended processing of threat-related stimuli, allowing one to “brain-read” whether an individual was presented with a neutral or fearful face while they attended to non-expression-related stimulus features. These results further the understanding of the neural mechanisms sub-serving threat-detection and facial affect processing in healthy subjects, and may also help further our understanding of various disorders, such as anxiety and autism, which exhibit anomalies in these processes. At the same time, we propose an exploratory and sensitive approach for the identification of condition-dependent, large-scale functional connectivity. This approach is not based on statistical inference on functional connections averaged across subjects and contrasted between two conditions, but rather based on the informative contribution of each functional connection when attempting to predict between two conditions, using machine-learning based multivariate pattern analysis on training data from separate subjects.
