Sodium channels are the key proteins for action potential firing in most excitable cells. Inhibitor drugs prevent excitation (local anesthetics), regulate excitability (antiarrhythmics), or prevent overexcitation (antiepileptic, antispastic and neuroprotective drugs) by binding to the channel and keeping it in one of the inactivated channel conformations. Sodium channels have one fast- and several slow-inactivated conformations (states). The specific stabilization of slow-inactivated states have been proposed to be advantageous in certain therapeutic applications. The question of whether individual drugs stabilize the fast or the slow-inactivated state is studied using specific voltage protocols. We tested the reliability of conclusions based on these protocols in simulation experiments using a model of sodium channels, and we found that fast- and slow-inactivated state-stabilizing drugs could not be differentiated. We suggested a method by which the state preference of at least a subset of individual drugs could be determined and tried the method in electrophysiology experiments with five individual drugs. Three of the drugs (lidocaine, phenytoin and carbamazepine) were classified as fast-inactivated state-stabilizers, while the state preference of fluoxetine and desipramine was found to be undeterminable by this method.
