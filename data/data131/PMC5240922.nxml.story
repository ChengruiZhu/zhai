The diversity of allosteric mechanisms in the Hsp70 proteins could range from modulation of the inter-domain interactions and conformational dynamics to fine-tuning of the Hsp70 interactions with co-chaperones. The goal of this study is to present a systematic computational analysis of the dynamic and evolutionary factors underlying allosteric structural transformations of the Hsp70 proteins. We investigated the relationship between functional dynamics, residue coevolution, and network organization of residue interactions in the Hsp70 proteins. The results of this study revealed that conformational dynamics of the Hsp70 proteins may be linked with coevolutionary propensities and mutual information dependencies of the protein residues. Modularity and connectivity of allosteric interactions in the Hsp70 chaperones are coordinated by stable functional sites that feature unique coevolutionary signatures and high network centrality. The emergence of the inter-domain communities that are coordinated by functional centers and include highly coevolving residues could facilitate structural transitions through cooperative reorganization of the local interacting modules. We determined that the differences in the modularity of the residue interactions and organization of coevolutionary networks in DnaK may be associated with variations in their allosteric mechanisms. The network signatures of the DnaK structures are characteristic of a population-shift allostery that allows for coordinated structural rearrangements of local communities. A dislocation of mediating centers and insufficient coevolutionary coupling between functional regions may render a reduced cooperativity and promote a limited entropy-driven allostery in the Sse1 chaperone that occurs without structural changes. The results of this study showed that a network-centric framework and a community-hopping model of allosteric communication pathways may provide novel insights into molecular and evolutionary principles of allosteric regulation in the Hsp70 proteins.
