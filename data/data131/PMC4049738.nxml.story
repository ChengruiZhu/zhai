MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small non-coding RNAs that regulate the expression of their target genes at the post-transcriptional level. In cancer cells, miRNAs, depending on the biological functions of their target genes, may have a tumor-promoting or -suppressing effect. Treatment of cancer cells with inhibitors of DNA methylation and/or histone deacetylation modulates the expression level of miRNAs, which provides evidence for epigenetic regulation of miRNA expression. The consequences of inhibition of histone methyltransferase on miRNA expression, however, have not been thoroughly investigated. The present study examined the expression pattern of miRNAs in the non-small cell lung cancer cell line, H1299 with or without treatment of BIX01294, a potent chemical inhibitor of G9a methyltransferase that catalyzes the mono-and di-methylation of the lysine 9 residue of histone H3. By coupling microarray analysis with quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction analysis, two miRNAs were identified that showed consistent downregulation following BIX01294 treatment. The results indicate that histone H3 methylation regulates miRNA expression in lung cancer cells, which may provide additional insight for future chemical treatment of lung cancer.
