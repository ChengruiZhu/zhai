FDG-PET) examination revealed obvious reduction of tumor FDG uptake. Transarterial tumor embolization (TAE) was performed for the previously unresectable right subphrenic liver tumor, and the other tumors were surgically resected. The resected tumors were diagnosed as liver metastases and a local recurrence of SPT in the postoperative pathological examination, which revealed that the resected tumors were composed of sheets of bland cells, which were positive for CD10, CD56, vimentin, neuron-specific enolase and Î±-antitrypsin. The postoperative course was uneventful, and the patient is currently under observation at an outpatient clinic; postoperative adjuvant chemotherapy with oral S-1 has continued, and additional TAE is planned. In the future, if the middle segment of the liver becomes enlarged, surgery for the residual right lobe tumor may be possible. This case demonstrates one method of SPT treatment: Preoperative HAI chemotherapy with GEM, plus oral S-1 and TAE. If complete resection can be achieved, the majority of patients with SPT have a favorable prognosis. In patients with unresectable metastases from SPT, it is crucial to conduct systematic multimodal treatment to maximize treatment success.
