Lung cancer screening provides an opportunity for smoking cessation interventions. A review of the literature found that smokers who participated in lung cancer screening had a higher smoking cessation rate compared with smokers in the general population. However, the randomized controlled trials included in the review did not identify any difference in smoking cessation rates between the individuals who had a CT scan to screen for lung cancer and unscreened control groups. Multiple studies observed participants for lengths of time ranging from 1 to 36 months and concluded that individuals who received abnormal CT results had a higher smoking cessation rate compared with participants with normal CT results. A single study that observed participants for 6 years initially found similar increased cessation rates among those with abnormal CT results, but at the conclusion of the study the difference in cessation rates had dissipated. Lung cancer screening produces a teachable moment when individuals may be more receptive to smoking cessation interventions. Advanced practitioners should take an active role in promoting smoking cessation interventions and fostering this teachable moment created by lung cancer screening.
