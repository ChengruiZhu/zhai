When active, the enzyme cyclin B1–cyclin-dependent kinase 1 (Cdk1) commits a growing cell to the process of mitotic cell division and chromosome separation. Cyclin B1–Cdk1 activation is controlled in many ways, but once its activity rises above a certain level, further activation of cyclin B1–Cdk1 is catalyzed by a positive-feedback loop. This generates highly active cyclin B1–Cdk1 and triggers the start of mitosis, which can only be completed when cyclin B1–Cdk1 activity is properly shut off again. However, it is not clear how cyclin B1–Cdk1 activity develops in human cells or how the switch between its inactive and active states is controlled. Our work combines activation measurements with a kinetic model to study how cyclin B1–Cdk1 activity accumulates just before and during mitosis. We show that cyclin B1–Cdk1 activity develops gradually in early mitosis and that different activity levels are required for initiation of, and progression through, mitosis. We also demonstrate that once cyclin B1–Cdk1 activation is truly launched, it is bound to continue and will not lightly drop back again. We propose that the successive cyclin B1–Cdk1 activity levels by themselves may coordinate the progression through the distinct phases of mitosis.
