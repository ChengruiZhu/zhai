 mRNA was markedly increased in these cells in a time-dependent manner. RANKL protein expression was also significantly enhanced in osteogenic-conditioned media from hPDCs undergoing osteoblastic differentiation. We then isolated and cultured CD34+ hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) from umbilical cord blood (UCB) mononuclear cells (MNCs) and found that these cells were well differentiated into several hematopoietic lineages. Finally, we co-cultured human trabecular bone osteoblasts (hOBs) with CD34+ HSCs and used the conditioned medium, collected from hPDCs during osteoblastic differentiation, to investigate whether factors produced during osteoblast maturation can affect osteoclast differentiation. Specifically, we measured the effect of this osteogenic-conditioned media on expression of osteoclastogenic markers and osteoclast cell number. We found that osteoclastic marker gene expression was highest in co-cultures incubated with the conditioned medium collected from hPDCs with the greatest level of osteogenic maturation. Although further study will be needed to clarify the precise mechanisms that underlie osteogenic-conditioned medium-regulated osteoclastogenesis, our results suggest that the osteogenic maturation of hPDCs could promote osteoclastic potential
