Fibrillar collagens are major components of connective tissue extracellular matrix (ECM). Among them, type I collagen is the most abundant protein in the human body and a large constituent of bone, dermis, tendon and ligament ECMs; type I collagen is also present in the stroma of other organs including heart, lung and kidney where, when dysregulated, it significantly contributes to pathological fibrosis. Type I and other collagen molecules have triple-helical folding requirements and undergo numerous intracellular post-translational modifications in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and Golgi apparatus. We and others have shown that alterations/loss of specific collagen modifications can lead to severe congenital disease such as osteogenesis imperfecta (OI). Here, using a multidisciplinary approach, we describe functional studies of the SC65 protein (Synaptonemal Complex 65 or P3H4), a poorly characterized member of the Leprecan gene family of proteins. We provide evidence that SC65 is a critical component of an ER complex with prolyl 3-hydroxylase 3 (P3H3), lysyl-hydroxylase 1 (LH1), and potentially cyclophilin B (CYPB). Loss of Sc65 in the mouse results in instability of this complex, site-specific reduction in collagen lysine hydroxylation and connective tissue defects including osteopenia and skin fragility.
