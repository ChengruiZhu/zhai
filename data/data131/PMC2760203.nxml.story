In organisms where females have two X chromosomes and males only have one, a mechanism called dosage compensation ensures that both sexes receive the same amount of information from their X chromosomes. Disruption of dosage compensation leads to lethality in the affected sex. While the precise mechanisms of dosage compensation differ between organisms, changes to the structure of the X chromosomes are involved in each case. The DNA of all chromosomes is packaged into a complex proteinâ€“DNA structure called chromatin. The most basic level of packaging involves wrapping DNA around a group of small proteins called histones. In both mammals and flies, dosage compensation is associated with specific changes to the histones on the dosage compensated X chromosome. Until now, no such change has been associated with dosage compensation in worms. Here we present evidence that the histone variant HTZ-1/H2A.Z plays a role in dosage compensation in the worm. Specifically, we suggest that HTZ-1 functions to ensure that only the X chromosomes, and not the other chromosomes, are subjected to dosage compensation. This suggests that, despite different mechanisms, one common theme of dosage compensation is a change at the level of the histones associated with the chromosomal DNA.
