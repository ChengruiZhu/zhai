Image‐guided radiation therapy delivery may be used to assess the position of the tumor and anatomical structures within the body as opposed to relying on external marks. The purpose of this manuscript is to evaluate the performance of the image registration software for automatically detecting and repositioning a 3D offset of a phantom using a kilovoltage onboard imaging system. Verification tests were performed on both a geometric rigid phantom and an anthropomorphic head phantom containing a humanoid skeleton to assess the precision and accuracy of the automated positioning system. From the translation only studies, the average deviation between the detected and known offset was less than 0.75 mm for each of the three principal directions, and the shifts did not show any directional sensitivity. The results are given as the measurement with standard deviation in parentheses. The combined translations and rotations had the greatest average deviation in the lateral, longitudinal, and vertical directions. For all dimensions, the magnitude of the deviation does not appear to be correlated with the magnitude of the actual translation introduced. The On‐Board Imager™ (OBI) system has been successfully integrated into a feasible online radiotherapy treatment guidance procedure. Evaluation of each patient's resulting automatch should be performed by therapists before each treatment session for adequate clinical oversight.
