Identification of the origin of the central retinal artery (CRA) is imperative in tailoring angiographic studies to resolve a given clinical problem. A case with dual ophthalmic arteries (OAs), characterized by different origins and distinct branching patterns, is documented for training purposes. Pre-clinical diagnosis of a 9-year-old child who presented with a sharp wire in the left-side eyeball was primarily corneal laceration. For imaging, a selected six-vessel angiographic study with the transfemoral approach was performed. Embolization was not required and the wire could be successfully removed. Right-side OA anatomy was normal, while left-side dual OAs with external carotid artery (ECA) and internal carotid artery (ICA) origins were seen. The case presented with a left-side meningo-ophthalmic artery (M-OA) anomaly via the ECA, marked by a middle meningeal artery (MMA) (origin: Maxillary artery; course: Through foramen spinosum) with normal branches (i.e. anterior and posterior branches), and an OA variant (course: Through superior orbital fissure) with a distinct orbital branching pattern. A smaller OA (origin: ICA; course: Through optic foramen) with a distinct ocular branching pattern presented with the central retinal artery (CRA). The presence of the dual OAs and the M-OA anomaly can be explained by disturbed evolutionary changes of the primitive OA and stapedial artery during development. The surgical interventionist must be aware of dual OAs and M-OA anomalies with branching pattern variations on retinal supply, because of dangerous extracranialâ€“intracranial anastomotic connections. It is of clinical significance that the origin of the CRA from the ICA or ECA must be determined to avoid complications to the vision.
