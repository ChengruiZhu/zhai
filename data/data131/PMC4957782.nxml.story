By maintaining the volume and composition of the body fluids within narrow ranges, and by producing a set of hormones that affect the blood vessels, the kidneys provide important long-term regulation of blood pressure. Disturbances of kidney function can cause hypertension, a prevalent disease in modern societies. The kidneys protect their own function against short-term variations in blood pressure at the level of the individual unit (the nephron). In recent years, it has become clear that there is an interaction between nephrons, and that this interaction is mediated through the arterial network of the kidney. The renal vacular network has a complex topology, and at present there are no computational models of this topology, precluding a computational assessment of the consequences of nephron-nephron interactions for renal blood flow control. In this work we focus on understanding how kidney specific vascular structure affects blood flow patterns and nephron-to-nephron interaction in kidney. The paper presents an approach to constructing realistic models of the renal vascular architecture. We developed a computational approach to reproduce the architecture and to examine its consequences for the operating regime of the nephrons.
