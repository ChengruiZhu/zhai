Maintenance of genome stability from generation to generation is a primary defense against mutation and ensuing disease. Thus, the cell has evolved complex mechanisms, consisting of redundant, partially overlapping pathways, to protect the fidelity of genome inheritance. Using modern genetic screening techniques that allow one to investigate every gene in yeast that might be involved in these pathways, the researchers have defined a network consisting of 322 genes that together safeguard the DNA replication process. Previous approaches were limited to defining the interaction of one or a few genes, but the availability of mutants affecting all of the nonessential yeast genes allowed the identification of over 800 interactions in this study. In addition, the synthetic genetic array technique used in this study allowed identification of every nonessential gene in yeast that interacts with an essential replication protein, Dna2p. The comprehensiveness of the approach identified most, if not all, of the pathways in which the multitasking Dna2p participates, in a single experiment. The genomic scale of the study significantly accelerates understanding of this protein over traditional, low-throughput genetic methods.
