, the pork tapeworm, is a major cause of epilepsy in developing countries. Although it has been deemed a potentially eradicable pathogen, it remains prevalent in rural communities. This two-part study aims to evaluate the utility of three microsatellite markers previously reported, to identify parasites and to establish relationships among them. In the first study, we evaluated the genetic variability of the progeny of two individual tapeworms by infecting two groups of three pigs each. We found variation of 8% and 0% in the two groups with respect to the parental tapeworm, indicating that the cysts source may be identifiable. Next, in the second study we described the genetic relationships among tapeworms obtained from four carriers and cysts obtained from eight naturally infected pigs in a rural community. We demonstrated that pigs can have two types of cysts, suggesting multiple infections. In addition, we found relatedness between 6 pigs and one tapeworm identified in the community. Our results indicate the potential for microsatellite markers to identify genetic relationships between parasites and thereby establish routes of transmission. It is likely that the limited number of microsatellites prevented us from establishing relatedness with more precision. Therefore, further evaluation of additional microsatellites is recommended.
