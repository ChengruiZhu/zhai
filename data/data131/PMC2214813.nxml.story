How do neuronal populations in the auditory cortex represent sounds? Although sound-evoked neural responses in the anesthetized auditory cortex are mainly transient, recent experiments in the unanesthetized preparation have emphasized subpopulations with other response properties. We quantified the relative contributions of these different subpopulations in the auditory cortex of awake head-fixed rats. We recorded neuronal activity using cell-attached recordings with a glass electrode—a method for which isolation of individual neurons does not depend on neuronal activity—while probing neurons with a representative ensemble of sounds. Our data therefore address the question: What is the typical response to a particular stimulus? We find that the population response is sparse, with sounds typically eliciting high activity in less than 5% of neurons at any instant. The overall population response was well described by a lognormal distribution, rather than the exponential distribution that is often reported. Our results represent, to our knowledge, the first quantitative evidence for sparse representations of sounds in the unanesthetized auditory cortex. These results are compatible with a model in which most neurons are silent much of the time, and in which representations are composed of small dynamic subsets of highly active neurons.
