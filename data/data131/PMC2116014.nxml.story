Bovine aortic endothelial cells (BAEC), grown in vitro, are shown to synthesize and secrete factor(s) that stimulate fibroblasts to contract collagen matrices. The amount of contraction-promoting activity in the conditioned media is dependent on conditioning time and the number of cells in the culture. Production of the contraction-promoting activity continues at a high stable level for at least 5 d in serum-free medium but is abolished when the cells are exposed to an inhibitor of protein synthesis. The mechanism of action of the contraction factor(s) derived from endothelial cells was compared with that of unidentified serum factors. The endothelial cell-secreted factor(s) depends on active protein synthesis by the target cell but does not need to be present during the contraction process. The serum factors on the other hand promote collagen contraction in the absence of de novo protein synthesis but need to be continuously present. Preliminary biochemical characterization of the contraction-promoting factors produced by endothelial cells revealed properties similar to those of previously identified growth factors. However, the BAEC-secreted factor was found to be distinct from a previously identified contraction-promoting transforming growth factor beta.
