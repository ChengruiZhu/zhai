Methods such as electron microscopy and electrophysiology led to the understanding that gap junctions were dense arrays of channels connecting the intracellular environments within almost all animal tissues. The characteristics of gap junctions were remarkably similar in preparations from phylogenetically diverse animals such as cnidarians and chordates. Although few studies directly compared them, minor differences were noted between gap junctions of vertebrates and invertebrates. For instance, a slightly wider gap was noted between cells of invertebrates and the spacing between invertebrate channels was generally greater. Connexins were identified as the structural component of vertebrate junctions in the 1980s and innexins as the structural component of pre‐chordate junctions in the 1990s. Despite a lack of similarity in gene sequence, connexins and innexins are remarkably similar. Innexins and connexins have the same membrane topology and form intercellular channels that play a variety of tissue‐ and temporally specific roles. Both protein types oligomerize to form large aqueous channels that allow the passage of ions and small metabolites and are regulated by factors such as pH, calcium, and voltage. Much more is currently known about the structure, function, and structure–function relationships of connexins. However, the innexin field is expanding. Greater knowledge of innexin channels will permit more detailed comparisons with their connexin‐based counterparts, and provide insight into the ubiquitous yet specific roles of gap junctions. © 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.
