Caveolin-1 is an integral membrane protein of caveolae that is thought to play an important role in both the traffic of cholesterol to caveolae and modulating the activity of multiple signaling molecules at this site. The molecule is synthesized in the endoplasmic reticulum, transported to the cell surface, and undergoes a poorly understood recycling itinerary. We have used mutagenesis to determine the parts of the molecule that control traffic of caveolin-1 from its site of synthesis to the cell surface. We identified four regions of the molecule that appear to influence caveolin-1 traffic. A region between amino acids 66 and 70, which is in the most conserved region of the molecule, is necessary for exit from the endoplasmic reticulum. The region between amino acids 71 and 80 controls incorporation of caveolin-1 oligomers into detergent-resistant regions of the Golgi apparatus. Amino acids 91–100 and 134–154 both control oligomerization and exit from the Golgi apparatus. Removal of other portions of the molecule has no effect on targeting of newly synthesized caveolin-1 to caveolae. The results suggest that movement of caveolin-1 among various endomembrane compartments is controlled at multiple steps.
