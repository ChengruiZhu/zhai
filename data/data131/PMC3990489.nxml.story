Oseltamivir is currently the most commonly used drug against influenza but the emergence and spread of oseltamivir-resistant virus is threatening its usefulness. A previously published study quantified the risk of drug-resistance emergence and spread. In this work we investigate under what conditions drug-resistance is likely to occur and how we can mitigate it. For this purpose, we simulated populations of influenza-infected subjects under different treatment conditions varying drug dose, intake frequency and duration of therapy. We used an approach that mimics the randomness of drug-resistance emergence and allowed for between-subject variability. We measured the effect of treatment on reducing infection and symptoms and on drug-resistance emergence. We found that for subjects starting oseltamivir during the influenza incubation period, the risk of resistance emergence is dramatically increased. Thus, our findings suggest that standard prophylaxis should only be used after exclusion of an influenza infection in the incubation period by use of a rapid test. If existing infection cannot be excluded, then prophylaxis should be done with increased dose, intake frequency and duration in order to avoid emergence of drug-resistant strains and to preserve oseltamivir efficacy.
