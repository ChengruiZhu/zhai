Variability is inherent in biological systems, and in order to understand them, we need to be able to model different sources of variability. Systems have evolved to harness and control the variability, and more recently, synthetic biologists are trying to learn how to control variability in engineered biological systems. Several sources of variability exist; they arise due to stochastic expression of genes, which is most pronounced when numbers of mRNA and protein molecules are low, as well as due to differences between individual cells. Here we propose a modeling framework that combines different sources of biological variability. Furthermore, current research seeks to control biological variability though robust design of synthetic biological circuits, for example for use in therapies and other biomedical or biotechnological applications. Here we apply our framework to guide design of synthetic circuits that use transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulation to suppress variability in the output protein of interest. We find that certain properties and network designs are better than others in their ability to control variability, and here we report on the design guidelines to aid synthetic circuit design to suppress variability, in spite of our uncertain knowledge of parameters.
