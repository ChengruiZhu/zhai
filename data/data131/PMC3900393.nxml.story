Sexual reproduction involves the generation of chromosomally balanced gametes through the specialized cell division of meiosis. A critical component of meiosis is the physical connection of homologous chromosomes through a combination of recombination and sister chromatid cohesion that is necessary for proper chromosome segregation at the first meiotic division. Meiotic recombination is initiated by the introduction of programmed double strand breaks (DSBs) that are processed and bound by RecA-like proteins called recombinases. In vegetative cells, the Rad51 recombinase preferentially mediates strand invasion of sister chromatids, while in meiotic cells, the meiosis-specific Dmc1 recombinase preferentially invades homologs. How Rad51 and Dmc1 activities are coordinated to generate interhomolog recombinants is a key question in meiosis. This work demonstrates that down-regulation of Rad51 activity is important when interhomolog recombination is occurring to prevent Rad51 from competing with Dmc1 for repair of meiotic DSBs. Premature activation of Rad51 results in increased intersister recombination and chromosome missegregation, producing inviable gametes. The evolutionary conservation of both Rad51 and Dmc1 suggests that down-regulation of Rad51 during meiosis may be important in metazoans as well as yeast.
