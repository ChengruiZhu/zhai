Meiosis is the specialized cell division that gives rise to reproductive cells such as sperm and eggs. During meiosis in most organisms, genetic information is exchanged between homologous maternal and paternal chromosomes through the process of homologous recombination. This recombination forms connections between homologous chromosomes that allow them to segregate accurately when the meiotic cell divides. Recombination defects can result in reproductive cells with abnormal chromosome numbers, which are a major cause of developmental disorders and spontaneous abortions in humans. Meiotic recombination is tightly controlled such that each pair of chromosomes undergoes at least one crossover recombination event despite a low average number of crossovers per chromosome. Moreover, multiple crossovers on the same chromosome tend to be evenly and widely spaced. Mechanisms of this control are not well understood, but here we provide evidence that ATM protein is required for normal operation of this process(es) in male mice. ATM has long been known to be involved in cellular responses to DNA damage. Our studies reveal a new function for this protein and also provide new insight into the mechanisms by which meiotic cells ensure accurate transmission of genetic material from one generation to the next.
