In eukaryotes DNA is folded and compacted into manageable units by wrapping around a protein spool of histone proteins to form nucleosomes. By varying the position and dynamics of nucleosomes using energy-dependent chromatin remodeling enzymes, genes can be selectively turned off or on in cells, controlling development and cellular function. Distinct sub-families of ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling enzymes have been characterised. However, their specific nucleosome targets in the genome and how they are recruited to these are not completely defined. Here we have identified nucleosome targets of the conserved higher eukaryotic chromatin remodeling enzyme NURF. Our data indicate three distinct functions for NURF during transcription. NURF organizes nucleosome positions at gene enhancer elements to regulate transcription initiation, but is also required to maintain nucleosome position downstream of the transcription start site of active genes. In addition, we detect NURF remodeling and recruitment at distal insulator sites that are required for functional organisation of the genome. We postulate that NURF function at insulators as well as promoters reflects functional interaction between distant insulators and active promoters, with functional clustering of regulatory elements providing a solution to how chromatin remodeling enzymes engage multiple targets in the genome.
