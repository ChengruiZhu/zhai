We studied complement 1 inhibitor (C1-INH) as an inhibitor of the alternative complement pathway. C1-INH prevented lysis, induced by the alternative complement pathway, of paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH) erythrocytes in human serum. It inhibited the binding of both factors B and C3 to PNH and rabbit erythrocytes and blocked the ability of factor B to restore alternative-pathway function in factor B–depleted serum. C1-INH did not bind to factors B or D but did bind to immobilized C3b and cobra venom factor (CVF), a C3b analogue. C1-INH prevented factor B from binding to CVF-coated beads and dissociated bound factor B from such beads. Factor B and C1-INH showed cross competition in binding to CVF-coated beads. Factor D cleaved factor B into Bb and Ba in the presence of C3b. Cleavage was markedly inhibited when C3b was preincubated with C1-INH. C1-INH inhibited the formation of CVFBb and decreased the C3 cleavage. Removal of C1-INH from serum, in the presence of Mg-EGTA with an anti–C1-INH immunoabsorbant, markedly increased alternative-pathway lysis. C1-INH interacts with C3b to inhibit binding of factor B to C3b. At physiologic concentrations, it is a downregulator of the alternative pathway convertase.
