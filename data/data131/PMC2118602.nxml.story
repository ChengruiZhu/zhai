), the causative agent of the skin disease Buruli ulcer (BU). Surprisingly, infected tissues lack inflammatory infiltrates. Structural similarities between mycolactone and immunosuppressive agents led us to investigate the immunomodulatory properties of mycolactone on dendritic cells (DCs), the key initiators and regulators of immune responses. At noncytotoxic concentrations, phenotypic and functional maturation of both mouse and human DCs was inhibited by mycolactone. Notably, mycolactone blocked the emigration of mouse-skin DCs to draining lymph nodes, as well as their maturation in vivo. In human peripheral blood–derived DCs, mycolactone inhibited the ability to activate allogeneic T cell priming and to produce inflammatory molecules. Interestingly, production of the cytokines interleukin (IL) 12, tumor necrosis factor α, and IL-6 was only marginally affected, whereas production of the chemokines macrophage inflammatory protein (MIP) 1α, MIP-1β, regulated on activation, normal T cell expressed and secreted, interferon γ–inducible protein 10, and monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 was abolished at nanomolar concentrations. Importantly, mycolactone endogenously expressed by
