Diabetes affects millions of people worldwide, and β-cell replacement is one of the promising new strategies for treatment. Induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) can differentiate into any cell type, including pancreatic β cells, providing a potential treatment for diabetes. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying the differentiation of iPSC-derived β cells have not yet been fully elucidated. Here, we generated pancreatic β-like cells from mouse iPSCs using a 3-step protocol and performed deep RNA sequencing to get a transcriptional landscape of iPSC-derived pancreatic β-like cells during the selective differentiation period. We then focused on the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) during the time course of the differentiation period, and these genes underwent Gene Ontology annotation and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathway analysis. In addition, gene-act networks were constructed for these DEGs, and the expression of pivotal genes detected by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction was well correlated with RNA sequence (RNA-seq). Overall, our study provides valuable information regarding the transcriptome changes in β cells derived from iPSCs during differentiation, elucidates the biological process and pathways underlying β-cell differentiation, and promotes the identification and functional analysis of potential genes that could be used for improving functional β-cell generation from iPSCs.
