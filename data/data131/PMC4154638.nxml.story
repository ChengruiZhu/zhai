Regulation of DNA transcription is a key element for the cell to finely regulate its physiological processes. This is acquired by the use of a special class of proteins that bind to DNA and function as transcriptional regulators. ARID domains are responsible for many of these DNA-protein interactions in proteins involved in important physiological functions, including cell-cycle regulation and embryonic development. Nevertheless, the structural effects and the conformational changes induced by DNA-binding on the ARID structure have been poorly characterized so far. Here, we provide the first characterization of long-range effects induced by DNA-binding on ARID domains. In particular, we identified routes of communications from DNA-binding loops to distal residues in helix-5. These routes pre-exist in the free protein and are strengthened by DNA interaction. We also investigated mutations that experimentally impair DNA-binding. Our results show that these mutations perturb wild-type routes of communication, allowing to link their effect on structure and dynamics to function. We have also found a region that might be used for recruitment of biological partners. We predicted the effects induced by mutations at other crucial sites for ARID dynamics. Our results are thus likely to boost the future experimental and structural research on ARID domains.
