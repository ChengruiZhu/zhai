Genome-scale metabolic models are routinely used to simulate the growth of unicellular organisms, and are likely to become an important tool in the medical sciences. The most popular method employed for this task is flux balance analysis (FBA), a simplified mathematical description able to describe the simultaneous activity of hundreds of biochemical reactions. Cellular functions are often dependent on the availability of sufficient energy, and thus a correct representation of energy metabolism appears crucial to metabolic modeling. However, we found that the majority of FBA models generated directly from genome sequences, as well as a minority of carefully curated models, are capable of generating energy out of thin air. These models charge energy metabolites such as ATP without any nutrient uptake. We named the corresponding sets of reactions “erroneous energy generating cycles” (EGCs) and developed a high-throughput algorithm for their identification. We found EGCs in 238 (68%) of 350 metabolic models from three different databases. We developed a second, fully automated method for EGC removal. Simulations on the corrected models typically showed growth rates that were 25% slower than in the original models, demonstrating the importance of checking metabolic model reconstructions for EGCs.
