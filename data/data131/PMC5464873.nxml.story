Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most common and lethal primary intracranial tumor. Actin cytoskeleton regulator Arp2/3 complex stimulates glioma cell motility and migration, and thus triggers tumor invasion. However, little is known regarding the role of actin cytoskeleton in maintaining the stem cell phenotype. Here, we showed that Arp2/3 complex improved stem cell phenotype maintenance through sustaining the activated Notch signaling. ShRNA targeting Notch ligand Delta-like 1 (DLL1) decreased CD133 and Nestin expression, and impaired the self-renewal ability of CD133+ U87-MG and U251-MG glioma cells, indicating DLL1/Notch1 signaling promoted stem cell phenotype maintenance. Interestingly, inhibiting Arp2/3 complex also induced the similar effect of shDLL1. Silencing DLL1 in the Arp2/3 inhibited CD133+ cells did not further abrogate the stem cell phenotype, suggesting DLL1 function requires Arp2/3 complex in glioma initiating cells (GICs). However, exogenous soluble DLL1 (sDLL1) instead of endogenous DLL1 rescued the Arp2/3 inhibition-induced stem cell phenotype suppression. The underlying mechanism was that Arp2/3 inhibition impeded DLL1 vesicular transport from cytoplasm to cell membrane, which resulted in DLL1 unable to activate Notch pathway. Furthermore, we illustrated that Arp2/3 inhibition abolished the tumorigenicity of CD133+ U87-MG neurosphere cells in the intracranial model. These findings suggested that cytoskeleton maintained the stem cell phenotype in GBM, which provide novel therapeutic strategy that anti-invasive targeted therapies may help eliminate GICs.
