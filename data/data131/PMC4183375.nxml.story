The human brain is a fascinating organ full of exquisite anatomical and functional detail. A striking feature of this detail lies in the presence of small modules nested within one another across hierarchical levels of organization. Here we develop and apply computational analysis tools to probe these features of brain architecture by examining network representations in which brain areas are treated as network nodes and links between areas are treated as network edges. The class of methods that we describe are referred to as “multi-resolution techniques” and enable us to identify and isolate neural structures associated with different edge properties. Our methods lead to multi-resolution curves of these network diagnostics over a range of spatial, geometric, and structural scales. For statistical comparison, we contrast our results with those obtained for several benchmark null models. Our work demonstrates that multi-resolution diagnostic curves capture complex organizational profiles in weighted graphs. We apply these methods to the identification of resolution-specific characteristics of healthy weighted graph architecture and altered connectivity profiles in psychiatric disease.
