The feasibility and clinical application of single-hole video-assisted thoracoscope in pulmonary peripheral tumors was examined. From March, 2011 to March, 2015, we retrospectively analyzed the clinical data obtained from 32 patients with pulmonary peripheral tumor that received single-hole thoracoscopic surgery. We completed the surgery via a 1.5-cm incision on the seventh or eighth rib in midaxillary line as the observation hole, and a 4.0–5.0-cm incision in the lateral margin of pectoralis major in the fourth or fifth rib in midaxillary line as the operation hole. All the patients had completed the tumor-reductive surgery under single-hole thoracoscope successfully. None required second operation hole or needed a transfer to thoracotomy. Operation time was 40–100 min with an average of 65.78±15.87 min. Intraoperative blood loss was 20–100 ml, with an average of 47.19±26.91 ml. Post-operative chest drainage time was 3–6 days, with an average of 4.22±0.87 days. Hospitalization time after operation was 5–7 days, with an average hospitalization time of 5.97±0.82 days. No patient received a second surgery for pulmonary leak or bleeding and no patient had any complication. All the cases recovered without any problem. In conclusion, for patients with pulmonary peripheral tumor, single-hole video-assisted thoracoscope could further reduce their surgical trauma. The operation was safe and feasible and worthy of wide application.
