Eukaryotic transcription occurs within the nucleus where DNA is packaged into high order chromosome structures. Some long-distance chromosomal interactions play an important role in gene regulation in higher eukaryotic species, such as mouse and human. In budding yeast, gene expression is traditionally thought to be regulated over short distances because the upstream regulatory sequences (URSs) are usually located close to the core promoters. However, recent chromosome conformation capture experiments have detected numerous long-distance chromosomal interactions in the yeast genome. The function of these interactions in gene regulation remains unclear. Here, we developed a new assay to screen for long-distance interactions that affect the activity of a reporter gene. We found three regulatory mechanisms that act from a distance: silencing, transcriptional interference, and 3D clustering, which alter expression level of the reporter gene as well as its cell-to-cell variability. Our results demonstrate that transcription in budding yeast, similar to transcription in higher eukaryotes, can be regulated over long distances. We anticipate our assay can be used as a general platform to screen for functional long-distance chromosomal interactions that affect gene expression.
