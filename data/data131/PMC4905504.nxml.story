Long non-coding RNAs are emerging as crucial regulators and prognostic markers in multiple cancers including non small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). In this study, we screened LINCO1133 as a new candidate lncRNA which promotes NSCLC development and progression, in two independent datasets (GSE18842 and GSE19804) from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO). LINC01133 is previously found to be over-expressed in lung squamous cell cancer (LSCC) and knockdown its expression inhibits LSCC cells invasion. However, its' molecular mechanism and downstream targets involving in regulation of cancer cells phenotype is not known. Here, we found that LINC01133 expression is up-regulated in NSCLC tissues, and its' over-expression is associated with patients poor prognosis and short survival time. LINC01133 knockdown decreased NSCLC cells proliferation, migration, invasion and induced cell cycle G1/S phase arrest and cell apoptosis. Mechanistic investigations showed that LINC01133 could interact with EZH2, LSD1 and recruit them to KLF2, P21 or E-cadherin promoter regions to repress their transcription. Furthermore, rescue experiments demonstrated that LINC01133 oncogenic function is partly through regulating KLF2. Lastly, we found that there was negative correlation between LINC01133 and KLF2, P21 or E-cadherin in NSCLC. Overall, our findings illuminate how LINC01133 over-expression confers an oncogenic function in NSCLC that may offer a novel therapy target in this disease.
