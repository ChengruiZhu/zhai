The present study aimed to examine the association of p53 expression levels with clinicopathological features and prognosis of patients with colon cancer following surgery. The present study included 484 patients with colon cancer that underwent colon resection between December 2003 and December 2011. All follow-ups were censored in December 2013 with a median follow-up time of 43 months. Kaplan-Meier survival curves and Cox regression analysis were used to determine predictors for overall survival rate. p53 expression status (positive or negative) was significantly different between patient groups when categorized by age distribution, disease course, tumor location, maximum tumor diameter, depth of tumor invasion, Dukes' stage, distant metastasis and lymph node (LN) metastasis (P<0.05). Cox regression analysis revealed that age, surgery type, histological subtypes, tumor size, tumor location, LN metastasis, distant metastases, Dukes' stage and p53 expression status are independent factors influencing the survival rate of patients with colon cancer following surgery (P<0.05). Therefore, the present study revealed that the loss of p53 expression levels in tumors was associated with aggressive clinicopathological characteristics in patients with colon cancer.
