All LCHADD patients are homozygous for the common mutation. Three are siblings. Diagnosis was first established biochemically. Nine/14 (64%) were prematures, with IRDS occurring in six. In nine (64%), diagnosis was established through newborn screening, the remaining five (36%) were diagnosed clinically. Four pregnancies were complicated by HELLP syndrome, one by preeclampsia. In two, intrauterine growth retardation and placental insufficiency were reported. Five were diagnosed with hepatopathy at some point, seven with cardiomyopathy and eight with retinopathy, clinically relevant only in one patient. Polyneuropathy is only present in one. Three patients have a PEG, one is regularly fed via NG-tube. Growth is normal in all, as well as psychomotor development, except for two extremely premature girls. In 11 patients, 165 episodes with elevated creatine kinase concentrations were observed with 6-31 (median 14) per patient; three have shown no elevated CK concentrations. Median total carnitine on therapy was 19 μmol/l (range 11-61). For 14 patients, there have been 181 hospitalizations (median 9 per patient), comprising 1337 in-patient-days. All centres adhere to treatment with a fat-defined diet; patients have between 15% and 40% of their energy intake from fat (median 29%), out of which between 20% and 80% are medium-chain triglycerides (MCT) (median 62%). Four patients have been treated with heptanoate (C7).
