Vulvar neoplasms represent four percent of all gynecological cancers. While most cases of vulvar neoplasms are benign, two percent of patients present with malignant disease. We present the case of a 37-year-old premenopausal female who presented to an outside institution with a lump in her left vulva, which had progressively enlarged to the size of an egg. A wide local excision of the left vulva was performed, and the pathology revealed a high-grade sarcoma, not otherwise specified (NOS), with negative margins. Imaging showed enlarged bilateral external iliac lymph nodes, likely metastatic. After discussion at a multidisciplinary gynecology oncology tumor board, she was treated with gemcitabine/docetaxelÂ chemotherapy, followed by a left inguinal lymph node dissection and a left radical vulvectomy after being referred to our centre. The final pathology at that time showed a residual sarcoma of 3.5 mm in the left vulva with no lympho-vascular invasion (LVI) and negative margins, with the closest, laterally, at 2 mm. A total of three lymph nodes were negative. She received additional chemotherapy postoperatively. Approximately one year later, she returned to her gynecologist with a 1 cm mass on the left vulva. She underwent a left hemi-vulvectomy and lymph node dissection, and pathology confirmed the presence of a high-grade sarcoma with close margins. She received adjuvant radiotherapy. Three months later, she presented with persistent cough and pneumonia. Imaging revealed a 10 cm lung mass, which was believed to be metastasis from the vulva. This was confirmed with biopsy and was completely resected.
