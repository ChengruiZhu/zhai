A large number of proteins in the cell are modified post-translationally by phosphorylation at multiple specific locations. This can help bring about interesting dynamical behaviors such as bistability or all-or-none responses to stimuli. Such behaviors are in turn important for cellular decision-making, differentiation, or the regulation of cellular processes. In this paper we propose the use of a specific technique for modeling allosteric multisite proteins, which can be thought of as the reduced version of a more detailed set of reactions. After validating this technique computationally by comparison to more detailed systems, we apply it to a new model of a signal transduction pathway with several multisite proteins. The model is concerned with a mechanism in budding yeast that is thought to measure the extent of daughter bud growth and send a signal to initiate mitosis when sufficient growth has occurred. Using the given framework we derive an analytically tractable model that creates the desired all-or-none signal. Overall, we give quantitative support to a newly discovered biochemical pathway, and we show the utility of the new modeling framework in the context of a realistic biological problem.
