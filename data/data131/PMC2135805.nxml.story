 and studied with the electron microscope. In preparations from three out of six tumors, an unusual particulate body has been found associated with the cells. The particles appear to have a spherical shape and a double structure consisting of a dense center and less dense outer zone. The diameter of the central dense portion is fairly uniform from particle to particle, averaging approximately 75 mµ, whereas the outside, whole particle diameter is more variable and averages about 130 mµ. From the micrographs it would appear that these peculiar virus-like bodies are situated chiefly in the ectoplasmic portion of the cell. They may occur singly, in pairs, or in clumps of varying sizes. Cells containing great numbers of the particles show signs of degeneration, and cell fragments are frequently encountered with many particles on them. So far, the particles have been found only in association with the epithelial cells of the cultures. They are apparently not derived from the culture media. All in all the findings are consonant with the view that the particles represent the milk agent. Further evidence for or against this assumption is being sought from a study of cells from normal tissue and tumors demonstrated to be agent-free.
