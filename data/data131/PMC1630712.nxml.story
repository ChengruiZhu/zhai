One of the foundations of molecular evolution is the idea that more closely related species are more similar on the molecular level. One example that has been known for several years is the genomic composition of short words (i.e., short segments) of DNA. Given a sample of genome sequence, one can count the occurrences of all words of a certain length. It turns out that closely related species have more similar word frequencies. The pattern of how these frequencies change over evolutionary time is likely to be influenced by the many functions of the genome (coding for proteins, controlling gene expression, etc.). Bush and Lahn investigated the influence of genomic function on word-frequency variation in 13 animal genomes. Using a method designed to isolate the effects acting at particular word sizes, the authors examined how word frequencies vary in different categories of noncoding sequence. They found that interspecies patterns of word-frequency variation change depending on word size and sequence category. These results suggest that noncoding sequence is subject to different functional constraints depending on its location in the genome. An especially interesting possibility is that the patterns in longer words may reflect evolutionary changes in gene regulatory machinery.
