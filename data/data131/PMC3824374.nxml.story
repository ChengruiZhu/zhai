Sifalimumab serum concentration-time data were collected from a phase Ib study (MI-CP152) designed to evaluate the safety and tolerability of sifalimumab in adult patients with SLE. Sifalimumab was administered every 14 days as a 30- to 60-minute intravenous infusion with escalating doses of 0.3, 1.0, 3.0, and 10 mg/kg and serum concentrations were collected over 350 days. A total of 120 patients provided evaluable pharmacokinetic data with a total of 2,370 serum concentrations. Sifalimumab serum concentrations were determined using a validated colorimetric enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) with a lower limit of quantitation of 1.25 μg/mL. Population pharmacokinetic modeling of sifalimumab was performed using a non-linear mixed effects modeling approach with NONMEM VII software. Impact of patient demographics, clinical indices, and biomarkers on pharmacokinetic parameters were explored using a stepwise forward selection and backward elimination approach. The appropriateness of the final model was tested using visual predictive check (VPC). The impact of body WT-based and fixed dosing of sifalimumab was evaluated using a simulation approach. The final population model was utilized for phase IIb dosing projections.
