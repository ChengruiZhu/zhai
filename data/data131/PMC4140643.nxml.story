Flexibility in biomolecular recognition is crucial for the function. Flexibility often leads to moderate binding affinity but high binding specificity, challenging the conventional wisdom that high specificity is guaranteed by high affinity. Currently, understanding of the relationship between affinity and specificity in flexible biomolecular recognition is still obscure, even in a qualitative way. By exploring the intrinsic biomolecular recognition energy landscapes, we provided a novel way to quantify the thermodynamic intrinsic specificity by energy landscape topography and kinetic specificity by association rate. We show quantitatively that flexibility decreases binding affinity while increases binding specificity, and the relative changes in affinity and specificity are strongly correlated with the degree of flexibility. Our results show that more (less) flexibility leads to weaker (stronger) coupling between affinity and specificity. Importantly, we demonstrated that flexibility modulates affinity and specificity through the underlying energy landscape. Our study establishes the quantitative relationship among flexibility, affinity and specificity, bridging the gap between theory and experiments.
