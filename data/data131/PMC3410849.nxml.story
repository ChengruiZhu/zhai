The number of known protein-protein interactions (PPIs) grows rapidly, yet their molecular details remain largely unknown. Over the last years, structural biologists have addressed this issue with an increased output of structurally resolved hetero complexes. This wealth now enables statistically significant quantitative statements about interface properties. Here, we addressed the question how interfaces differ when observing the same proteinprotein interaction twice. A new dataset derived from the entire PDB was analyzed employing different definitions for the “same interaction” and a range of interface similarity measures. The hypothesis was that the interface between the same pair of proteins stays the same irrespectively of how often it is measured. Although the results mostly confirm this hypothesis, the surprising finding was how often it was not true: for many comparisons of interfaces, the molecular details of the interaction differed importantly, often without the slightest change of amino acids. In addition, no matter how much “special cases” were sieved out, the essential message remained: interfaces appear immensely plastic. Hand-selected sample structures largely support this view. In general, we complement a series of recent studies focusing either on family-family interactions or exploring other aspects of protein-protein complexes.
