The binding of tumor cells by activated macrophages is an initial and necessary event in the cytolysis of these targets. The data here indicate that membrane preparations from RL sigma 1 leukemia targets, EL-4 lymphoma targets, and P815 mastocytoma targets each inhibited binding of its homologous target to bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG)- activated murine macrophages in a dose-dependent fashion. Similar amounts of membrane from lymphocytes did not alter binding of the three neoplastic target to BCG-macrophages. Membranes of the three targets also inhibited binding of the heterologous neoplastic targets. Inhibitory activity of membrane preparations from P815, EL-4, and RL sigma 1 targets could be adsorbed by incubation of limiting concentrations of the membrane preparations with BCG-activated macrophages but not with thioglycollate broth-elicited macrophages. Exposure of BCG macrophages to membrane preparations from RL sigma 1, FL-4, or P815 targets inhibited subsequent cytolysis of the three targets. Inhibitory activity was increased in preparations enriched for plasma membrane. The data suggest that binding of three murine, nonadherent neoplastic targets to BCG-activated murine macrophages is mediated, in part, by recognition structures present within the plasma membranes of the three targets.
