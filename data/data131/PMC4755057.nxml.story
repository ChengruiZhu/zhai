This study reports our 15-year experience, in Sicily, with the use of voice prostheses, analysing the different variables that have influenced the success or failure of speech rehabilitation. The retrospective clinical analysis was carried out by reviewing the clinical histories of 95 patients with laryngeal cancer, in whom a voice prosthesis had been placed by trachea-oesophageal puncture between 1998 and 2013. Age, type of tumour, type of surgery, use of prior radiation therapy, type of puncture, prosthesis used and its duration, number of replacements, complications and causes for prosthetic success or failure were analysed. The results showed a mean of Harrison-Robillard-Schultz (HRS) TEP rating scale of 11.8 in primary TEP and 12.6 in secondary TEP (P =0.613). PORT did not affect overall rehabilitation success. In these patients, the mean HRS rating scale was 11.2, with long-term success of 85% (P =0.582). In patients over 70 years old, long-term success was 82.5%, with 78% in primary and 86% in secondary TEP, the mean HRS was 11.2 in primary and 12 in secondary TEP (P =0.648). In total, long-term success was 87.5%, with 84% in primary and 91% in secondary TEP. The results obtained by retrospective analysis of 15 years of prosthetic rehabilitation in the Sicilian territory highlighted standard rehabilitation, in terms of intra and postoperative complications, fistula related pathology and overall success.
