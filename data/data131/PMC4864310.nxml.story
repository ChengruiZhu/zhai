Barrett’s Esophagus (BE) is a metaplastic precursor to esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC). When a patient is diagnosed with BE, it is generally not known how long he/she has had this condition because BE is asymptomatic. While the question of how long a premalignant tissue or lesion has been resident in an organ (dwell time) may not be of importance for cases where curative interventions are readily available (such as adenomas in the colon), for BE, curative interventions are either costly or carry patient risks. Knowledge of a precursor’s dwell time may therefore be advantageous in determining the cancer risk due to the stepwise accumulation of critical mutations in the precursor. In this study, we create a molecular clock model that infers patient-specific BE onsets from DNA methylation data. We show that there is considerable variation in the predicted BE onset times which translates, using mathematical modeling of EAC, into large variation in individual EAC risks. We make the case that, notwithstanding other known risk factors such as chronological age, gender, reflux status, etc., knowledge of biological tissue age can provide valuable patient-specific risk information when a patient is first diagnosed with BE.
