Case-control association testing has proven to be useful for identification of genetic variants that affect susceptibility to disease. One can expect to gain power for detecting such variants by including relevant covariates in the analysis, by accounting for any relatedness of sampled individuals, and by making use of partial information in the data. For analysis of continuously-varying traits, variations on linear mixed-model (LMM) approaches have proven effective at achieving some of these goals. However, for case-control or binary trait mapping, there remain significant challenges. Direct application of LMM approaches to binary traits suffers from power loss when covariate effects are strong, and existing generalized LMM approaches can perform poorly in the presence of trait model misspecification and partially missing data. We propose CERAMIC, a method for binary trait mapping, which is computationally feasible for large genome-wide studies, and which gains power over previous approaches by improved trait modeling, retrospective assessment of significance, accounting for sample structure, and making use of partially missing data. We illustrate this approach in genome-wide association mapping of type 2 diabetes in data from the Framingham Heart Study.
