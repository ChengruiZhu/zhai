Myxobacteria are social bacteria that upon starvation form multicellular fruiting bodies whose shape in different species can range from simple mounds to elaborate tree-like structures. The formation of fruiting bodies is a result of collective cell movement on a solid surface. Since collective cell motility during biological morphogenesis is also common in higher organisms, myxobacteria serve as a relatively simple model organism to study multicellular movement, organization and development. In the course of myxobacterial development, groups of flexible rod-shaped cells form streams and move in circular or spiral patterns to form aggregation centers that can become sites of fruiting body formation. The mechanisms of such cell movement patterns are not well understood. In this study, by means of a computational mass-spring model, we demonstrate that the formation of streams and circular aggregates during myxobacterial development can be explained by short-range head-to-tail guiding between individual cells, whereby movement direction of the head of one cell is affected by the nearby presence of the tail of another cell. We suggest that such interactions between cells can result from physical adhesion, response to a diffusible substance or slime extruded by cells, or the action of cell motility engine.
