The predictive value of plasma protein C level in sepsis has been demonstrated in a number of studies in which depressed protein C levels were associated with increased likelihood of negative outcome. Data from the PROWESS (Recombinant Human Activated Protein C Worldwide Evaluation in Severe Sepsis) trial indicate that administration of drotrecogin alfa (activated; DrotAA) leads to an increase in endogenous protein C levels in severe sepsis patients. In a group as heterogeneous as sepsis patients, the currently approved dose and duration of administration (24 Î¼g/kg per hour for 96 hours) might not be optimal in some individuals. The RESPOND (Research Evaluating Serial Protein C levels in severe sepsis patients ON Drotrecogin alfa [activated]) trial is a phase II study being conducted to explore the use of endogenous protein C level as both a biomarker and a steering parameter for administration of DrotAA. Eligible patients will receive DrotAA either at the normal, currently approved dose and duration of administration ('standard therapy') or at a higher dose with variable infusion duration or variable infusion duration only ('alternative therapy'). The duration of DrotAA infusion in the alternative therapy arm depends on the individual response in terms of sustained increase in endogenous protein C. The ultimate aims of this and potential following studies are as follows: to establish serial plasma protein C measurement as a biomarker that will aid in the identification of severe sepsis patients who are most likely to benefit from DrotAA therapy, to enable adjustment of DrotAA therapy in individual patients (specifically, the possibility to use a higher dose and to adjust the infusion duration), and to provide guidance to the clinician regarding whether the patient is responding to DrotAA.
