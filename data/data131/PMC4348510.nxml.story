The researchers used computerized tests to measure the development of working memory (the system that holds multiple pieces of transitory information in the mind where they can be manipulated), superior working memory (working memory that involves continuous updating of the working memory buffer), and attentiveness every three months over a 12-month period in 2,715 primary school children attending 39 schools exposed to high or low levels of traffic-related air pollution and paired by socioeconomic index. That is, the researchers compared three cognitive development outcomes in the children attending each school where exposure to air pollution was high with the same outcomes in children attending a school with a similar socioeconomic index where exposure to pollution was low; school pairing was undertaken to avoid “confounding” by social class, a factor that is known to affect cognitive development. Statistical analyses of these data indicated that the increase in cognitive development over time among children attending highly polluted schools was less than that among children attending paired lowly polluted schools, even after adjusting for additional factors that affect cognitive development. Thus, for example, there was an 11.5% 12-month increase in working memory at the lowly polluted schools but only a 7.4% 12-month increase in working memory at the highly polluted schools. Other analyses indicated that children attending schools with higher levels of traffic-related air pollutants in either the courtyard or in the classroom experienced a substantially smaller increase over the 12-month study in all three cognitive measurements than those attending schools with lower levels of pollutants.
