Depression is a medical condition that results in significant morbidity, mortality and reduced quality of life. Understanding the molecular mechanism in which stress leads to depression is essential for the discovery of new clinical interventions. Currently, despite considerable research, the mechanisms underlying stress-related illnesses are unclear. In this study, we reveal a novel link between the interaction of serine protease neuropsin with corticosterone and the development of chronic stress induced depressive-like behaviour. We found no difference in baseline behaviour between neuropsin knockout and wild-type mice. However, our results show that neuropsin knockout mice are protected against the development of depressive-like behaviours and memory impairment following chronic stress. We suggest the dysregulation of the glutamate system may lead to increased reactive oxygen species and act as a possible mechanism in which stress changes hippocampal architecture. We found that inactivation of neuropsin limits the extent of these anatomical changes in both chronic stress and corticosterone injection exposed cohorts. In this study, we outline a mechanism that may open new possibilities for the treatment of stress-related psychiatric disorders.
