 = 20)-infected patients with compensated cirrhosis treated for 12 weeks. Two of 33 DAA-experienced and 2 of 12 GT3-infected patients treated for 12 weeks experienced virologic failure. Pooled resistance analysis, grouped by HCV subtype, treatment duration, prior treatment experience, and cirrhosis status, was conducted. Among DAA-naive GT1b-infected patients, the baseline prevalence of NS3-D168E was 1.2%, that of NS5A-L31M was 3.6%, and that of NS5A-Y93H was 17.6%. Baseline polymorphisms in NS3 or NS5A were less prevalent in GT2, with the exception of the common L/M31 polymorphism in NS5A. Among DAA-experienced GT1b-infected patients (30/32 daclatasvir plus asunaprevir-experienced patients), the baseline prevalence of NS3-D168E/T/V was 48.4%, that of NS5A-L31F/I/M/V was 81.3%, that of the NS5A P32deletion was 6.3%, and that of NS5A-Y93H was 59.4%. Common baseline polymorphisms in NS3 and/or NS5A had no impact on treatment outcomes in GT1- and GT2-infected patients; the impact on GT3-infected patients could not be assessed due to the enrollment of patients infected with diverse subtypes and the limited number of patients. The glecaprevir-pibrentasvir combination regimen allows a simplified treatment option without the need for HCV subtyping or baseline resistance testing for DAA-naive GT1- or GT2-infected patients.
