Participant demographics consisted of 126 males and 86 females with a mean age of 60 ±9.6. There were 93 non-operative subjects and 119 in the operative group. Baseline characteristics between groups indicated a significant difference in age (p<.001), gender (p<.05), and cause of injury (p<.001). Among baseline scores there were differences in pain VAS (p<.05), shoulder activity level (p<.01), functional comorbidity (p<.05), ASES (p<.05), and WORC (p<.05), with all baseline scores indicating “worse” scores for the operative group. There were no significant differences noted between groups for baseline PCS (p=.508) and MCS (p=.862) scores. Paired samples t-tests within the non-operative group indicate no difference between baseline and 64 week PCS (p=.434) and MCS (p=.203) scores. The operative group PCS and MCS scores were both significantly different from baseline to 64 week scores (p<.001, p<.001) respectively. Between groups results show there was no significant difference in 64 week MCS scores (p=.539), however there was a significant difference in 64 week PCS scores noted (p<.001). Factors predictive of higher MCS scores were non-diabetic (β=4.82, p<.05), non-smoker (β=4.52, p<.05), lower functional comorbidity (β= -1.22, p<.05), higher baseline pain VAS (β=.087, p<.05), and a lower WORC score (β= -.011, p<.001). Factors predictive of higher PCS scores were surgical intervention (β=2.96, p<.01), non-diabetic (β=2.87, p<.05), lower functional comorbidity (β= -1.18, p<.001), higher baseline ASES (β=.128, p<.01), and lower baseline WORC (β= -.005, p<.01).
