In order to maintain a steady internal environment, our bodies must be able to specifically recognize old and damaged red blood cells (RBCs), and remove them from the circulation in a timely manner. Clusters of membrane protein band 3, which form in response to elevated oxidative damage, serve as essential molecular markers that initiate this cell removal process. However, little is known about the details of how these clusters are formed and how their properties change under different conditions. To understand these mechanisms in detail, we developed a computational model that enables the prediction of the time course profiles of metabolic intermediates, as well as the visualization of the resulting band 3 distribution during oxidative treatment. Our model predictions were in good agreement with previous published experimental data, and provided predictive insights on the key factors of cluster formation. Furthermore, simulation experiments of the effects of multiple oxidative pulses and cytoskeletal defect using the model also suggested that clustering is enhanced under such conditions. Analyses using our model can provide hypotheses and suggest experiments to aid the understanding of the physiology of anemia-associated RBC disorders, and optimization of quality control of RBCs in stored blood.
