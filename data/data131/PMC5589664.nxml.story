 on meningioma primary cell cultures, both alone and in combination with the mTOR inhibitor everolimus. Significant mRNA expression levels of SST1, SST2, and SST5 were observed in 40.5%, 100%, and 35% of meningioma samples, respectively. Pasireotide had a significantly stronger inhibitory effect on cell proliferation than octreotide. The effect of pasireotide, but not of octreotide, was significantly stronger in the group expressing the highest level of SST1 mRNA. Combined treatment with pasireotide and everolimus induced a higher reduction in cell viability than that with octreotide plus everolimus. Moreover, pasireotide decreased Akt phosphorylation and reversed everolimus-induced Akt hyperphosphorylation to a higher degree than octreotide. Using 4E-BP1 siRNA (si4E-BP), we demonstrated that 4E-BP1 protein silencing significantly reversed the response to everolimus, both alone and in combination with SSAs. Moreover, si4E-BP completely reversed the inhibition of cyclin D1 expression level and the increase in p27kip1 induced by SSAs, both alone and in combination with everolimus. Our results strongly support the need for further studies on the combination of pasireotide and everolimus in medical therapy for meningiomas.
