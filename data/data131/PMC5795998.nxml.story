Carbon Catabolite Repression (CCR) has fascinated scientists and researchers around the globe for the past few decades. This important mechanism allows preferential utilization of an energy-efficient and readily available carbon source over relatively less easily accessible carbon sources. This mechanism helps microorganisms to obtain maximum amount of glucose in order to keep pace with their metabolism. Microorganisms assimilate glucose and highly favorable sugars before switching to less-favored sources of carbon such as organic acids and alcohols. In CCR of filamentous fungi, CreA acts as a transcription factor, which is regulated to some extent by ubiquitination. CreD-HulA ubiquitination ligase complex helps in CreA ubiquitination, while CreB-CreC deubiquitination (DUB) complex removes ubiquitin from CreA, which causes its activation. CCR of fungi also involves some very crucial elements such as Hexokinases, cAMP, Protein Kinase (PKA), Ras proteins, G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR), Adenylate cyclase, RcoA and SnfA. Thorough study of molecular mechanism of CCR is important for understanding growth, conidiation, virulence and survival of filamentous fungi. This review is a comprehensive revision of the regulation of CCR in filamentous fungi as well as an updated summary of key regulators, regulation of different CCR-dependent mechanisms and its impact on various physical characteristics of filamentous fungi.
