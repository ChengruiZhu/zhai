Paired-like homeodomain 1 (PITX1) genes are essential in human development. In the present study, PITX1 protein expression was evaluated in human normal oral mucosa, oral epithelial dysplasia and oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC), with the aim of examining the expression patterns of these critical genes during the multi-stage transformation of oral epithelial dysplasia to OSCC. PITX1 and Ki-67 expression were assessed by immunohistochemistry in 26 individuals with normal oral mucosa, 106 patients with oral epithelial dysplasia and 97 OSCC patients. The labeling indices (LIs) of PITX1 and Ki-67 were calculated and their correlation with the incidence of malignancy was evaluated. The PITX1 LI of the dysplasia specimens was significantly lower than that of the normal oral mucosa samples, but significantly higher than that of the OSCC samples. The oral epithelial dysplasia patients that exhibited low PITX1 expression showed a significantly higher incidence of malignant transformation than those exhibiting high PITX1 expression, regardless of the histological grades of their oral epithelial dysplasias. On the other hand, no correlation was observed between the Ki-67 LI and the incidence of malignancy. These results suggested that PITX1 suppression is associated with malignant transformation in the oral epithelium and that PITX1 expression may serve as a novel biomarker for predicting prognosis in oral epithelial dysplasia.
