Geographical structure influences the dynamics of the expansion of populations into new habitats and the relative importance of the evolutionary forces of mutation, selection, genetic drift, and gene flow. While populations often spread and evolve in highly complex environments, simplified scenarios allow one to uncover the important factors determining a population front’s shape and a population’s genetic composition. Here, we follow this approach using a combination of experiments, theory, and simulations. Specifically, we use an inkjet printer to create well-defined bacterial patterns on which a population of bacteriophage expands and characterize the transient perturbations in the population front caused by individual obstacles. A theoretical understanding allows us to make predictions for more general obstacles than those investigated experimentally. We use stochastic simulations and experimental expansions of bacterial populations to show that the population front dynamics is closely linked to the fate of genotypes at different parts of the front. We anticipate that our findings will lead to understanding of how a wide class of environmental structures influences spreading populations and their genetic composition.
