Accurate segregation of chromosomes during mitosis is essential to prevent genetic instability and aneuploidy that lead to cancer and other diseases. Centrosomes and spindle pole bodies mediate the assembly of a microtubule-based structure known as the mitotic spindle, which physically separates chromosomes during mitosis so that the two daughter cells contain a complete copy of the genetic material as well as a spindle pole. During every cell cycle, the DNA and the spindle pole must be duplicated exactly once to ensure proper formation of a bipolar mitotic spindle. In yeast cells, the nuclear envelope does not break down, so the spindle pole must be inserted into the nuclear membrane so that it can form both the microtubules involved in the mitotic spindle and those involved in positioning of the nucleus. How a large protein complex such as the spindle pole body is inserted into the lipid layers of the nuclear membrane is not well understood. We show that the evolutionarily conserved SUN protein Mps3 is involved in spindle pole insertion into the nuclear membrane. This likely reflects a function for SUN proteins in controlling nuclear envelope structure by modulating the types of lipids that are present in the nuclear membrane.
