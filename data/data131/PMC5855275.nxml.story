Patients with periodontitis may have one or few teeth with hopeless prognosis, which would have to be extracted before initiation of orthodontic therapy. Periodontal therapy aims to prolong the lifespan of dentition, as preserving natural dentition is always the best treatment option. The decision to retain a tooth is always based on the probability of long-term success of one or more treatment modality. A 17-year-old female patient seeking fixed orthodontic treatment presented with the left mandibular first molar tooth (36) having hopeless periodontal prognosis with advanced primary periodontal and secondary endodontic lesion, grade III mobility, and grade II furcation involvement. Root canal treatment followed by periodontal surgery using a combination of bone graft (allograft) and platelet-rich fibrin membrane resulted in a clinical and radiographic indication of periodontal healing. The tooth (36) was even used for orthodontic anchorage 3-month postsurgically and was maintained for 2 years. Appropriate diagnosis and meticulous multidisciplinary treatment approach can lead to the restoration of health and function of the teeth with severe loss of attachment and bone loss and can even be used for orthodontic anchorage.
