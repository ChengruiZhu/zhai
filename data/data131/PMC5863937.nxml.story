Hyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotide-modulated (HCN) channels are tetrameric voltage-controlled ion channels in the cell membrane of specialized nerve and heart cells. Their main function is to generate a so-called pacemaker current which plays a key role in the generation of electrical rhythmicity. A special messenger molecule, cAMP, synthesized within these cells at sympathetic stimulation, can bind to these channels, thereby enhancing channel opening evoked by voltage. The mechanism of this dual activation is still poorly understood. Here we quantified this duality of activation for HCN2 channels by globally fitting hidden Markovian state models to extensive sets of data. We propose that activation of this tetrameric channel requires for a full description only two voltage-dependent steps that are followed by a voltage-independent opening step of the channel pore. According to this model analysis cAMP exerts multiple effects on channel activation: It notably accelerates the charge movement of the voltage-dependent steps and reduces the number of the involved electrical charges. Furthermore, it introduces an additional closed state and stabilizes the open pore. Together, our results provide new insight into the duality of voltage- and cAMP-induced activation of HCN channels.
