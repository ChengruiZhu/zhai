The first comprehensive spectroelectrochemical account of the behaviour of regioregular (RR-P3HT) and statistical (ST-P3HT) poly(3-hexylthiophenes) in solution is presented, in contrast to the many reports dealing with P3HT films merely deposited from solution. The conducted experiments revealed that the two types of P3HTs behave in sharply different ways upon the application of electrochemical stimuli: ST-P3HT readily precipitates at mildly oxidative potentials, while the precipitation of the RR-P3HT takes place to a much lesser extent, even at higher potentials. The two polymers, studied via UV–Vis–NIR–EPR spectroelectrochemistry, exhibited properties mostly in line with earlier reports. Further study revealed that RR-P3HT largely remains in solution, even in its doped form, whereas only traces of the doped ST-P3HT are observed in solution in identical conditions. The high concentration of the doped RR-P3HT in solution can be explained by its ability to form soluble polymer agglomerates, in which the positive charge of the p-doped chains is stabilised by and delocalised over neighbouring, interacting undoped chains. These conclusions are consistent with SEM micrographs, which show that after cycling the potential of the electrode in a solution of ST-P3HT, a uniform layer is formed, covering most of the surface of the electrode, whereas in the case of RR-P3HT surface coverage is marginal and formed layer has the appearance of veined blotches.
