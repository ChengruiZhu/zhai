G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) are a major target for drug discovery. These receptors are highly dynamic membrane proteins, and have had limited tractability using with biophysical screens that are widely adopted for globular protein targets. Thus, structure-based virtual screening (SBVS) holds great promise as a complement to physical screening for rational design of novel drugs. Indeed, the increasing number of atomic-detail GPCR X-ray crystal structures has coincided with an increase in prospective SBVS studies that have identified novel compounds. However, experimentally solved GPCR structures do not meet the full demand for SBVS, as the GPCR structural landscape is incomplete, lacking both in coverage of available GPCRs, and diversity in both receptor conformations and the chemistry of co-crystalised ligands. Here we present a novel computational GPCR binding pocket refinement method that can generate predictive GPCR/ligand complexes with improved SBVS performance. This ligand-directed modeling workflow uses parallel processing and efficient algorithms to search the GPCR/ligand conformational space faster and more efficiently than the widely used protein refinement method molecular dynamics. In this study, the resulting models are evaluated both structurally, and in retrospective SBVS. We demonstrate improved performance of refined models over their starting structures in the majority of our test cases.
