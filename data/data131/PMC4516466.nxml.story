Localized phasic contractions in the bladder wall (autonomous activity) have been hypothesized to be an integral part of a motor/sensory system contributing to bladder sensation. The sites responsible for generating this activity, the mechanisms involved in its propagation and modulation remain unknown. This phasic motor activity is modulated by exogenous prostaglandins. Therefore, analysis of the sites of prostaglandin production and action within the bladder wall may shed light on the mechanisms of generation and modulation of this phasic activity. In this paper we report the localization of immuno-reactivity indicative of the expression of cyclo-oxygenase enzyme type I (COX I-IR) within the bladder wall. Basically, three types of COX I-IR cell were identified: epithelial cells in the basal and intermediate layers of the urothelium, complex vimentin-positive and COX I-IR cells in the lamina propria and vimentin-negative COX I-IR cells in the lamina propria and on the surface of the inner muscle bundles. These vimentin-negative/COX I-IR cells appear to be in close apposition to a continuous network of vimentin-positive cells, which extends from the lamina propria into the inner muscle layers and subsequently into the outer muscle layers. However, the interstitial cells in this region might form a distinctly different sub-type. First, the interstitial cells in this region differ from those in the inner layer by their responsiveness to NO with a rise in cGMP. Two subtypes have been identified: cells on the surface of the muscle bundles and within the muscle bundles. Second, COX I-IR cells are not associated with the interstitial cells in the outer layers. The physiological significance for these apparent differences in the interstitial cell network is not clear. However, such differences are likely to reflect differences in the processes involved in their activation, modulation and control.
