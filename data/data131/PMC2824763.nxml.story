Type 2 diabetes (T2D) is a complex disease that involves many genes and environmental factors. Genome-wide and candidate-gene association studies have thus far identified at least 19 regions containing genes that may confer a risk for T2D. However, most of these studies were conducted with patients of European descent. We studied Chinese patients with T2D and identified two genes, PTPRD and SRR, that were not previously known to be involved in diabetes and are involved in biological pathways different from those implicated in T2D by previous association reports. PTPRD is a protein tyrosine phosphatase and may affect insulin signaling on its target cells. SRR encodes a serine racemase that synthesizes D-serine from L-serine. Both D-serine (coagonist) and the neurotransmitter glutamate bind to NMDA receptors and trigger excitatory neurotransmission in the brain. Glutamate signaling also regulates insulin and glucagon secretion in pancreatic islets. Thus, SRR and D-serine, in addition to regulating insulin and glucagon secretion, may play a role in the etiology of T2D. Our study suggests that, in different patient populations, different genes may confer risks for diabetes. Our findings may lead to a better understanding of the molecular pathogenesis of T2D.
