Hundreds of microbial species thrive within the gut of humans and other animals, where they can influence the health of their host in profound ways. The factors that shape the composition of the resident gut microbiota are not well understood, but identifying them represents an important step toward developing treatments for diseases associated with microbial imbalances. Current experimental approaches poorly capture spatial and temporal aspects of microbial interactions within the gut, and yet these features may hold clues to what determines the composition of the microbiota. To address this issue, we used state-of-the-art live imaging to track two bacterial species within the intestine of a model vertebrate host, the zebrafish. We observed strikingly different interplay between the spatial organization of each population and the intestineâ€™s peristaltic activity. As a result, one species dominates while the other experiences sudden drops in abundance, the dynamics of which are predicted by a stochastic mathematical model. From this work, we conclude that the composition of indigenous microbial communities may, in part, be shaped by a combination of the physical intestinal environment and the spatial structure of bacterial populations.
