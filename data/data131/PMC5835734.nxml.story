 = 28) were visited in 2014 to 2015, and nasal swabs from 43 pig farmers and 56 pigs, as well as 27 air samples taken in the vicinity of the pig enclosures, were collected. As controls, nasal swabs from 17 cow farmers and 26 non-animal-exposed individuals were also included. Analyses of the microbiota were performed based on 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing and the DADA2 pipeline to define sequence variants (SVs). We found that pig farming is strongly associated with specific microbial signatures (including alpha- and beta-diversity), which are reflected in the microbiota of the human nose. Furthermore, the microbial communities were more similar within the same farm compared to between the different farms, indicating a specific microbiota pattern for each pig farm. In total, there were 82 SVs that occurred significantly more abundantly in samples from pig farms than from cow farmers and nonexposed individuals (i.e., the core pig farm microbiota). Of these, nine SVs were significantly associated with the posterior part of the human nose. The results strongly indicate that pig farming is associated with a distinct human nose microbiota. Finally, the community structures derived by the DADA2 pipeline showed an excellent agreement with the outputs of the mothur pipeline which was revealed by procrustes analyses.
