In spite of the amount of literature demonstrating the relationship between upper and lower airways, both from the anatomical, and pathophysiological point of view, little is known about the epidemiology, diagnosis and treatment of the Rhino-Bronchial Syndrome (RBS). After the publication, in 2003, of a Consensus Report defining the Rhino-Bronchial Syndrome, an interdisciplinary group of experts made up from the Italian ENT Society (SIO) and the Interdisciplinary Scientific Association for the Study of Respiratory Diseases (AIMAR) met again in 2005 in order to study a protocol which would have, as the main tasks, the analysis of RBS signs and symptoms and standardization of the diagnostic approach. A secondary endpoint was to characterize the most effective therapeutic options and to correct the great dyshomogeneity in the therapeutic approaches. With this aim, 9 ENT and Pneumology Centres were selected, based on the ability to multidisciplinary cooperation, availability of useful instrumentation and homogeneous distribution over the entire National territory. Overall, 159 patients were enrolled according to clinical history (major and minor symptoms of upper and lower airways) and inclusion/exclusion criteria. All underwent a two level diagnostic approach. In 116 patients, the diagnosis was confirmed on the basis of I level (rhinopharyngeal endoscopy and basal spirometry, respectively, for upper and lower airways) examination. Allergic and infectious diseases were significantly more frequent (37.9% vs 20.9% and 73.3% vs 46.55, respectively) in patients with a confirmed diagnosis for Rhino-Bronchial Syndrome. Nasal obstruction (93%), rhinorrhoea (75%), cough (96%) and dyspnoea (69%) were the more frequent symptoms. The presence of meatal secretions or polyps were the clinical findings significantly differing at endoscopy in the two groups. After 3 months of treatment, according to "good clinical practice" (inhaled steroids, antibiotics, nasal lavages), 96% of the patients recovered. On the basis of these results, a diagnostic flow-chart is proposed according to which the persistence of some symptoms (cough, dyspnoea, rhinorrhoea and nasal obstruction) should lead the patient to a multidisciplinary and multi-level diagnostic approach by an otorhinolaryngology and a pneumology specialist working together for a definitive diagnosis. The recovery rate of about 94% of patients after 3 months of treatment, stresses the importance of a correct diagnosis.
