Patients with lesions in the front part of the brain’s frontal lobe—the prefrontal cortex—suffer from severe memory deficits. Neuroimaging and neurophysiology studies have revealed that multiple areas in the prefrontal cortex are activated during a specific memory task. However, the severity of the memory deficit after a lesion in the prefrontal cortex largely depends on which of the activated areas is damaged; lesions in only a fraction of the activated areas actually lead to memory deficits. It is currently unknown why some activated areas are “lesion effective” and others are not. Here, by using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to measure macaque whole-brain activity during a memory task, we found that the activated areas and the task-specific functional connectivity among them formed a hierarchical network centered on a hub. The task-specific “functional hub” in this dynamic network accurately corresponds to the well-documented lesion-effective site and avoids the neighboring non-lesion-effective sites. Quantitatively, the predicted severity of memory impairment is proportional to the network “hubness” of the lesioned area in the functional network, rather than in the anatomical network, which is statically determined by axonal projection patterns. Our results suggest that the areas of the prefrontal cortex dynamically shape a hub-centric network, reallocating the lesion-effective site apart from the static anatomical hubs depending on the cognitive requirements of the specific memory task.
