In the course of normal cellular functions, many types of reactive oxygen species are produced that can lead to oxidative damage in the cell. DNA bases are subject to the formation of various oxidative lesions; one of the most common is the production of 8-oxoG which can pair relatively well with A instead of C, leading to GC→TA transversion mutations. In this work, we have been able to place a single 8-oxoG in the yeast chromosome and observe its replication. We find that in a wild-type cell its replication is surprisingly accurate due primarily to two components: DNA mismatch repair, which recognizes an A inserted opposite the 8-oxoG and initiates its removal and subsequent re-replication; and translesion synthesis in which the existence of the 8-oxoG induces a switch from a normal replicating DNA polymerase to a specialized DNA polymerase, Pol η, that can accurately replicate an 8-oxoG. We also find that the 8-oxoG can cause the replicating strand to shift to the newly replicated strand in the sister chromatid, thus avoiding the 8-oxoG lesion. These findings indicate not only how cells deal with a known DNA lesion, but also demonstrate how other such lesions can be studied in the future.
