A 75-year-old female underwent esophagogastroduodenoscopy, revealing a widely spreading tumor occupying the anterior wall, lesser curvature, and posterior wall of the antrum and lower body. Endoscopic submucosal dissection was performed and resulted in more than five-sixths circumferential antral mucosal resection. One month later, she complained of nausea, vomiting, and abdominal distention. Endoscopy showed residual food in the stomach and deformation of the antrum with traction toward the contracted scar in the lesser curvature. The pyloric ring could not be seen from the antrum although the endoscope was able to pass easily beyond the area of deformation and the pyloric ring was intact. Despite repeated endoscopic balloon dilations, the patient’s symptoms remained refractory. The problem was speculated to be not due to any potential stricture but to antrum deformation resulting from the traction force toward the healing ulcer. We hypothesized that an additional countertraction force opposite the previous ESD site might resolve the problem, and ESD of approximately 2.5 cm size was performed in the greater curvature of the antrum. Along with development of a scar, traction toward the greater curvature was added, and the pyloric ring could be observed on repeat esophagogastroduodenoscopy. The symptoms were also gradually ameliorated. Afterwards, the endoscopic findings have now been unchanged during 7 years of follow-up.
