Sensory receptors can adjust their sensitivity to continuously varying stimuli, a process known as adaptation. Adaptation has been extensively studied in vision, hearing, and olfactory systems, but whether it also occurs to pain receptors has not been established. TRPV1 is an ion channel expressed in peripheral nerve terminals and is responsible for detection of pain-producing stimuli such as heat, acids, and irritant chemicals (e.g., capsaicin, the hot ingredient of chili peppers). We showed here that the channel has essential properties for adaptation since prolonged activation and calcium influx through the channel resulted in a dramatic decrease in sensitivity to further activation without reducing the maximal possible response of the channel. To address the mechanisms we simultaneously measured channel responsiveness and a component of the plasma membrane called PIP2 whose depletion may underlie desensitization. We showed that the depletion of PIP2 both had a time course synchronous to current desensitization and reached an extent adequate for significantly altering channel responsiveness, suggesting this process mediates the adaptation of TRPV1 channels. We postulate that adaptation is an important feature of pain receptors and may contribute to plasticity of pain sensation.
