. The disease is highly endemic in western China, especially in Tibetan areas, because of poor economic development and hygiene conditions, limited community knowledge of CE, a large scale of dogs, and home slaughtering of livestock. Although many researchers have analyzed risk factors of CE transmission in Tibetan Plateau, there are rare reports of knowledge, attitude, and practice (KAP) of residents about CE in Tibetan communities. In our current study, community based cross-sectional study was conducted in three townships in Xiahe County, Gannan Tibetan Autonomous Prefectures of Gansu Province from May to September 2013. A total of 972 participants originating from Tibetan communities of 31 villages in the 3 townships were registered and data were collected using structured questionnaires. From the total of 972 study participants (457 males and 515 females), 65.9% heard of the disease CE. Most of them (96.1%) would like to accept CE inspection. About half of the peoples feed their dogs often and major of them do not play with the dogs. Risk factors included resident, knowing dog could be infected, knowing eating could be route of infection, oldest dog's age, usually feed your dog by self, feed dogs with internal organs. In general our findings showed that most of residents had positive attitude toward treatments of the disease, but their practice about disease prevention and control was low. Therefore, our study called for continued and strengthened education of changing the life style, especially the behaviors related to dogs.
