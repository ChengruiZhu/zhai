The aim of this study was to determine the beneficial effect of glycyrrhizic acid (GA) on type 2 diabetic nephropathy using renal tubular epithelial cell line (NRK-52E). The cells are divided into normal group (NG), high glucose group (HG), and treatment group (HG + GA). The methylthiazoletetrazolium (MTT) assay was used to detect the cell proliferation. Cell cycle analysis was performed using flow cytometry. Model driven architecture (MDA), reactive oxygen species (ROS) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) were also measured. Electron microscopy and histological were used to detect the changes in cell ultrastructure. The phosphorylation of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), silent information regulator T1 (SIRT1), manganese-superoxide dismutase (Mn-SOD) and transforming growth factor-β1 (TGF-β1) were assessed by immunohistochemistry, immunofluorescence, and western blotting. Real-time fluorescent quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) was used to measure Mn-SOD and PPARγ co-activator 1α (PGC-1a) mRNA. We find that high glucose increases NRK-52E cell proliferation and TGF-β1 expression, but decreases expression of AMPK, SIRT1 and Mn-SOD. These effects are significantly attenuated by GA. Our findings suggest that GA has protective effects against high glucose-induced cell proliferation and oxidative stress at least in part by increasing AMPK, SIRT1 and Mn-SOD expression in NRK-52E cells.
