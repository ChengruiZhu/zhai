Small interfering RNA (siRNA) molecules have significant therapeutic promise for the genetic treatment of cancer. To overcome instability and low transfection efficiency, polyethylene glycol-polyethyleneimine (PEG-PEI) was synthesized and investigated as a non-viral carrier of siRNA targeting CD44v6 in gastric carcinoma cells. The size, surface charge using zeta potential, and morphology via scanning electron microscopy (SEM) of PEG-PEI/siRNA nanoparticles was characterized, and their cytotoxicity, transfection efficiency, and interaction with SGC7901 human gastric carcinoma cells was evaluated. The transfection efficiency of PEG-PEI/siRNA nanocomplexes was dependant on the charge ratio between amino groups of PEG-PEI and phosphate groups of siRNA (N/P) values, which reflected the molar ratio of PEG-PEI to siRNA during complex formation. The transfection efficiency of PEG-PEI/siRNA at N/P 15 was 72.53% Â± 2.38%, which was higher than that observed using Lipofectamine 2000 and PEI as delivery carriers. Cytotoxicity of PEG-PEI was determined by MTT (3-[4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl]-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide) assay and was obviously lower than that of PEI. Moreover, when N/P was below 15, PEG-PEI/siRNA was less toxic than Lipofectamine 2000/siRNA. RT-PCR (real time polymerase chain reaction) and Western blot analyses of CD44v6 expression demonstrated the gene silencing effect of PEG-PEI/siRNA at N/P 15. These data indicate that PEG-PEI may be a promising non-viral carrier for altering gene expression in the treatment of gastric cancer with many advantages, such as relatively high gene transfection efficiency and low cytotoxicity.
