In the current era of cancer research, stimulated by the release of the entire human genome, it has become increasingly clear that to understand cancer we need to understand how the many thousands of genes and proteins involved interact. Modern techniques have enabled the collection of unprecedented amounts of high quality data describing the state of these molecules during cancer development. In cancer research particularly, this strategy has been particularly successful, leading to the discovery of new drugs able to target key factors promoting cancer growth. However, a large body of research suggests that in complex organs, the interaction between cancer and its surrounding environment is an essential part of the biology of both diseased and healthy tissues, therefore it is of paramount importance that this process is further investigated. Here we report a strategy designed to reveal communication signals between cancer cells and adjacent cell types. We apply the strategy to prostate cancer and find that normal cells surrounding the tumour do exert an anti-tumour activity on prostate cancer cells. By using a statistical model which integrates multiple levels of genetic data, we show that cell-to-cell communication genes are controlled by DNA alterations and have potential prognostic value.
