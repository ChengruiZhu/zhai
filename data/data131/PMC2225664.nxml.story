 The effect of intracellular current pulses on the membrane of smooth muscle cells of the guinea pig vas deferens at rest and during transmission was studied. Two main response types were identified: active response cells, in which a spike was initiated in response to depolarizing currents of sufficient strength and duration; passive response cells, in which depolarizing currents gave only electrotonic potential changes. These cells were three times more numerous than the active response cells. During the crest of the active response the input resistance fell by about 25% of the resting value. Comparison of the active response with the action potential due to stimulating the hypogastric nerve showed that the former was smaller in amplitude and had a slower rate of rise and higher threshold. Electrical coupling occurred between the smooth muscle cells during the propagation of the action potential. Depolarizing current pulses had no effect on the amplitude of the excitatory junction potential (E.J.P.) in passive response cells, but in general did decrease its amplitude in active response cells. These results are discussed with respect to the mechanism of autonomic neuroeffector transmission.
