 An active substance has been detected, by the methods described, in five patients in early stages of epidemic influenza during 1918â€“19 and two patients in early stages of epidemic influenza during 1920 It was not detected in twelve cases of the same disease in which the onset of obvious symptoms occurred more than 36 hours before washing of the nasopharynx was carried out, nor was it found in the secretions of fourteen individuals free from the syndrome of influenza either during the epidemics or the interval between them. With this substance a clinical and pathological condition has been induced in rabbits, affecting the blood and pulmonary structures mainly, which could be maintained and carried through at least fifteen successive animals. For this reason, and also because of the dilution between passages, we are led to believe that we were dealing with the actual transmission of a multiplying agent rather than with a passive transference of an original active substance. In some of the experiments secondary infections by ordinary bacteria were encountered. The relation of these microorganisms to this active substance will be dealt with fully in another communication. However, the essential effects were produced by a substance wholly unrelated to these bacteria. The similarity that exists between the effects produced in rabbits on the blood and the lungs and those occurring in man in epidemic influenza provides a basis for further investigation on the inciting agent of epidemic influenza.
