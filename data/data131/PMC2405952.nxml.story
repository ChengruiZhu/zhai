A neuron cell is composed of cell body, axons, and dendrites. Dendritic spines on dendrites form synapses with axons of other neurons, establishing communication between neuron cells. Dendrite development and synapse formation are therefore important for neuronal function. Although many genes have been previously identified as affecting the development of dendrites and synapses, the apoptosis Bcl-2 family members have not yet been shown to regulate these processes. In this study, a Bcl-2 family survival member, Bcl-w, was found not to affect cell death, but to be required for synapse formation and motor learning in mouse cerebellum. Bcl-w also appears to control dendrite development as double null mutant mice of Bcl-w and the glutamate receptor Î´2 (Grid2) have severe defects in Purkinje cell dendrites, spines, and synapses. In addition, Bcl-w and Grid2 act synergistically to promote what is likely to be mitochondrial fission in Purkinje cells. Neither the survival members of the Bcl-2 family nor the excitatory receptors have been demonstrated previously to regulate mitochondrial morphogenesis in brain. We conclude that neuronal dendrite development and synapse formation require perhaps mitochondrial fission that can be controlled by two critical pathways including Bcl-w and Grid2.
