Human impact currently induces rapid reductions in global biodiversity. Assessing the consequences of such modifications requires that ecological science better understand the conditions under which the species in a community can coexist and when not. Fundamentally, two species can not coexist indefinitely when they exclusively compete for the same prey—one must inevitably become extinct. This paradigm is known as the competitive exclusion principle. We consider communities of any number of species and multiple trophic levels, i.e. the average number of steps between a predator and basic nutrient, e.g. sunlight or sugars. We show that the extension of the competitive exclusion principle to such large systems means that each species must be part of a “non-overlapping pairing”. Such pairings are exclusive connections between two species, e.g. a predator and a prey. We demonstrate that a stable food web can always be obtained if a non-overlapping pairing exists. The food web assembly rules are explicit conditions that specify sustainable combinations of species at the different trophic levels. As also seen in field data, our rules imply high species numbers at intermediate levels and few at the top and bottom. We further show that omnivorous species—those with hosts at multiple trophic levels—may take a special role in stabilizing food webs, as they combine several trophic levels.
