In human cells, there are eleven subtypes of linker histones, five (H1.1â€“H1.5) of which are ubiquitously expressed in somatic cells. Somatic linker histones have been thought of as a group of similar proteins with redundant functions with few known differences among them. Our work uncovers for the first time a novel and unique role for the linker histone H1.5 (HIST1H1B). We found that H1.5, but not H1.3 (HIST1H1D), forms blocks of chromatin binding in genic and intergenic regions in differentiated human cells from all germ layers but not in embryonic stem cells. In genic regions, H1.5 binds to a large fraction of gene families that encode membrane associated proteins and are transcriptionally silent in a tissue-specific manner. H1.5 binding is associated with other repressive chromatin elements such as SIRT1 binding and H3K9me2 enrichment, and it negatively correlates with Pol II distribution. SIRT1 and H3K9me2 binding is dependent on H1.5, but not vice versa. H1.5 depletion in fibroblasts leads to increased chromatin accessibility at its target loci, altered cell cycle, and deregulation of gene expression. Our findings show that H1.5 has a dynamic distribution during human cell differentiation and is required for maintenance of proper gene expression in differentiated cells.
