Adhesion of leukocytes to endothelial cells plays an important role in neuroinflammation. Therefore, suppression of the expression of adhesion molecules in brain endothelial cells may inhibit neuroinflammation. Chrysin (5,7-dihydroxyflavone) is a flavonoid component of propolis, blue passion flowers, and fruits. In the present study, we examined the effects of chrysin on lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced expression of vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1) in mouse cerebral vascular endothelial (bEnd.3) cells. In bEnd.3 cells, LPS increased mRNA expression of VCAM-1 in a time-dependent manner, and chrysin significantly decreased LPS-induced mRNA expression of VCAM-1. Chrysin also reduced VCAM-1 protein expression in a concentration-dependent manner. Furthermore, chrysin blocked adhesion of monocytes to bEnd.3 cells exposed to LPS. Nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB), p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), and c-Jun N-terminal kinase, which are all activated by LPS, were significantly inhibited by chrysin. These results indicate that chrysin inhibits the expression of VCAM-1 in brain endothelial cells by inhibiting NF-κB translocation and MAPK signaling, resulting in the attenuation of leukocyte adhesion to endothelial cells. The anti-inflammatory effects of chrysin suggest a possible therapeutic application of this agent to neurodegenerative diseases, such as multiple sclerosis, septic encephalopathy, and allergic encephalomyelitis.
