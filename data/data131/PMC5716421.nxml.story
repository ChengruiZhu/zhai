Volumetric‐modulated arc therapy (VMAT) has been shown to be able to deliver plans equivalent to intensity‐modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) in a fraction of the treatment time. This improvement is important for patient immobilization/ localization compliance due to comfort and treatment duration, as well as patient throughput. Previous authors have suggested commissioning methods for this modality. Here, we extend the methods reported for the Varian RapidArc system (which tested individual system components) to the Elekta linear accelerator, using custom files built using the Elekta iComCAT software. We also extend the method reported for VMAT commissioning of the Elekta accelerator by verifying maximum values of parameters (gantry speed, multileaf collimator (MLC) speed, and backup jaw speed), investigating: 1) beam profiles as a function of dose rate during an arc, 2) over/under dosing due to MLC reversals, and 3) over/under dosing at changing dose rate junctions. Equations for construction of the iComCAT files are given. Results indicate that the beam profile for lower dose rates varies less than 3% from that of the maximum dose rate, with no difference during an arc. The gantry, MLC, and backup jaw maximum speed are internally consistent. The monitor unit chamber is stable over the MUs and gantry movement conditions expected. MLC movement and position during VMAT delivery are within IMRT tolerances. Dose rate, gantry speed, and MLC speed are accurately controlled. Over/under dosing at junctions of MLC reversals or dose rate changes are within clinical acceptability.
