We have previously demonstrated the use of Eclipse fluence optimization to define aperture sizes for a novel aperture modulated translating bed total body irradiation (TBI) technique. The purposes of the present study were to identify, characterize, and correct for sources of error inherent in our previous fluence optimization technique, and to develop a clinically viable fluence optimization module for the translating bed TBI technique. Aperture modulated TBI is delivered by translating the patient at constant speed on a custom bed under a modulated radiation beam. The patient is then turned from supine to prone and the process repeated, resulting in an AP‐PA treatment. Radiological depths were calculated along divergent ray lines through individual CT slices of a RANDO phantom. Beam apertures, defined using a dynamic multileaf collimator (DMLC), were generated using calculated radiological depths and calibration factors that relate fluence to aperture size in a dynamic environment. These apertures were defined every 9 mm along the phantom superior‐inferior axis. The calculated beam apertures were further modified to account for scatter within the patient. For dose calculation purposes the individual MLC files were imported into Eclipse. For treatment delivery, dynamic MLC files for both AP and PA beams were generated and delivered dynamically. Dose homogeneity in the head and neck region of the RANDO phantom was within
