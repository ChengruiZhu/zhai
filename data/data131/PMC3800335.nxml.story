An electrical storm is usually associated with catecholaminergic surge following myocardial ischaemia and manifest as recurrent ventricular arrhythmias, requiring frequent DC shocks. Delivering repeated DC shocks induces myocardial damage and further worsens the arrhythmias, which are resistant to the antiarrhythmic drugs. Cardiac sympathetic blockade abates the excessive catecholaminergic drive and help pacifying the malignant ventricular arrhythmias. We treated the electrical storm in a 52-year-old male with ultrasound-guided left sympathetic ganglion block followed by surgical left cardiac sympathetic denervation. The patient remained symptom-free without any incident of ventricular arrhythmias for 8 months after the surgery. The ultrasonography during blockade of the stellate ganglion enhances the success rate of the technique, reduces the quantity of local anaesthetic required to produce desired effects and prevents technical complications. Supraclavicular surgical access to the upper thoracic sympathetic chain obviates the necessity for one lung ventilation and lateral decubitus during surgery, when the patient is in hemodynamically unstable condition. Sympathectomy can be performed under general anaesthesia taking cautions to avoid sympathetic stimulation in intraoperative period.
