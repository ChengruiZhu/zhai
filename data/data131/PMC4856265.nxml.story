Trees have long formed in biology the basic structure with which to represent and understand evolutionary relationships. Mathematical models, computational methods, and software tools for inferring phylogenetic trees and studying their mathematical properties are currently the norm in biology. The availability of genomic data from closely related species, as well as from multiple individuals within species, have brought the two fields of phylogenetics and population genetics closer than ever. In particular, the last two decades have witnessed a great flourish in the development and implementation of phylogenetic methods based on the multispecies coalescent model to capture the intricate relationship between gene and genome evolution. However, when reticulation processes such as hybridization occur, the phylogenetic history is best represented by a network. In this work, we demonstrate how the multispecies coalescent model can be adapted to reticulate evolutionary histories and report on a Bayesian method for inference of such histories under this extended model. As networks subsume trees, the model and method provide a principled and unified statistical framework for inferring treelike and non-treelike evolutionary relationships.
