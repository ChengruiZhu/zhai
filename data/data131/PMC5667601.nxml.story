Sauna has become a popular club house facility where the dweller enjoys relaxation. Some exercise groups like yoga and Qigong practitioners, are making use of the heated environment to achieve quicker and better results of trainings. Sauna therapy is producing a thermal stress through hyperthermia. The cardiovascular system readily responds by increasing the heart rate which can become double the resting stage within minutes and cardiac output may have a 70% increase. The body’s surface response to heat leads to a 40% of decrease in peripheral vascular resistance, thus allowing rapid peripheral blood flow which is responsible for greater heat dispersal directly from the skin. The chained physiological reactions of increased cardiac and pulmonary outputs, while blood pressure drops suggest that Sauna could be good for chronic diseases. When active stretching are executed simultaneously with controlled breathing in a smooth synchronized chain of activities under the individual’s free will, a harmonized state of mind reaching the level of meditation follows. Sauna room environment initiates a physiological stat equivalent to moderate exercises. Qigong practice is typical anaerobic training. Both Sauna and Qigong lead to a tranquility of the mind. The unique nature of practicing Qigong in a heated environment is therefore clear. A small pilot study on Qigong practice within the Sauna room showed a higher increase in heart rate which amounted to 30%–40% above the pre-exercise level. The blood pressure checked after Qigong, on the contrary, remained stable or even slightly decreased.
