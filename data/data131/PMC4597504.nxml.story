Forty-two skeletally immature athletes (mean chronologic age 12.7 yrs, [range 10-15]) were prospectively evaluated following an all-inside ACL reconstruction utilizing hamstring autograft. The mean bone age (Greulich and Pyle method) was 13.5 years. There were 10 females and 32 males. Twenty-six patients had an all-epiphyseal (AE) ACL reconstruction and 16 patients had a partial transphyseal (PTP) ACL reconstruction, which spared the femoral physis but crossed the tibial physis. The PTP option was reserved for patients with minimal proximal tibial growth remaining. Fourteen athletes were involved in recreational sport and 28 participated competitively. Lacrosse (36%) and Soccer (32%) were the two most common sports associated with ACL injury in our cohort. All athletes were evaluated with a physical examination, KT-1000 arthrometry, isokinetic testing, validated outcome scores including the International Knee Documentation Committee score (IKDC), the Lysholm score and Marx activity rating scale. Standing radiographs and SPGR MRI analysis was performed at 6, 12 and 24 months post-op depending upon skeletal age. A ‘Return to Play’ performance analysis was also performed where symmetry, alignment control and the ability to decelerate were assessed during progressively challenging movement patterns encountered in sport.
