The present study aimed to investigate the effects of flurbiprofen on serum level of interleukin-6 (IL-6), prostacyclin (PGI2) and corticosteroid A2 (TXA2) in patients with bone metastases of cancer. A total of 210 patients with bone metastasis of cancer were randomly divided into two groups: Flurbiprofen axetil analgesia group (group A) and dezocine analgesia group (group B), 105 cases in each group. The analgesic effect was evaluated using visual analogue scale (VAS) scoring system at 1, 12, 24 and 48 h after treatment. Serum levels of IL-6, PGI2 and TXA2 at 12 and 24 h after treatment were detected using double-antibody sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. No significant differences in VAS scores were found between the two groups at 1, 12, 24 and 48 h after treatment, and no gastrointestinal adverse events and abnormal bleeding were observed. No significant differences in the serum levels of IL-6 were found between the two groups at 12 and 24 h after treatment. Significantly lower serum levels of TXA2 and PGI2 were found in group A compared to group B at 12 and 24 h after treatment (P<0.05). Serum level of PGI2 was positively correlated with serum level of TXA2 (r=0.7212, P<0.05) and VAS score (r=0.7159, P<0.05). Serum level of IL-6 was positively correlated with VAS score (r=0.7997, P<0.05). The results show that flurbiprofen axetil can effectively relieve pain in patients with bone metastases of cancer, can inhibit platelet activation, adhesion and aggregation, and reduce the formation of deep vein thrombosis, and can inhibit stress response and inflammatory response in the body.
