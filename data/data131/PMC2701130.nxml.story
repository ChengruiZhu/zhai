The prognosis of some of the most prevalent conditions seems to be intricately related to myriad risk factors, largely modifiable, but often leading to irreversible complications when left unmanaged. This study exemplifies the multidisciplinary approach necessary, to successfully control diabetic retinopathy, one of the leading complications of diabetes, and to discuss promising therapies. Based on a Medline Ovid database search, we present a clinical and economic review of the evidence on the epidemiology and risk factors of diabetic retinopathy, its prognosis and economic implications. Among adults aged 20â€“74, diabetic retinopathy (DR) is the most frequent cause of blindness. However, in both types 1 and 2 DM, improved glycemic control reduces the development and progression of DR. Risk factors of DR include duration of diabetes, pregnancy, renal disease, age, smoking, alcohol, hyperlipidemia and antioxidants. A number of drugs may play a role in DR therapy in the coming few years; eg, somatostatin agonists (sandostatin), corticosteroids (triamcinolone, dexamethasone, fluocinolone), vascular endothelial growth factor inhibitors (pegaptanib, ranibizumab), hyaluronidase and plasmin enzyme. Whether these therapies have a clinically significant impact on DR progression however, remains to be seen.
