Recurrence of pterygium is the main concern for ophthalmic surgeons after the excision of pterygium. To evaluate the efficacy and safety of ethanol treatment during pterygium excision in preventing the recurrence of pterygia. A prospective randomized study was performed of 78 eyes in primary pterygium patients treated by excision. Primary pterygium patients were randomly assigned to ethanol group (38 eyes given intraoperative ethanol) or mitomycin-c (MMC) group (40 eyes given intraoperative MMC). Ethanol (20%) was applied for 60 seconds to the pterygial and its adjacent corneal surfaces before pterygium excision. After excision, the excised site of sclera was soaked with 20% Ethanol for 60 seconds. In group 2, MMC (0.25 mg/ml) was applied for 60 seconds to the bare sclera after pterygium excision. The outcomes were followed for more than one year. Pterygium recurred in 2 (5.3%) of 38 eyes in ethanol group and 4 (10.0%) of 40 eyes in MMC group. Final appearance of the pterygium excision area was satisfactory in 73.6% of group1 and 67.5% of group 4. No patients experienced severe complications postoperatively. In comparison with MMC treatment, intraoperative ethanol is more efficacious in preventing recurrence of pterygium and causes fewer complications. It suggests this regimen as an alternative for the treatment of pterygium, especially for those patients of high risk group for MMC treatment complications.
