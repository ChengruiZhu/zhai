Reperfusion may cause intramyocardial hemorrhage (IMH) by extravasation of erythrocytes through severely damaged endothelial walls. The purpose of the study was to evaluate the clinical significance of IMH in relation to infarct size, microvascular obstruction (MVO) and function in patients after primary percutaneous intervention. Forty-five patients underwent cardiovascular MR imaging (CMR) 1 week and 4 months after primary stenting for a first acute myocardial infarction. T2-weighted spin-echo imaging (T2W) was used to assess infarct related edema and IMH, and delayed enhancement (DE) was used to assess infarct size and MVO. Cine CMR was used to assess left ventricular volumes and function at baseline and at 4 months follow-up. In 22 (49%) patients, IMH was detected as areas of attenuated signal in the core of the high signal intensity region on T2W images. Patients with IMH had larger infarcts, higher left ventricular volumes and lower ejection fraction. Contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR) between hyperintense periphery and the hypo-intense core of the T2W ischemic area correlated to peak CKMB, total infarct size and MVO size. Using univariable analysis, CNR predicted ejection fraction at baseline (β = −0.62,
