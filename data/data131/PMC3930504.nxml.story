Zinc is an essential trace element with many biological functions in the body, whose concentrations are tightly regulated by different membrane transporters. Here we report an unusual case of positive natural selection for an amino acid replacement in the human intestinal zinc uptake transporter ZIP4. This substitution is recognized as one of the most strongly differentiated genome-wide polymorphisms among human populations. However, since the extreme population differentiation of this non-synonymous site was not accompanied by additional signatures of natural selection, it was unclear whether it was the result of genetic adaptation. Using computer simulations we demonstrate that such an unusual pattern can be explained by the effect of local recombination, together with positive selection in Sub-Saharan Africa. Moreover, we provide evidence to suggest functional differences between the two ZIP4 isoforms in terms of the transporter cell surface expression and zinc uptake. This result is the first genetic indication that zinc regulation may differ among modern human populations, a finding that may have implications for health research. Further, we speculate that reduced zinc uptake mediated by the derived variant may have been advantageous in Sub-Saharan Africa, possibly by reducing access of a geographically restricted pathogen to this micronutrient.
