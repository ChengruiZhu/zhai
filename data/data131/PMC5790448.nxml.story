The purpose of this study is to evaluate the prompt gamma ray imaging technique according to the clinical boron concentration range during proton boron fusion therapy (PBFT). To acquire a prompt gamma ray image from 32 projections, we simulated four head single photon emission computed tomography and a proton beam nozzle using a Monte Carlo simulation. We used modified ordered subset expectation maximization reconstruction algorithm with a graphic processing unit for fast image acquisition. Boron concentration was set as 20 to 100 μg at intervals of 20 μg. For quantitative analysis of the prompt gamma ray image, we acquired an image profile drawn through two boron uptake regions (BURs) and calculated the contrast value, signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), and difference between the physical target volume and volume of the prompt gamma ray image. The relative counts of prompt gamma rays were noticeably increased with increasing boron concentration. Although the intensities on the image profiles showed a similar tendency according to the boron concentration, the SNR and contrast value were improved with increasing boron concentration. This study suggests that a tumor monitoring technique using prompt gamma ray detection can be clinically applicable even if the boron concentration is relatively low.
