Apoptosis is induced by different stimuli, among them triggering of the death receptor CD95, staurosporine, and chemotherapeutic drugs. In all cases, apoptosis is mediated by caspases, although it is unclear how these diverse apoptotic stimuli cause protease activation. Two regulatory pathways have been recently identified, but it remains unknown whether they are functionally independent or linked to each other. One is mediated by recruitment of the proximal regulator caspase-8 to the death receptor complex. The other pathway is controlled by the release of cytochrome c from mitochondria and the subsequent ATP-dependent activation of the death regulator apoptotic protease-activating factor 1 (Apaf-1). Here, we report that both pathways can be dissected by depletion of intracellular ATP. Prevention of ATP production completely inhibited caspase activation and apoptosis in response to chemotherapeutic drugs and staurosporine. Interestingly, caspase-8, whose function appeared to be restricted to death receptors, was also activated by these drugs under normal conditions, but not after ATP depletion. In contrast, inhibition of ATP production did not affect caspase activation after triggering of CD95. These results suggest that chemotherapeutic drugâ€“induced caspase activation is entirely controlled by a receptor-independent mitochondrial pathway, whereas CD95-induced apoptosis can be regulated by a separate pathway not requiring Apaf-1 function.
