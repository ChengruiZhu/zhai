. For this purpose, we established a mouse xenograft model using KPL-4, a HER2-positive human breast cancer cell line, in which the triple-drug combination treatment dramatically induced tumor regression compared with double-drug combinations (trastuzumab plus docetaxel, pertuzumab plus docetaxel, or pertuzumab plus trastuzumab). Four days after the triple-drug treatment was started, strong reduction in the phosphorylation of HER2, epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), HER3, extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), and AKT in tumor tissues was seen, despite only weak suppression of phosphorylation seen with the single- or double-drug treatments. Histopathological analysis and flow cytometric analysis showed that the triple-drug treatment enhanced apoptosis after mitotic arrest induced by docetaxel. Furthermore, infiltration of mononuclear cells around the tumor cells was strongly induced by the triple-drug combination treatment. These results suggested that the mechanism underlying the synergistic efficacy of the triple-drug combination was attributable, at least in part, to the docetaxel-mediated apoptosis being promoted by enhanced inhibition of HER2-HER3-AKT signaling as well to the intratumor infiltration of mononuclear cells induced by anti-HER2 antibodies being enhanced by docetaxel.
