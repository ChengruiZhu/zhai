The objective of the study was to find the determinants related to not breastfeeding (BF) and others related to the delay in the early initiation of BF in the Mecca region, Saudi Arabia. A cross-sectional study in the Maternity and Children Hospital and primary healthcare centers was performed. A questionnaire was filled by dietitians to 814 asymptomatic Saudi mothers. Determinants related to not BF and the delay in the early initiation of BF were determined by binary logistic regression, and the odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) were determined. Significant factors associated with not BF were not rooming-in infants in the mother’s room (OR: 2.37; 95% CI: 1.66–3.41) and using a pacifier (OR: 1.62; 95% CI: 1.13–2.33). The most significant determinant of the early initiation of BF was the initiation of bottle feeding (OR: 18.16; 95% CI: 10.51–31.4), followed by not rooming-in infants in the mother’s room (OR: 2.2; 95% CI: 1.52–3.18), initiation of partial feeding (OR: 1.89; 95% CI: 1.3–2.74), uninformed mothers regarding the importance of BF (OR: 1.56; 95% CI: 1.04–2.35), and cesarean sections (OR:1.42; 95% CI: 1.02–1.98). Risk factors affecting BF and the early initiation of BF in Mecca City should be highlighted in national campaigns to increase mothers’ awareness and promote BF practice.
