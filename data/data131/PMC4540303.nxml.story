Performance records shows that there was no significant (p > 0.05) difference in feed intake across the supplements of Red pepper, Water leaf, Canthaxanthin and control diet, however, birds fed Baobab leaf treatment had a significantly lower (p < 0.05) feed intake value (94.07 g) when compared with other treatments. Body weight gain and Hen Day Production were not significant influenced (p > 0.05) by the dietary treatments, although laying hens fed Baobab leaf supplement had lowest mean HDP of 48.80%, while birds fed Red pepper and Water leaf supplement had an average value of 52.79%. There was no significant effect (p > 0.05) of colorants on egg external traits, compared with the control; birds fed Canthaxanthin treatment had higher mean egg weight (51.79 g), egg length (4.55 g), egg breadth (3.29 g); Red pepper treatment had highest mean shell thickness (0.29 g), however these differences were not significant (p > 0.05). Yolk height, Albumen height, Yolk index, and Haugh unit were not significantly affected (p > 0.05) across treatments. Yolk width was lowest (p < 0.05) in Baobab leaf treatment (2.54 cm); Red pepper, Water leaf and Canthaxanthin (2.89 cm, 2.62 cm and 2.89 cm respectively) were not significantly (p > 0.05) different from the control (2.73 cm). Yolk colour score was significantly highest (p < 0.05) in Red pepper treatment (7.50); Water leaf, Baobab leaf and Canthaxanthin ranged between 2.25- 3.31 on the DSM yolk colour fan, Control treatment had the lowest yolk colour score (p < 0.05) of 1.31.
