Galectin-3 (Gal-3), a Î²-galactoside-binding protein, has been implicated in cell proliferation, cell adhesion, and the progression and metastasis of various types of cancer. The present study investigated the involvement of Gal-3 in the tumorigenesis and progression of pituitary tumors using three rat pituitary tumor cell lines. Following transfection with Gal-3 expression and interference vectors, the impact of Gal-3 on proliferation, apoptosis and migration of pituitary tumor cells was been investigated. Meanwhile, BCL2 associated X, apoptosis regulator (Bax), caspase-3 and matrix metalloproteinase 7 (MMP7) protein expression levels were analyzed by western blotting. The results of the present study revealed that Gal-3 expression in GH3 and GH4C1 cells was higher than in RC-4B/C cells. Furthermore, Gal-3 was demonstrated to promote the proliferation and migration of GH3 and GH4C1 cells, and inhibit cell apoptosis. Caspase-3 and MMP7 protein expression was also increased by Gal-3, while Bax expression was decreased. These results suggested that Gal-3 serves an important function in the tumorigenesis and development of pituitary tumors, and it may be a useful target for the treatment of pituitary tumors in the future.
