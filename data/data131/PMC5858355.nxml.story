Alzheimer’s disease (AD) shows a marked presence of physiologic changes and the start or aggravation of underlying diseases such as physical frailty in diverse anatomical regions. It is believed to have a particularly harmful effect on the health of the foot. We examined the foot health status in older persons with AD, with a specific focus on the extent to which people with AD may be using inadequate footwear in old age. Seventy-three community-dwelling people with probable, mild to moderate AD aged 65–95 years were recruited from a center of excellence for AD. A single trained physician evaluated health status and foot conditions. Current shoe and foot length and width measurements were taken using a calibrated Brannock device. The results indicate that sixty-five participants (89.04%) suffered from feet problems. Also, only twenty-two subjects (30.14%) used the correct shoes in width and size related with the morphology of their feet. Fifty-one participants (69.86%) were using incorrect shoes in length or width. The present study revealed that peoples with AD had a high presence of foot health problems. Also, the use of inappropriate shoes revealed measurable differences of association between shoe size and the morphology of the foot.
