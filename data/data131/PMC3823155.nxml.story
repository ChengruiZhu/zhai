Antiplatelet agents are a cornerstone in the treatment of acute arterial thrombotic events and in the prevention of thrombus formation. However, existing antiplatelet agents (mainly aspirin, the combination of aspirin and dipyridamole and clopidogrel) reduce the risk of vascular events only by about one quarter compared with placebo. As a consequence, more efficacious antiplatelet therapies with a reduced bleeding risk are needed. We give an overview of several new antiplatelet agents that are currently investigated in secondary stroke prevention: adenosine 5′-diphosphonate receptor antagonists, cilostazol, sarpogrelate, terutroban and SCH 530348. There are unique features in secondary stroke prevention that have to be taken into account: ischaemic stroke is a heterogeneous disease caused by multiple aetiologies and the blood–brain barrier is disturbed after stroke which may result in a higher intracerebral bleeding risk. Several small randomized trials indicated that the combination of aspirin and clopidogrel might be superior to antiplatelet monotherapy in the acute and early post-ischaemic phase. There is an ongoing debate about antiplatelet resistance. Decreasing response to aspirin is correlated independently with an increased risk of cardiovascular events. However, there is still no evidence from randomized trials linking aspirin resistance and recurrent ischaemic events. Similarly, randomized trials have not demonstrated a clinical significantly decreased antiplatelet effect by the concomitant use of clopidogrel and proton pump inhibitors. Nevertheless, a routine use of this drug combination is not recommended.
