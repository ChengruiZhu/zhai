]. Differentiation markers that are frequently changed in early invasive carcinoma are also changed in PIN lesions. In this study, prostate tissue samples obtained during surgical operation and classified as various disease states (inflammation, PIN lesions, and cancer) were examined. The samples were measured by means of microbeam synchrotron-radiation-induced X-ray emission (micro-SRIXE). Special attention was paid to examine the relationship between the earlier-mentioned disorders and changes in relative concentrations of S, K, Ca, Fe, Cu, and Zn. Applying the image-processing program ImageJ enabled us to select the areas of interest from two-dimensional maps of various prostate samples according to the histopathologistâ€™s evaluation. Detailed analysis of micro-SRIXE spectra based on multivariate methods shows significant differences between elemental concentrations in inflammatory cells, PIN lesions, and cancerous tissues, which confirms that this method can be used to distinguish various pathological states in prostate tissues. Information obtained in this way may provide better understanding of the biochemistry of unhealthy prostate tissues, thus opening the way to find new medicines/treatments to prevent or slow down some harmful intracellular processes.
