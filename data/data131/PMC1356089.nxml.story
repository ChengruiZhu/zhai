One of the central questions of molecular biology is to understand how signals are transduced in the cell. Intracellular signal transduction is mainly achieved through cascades of protein-protein interactions, which are often mediated by peptide-binding modular domains, such as Src Homology 2 and 3 (SH2 and SH3). Each family of these domains binds to peptides with specific sequence and structural characteristics. To reconstruct the protein-protein interaction networks mediated by modular domains, one must identify the peptide motifs recognized by these domains and understand the mechanism of binding specificity. These questions are challenging because the domain-peptide interactions are usually weak and transient. Here, the authors took a physical-principles approach to address these difficult questions for the SH3 domain of human protein Abl, which binds to peptides containing the PXXP motif (where P is proline and X is any amino acid). They generated a position-specific scoring matrix to represent the binding motif of the Abl SH3 domain. Analysis on the binding free energy components suggested insights into how the binding specificity is achieved. Most known protein interacting partners of the Abl SH3 domain were correctly identified using the position-specific scoring matrix, and other potential interacting partners were also suggested.
