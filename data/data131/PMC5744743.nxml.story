The RNASEL –1385G/A (rs486907) variant has been reported to be associated with increased risk of prostate cancer. However, these associations are not consistent among studies. To address this issue, we performed a meta-analysis to evaluate the association between RNASEL –1385G/A polymorphism and prostate cancer risk. The PubMed, Embase, and Web of Science databases were searched for relevant papers published in the past 20 years from 1997 to 2017. Odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were used to assess the strength of associations. Based on our search for manuscripts reporting prostate cancer susceptibility related to the rs486907 polymorphism, 16 case–control studies from 13 different publications were retrieved. No significantly positive associations were found for the polymorphism and prostate cancer susceptibility in the total population. When stratified by ethnicity, the results demonstrated that the –1385G/A polymorphism was associated with a decreased cancer risk in Africans (GG vs AA: OR =0.371, 95% CI =0.176–0.783; GG/GA vs AA: OR =0.368, 95% CI =0.175–0.776). We also found that the rs486907 polymorphism was associated with a decreased cancer risk in hospital-based controls (GG vs AA: OR =0.697, 95% CI =0.488–0.996; GG + GA vs AA: OR =0.701, 95% CI =0.502–0.978). Our meta-analysis suggests that polymorphism in the RNASEL gene is a protective factor against prostate cancer in Africans. Further studies using larger sample sizes should be conducted to elucidate the role of gene polymorphism in prostate cancer risk.
