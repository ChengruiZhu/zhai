The present study analysed changes in the distribution pattern of cocaine- and amphetamine-regulated transcript (CART) in the enteric nervous system (ENS) of the human colon challenged by adenocarcinoma invasion, using the double-labelling immunofluorescence technique. In control specimens, CART immunoreactivity was found in neurons of all studied plexuses, representing 30.1 ± 4.1%, 12.9 ± 5.2%, and 4.1 ± 1.3% of all neurons forming the myenteric plexus (MP), outer submucous plexus (OSP), and inner submucous plexus (ISP), respectively. Tumour growth into the colon wall caused an increase in the relative frequency of CART-like immunoreactive (CART-LI) neurons in enteric plexuses located in the vicinity of the infiltrating neoplasm (to 36.1 ± 6.7%, 32.7 ± 7.3% and 12.1 ± 3.8% of all neurons in MP, OSP and ISP, respectively). The density of CART-LI nerves within particular layers of the intestinal wall did not differ between control and adenocarcinoma-affected areas of the human colon. This is the first detailed description of the CART distribution pattern within the ENS during the adenocarcinoma invasion of the human colon wall. The obtained results suggest that CART probably acts as a neuroprotective factor and may be involved in neuronal plasticity evoked by the progression of a neoplastic process.
