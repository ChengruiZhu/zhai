The mechanisms eliciting colorectal adenocarcinoma are not well understood and the FBXL20 gene is problematic as it exhibits an abnormal expression in colorectal cancer cells. In the present study a recombinant plasmid, pReceiver-M03-FBL20 expression plasmid was constructed, which overexpressed FBXL20; this was transfected into Lovo cells to form Lovo-FBL20 cells. The FBXL20 expression level was examined by quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) and western blot analysis. The cell viability and invasion capacity were measured using cell counting kit 8, Transwell chamber and wound healing assays, respectively. The associated genes, including E-cadherin, β-catenin, c-Myc, SET nuclear oncogene, protein phosphatase-2A, Axin, p53 and caspase 3, were detected by qPCR and western blotting. It was demonstrated that the FBXL20 expression level was markedly upregulated in the Lovo-FBL20 cells transfected with pReceiver-M03-FBL20 expression plasmid, compared with that of the Lovo cells. In addition, the cell viability and invasion capacity of the Lovo-FBL20 cells were significantly increased. These increases correlated with a significant upregulation in the expression level of β-catenin and c-Myc, and a downregulated expression level of E-cadherin. The results of the present study indicate that FBXL20 may mediate the ubiquitin degradation of E-cadherin resulting in an increased invasive ability of malignant cells.
