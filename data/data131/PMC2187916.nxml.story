Freshly isolated 2-h adherent normal human monocytes, when stimulated, degrade added leukotriene C4 (LTC4) by a myeloperoxidase (MPO) and H2O2- dependent mechanism. Among the stimuli effective in this regard are phorbol myristate acetate (PMA), the calcium ionophore A23187, opsonized zymosan, and N-formyl-methionine-leucine-phenylalanine (FMLP) when combined with cytochalasin B. The predominant products formed are the all-trans isomers of LTB4, 5-(S), 12-(R)-6-trans-LTB4 and 5-(S),12- (S)-6-trans-LTB4. Degradation is inhibited by azide and catalase, but not by superoxide dismutase. LTC4 degradation does not occur when MPO- deficient monocytes are used, unless MPO is added. Stimulated monocytes from patients with chronic granulomatous disease also are unable to degrade LTC4 under these conditions. Normal monocytes maintained in culture lose their ability to degrade LTC4. The addition of MPO to monocyte-derived macrophages increases degradation, particularly when the monolayers are pretreated with gamma-interferon. The oxidative degradation of LTC4 is a capacity shared by neutrophils, eosinophils, and mononuclear phagocytes, and may be an important mechanism for the modulation of leukotriene activity in inflammatory lesions.
