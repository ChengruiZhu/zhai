The office SBP showed a significant decrease after 6 and 12 months of sitagliptin therapy (P < 0.01 and P < 0.01, respectively), while office DBP was decreased significantly at all time points of evaluation (3, 6, 9, and 12 months: P < 0.05, P < 0.001, P < 0.001, and P < 0.05, respectively). Analysis of covariance revealed a significant decrease in office SBP after 6 and 12 months, as well as significant reduction of office DBP after 6 and 9 months. Morning home SBP and DBP were significantly reduced after 6 months, as was evening home DBP after 6 and 12 months, but there was no significant decrease in evening home SBP. HbA1c and plasma glucose levels were significantly reduced at all time points of evaluation. Examination of the lipid profile revealed that total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and triglycerides were also decreased at all time points of evaluation, while high-density lipoprotein cholesterol was significantly reduced after 3, 9, and 12 months. Significant reduction of the estimated glomerular filtration rate was observed after 6, 9, and 12 months, and the urinary albumin/creatinine ratio was significantly lower at 9 and 12 months. Serum creatinine was increased significantly at all time points of evaluation.
