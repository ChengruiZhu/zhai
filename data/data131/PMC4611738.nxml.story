The increased mitochondrial DNA damage leads to altered functional capacities of retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) cells. A previous study showed the increased autophagy in RPE cells caused by low concentrations of rotenone, a selective inhibitor of mitochondrial complex I. However, the mechanism by which autophagy regulates RPE cell death is still unclear. In the present study, we examined the mechanism underlying the regulation of RPE cell death through the inhibition of mitochondrial complex I. We report herein that rotenone induced mitotic catastrophe (MC) in RPE cells. We further observed an increased level of autophagy in the RPE cells undergoing MC (RPE-MC cells). Importantly, autophagy inhibition induced nonapoptotic cell death in RPE-MC cells. These findings indicate that autophagy has a pivotal role in the survival of RPE-MC cells. We next observed PINK1 accumulation in the mitochondrial membrane and parkin translocation into the mitochondria from the cytosol in the rotenone-treated RPE-MC cells, which indicates that increased mitophagy accompanies MC in ARPE-19 cells. Noticeably, the mitophagy also contributed to the cytoprotection of RPE-MC cells. Although there might be a significant gap in the roles of autophagy and mitophagy in the RPE cells
