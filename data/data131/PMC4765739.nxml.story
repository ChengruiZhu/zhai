The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is the largest intracellular organelle of mammalian cells. It is responsible for many fundamental cellular functions, such as folding, quality control of membrane and secreted protein, lipid biosynthesis, control of apoptosis and calcium storage. Recent studies have shown that many ER membrane proteins are lipid modified. We therefore hypothesized that palmitoyltransferases, the enzymes responsible for this modifications, act as a regulator of the mammalian ER, controlling the function of a network of key proteins through reversible acylation. In this work we combine computational methods with experimental determination of parameters to study the mechanisms and properties of ER palmitoylation, using as a model the palmitoylation of the ER protein calnexin. The systematic analysis of the mathematical model, built and calibrated with the help of experimental data, shows that Calnexin palmitoylation leads to a 9-fold increase in half-life and that a long delay separates synthesis from palmitoylation in unstimulated cells. Surprisingly during this delay, 75% of synthesized calnexin is degraded before being palmitoylated. We hypothesize that this unexpected apparent inefficiency is a design principle that provides the cell with a means to post-translationally tune the calnexin content.
