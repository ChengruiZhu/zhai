The need for well-validated targets for drug discovery is more pressing than ever, especially in cancer in view of resistance to current therapeutics coupled with late stage drug failures. Target prioritization and selection methodologies have typically not taken the protein interaction environment into account. Here we analyze a large representation of the human interactome comprising almost 90,000 interactions between 13,345 proteins. We assess these interactions using an extensive set of topological, graphical and community parameters, and we identify behaviors that distinguish the protein interaction environments of drug targets from the general interactome. Moreover, we identify clear distinctions between the network environment of cancer-drug targets and targets from other therapeutics areas. We use these distinguishing properties to build a predictive methodology to prioritize potential drug targets based on network parameters alone and we validate our predictive models using current FDA-approved drug targets. Our models provide an objective, interactome-based target prioritization methodology to complement existing structure-based and ligand-based prioritization methods. We provide our interactome-based predictions alongside other druggability predictors within the public canSAR resource (
