The acid-sensing ion channels (ASICs) are key receptors for extracellular protons and are becoming increasingly important drug targets. However, their gating mechanism is still not fully understood. The crystallographic structure of the ASIC1 protein provides a clue, but the dynamics of the channel remains to be elucidated. Using computational biology, site-directed mutagenesis, and electrophysiological recordings, we investigated the dynamics of ASIC1 gating. Through “normal mode analysis,” we detected a series of collective motions between the beta turn and transmembrane domain, and between the thumb and finger domains, suggesting a deformation pathway related to channel gating. The intrinsic rotation of the extracellular domain and the collective motions between the thumb and finger domains that are induced by proton binding serve to deform the channel from the extracellular to the transmembrane domain, triggering a “twist-to-open” motion of the channel pore. The relationship between the dynamics and the gating mechanism was experimentally confirmed by a series of complementary mutations in ASIC1 and electrophysiological measurements. Our study also indicated that the likely position of the channel gate is around Leu440 within the ASIC1 protein. We propose a clear model correlating the structural dynamics of ASIC1 and its gating mechanism.
