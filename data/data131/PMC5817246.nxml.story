The science of regenerative medicine is arguably older than transplantation—the first major textbook was published in 1901—and a major regenerative medicine meeting took place in 1988, three years before the first Banff transplant pathology meeting. However, the subject of regenerative medicine/tissue engineering pathology has never received focused attention. Defining and classifying tissue engineering pathology is long overdue. In the next decades, the field of transplantation will enlarge at least tenfold, through a hybrid of tissue engineering combined with existing approaches to lessening the organ shortage. Gradually, transplantation pathologists will become tissue‐(re‐) engineering pathologists with enhanced skill sets to address concerns involving the use of bioengineered organs. We outline ways of categorizing abnormalities in tissue‐engineered organs through traditional light microscopy or other modalities including biomarkers. We propose creating a new Banff classification of tissue engineering pathology to standardize and assess de novo bioengineered solid organs transplantable success in vivo. We recommend constructing a framework for a classification of tissue engineering pathology now with interdisciplinary consensus discussions to further develop and finalize the classification at future Banff Transplant Pathology meetings, in collaboration with the human cell atlas project. A possible nosology of pathologic abnormalities in tissue‐engineered organs is suggested.
