Human decision-making often appears irrational. A major challenge is to explain why apparently irrational behavior occurs and what potential benefits it might have conferred for our evolutionary ancestors. A well-studied behavior in experimental psychology is “confirmation bias,” where we sample information that simply confirms what we already believe. In this study, we show that one factor giving rise to such information sampling biases is Pavlovian approach: our natural tendency to approach items that are associated with reward. We demonstrate three novel information sampling biases in a large-scale smartphone experiment with >30,000 human subjects. We examine how these three biases are related to Pavlovian approach, as quantified via an entirely independent economic choice task. We also show that, within our population, information sampling is a stable trait of an individual that is related to demographic variables such as age and education. Although irrational in the context of our task, we postulate that approach-induced biases in information sampling may have been adaptive over evolutionary history. They would drive organisms towards gathering information about locations that they will eventually engage with to obtain reward.
