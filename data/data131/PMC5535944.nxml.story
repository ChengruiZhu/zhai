Immunosenescence defines the decline in immune function that occurs with aging. This has been associated, at least in part, with defective cellular signaling via protein kinase C (PKC) signal transduction pathways. Our data suggest reduced PKC activation and consequently reduced response to lipopolysaccharide (LPS) stimulation and cytokine release. The lack of PKC activation seems to be dependent on the reduced expression of the receptor for activated C kinase 1 (RACK1), a scaffolding protein involved in multiple signal transduction cascades. The defective expression of RACK1 may be dependent on age-related alteration of the balance between the adrenal hormones cortisol and dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA). DHEA levels reduce with aging, while cortisol levels remain substantially unchanged, resulting in an overall increase in the cortisol:DHEA ratio. These hormonal changes are significant in the context of RACK1 expression and signaling function because DHEA administration in vivo and in vitro can restore the levels of RACK1 and the function of the PKC signaling cascade in aged animals and in human cells. In contrast, there is evidence that cortisol can act as a negative transcriptional regulator of RACK1 expression. The
