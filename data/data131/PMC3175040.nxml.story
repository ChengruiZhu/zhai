Over the last decade metabolomics has gained increasing popularity and significance in life sciences. Together with genomics, transcriptomics and proteomics, metabolomics provides additional information on specific reactions occurring in humans, allowing us to understand some of the metabolic pathways in pathological processes. Abnormal levels of such metabolites as nucleosides in the urine of cancer patients (abnormal in relation to the levels observed in healthy volunteers) seem to be an original potential diagnostic marker of carcinogenesis. However, the expectations regarding the diagnostic value of nucleosides may only be justified once an appropriate analytical procedure has been applied for their determination. The achievement of good specificity, sensitivity and reproducibility of the analysis depends on the right choice of the phases (e.g. sample pretreatment procedure), the analytical technique and the bioinformatic approach. Improving the techniques and methods applied implies greater interest in exploration of reliable diagnostic markers. This review covers the last 11Â years of determination of urinary nucleosides conducted with the use of high-performance liquid chromatography in conjunction with various types of detection, sample pretreatment methods as well as bioinformatic data processing procedures.
