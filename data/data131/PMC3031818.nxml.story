This keynote presentation focuses on the experiences and evidence of two examples of community based mental health services in Finland: first, supported employment services for vulnerable groups; and second, the ‘clubhouse model’ that provides comprehensive community-based services for persons with mental health problems. Both service models are based on similar principles, but aiming at a bit different goals. Supported employment, for example, has a clear goal of achieving for clients a paid job in the open labour market through professional support in the work place. The goal of the clubhouse model is more diffuse since it seeks to empower individuals and improve psychosocial well-being through peer support and the development of a ‘community’. Both are based on social support, social inclusion and care integration with other services. The paper shows how supported employment has a strong evidence-base, both from research and practice, but that there have been problems in mainstreaming such services. The paper also describes how the clubhouse model has seen rapid growth in the US and Europe, and especially in Finland and that evidence support the benefits of the approach. However, there remains a need for carefully conducted and rigorous research on its long-term impact.
