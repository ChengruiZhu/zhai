Management option of hepatic echinococcosis represents a major challenge for a surgeon. The aim of the study was to evaluate surgical treatment of patients with hepatic echinococcosis at the surgery department of the regional hospital in Prizren (Kosovo). The medical records of 22 patients operated for hepatic echinococcosis in our department during a four year study period (2009–2013) were retrospectively reviewed. Apart from the total of 5850 operated patients, 22 cases were diagnosed for liver echinococcosis (0.4%). The most affected age group was from 26 to 50 years (54.5%). Female gender, 16 cases (73%), and patients living in rural places, 14 patients (64%), dominated significantly. The most affected region was Municipality of Dragash. All patients underwent ultrasonography, 13 patients underwent CT scans and 5 patients MRI of abdomen. The mean preoperative ultrasonographic diameter of cysts was 9.5 cm and maximal 21 cm. Cysts were most often localized in right hepatic lobe (77%) and subcostal laparotomy was most commonly performed (82%). The performed surgical procedures were: endocystectomy and partial pericystectomy with omentoplication according to Papadimitris (73%), endocystectomy and capitonnage and endocystectomy with external drainage (14%). The laparoscopic approach was used only in one patient. In conclusion, hepatic echinococosis was not common among operated patients at our surgery department. Subcostal laparotomy with endocystectomy and partial pericystectomy with omentoplication according to Papadimitris was most commonly used. Exact distribution of echinococcosis is needed to be analyzed with a larger cohort study including all surgery units in the country and with a longer monitoring.
