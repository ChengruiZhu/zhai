We have developed a treatment planning protocol for intensity‐modulated radiation therapy of the prostate using commercially available inverse planning software. Treatment plans were developed for ten patients using the Corvus version 3.8 planning system, testing various prescription options, including tissue types, dose volume histogram values for the target and normal structures, beam arrangements, and number of intensity levels. All plans were scaled so that 95% of the clinical target volume received 75.6 Gy; mean doses to the prostate were typically 79 Gy. The reproducibility of the inverse planning algorithm was tested by repeating a set of the plans five times. Plans were deemed acceptable if they satisfied predefined dose constraints for the targets and critical organs. Figures of merit for target coverage, target dose uniformity, and organ sparing were used to rank acceptable plans. Certain systematic behaviors of the optimizer were noted: the high dose regions for both targets and critical organs were 5–10 Gy more than prescribed; reducing bladder and rectum tolerance increased the range of doses within the target; increasing the number of fields incrementally improved plan quality. A set of planning parameters was found that usually satisfied the minimum requirements. Repeating the optimization with different beam order produced similar but slightly different dose distributions, which was sometimes useful for finding acceptable solutions for difficult cases. The standard set of parameters serves as a useful starting point for individualized planning.
