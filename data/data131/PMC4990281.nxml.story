Inside individual cells, gene products often occur at low molecular counts and are subject to considerable stochastic fluctuations (noise) in copy numbers over time. An important consequence of noisy expression is that the level of a protein can vary considerably even among genetically identical cells exposed to the same environment. Such non-genetic phenotypic heterogeneity is physiologically relevant and critically influences diverse cellular processes. In addition to noise sources inherent in gene product synthesis, recent experimental studies have uncovered additional noise mechanisms that critically effect expression. For example, the time within the cell cycle when a gene duplicates, and the time taken to complete cell cycle are governed by random processes. The key contribution of this work is development of novel mathematical results quantifying how cell cycle-related noise sources combine with stochastic expression to drive intercellular variability in protein molecular counts. Derived formulas lead to many counterintuitive results, such as increasing randomness in the timing of cell division can lower noise in the level of a protein. Finally, these results inform experimental strategies to systematically dissect the contributions of different noise sources in the expression of a gene of interest.
