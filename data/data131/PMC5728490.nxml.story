Cells must have sufficient nutrients in order to perform their different functions. This becomes particularly critical when the nutrient composition in their environment changes. To accommodate such changes, cells have evolved specialized adaptation pathways that sense the nutrients available in their surrounding and adapt their gene expression and protein functions accordingly. It is typically assumed that these different starvation pathways have been optimized to enable growth in conditions in which nutrients are limiting. We reasoned, however, that since starvation periods are necessarily followed by nutrient retrieval, the starvation response may further function to optimize the recovery from starvation once nutrients are replenished. In the present study, we show that this is indeed the case for the well-studied phosphate starvation pathway in budding yeast. Using a combination of transcription profiling and high-resolution competition assays, we have characterized, at high temporal resolution, the growth-fitness advantage cells gain from activation of the phosphate starvation program when they enter into starvation and also when they exit starvation when nutrient is replenished. We find that the cells activate the starvation program in 2 temporal waves. The first wave is activated at intermediate depletion that is not yet limiting for growth, while the second wave is activated when phosphate becomes limiting. Of note, we provide evidence that the early response promoted recovery from starvation by increasing phosphate influx. Our results corroborate the notion that cells have evolved not only to optimize their instantaneous growth but also to prepare for future, predicted challenges.
