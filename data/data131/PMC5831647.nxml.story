The cohesin protein complex has multiple functions in eukaryotic cells. It ensures that when a cell divides, the two daughter cells receive the correct number of chromosomes. It does this by holding together the sister chromatids that are formed when chromosomes are duplicated by DNA replication. Cohesin also helps repair damaged DNA, and to regulate genes important for growth and development. Even minor deficiencies in some proteins that regulate cohesin cause significant human birth defects. Here we investigated in Drosophila cells how three proteins, Pds5, Wapl and Brca2, determine where cohesin binds to chromosomes, control cohesinâ€™s ability to hold sister chromatids together, and participate in gene expression. We find that Pds5 and Wapl work together, likely during DNA replication, to determine which genes bind cohesin by controlling how far cohesin spreads out along chromosomes. Pds5 is required for cohesin to hold sister chromatids together, and Brca2 counteracts this function. In contrast to the opposing roles in sister chromatid cohesion, Pds5 and Brca2 work together to facilitate control of gene expression by cohesin. Brca2 plays a critical role in DNA repair, and these studies expand the known roles for Brca2 by showing that it also regulates sister chromatid cohesion and gene expression.
