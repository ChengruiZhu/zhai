Retinal oscillatory potentials (OPs) consist of a series of relatively high-frequency rhythmic wavelets, superimposed onto the ascending phase of the b-wave of the electroretinogram (ERG). However, the origin of OPs is uncertain and methods of measurement of OPs are diverse. In this study, we first isolated OPs from the rat ERG and fitted them with Gabor functions and found that the envelope of the OP contained information about maximum amplitude and time-to-peak to enable satisfactory quantification of the later OPs. And the OP/b-wave ratio should be evaluated to exclude an effect of the b-wave on the OPs. Next, we recorded OPs after intravitreal injection of 2-amino-4-phosphonobutyric acid (APB), tetrodotoxin (TTX), Î³-aminobutyric acid (GABA), strychnine (STR), SR95531 (SR), isoguvacine (ISO), (1,2,5,6-tetrahydropyridin-4-yl) methylphosphinic acid (TPMPA) and GABA+TPMPA. We showed that GABA and APB only removed the later OPs, when compared to control eyes. TTX delayed the peak time, and STR, SR and ISO reduced the amplitude of OPs. TPMPA delayed the peak time but increased the ratio of OPs to b-wave. Furthermore, administration of combined GABA and TPMPA caused the later OPs to increase in amplitude with time, compared with those after delivery of GABA alone. Finally, we observed that GABAc and glycine receptors contributed to a low-frequency component of the OPs, while GABAa contributed to both components. These results suggest that the early components of the OPs are mainly generated by the photoreceptors, whilst the later components are mainly regulated by GABAa, GABAc and glycine receptors.
