In humans it has been known for some time that exposure to environmental insults during pregnancy can harm a developing fetus and have life-long effects on the individual's health. A well known example is fetal alcohol syndrome, where the children of mothers that consume large amounts of alcohol during pregnancy exhibit growth retardation, changes to the shape and size of the skull, and central nervous system defects. At present the molecular events underlying fetal alcohol syndrome are unknown. We have developed a model of alcohol exposure in the mouse, in which the genetics and the environment can be strictly controlled. We find that chronic exposure of the fetus to a physiologically relevant amount of alcohol during the first half of pregnancy results in epigenetic changes at a sensitive reporter gene and produces fetal alcohol syndrome-like features in some mice. Our model is a useful tool to study the underlying causes of fetal alcohol syndrome, and our work raises the interesting possibility that the long-term physical effects of alcohol exposure during pregnancy are mediated by epigenetic changes established in the fetus and then faithfully remembered for a lifetime. In the future, such epigenetic changes could be used as markers for the preclinical diagnosis and treatment of fetal alcohol spectrum disorders.
