This study was conducted to verify the effect of the ankle injury of athletes who attended the modern pentathlon for a long-term basis on ankle muscle’s strength and proprioceptive sensory function. For this, 10 athletes of the modern pentathlon, with experience of having damaged one side of their ankles within 6 months, and 10 healthy male college students, who have similar personal characteristics, such as height, age, and weight and have no experience of participating in regular sports for 3 or more times a week. The experimental subject was divided into 3 groups in all. After the flexor power of the plantar and dorsal side and the muscle strength of the varus and valgus for an ankle were measured by the Biodex System III at an angular velocity of 60°/sec and 120°/sec, it was documented as the maximum couple of force per body weight. Also, specified receptive senses were measured by the Biodex System III using the stop button to find the position (angle) of the joint. As a result of the conclusive research, participation in modern pentathlons for a long-term basis has caused an increase in valgus muscle strength and flexor power of the plantar side of the ankle when compared to general college students. Sports-related injury of the ankle was also found to result into the weakening of the flexor power on the plantar side and valgus muscle strength and a decrease of the proprioceptive sensory function.
