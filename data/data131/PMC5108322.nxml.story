 has not yet been determined. By combining inducible knockout mouse models with the BH3-mimetic compound ABT-737, which inhibits BCL-2, BCL-XL and BCL-W, we found that dependency on MCL-1, BCL-XL or BCL-2 expression changes during B-cell development. We show that BCL-XL expression promotes survival of immature B cells, expression of BCL-2 is important for survival of mature B cells and long-lived plasma cells (PC), and expression of MCL-1 is important for survival throughout B-cell development. These data were confirmed with novel highly specific BH3-mimetic compounds that target either BCL-2, BCL-XL or MCL-1. In addition, we observed that combined inhibition of these pro-survival proteins acts in concert to delete specific B-cell subsets. Reduced expression of MCL-1 further sensitized immature as well as transitional B cells and splenic PC to loss of BCL-XL expression. More markedly, loss of MCL-1 greatly sensitizes PC populations to BCL-2 inhibition using ABT-737, even though the total wild-type PC pool in the spleen is not significantly affected by this drug and the bone marrow (BM) PC population only slightly. Combined loss or inhibition of MCL-1 and BCL-2 reduced the numbers of established PC >100-fold within days. Our data suggest that combination treatment targeting these pro-survival proteins could be advantageous for treatment of antibody-mediated autoimmune diseases and B-cell malignancies.
