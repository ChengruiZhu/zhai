Protein therapeutics have created a revolution in disease therapy, providing improved outcomes for prevalent illnesses and conditions while at the same time yielding treatments for diseases that were previously intractable. However, this powerful class of drugs is subject to their own unique challenges and risk factors. In particular, the biological origins of therapeutic proteins predispose them towards eliciting a detrimental immune response from the patient's own body. Therefore, fully capitalizing on the medicinal reservoir of natural and engineered proteins will require efficient, effective, and broadly applicable deimmunization technologies. We have developed deimmunization algorithms that simultaneously optimize therapeutic candidates for both low immunogenicity and high-level activity and stability. Here, we combine computational modeling and experimental analysis to show that the process of protein deimmunization manifests inherent tradeoffs between immunogenic potential and biomolecular function. Our experimental results demonstrate that dual objective optimization allows us to assess and design for these tradeoffs, thereby enabling facile construction of deimmunized variants that span a broad range of immunogenicity and functionality performance parameters. Thus, we can rapidly map the design space for deimmunized drug candidates, and we can use this information to guide selection of engineered proteins that are most likely to meet performance benchmarks for a given clinical application.
