The proto-oncoprotein Cbl is known to control several signaling processes. It is highly expressed in the testis, and because spermatogenesis is androgen dependent, we investigated the androgen dependency expression of Cbl through its testicular sublocalization and its expression levels in rats that were exposed to the antiandrogen flutamide or were hypophysectomized. We report the androgen dependency of Cbl as it localizes in pachytene spermatocytes during androgen-dependent stages, is down-regulated upon flutamide exposure, and is up-regulated with testosterone in hypophysectomized rats. Coculture experiments showed the key control exerted by the Sertoli cell on Cbl activity. As flutamide induces germ cell apoptosis, we investigate members of the Bcl-2 family upon flutamide exposure. We show that the proapoptotic Bcl-2 family member Bim mirrored Cbl expression through a posttranscriptional process. We also show that in Cbl knockout mouse testes, the imbalance between the high expression of Bim and Smac/Diablo and antiapoptotic factors such as cellular inhibitor of apoptosis 2 favors a survival process, which makes these mice unresponsive to androgen withdrawal and could explain their hypofertility.
