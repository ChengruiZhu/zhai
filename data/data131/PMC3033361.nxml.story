Protein structure comparison is important for understanding the evolutionary relationships among proteins, predicting protein functions, and predicting protein structures. Despite its importance, there have been no rigorous mathematical or statistical frameworks for protein structure comparison. One notable issue in this field is that with many different similarity measures used in comparing protein structures, none of them are proper distances when protein structures of different sequences are compared. In this study, we develop a mathematical framework for protein structure comparison by treating protein structures as three dimensional curves. A formal distance, geodesic distance, can be computed for any two protein structures. In this framework, population-specific variations within protein families can be characterized through building probability distributions for structures of protein families. The mean and covariance computed from groups of protein structures can also help to improve the classifications of protein structures. With curves representing protein structures, the matching is performed using elastic shape analysis of curves, which can effectively model conformational changes and insertions/deletions.
