Tuberculosis (TB) of the head and neck region is quite common in endemic countries, but is still misdiagnosed due to its varied presentation and different sites of involvement. The aims of the present study were to present the diversities of presentation of head and neck tuberculosis with the diagnostic predicaments faced during evaluation and to assess treatment response to anti-tubercular treatment (ATT). We analysed 48 patients with head and neck tuberculosis who presented to the Department of Otorhinolaryngology in our tertiary care urban hospital over a period of two years from 2013 to 2015 and recorded their data, which included presenting complaints, local and systemic examination findings, investigation results and treatment outcomes. The results showed that majority (64.5%) of cases were female and none of the patients were HIV positive. The most common manifestation was cervical lymphadenopathy (81.25%) with level II being the most commonly affected (31.3%). Three of the 48 patients had coexisting pulmonary TB. Fine needle aspiration cytology (FNAC), histopathological diagnosis and acid fast bacilli (AFB) staining were used to confirm diagnosis. All patients were treated with Category I ATT, which achieved cure in 96.8% of cases. Though cervical lymphadenitis is the most common presentation of head and neck TB, isolated involvement of the sinonasal region, larynx, oral cavity and other sub-sites are not solely unknown entities. It is, therefore, important for clinicians to be aware of atypical and misleading presentations and consider TB as a major differential diagnosis in the head and neck region, even in non-immunocompromised individuals.
