Many biological processes such as cell proliferation and signaling are guided by mechanical stress. Proteins as the molecular machinery behind these processes are reacting to or withstanding mechanical forces in specific ways. How mechanical stress propagates through proteins to induce a certain mechanical response is currently unknown. We here present a new method that detects force distribution in proteins, reminiscent of computational approaches used to engineer macroscopic structures. The method is based on molecular dynamics simulations during which we calculate changes in interatomic forces, here caused by pulling the protein. We apply this method to the extremely robust immunoglobulin domain of the muscle protein titin and obtain the mechanical network of stress-bearing elements spanning the protein scaffold. Mutations in this region were shown to result in a significant loss of mechanical stability. We then ask how the remarkable mechanical stability has been designed during evolution. To this end, we compare the force distribution network with a network of coevolved residues found in the immunoglobulin family. Both networks show a remarkable overlap, thereby suggesting that the observed stress propagation pattern reflects constraints used during evolution to render this protein mechanically robust.
