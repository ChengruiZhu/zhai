Telomeres are specialized nucleoprotein complexes that distinguish the natural ends of linear chromosomes from intrachromosomal double-strand breaks. In fact, telomeres are protected from DNA damage checkpoints, homologous recombination, or end-to-end fusions that normally promote repair of intrachromosomal DNA breaks. When chromosome end protection fails, dysfunctional telomeres are targeted by the DNA repair and recombination apparatus, whose outcomes range from the generation of chromosomal abnormalities, general hallmarks for human cancer cells, to permanent cell cycle arrest and cell death. While several studies address the consequences of telomere dysfunctions, the mechanisms by which telomere protection is achieved remain to be determined. Here, we investigate this issue by analyzing the role of evolutionarily conserved telomeric proteins in protecting budding yeast telomeres from degradation. We demonstrate that the key telomeric proteins Yku, Rap1, Rif1, and Rif2 inhibit telomere degradation by specifically preventing the action of different nucleases. As these proteins are functionally conserved between budding yeast and mammalian cells, they might also play critical roles in preventing telomere degradation in humans.
