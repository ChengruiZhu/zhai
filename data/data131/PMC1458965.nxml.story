MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are short RNA molecules that recognize specific target sequences in the 3′ region of mRNAs. These miRNAs can then specifically keep the mRNAs from being expressed, or translated into proteins. In this article, the authors ask what happens when a targeted mRNA has several forms differing by their 3′ regions. Such 3′ variations are very common. If two or more variations are present in a single mRNA, the result is two or more mRNAs with 3′ ends of different lengths. If an miRNA target is located between the two sites of variability, the shorter transcript should be target free and should escape miRNA-mediated inhibition, while longer transcripts should be inhibited. To test this hypothesis, the authors looked at mRNAs that had these variable 3′ ends. Variants containing targets for certain miRNAs appeared to be specifically underrepresented in tissues where these particular miRNAs are found. This principle was used to find other sequence patterns in 3′ regions that had a similar effect, and a list of 312 significant patterns was obtained. The authors then scanned genome sequences and identified possible cognate miRNAs for these patterns. This new knowledge will help further an understanding of how genes are controlled.
