The brain is critically dependent on an adequate supply of energy as it consumes up to 20% of the oxygen we breathe. Here we determine the distance scale over which interruptions in blood flow affect synaptic hard wiring and brain function. High-resolution microscopy of live mice was used to image cerebral cortex synapses (the sites of connections between neurons) in real time during targeted interruptions of cortical blood flow that model small survivable strokes. Under normal conditions, synapses were tightly coupled to small brain blood vessels, on average only 13 μm away. During targeted strokes, we find that normal synaptic structure can be maintained by flowing blood vessels at a much greater distance of 80 μm. In contrast to structure, brain function was more sensitive to interruption in blood flow and was only present 400 μm from the border of synaptic structural damage. The identification of intact brain structure in regions lacking function defines brain tissue in which restoration of normal blood flow restores function. Our results define the range of influence that blood flow has on cortical fine structure and function and are important for understanding both the pathology of stroke and how changes in blood flow alter the normal brain.
