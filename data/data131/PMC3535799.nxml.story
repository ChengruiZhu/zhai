Transvaginal hydrolaparoscopy (THL) is being performed regularly in Europe and China, but rarely in the United States. The reasons may be physiciansâ€™ unfamiliarity with the procedure and their uneasiness over potential rectal puncturing due to the proximity of the rectum to the vaginal trocar insertion site. THL has the advantage over hysterosalpingography (HSG) in that it allows for direct visualization of the tubal mucosa in addition to determining tubal patency. THL has advantages over traditional laparoscopy in that it does not require an abdominal incision and has the capability of being conducted in an outpatient office setting with local anesthesia. Studies have shown that THL has comparable accuracy to laparoscopy with 96.1% concordance between THL and laparoscopic findings. THL may be combined with chromopertubation and salpingoscopy. In addition to diagnostic purposes, THL may be used for operative intervention including adhesiolysis, endometriosis ablation, and ovarian drilling. Studies from France and China report the occurrence of rectal injury from 0% to1%. Despite the advantages of THL and low reports of rectal injury, THL has not gained popularity in the United States. The purpose of this article is to familiarize gynecologists in the United States with THL.
