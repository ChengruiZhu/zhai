Nodular lymphocyte predominant Hodgkin lymphoma (NLPHL) is a subtype of Hodgkin lymphoma characterized by a unique clinical and histological presentation. Because of the rare nature of this disease, few large-scale studies are available. We conducted a cohort study in which patients were identified in the Netherlands Cancer Registry in the Southeast of the Netherlands between 1990 and 2010. Of these patients, we collected all clinical characteristics and re-reviewed pathologic material to confirm NLPHL diagnosis. Seventy-three histologically confirmed cases of NLPHL were analyzed with a median follow-up of 65 months (range 4–257 months). Median age at diagnosis was 43 years (range 1–87); 84.9 % of the patients were male; B symptoms were present in 5.5 %; and stage I/II disease was most common (75.4 %). Patients were primarily treated with radiotherapy (50.7 %), chemotherapy (26 %), combined modality (radiotherapy and chemotherapy) (11 %), or surgical excision with careful watch-and-wait (12.3 %). Relapses occurred in seven patients (9.6 %) after a median of 26 months (21–74 months). Six patients (8.2 %) developed histologic transformation to large cell lymphoma. Five patients (6.8 %) died during follow-up due to progression of NLPHL (
