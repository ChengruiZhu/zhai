Totally 188 patients had 213 non mass like lesions. Mean age of the patients was 44.9 Â± 8.3 years (24-63). Totally 46 of lesions were malignant (21.6%). The most common BIRADS score was 4 (116; 54.5%). The most prevalent feature of distribution, internal enhancement and curve type were focal (59.2%), clumped (27.2%) and washout (34.3%). Distribution of different subgroups of MR BIRADS features was different among benign and malignant lesions (All Pvalues < 0.05). Regarding association with malignancy, odds ratio of lesions with segmental or ductal linear distribution was 3.4 (95% CI = 1.7-6.8), Clumped, Reticular and Dendritic internal enhancement was 2.5 (95% CI = 1.3-5) and wash out curve type was 5.4 (95% CI = 2.7-10.9). Sensitivity of higher MR BIRADS (4,5) for diagnosis of malignancy was 100%. Specificity of segmental or ductal linear distribution in diagnosis of malignancy was 81%. Specificity of BIRADS 5 for diagnosis of malignancy was 98%. In a multivariate logistic regression analysis for diagnosis of malignancy in which distribution, internal enhancement and curve type were considered as independent variables, distribution and curve type remained significant in the model while the internal enhancement showed a borderline P-value.
