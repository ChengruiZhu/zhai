Susceptibility to breast cancer is partially encoded in our genomes, but despite the development of new genomic technologies over the past decade, we are still not able to accurately predict disease susceptibility from genome sequences. One reason for this gap is that we lack methods for finding combinations of genome variants that lead to disease. Extensive studies in model organisms have experimentally constructed millions of double mutants to study genetic interactions and have defined the basic principles by which genes combine to cause phenotypes in an organism. One powerful outcome of these studies in model systems is that genetic interactions frequently form highly organized patterns that can be used as a basis for improved detection of them in humans. We developed a novel computational approach based on this principle for identifying pathway-level interactions that contribute to breast cancer disease risk. Applying this method to six different groups of breast cancer patients, we identified a core set of pathways, including glutathione conjugation, vitamin D receptor, purine metabolism, mitotic prometaphase, and steroid hormone biosynthesis. These pathways are well-supported across multiple cohorts and may contribute to breast cancer susceptibility.
