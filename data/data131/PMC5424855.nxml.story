With hip fracture and dementia increasing in incidence in the global ageing population, there is a need for the development of specific procedures targeting optimal treatment outcomes for these patients. This paper looks primarily at the factors that limit access to subacute rehabilitation services as a growing body of evidence suggests that access to timely inpatient rehabilitation increases functional outcomes for patients both with dementia and without. Information was gathered by searching electronic data bases (SCOPUS, Medline, CINAHL, Health Source Nursing/Academic Addition, Psychinfo and the Cochrane Library) for relevant articles using the search terms dementia OR Alzheimer* AND hip fracture AND subacute rehabilitation OR convalescence for the period 2005â€“2015. Abstracts were scanned to identify articles discussing eligibility and access. A total of nine papers were identified that directly addressed this topic. Other papers discussing success or failure of rehabilitation and improved models of care were also reviewed. Barriers to access discussed in the literature include information management, management of comorbidities, attitudes, resource availability, and the quality of evidence and education. By identifying these factors we can identify strategic points of intervention across the trajectory of prevention, treatment and rehabilitation that may improve outcomes for this growing group of vulnerable patients. Emerging best practice for these patients is also discussed.
