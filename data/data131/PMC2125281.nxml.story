 1. 10 per cent. atoxyl in blood incubated at 37째 C. for 1 hour gives rise to a solution that is much more than ten times as toxic as a 1 per cent. solution of atoxyl similarly incubated. 2. When the comparison is made after incubation for 3 hours instead of for 1 hour, the toxicity of the 10 per cent. solution is but slightly greater than ten times that of the 1 per cent., provided the red blood corpuscles are not removed from the dilutions. 3. If the corpuscles are removed from both the 10 per cent. and the 1 per cent. atoxyl solutions immediately after incubation at 37째 for 1 to 3 hours, the dilutions of the 10 per cent. atoxyl are much more than ten times as toxic as the corresponding dilutions of the 1 per cent. atoxyl. 4. After incubation with atoxyl at 37째 for 1 to 3 hours, red blood corpuscles left at room temperature in dilutions made from the 10 per cent. and 1 per cent. solutions in blood increase markedly the toxicity of the dilutions made from the 1 per cent. atoxyl, but increase very slightly the toxicity of the dilutions made from the 10 per cent. atoxyl. 5. If one desires to produce a large amount of transformed atoxyl by incubating atoxyl in blood at 37째 for 1 to 3 hours, strong solutions of atoxyl should be chosen in preference to weaker solutions.
