The aim of this study was to investigate the changes of nutritional intake and nutritional status and analyze the association between them during hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. This was a retrospective cross sectional study on 36 patients (9 Autologous transplantation group and 27 Allogeneic transplantation group) undergoing hematopoietic stem cell transplantation at The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul St. Mary's Hospital from May to August 2010. To assess oral intake and parenteral nutrition intake, 24-hour recall method and patient's charts review was performed. Nutritional status was measured with the scored patient-generated subjective global assessment (PG-SGA). The subjects consisted of 6 (66.7%) males and 3 (33.3%) females in the autologous transplantation group (auto), 12 (44.4%) males and 15 (55.6%) females in the allogeneic transplantation group (allo). The mean age was 40.9 ± 13.6 years (auto) and 37.8 ± 11.0 years (allo). The average hospitalized period was 25.2 ± 3.5 days (auto) and 31.6 ± 6.6 days (allo), which were significant different (p < 0.05). Nutritional intake was lowest at Post+1wk in two groups. In addition, calorie intake by oral diet to recommended intake at Post+2wk was low (20.8% auto and 20.5% allo) but there were no significant differences in change of nutritional intake over time (Admission, Pre-1day, Post+1wk, Post+2wk) between auto group and allo group by repeated measures ANOVA test. The result of nutritional assessment through PG-SGA was significantly different at Pre-1day only (p < 0.01). There was a significant negative correlation between the nutritional status during Post+2wk and the oral calorie/protein intake to recommended amount measured during Post+1wk and Post+2wk (p < 0.01). These results could be used to establish evidence-based nutritional care guidelines for patients during hematopoietic stem cell transplantation.
