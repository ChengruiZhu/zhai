Hemidesmosomes are specialized protein complexes that promote anchorage of the basal keratinocyte cell layer of the epidermis to the underlying dermis. They provide tissue integrity and resistance to mechanical forces. When hemidesmosomes do not function properly, skin blistering ensues in response to mechanical trauma. Plectin is an essential component of hemidesmosomes. Humans carrying recessive mutations in the plectin gene most frequently develop multisystem disorders, where in addition to skin other tissues are also affected. However, there is a unique dominant plectin mutation, which leads to the disease epidermolysis bullosa simplex Ogna (EBS-Ogna), affecting skin exclusively. Because of that, EBS-Ogna is an exceptional system to study the contribution of plectin to hemidesmosome function. We have generated an EBS-Ogna mouse model that mimics the human disease. Using this model, we have learned that selective degradation of hemidesmosome-associated plectin isoform 1a by proteases activated specifically in keratinocytes results in reduced numbers and dysfunction of hemidesmosomes. In contrast, plectin-1c, another plectin isoform expressed in keratinocytes, is not degraded. Moreover, we find that plectin dimers can oligomerize via their long coiled-coil rod domain, a process likely to be instrumental in maintenance of hemidesmosome integrity. These findings highlight the importance of plectin-1a for hemidesmosome function.
