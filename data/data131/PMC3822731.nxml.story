Morphine is a potent analgesic, but the molecular mechanism for tolerance formation after repeated use is not fully understood. Binding immunoglobulin protein (BiP) is an endoplasmic reticulum (ER) chaperone that is central to ER function. We examined knock-in mice expressing a mutant BiP with the retrieval sequence deleted in order to elucidate physiological processes that are sensitive to BiP functions. We tested the thermal antinociceptive effect of morphine in heterozygous mutant BiP mice in a hot plate test. Paw withdrawal latencies before and after a single administration of morphine were not significantly different between the wild-type and mutant BiP mice. Repeated morphine administration caused the development of morphine tolerance in the wild-type mice. The activation of glycogen synthase kinase 3b (GSK-3b) was associated with morphine tolerance, because an inhibitor of GSK-3Î² prevented it. On the other hand, the mutant BiP mice showed less morphine tolerance, and the activation of GSK-3b was suppressed in their brain. These results suggest that BiP may play an important role in the development of morphine tolerance. Furthermore, we found that a chemical chaperone which improves ER protein folding capacity also attenuated the development of morphine tolerance in wild-type mice, suggesting a possible clinical application of chemical chaperones in preventing morphine tolerance.
