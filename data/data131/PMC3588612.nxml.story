The aim of this study was to examine the relationship between short sprint time (5 m) and strength metrics of the countermovement jump (CMJ) using a linear transducer in a group of trained athletes. Twenty-five male, trained subjects volunteered to participate in the study. Each volunteer performed 3 maximal CMJ trials on a Smith machine. Peak instantaneous power was calculated by the product of velocity taken with the linear transducer. For sprint testing, each subject performed three maximum 5 m sprints. Only the best attempt was considered in both tests. Pearson product–moment correlation coefficients between 5 m sprint performance and strength metrics of the CMJ were generally positive and of clear moderate to strong magnitude (r = −0.664 to −0.801). More noticeable was the significant predictive value of bar displacement time (r= ∼0.70) to sprint performance. Nevertheless, a non-significant predictive value of peak bar velocity and rate of force development measurements was found. These results underline the important relationship between 5 m sprint and maximal lower body strength, as assessed by the force, power and bar velocity displacement. It is suggested that sprinting time performance would benefit from training regimens aimed to improve these performance qualities.
