Proteins are essential molecules for performing a majority of functions in all biological systems. These functions often depend on the three-dimensional structures of proteins. Here, we investigate a fundamental question in molecular evolution: how can proteins acquire new advantageous structures via mutations while not sacrificing their existing structures that are still needed? Some authors have suggested that the same protein may adopt two or more alternative structures, switch between them and thus perform different functions with each of the alternative structures. Intuitively, such a protein could provide an evolutionary compromise between conflicting demands for existing and new protein structures. Yet no theoretical study has systematically tackled the biophysical basis of such compromises during evolutionary processes. Here we devise a model of evolution that specifically recognizes protein molecules that can exist in several different stable structures. Our model demonstrates that proteins can indeed utilize multiple structures to satisfy conflicting evolutionary requirements. In light of these results, we identify data from known protein structures that are consistent with our predictions and suggest novel directions for future investigation.
