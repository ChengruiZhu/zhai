A four-round Delphi consensus study was completed with 16 expert health professionals from either a clinical or clinical academic background, following completion of a structured literature review. Clinical experience ranged from 5 to 34 years (mean: 19.5 years). Consensus was sought on the optimal methods to achieve the clinical diagnosis of forefoot neuroma. Round 1 sought individual input with an open ended question. This developed a list of recommendations. Round 2 and 3 asked the participants to accept or reject each of the recommendations in the list in relation to the question: “What is the best way to clinically diagnose neuroma in the forefoot?” Votes that were equal to or greater than 60% were accepted into the next round; participant’s votes equal to or less then 20% were excluded. The remaining participant’s votes between 20 to 60% were accepted and placed into the following round for voting. Round 4 asked the participants to rank the list of recommendations according to the strength of recommendation they would give in relation to the question: “What is the best way to clinically diagnose neuroma in the forefoot?” The recruitment and Delphi rounds were conducted through email.
