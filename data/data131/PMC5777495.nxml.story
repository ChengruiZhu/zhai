 (papyrus) as a function of these isotropic and anisotropic processes. We tested the hypothesis that the FSGS would be influenced by predominant wind direction during pollen and seed dispersal, as well as by the physical distance between individuals. We genotyped a total of 510 adults and 407 juveniles from three papyrus swamps (Ethiopia) using 15 microsatellite markers. In addition, the contemporary directional dispersal by wind was evaluated by seed release-recapture experiments and complemented with parentage analysis. Adults and juveniles differed in the strength of isotropic FSGS ranging from 0.09 to 0.13 and 0.12 to 0.16, respectively, and this suggests variation in dispersal distance. Anisotropic FSGS was found to be a function of asymmetric wind direction during dispersal/pollination that varied between sites. Historical gene dispersal distance was astoundingly low (<4 m), possibly due to localized seed rain. According to our contemporary dispersal estimates, mean pollen dispersal distances were longer than those of seed dispersal (101 and <55 m, respectively). More than two-thirds of seeds and half of pollen grains were locally dispersed (â‰¤80 m). The difference in historical and contemporary dispersal distance probably resulted from the asymmetric wind direction due to change in vegetation cover in the surrounding matrix. We further concluded that, in addition to wind direction, post-dispersal processes could influence gene dispersal distance inferred from the FSGS.
