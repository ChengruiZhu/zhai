Small-angle scattering (SAS) has witnessed a breathtaking renaissance and expansion over the past 15 years regarding the determination of biomacromolecular structures in solution. While important issues such as sample quality, good experimental practice and guidelines for data analysis, interpretation, presentation, publication and deposition are increasingly being recognized, crucial topics such as the uniqueness, precision and accuracy of the structural models obtained by SAS are still only poorly understood and addressed. The present article provides an overview of recent developments in these fields with a focus on the influence of complementary NMR restraints and of a hydration shell on the uniqueness of biomacromolecular models. As a first topic, the impact of incorporating NMR orientational restraints in addition to SAS distance restraints is discussed using a quantitative visual representation that illustrates how the possible conformational space of a two-body system is reduced as a function of the available data. As a second topic, the impact of a hydration shell on modelling parameters of a two-body system is illustrated, in particular on its inter-body distance. Finally, practical recommendations are provided to take both effects into account and promising future perspectives of SAS approaches are discussed.
