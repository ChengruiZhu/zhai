Development of multicellular organisms such as humans requires appropriate activation of gene expression programs according to stages of differentiation. Many proteins that directly regulate this process have been identified, including histone-modifying enzymes and transcription factors. It is not clear whether nuclear pore proteins, proteins that form the only channels in the nuclear envelope that mediate nuclear transport, regulate developmental gene regulation in higher organisms such as humans. Here we show that one nuclear pore protein has a role in gene regulation during human cell differentiation, providing insight into the development-related and transport-independent function of nuclear pore proteins. We have found that the nuclear pore protein interacts with the human genome in a dynamic manner that is tightly linked to the developmental stage. In addition, manipulating the functional levels of the nuclear pore protein can disrupt expression of the developmental genes it associates with. Our results suggest that the nuclear pore protein functionally interacts with the genome during cell differentiation, uncovering an additional layer of developmental gene regulation in humans.
