Evolution, in viruses and other organisms, is the result of random genetic diversification by mutation or recombination and selection for survival. In most organisms, evolution is too slow to be observed directly and the evolutionary past has to be reconstructed from static snapshots of the population. This reconstruction requires simple models of evolution that typically neglect selection or recombination. In vigorously evolving organisms like HIV, such assumptions are questionable. However, HIV evolves rapidly enough that substantial evolution is observable during a chronic HIV infection within single patients. Using such time series data of evolution, we estimate the effective recombination rate of HIV (the rate of viral sex) to be similar to the mutation rate, rather than much larger as previously reported. We also study the strength of selection exerted on the virus by the immune system. We find that about 15% of the observed virus variants with mutations in the surface protein are favored and selected at a rate of 0.8% to 2% per virus replication cycle. Knowledge of the recombination rate and the strength of selection is essential for quantitative modeling and understanding of HIV evolution.
