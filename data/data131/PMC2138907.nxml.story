 structure, and is present in normal mouse serum at a concentration of 0.1–0.2 mg/ml. Its molecular weight, low carbohydrate content, glycopeptide analysis, and C-terminal analysis are all typical of the IgG class. The intact protein had a strong tendency to form noncovalent aggregates with itself which were dissociable in acid. Upon papain digestion an Fab fragment of 47,000 mole wt was generated along with an Fc fragment which was insoluble at neutral pH. As for its biology, the protein did not fix complement, was not cytophilic for γG2 receptor sites on macrophages, and did not show passive cutaneous anaphylaxis. It was very efficiently transported across the placenta so that its concentration in the newborn was twice that in the serum of the mother, compared to the concentration of IgG1 and IgG2 proteins which were only present at one-third the concentration of that found in the serum of the mother. The Fc fragment of this protein reacted with and was solubilized by the staphylococcal A protein which also precipitated the intact immunoglobulin. In addition, the myeloma protein which was the prototype for this γG subclass exhibited binding activity for levan which was localized to the Fab fragment.
