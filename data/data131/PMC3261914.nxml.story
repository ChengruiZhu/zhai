The gamma rhythm is a prominent, 30–80-Hz EEG signal that is associated with cognition. Several classes of computational models have been posited to explain the gamma rhythm mechanistically. We study a particular class in which the gamma rhythm arises from delayed negative feedback. Our study is unique in that we calibrate the model from direct measurements. We also test the model's most critical predictions directly in experiments that take advantage of cutting-edge computer technologies able to simulate ion channels in real time. Our major findings are that a large amount of “background” synaptic input to neurons is necessary to promote the gamma rhythm; that inhibitory neurons are specially tuned to keep the gamma rhythm stable; that noise has a strong effect on network frequency; and that incoming sensory input can be represented with sensitivity that depends on the strength of excitatory-excitatory synapses and the number of neurons receiving the input. Overall, our results support the hypothesis that the gamma rhythm reflects the presence of delayed feedback that controls overall cortical activity on a cycle-by-cycle basis. Furthermore, its frequency range mainly reflects the timescale of synaptic inhibition, the degree of background activity, and noise levels in the network.
