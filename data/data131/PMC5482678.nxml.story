Osteoporosis is a disease characterized by structural deterioration of bone tissue, leading to skeletal fragility with increased fracture risk. Calcium phosphates (CaPs) are widely used in bone tissue engineering strategies as they have similarities to bone apatite except for the absence of trace elements (TEs) in the CaPs. Bioactive glasses (BGs) have also been used successfully in clinic for craniomaxillofacial and dental applications during the last two decades due to their excellent potential for bonding with bone and inducing osteoblastic differentiation. In this study, we evaluated the osteogenic effects of the ionic dissolution products of the quaternary Si-Sr-Zn-Mg-codoped CaP (TEs-CaP) or 45S5 BioglassÂ® (45S5 BG), both as mixtures and separately, on rat bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (rOMSCs & rMSCs) from osteoporotic and normal animals, using an MTT test and Alizarin Red S staining. The materials enhanced cell proliferation and osteogenic differentiation, especially the combination of the BG and TEs-CaP. Analysis by quantitative PCR and ELISA indicated that the expression of osteogenic-specific genes and proteins were elevated. These investigations suggest that the TEs-CaP and 45S5 BG operate synergistically to create an extracellular environment that promotes proliferation and terminal osteogenic differentiation of both osteoporotic and normal rMSCs.
