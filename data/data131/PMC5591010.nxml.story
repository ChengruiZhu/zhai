Protein-protein interaction networks have been extensively used in systems biology to study the role of proteins in cell function and disease. However, current network biology studies typically assume that one gene encodes one protein isoform, ignoring the effect of alternative splicing. Alternative splicing allows a gene to produce multiple protein isoforms, by alternatively selecting distinct regions in the gene to be translated to protein products. Here, we present a computational method to predict and analyze the large-scale effect of alternative splicing on protein-protein interaction networks. Starting with a reference protein-protein interaction network determined by experiments, our method annotates protein-protein interactions with domain-domain interactions, and predicts that a protein isoform loses an interaction if it loses the domain mediating the interaction as a result of alternative splicing. Our predictions reveal the central role of alternative splicing in extensively remodeling the human protein-protein interaction network, and in increasing the functional complexity of the human cell. Our prediction method complements ongoing experimental efforts by predicting isoform-specific interactions for genes not tested yet by experiments and providing insights into the functional impact of alternative splicing.
