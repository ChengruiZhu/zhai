 The spread of excitation in embryonic chick hearts, ranging in age from 7 to 20 days, was studied with both intracellular and extracellular electrodes. Evidence that the delay in ventricular excitation could be attributed to the cells of the entire atrioventricular (AV) ring was obtained, in part, from sagittal sections of the heart. In the intact preparation, uniform propagation occurred throughout the atrial roof at an apparent conduction velocity of 0.4 to 0.5 meter/sec. Delay of impulse propagation was localized in a very narrow band of tissue which extended across the AV ring. The apparent conduction velocity of this tissue was between 0.003 and 0.005 meter/sec. Both normal and retrograde propagation revealed the spread of conduction across the AV ring to be decremental in nature. This finding was supported by high frequency stimulation experiments which gave rise to AV block localized in the cells of the AV ring. Cardiac rhythmicity and AV transmission were responsive to acetylcholine and norepinephrine in much the same manner as in the adult mammalian heart. The present findings are in support of the hypothesis that the embryonic AV ring is the functional counterpart of the adult AV node.
