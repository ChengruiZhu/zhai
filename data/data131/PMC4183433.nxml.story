The reason for the hypersensitivity of POLQ-defective mammalian cells to ionizing radiation has been elusive. Here we show that POLQ-defective mammalian cells are selectively susceptible to double-strand breaks in DNA. We present experiments in mammalian cells showing that a specific double-strand break repair pathway is POLQ-dependent. To analyze the repair function in more detail, we examined class switch joining between DNA segments in antibody genes. Insertions of DNA bases are sometimes found at the joins between such segments, but the origin of these insertions has been mysterious. We show that this class of insertion joins during immunoglobulin class-switching is entirely POLQ-dependent. In experiments with purified human POLQ protein, we found a novel biochemical mechanism explaining the formation of the insertions. POLQ has a unique biochemical ability to extend DNA with minimal base pairing. Finally, we examined the biological consequences for chromosome stability. Unexpectedly, the Burkitt lymphoma translocation (a major cancer-associated genome instability) is enhanced in the absence of POLQ. This alters the current view about the action of DNA end joining in mammalian cells, revealing that a POLQ-dependent DNA repair pathway combats potentially damaging chromosome translocations.
