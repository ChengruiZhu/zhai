A 42-year-old man has been under long-term follow-up since he was a child for congenital glaucoma and buphthalmos in both eyes. His left eye best corrected visual acuity (BCVA) was counting fingers, due to end-stage glaucoma. He was on maximal medical therapy with an intraocular pressure (IOP) maintained at mid to low twenties. His right eye, the only seeing eye, had a BCVA of 6/9. This eye had undergone multiple glaucoma laser and surgical procedures, including an initial first Molteno drainage device inserted superonasally that failed in April 2003 due to fibrotic membrane over the tube opening. As a result, he subsequently had a second Molteno drainage device inserted inferotemporally. To further maximize his vision he had an uncomplicated cataract extraction and intraocular lens implant in December 2004, after which he developed postoperative cystoid macular edema and corneal endothelial failure. He underwent a penetrating keratoplasty in the right eye thereafter in March 2007. After approximately a year, the second Molteno device developed drainage tube retraction, which was managed surgically to maintain optimum IOP in the right eye. His right eye vision to date is maintained at 6/12.
