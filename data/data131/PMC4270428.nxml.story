To understand why some flu strains are more virulent than others, researchers attempt to profile and model the molecular human response to these strains and identify similarities and differences between the resulting models. So far, the modeling and analysis part has been done independently for each strain and the results contrasted in a post-processing step. Here we present a new method, termed MT-SDREM, that simultaneously models the response to all strains allowing us to identify both, the core response elements that are shared among the strains, and factors that are uniquely activated or repressed by individual strains. We applied this method to study the human response to three flu strains: H1N1, H3N2 and H5N1. As we show, the method was able to correctly identify several common and known factors regulating immune response to such strains and also identified unique factors for each of the strains. The models reconstructed by the simultaneous analysis method improved upon those generated by methods that model each strain response separately. Our joint models can be used to identify strain specific treatments as well as treatments that are likely to be effective against all three strains.
