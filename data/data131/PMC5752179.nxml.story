Familial exudative vitreoretinopathy (FEVR) is a rare hereditary retinal disorder characterized by the premature arrest of vascularization in the peripheral retina. The aim of the present study was to characterize the clinical presentations of a Chinese family affected by bilateral severe FEVR, and to identify the underlying genetic variations. One family that presented with bilateral FEVR was recruited for this study. Comprehensive ophthalmic examinations, including best-corrected visual acuity, slit-lamp examination, fundus photography, fundus fluorescein angiography imaging and electroretinogram were performed. Genomic DNA was extracted from leukocytes of the peripheral blood collected from the affected and unaffected family members, as well as 200 unrelated control subjects from the same population. Next-generation sequencing of the candidate genes associated with ocular diseases was performed, and the identified mutations were validated by conventional polymerase chain reaction-based sequencing. The functional effects of the mutations were analyzed by polymorphism phenotyping (PolyPhen) and sorting intolerant from tolerant (SIFT). One heterozygous ATP binding cassette subfamily A member 4 (
