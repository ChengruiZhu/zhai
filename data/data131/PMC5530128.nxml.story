Basal cell carcinoma is the most common type of cancer in fair-skinned individuals, and its incidence is rapidly increasing. The aim of the present study was to investigate the gene and protein expression of the mitochondrial solute carrier family 25 member 43 (SLC25A43) in basal cell carcinoma. SLC25A43 has previously been identified to be genetically altered and associated with cell proliferation in human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-positive breast cancer. However, the knowledge about SLC25A43 is limited, and its role in other cancers is unknown. The SLC25A43 gene and protein expression was analysed in 14 basal cell carcinomas and healthy skin samples from the same individuals by quantitative polymerase chain reaction and immunohistochemistry, respectively. The results demonstrated a significantly lower (â‰¥50%) SLC25A43 gene expression in all carcinomas compared with that in healthy skin. In addition, SLC25A43 protein expression was absent in >90% of all visual fields in the basal cell carcinomas, and the H-score was significantly lower in tumours compared with the adjacent epidermis. These results demonstrate that SLC25A43 expression is altered at the gene and protein levels in basal cell carcinoma. The underlying mechanisms and the clinical relevance of these data must be elucidated in additional experimental and clinical studies.
