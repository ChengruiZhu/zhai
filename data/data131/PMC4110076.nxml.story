The correct operation of the brain requires a carefully orchestrated activity, which includes the establishment of synchronized behavior among multiple neuronal populations. Synchronization of collective neuronal oscillations, in particular, has been suggested to mediate communication between brain areas, with the global oscillations acting as “information carriers” on which signals encoding specific stimuli or brain states are superimposed. But neuronal signals travel at finite speeds across the brain, thus leading to a wide range of delays in the coupling between neuronal populations. How the brain reaches the required level of coordination in the presence of such delays is still unclear. Here we approach this question in the case of two delay-coupled neuronal populations exhibiting collective oscillations in the gamma range. Our results show that effective communication can be reached even in the presence of relatively large delays between the populations, which self-organize in either in-phase or anti-phase synchronized states. In those states the transmission delays, phase difference, and oscillation frequency match to allow for communication at a wide range of coupling delays between brain areas.
