Cold-inducible RNA-binding protein (CIRP) and RNA-binding motif protein 3 (RBM3) are two evolutionarily conserved RNA-binding proteins that are transcriptionally upregulated in response to low temperature. Featuring an RNA-recognition motif (RRM) and an arginine–glycine-rich (RGG) domain, these proteins display many similarities and specific disparities in the regulation of numerous molecular and cellular events. The resistance to serum withdrawal, endoplasmic reticulum stress, or other harsh conditions conferred by RBM3 has led to its reputation as a survival gene. Once CIRP protein is released from cells, it appears to bolster inflammation, contributing to poor prognosis in septic patients. A variety of human tumor specimens have been analyzed for CIRP and RBM3 expression. Surprisingly, RBM3 expression was primarily found to be positively associated with the survival of chemotherapy-treated patients, while CIRP expression was inversely linked to patient survival. In this comprehensive review, we summarize the evolutionary conservation of CIRP and RBM3 across species as well as their molecular interactions, cellular functions, and roles in diverse physiological and pathological processes, including circadian rhythm, inflammation, neural plasticity, stem cell properties, and cancer development.
