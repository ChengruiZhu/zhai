, has a number of biological functions, such as antioxidative, anti-inflammatory, and nephroprotective properties. However, the protective effects of PD on MGO-induced apoptosis in endothelial cells remain to be elucidated. In this study, human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) were used to explore the effects of PD on MGO-induced cell apoptosis and the possible mechanism involved. HUVECs were pretreated with PD for 2â€‰h, followed by stimulation with MGO. Then cell apoptosis, reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation, mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) impairment, mitochondrial morphology alterations, and Akt phosphorylation were assessed. The results demonstrated that PD significantly prevented MGO-induced HUVEC apoptosis. PD pretreatment also significantly inhibited MGO-induced ROS production, MMP impairment, mitochondrial morphology changes, and Akt dephosphorylation. These results and the experiments involving N-acetyl cysteine (antioxidant), Cyclosporin A (mitochondrial protector), and LY294002 (Akt inhibitor) suggest that PD prevents MGO-induced HUVEC apoptosis, at least in part, through inhibiting oxidative stress, maintaining mitochondrial function, and activating Akt pathway. All of these data indicate the potential application of PD for the treatment of diabetic vascular complication.
