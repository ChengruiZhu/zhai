The vitamin A metabolite retinoic acid is an important signaling molecule needed for development of the central nervous system. Previous studies have shown a role for retinoic acid in regulating genes involved in the generation of motor neurons both in the hindbrain and spinal cord, but the role of retinoic acid in the forebrain has remained elusive. Here, we investigated mice that lack the ability to metabolize vitamin A into retinoic acid in the forebrain. Although no defects were observed in the generation of forebrain cortical neurons, we did observe a serious deficiency in GABAergic neurons, which provide inhibitory input to cortical neurons. Specifically, our results reveal that retinoic acid is required for forebrain neurons to activate an enzyme that converts glutamate to the inhibitory neurotransmitter GABA. We also find that retinoic acid treatment of human embryonic stem cells could stimulate production of GABAergic neurons. Deficiencies in GABAergic neurons have been associated with several neurological disorders, including Huntington's disease, autism, schizophrenia, and epilepsy. Knowledge of how GABAergic neurons are generated may aid efforts to treat these diseases.
