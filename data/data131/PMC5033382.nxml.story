Tissue Engineering involves the combination of cells, growth factors and biomaterials into artificial constructs which, upon implantation, can improve the healing capacity of the human body. A remaining challenge involves providing physical stimuli to individual cells, thereby guiding them towards the properties of the desired tissue type. Perfusion bioreactors try to control the local concentration of oxygen, nutrients and growth factors and mechanical stresses by varying the fluid flow. In this work, we predict the shear stress that individual cells experience at the microscopic scale, as a function of the bioreactor inlet flow velocity, by making use of the immersed boundary method. This method combines an Eulerian grid (fixed in space) with a Lagrangian grid (moving with the flow) to model the deformation of cells due to flow inside a scaffold pore. Our simulations show that the local shear stress levels on specific, realistic cell geometries are different from the shear stress levels on empty scaffolds, which are often still used as a reference. Finally, we predict and discuss the additional effect of realistic flow on other mechanical cell properties, such as its deformation and its cortical tension.
