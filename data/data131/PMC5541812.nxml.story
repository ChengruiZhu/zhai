Passive and active chronic cigarette smoking (CS) remains an international epidemic and a key risk factor for cardiovascular disease (CVD) development. CS-induced cardiac damage is divided into two major and interchangeable mechanisms: (1) direct adverse effects on the myocardium causing smoking cardiomyopathy and (2) indirect effects on the myocardium by fueling comorbidities such as atherosclerotic syndromes and hypertension that eventually damage and remodel the heart. To date, our understanding of cardiac remodeling following acute and chronic smoking exposure is not well elucidated. This manuscript presents for the first time the RIMD (oxidative stress (R), inflammation (I), metabolic impairment (M), and cell death (D)) detrimental cycle concept as a major player in CS-induced CVD risks and direct cardiac injury. Breakthroughs and latest findings in the field with respect to structural, functional, cellular, and molecular cardiac remodeling following chronic smoking exposure are summarized. This review also touches the genetics/epigenetics of smoking as well as the smoker's paradox and highlights the most currently prominent pharmacological venues to mitigate CS-induced adverse cardiac remodeling.
