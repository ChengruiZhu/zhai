Awareness of anatomical variations in lungs is essential during segmental or lobar resections of lungs. We studied the variations of fissures, lobes and hilar structures in 65 right and 73 left isolated lungs from the dissection hall. Horizontal fissure was absent in 3.07% and incomplete in 35.38% of right lungs. Four point six one percentage of right lungs had 3 fissures and 4 lobes. Three point zero seven percentage of right lungs had 3 arteries, 67.69% had 2 arteries, and 29.23% had only one artery in the hilum. Sixty-three point zero seven percentage of right lungs had two veins in the hilum; 32.30% had 3 veins in the hilum; and 4.61% had more than 3 veins in the hilum. Ninety-eight point four six percentage of right lungs showed 2 bronchi in the hilum, and 1.53% of them showed 3 bronchi in the hilum. Two of the right lungs (3.07%) had an artery passing across the oblique fissure. Fifteen point zero six percentage of left lungs showed incomplete oblique fissure and 2.73% showed 2 fissures and 3 lobes. Five point four seven percentage of left lungs showed 2 arteries and 94.52% had only one artery in the hilum. Eighty point eight two percentage of left lungs had two veins in the hilum and 19.17% had 3 veins in the hilum. Twenty-one point nine one percent of left lungs had 2 bronchi and 78.08% had only one bronchus in the hilum. The knowledge of variations in the lobar and hilar anatomy of the lung presented in this study is clinically important while interpreting the radiological images and performing surgical procedures.
