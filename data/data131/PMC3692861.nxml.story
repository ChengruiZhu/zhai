OBOH is the first binational regional network of its kind along the US-Mexico border recognizing the interconnectivity between human, animal, and environmental health. Given the limited resources in the current economic climate, the use of regional integrated surveillance systems provide an opportunity to protect and improve border health and security by moving away from species-specific surveillance programs. The process showcased here for the transparent review and prioritization of pathogens along the California-Baja California border can be used as a model along the entire US-Mexico Border. The ultimate aim is to protect border communities through the creation of a binational, early warning surveillance system which would allow for actionable and timely interventions to limit emergence, mitigate spread, provide gap analysis, and enhance prevention and control for several emergent and re-emergent diseases. Ultimately, this will decrease negative health and environmental impacts while improving agricultural and economic outcomes in both nations. However, obstacles such as continued sustainability, identification of new multi-disciplinary collaborators, cooperation between government agencies, and identifying funding for advancement of integrated regional surveillance systems remain challenges.
