Peritonitis is the most common infection in peritoneal dialysis (PD) and has been noted to be not only a cause of mortality but also the leading cause of technique failure in patients maintained on PD. Appropriate management of peritonitis to improve patient outcome has been the focus of clinical practice. We report a case of refractory PD-related peritonitis with surgical intervention intending to control ongoing peritoneal infection despite aggressive antibiotics and timely catheter removal. Exploratory laparotomy was performed in this case, and an encapsulated abscess in the peritoneal and pelvic cavity was obliterated. Adhesiolysis was done simultaneously. Continuous postoperative peritoneal lavage and drainage were implemented. Symptoms dramatically improved after operation, and indwelling tubes were removed several days later. Finally, the patient recovered and switched to permanent hemodialysis without intra-abdominal complications. Our case suggested that appropriate and timely surgical intervention in refractory peritonitis is necessary for saving lives in certain subgroups of patients. Clearly, well-designed studies with large samples are warranted to explore this issue in more detail.
