Groups of closely related species can rapidly evolve to occupy diverse ecological roles, but the ecological and genetic conditions that trigger this diversification are still highly debated. We examined patterns of molecular evolution across the genomes of a recent radiation of pupfishes that includes two trophic specialists. Despite apparently widespread ecological opportunities and gene flow across the Caribbean, this radiation is endemic to a single Bahamian island. Using the whole genomes of 42 pupfish we found evidence of extensive and previously unexpected variation in evolutionary relatedness among Caribbean pupfish. While adaptive introgression appears to be rare across the genomes of the San Salvador Island species, it may have introduced adaptive variants important in the evolution of the complex phenotypes of the specialists. Four of the 11 candidate adaptive introgression regions contain genes with known effects on jaw morphology in zebrafish or associated with pupfish jaw size, the primary axis of phenotypic divergence between species in this system. Our findings that multiple sources of genetic variation contribute to the San Salvador Island radiation suggests that a complex suite of factors, including hybridization with other species, may be necessary for adaptive radiation in addition to ecological opportunity.
