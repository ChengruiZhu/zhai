Assessed by flow cytometry, we demonstrated a significant linear correlation between average fluorescence intensity of green fluorescent protein (GFP) and a wide range of multiplicity of infection (MOI), spanning from 0.01 to 200. Average GFP intensity was calculated by mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) × percentage of infection (POI) (MFI × POI) and the correlation was observed in cells transduced with GFP-expressing adenoviral vector driven either by a cytomegalovirus (CMV) promoter for 3 to 6 h or by a human phosphoglycerate kinase (PGK) promoter for 18 to 24 h. Factors impacting this linear correlation include MOI of viral vector, strength of promoter driving GFP expression, cell type transduced and incubation time after gene transfer. We also found that weak GFP signals could be interfered by background signals, whereas strong GFP signals could overshot the detection limitation of the flow cytometer and resulted in a deviation from linearity which was prevented by adjusting the setting in flow cytometer. Moreover, we compared promoter strength as measured by MFI × POI and found that the relative activity of CMV promoter to PGK promoter was 20 to 47 folds in A549 cells and 32 to > 100 folds in H1299 cells.
