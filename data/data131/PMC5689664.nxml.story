Systemic diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) is a potentially curable disease using current regimen of immunochemotherapy. Central nervous system (CNS) relapse is a complication that occurs in approximately 5% of DLBCL patients and is associated with a high fatality rate. Early identification of molecular markers for CNS involvement may serve for the highly needed accurate stratification of patients into risk groups regarding CNS relapse. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small non-coding RNA molecules that regulate gene expression at the post-transcriptional level and are known to be involved in DLBCL pathophysiology. In this study, we utilized miRNA multiplex reading of systemic newly diagnosed DLBCL samples obtained from patients with clinical risk factors for CNS involvement whose disease course was distinguished by the presence or absence of subsequent CNS relapse. The analysis detected two differentially expressed miRNAs, miR-20a and miR-30d, that predict for CNS involvement. Replication of these results in different samples was used for validation. We performed bioinformatics miRNA-target enrichment analysis to reveal a number of putative mechanisms for these miRNAs regulation of CNS relapse, including neuronal plasticity and WNT signaling pathway. Altogether, we show that the expression level of two miRNAs may have valuable information that may refine stratification for patients-at-risk for relapse with CNS involvement in DLBCL. Further larger scale studies are needed to shed light on the pathways involved in this disease.
