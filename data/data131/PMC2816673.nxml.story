Many human diseases are related to each other through shared causes or even shared pathology. Knowledge of these relationships has long been exploited to treat similar diseases with the same therapies. However, most of the traditional approaches to discover these relationships have depended on subjective measures, such as similarity in symptoms, or incomplete knowledge, such as genes with mutations. Here we present the first approach integrating high-throughput datasets such as mRNA expression and large-scale protein-protein interaction networks to discover human disease relationships in a systematic and quantitative way. We discover 138 significant pathological similarities between 54 human diseases ranging from lung cancer, schizophrenia, and malaria. We also discovered a set of common pathways and processes within the cell that are dysregulated in at least half of the diseases. We infer that these processes correspond to a common response of the human system to a disease state. Interestingly, we find that many of the proteins in these pathways are already known to be targets of existing drugs. In fact, the drugs corresponding to these proteins are known to treat significantly more diseases than expected by chance highlighting the importance of these common molecular pathological pathways as prime therapeutic opportunities.
