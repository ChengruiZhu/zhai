The aim of this study is to investigate the effects of L-type calcium channels (LTCCs) on MPTP-induced dopamine (DA) neuron degeneration and iron accumulation in the substantia nigra (SN) of mice. By real-time PCR and western blots, we first quatified expressions of L-type Cav1.2 and Cav1.3 calcium channel α1 subunits in the SN of experimental mice treated with MPTP. We found that the expressions of Cav1.2 and Cav1.3 calcium channel α1 subunits markedly increased after MPTP treatment for 2 and 3 weeks. Secondly, we observed the effects of isradipine, a LTCC antagonist, on MPTP-induced DA neuron degeneration and iron accumulation in the SN. Our results showed that isradipine treatment prevented against MPTP-induced Cav1.2 and Cav1.3 calcium channel α1 subunits up-regulation in the SN. We also found that isradipine prevented against MPTP-induced DA neuron depletion in the SN and partly restored the DA content in the striatum. Moreover, we found that isradipine inhibited the increase of iron positive cells in the SN of the MPTP-treated mice. Finally, we investigated the effects of isradipine on cellular iron accumulation in the dopaminergic MES23.5 cell line. Our studies showed that MPP
