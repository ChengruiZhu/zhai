Axopods of the planktonic protozoan, Sticholonche, are used as oars to propel the organism through seawater. Within each axopod is an orgainzed array of microtubules which inserts into a dense material that assumes the form of the head of a hip joint. This material, in turn, articulates on the surface of the nucleus. Microfilaments, 20-30 A in diameter, connect the dense material associated with the microtubules to the surface of the nucleus, and they move the axopod by their contractions. The active phase of the movement may take as little as about 0.04 s and the recovery phase may take between 0.2 and 0.4 s. The microfilaments are not actin, as based on: (a) their small diameter, (b) the lack of decoration with heavy meromyosin, and (c) their ability to coil, spiral or fold during contraction. By the use of Thorotrast, we were able to demonstrate that the cell surface is deeply infolded, extending all the way to the hip joint. Here, there is a specialized membrane system that resembles the diad in skeletal muscle. From cytochemical tests and the use of ionophores and chelators, there is some evidence that the motile process may be controlled by calcium. This study demonstrates that, in at least one system, microtubules can be moves by contractile microfilaments attached to the dense material at there tips.
