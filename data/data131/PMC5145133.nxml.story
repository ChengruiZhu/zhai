Infectious disease modelling has become an established tool to inform decisions in infection control. For outbreaks that are confined to one geographical location, modelling approaches exist to analyse epidemic data, monitor infection incidence and assess the effect of control measures. For outbreaks that are spread over various adjacent districts or countries, such as the recent Ebola epidemic in West Africa, few modelling approaches are available that can analyse the spatiotemporal data. To study the epidemic spread within and between districts and countries, we have developed an analysis method that uses the full resolution of these data. The outbreak is represented as a network of local epidemics that are interconnected through travellers that are infected in one district, but observed to be infected in another. The main advantages of this method are that it needs little data and does not make strong assumptions on parameter values; a disadvantage is that it does not take underreporting into account. The spatiotemporal method can monitor the development of local epidemics, determine the extent of spatial spread, reveal the contribution of local and imported cases, and identify sources of introductions in uninfected areas. These results can help to effectively control emerging infections.
