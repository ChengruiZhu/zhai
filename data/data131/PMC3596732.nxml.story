Postoperative pain is the most common complaint after laparoscopic cholecystectomy. This study was carried out to evaluate whether preoperative administration of intramuscular dezocine can provide postoperative analgesia and reduce postoperative opioid consumption in patients undergoing laparoscopic cholecystectomy. Patients (ASA I or II) scheduled for laparoscopic cholecystectomy were randomly assigned into intramuscular dezocine group (group 1) or intramuscular normal saline group (group 2). Dezocine and equal volume normal saline were administered intramuscularly 10 min before the induction of anesthesia. After operation, the severity of postoperative pain, postoperative fentanyl requirement, incidence and severity of side-effects were assessed. Postoperative pain and postoperative patient-controlled fentanyl consumption were reduced significantly in group 1 compared with group 2. The incidence and severity of side effects were similar between the two groups. Preoperative single-dose administration of intramuscular dezocine 0.1 mg/kg was effective in reducing postoperative pain and postoperative patient-controlled fentanyl requirement in patients undergoing laparoscopic cholecystectomy.
