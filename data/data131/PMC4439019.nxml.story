Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is a persistent and critical threat to human health. Replication and pathogenesis of HIV is governed by information encoded in its single-stranded RNA genome. In addition to coding for viral proteins, the HIV genomic RNA forms base paired and higher-order structures that are critical for viral replication. It is likely that only a subset of functional RNA motifs has been identified. Here, we interrogate the structures of three diverse HIV-related viral genomes by nucleotide-resolution chemical probing. The three genomes include HIV-1, the virus that infects humans, and SIVcpz and SIVmac, which are progenitors for the main branches of the two HIV evolutionary groups. We used a structure-informed alignment approach to generate consensus models for base-paired secondary structures that are shared by these three HIV-related genomes. With this approach, we were able to recapitulate all known RNA structures and, additionally, discovered multiple previously undescribed structural elements that are clearly conserved among major HIV groups. We anticipate that the methods described here will be broadly useful for RNA structure motif discovery and, more immediately, for identification of RNA targets in HIV that are promising sites for therapeutic intervention.
