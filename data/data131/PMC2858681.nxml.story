Over the past decade the identification of synergies has become a prominent theme in motor neuroscience. Like other aspects of neural organization (e.g., vision) the control of coordinated movement is almost certainly hierarchical with synergies a key feature of this hypothesis. In pursuit of identifying synergies, whether flexible or hard-wired in biomechanical or physiological structures, many studies have analyzed variability with techniques of dimensionality reduction such as principal component analysis. Results have been interpreted as evidence for controlled variables in motor control. Our paper demonstrates that such analyses and conclusions based on these methods are exquisitely sensitive to the coordinates of the variables that are the basis for this analysis. As these coordinates are often chosen for convenience of measurement or analysis, any conclusions about neural control are therefore ambiguous at best. The development of coordinate-independent analyses was an important step in the development of modern physics. Here we highlight the problems induced by coordinate-dependency in studies of neural control and present initial steps towards coordinate-independent analyses relevant to computational biology. We critically examine an alternative method proposed to analyze variability for identification of structure and show that it is significantly less sensitive to assumed coordinates than conventional analyses.
