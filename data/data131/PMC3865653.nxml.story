 Aβ-42/Aβ-40 ratio). Recently, a novel gene/protein – ALZAS (ALZheimer ASsociated protein) – with a 79 amino acid sequence, containing the amyloid β-42 fragment (Aβ-42), the amyloid precursor protein (APP) transmembrane signal and a 12 amino acid C-terminal, not present in any other known APP alleles, has been discovered on chromosome 21 within the APP region. Reverse transcriptase-PCR revealed the expression of the transcript of this protein in the cortex and hippocampal regions as well as in lymphocytes of human AD patients. The expression of ALZAS is mirrored by a specific autoimmune response in AD patients, directed against the ct-12 end of the ALZAS-peptide but not against the Aβ-sequence. ELISA studies of plasma dectected highest titres of ALZAS in patients with mild cognitive impairment (presymptomatic AD), but only moderately increased titres in autopsy-confirmed AD, whereas low or undetectable ct-12 titres were found in cognitively intact age-matched subjects and young controls. The antigen, ALZAS protein, was detected in plasma in later clinical stages of AD. It is suggested that ALZAS represents an indicator in a dynamic equilibrium between both peripheral and brain degenerative changes in AD and may become a useful ‘non-invasive’ diagnostic marker
