There are numerous types of bone replacement materials used to regenerate atrophic alveolar processes before the elective intraosseous implantation. Properties of these materials differ one from another, therefore the choice of material should be thoroughly analysed as well as its type and texture in regard of intraoral conditions and the objective to be achieved. The study involved reconstruction of atrophic alveolar processes with allogeneic bone following unsuccessful use of synthetic and animal materials. The procedure of bone regeneration was performed with frozen bone block (case 1) and allogeneic bone granulate (cases 2, 3, 4) radiation-sterilised with 35Â kGy prepared by the Tissue Bank. In all of the presented cases after 3-month implant reorganisation optimal width of the process was obtained, which allowed implant embedment (case 1) or correct implant submergence in the osseous tissue, when implantation took place at the same time (case 2, 3, 4). Allogeneic bone material both, in the form of a block as well as granulate, seems to be an adequate alternative for other materials used in order to widen the bone of the alveolar process, particularly in difficult, complicated cases, where the first regeneration procedure was not successful.
