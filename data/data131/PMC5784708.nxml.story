The incidence of delayed graft function in patients undergoing kidney transplantation remains significant. Optimal fluid therapy has been shown to decrease delayed graft function after renal transplantation. Traditionally, the perioperative volume infusion regimen in this patient population has been guided by central venous pressure as an estimation of the patientâ€™s volume status and mean arterial pressure, but this is based on sparse evidence from mostly retrospective observational studies. Excessive volume infusion to the point of no further fluid responsiveness can damage the endothelial glycocalyx and is no longer considered to be the best approach. However, achievement of adequate flow to maintain sufficient tissue perfusion without maximization of cardiac filling remains a challenge. Novel minimally invasive technologies seem to reliably assess volume responsiveness, heart function and perfusion adequacy. Prospective comparative clinical studies are required to better understand the use of dynamic analyses of flow parameters for adequate fluid management in kidney transplant recipients. We review perioperative fluid assessment techniques and discuss conventional and novel monitoring strategies in the kidney transplant recipient.
