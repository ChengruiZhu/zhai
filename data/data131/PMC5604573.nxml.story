Resveratrol (Res) is a common phytoalexin present in a few edible materials, such as grape skin, peanuts, and red wine. Evidence has shown the beneficial effects of Res on human health, which may be attributed to its anti-inflammatory activity. However, the poor aqueous solubility of Res limits its therapeutic effectiveness. Therefore, the use of nanostructured delivery systems for Res, such as liquid-crystalline systems, could be beneficial. In this study, we aimed to develop, characterize, and determine the in vivo effectiveness of Res-loaded liquid-crystalline systems. Systems containing copaiba balsam oil, polyethylene glycol-40 hydrogenated castor oil, and water were designed. Results of polarized light microscopy, small-angle X-ray scattering, texture-profile analysis, and flow-rheology analysis showed that the Res-loaded liquid-crystalline system had a lamellar structure, textural and mechanical (hardness, compressibility, and adhesiveness) properties, and behaved as a non-Newtonian fluid, showing pseudoplastic behavior upon skin application. Furthermore, all liquid-crystalline systems presented bioadhesive properties that may have assisted in maintaining the anti-inflammatory activity of Res, since the topical application of the Res-loaded lamellar mesophase liquid crystals resulted in edema inhibition in a carrageenan-induced paw-inflammation mouse model. Therefore, Res-loaded lamellar mesophases represent a promising new therapeutic approach for inhibition of skin inflammation.
