Serious concerns have been expressed about potential health risks of Nano silver containing consumer products (AgNPs) therefore regulatory health risk assessment on such nanoparticles has become mandatory for the safe use of AgNPsinbiomedicalproducts with special concerns to the mutagenic potentials. In this study, we examined the inhibitory and mutagenicity effects of AgNPs in three different sizes of three colloidal AgNPs by Minimal Inhibitory concentration (MIC), Minimal Bactericidal Concentration (MBC) and Bacterial Reverse Mutation Assay (Ames test).All samples were characterized by transmission electron microscopy (TEM), X-Ray Diffraction (XRD) and Dynamic Light Scattering (DLS). DLS analysis showed lack of large agglomeration of the AgNPs and TEM results showed the spherical AgNPswith the average sizes of 15, 19.6, 21.8 nms. Furthermore the XRD analysis showed the crystalline samples with a face centered cubic structure of pure silver.AmestestresultsonColloidal silver nanoparticles showed lack of any mutation in TA100, TA98, YG1029S. typhymuriumstrains.In addition colloidal silver nanoparticles reduced the mutation ratesin all three strains in a concentration dependent manner .This finding creates a new issue in the possible antimutagenic effects of colloidal AgNPsas a new pharmaceutical productwhich should be consideredinfuture studiesby focusing onthephysicochemical properties of AgNPs.
