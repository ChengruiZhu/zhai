The aim of the study was to analyze how the expression of MCP-1, HIF-1α, NOX2, ERK1, ERK2, and Mn-SOD mRNA, which are related to inflammation and oxidative stress and which can influence the accumulation of macrophage in obese adipose tissue, differed according to a high-fat diet, change of diet composition, and exercise. Obesity was induced using a high-fat diet (45% fat) for five weeks. This investigation analyzed how the change of diet composition for eight weeks and long-term exercise training affected the expression of mRNA in epididymal white adipose tissue. For the experiment, 56 four-week-old C57BL/6 mice were used. Their epididymal white adipose tissue was extracted and used in RT-PCR analysis to find the expression level of mRNA. A high-fat diet for 13 weeks showed a significant increase in the expression of MCP-1, HIF-1α, NOX2, and ERK1 mRNA in epididymal adipose tissue. Change in diet composition and exercise decreased the expression of MCP-1, HIF-1α, NOX2, and ERK1 mRNA. Particularly, the group combining a high-fat diet and exercise had a significant increase in the expression of Mn-SOD mRNA in epididymal adipose tissue; however, it showed a significant decrease in MCP-1, HIF-1α, and NOX2. These results suggest that the antioxidant effect and weight loss by exercise decreased inflammation and oxidative stress.
