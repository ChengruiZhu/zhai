Fifty extracted single rooted teeth were selected for this study. After decoronation, the root canals of these teeth were prepared to the size F3 (30 no.) using rotary ProTaper file system. These samples were randomly divided into four groups. Group 1 (n=20) were filled completely with water based calcium hydroxide (CH), Group 2 (n=20) were filled with oil based CH using lentulo spiral, Group 3 (n=5) - the positive control group received the CH as intracanal medication, but no subsequent removal, Group 4 (n=5) - the negative control did not receive CH placement. Further on, Group 1 and Group 2 were divided into four sub-groups (n=5). In sub-group A we performed conventional syringe irrigation with side-vented needle sub-group B) manual dynamic agitation, sub-group C sonic agitation using endoactivator, sub-group D passive ultrasonic irrigation (PUI). Roots were split longitudinally into mesial and distal halves. Digital images of the root canal walls were acquired by a Dental Operating Microscope (DOM) and assessed by using a scoring criteria at different thirds (coronal, middle and apical) of the root canal as follows: score 1, score 2, score 3, and score 4. Data were analyzed applying one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) and Tukeyâ€™s multiple comparison tests at a 95% confidence interval (P < 0.05).
