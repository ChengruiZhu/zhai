Although relatively rare, melanoma accounts for 2 % of cancer diagnoses globally and accounts for about 1 % of all cancer deaths. Worldwide, the annual incidence of melanoma is 272,000 cases which vary hugely, ranging from Japan where it is incredibly infrequent, to Queensland, Australia, where it is nearly 100 times higher. Based on epidemiology and laboratory studies, there is compelling evidence suggesting that seaweed might be protective against different types of cancers such as breast cancer in seaweed consuming populations. By comparing countries where melanoma is more common with countries where it is infrequent, it is possible to construct a hypothesis for how consuming brown seaweeds which may hold clues to the differences in melanoma susceptibility between Japanese and Western nations. Unlike in these other countries, where melanoma incidence has increased dramatically over the last two decades, in Japan, rates have remained remarkably low and stable. There is limited evidence from clinical studies and animal models that have used whole seaweed or isolated fractions from seaweed and measured changes in biomarkers. They have demonstrated the effectiveness of seaweed at inhibiting melanoma development and progression. In this review, the various results will be described. Although there are several effective fractions, it is proposed that consuming whole seaweeds may hold additional benefits that could be lost by consuming only a single extract.
