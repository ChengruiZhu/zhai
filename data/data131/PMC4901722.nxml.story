A web-based program was created to collect a knee pain history and generate a differential diagnosis for ambulatory patients with knee pain. The diagnoses generated by the program were linked to informative content which was immediately available to the patient in order to allow them to learn more about each diagnosis. Prior to coming to their office appointment, the patient was given the link for the program. They entered their history into the program which then generated a list of most likely causes for the patient's knee pain based on their history. The program has the capability of generating 21 common knee diagnoses. After exploring the informative content, the patient selected which diagnosis or diagnoses they believed were the most likely cause of their pain. Despite the program generating a limited list, the patient had the ability to select from all 21 diagnoses capable of being generated by the program when selecting the diagnosis(es) they believed was the cause of their knee pain. Within days of completing the program, each patient was examined by a board-certified orthopaedic surgeon. The physician was blinded to the differential diagnosis generated by the program as well as the diagnosis(es) selected by the patient. A third party was responsible for comparing the diagnosis(es) generated by the program with that selected by the patient as well as the final diagnosis(es) determined by the physician. The diagnosis(es) provided by the physician were considered the correct diagnosis for the patient. The level of matching between the patient selected diagnosis and the physician's diagnosis determined the ability of the patient to correctly diagnose the cause of their knee pain.
