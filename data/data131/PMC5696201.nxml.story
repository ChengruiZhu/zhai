Chemerin is dysregulation in numerous solid cancers. However, only little is known about the role of chemerin in acute myeloid leukemia (AML). In this study, we aimed to investigate the expression and clinical significance of recently described chemerin in acute myeloid leukemia (AML). The expression of chemerin in 149 patients with de novo AML and 35 normal controls was quantified by Real-time quantitative PCR (RQ-PCR). Chemerin was down-expressed in AML compared with controls (P=0.042). A receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve revealed that chemerin expression could differentiate patients with AML from control subjects (AUC=0.611, 95% CI: 0.490-0.732; P=0.042) respectively. The cohort of AML patients was divided into two groups according to the cut-off value of 0.0826 (79% sensitivity and 54% specificity, respectively). In addition, the AML patients with low chemerin expression had significantly shorter overall survival (OS) than those with high chemerin expression (P=0.049). Moreover, multivariate survival analysis confirmed that chemerin was an independent prognostic factor for AML patients. In conclusion, downregulation of chemerin might be a useful diagnostic and prognostic factor for AML patients.
