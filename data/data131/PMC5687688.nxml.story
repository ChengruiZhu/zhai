=1683) who received hepatectomies in the liver surgery department of Peking Union Medical College Hospital from April 2008 to August 2014 were retrospectively analyzed. Possible PHLF patients were screened according to the criteria of the International Study Group of Liver Surgery (ISGLS). Subsequently, other PHLF evaluation methods, including Child-Pugh score, “50-50” criteria, Model for End-Stage Liver Disease (MELD) score, and Clavien-Dindo classification were used to assess the suspected PHLF patients, and statistical analysis was performed for correlation of these methods with clinical prognoses. Using ISGLS grading, 40 cases (2.38%) were suspected to have PHLF, among whom 5 (0.30%) patients died. Of the 40 cases there were 9 patients of ISGLS grade A, 21 of grade B, and 10 of grade C. Among the entire group, Child-Pugh scoring showed 3 patients in grade A, 35 in grade B, and 2 in grade C, while only 5 patients met the “50-50” criteria. Interestingly, MELD scores ≥11 points were found only in 3 cases. Twenty-eight patients were classified as Clavien-Dindo grade I, 8 as grade II, 3 as grade III, and 1 as grade IV. Prothrombin time on postoperative day 5 (PT5), ISGLS, and Clavien-Dindo were found to have significant correlation with the prognosis of PHLF (
