PROXIMA is an observational, multicenter, cross-sectional and prospective cohort study conducted at 25 centers in Italy, in outpatient settings. The study consists of two phases: 1) a cross-sectional phase plans to enroll 600 patients with severe allergic asthma, in step 4 therapy as per GINA guidelines, aged ≥18 years, needing a step up in therapy, and 2) a longitudinal phase on patients who will start omalizumab add-on therapy per clinician’s judgment at baseline visit (approximately 180–240 patients). The primary variable of the cross-sectional phase is the proportion of patients with severe asthma presenting with perennial form of allergy (skin prick test or in vitro test). The primary variable of longitudinal phase is proportion of patients who achieve disease control (assessed by Asthma Control Questionnaire [ACQ]) with omalizumab at 6 months, and maintain it at 12 months. Secondary variables are patient compliance to omalizumab, patient-reported perception of cognitive and emotional impact of the illness, assessed by Brief Illness Perception Questionnaire (Brief IPQ) and the health related quality of life evaluated by the EuroQoL 5D-3 L (EQ-5D-3 L). Safety endpoints will be recorded during the course of the study. Patients participating in the longitudinal phase will be enrolled for ancillary study if they provide additional informed consent. Protein species in complex mixtures will be identified using innovative MudPIT (Multidimensional Protein Identification Technology) method.
