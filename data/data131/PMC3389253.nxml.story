Optical coherence tomography (OCT) is a high-resolution imaging technique that is increasingly used for intracoronary imaging to characterize coronary atherosclerotic plaques and vascular responses after coronary stent implantation. Introduction of optical frequency-domain imaging (OFDI; second generation OCT) has simplified practical use of this novel imaging modality resulting in a more widespread availability in interventional cardiology. Here we highlight recent insights into the acute and chronic vascular response after coronary stent implantation by OCT imaging. OCT provides cross-sectional images with approximately 10-fold higher resolution as compared to intravascular-ultrasound (IVUS), allowing for precise evaluation of tissue coverage and malapposition of coronary stent struts. More than 30 studies using OCT to compare vascular responses to different stents have now been reported. Recent studies have examined the relation between OCT-image characteristics and tissue composition around stent struts. OCT is used for evaluation of novel stent concepts, such as bioengineered stents and bioabsorbable stents, where it provides more accurate information than IVUS. While intracoronary OCT imaging is further developed, including faster 3D-OCT-image-reconstruction, larger OCT studies/registries with standardized analysis will provide more insights into clinical implications of observations from OCT-imaging after coronary stent implantation.
