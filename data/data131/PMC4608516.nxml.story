Invited for this month's cover picture is the group of Professor Mark Peczuh at the University of Connecticut. The cover picture compares the rearrangement of a small molecule to the process of turning a stuffed animal inside out. The recycled, inside-out stuffed animals are both artistic and philosophically provocative. They capture the essence of the rearrangement reaction because the compounds themselves turn inside out over the course of the reaction, extending the diversity of products that can arise from simple starting materials. Small molecules often have functional groups with latent reactivity; under the appropriate conditions, those groups can react with other compounds (e.g., reagents) and also with other groups in the same molecule in an intramolecular reaction. The research team found that the epoxidation of some highly functionalized spiroketal compounds promoted rearrangements of their structures that turned them inside out. Some of the features of the products led them to use X-ray crystallography or a combination of computer-assisted structure elucidation, computation, and a new version of the 1,1-ADEQUATE NMR experiment to determine their structures.
