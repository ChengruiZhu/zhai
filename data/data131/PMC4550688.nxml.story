The objective was to determine the effect of nutritional milieu of isolated stromal vascular (SV) cells on proliferative capacity of preadipocytes, and adipogenic and lipogenic capacity in adipocytes in vitro. Proliferation of the preadipocytes increased over time with 48 and 72 h being greater than 24 h; however, preadipocytes from steers supplemented with corn (LC) had lower proliferation rates compared with those without corn grain supplementation (L) at 72 h. Adipocyte cultures isolated from LC group had higher mean diameter on d 4 and 6, and higher mean volume on d 0, 4, 6, and 12 of culture. Adipocytes from steers supplemented with corn grain (LC) had lower expression of key adipogenic genes during extended days in culture. The results show that prior nutritional treatment of the donor animal used to isolate SV cultures alters their proliferative, adipogenic, and lipogenic capacity in culture. These differences may be related to lower induction/expression of AP2 gene in the adipose cultures from corn supplemented group. Corn grain supplementation to steers grazing legumes could have stimulated more active adipogenic progenitor cells to differentiate, which would leave fewer behind in the SV pool for subsequent isolation.
