Apoptosis, a major form of programmed cell death, plays a crucial role in shaping organs during development and controls homeostasis and tissue integrity throughout life. Defective apoptosis is often involved in cancer development and progression. Current understanding of externally triggered apoptosis is that death results from the activation of one out of two parallel signal transduction pathways. This leads to a classification of cell lines in two main types: type I and II. In the context of chemotherapy, understanding the cell-line-specific molecular mechanisms of apoptosis is important since this could guide drug usage. Biologists investigate the details of signal transduction pathways often at the single cell level and construct models to assess their current understanding. However, no systematic approach is employed to check the consistency of model predictions and experimental observations on various cell lines. Here we propose to use a formal specification language to encode the observed properties and a systematic approach to test whether model predictions are consistent with expected properties. Such property-guided model development and model revision approaches should guarantee an optimal use of the often heterogeneous experimental data.
