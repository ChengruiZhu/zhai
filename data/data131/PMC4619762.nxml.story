Our experience with the visual world allows us to group image elements that belong to the same perceptual object and to segregate them from other objects and the background. If subjects learn to group contour elements, this experience influences neuronal activity in early visual cortical areas, including the primary visual cortex (V1). Learning presumably depends on alterations in the pattern of connections within and between areas of the visual cortex. However, the processes that control changes in connectivity are not well understood. Here we present the first computational model that can train a neural network to integrate collinear contour elements into elongated curves and to trace a curve through the visual field. The new learning algorithm trains fully recurrent neural networks, provided the connectivity causes the networks to reach a stable state. The model reproduces the behavioral performance of monkeys trained in these tasks and explains the patterns of neuronal activity in the visual cortex that emerge during learning, which is remarkable because the only feedback for the model is a reward for successful trials. We discuss a number of the model predictions that can be tested in future neuroscientific work.
