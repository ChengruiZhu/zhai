The aim of this study was to explore the lived experience of the symptoms, health, and illness reported by patients recovering after pancreaticoduodenectomy ad modum Whipple due to pancreatic or periampullary cancer. Thirteen patients with pancreatic or periampullary cancer who underwent pancreaticoduodenectomy ad modum Whipple between 2006 and 2008 were interviewed during postoperative recovery. Data were analysed using the phenomenological-hermeneutic method. The structural analysis of patient experiences revealed that recovery after pancreaticoduodenectomy was described as recapturing everyday life, being healthy, and looking to the future. Participants experienced symptoms but did not dwell on them, instead they stated that their general health was good. They strived to regain their former precancer selves and be a part of as well as contribute to the social context. Overall, the participants' view of the future was positive, and improvement in their health generated further confidence and encouragement. This study suggests that persons recovering from pancreaticoduodenectomy ad modum Whipple due to a pancreatic or periampullary tumour experience health despite postoperative symptoms. They manage their symptoms by means of different strategies and express a positive view of the future. Nurses working with such patients should adopt a person-centred approach focusing on patient perspectives, participation, and possibilities.
