Gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs) originate from the mesenchymal tissue of the gastrointestinal tract. The pathogenesis of GIST is associated with the mutational activation of the receptor tyrosine kinase cluster of differentiation (CD)117 or platelet-derived growth factor receptor-Î±. Overall, ~60% of GISTs occur in the stomach. Clinically, GISTs may coexist with various types of cancer, including liver cancer, pancreatic tumors and lymphoma, either synchronously or metachronously. The present study reports the case of a patient with the synchronous occurrence of a CD117-positive GIST and acute myeloid leukemia. A 69-year-old man was hospitalized for heart palpitations and dizziness, and was diagnosed with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) by bone marrow aspiration and flow cytometry analysis. An abdominal computed tomograpy and gastroscopy revealed the presence of GIST. The patient received chemotherapy in combination with imatinib (400 mg/day), and the mass was removed 2 months later. To the best of our knowledge, the present study is the first reported case of the synchronous development of a CD117-positive GIST and AML. Additional studies are required in order to understand the association between GIST and hematological malignancies.
