) exposed to two irrigation treatments. One treatment was not irrigated until significant stress was detected via water potential by pressure bombing. In the second treatment trees were normally irrigated with ~5.84 cm of water each week to match evapotranspirational loss. Midday stem water potential readings were regularly collected to assess the level of water stress experienced by the trees. Measurements of individual leaves and their corresponding internodes were taken along tagged proleptic and epicormic shoots three times per week from the beginning to the end of two growing seasons. Leaf measurements were used to calculate the phyllochron. The phyllochron increased as the season progressed. This increase could not be explained by traditionally accepted effects of temperature or light. The more vigorous epicormic shoots added leaves significantly faster than proleptic shoots on trees in both water deficit and normally irrigated treatments. Additionally, epicormic shoots produced leaves with significantly greater leaf length and leaf area. Midday stem water potentials were more negative in trees in the water deficit treatments only after proleptic shoots stopped growing. The phyllochron did increase while leaf length and leaf area decreased on epicormic shoots of deficit irrigated trees in the 2010 growing season. The phyllochron of both shoot types gradually increased over the season, which was primarily due to an endogenous rank or shoot ageing effect. Differences between shoot types indicate that the phyllochron is variable among shoots on the same tree and is associated with shoot vigour. Water deficit increased the phyllochron and over all shoot growth rate.
