The use of general (face-mask inhalation and intravenous) anesthesia has been the method of choice for tympanostomy tube insertion in children. However, there is no exact guideline for the choice of anesthesia method and there is no evidence to support the use of one anesthesia method over another. Clinically, the anesthesia method used to be decided by old customs and the surgeon's blind faith that children cannot bear tympanostomy tube insertion under local anesthesia. Clinicians should keep in mind that pediatric anesthesia has a potential risk. Despite infrequent serious complications, their seriousness necessitates that sedation or general anesthesia should be done by an anesthesiologist and thus children requiring tympanostomy tube insertion should be referred to secondary or tertiary hospitals, even if they have been followed by a primary care physician for a long time. Previous evidence showed that local anesthesia is appropriate for tympanostomy tube insertion in selected children, especially in children older than 5 years are older. Proper choice of anesthesia method is helpful for both patient and medical service provider. Local anesthesia can give psychological relief to children and their parent. It is easier for the medical service providers to schedule the operation and allocate the medical resources in their hospital. Local anesthesia can reduce individual, social, and national burdens for the health care services.
