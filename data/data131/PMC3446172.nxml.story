Sixty-three children aged between a day and six years (median 5 years) comprising 38 males and 25 females (ratio 1.5:1) were managed. Upper limbs involvement, 18 (28.6%), and face/neck, 12 (19.1%), were most common and were present at birth in 27 (42.9%) babies, appeared between 2-3 weeks in 32 (50.8%), and after six months in 4 (6.3%). Cavernous hemangioma in 19 (30.2%) children, mixed cavernous/strawberry in 31 (49.2%) and strawberry in 13 (20.6), were the major types that ranged from spot-like to extensive huge lesions measuring 12Ã—15 cm in diameter. Failure of 46 (65.1%) cases to respond to non operative treatment, ulceration in 3 (4.8%), infection in 5 (7.9%) and hemorrhage in 2 (3.2%) were indications for surgical intervention. Surgical options included complete excision and primary wound closure in 34 (54%) children, immediate skin graft after complete excision in 10 (15.9%), injection sclerotherapy in 2 (3.2%), serial ligation of feeder vessels in 2 (3.2%), and conservative treatment in 5 (7.9%). Excision and primary wound closure gave better outcome compared with others (P<0.0001). No mortality was recorded on 1-6 years follow-up but ugly scar, 8 (12.7%) and limb deformity, 3 (4.8%) were problems.
