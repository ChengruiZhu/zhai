Elastosis perforans serpiginosa is a rare skin disease characterized by transepidermal elimination of abnormal elastic fibers. This condition classically presents as small papules arranged in serpiginous or annular patterns on the neck, face, arms, or other flexural areas. While these lesions may spontaneously resolve, they often persist for longer periods of time. Though numerous treatment modalities have been described in the literature, most are not very effective. A 35-year-old man presented to Gangnam Severance Hospital with a 2-year history of skin eruptions on his neck, which were refractory to topical antifungal or steroid treatment. On examination, the patient showed multiple crusted and erythematous papules arranged in an annular pattern with central clearing. A biopsy specimen revealed acanthosis with notable transepidermal elimination of nuclear debris and eosinophilic degenerated elastic fibers from the dermis via an epidermal channel. Verhoeff-van Gieson staining showed dense clumps of altered elastic fibers in the papillary dermis. Based on these findings, a diagnosis of elastosis perforans serpisinosa was made. Treatment with topical 0.05% tretinoin application for 6 months resulted in no improvement.
