Molecular computers (also called DNA computers), as an alternative to traditional electronic computers, are smaller in size but more energy efficient, and have massive parallel processing capacity. However, DNA computers may not outperform electronic computers owing to their higher error rates and some limitations of the biological laboratory. The stickers model, as a typical DNA-based computer, is computationally complete and universal, and can be viewed as a bit-vertically operating machine. This makes it attractive for silicon implementation. Inspired by the information processing method on the stickers computer, we propose a novel parallel computing model called DEM (DNA Electronic Computing Model) on System-on-a-Programmable-Chip (SOPC) architecture. Except for the significant difference in the computing medium—transistor chips rather than bio-molecules—the DEM works similarly to DNA computers in immense parallel information processing. Additionally, a plasma display panel (PDP) is used to show the change of solutions, and helps us directly see the distribution of assignments. The feasibility of the DEM is tested by applying it to compute a maximum clique problem (MCP) with eight vertices. Owing to the limited computing sources on SOPC architecture, the DEM could solve moderate-size problems in polynomial time.
