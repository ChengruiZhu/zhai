PDZ domain proteins (PDZs) act as adapters in organizing functional protein complexes. Through dynamic interactions, PDZs play a key role in mediating key cellular functions in the cell, and they are linked to currently challenging diseases including Alzheimer's, Parkinson's and cancer. Moreover, they are associated with allosteric regulations in mediating signaling. Therefore, it is critical to have knowledge of how the allosteric transition occurs in PDZs. We investigate the allosteric response of the two most studied PDZs, PSD-95 and hPTP1E, using the perturbation response scanning (PRS) approach. The method treats the protein as an elastic network and uses linear response theory (LRT) to obtain residue fluctuations upon exerting directed random forces on selected residues. With this efficient and fast approach, we identify the key residues that mediate long-range communication and find the allosteric pathways. Although the structures of PSD-95 and hPTP1E are very similar, our analysis predicts that their allosteric pathways are different. We also observe a significant change in allosteric pathways and a decrease in binding affinity upon removal of the distal Î±3 helix of PSD-95. This approach enables us to understand how dynamic interactions play an important role in allosteric regulations.
