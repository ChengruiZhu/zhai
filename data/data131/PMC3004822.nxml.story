STZ induced diabetes caused a significant increase in blood glucose levels. It also resulted in an increase in the levels of homocysteine and cardiac damage markers, like Troponin-1, CK-MB, CK-NAC, uric acid, LDH and alkaline phosphatase. Moreover, there was an increase in the levels of proinflammatory cytokines like TNF-α, IFN-γ, and TGF-β and decrease in the levels of IL-4 and IL-10. Additionally, there was increase in the levels of cholesterol, triglycerides, LDL, VLDL and a decrease in HDL in these animals. There was an altered antioxidant enzyme profile which resulted in a notable increase in the levels of oxidative stress markers like lipid peroxides, nitric oxide and carbonylated proteins. Compared with the untreated diabetic rats, AZL treatment significantly reduced the levels of troponin-1 (P < 0.05), CK-MB (P < 0.05), CK-NAC (P < 0.05), uric acid (P < 0.05), LDH (P < 0.05) and alkaline phosphatase (P < 0.05). It also reduced the levels of the TNF-α (P < 0.05), IFN-γ (P < 0.05), and TGF-β (P < 0.05) and increased the levels of IL-4 (P < 0.05). A significant decrease in the serum cholesterol (P < 0.05), triglycerides (P < 0.05), LDL (P < 0.05), VLDL (P < 0.05) and a significant rise in levels of HDL (P < 0.05) was also observed. Treatment with AZL corrected the distorted antioxidant enzyme profile resulting in a significant decrease in the levels of lipid peroxides, nitric oxide and carbonylated proteins.
