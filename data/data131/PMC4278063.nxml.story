Recurrence of viral hepatitis after liver transplantation (LT) can progress to graft failure and lead to a decrease in long-term survival. Recently, there have been remarkable improvement in the treatment of chronic hepatitis B (CHB) using potent antiviral agents. Combination of hepatitis B immunoglobulin and potent antiviral therapy has brought marked advances in the management of CHB for liver transplant recipients. Post-transplant antiviral therapy for hepatitis C virus infection is generally reserved for patients showing progressive disease. Acheiving a sustained virological response in patients with LT greatly ameliorates graft and overall survival, however this only occurs in 30% of transplant recipient using pegylated interferon and ribavirin (RBV). Direct acting antivirals such as protease inhibitors, polymerase or other non-structural proteins inhibitors are anticipated to establish the new standard of care for transplant recipients. In liver transplant recipients, hepatitis E virus infection is an uncommon disease. However, it can lead to chronic hepatitis and cirrhosis and may require retransplantation. Recently, 3-month course of RBV monotherapy has been reported as an effective treatment. This review focuses on the recent management and therapeutic approaches of viral hepatitis in liver transplant recipient.
