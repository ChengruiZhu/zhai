 The kinetic effects resulting from changes in the medium ionic strength on reactions involving trypsin or α-chymotrypsin are different. The reaction rate increases continuously as the ionic strength increases with α-chymotrypsin. With trypsin, the rate increases at low ionic strengths but as the ionic strength further increases a gradual inhibitory effect is observed. The effects produced by different salts of various valence types (from uni-univalent to uni-trivalent or tri-univalent) are essentially the same, and they are a function of the square root of the ionic strength. The quantitative differences among the various salts may be accounted for on the basis of individual properties of the ions, such as the size of the hydrated ion, "association," etc. The effects of salts on the enzymic reactions described herein are amenable to the same electrostatic treatment applicable to non-enzymatic reactions. By applying Brönsted's basic kinetic concepts and the Debye-Hückel law of electrolyte activity, it appears that the salt effects are mainly due to changes in the dissociation of ionizable groups. This appears to be a general method for analyzing the effect of inorganic ions on enzymic reactions.
