Over 30% of the human proteome consists of proteins embedded in biological membranes. These proteins are critical in many processes such as transport of materials in and out of the cell and transmitting signals to other cells in the body. They are implicated in a large number of diseases; in fact, they are targeted by over 50% of pharmaceutical drugs on the market. Since the membrane environment makes experimental structure determination extremely difficult, there is a need for alternative, computational approaches. Here, we describe a new framework, RosettaMP, for computational modeling and design of membrane protein structures, integrated in the Rosetta3 software suite. This framework includes a set of tools for representing the membrane bilayer, moving the protein, altering its sequence, and estimating free energies. We demonstrate tools to predict the effects of mutations, refine atomic details of protein structures, simulate protein binding, and assemble symmetric complexes, all in the membrane bilayer. Taken together, these applications demonstrate the potential of RosettaMP to facilitate membrane protein structure prediction and design, enabling us to understand the function of these proteins and their role in human disease.
