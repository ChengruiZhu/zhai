=82.3%, p<0.05). Thereafter, the data was pooled by a random effect model. The combined standardized mean difference (SMD) was −0.24 with its 95%CI −0.40~0.09, (p<0.05). The results indicated that the post-treatment serum creatinine in experiment group was significant lower than that of control group (p<0.05); Eight studies reported tripterygium glycoside-associated toxicity such as liver function damage, gastrointestinal reactions and menstrual disorders. With no statistical heterogeneity among the studies, the data was pooled by fixed effect model. The pooled OR=6.42 (95%CI 2.23~18.48, p<0.05). The pooled results showed the tripterygium glycoside- associated toxicity incidence rate was significant higher in the experiment group than that of the control group (p<0.05); There were no publication bias for effect size of total efficacy, 24h urinary protein, and serum creatinine. However, for tripterygium glycoside-related toxicity, the publication bias was significant (t=-3.55, p<0.05). Conclusion The present evidence shows that tripterygium glycosides can improve clinical efficacy, reduce the 24h urinary protein and serum creatinine, but that they increase the tripterygium glycoside-related toxicity in treatment of stage IV diabetic nephropathy.
