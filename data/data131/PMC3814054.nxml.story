Percutaneous vertebroplasty (PVP) is widely used in the treatment of painful osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures with the injection of PMMA cement, and the controversy for PMMA damage to the osteoporotic bone tissue and to affect the fractures repairing never stops. 72 old female rabbits, each age 3.0~3.5 y, rabbits were assigned randomly to two groups of thirty-six each; PMMA cement were injected into vertebral body in rabbits via mimic PVP, sacrificed at 1 h, 24 h, 3 d, 7 d, 4 w, and 12 w. The expression VEGF and collagen type I, the tissue response, and repair reaction in the interface between PMMA and bone tissue were observed dynamically with RT-PCR and western blot technique; the osteocalcin expression were studied by immunohistochemistry. Compared with the control group, the expression of collagen I increased at 1 hour and was higher from 24 h to 3 d. From 4 weeks to 12 weeks after injection of PMMA. The expression of VEGF decreased at 1 hour and 24 hours, significantly increased at 3 days, decreased once again at 7 days, then increased significantly at 4–12 weeks. The osteocalcin expression continued to increase during 4 to 12 week. PMMA would not cause local bone permanent necrosis, and interface injury repairing cycle could be prolonged in a vertebroplasty.
