Genome-wide association (GWA) analyses seek to relate variation of phenotype to underlying (and presumably causative) variation in genotype. Recently, many GWA studies have identified candidate genes underlying disease phenotypes such as diabetes, heart disease, and cancer risk. Many groups have also performed GWA using variation in gene expression levels as the input phenotype. These expression QTL (eQTL) studies have provided important clues as to the genetic basis of gene expression regulation. Here, we perform an eQTL study in mouse adipose tissue. We then developed a systematic analysis method to relate these patterns of eQTL associations to biological pathways. Based on this approach, we identified putative roles for thousands of candidate upstream regulators and candidate pathway members in relation to specific biological pathways. Statistical analysis showed that these predictions were highly enriched for true genetic modulators of these pathways. Based on these predictions, we also experimentally validated a role for one particular gene, cyclin H, in the regulation of oxidative phosphorylation. These findings illustrate a new analysis method for relating eQTL studies to biological pathways and identify cyclin H as a novel key regulator of cellular energy metabolism.
