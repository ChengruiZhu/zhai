The RE-1 silencing transcription factor (REST) binds to DNA and has been shown to repress neuronal genes in non-neuronal systems, but more recent studies have expanded its functions much beyond this. At the molecular level, REST acts cooperatively with other proteins to execute its transcriptional regulatory roles. The dynamics of REST binding and cofactor recruitment and its association with the underlying DNA sequence remain unclear. Here, we have applied chromatin immunoprecipitation and deep sequencing to identify REST binding across 16 different cell types, including neurons. Our results demonstrate that REST binding events are dynamic and quite distinct among cells and that REST binding is generally associated with low gene expression. Closer examination finds that the context of the DNA sequence at REST bound sites is associated with the lower expression of REST-associated targets and that different contexts correlate with different cofactor recruitment. These in turn have an effect on the expression of REST targets. REST targets in human neurons, however, are drastically different from those in other cell types. These findings provide insights into the effect of genomic and cellular contexts on REST's diverse functions and point to distinct and novel roles for REST in neurons.
