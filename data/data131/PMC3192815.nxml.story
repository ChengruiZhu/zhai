Intracellular compartmentalisation via membrane-delimited organelles is a fundamental feature of the eukaryotic cell. Understanding its origins and specialisation into functionally distinct compartments is a major challenge in evolutionary cell biology. We focus on the Rab enzymes, critical organisers of the trafficking pathways that link the endomembrane system. Rabs form a large family of evolutionarily related proteins, regulating distinct steps in vesicle transport. They mark pathways and organelles due to their specific subcellular and tissue localisation. We propose a solution to the problem of identifying and annotating Rabs in hundreds of sequenced genomes. We developed an accurate bioinformatics pipeline that is able to take into account pre-existing and often inconsistent, manual annotations. We made it available to the community in form of a web tool, as well as a database containing thousands of Rabs assigned to sub-families, which yields clear functional predictions. Thousands of Rabs allow for a new level of analysis. We illustrate this by characterising for the first time the global evolutionary dynamics of the Rab family. We dated the emergence of subfamilies and suggest that the Rab family expands by duplicates acquiring new functions.
