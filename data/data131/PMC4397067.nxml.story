Kinetic models enable understanding and prediction of the dynamic behaviour of enzymatic reactions. Different frameworks have been proposed to parameterize enzymatic reactions using approximate expressions while maintaining thermodynamic consistency. Approximate expressions have been particularly sought and used, as kinetic expressions typically require large amounts of data to fit their parameters. The latter however ignores real kinetic behaviours and incurs in loss of generality. To overcome these limitations, here we present a novel framework GRASP for exploring the kinetic behaviour of enzymatic reactions under uncertainty based on parameter sampling. By formulating the appropriate thermodynamic constraints and using minimal biochemical reference data, our framework is capable of parameterizing the kinetics of any oligomeric enzyme without sacrificing complexity. To this task, we integrated the generalized MWC model and the elementary reaction formalism, providing a thermodynamically-safe and easy-to-sample parameterization. Application of our framework provided valuable insights into how reactions are regulated under non-equilibrium conditions. We also showed how our approach can be used to describe and understand complex kinetic behaviours of enzymes involved in key regulatory steps of cell metabolism. Overall, this framework enables systematic exploration of the feasible kinetic behaviour of enzymes.
