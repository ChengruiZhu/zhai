Current GWA studies typically only explain a small fraction of heritable variation in complex traits, resulting in speculation that a large fraction of variation in such traits may be due to rare alleles of large effect (RALE). The most parsimonious evolutionary mechanism that results in an inverse relationship between the frequency and effect size of causative alleles is an equilibrium between newly arising deleterious mutations and selection eliminating those mutations, resulting in an inverse relation between effect size and average frequency. This assumption is not built into many current models of RALE and, as a result, power calculations may be misleading. We use forward population genetic simulations to explore the ability of GWAS to detect genes in which unconditionally deleterious, partially recessive mutations arise each generation. Our model is based on the standard definition of a gene as a region within which loss-of-function mutations fail to complement, consistent with the multi-allelic basis for Mendelian disorders. Our model predicts that it may not be uncommon for single genes evolving under our model to contribute upwards of 5% to variation in a complex trait, and that such genes could be routinely detected via modified GWAS approaches.
