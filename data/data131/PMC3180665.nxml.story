We present here a rare clinical case of a 53-year-old gentleman with metastasis from renal cell carcinoma (RCC) to the small intestine presenting with extensive polyposis and massive gastrointestinal bleeding which was successfully managed with intraoperative endoscopic polypectomy and segmental small bowel resection. The patient presented with melena 2 weeks after right nephrectomy for RCC. Capsule endoscopy found extensive polyposis throughout the small bowel, and the histological features confirmed the diagnosis of metastatic RCC. The patient eventually underwent laparotomy with intraoperative endoscopy of the entire small bowel. Most of the polyps were removed by snare polypectomy. Three segments of the small bowel with extensive transmural involvement had to be resected with primary anastomosis. In the 2 months following his surgery, the patient had no further evidence of gastrointestinal bleeding. The decision of meticulously removing close to 100 polyps by intraoperative endoscopy prevented the patient from requiring total small bowel resection and lifelong dependence on parenteral nutrition. In conclusion, gastrointestinal bleeding in a patient with known RCC should always trigger full gastrointestinal work-up including capsule endoscopy and, if necessary, double balloon enteroscopy.
