Clotting of blood involves a series of reactions wherein at each step an inactive zymogen is converted to an active enzyme by the product of the previous step, sometimes in plasma and usually on efficient catalytic surfaces provided by the activating platelet. The protein Tissue Factor (TF) initiates this cascade when blood vessels are disrupted, but how this cascade is triggered in the absence of exogenous TF remains the subject of much debate. First, we validated a high throughput experimental system that allowed the noninvasive quantification of thrombin generation dynamics. Next, we showed that “contact activation,” despite use of the best available inhibitor (CTI) to prevent it, builds up enough autocatalytic strength to trigger coagulation without exogenous TF, particularly upon activated platelets. Further, we build an ODE based model to predict the stability of blood resulting from multiple perturbations with active enzymes at various physiologically realizable concentrations. Unlike existing models, we consider the dynamics of platelet activation on reaction rates due to phosphatiylserine exposure. The “Platelet-Plasma” model lays the groundwork for integration of coagulation reaction kinetics and donor specific descriptions of platelet function.
