 rs144848 polymorphism has been associated with several cancers, but results have been inconsistent. In the present study, a meta-analysis was performed to assess the association between the rs144848 polymorphism and cancer risk. Literature was searched from the databases of PubMed, Embase and Google Scholar before April 2016. The fixed or random effects model was used to calculate pooled odd ratios on the basis of heterogeneity. Meta-regression, sensitivity analysis, subgroup analysis and publication bias assessment were also performed using STATA 11.0 software according to Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses 2009. A total of 40 relevant studies from 30 publications including 34,911 cases and 48,329 controls were included in the final meta-analysis. Among them, 22 studies focused on breast cancer, seven on ovarian cancer, five on non-Hodgkin lymphoma, and the remaining six studies examined various other cancers. The meta-analysis results showed that there were significant associations between the rs144848 polymorphism and cancer risk in all genetic models. Stratified by cancer type, the rs144848 polymorphism was associated with non-Hodgkin lymphoma. Stratified by study design, the allele model was associated with breast cancer risk in population-based studies. The meta-analysis suggests that the
