The purpose of this study was to develop and evaluate filmless quality assurance (QA) tools for helical tomotherapy by using the signals from the on‐board megavoltage computed tomography (MVCT) detector and applying a dedicated step‐wedge phantom. The step‐wedge phantom is a 15 cm long step‐like aluminum block positioned on the couch. The phantom was moved through the slit beam and MVCT detector signals were analyzed. Two QA procedures were developed, with gantry fixed at 0°: 1) step‐wedge procedure: to check beam energy consistency, field width, laser alignment with respect to the virtual isocenter, couch movement, and couch velocity; and 2) completion procedure: to check the accuracy of a field abutment made by the tomotherapy system after a treatment interruption. The procedures were designed as constancy tool and were validated by measurement of deliberately induced variations and comparison with a reference method. Two Hi‐Art II machines were monitored over a period of three years using the step‐wedge procedures. The data acquisition takes 5 minutes. The analysis is fully automated and results are available directly after acquisition. Couch speed deviations up to 2% were induced. The mean absolute difference between expected and measured couch speed was 0.2%
