Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are widely accepted as key players in various biological processes. However, the roles of lncRNA in peripheral nerve regeneration remain completely unknown. Thus, in this study, we performed microarray analysis to measure lncRNA expression in the distal segment of the sciatic nerve at 0, 3, 7 and 14 days following injury. We identified 5,354 lncRNAs that were differentially expressed: 3,788 lncRNAs were differentially expressed between days 0 and 3; 3,314 lncRNAs were differentially expressed between days 0 and 7; and 2,400 lncRNAs were differentially expressed between days 0 and 14. The results of RT-qPCR of two dysregulated lncRNAs were consistent with those of microarray analysis. Bioinformatics approaches, including lncRNA classification, gene ontology (GO) analysis and target prediction, were utilized to investigate the functions of these dysregulated lncRNAs in peripheral nerve damage. Importantly, we predicted that several lncRNA-mRNA pairs may participate in biological processes related to peripheral nerve injury. RT-qPCR was performed for the preliminary verification of three lncRNA-mRNA pairs. The overexpression of NONMMUG014387 promoted the proliferation of mouse Schwann cells. Thus, the findings of our study may enhance our knowledge of the role of lncRNAs in nerve injury.
