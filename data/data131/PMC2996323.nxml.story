There are millions of sequences in the human genome that perform essential functions, such as protein-coding exons, noncoding RNAs, and regulatory sequences that control the transcription of genes. However, these functional sequences are embedded in a background of DNA that serves no discernible function. Thus, a major challenge in the field of genomics is the accurate identification of functional sequences in the human genome. One approach to identify functional sequences is to align the genome sequences of many divergent species and search for sequences whose similarity has been maintained during evolution. We have developed GERP++, a software tool that utilizes this “comparative genomics” approach to identify putatively functional sequences. Given a multiple sequence alignment, GERP++ identifies sites under evolutionary constraint, i.e., sites that show fewer substitutions than would be expected to occur during neutral evolution. GERP++ then aggregates these sites into longer, potentially functional sequences called constrained elements. Using GERP++ results in improved resolution of functional sequence elements in the human genome and reveals that a higher proportion of the human genome is under evolutionary constraint (∼7%) than was previously estimated.
