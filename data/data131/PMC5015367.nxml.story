We analyzed cross‐sectional baseline data from the Hemodialysis Fistula Maturation Study, a multicenter prospective observational cohort study of 602 patients with end‐stage renal disease from 7 centers. Brachial artery flow‐ and nitroglycerin‐mediated dilation, carotid‐femoral and ‐radial pulse wave velocity, and venous occlusion plethysmography were performed prior to arteriovenous fistula creation. Relationships of these vascular function measures with demographic, clinical, and laboratory factors were evaluated using linear mixed‐effects models. Arterial function, as assessed by flow‐ and nitroglycerin‐mediated dilation and carotid‐femoral pulse wave velocity, worsened with increasing age and diabetes mellitus. Venous capacitance decreased with diabetes mellitus but not with age. Flow‐mediated dilation was higher among patients undergoing maintenance dialysis than for those at predialysis, and a U‐shaped relationship between serum phosphorus concentration and flow‐mediated dilation was evident. Partial correlations among different measures of vascular function, adjusting for demographic factors, diabetes mellitus, and clinical center, were modest or essentially nonexistent.
