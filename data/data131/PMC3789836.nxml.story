Hereditary nasal parakeratosis (HNPK), an inherited monogenic autosomal recessive skin disorder, leads to crusts and fissures on the nasal planum of Labrador Retrievers. We performed a genome-wide association study (GWAS) and mapped the causative mutation to a small interval on chromosome 2. We re-sequenced the entire genome of one HNPK affected dog and detected three protein-changing mutations in the critical interval. We genotyped these three variants in larger cohorts of dogs and only one showed perfect genotype-phenotype association, prompting us to consider this variant, a missense mutation in SUV39H2, as the most likely causative variant for HNPK. SUV39H2 is an enzyme involved in histone methylation and epigenetic silencing, a process determining the regulation of gene expression during keratinocyte differentiation. A loss of SUV39H2 function is predicted to result in delayed differentiation, which is compatible with the histopathological changes that we observed in biopsies from nasal epidermis of HNPK affected Labrador Retrievers. Thus, our results provide the most likely causative mutation for a hereditary disease in dogs that can now be eradicated by selective breeding. In addition, our results also provide the first hint that SUV39H2, whose
