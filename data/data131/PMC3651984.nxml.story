The effects of statins on insulin resistance and new-onset diabetes are unclear. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effects of rosuvastatin on insulin resistance and adiponectin in patients with mild to moderate hypertension. In a randomized, prospective, single-blind study, 53 hypertensive patients were randomly assigned to the control group (n=26) or the rosuvastatin (20 mg once daily) group (n=27) during an 8-week treatment period. Both groups showed significant improvements in systolic blood pressure and flow-mediated dilation (FMD) after 8 weeks of treatment. Rosuvastatin treatment improved total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein (LDL)-cholesterol, and triglyceride levels. The control and rosuvastatin treatment groups did not differ significantly in the change in HbA1c (3.0±10.1% vs. -1.3±12.7%; p=0.33), fasting glucose (-1.3±18.0% vs. 2.5±24.1%; p=0.69), or fasting insulin levels (5.2±70.5% vs. 22.6±133.2%; p=0.27) from baseline. Furthermore, the control and rosuvastatin treatment groups did not differ significantly in the change in the QUICKI insulin sensitivity index (mean change, 2.2±11.6% vs. 3.6±11.9%; p=0.64) or the HOMA index (11.6±94.9% vs. 32.4±176.7%; p=0.44). The plasma adiponectin level increased significantly in the rosuvastatin treatment group (p=0.046), but did not differ significantly from that in the control group (mean change, 23.2±28.4% vs. 23.1±27.6%; p=0.36). Eight weeks of rosuvastatin (20 mg) therapy resulted in no significant improvement or deterioration in fasting glucose levels, insulin resistance, or adiponectin levels in patients with mild to moderate hypertension.
