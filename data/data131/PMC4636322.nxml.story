Synaptic connectivity between neurons in the brain and the efficacies (“weights”) of these synaptic connections are thought to encode the long-term memory of an organism. But a closer look at their molecular implementation, as well as imaging experiments over longer periods of time, have shown that synaptic connections are subject to numerous stochastic processes. We propose that this seeming unreliability of synaptic connections is not a bug, but an important feature. It endows networks of neurons with an important experimentally observed but theoretically not understood capability: Automatic compensation for internal and external changes. This perspective of network plasticity requires a new conceptual and mathematical framework, which is provided by this article. Stochasticity of synapses is seen here not as noise of an inherently deterministic system, but as an inherent property, similarly as Brownian motion of particles in a physical system cannot be abstracted away if one wants to understand certain properties of a physical system. In fact, we find that this underlying stochasticity of synaptic connections enables a network of neurons to continuously try out new network configurations while maintaining its functionality.
