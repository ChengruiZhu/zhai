Paclitaxel chemoresistance restricts the therapeutic efficacy and prognosis of patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC). Accumulating evidence suggests that aberrant expression of long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) contributes to cancer progression. Therefore, we aimed to identify lncRNAs associated with paclitaxel resistance in NPC. First, paclitaxel-resistant CNE-2 cells (CNE-2-Pr) were successfully established and confirmed to be 33.26Â±8.70 times more resistant than parental CNE-2 cells. Then, differential expression profile of lncRNAs associated with NPC paclitaxel resistance, which contained a total of 2,670 known lncRNAs and 4,820 novel lncRNAs, was constructed via next generation sequencing technology. Our qRT-PCR confirmed that 7 of the top 8 lncRNAs were expressed with the same trend as the prediction, including 4 known lncRNAs (n375709, n377806, n369241 and n335785) and 3 novel lncRNAs (Unigene6646, Unigene6644 and Unigene1654). Our group initially focused on lncRNA n375709, which was the most significantly overexpressed lncRNA of the known lncRNAs. CCK-8 assays demonstrated that further inhibition of lncRNA n375709 increased the paclitaxel sensitivity in NPC 5-8F and 6-10B cells. In conclusion, the present study provided an overview of the expression profiles of lncRNAs correlated with paclitaxel resistance. lncRNA n375709 was identified to be involved in the regulation of NPC paclitaxel resistance.
