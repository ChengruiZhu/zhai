Tissue factor (TF) is a cell surface receptor for coagulation factor VII (fVII). The TF-activated fVII (fVIIa) complex is an essential initiator of the extrinsic blood coagulation process. Interactions between cancer cells and immune cells via coagulation factors and adhesion molecules can promote progression of cancer, including epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC). This process is not necessarily advantageous, as tumor tissues generally undergo hypoxia due to aberrant vasculature, followed by reduced access to plasma components such as coagulation factors. However, hypoxia can activate TF expression. Expression of fVII, intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1), and multiple pro-inflammatory cytokines can be synergistically induced in EOC cells in response to hypoxia along with serum deprivation. Thus, pro-inflammatory responses associated with the TF-fVIIaâ€“ICAM-1 interaction are expected within hypoxic tissues. Tumor tissue consists of multiple components such as stromal cells, interstitial fluid, albumin, and other micro-factors such as proton and metal ions. These factors, together with metabolism reprogramming in response to hypoxia and followed by functional modification of TF, may contribute to coagulation factor-driven inflammatory responses in EOC tissues. The aim of this review was to describe potential coagulation factor-driven inflammatory responses in hypoxic EOC tissues. Arguments were extended to clinical issues targeting this characteristic tumor environment.
