Leaf-cutter ants form massive subterranean colonies containing millions of workers that harvest hundreds of kilograms of leaves each year. They use these leaves to grow a mutualistic fungus that serves as the colony's primary food source. By farming fungus in specialized garden chambers, these dominant Neotropical herbivores facilitate rapid large-scale plant biomass conversion. Our understanding of this degradation process, and the responsible microbial community, is limited. In this study, we track the degradation of plant polymers in leaf-cutter ant fungus gardens and characterize the microbial community potentially mediating this process. We show that cellulose and hemicelluloses are degraded in the fungus gardens and that a previously unknown microbial community containing a diversity of bacteria is present. Metagenomic analysis of this community's genetic content revealed many genes predicted to encode enzymes capable of degrading plant cell walls. The ability of leaf-cutter ants to maintain an external microbial community with high plant biomass-degrading capacity likely represents a key step in the establishment of these ants as widespread, dominant insect herbivores in the Neotropics. This system is an important model for understanding how microbial communities degrade plant biomass in natural systems and has direct relevancy for bioenergy, given recent interest in cellulosic biofuels.
