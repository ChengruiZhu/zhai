Alpha‐1‐antitrypsin deficiency (AATD) is an inherited disease characterized by emphysema and liver disease. AATD is most often caused by a single amino acid substitution at amino acid 342 in the mature protein, resulting in the Z mutation of the alpha‐1‐antitrypsin gene (ZAAT). This substitution is associated with misfolding and accumulation of ZAAT in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) of hepatocytes and monocytes, causing a toxic gain of function. Retained ZAAT is eliminated by ER‐associated degradation and autophagy. We hypothesized that alpha‐1‐antitrypsin (AAT)‐interacting proteins play critical roles in quality control of human AAT. Using co‐immunoprecipitation, we identified ERdj3, an ER‐resident Hsp40 family member, as a part of the AAT trafficking network. Depleting ERdj3 increased the rate of ZAAT degradation in hepatocytes by redirecting ZAAT to the ER calreticulin‐EDEM1 pathway, followed by autophagosome formation. In the Huh7.5 cell line, ZAAT ER clearance resulted from enhancing ERdj3‐mediated ZAAT degradation by silencing ERdj3 while simultaneously enhancing autophagy. In this context, ERdj3 suppression may eliminate the toxic gain of function associated with polymerization of ZAAT, thus providing a potential new therapeutic approach to the treatment of AATD‐related liver disease.
