The Src protein kinases are integral members of numerous signaling pathways involved in cellular growth and differentiation. The master regulator of the Src family is the protein kinase Csk, which adds a phosphate to the C-terminal tail, inhibiting Src Kinase function. Proper regulation of these signaling pathways by Csk is essential as unregulated activity in these pathways is correlated with the development of various cancers and autoimmune diseases. Understanding the nature of the mechanism and structure of Csk may lead to therapeutics and a better understanding of Src signaling pathways. Conformational changes associated with nucleotide binding and release have been shown to regulate the efficiency of Src down-regulation by Csk. To obtain insights into the nature of these nucleotide-induced structural changes, we examined the conformation of Csk in solution while bound to the ATP analog AMP-PNP and product ADP using a combination of small angle x-ray scattering and molecular dynamics. Surprisingly, both nucleotides induce extended conformations of Csk compared to the apo-enzyme, suggesting a novel mode of function. Further understanding of this mode of function may aid in the design of cancer therapeutics that act by regulating Src signaling pathways by modulating the function of Csk.
