Modern strategies in adipose tissue engineering (ATE) take advantage of the easy harvest, abundance and differentiation potential towards mesenchymal lineages of hADSCs. The controlled conversion of hADSCs to committed adipogenic precursors and further mature adipocytes formation is important for good long-term results in soft tissue regeneration. Thus, in this study, we report: (i) the isolation of the processed lipoaspirate (PLA) cells from adipose tissue and sanguine fractions; (ii) the phenotypic characterization of the PLA descendants; (iii) the design of a novel protocol for the modulation of adipogenic conditions in the perspectives of ATE applications. To modulate the differentiation rate through our protocol, we propose to selectively modify the formulation of the adipogenic media in accordance with the evolution of the process. Therefore, we aimed to ensure the long-term proliferation of the precursor cells and to delay the late adipogenic events. The status of differentiation was characterized in terms of intracellular lipid accumulation and reorganization of the cytoskeleton simultaneously with perilipin protein expression. Moreover, we studied the sequential activation of
