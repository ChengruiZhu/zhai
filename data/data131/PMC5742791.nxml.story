Behavioural problems, such as injurious pecking, are major welfare concerns in laying hen husbandry. To take adequate measures at the right time, useful information about the occurrence of these problems in a flock can be obtained by examining the hens for feather loss and skin injuries. Although feather loss and injuries can also result from mechanical abrasion or health issues, they provide strong evidence of behavioural problems in a flock, particularly when observed on the back and the tail of the animals. In our study, the behaviour of two genetic strains of laying hens (conventional layers and dual-purpose breeds) was evaluated by means of two different methods for assessing the feathers and the skin on distinct body parts of the animals. One method was a mere visual inspection of the flocks, whereas the other included the capture and handling of individual hens. Damaging behaviour, which resulted in severe feather loss and skin injuries, only occurred in the conventional layers. Both of the methods provided similar results for feather loss and injuries for most of the tested body regions and weeks. Therefore, the mere visual method was sufficient to detect injurious behaviour in laying hens.
