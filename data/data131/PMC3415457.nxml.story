When a cell divides, each daughter cell receives one, and only one, of each sister DNA molecule from the mother. These identical DNA molecules, called chromatids, result from the replication of a single DNA molecule and are held together by a ring-shaped protein complex termed cohesin. As a cellâ€™s genetic information is divided into several distinct chromosomes, this arrangement, termed sister chromatid cohesion, makes it possible to distinguish sister and non-sister chromatids and is a prerequisite for the faithful division of genetic information. Cohesin rings, consisting of three subunits, trap two sister DNA molecules inside them. Additional proteins are required to load the rings onto DNA and to ensure that they capture both sister DNA molecules. We have investigated the roles of Scc3 and Pds5, two proteins that associate with cohesin rings, and were previously proposed to keep them stably locked once loaded onto DNA. Surprisingly, when we depleted Scc3 and Pds5 from yeast, the rings remained stably associated with the DNA; however, cohesion between the sisters was severely compromised. We conclude that Scc3 and Pds5 function to capture the two sister DNA molecules together inside the cohesin ring.
