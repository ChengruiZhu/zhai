A total of 12 subjects met the inclusion criteria and had a questionnaire completed at time of injury and fluid samples obtained at the time of ACL reconstruction surgery. The average time from injury to the time of surgery was 30.7±15.5 days. The mean serum C2C concentration at the time of surgery was 1.12 ±0.20 ng/ml and the mean urine C2C concentration was 2.12±0.51 ng/ml. The mean WOMAC Pain score was 72±21 points. The WOMAC Pain scores at the time of initial injury were inversely correlated (r=-0.609 , p=0.036) with serum C2C concentrations at the time of surgery approximately 4 weeks later. WOMAC Pain scores at the time of ACL injury accounted for 37% of the variability in serum C2C concentrations at the time of ACL reconstruction (Figure 1A). Similar results were observed for the correlation between WOMAC Pain scores at the time of injury and urine C2C concentrations at the time of surgery. The WOMAC Pain scores at the time of initial injury were also inversely correlated (r=-0.759, p=0.004) with urine C2C concentrations at the time of surgery. WOMAC Pain scores at the time of ACL injury accounted for 58% of the variability in urine C2C concentrations at the time of surgery.
