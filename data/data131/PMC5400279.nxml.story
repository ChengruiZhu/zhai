Many infectious disease interventions, including water treatment, hand hygiene, and surface decontamination, target pathogens in the environment. Explicitly modeling the concentration of pathogens in the environment within transmission models can be a useful way to consider not only the impact of such mitigation efforts but also the spatial spread of pathogens and sampling strategies for environmental monitoring. However, we need to understand the dose–response relationship, that is, how exposure to pathogens translates into a probability of infection. The field of quantitative microbial risk assessment has developed dose–response models from experimental data, but little work has been done to assess the impact the choice of dose–response model has on transmission model dynamics. We show that dynamics of simulated transmission models incorporating a dose–response model that has been fit to experimental data can vary widely despite little statistical difference in the fit to the experimental dose–response data. This and other results allow us to give specific guidance for the use of dose–response functions in a transmission modeling context. We also underscore the usefulness of environmentally mediated transmission models by demonstrating how environmental monitoring data can be used to provide new information about pathogen strain.
