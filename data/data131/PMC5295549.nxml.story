Aneurysmal dilatation of segment of the left ventricle in the absence of coronary disease has been reported and termed diverticulum, which appears to be a congenital anomaly. A 56-year-old white female was admitted to our hospital with chest pain that has been intermittent over the past 1 month. The pain was described as exertional, substernal and pressure-like in quality, radiating to left arm and jaw, and lasting approximately 30 minutes each episode; it was associated with shortness of breath. She has had approximately 10 such episodes in the past 1 month. The patient denied any dizziness, palpitations, syncope, orthopnea or paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea (PND). She has had a history of hypertension for many years, however has not been compliant with her medications for the past 6 months. On admission, vital signs revealed blood pressure of 185/100 mm Hg, and regular heart rate of 94 beats per minute. Physical examination revealed a normal body habitus. Cardiac examination revealed no murmurs or extra cardiac sounds on auscultation. The pulmonary and abdomen examinations were unremarkable. The chest radiograph was normal. The electrocardiogram showed sinus rhythm, with borderline prolongation of the QT interval. The laboratory test results, including cardiac enzymes, were normal. Transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) revealed normal left ventricular systolic function, with localized dyskinesis of the apex. No significant valvular abnormalities were identified. Coronary angiography revealed angiographically normal coronary arteries; left ventriculography showed abnormal apical “filling defect” consistent with an aneurysm. A repeat echocardiogram using Definity contrast revealed left ventricular apical diverticulum with hypertrabeculation. The patient was placed on antihypertensive medications with resolution of her chest pain, and was able to ambulate comfortably. The patient was counseled thoroughly on the importance of compliance with her medications. This case describes an apical left ventricular diverticulum found incidentally and demonstrated on contrast echocardiography in a patient with chest pain.
