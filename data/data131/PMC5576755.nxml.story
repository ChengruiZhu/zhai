Complex dynamics of microbial communities underlie their essential roles in health and disease. To maintain or restore healthy states, we must better understand the nature and basis of stability in the gut microbiota, under normal and perturbed conditions. Stability, resilience, and response to perturbation are central topics in community ecology. Extreme perturbations such as near-complete loss of biomass from a system can reveal factors that influence community structure. Recognizing the return to baseline diversity and abundances of biomarkers in community-wide recovery after a disturbance enables us to understand the basic pillars of resilience that contribute to human health. We have designed a densely sampled longitudinal experiment in human volunteers using transient non-inflammatory diarrhea as the perturbation. In order to uncover the essential players in the recovery process, we have tailored new advances in ribosomal sequence variant detection and sparse multidomain analytics that incorporate phylogenetic structure. We show sparse meaningful multidimensional projections that exhibit the essential features in resilient recovery. This work shows how a carefully designed longitudinal study combining denoised ribosomal RNA sequence variants and metagenomic data can inform the taxa and processes involved in the recovery from loss of large proportions of intestinal biomass.
