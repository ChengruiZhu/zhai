A psychoticism questionnaire in Hindi consisting of 60 items was standardised by administering it to 100 psychotics (schizophrenics and manic-depressives), 100 neurotics, 100 psychiatrically normal relatives of psychotics and 100 normals. The mean psychoticism score (P-score) of psychotics, neurotics, relatives and normals were 30.69, 13.63, 13.85 and 8.83 respectively, were significantly different from one another except for the difference between neurotics and relatives. The scores in each diagnostic group were normally distributed. Reliability as measured by Kuder-Richardson formula, split half, and test-retest methods gave coefficients between .62 and .88. Criterion validity as measured by comparing the diagnostic groups according to proportion of subjects in top, middle and bottom thirds; concurrent validity as assessed by correlating the P-score with scores obtained on PEN scale and on Paranoid and Depression sub-scales of Personality Traits Inventory nad cross-validity studied by comparing our scores on psychotics with those obtained at three other centres in India were satisfactory. The questionnaire could well discriminate between psychotics and non-psychotics, and a satisfactory cut-off point has been suggested for this.
