The recent development of Sequence Capture methodology represents a powerful strategy for enhancing data generation to assess genetic variation of targeted genomic regions. Here, we present SUPER-CAP, a bioinformatics web tool aimed at handling Sequence Capture data, fine calculating the allele frequency of variations and building genotype-specific sequence of captured genes. The dataset used to develop this in silico strategy consists of 378 loci and related regulative regions in a collection of 44 tomato landraces. About 14,000 high-quality variants were identified. The high depth (>40Ã—) of coverage and adopting the correct filtering criteria allowed identification of about 4,000 rare variants and 10 genes with a different copy number variation. We also show that the tool is capable to reconstruct genotype-specific sequences for each genotype by using the detected variants. This allows evaluating the combined effect of multiple variants in the same protein. The architecture and functionality of SUPER-CAP makes the software appropriate for a broad set of analyses including SNP discovery and mining. Its functionality, together with the capability to process large data sets and efficient detection of sequence variation, makes SUPER-CAP a valuable bioinformatics tool for genomics and breeding purposes.
