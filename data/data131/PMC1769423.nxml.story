The transient opening of the DNA double helix is a fundamental step in several DNA metabolic processes. This reaction is driven by proteins called helicases, which make use of ATP as fuel to unwind the DNA duplex. The RecQ family of helicases help maintain genome stability. Recent studies have shown that RecQ helicases, in addition to promoting DNA unwinding, can also catalyze the opposite reactionâ€”the pairing of the partially unwound DNA duplexes. The mechanisms underlying the regulation of this dual enzymatic activity are, however, unknown. Here we describe two structural forms of the human RECQ1 helicase, a large oligomeric complex composed of five or six subunits, and a smaller form consistent with only one or two molecules. We provide an initial view of the three-dimensional structure of the larger complex and show that this state is associated with DNA strand annealing, whereas the smaller form carries out DNA unwinding. The functional switch from strand-annealing to DNA unwinding is controlled by ATP binding, which promotes the dissociation of the larger, higher-order complexes. By providing insight into the mechanisms regulating RecQ helicase activity, our study opens a new window onto a fundamental aspect of DNA metabolism.
