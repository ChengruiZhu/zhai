Digitalization of health and disability information system is an emerging need around the world. The transition from an analogue (and usually unsystematic information compilations) to digital health information system is a common observed trend which is expected to gain dominance in forthcoming decades. The information communication technology (ICT) developments have created multiple work streams to this field which are usually summarized as e-health. Further to the digital technology, the need to define and provide the content standards is a shared responsibility of the both content and technology stakeholders: one needs to define the content in a analogue form first, then convert into a digital application. Each health information rubric should be operationally defined and then be digitally represented in computerized information systems. To achieve this aim ontology as a computer science provides the scientific discipline and practical tools to define entities with their attributes and values. Creating the ontological basis for classifications will enable to represent the underpinning knowledge structure in an operational way; describe the logical rules as to how they relate to each other, identify measurable properties and provide a basis to share information both digitally and among humans irrespective of linguistic differences. In this way, health and disability information can be harmonized and aggregated at both individual and population levels.
