Gastric cancer (GC) is the third leading cause of cancer death due to its poor prognosis and limited treatment options. Evidence indicates that pseudogene-derived long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) may be important players in human cancer progression, including GC. In this paper, we report that a newly discovered pseudogene-derived lncRNA named DUXAP8, a 2107-bp RNA, was remarkably upregulated in GC. Additionally, a higher level of DUXAP8 expression in GC was significantly associated with greater tumor size, advanced clinical stage, and lymphatic metastasis. Patients with a higher level of DUXAP8 expression had a relatively poor prognosis. Further experiments revealed that knockdown of DUXAP8 significantly inhibited cell proliferation and migration, as documented in the SGC7901 and BGC823 cell lines. Furthermore, RNA immunoprecipitation and chromatin immunoprecipitation assays demonstrated that DUXAP8 could epigenetically suppress the expression of PLEKHO1 by binding to EZH2 and SUZ12 (two key components of PRC2), thus promoting GC development. Taken together, our findings suggest that the pseudogene-derived lncRNA DUXAP8 promotes the progression of GC and is a potential therapeutic target for GC intervention.
