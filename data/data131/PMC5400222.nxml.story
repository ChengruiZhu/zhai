A series of 100 consecutive patients with irreparable rotator cuff tears that had failed conservative treatment underwent arthroscopic SCR using fascia lata autografts; 7 patients with deltoid weakness due to cervical or axillary nerve palsy and 3 patients with severe shoulder stiffness (passive shoulder elevation, less than 90°) before surgery were excluded from the study population. The remaining 90 patients were allocated into 3 groups according to their preoperative active shoulder elevation: (1) no pseudoparalysis: more than 90° of active shoulder elevation (48 patients; mean age, 66.3 years; mean tear size in anterioposterior direction, 3.5 cm); (2) moderate pseudoparalysis: no shoulder stiffness, less than 90° of active shoulder elevation, patients maintained more than 90° elevation once the shoulder was elevated passively (27 patients; mean age, 68.1 years, mean tear size, 3.5 cm); and (3) severe pseudoparalysis: no shoulder stiffness, less than 90° of active shoulder elevation, patients had a positive drop-arm sign (15 patients; mean age, 62.3 years, mean tear size, 4.9 cm). Physical examination, radiography, and magnetic resonance imaging were performed before surgery; at 3, 6, and 12 months after surgery; and yearly thereafter. The American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons (ASES) score, active shoulder range of motion, acromiohumeral distance, and healing rate were compared between patients with and without pseudoparalysis as well as between before surgery and at the final follow-up (mean, 48 months; range, 24 to 88 months) by using the
