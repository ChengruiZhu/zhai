Non invasive methods to assess arterial function are widely used in adults. The development and progression of arterial vascular disease is a multifactorial process that can start early in life, thus even in a pediatric population. Risk factors for cardiovascular disease mediate their effects by altering the structure, properties and function of wall and endothelial components of the arterial blood vessels. The ability to detect and monitor sub-clinical damage, representing the cumulative and integrated influence of risk factors in impairing arterial wall integrity, holds potential to further refine cardiovascular risk stratification and enable early intervention to prevent or attenuate disease progression. Measurements that provide more direct information in relation to changes in arterial wall integrity clearly hold predictive and therapeutic potential. The aim of this current review will be to describe the non-invasive procedure used in children to investigate the mechanical properties of a great elastic artery, the common carotid, and the endothelial function of the brachial artery. The accuracy of recording noninvasively the blood pressure wave contour along the arterial tree has been improved by the technique of applanation tonometry. The results obtained with these methods in previous studies are described.
