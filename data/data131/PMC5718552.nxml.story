Current commercially available planning systems with Monte Carlo (MC)‐based final dose calculation in IMRT planning employ pencil‐beam (PB) algorithms in the optimization process. Consequently, dose coverage for SBRT lung plans can feature cold‐spots at the interface between lung and tumor tissue. For lung wall (LW)‐seated tumors, there can also be hot spots within nearby normal organs (example: ribs). This study evaluated two different practical approaches to limiting cold spots within the target and reducing high doses to surrounding normal organs in MC‐based IMRT planning of LW‐seated tumors. First, “iterative reoptimization”, where the MC calculation (with PB‐based optimization) is initially performed. The resultant cold spot is then contoured and used as a simultaneous boost volume. The MC‐based dose is then recomputed. The second technique uses noncoplanar beam angles with limited path through lung tissue. Both techniques were evaluated against a conventional coplanar beam approach with a single MC calculation. In all techniques the prescription dose was normalized to cover 95% of the PTV. Fifteen SBRT lung cases with LW‐seated tumors were planned. The results from iterative reoptimization showed that conformity index (CI) and/or PTV dose uniformity (
