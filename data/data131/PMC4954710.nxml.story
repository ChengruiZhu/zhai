Laboratory experiments using human participants have shown that, in groups or contact networks, humans often behave as conditional cooperator or its moody variant. Although conditional cooperation in dyadic interaction is well understood, mechanisms underlying these behaviors in group or networks beyond a pair of individuals largely remain unclear. In this study, we show that players adopting a type of reinforcement learning exhibit these conditional cooperation behaviors. The results are general in the sense that the model explains experimental results to date obtained in various situations. It explains moody conditional cooperation, which is a recently discovered behavioral trait of humans, in addition to traditional conditional cooperation. It also explains experimental results obtained with both the prisonerâ€™s dilemma and public goods games and with different population structure. Crucially, our model assumes that individuals do not have access to information about what other individuals are doing such that they cannot explicitly condition their behavior on how many others have previously cooperated. Thus, our results provide a proximate and unified understanding of these experimentally observed patterns.
