Cells can differentiate by segregating molecules that direct expression of specific sets of genes to one of the two cells produced by division. This generally occurs by direct mechanical movement or asymmetric anchoring of these molecules, which act after division to influence gene expression. In this study, we define a different mechanism by which the budding yeast transcription regulator Ace2 is asymmetrically partitioned. We show that Ace2 moves from uniform distribution to strong accumulation in the daughter nucleus while mother and daughter cells are still connected, and that the enzyme Cbk1 directly controls this segregation by attaching phosphate to specific sites on Ace2. We also demonstrate that Cbk1 is restricted to the daughter cell. Using both biochemical and live-cell experiments, we show that the Cbk1-mediated modifications activate Ace2 and block its interaction with nuclear export machinery, trapping it in the daughter cell nucleus. In addition to demonstrating Cbk1â€²s remarkable biochemical similarity to related enzymes in multicellular organisms, our analysis shows that a uniformly distributed regulator of gene expression can be made asymmetrically active in connected cells through the direct action of a localized modifying enzyme.
