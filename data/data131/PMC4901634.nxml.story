25 patients were identified as having acute Type V dislocations. Acute surgical AC reconstruction was selected in 8 patients and initial conservative therapy 17. In the conservative group: 8 patients (57%) returned to duty without surgery (average 90.3 days); 4 patients had delayed surgery and returned to full duty (average 238.75 days from initial injury); 2 refused surgery and changed careers; and 3 patients were lost to follow up. In the acute surgical group: 6 patients (75%) returned to full duty in an average of 207 days with 3 of those requiring revision surgery; 1 patient was lost to follow up, and 1 patient failed to return to full duty. There was no significant difference in time to return to duty between the acute surgical group and those who underwent delayed surgical reconstruction (p=0.62). In the conservatively treated group, patients who failed conservative treatment and elected for surgery had a mean increase in CC distance of 144% (range 118%-166%) with a mean 22.5mm displacement of the clavicle above the acromion (19.3- 25.1 mm). In conservative group that did not undergo surgery there was an average 141% increase in CC distance (range 102% - 217%) with a mean 17.3mm displacement (12.5-24.22 mm). There was a significant difference in mm of displacement of the clavicle above the acromion in conservatively treated patients who underwent surgical correction and those who did not (p=.035) while there was no significant difference between the CC distance in this same group (p=0.9).
