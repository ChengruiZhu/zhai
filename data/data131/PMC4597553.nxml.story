Intraoperative ACL graft force measurements demonstrated two distinct ACL graft curves (high-tension versus isometric ACL graft) were achieved with the two different femoral graft tunnel locations. At 90 degrees of knee flexion, there is a 1.6 fold increase in ACL graft force between a high-tension ACL graft and isometric ACL graft at the time of surgery. High ACL graft force with joint motion appeared to be deleterious to early ACL graft-tunnel incorporation. The load to failure for knees with high-tension ACL grafts (5.50 ± 2.30N) was significantly lower when compared to immobilized (10.90 ± 2.78N, p<0.01) and isometric grafts (9.91 ± 3.36N, p=0.01) at 3 weeks. At 6 weeks, isometric ACL grafts coupled with daily knee motion had greater load to failure than immobilized knees (24.16 ± 5.72N versus 16.56 ± 3.51N, p=0.01). Immobilized and isometric grafts had greater femoral bone volume fraction than knees with high-tension grafts at both 3 and 6 weeks (p<0.01 and p<0.001, respectively). Greater cellularity and collagen gaping were seen in loaded ACL graft (those that underwent motion) versus immobilized grafts, particularly within the tibial tunnel. Higher prevalence of osteoclasts were seen along the graft-tunnel interface in high-tension ACL grafts.
