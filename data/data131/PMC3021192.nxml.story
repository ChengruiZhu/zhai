The objective of this review is to discuss emerging concepts in pelvic organ prolapse, in particular, “What is cure?” In a post-trial data analysis of the CARE (Colpopexy and Urinary Reduction Efforts) trial, treatment success varied tremendously depending on the definition used (19.2%–97.2%). Definitions that included the absence of vaginal bulge symptoms had the strongest relationships with the patients’ assessment of overall improvement and treatment success. As demonstrated by this study, there are several challenges in defining cure in prolapse surgery. Additionally, the symptoms of prolapse are variable. The degree of prolapse does not correlate directly with symptoms. There are many surgical approaches to pelvic organ prolapse. Multiple ways to quantify prolapse are used. There is a lack of standardized definition of cure. The data on prolapse surgery outcomes are heterogeneous. The goal of surgical repair is to return the pelvic organs to their original anatomic positions. Ideally, we have four main goals: no anatomic prolapse, no functional symptoms, patient satisfaction, and the avoidance of complications. The impact of transvaginal mesh requires thoughtful investigation. The driving force should be patient symptoms in defining cure of prolapse.
