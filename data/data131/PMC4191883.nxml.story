Bacterial leucine transporter (LeuT) belongs to neurotransmitter:sodium symporter (NSS) family. Its human orthologs include dopamine transporter and serotonin transporter. Malfunction of NSS members has been implicated in neurological diseases, hence the significance of elucidating their mechanism of function as clinically relevant drug targets. NSSs co-transport substrates (neurotransmitters or amino acids) and sodium ions across the cell membrane via alternating access to extracellular and intracellular media, which enables the uptake of substrate and ions from the extracellular region and their release to the intracellular region. Despite significant progress in elucidating the structure and function of NSS family members, their mechanism of function and the role of their N-terminal segment exposed to the cell interior remain elusive. Here, we provide for the first time a full-atomic time-resolved description of the complete transport cycle of LeuT using multiscale simulations. Two major findings are (i) elucidation of the structure and dynamics of the N-terminal segment which helps in mediating substrate and cation release and resuming the transport cycle, and (ii) determination of the structures of two minimally hydrated intermediates occluded to both extracellular and intracellular environments.
