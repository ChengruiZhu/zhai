To model accurate protein networks we need to extend our knowledge of protein associations in molecular systems much further. Biologists believe that high-throughput experiments will fill the gaps in our knowledge. However, if these approaches perform biased screenings, leaving important areas poorly characterized, success in modelling protein networks will require additional approaches to explore these ‘dark’ areas. We assess the value of integrating bio-computational approaches to build accurate and comprehensive network models for human and yeast proteomes and compare these models with models derived by combining multiple experimental datasets. We show that the predicted networks resemble the topological and error features of the experimental networks, and contain information on true protein associations within and beyond their constitutive first order binary predictions. We suggest that the majority of predicted network space is dark matter containing important functional areas, elusive to current experimental designs. Until novel experimental designs emerge as effective tools to screen these hidden regions, computational predictions will be a valuable approach for exploring them.
