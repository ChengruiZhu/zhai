Cellular iron homeostasis is maintained by a sophisticated system that responds to iron levels and coordinates the expression of targets important for balancing iron export and uptake with intracellular storage and utilization. Ferroportin is the only known cellular iron exporter in mammalian cells and plays a critical role in both cellular and systemic iron balance. Thus the ability to regulate cellular iron export is of great interest in the search for therapeutic strategies to control dysregulated iron homeostasis, iron overload disorders, and conditions affected by cellular iron concentrations such as antimicrobial resistance. During iron deprivation, repression of ferroportin levels reduces iron export and preserves cellular iron. Ferroportin translation is known to be repressed by iron regulatory proteins that bind to the 5′UTR, yet alternative mechanisms that can post-transcriptionally regulate ferroportin have not been previously reported. Here, we find that miR-485-3p is induced during iron deficiency and represses ferroportin by directly targeting its 3′UTR, and further experimental evidence supports a model that includes both iron regulatory proteins and microRNAs as post-transcriptional regulators of ferroportin. These findings demonstrate a novel role for microRNAs in the cellular response to iron deficiency and can have therapeutic implications for various diseases of iron homeostasis.
