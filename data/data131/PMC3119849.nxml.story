PADI4 post-translationally converts peptidylarginine to citrulline. PADI4 can disrupt the apoptotic process via the citrullination of histone H3 in the promoter of p53-target genes. The current study focused on PADI4 expression in various subtypes of oesophageal carcinoma (EC) by immunohistochemistry, western blotting and real time PCR. The study also investigated the effect of bile acid deoxycholate (DCA) on PADI4 expression in Eca-109 cells that originated from EC. Apoptosis and DCA-induced toxicity were analyzed by TUNEL, MTT assay and flow cytometry. Additionally, the present study investigated the correlation between single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in PADI4 gene and EC risk in Chinese population using Illumina GoldenGate assay. Compared with paraneoplastic tissues, the transcriptional and translational levels of PADI4 were significantly elevated in oesophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC, n=9) and oesophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC, n=5) tissues. Immunolabeling detected expression of PADI4 in ESCC tissues (98.56%, n=139), EAC samples (87.5%, n=16) and oesophageal small cell undifferentiated carcinoma (91.7%, n=12) but not in normal tissues (0%, n=16). Furthermore, PADI4 levels is positively correlated with the pathological classification of ESCC (p=0.009). PADI4 expression levels were consistent with the number of apoptotic cells in the induced Eca-109 cells. rs10437048 [OR= 0.012831; 95% CI, 0.001746~0.094278; p=1.556Ã—10
