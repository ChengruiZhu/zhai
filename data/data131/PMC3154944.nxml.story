We describe the first atomic-detail models and simulations of a full-length, membrane-bound mammalian cytochrome P450. To date, all the structural studies of microsomal, drug-metabolizing cytochrome P450s have been performed using engineered, solubilized forms of the enzymes and it is not yet understood how the membrane influences their structure, dynamics, and ability to bind substrates. We focused on CYP2C9, the second most abundant cytochrome P450 in the human liver which oxidizes 20% of all marketed drugs. Here, we have derived models of CYP2C9-membrane complexes with a modeling procedure based on molecular dynamics simulations started with arbitrary configurations of the protein in the membrane and performed using both coarse grained and atomic-detail molecular representations. This procedure is expected to be generally applicable to proteins that are anchored in the membrane with a single transmembrane helix. The models and simulations provide evidence for selective substrate access and product release routes in membrane-bound CYPs. This observation may contribute to new strategies to manipulate the activity of CYPs and other enzymes with buried active sites. We anticipate that this study will bring about a paradigm shift towards studying microsomal CYPs as dynamic structures in their natural, lipid environment rather than in artificially solubilized forms.
