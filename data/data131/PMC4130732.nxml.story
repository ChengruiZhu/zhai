Cytotoxic chemotherapeutic drugs, especially when used in combination, are widely employed to treat a variety of cancers in patients but often lead to serious symptoms that negatively affect physical functioning and quality of life. There is compelling evidence that implicates cytotoxic chemotherapy-induced inflammation in the etiology of these symptoms. Because IL-1β plays a central role as an initiator cytokine in immune responses, we compared doxorubicin, a drug known to induce IL-1β production, with ten other commonly prescribed chemotherapeutic drugs in their ability to lead to processing and secretion of IL-1β by primary mouse macrophages. Seven of them (melphalan, cisplatin, vincristine, etoposide, paclitaxel, methotrexate, and cytarabine) caused the production of IL-1β in cells pretreated with lipopolysaccharide. When delivered in combination with doxorubicin, one of the drugs, vincristine, was also capable of synergistically activating the NLRP3-dependent inflammasome and increasing expression of IL-1β, IL-6, and CXCL1. The absence of TNF-α and IL-1 signaling caused a partial reduction in the production of mature IL-1β. Three small-molecule inhibitors known to suppress activity of kinases situated upstream of mitogen-activated kinases (MAPKs) inhibited the expression of IL-1β, IL-6, and CXCL1 when doxorubicin and vincristine were used singly or together, so specific kinase inhibitors may be useful in reducing inflammation in patients receiving chemotherapy.
