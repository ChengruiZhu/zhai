Synaptic scaling is a form of homeostatic plasticity that normalizes the strength of synapses (the structure that allows nerve cells to communicate) and is triggered by chronic inhibition of neuronal activity. Although extensive studies have been conducted, the molecular mechanism of this synaptic adaptation is not understood. Using cultured cortical neurons, we show that chronic inhibition of neuronal activity reduces calcium influx into neurons, which, in turn, decreases the activity of the calcium-dependent phosphatase calcineurin. These changes lead to an increase in GluA1-containing, calcium-permeable AMPA receptors, which mediate communication at the synapse. Newly inserted calcium-permeable AMPA receptors restore calcium currents, which enhance synaptic strength and recover calcium signaling. We also show that inhibition or activation of calcineurin activity is sufficient to induce or block synaptic scaling, respectively, suggesting that calcineurin is an important mediator of homeostatic synaptic plasticity. Taken together, our findings show that synaptic scaling is a homeostatic process that not only enhances synaptic transmission but also maintains calcium signaling in neurons under activity deprivation.
