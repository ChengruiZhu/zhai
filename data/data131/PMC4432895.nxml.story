Of 94 stroke patients with NC, 46 (49%) had NC with SE and 48 (51%) had NC without SE. The onset-to-NC time was significant later in stroke patients with SE than those without SE (P < 0.01). There was a significant difference in body temperature, heart rate, respiratory rate, white blood cell (WBC), systolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic blood pressure (DBP), systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS), acute respiratory failure, septic shock, hypernatremia, and sequential organ failure assessment (SOFA) score between the SE and non-SE group (P < 0.05). On a repeat head imaging, vasogenic edema (P = 0.023) and subcortical white matter lesions (P = 0.011) were significantly higher in patients with SE than those without SE, while hematoma growth (P = 0.000), infarction progress (P = 0.003), and recurrent subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) (P = 0.011) were significantly lower in patients with SE than those without SE. Patients with SE had higher adjusted rates of fever ≥ 39 °C (odds ratio (OR): 2.753; 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.116 - 6.794; P = 0.028) and SIRS ≥ 3 items (OR: 6.459; 95% CI: 2.050 - 20.351; P = 0.001). The 30-day mortality in stroke patients with SE was higher than those without SE (76.1% vs. 45.8%, P = 0.003).
