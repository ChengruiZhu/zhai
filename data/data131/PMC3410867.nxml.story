In order to grow, multicellular organisms need to multiply their cells. Cell proliferation is achieved through a complex order of events called the cell cycle, during which the nuclear DNA is duplicated and subsequently distributed to the newly forming daughter cells. The decision to replicate the nuclear DNA is in many organisms crucial to progress through the entire cell cycle. Alterations of the cell cycle, especially at the entry point, can cause severe developmental defects and are often causal for maladies, such as cancer. Substantial work in yeast and animals has revealed the regulatory steps controlling S-phase entry. In contrast, relatively little is known about the plant cell cycle despite plants being one of the largest classes of living organisms and despite the importance of plants for human life, for instance as the basis of human nutrition. Our work presents a molecular framework of core cell-cycle regulation for entry into the DNA replication phase in the model plant Arabidopsis. We report here the identification of a regulatory cascade that likely functions in many plant cells and organisms. With this, we also provide an important basis for comparative analyses of cell-cycle control between different eukaryotes, such as yeast and mammals.
