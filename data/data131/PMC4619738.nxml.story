Small heat shock proteins (sHSP/HSPB) form a diverse family of ATP-independent chaperones. Some of them protect the proteome against aggregation during stress and others regulate normal biological processes through ill-defined mechanisms. Interactions between HSPB proteins and elements of the cytoskeleton are increasingly linked to their implication in human degenerative diseases and cancer. For instance, a multichaperone complex containing HSPB8 and its co-chaperone BAG3 would maintain muscle cell integrity by promoting the autophagic clearance of damaged components within F-actin structures. Selective autophagy is a targeted protein degradation mechanism for elimination of damaged organelles and proteins. It may also regulate removal of signaling proteins from their functionally relevant sites during intense remodeling of the cytoskeleton, as it occurs during mitosis. Here, we report a novel role for HSPB8 and BAG3 during mitosis in mammalian cells that involves the autophagic receptor p62/SQSTM1. We show that a reduction of any protein within the HSPB8-BAG3-p62/SQSTM signaling axis similarly impairs mitotic progression and chromosome segregation by affecting orientation of the mitotic spindle and assembly of mitotic-specific actin structures. Our findings establish a unique role for HSPB8 in a novel function of BAG3 in mitotic cell division and genome stability, through effect on remodeling of the actin cytoskeleton.
