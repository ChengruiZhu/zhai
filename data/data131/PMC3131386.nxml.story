Transcription is a fundamental step in gene expression, yet it remains poorly understood at cellular level. Textbooks are full of descriptions of promoter-bound transcription factors recruiting RNA polymerase, which initiates transcription before sliding along the transcription unit. However, increasing evidence supports the view that the DNA template bound with transcription factors slides through a relatively immobile RNA polymerase at discrete nuclear sites (known as transcription factories), rather than RNA polymerase sliding along DNA template. Based on this transcription factory model, we build a virtual space in which genes and transcription factors move randomly while transcription factories are immobile. We find that under a large number of parameter ranges, this simple dynamical model is valid for a number of experimental observations. Moreover, we suggest the occurrence of gene co-localization might be mainly due to limited numbers of transcription factors, rather than other factors such as nucleus size or transcription factory number. This work offers insight into the general principles of regulation of transcription and gene expression by simulating the translocation of transcriptional units (genes and transcription factors) using purely random diffusion processes that result in non-random organization of co-regulated genes.
