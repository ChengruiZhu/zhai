 spp.) wherever it occurs. Although eradication programs in the United States have reduced the range of this pest, the weevil remains an intractable problem in subtropical Texas, Mexico, and much of South America. A key to managing the weevil in the subtropics and tropics might lie in better understanding its diapause and overwintering survival in regions characterized by relatively high late-season temperatures. We examined the temporal patterns of acquisition of diapause characters at 18.3, 23.9, and 29.4°C, and the effects of temperature during the diapause-induction period on subsequent host-free survival at 23.9°C. Occurrence of the diapause characters generally increased with weevil age at all temperatures but appeared more rapidly at higher temperatures. Acquisition of the diapause characters tended to occur slightly earlier in female weevils compared with the male weevils. Despite the slower development of diapause characters at lower temperatures, when adult weevils were fed under low temperatures, subsequent host-free survival was enhanced. These results are consistent with reports of increased weevil survival with delayed entry into overwintering. Our findings also suggest that the potential host-free survival facilitated by diapause occurring in subtropical or tropical production regions may be reduced compared with dormancy developing in southern temperate regions. This reduced survival potential emphasizes the importance of a maximized host-free season and suggests that the late-season diapause spray intervals should be short enough to ensure that the number of dormant weevils developing in late-season cotton is minimized.
