White adipose tissue (WAT) expansion is associated with angiogenesis. Although, activation of lipolysis by exercise induces adipocyte hypotrophy and reduction of fat mass, it is poorly understood whether exercise regulates angiogenesis by altering angiogenic gene expression in WAT. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to evaluate the effect of 6 weeks voluntary wheel running exercise on angiogenic gene expression in adipose tissues. Male C57BL/6J mice performed voluntary wheel running for 6 weeks. At 24 hr after the last exercise training, tibialis anterior (TA), soleus (Sol), epididymal WAT (eWAT), inguinal WAT (iWAT), and brown adipose tissue (BAT) were isolated and then the expressions of vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGFA), angiopoietin1 (Ang1), Ang2, platelet-derived growth factor B (PDGF-B) and their corresponding receptors were analyzed by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. In skeletal muscles, VEGFA expression was upregulated in TA and Sol and PDDGF-B expression was increased in Sol after exercise training. In eWAT, the expressions of VEGFA and Flk-1 were dramatically downregulated, whereas Ang2 and PDGFRÎ² was upregulated after exercise training. In iWAT, VEGF expression was increased with the downregulation of Ang1. However, there was no alteration of any of these genes in BAT. These results suggest that angiogenic gene expression is altered by exercise training and voluntary wheel running regulates VEGFA, Ang1, and Ang2 expressions in a fat depot specific manner.
