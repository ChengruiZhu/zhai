The heart is known to adapt size of the cavities and thickness of the walls to the pumping requirements set by blood pressure and blood flow. We think that mechanical load of the cardiac tissue provides feedback signals for adaptation of mass and thickness of the cardiac walls. Many cellular mechanisms are known where mechanical load initiates a cascade of chemical reactions, eventually affecting structure and mass of the tissue. Because these mechanisms interact intricately, understanding of the system of adaptation as a whole is tremendously complicated. We present a novel approach by considering adaptation as a control system. Using the principle that control should converge to a stable end state, general rules are found that should be satisfied on transfer of mechanical load to structural adaptation in the cells of the tissue. We think that deeper understanding of the mechanism of adaptation requires that knowledge on mechano-transductive pathways is placed in the context of regarding adaptation as a system. Knowledge on adaptation of cardiac geometry to mechanical load is crucial in predicting long term effects of pathologic disorders or therapeutic interventions that chronically affect blood pressure or blood flow.
