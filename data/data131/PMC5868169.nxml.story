Mitochondria coordinated a lot of vital cellular processes of energy production and distribution. Change of mitochondrial functions has been implicated in cancer progression. The present study aims to investigate the involvement of mitochondria dynamics in LASS2 induced invasion and chemoresistance of bladder cancer cells. J82 and BIU87 cell lines were used for LASS2 plasmid transfection while siRNA knockdown was carried out in 5637 cell line. Matrigel invasion assay and Annexin V/PI staining demonstrated that LASS2 negatively regulated cancer cell invasion and chemoresistance. JC-1 staining suggested that LASS2 overexpression downregulated mitochondrial membrane potential. Mitotracker staining showed that LASS2 induced mitochondrial fusion and inhibited mitochondrial fission. In addition, LASS2 overexpression downregulated expression of mitochondrial fission protein p-Drp1 Drp1 and Fis1. While depletion of LASS2 exhibited the opposite effects. Drp1 inhibitor Mdivi abolished invasion and chemoresistance induced by LASS2 siRNA. Furthermore, we found that LASS2 overexpression could inhibit phosphorylation of ERK, which act upstream of Drp1. ERK inhibitor PD98059 suppressed Drp1 phosphorylation and abrogated the effects of LASS2 depletion. In conclusion, the present study demonstrated that LASS2 inhibits bladder cancer invasion and chemoresistance through regulation of ERK-Drp1 induced mitochondrial dynamics.
