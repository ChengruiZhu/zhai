Seven rainbow trout cytokine genes (interleukin (IL)-2, IL-8, IL-15, IL-17, IL-1β, intracellular interferon (iIFN) 1a, and IFN-γ2) were evaluated for their adjuvant effects on a DNA vaccine, called pG, containing the glycoprotein gene of infectious hematopoietic necrosis virus (IHNV). Distinct DNA constructs in expression plasmid pcDNA3.1 encoding a cytokine gene were generated. Immunofluorescence assays in rainbow trout gonadal cells demonstrated successful protein expression from all these constructs. Subsequently, fish were immunized with pG alone or together with a cytokine expression plasmid. Results showed that each cytokine plasmids at an appropriate dose showed notable effects on immune gene expression. IL-17 and IFN-γ2 can enhance early specific IgM response. All cytokines, except IL-8, can benefit initial neutralizing antibody (NAb) titers. At 35 days post immunization (dpi), NAb titers of fish immunized with pG and IL-2, iIFN1a, or IFN-γ2 plasmids remained at high levels (1:160). NAb titers of fish immunized with pG alone decreased to 1:40. IL-8 or IL-1β can enhance antigen-specific proliferative T-cell responses at 14 dpi. At 28 dpi, coinjection of pG with IL-2, IL-8, IL-15, or IL-17 plasmids induced considerably stronger lymphocyte proliferation than that with injection of pG alone. All cytokine plasmids delivered with pG plasmid enhanced protection of trout against IHNV-mediated mortality. These results indicate that the type and dose of trout cytokine genes injected into fish affect quality of immune response to DNA vaccination.
