A fundamental problem in neuroscience is understanding how behaviorally relevant information is collected by a sensory organ and subsequently encoded by the brain. By actively moving their whiskers, rats can discriminate fine differences in textures. Little is known, however, about how whisker dynamics reflect texture properties or how the nervous system encodes this information. In one hypothesis, whisker motion over a texture produces a unique, texture-specific temporal profile of velocity, which is encoded in the temporal pattern of neural activity. In a second, alternative hypothesis, textures excite a specific subset of whiskers due to intrinsic, whisker-specific mechanical resonance frequencies. Information is then encoded by the spatial distribution of neural activity in whisker-related columns in cortex. Here, we assess these hypotheses by measuring whisker motion as animals whisk across sandpapers of varying roughness. We found that whiskers resonate in air and on surfaces, but that these resonance vibrations do not vary with, and therefore do not encode, texture. Instead, whisker motion over a textured surface produces fast, transient slip-stick events whose dynamics are dependent on texture roughness. Texture is likely to be encoded in the temporal pattern of spikes evoked by these slip-stick events.
