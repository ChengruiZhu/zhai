The senescence associated secretory phenotype is developed by cells undergoing permanent cell cycle arrest. This phenotype is characterized by the secretion of a variety of factors that facilitate tissue breakdown and inflammation and is therefore theorized to, in part, be causal for aging and age-related diseases. In recent years the SASP has been implicated in a variety of chronic inflammatory diseases. Due to these advances, it is imperative to better understand the dynamics of this cellular phenotype and to find ways to disrupt it. We have developed a Boolean network incorporating the major signaling pathways of the SASP that allows us to specifically investigate interactions of the pathways and genes involved. We validated our model by reliably reproducing published data on the SASP. We utilized our model to uncover components that directly control the detrimental effects of the senescence associated secretory phenotype that are largely caused by IL-6 and IL-8, two major factors of the SASP in establishing and spreading senescence as well as causing local inflammation. In subsequent in-vitro experiments, we were able to verify our computational results and could suggest NEMO as one potential target for therapy of SASP-related diseases.
