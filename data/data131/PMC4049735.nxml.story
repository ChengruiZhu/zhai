Supraglottic adenoid cystic carcinoma (ACC) is extremely rare and may be misdiagnosed as laryngeal amyloidosis. The present report describes a case of supraglottic ACC, which went unrecognized until histopathological examination of the neoplasm 18 months after the first presentation. The present patient presented with progressive hoarseness for half a year and initially required partial resection. Following quick regional recurrence, the patient received a total laryngectomy while refusing radiotherapy. Adjuvant post-operational traditional Chinese medicine was accepted. Over 3 yearsâ€™ follow-up, there was no evidence of regional relapse or distant metastases. The present case is compared with a second case of supraglottic submucosal mass in which the signs, symptoms and examinations were similar to the first case, but that was diagnosed as laryngeal amyloidosis. Attention should be paid to submucosal masses in the larynx to prevent underlying malignancy and subsequent disease progression. Immunocytochemistry, such as p63 staining, is mandatory for making an early differential diagnosis of supraglottic ACC. Traditional Chinese medicine may be a useful adjuvant therapy for this rare disease.
