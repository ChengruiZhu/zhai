Soft tissue tension within parameters described for normal subjects was attained medially and laterally in: maximum extension in all 22 cases. For the 19 cases where the guides were used to plan the flexion resections; normal medial soft tissue tension was attained in 18/19 (94.7%) cases and normal lateral soft tissue tension in 16/19 (84.2%) cases. The 4 cases where normal soft tissue tension was not attained were outside this range by 1°. Post-operatively the mean difference in medial versus lateral laxity was 0.75°at 0°, 1.36° at 20° and 1.20° at 90°of flexion with a range of 0 - 4.5° across all positions and all knees. Pre-operatively the difference between medial and lateral laxity across all knees and positions ranged from 0 – 9°. Preoperatively the mean difference in medial versus lateral laxity was 4.43°at 0°, 5.25° at 20° and 1.64°at 90°of flexion. In the 19 cases where guides planned both the extension and flexion gap, 0 versus 90 ° flexion laxity on the medial side displayed a mean difference of 1.18° (range 0 - 3) and on the lateral side a mean difference of 1.52° (range 0 - 4.5) was recorded. To attain these balance parameters 16/22 (72.7%) cases utilised a 9mm poly and 6/22 (27.3%) utilised an 11mm poly.
