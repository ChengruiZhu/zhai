Smell of very low dose of chemical might evoke subjective physical symptoms in human by some process of learning named the aversion conditioning. But few scientific evidences of the hypothesis have been reported so far. Validity of conditioned odor aversion (COA) using low-doses of organic solvent as odor conditioned stimulus (CS) was examined. In conditioning phase, water-deprived male Sprague-Dawley rats were presented low, medium or high dose solution for 30 min followed by 0.3 M Lithium Chloride (LiCl) solution or saline injection. The xylene solution and drink water were simultaneously provided on the next day as two-bottle test. Consumption of medium dose of xylene solution was significantly decreased in LiCl injection group as compared with saline group. There was no difference between LiCl and saline injected animals in low group. Animals in high dose did not access to xylene even on the conditioning. These results indicate that animals showed high sensitivity for discrimination against concentration of xylene and that the medium dose of xylene functioned as the CS. We concluded that the COA used in the present study may be one of useful procedures to investigate olfaction of animal.
