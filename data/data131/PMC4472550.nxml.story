Invasive pulmonary aspergillosis (IPA) is difficult to diagnose because it requires histopathology and tissue culture, as well as due to its rapid progression. Invasive pulmonary aspergillosis is the primary cause of pulmonary mycosis in China, which can occur in patients with neutrophil deficiency, leukaemia or lymphoma, malignant tumours, or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease with long-term corticosteroid use or bacterial exacerbations. Such fungal infections can lead to disseminated disease and death within weeks, and the mortality rate for untreated invasive aspergillosis is high. Therefore, increased awareness of invasive aspergillosis in non-traditional hosts is warranted due to the high mortality rate experienced by patients with this disease. Invasive pulmonary aspergillosis has become a principal cause of life-threatening infections in immunocompromised patients. Invasive aspergillosis frequently involves the lung parenchyma and is infrequently accompanied by soft tissue lesions. We present an unusual case of a patient with agranulocytosis that was caused by methimazole that was given to control his hyperthyroidism, and IPA that was accompanied by unusual maxillofacial soft tissue swelling that required treatment with voriconazole. Upon follow-up 11 months later, a chest computed tomography scan (CT) revealed that most lesions had been completely absorbed. Moreover, his maxillofacial ulcers had become encrusted, and the soft tissue swelling had subsided.
