Minimal deviation adenocarcinoma (MDA), also known as adenoma malignum of the uterine cervix, accounts for only ~1% of uterine cervical adenocarcinomas. Adenoma malignum of the uterine cervix was initially described by Gusserow in 1870. Using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), MDA appears as multilocular lesions with solid components that extend from the endocervical glands to the deep cervical stroma. Cytological evaluation and biopsies have low detection rates, therefore, it is difficult to diagnose MDA accurately prior to treatment. The current study describes a rare case of MDA that was difficult to differentiate from endometrial adenocarcinoma of the corpus uteri preoperatively, as the endometrial biopsy results suggested a well-differentiated endometrioid adenocarcinoma and MRI did not show typical images for MDA. A total abdominal hysterectomy with bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy was performed under the diagnosis of endometrial cancer, and the mass was subsequently diagnosed as MDA of the uterine cervix by pathological examination of the hysterectomy specimen. Postoperatively, although two types of adjuvant chemotherapy were performed, the remaining tumor continued to grow, causing obstruction of the bilateral ureters and leading to bilateral hydronephrosis. The patient is currently alive with the disease 10 months following the surgery.
