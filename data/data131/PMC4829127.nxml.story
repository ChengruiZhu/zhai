 rat model of AMI by occluding the left anterior descending coronary artery. NaHS (0.39, 0.78 or 1.56 mg/kg, intraperitoneally), the GSK-3β inhibitor, SB216763 (0.6 mg/kg, intravenously), or 1% dimethylsulfoxide (2 ml/kg, intravenously) were administered to the rats. The results demonstrated that the administration of medium- and high-dose NaHS and SB216763 significantly improved rat cardiac function, as evidenced by an increase in the mean arterial pressure, left ventricular developed pressure, contraction and relaxation rates, as well as a decrease in left ventricular end-diastolic pressure. In addition, the administration of NaHS and SB216763 attenuated myocardial injury as reflected by a decrease in apoptotic cell death and in the serum lactate dehydrogenase concentrations, and prevented myocardial structural changes. The administration of NaHS and SB216763 increased the concentrations of phosphorylated (p-)GSK-3β, the p-GSK-3β/t-GSK-3β ratio and downstream protein β-catenin. Moreover, western blot and immunohistochemical analyses of apoptotic signaling pathway proteins further established the cardioprotective potential of NaHS, as reflected by the upregulation of Bcl-2 expression, the downregulation of Bax expression, and a decrease in the number of TUNEL-positive stained cells. These findings suggest that hydrosulfide exerts cardioprotective effects against AMI-induced apoptosis through the GSK-3β/β-catenin signaling pathway.
