The hypervariable region 1 (HVR1) comprising the first 27â€…aa of E2 glycoprotein is a target for neutralizing antibodies against hepatitis C virus (HCV), but the mechanisms of this neutralization in the cell-culture-infectious genotype 2a strain JFH1 HCV virus (HCVcc) system are unknown. Two rabbit polyclonal sera, R1020 and R140, recognizing the HVR1 of the genotype 1a isolates H77c and Glasgow (Gla), respectively, and a Gla HVR1-specific mouse mAb AP213 have been described previously. However, attempts to generate of antibodies to the JFH1 HVR1 were unsuccessful. Therefore, this study produced chimeric JFH1 HCVcc viruses harbouring the H77c or Gla HVR1 to assess the reactivity of antibodies to this region and their effects on virus infectivity. The inter-genotypic HVR1 swap did not significantly affect virus infectivity. The genotype 1a HVR1-specific antibodies neutralized chimeric viruses in an isolate-dependent manner, underlining the role of HVR1 in HCV infection. The neutralizing antibodies reacted mainly with the C-terminal portion of HVR1, and detailed mapping identified A17, F20 and Q21 in the Gla HVR1 sequence and T21 (and possibly L20) in the corresponding H77c sequence as key epitope residues for AP213 and R140, and R1020, respectively. Importantly, none of the antibodies inhibited
