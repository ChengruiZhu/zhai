Neurofilaments are central determinants of the diameter of myelinated axons. It is less clear whether neurofilaments serve other functional roles such as maintaining the structural integrity of axons over time. Here we show that an age-dependent axonal atrophy develops in the lumbar ventral roots of mice with a null mutation in the mid-sized neurofilament subunit (NF-M) but not in animals with a null mutation in the heavy neurofilament subunit (NF-H). Mice with null mutations in both genes develop atrophy in ventral and dorsal roots as well as a hind limb paralysis with aging. The atrophic process is not accompanied by significant axonal loss or anterior horn cell pathology. In the NF-M–null mutant atrophic ventral root, axons show an age-related depletion of neurofilaments and an increased ratio of microtubules/neurofilaments. By contrast, the preserved dorsal root axons of NF-M–null mutant animals do not show a similar depletion of neurofilaments. Thus, the lack of an NF-M subunit renders some axons selectively vulnerable to an age-dependent atrophic process. These studies argue that neurofilaments are necessary for the structural maintenance of some populations of axons during aging and that the NF-M subunit is especially critical.
