 invasion of BxPC-3 cells (a pancreatic carcinoma cell line), and to analyze the value of joint detection of HPSE and VEGF-C for PDAC patients. A recombinant plasmid, GV230/HPSE was constructed and BxPC-3 cells were transiently transfected with GV230/HPSE or siRNA against HPSE. The expression levels of HPSE and VEGF-C were compared using reverse transcription quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) and immunoblotting. The metastatic potential of treated BxPC-3 cells was evaluated using a Transwell® invasion assay. The relative mRNA levels of HPSE and VEGF-C in 34 PDAC specimens were assessed by RT-qPCR. The results of the RT-qPCR demonstrated a 10.7- and 3.24-fold elevation (P<0.01) of HPSE mRNA and VEGF-C mRNA, respectively, in GV230/HPSE group, whereas the HPSE siRNA group were downregulated for these mRNAs (−2.45-fold, P<0.01; −1.84-fold, P<0.01). The same pattern for protein expression was detected using immunoblot assays. In Transwell® invasion assays 138±5 cells in GV230/HPSE group and 53±4 cells in siRNA group migrated through the Matrigel®. A negative correlation between the mRNA levels of HPSE and VEGF-C in PDAC specimens and the prognosis factors of the postoperative patients was identified. Spearman rank correlation analysis indicated a positive correlation between HPSE and VEGF-C in PDAC (r=0.812, P<0.01). HPSE regulates the expression of VEGF-C and facilitates invasion of BxPC-3
