Proteins are synthesized by ribosomes that translate codons into amino acids while moving along mRNA transcripts. Various factors can influence the speed of this fundamental process, but the observed heterogeneity of ribosome density along transcript sequences remains only partially explained. Using a probabilistic model of the translation dynamics, we introduce a method to infer the position-specific translation speed of each transcript and the overall protein production rate, from ribosome footprint density information. Applying our method to experimental data allow us to quantify the extent of closely-stacked ribosomes hidden from the original data and more precisely the amount of interference between two abutting ribosomes. Also, we study the determinants of translation speed and show that neither ribosomal interference nor the distribution of slowly decoded codons is sufficient to explain the observed variation in the mean elongation rate across the transcript sequence. By using a statistical model, we find that these variations are largely explained by biophysical features, such as the amount of electric charges and the hydrophobic properties of the nascent polypeptide in specific windows, and this result can be explained by the interactions between the ribosome exit tunnel and the nascent polypeptide sequence located inside it.
