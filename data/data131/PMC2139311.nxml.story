 The ultrastructural features of B-, T-, and surface Ig(sIg)-bearing cells have been studied on cell suspensions from lymphoid organs of mice at different stages of immunization. The cells were identified by exposure to rabbit antibodies against mouse-specific lymphocyte antigens (MSLA) or brain-associated θ antigen (BAθ) for T cells, mouse-specific bone marrow-derived lymphocyte antigens (MBLA) for B cells, and mouse Ig for sIg-bearing cells. The rabbit antibodies fixed on the cell surfaces were detected by peroxidase-labeled sheep anti-rabbit Ig antibodies or by a "bridge" technique using southern bean mosaic virus or bacteriophage T4 as the final markers. In some experiments, short-lived lymphoid cells were labeled in vivo with repeated tritiated thymidine and the ultrastructural detection of their surface antigens was combined with radioautography. MBLA+ lymphoid cells showed a whole range of ultrastructural patterns. Most were small and medium-sized lymphocytes with a clear cytoplasm containing mono- and polyribosomes, but they comprised also blasts and large cells with various amounts of endoplasmic reticulum, as well as plasma cells at different stages of maturation. sIg-bearing cells appeared to be identical with MBLA+ cells, except that sIg was less easily detectable on large blasts, and only very rarely observed on plasma cells. MSLA+ and BAθ+ cells fell into three categories. One of them (T
