). Cells were grown in Leibovitz’s L-15 medium with 10% fetal bovine serum following standard procedures. The optimum growth temperatures for these lines ranged from 15°C to 25°C. All cells survived storage for at least 3 yr at −80°C. Subsequently, they were continuously cultured until the 78th generation without evident changes in their morphology. Moreover, we were able to culture KSG cells in the absence of fetal bovine serum in a culture medium containing the fish serum “SeaGrow.” Optimum SeaGrow concentrations for these cells ranged from 5% to 20%. The growth rate of KSG cells decreased when the concentration of SeaGrow was reduced to 1%. However, this decrease could be partially reversed by adding 0.5% “Hy-Fish.” In addition, the inclusion of Hy-Fish improved cell adhesion. KSG cells that were cultured in serum-free culture media containing 0.5% and 1% Hy-Fish had been added and were able to survive at low densities. Furthermore, we successfully transfected this cell line with a commercial plasmid vector coding a fluorescent protein using the cationic lipid. Finally, the analyses of cell behavior under hydrostatic pressure showed that some pressures (10 MPa) helped the cells to proliferate more.
