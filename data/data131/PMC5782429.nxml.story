Balloon dilation of the Eustachian tube has been recently introduced as a novel and minimally invasive method for treating chronic obstructive Eustachian tube dysfunction. For the first time worldwide, we assessed the role of this technique in the treatment of children with Eustachian tube dysfunction who did not respond to other treatments. We retrospectively analysed the medical records of 60 children (mean age: 6.3 years, range: 28 months to 12 years) who underwent balloon dilation of the Eustachian tube using the Bielefeld balloon catheter. In addition, the parents of a further 66 children who underwent balloon dilation (mean age: 8 years, range: 4 to 13 years) were asked to complete a standardised written questionnaire and were interviewed by telephone about the postoperative course of their children. There were no complications during surgery. Clinical symptoms improved in more than 80% of patients. No patient reported a deterioration of symptoms. Of the participating parents, 81.3% were very satisfied or satisfied with the outcome of treatment. Balloon dilation is a rapid, simple and safe method for the treatment of both adults and children with Eustachian tube dysfunction that does not respond to other treatments. Further studies, ideally multicentre studies, are required in order to optimise the definition of existing and potential new indications for this treatment approach and to establish this treatment in the management of children with refractory chronic Eustachian tube dysfunction.
