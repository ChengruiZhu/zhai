A murine cloned Th cell line specific for the antigen conalbumin in the context of self I-A molecules can be activated by low concentrations of soluble antireceptor mAb. By using an antireceptor mAb to shared antigenic determinants on T cell receptors, we have shown that the ability to be activated by soluble antireceptor mAb is an unusual, although not unique, feature of this cloned T cell line. This activation does not involve occult APC, FcR, or interaction between individual cloned T cells, as limiting-dilution analysis shows that individual cells of this clone will grow in the presence of the antireceptor antibody and IL-1 as stimulus. This cloned T cell line is highly immunogenic in vivo, giving rise to antireceptor antibodies that stimulate its growth in both mice and rats. This response is not dependent upon exogenous T cells. Rather, the clone directly interacts with complementary B cells, as shown by the production of mAb in nude mice, and by production of stimulating antireceptor antibodies by purified B cells cultured with cloned Th cells in vitro. Several features of this cloned Th cell line, most especially its ability to be activated, rather than inhibited, by antireceptor antibodies, may account for its striking ability to directly activate B cells bearing complementary receptors. The direct interaction of the cloned Th cell with B cells bearing complementary receptors may serve as a model for receptor-receptor interactions in the generation of both T and B cell repertoires.
