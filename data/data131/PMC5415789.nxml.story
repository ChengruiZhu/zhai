Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) play critical and complicated roles in the regulation of various biological processes, including chromatin modification, transcription and post-transcriptional processing. Interestingly, some lncRNAs serve as miRNA “sponges” that inhibit interaction with miRNA targets in post-transcriptional regulation. We constructed a putative competing endogenous RNA (ceRNA) network by integrating lncRNA, miRNA and mRNA expression based on high-throughput RNA sequencing and microarray data to enable a comparison of the SHEE and SHEEC cell lines. Using Targetscan and miRanda bioinformatics algorithms and miRTarbase microRNA-target interactions database, we established that 51 miRNAs sharing 13,623 MREs with 2260 genes and 82 lncRNAs were involved in this ceRNA network. Through a biological function analysis, the ceRNA network appeared to be primarily involved in cell proliferation, apoptosis, the cell cycle, invasion and metastasis. Functional pathway analyses demonstrated that the ceRNA network potentially modulated multiple signaling pathways, such as the MAPK, Ras, HIF-1, Rap1, and PI3K/Akt signaling pathways. These results might provide new clues to better understand the regulation of the ceRNA network in cancer.
