Parathyroid hormone-related protein (PTHrP) is known to induce bone resorption by activating RANKL as well as PTH. PTHrP plays a central role in humoral hypercalcemia, and its expression has been reported to be closely associated with bone metastasis of breast carcinoma. PTHrP expression in oral squamous carcinoma cell lines was investigated, and PTHrP was expressed in oral squamous cell carcinoma cell lines similar to that in a prostate carcinoma cell line. Mucoepidermoid carcinoma is the most common malignant salivary gland tumor composed of different types of cells including a squamous component. Its clinical behavior is highly variable and ranges from slow-growing and indolent to locally aggressive and highly metastatic. We examined the PTHrP expression in mucoepidermoid carcinoma and assessed the significance of its correlation with clinicopathological features. Immunohistochemical detection of PTHrP was carried out in 21 cases of mucoepidermoid carcinoma in the head and neck region. PTHrP was highly detectable in intermediate and epidermoid cells, and abundant expression of PTHrP in intermediate cells had a significant association with cancer malignancy, including lymph node metastasis and/or tumor recurrence. These results suggest that PTHrP expression can be used as a prognostic factor for mucoepidermoid carcinoma.
