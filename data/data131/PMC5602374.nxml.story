The total number of individual ICTs registered in the set timeframe was 822. Primary ICTs represented a total of 66.12% of the histologically confirmed cases, with the most common entries being tumors from a glial and meningeal origin, 30.90% were histologically confirmed as metastatic ICTs, from which the most common entries were of pulmonary origin, and the other 2.94% were NVOL. On behalf of their intracranial metastatic location, metastatic tumors were located predominantly in the supratentorial region, represented as a total of 87.80%, while the other 12.20% were located in the subtentorial region. Based on the descriptive analysis, the annual incidence per 100,000 capita of all ICTs is 9.12, comprised of 6.03 per 100,000 for primary ICTs, 2.82 per 100,000 for metastatic ICTs, and 0.27 per 100,000 for NVOL. The annual incidence of the most commonly diagnosed primary ICTs per 100,000 is 2.36 for meningioma, 2.03 for glioblastoma, and 0.48 for pituitary adenoma. The annual incidence of the most commonly diagnosed metastatic ICTs per 100,000 is 1.32 for lung cancer metastases, 0.28 for gastrointestinal tract (GIT) metastases, 0.22 for melanoma, and 0.17 for breast cancer metastases.
