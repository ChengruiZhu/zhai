Retroperitoneal haematomas in obstetrics are uncommon. The causes and pathogenesis of retroperitoneal haematomas lack clarity and the aim of this review is to recognise retroperitoneal haematomas as a separate entity from commonly seen vaginal and pelvic haematomas. It is time to raise awareness among obstetricians to recognise retroperitoneal haematomas as an important cause of maternal morbidity and mortality which requires high clinical suspicion and multidisciplinary input. As retroperitoneal haematomas are rare but can cause serious threat to maternal wellbeing, resources should be directed towards their management. Existing guidelines of maternal collapse and morbidity during pregnancy and puerperium need to include retroperitoneal haematomas as one of the important causes of maternal shock or morbidity. New learning pathways should be opted for to increase awareness of retroperitoneal haematomas among obstetricians enabling them to reflect on their implications while managing retroperitoneal haematomas. Management of retroperitoneal haematomas is complex and continues to improve with advancements in the investigative strategies, treatment options and multidisciplinary involvement.
