A liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-ESI-MS/MS) method was developed and validated for the determination of yakuchinone A in rat plasma. Mass spectrometric and chromatographic conditions were optimized. Plasma samples were pretreated by protein precipitation with methanol. LC separation was performed on a Phenomenex Luna C18 column with gradient elution using a mobile phase consisting of methanol–water containing 0.5 mM formic acid (HCOOH) at a flow rate of 0.28 mL/min. ESI-MS spectra were acquired in positive ion multiple reaction monitoring mode (MRM). The precursor-to-product ion pairs used for MRM of yakuchinone A and yakuchinone B were m/z 313.1 → 137.0 and 311.2 → 117.1, respectively. Low concentration of HCOOH reduced the ion suppression caused by matrix components and clearly improved the analytical sensitivity. Yakuchinone A showed good linearity over a wide concentration range (r > 0.99). The accuracy, precision, stability and linearity were found to be within the acceptable criteria. This new method was successfully applied to analyze the rat plasma concentration of parent yakuchinone A after a single oral administration of SuoQuan capsules. Low systemic exposure to parent yakuchinone A was observed.
