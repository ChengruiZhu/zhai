Study about blood pressure variation in the first 24 hours post-operation is limited in patients with adrenal aldosterone-producing adenoma. We aim to evaluate the potential predictors for postoperative hypertension urgency during the first 24 hours after laparoscopic adrenalectomy in patients with aldosterone-producing adenoma. Clinical data of 177 patients with aldosterone-producing adenoma were retrospectively collected from January 2009 to December 2015 and the potential factors that may influence postoperative blood pressure during the first 24 hours after surgery were analyzed. The factors included gender, age, body mass index, preoperative maximum systolic blood pressure, number of antihypertensive medicines, preoperative spironolactone treatment, duration of hypertension, surgical method and approach, adenoma diameter, preoperative proteinuria, estimated glomerular filtration rate, serum potassium and serum aldosterone. Univariate and multivariate regression analyses were used to evaluate the relationship between the above variables and postoperative hypertension urgency. We found that the proportion of patients with a higher systolic blood pressure ≥ 160 mmHg and ≥ 180 mmHg were significantly increased post-operation (both
