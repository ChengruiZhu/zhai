Pseudo-Relevance Feedback (PRF) is a well-known method of query expansion for improving the performance of information retrieval systems. All the terms of PRF documents are not important for expanding the user query. Therefore selection of proper expansion term is very important for improving system performance. Individual query expansion terms selection methods have been widely investigated for improving its performance. Every individual expansion term selection method has its own weaknesses and strengths. To overcome the weaknesses and to utilize the strengths of the individual method, we used multiple terms selection methods together. In this paper, first the possibility of improving the overall performance using individual query expansion terms selection methods has been explored. Second, Borda count rank aggregation approach is used for combining multiple query expansion terms selection methods. Third, the semantic similarity approach is used to select semantically similar terms with the query after applying Borda count ranks combining approach. Our experimental results demonstrated that our proposed approaches achieved a significant improvement over individual terms selection method and related state-of-the-art methods.
