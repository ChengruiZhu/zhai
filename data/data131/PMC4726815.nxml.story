Changes in synaptic strength, which can include long-term potentiation and long-term depression, are important for learning and the encoding of memories across the brain. Long-term depression (LTD), in particular, is thought to be essential for motor learning in the cerebellum, and disruption of this process, by disease or injury, can result in severe motor dysfunction. Cerebellar LTD is achieved by reducing the population of AMPA receptors at the Purkinje cell postsynaptic membrane. This population is maintained by a dynamic trafficking loop, in which AMPA receptors are continuously removed from the postsynaptic membrane by endocytosis and reinserted by exocytosis. Specific phosphorylation sites on the AMPA receptors regulate their interaction with proteins that either stabilise the receptors at the membrane or promote their trafficking. We develop a detailed bidirectional computational model of this trafficking loop and its regulation. The model shows how perturbing the trafficking balance towards AMPA receptor mobilisation and endocytosis can account for rapid induction of cerebellar LTD, and suggests mechanistic explanations for numerous features observed experimentally. This deepens our understanding of cerebellar LTD and provides a foundation for further experimental studies of this synaptic process.
