Hepatic fibrosis is a common response to virtually all forms of chronic liver injury independent of the etiologic agent. Despite the relatively large population of patients suffering from hepatic fibrosis and cirrhosis, no efficient and well-tolerated drugs are available for the treatment of this disorder. The lack of efficient treatment options is at least partly because the underlying cellular mechanisms leading to hepatic fibrosis are only partly understood. It is thus of pivotal importance to better understand the cellular processes contributing to the progression of hepatic fibrosis. Interestingly in this perspective, a common feature of fibrotic disease of various organs is the activation of the coagulation cascade and hepatic fibrosis is also accompanied by a local hypercoagulable state. Activated blood coagulation factors directly target liver cells by activating protease-activated receptors (PAR) thereby inducing a plethora of cellular responses like (among others) proliferation, migration and extracellular matrix production. Coagulation factor driven PAR activation thus establishes a potential link between activation of the coagulation cascade and the progression of fibrosis. The current review focuses on blood coagulation factor Xa and summarizes the variety of cellular functions induced by factor Xa-driven PAR-2 activation and the subsequent consequences for tissue repair and hepatic fibrosis.
