Renal cell carcinoma accounts for more than 90% of kidney cancers. Papillary renal cell carcinoma (pRCC) is the second most common subtype of renal cell carcinoma. Previous studies, focusing mostly on the protein-coding regions, have identified several key genomic alterations that are critical to cancer initiation and development. However, researchers cannot find any key mutation in a significant portion of pRCC. Therefore, we carry out the first whole-genome study of pRCC to discover triggering DNA changes explaining these cases. By looking at the entire genome, we find additional potentially impactful alterations both in and out of the protein-coding regions. These newly identified critical mutations from scrutinizing the entire genome help complete our understanding of pRCC genomes. Two alterations we find are associated with prognosis, which could aid clinical decisions. We are also able to unveil mutation patterns, signatures and tumor evolutionary structures, which reflect the mutagenesis processes and help understand how heterogeneity arises. Our study provides valuable additional information to facilitate better tumor subtyping, risk stratification and potentially clinical management.
