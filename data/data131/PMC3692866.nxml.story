Analysis of data collected from 110,208 patients 3 years and older who presented with pharyngitis to a national retail health chain, from 2006–08. Practitioners collected standardized historical and physical exam information based on algorithm-driven care, and all patients with pharyngitis were tested for GAS. We used a previously validated biosurveillance variable reflecting disease incidence called recent local proportion positive (RLPP), which represents the proportion of patients who tested GAS positive in a local market in the previous 14 days. To derive the “home score,” candidate variables were restricted to demographic factors, historical items and the RLPP, while physical exam variables (such as exudate), were excluded. Multivariate analytic techniques were used to identify predictors of GAS. For each home score (0–100), we calculated the percent of patients who tested positive, and we examined the relationship between the home score and GAS positivity. Standard metrics (sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive value, and AUC) were used to compare the performance of the home score to standard scores. We computed the number of patients aged >= 15 years who, according to the home score, were at low risk for GAS, and therefore might avoid or delay a trip to a medical provider. Outcomes included the numbers of reduced visits and the number of additional missed GAS cases compared to the standard Centor score approach (Do not test/Do not treat if Centor score is 0–1). To facilitate comparison across different risk thresholds, we calculated outcomes for hypothetical cohorts of 1000 patients, and extrapolated these findings to provide the impact on 12 million annual national pharyngitis visits.
