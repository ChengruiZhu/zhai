The increasing food demands from an expanding population necessitate global efforts to increase crop production and ensure food security. The rate of nitrogen (N) fertilizer application is strongly related to crop yield. However, although the application of N fertilizer significantly increases the number of tillers in rice, late emerging tillers usually produce lower yields compared with early emerging tillers. Understanding the physiological constraints of late emerging rice tillers is critical for further increasing rice grain yields. Two-year field experiments, consisting of four nitrogen fertilizer levels, were conducted in order to study variations in the physiological characteristics of different types of tillers. The results revealed that the contributions of late emerging tillers to population rice grain yields improved with increased N levels. However, spikelets per panicle and the grain filling of late emerging tillers were significantly lower than that of the main stems or early emerging tillers under all N levels. The nitrogen harvest index of late emerging tillers was lower than that of main stems and early emerging tillers, and differences gradually increased under higher N rates. Nutrient source deficiency was a primary factor for the low productivity of late emerging tillers. Additionally, rapid malondialdehyde accumulation and delayed emergence determined the short growth duration of late emerging tillers. Further, low actual photochemistry efficacy (Î¦
