Protein-protein interactions are central to many physiological processes. Traditionally, the atomic structure of the isolated proteins, as obtained from X-ray crystallography or NMR spectroscopy, has been thought to determine the molecular recognition and binding process. However, this view has been challenged by the discovery of natively unstructured proteins, including many human transcription factors, which assume ordered molecular structures only upon binding to their targets. Understanding these transitions from a dissociated and unfolded state to a bound and folded state is key to unraveling how transcription factors, proteins involved in the system that controls the transcription of genetic information from DNA to RNA, perform their function. We conducted molecular simulations to study the binding of a well characterized transcription/co-transcription factor complex. We found that the transcription factor is unstructured when binding to its partner, with folding into an ordered structure occurring only after the initial binding event. The resulting coupled folding-and-binding mechanism is found to be in accord with state-of-the-art experimental data. Transcription-factor binding in an unstructured state may confer an advantage in protein target recognition by accelerating the rate of association without compromising the ability to bind to a diverse set of proteins with high specificity and yet relatively low affinity.
