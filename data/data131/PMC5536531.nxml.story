Coronary heart disease is the main cause of mortality in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA), a disease known to be associated with accelerated atherosclerosis. The role of inflammation and immunity in atherosclerotic process offers possible explanations for the increased cardiovascular risk in patients with RA. The immune response to citrullinated peptides has been extensively studied in RA; antibodies directed to citrullinated peptides are now a cornerstone for RA diagnosis. However, few studies have investigated the response to citrullinated peptides and the development of atherosclerotic plaque. Antibodies to carbamylated proteins can be detected before the clinical onset of RA, suggesting a potential predictive role for these antibodies; on the other hand, carbamylation of lipoproteins has been described in patients with cardiovascular disease. This review examines the role of citrullination and carbamylation, two post-translational protein modifications that appear to be involved in the pathogenesis of both RA and atherosclerosis, expanding the similarities between these two diseases. Further investigation on the role of the immune response to modified proteins may contribute to a better comprehension of cardiovascular disease in patients with RA.
