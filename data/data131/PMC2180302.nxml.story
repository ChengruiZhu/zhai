 is the difference of electric potential across the specified areas of skin (electrodes 12 cm. apart). In general, there are abnormalities of the circulation of the blood or of the functions of the skin of persons for whom the metabolic rates determined by the two methods (difference of electric potentials and gasometric procedures) do not agree with Â±4 points. Manifest retardation or return to normality in the rate of circulation of the blood, such as may be produced by the sphygmomanometric cuff under varying pressures, produces marked changes in the difference of electric potentials obtained across a specified intervening area of skin. Retardation of flow of blood produces increased differences of electric potential. Preliminary investigations indicate that there is an inverse correlation between cutaneous temperatures and differences of electric potential. Day by day variations, emotive effects and the partaking of food have less effect, in general, on the electric potentials across a specified area of skin than they have on the metabolic rates. These experimental results indicate that there may be a more direct correlation between electric potentials and the circulation of the blood
