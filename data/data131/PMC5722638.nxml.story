Two thousand seven hundred and thirty-four headache patients met the eligibility criteria. A total of 117 Calgary ER physicians were included, all of whom had seen 10 or more headache patients over the study period. Physician practice variation was vast, with a mean ordering rate of 38.0% and a range of 0% to 95% (M = 39.0%, IQR = 21.0%). CTs were ordered more often in males than females (39.9%; 34.1%; p = 0.002) and in patients presenting during the day and evening (38.1%; 39.0%) compared to the night (29.7%; p < 0.001). Patients were divided into quartiles by age, with the oldest group (41.6 - 50 years) receiving significantly more head CTs (45.1%) than the other quartiles (34.9%; 34.9%; 27.5%; p < 0.001). Longer triage-to-discharge times were associated with an increase in CT ordering rates (12% for < 2.95 hours; 35% for > 4 hour wait; p < 0.001). Lastly, patients who did not have a CT were more likely to revisit the ED within seven days compared to those who did (6.9% vs 4.0%; p = 0.003), but their seven-day admission rate was unaffected (0.6% in the group that got CTs and 0.3% in the group that did not get a CT). Time to assessment, the day of the week, physician gender, years of experience, and training program did not influence CT ordering practices.
