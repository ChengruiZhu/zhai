Toll‐like receptors (TLRs) are essential immunoreceptors involved in host defence against invading microbes. Recent studies indicate that certain TLRs activate immunological autophagy to eliminate microbes. It remains unknown whether TLRs regulate autophagy to play a role in the heart. This study examined this question. The activation of TLR3 in cultured cardiomyocytes was observed to increase protein levels of autophagic components, including LC3‐II, a specific marker for autophagy induction, and p62/SQSTM1, an autophagy receptor normally degraded in the final step of autophagy. The results of transfection with a tandem mRFP‐GFP‐LC3 adenovirus and use of an autophagic flux inhibitor chloroquine both suggested that TLR3 in cardiomyocytes promotes autophagy induction without affecting autophagic flux. Gene‐knockdown experiments showed that the TRIF‐dependent pathway mediated the autophagic effect of TLR3. In the mouse model of chronic myocardial infarction, persistent autophagy was observed, concomitant with up‐regulated TLR3 expression and increased TLR3‐Trif signalling. Germline knockout (KO) of TLR3 inhibited autophagy, reduced infarct size, attenuated heart failure and improved survival. These protective effects were abolished by
