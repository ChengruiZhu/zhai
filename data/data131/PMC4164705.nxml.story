Localization of each keratin isoform differs among epidermal layers. Proliferating basal cells synthesize keratin 14 (K14) and suprabasal cells express keratin 10 (K10) in normal skin. Notch signaling is essential for keratinocyte differentiation. Notch1 is expressed in all epidermal layers, Notch2 in the basal cell layer and Notch3 in basal cell and spinous cell layers in normal epidermis. It has been poorly elucidated how localization and expression levels of Notch molecules are related to epidermal molecular markers K10 and K14 in psoriatic skin with abnormal differentiation of epidermal tissue. This study aimed to investigate the relationship between abnormal differentiation of epidermal cells in psoriatic skin and expression of Notch molecules. We investigated keratins (K14 and K10) and Notches (1, 2, 3 and 4) using immunohistochemistry in psoriatic skin (n=30) and normal skin (n=10). In normal skin, K14 and K10 were discretely observed in the basal cell layer and suprabasal layer, respectively. In psoriatic skin, K14 was expressed in the pan epidermal layer while it and K10 were co-expressed in some middle suprabasal layer cells. Notch1, 2, 3, and 4 localized in all epidermal layers in normal skin. In psoriatic skin, Notch1, 2, and 4 mainly localized in suprabasilar layers and Notch3 is lacalized in pan epidermal, suprabasilar, and basilar layers. Protein and mRNA of Notch1, 2, and 3 isoforms decreased in psoriatic epidermis compared with normal epidermis. These data suggest that decrements in these Notch molecules might cause aberrant expression of K10 and K14 leading to anomalous differentiation of the epidermis in psoriatic lesions.
