Integrin, beta-like 1 (ITGBL1), a Î²-integrin-related extracellular matrix protein, was found more commonly up-regulated in gastric cancer (GC) by screening and analyzing Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) and Oncomine databases, reminding us to explore its prognostic significance in GC. In our current study, we observed that ITGBL1 expression was significantly up-regulated in GC compared with normal controls in clinical specimens. In addition, elevated ITGBL1 expression was positively correlated with patients' tumor-node-metastasis (TNM) stage and distant metastasis. Kaplan-Meier analysis indicated that high ITGBL1 expression was significantly associated with shorter survival times in GC patients. Multivariate Cox regression analysis confirmed ITGBL1 expression as an independent prognostic factor in GC. Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) of multiple GEO datasets revealed a close relationship between ITGBL1 expression and the KRAS/epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) signaling pathway. In conclusion, these data provide evidences that ITGBL1 is a potential predictor and may be involved in cancer cell invasion and metastasis via inducing EMT, and the ITGBL1-related pathways may represent a novel therapeutic strategy for treatment of GC.
