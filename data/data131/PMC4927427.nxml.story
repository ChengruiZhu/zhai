The importance of understanding all gender facial differences is critical in providing a successful cosmetic outcome. Men are a growing segment of the cosmetic industry. Understanding of the male face and its appropriate treatment with minimally invasive cosmetic procedures are essential. The aim was to investigate various facial ratios in Indian American men and to compare them with the Indian and Caucasian norms. Additionally, we wanted to evaluate whether these values satisfy golden and silver ratios. Direct facial anthropometric measurements were made using a digital caliper in 100 Indian American men students (18â€“30 years) at the American University of Antigua (AUA), Antigua. A set of facial ratios were calculated and compared with coefficients of variation (CV). Most of the facial ratios had small CV thus making them highly reliable due to reduced intra-sample variability. The upper face to face height and mandibulo upper face height indices were close to golden ratios whereas mandibulo lower face height, upper face height biocular width, and nasal indices were close to silver ratios. There was significant difference in most of the values when compared with previous studies. The present facial ratios data can be used as a reference value for Indian American men.
