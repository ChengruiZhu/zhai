Approximately one in six men are diagnosed with Prostate Cancer every year in the Western world. Although it can be well managed and non-life threatening in the early stages, over time many patients cease to respond to treatment and develop castrate resistant prostate cancer (CRPC). CRPC represents a clinically challenging and lethal form of prostate cancer. Progression of CRPC is, in part, driven by the ability of cancer cells to alter their metabolic profile during the course of tumourgenesis and metastasis so that they can survive in oxygen and nutrient-poor environments and even withstand treatment. This work was carried out as a continuation of a study aimed towards gaining greater mechanistic understanding of how conditions within the tumour microenvironment impact on both androgen sensitive (LNCaP) and androgen independent (LNCaP-abl and LNCaP-abl-Hof) prostate cancer cell lines. Here we have applied technically robust and reproducible label-free liquid chromatography mass spectrometry analysis for comprehensive proteomic profiling of prostate cancer cell lines under hypoxic conditions. This led to the identification of over 4,000 proteins â€“ one of the largest protein datasets for prostate cancer cell lines established to date. The biological and clinical significance of proteins showing a significant change in expression as result of hypoxic conditions was established. Novel, intuitive workflows were subsequently implemented to enable robust, reproducible and high throughput verification of selected proteins of interest. Overall, these data suggest that this strategy supports identification of protein biomarkers of prostate cancer progression and potential therapeutic targets for CRPC.
