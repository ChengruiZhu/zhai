Using these methods, the researchers found that in 2009, there were 930 female homicides compared to 1,052 in 1999, giving an overall female homicide rate per 100,000 women of 12.9 in 2009 compared to 24.7 in 1999. There was a statistically significant decrease in the rate of non-intimate femicide, with a rate of 8.6 per 100,000 women in 1999 compared to 4.2 in 2009. Although there was some evidence of a decrease in the rate of intimate partner femicide—8.8 per 100,000 women in 1999 compared to 5.6 in 2009—this decrease was not statistically significant. The researchers also found that there was a significant decrease in the rate of fatal shootings (female gun homicides), 7.5 per 100,000 women in 1999 compared to 2.5 in 2009, and that this finding was similar for homicides perpetrated by partners and non-partners (intimate and non-intimate gun homicides). Finally, the researchers found that the overall rate of fatal rapes (female rape homicides) was 3.4 per 100,000 women in 1999 compared to 2.5 in 2009, but again, this difference was not statistically significant. Unfortunately, the researchers found that the odds (chance) of conviction of perpetrators of intimate femicide was unchanged between the two time points (1.11), and the odds of conviction of perpetrators of non-intimate femicides had significantly decreased (0.32).
