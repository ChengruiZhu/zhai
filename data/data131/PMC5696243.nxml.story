Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-α (PPAR-α), a lipid activated transcription factor of nuclear hormone receptor superfamily, can relieve pain through a rapid-response mechanism. However, little is known about the underlying mechanism. Herein, we report that PPAR-α activation acutely inhibits the functional activity of acid-sensing ion channels (ASICs), key sensors for extracellular protons, in rat dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons. Pre-application of PPAR-α agonist GW7647 for 2 min decreased the amplitude of proton-gated currents mediated by ASICs in a concentration-dependent manner. GW7647 shifted the concentration-response curve for proton downwards, with a decrease of 36.9 ± 2.3% in the maximal current response to proton. GW7647 inhibition of proton-gated currents can be blocked by GW6471, a selective PPAR-α antagonist. Moreover, PPAR-α activation decreased the number of acidosis-evoked action potentials in rat DRG neurons. Finally, peripheral administration of GW7647 dose-dependently relieved nociceptive responses to injection of acetic acid in rats. These results indicated that activation of peripheral PPAR-α acutely inhibited functional activity of ASICs in a non-genomic manner, which revealed a novel mechanism underlying rapid analgesia through peripheral PPAR-α.
