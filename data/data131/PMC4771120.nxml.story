 after small interfering RNA (siRNA) transfection to Jurkat cells. The HOXA5-specific siRNA was transfected to Jurkat cells using lipofectamine. The experiment was divided into the experimental group (liposomal transfection of HOXA5 targeting siRNA), the negative control group (liposomal transfection of cells with negative control siRNA) and the control group (plus an equal amount of cells and culture media only). Western blotting and quantitative fluorescent polymerase chain reaction (QF-PCR) were used to detect the relative HOXA5 mRNA expression and protein distribution in each cell group. Cell distribution in the cell cycle and the rate of cells undergoing apoptosis were determined using flow cytometry. The expression of HOXA5 at the mRNA and protein levels in the acute phase of ALL was significantly higher than that in ALL in the remission and control groups. In cells transfected with HOXA5-specific siRNA, the expression of HOXA5 at the mRNA and protein levels decreased significantly (P<0.05). The distribution of cells in the cell cycle was also altered. Specifically, more cells were present in the G0/G1 phase compared to the S phase (P<0.05). In addition, the apoptotic rate was significantly higher in cells transfected with HOXA5-specific siRNA (P<0.05). In conclusion, high expression levels of HOXA5 mRNA and protein in children with ALL indicate that HOXA5 is closely associated with childhood ALL. In addition, HOXA5-specific siRNA effectively silences HOXA5 gene expression and induces apoptosis and cell-cycle arrest in Jurkat cells, thus inhibiting cell proliferation.
