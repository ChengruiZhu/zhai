3-Phosphoglycerate kinase (PGK) is an essential enzyme for living organisms. It catalyzes the phospho-transfer reaction between two catabolites during carbohydrate metabolism. In addition to this physiological role, human PGK has been shown to phosphorylate L-nucleoside analogues, potential drugs against viral infection and cancer. PGK is a two domain enzyme, with the two substrates bound to the two separate domains. In order to perform its function the enzyme has to undergo a large conformational change involving a hinge bending to bring the substrates into close proximity. The allosteric pathway from the open non-reactive state of PGK to the closed reactive state as triggered by substrate binding has only been partially uncovered by experimental studies. Here we describe a complete allosteric pathway, which connects the substrate binding sites to the interdomain hinge region using Molecular Dynamics simulations combined with Force Distribution Analysis (FDA). While previously identified key residues involved in PGK domain closure are part of this pathway, we here fill the numerous gaps in the pathway by identifying newly uncovered residues and interesting candidates for future mutational studies.
