The shape of animal cells is largely determined by the organization of their internal structural elements, including the filamentous structures of their cytoskeleton. Motile cells that crawl across solid substrates must assemble their cytoskeletal actin filaments in a spatially organized way, such that net filament growth and cell protrusion occur at the front of the cell. Actin filament dynamics, in turn, influence the overall shape of the cell by pushing on the plasma membrane. In this work, we have explored the ways that variations in small-scale actin filament growth dynamics are coupled to large-scale changes in cell shape and behavior. By manipulating the availability of a family of actin-binding proteins (Ena/VASP) that regulate actin filament growth, we can alter the overall cell shape and motile behavior of epithelial fish keratocytesâ€”unusually fast-moving and regularly shaped cells. We have also found that unperturbed keratocytes in a population exhibit a continuum of shape and behavioral variations that can be correlated with differences in Ena/VASP levels. We have developed a mathematical model that allows us to explain our observations of intrinsic cell-to-cell shape variation, motile behavior, and cell responses to molecular perturbations as a function of actin filament growth dynamics in motile cells.
