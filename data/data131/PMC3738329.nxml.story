Blood pressure control and prevention of hypertension can be achieved by both pharmacological and lifestyle interventions; one important lifestyle intervention is physical activity. Participation in regular physical activity can modestly lower blood pressure by reducing total peripheral resistance; it can also reduce the risk of developing hypertension and improve morbidity and mortality outcomes. Therefore, physical activity is a recommended intervention for the majority of hypertensive or prehypertensive patients. The precise level of physical activity required to lower blood pressure is unknown; however, in the UK, national minimum physical activity guidelines would seem appropriate for most hypertensives. Current patient physical activity levels can be assessed easily using retrospective recall questionnaires; preparticipation screening and exercise modifications for high-risk patients may reduce the risk of adverse events during subsequent exercise; and identification of a patient's willingness to increase physical activity levels may help to tailor physical activity advice. Health professional counselling or advice on physical activity is currently the most effective researched intervention. Its success can be maximized by delivering physical activity advice and counselling multiple times using different health professionals in person or over the telephone and by offering additional written materials. While the most effective methods for increasing physical activity levels in patients are probably still unclear, physical activity is an advisable intervention for the majority of hypertensive patients.
