Mitochondrial DNA encodes essential components of the mitochondrial respiratory chain and is strictly maternally inherited, making it vulnerable to the accumulation of deleterious mutations. To avoid this, mtDNA is subjected to a bottleneck phenomenon whereby only a small number of mtDNA molecules are passed on to the oocyte precursor. These are then amplified to the required number of mtDNA molecules in the mature oocyte, meaning that any mutations may be either lost or rapidly fixed. Purifying selection is thought to be an important protective mechanism against pathogenic mtDNA mutations in the germline, as this is essential for mtDNA stability. It is unknown whether there are any such protective mechanisms in the somatic tissues. To investigate this we have compared the spectrum of mutations present in ageing human colonocytes with those population variants passed through the maternal germline and mtDNA mutations responsible for primary mtDNA disease. We show that pathogenic mtDNA mutations are present at a significantly higher frequency in the somatic cells of the human colon in contrast to variants that have passed though the germline, showing little evidence for purifying selection in the somatic tissues studied here, but strong evidence of this selective mechanism in the germline.
