A total of 2,322 articles were retrieved by the initial search. Of these, 37 were selected for full review, comprising 24 RCTs (OCEBM Level 1 evidence: 4 reports of fully double-blinded or blinded with respect to the PI component). The remaining 20 RCTs and 13 observational studies qualified as OCEBM Level 2 evidence. Level 1 evidence showed initial but non-progressive increases in serum creatinine and corresponding decreases in estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), suggesting an effect on renal tubular transport of creatinine. Level 2 evidence suggested that atazanavir and lopinavir especially in combination with TDF were associated with non-progressive reductions in eGFR over time, with a decreased risk for the development of chronic kidney disease (CKD) on cessation and without the development of advanced CKD or end-stage renal disease (ESRD); whether these reductions were independent or associated with interactions with coadministered TDF could not be established with certainty. Data on darunavir were insufficient to draw any conclusions. The principal limitation of the reviewed studies was the lack of standardization of creatinine measurements in virtually all studies and the lack of corroborative data on changes in proteinuria or other indices of renal function.
