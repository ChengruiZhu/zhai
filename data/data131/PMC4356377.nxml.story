Lung cancer is a common malignant neoplasm that is prone to distant metastasis. However, the incidence of multiple cutaneous and intestinal metastases is rare. The present study describes the case of a 62-year-old female who was admitted to The Affiliated Hospital of Shandong Academy of Medical Sciences in August 2013 with multiple cutaneous lumps. Contrast-enhanced computed tomography showed nodules and masses in the right lung, and multiple enlarged lymph nodes in the mediastinum and right hilum. Biopsies of the lumps in the right lung and skin revealed moderately-differentiated adenocarcinoma, which were considered to be cutaneous metastases of lung cancer. The patient subsequently experienced symptoms of rectal irritation. A digital rectal examination and colonoscopy were performed, and the consequent pathological biopsy identified moderately-differentiated adenocarcinoma. After analyzing the results of previous pathological examinations and immunohistochemistry, it may be suggested that intestinal metastasis had developed. This case highlights the fact that a comprehensive analysis and examination should be performed for suspected cutaneous and intestinal lesions, during which, a pathological biopsy is of great importance in order to form the correct diagnosis for timely treatment.
