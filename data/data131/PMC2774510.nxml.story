Although TEs are a major component of all studied plant genomes, and are the most significant contributors to genome structure and evolution in almost all eukaryotes that have been investigated, their properties and reasons for existence are not well understood in any eukaryotic genome. In order to begin a comprehensive study of TE contributions to the structure, function, and evolution of both genes and genomes, we first identified all of the TEs in maize and then investigated whether there were non-random patterns in their dispersal. We used homology and TE structure criteria in an effort to discover all of the retroelements in the recently sequenced genome from maize inbred B73. We found that the retroelements are incredibly diverse in maize, with many hundreds of families that show different insertion and/or retention specificities across the maize chromosomes. Most of these element families are present in low copy numbers and had been missed by previous searches that relied on a high-copy-number criterion. Different element families exhibited very different biases for accumulation across the chromosomes, indicating that they can detect and utilize many different chromatin environments.
