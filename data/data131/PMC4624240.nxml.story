The studyâ€™s reliance on caregiver reports of illnesses among young children and potential unmeasured differences between areas with intermittent versus continuous supply may affect the accuracy of these findings. Nevertheless, the study data suggest that these sources of bias are unlikely. These findings suggest that, compared to having an intermittent water supply, having a continuous water supply was not associated with diarrheal disease or growth (judged by weight) among children aged < 5 y in Hubli-Dharwad. That is, having a continuous piped water supply was not associated with a reduction in waterborne diseases overall among young children in this setting. This finding could reflect contamination of water during continued water storage in households with a continuous supply (it takes time to change old habits) and/or exposure to organisms (pathogens) that cause diarrhea through nonwaterborne routes. Importantly, however, the finding that a continuous supply was associated with a reduction in typhoid fever and more severe forms of waterborne illness among children in lower-income households suggests that intermittently operated water systems can serve as a transmission route for waterborne pathogens in urban populations despite centralized treatment of water to make it safe to drink.
