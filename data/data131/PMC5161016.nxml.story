Bladder neck (BN) dissection is considered one of the most challenging steps during robot-assisted radical prostatectomy. Better understanding of the BN anatomy, coupled with a standardized approach may facilitate dissection while minimizing complications. We describe in this article the 4 anatomic spaces during standardized BN dissection, as well other technical maneuvers of managing difficult scenarios including treatment of a large median lobe or patients with previous transurethral resection of the prostate. The first step involves the proper identification of the BN followed by slow horizontal dissection of the first layer (the dorsal venous complex and perivesicle fat). The second step proceeds with reconfirming the location of the BN followed by midline dissection of the second anatomical layer (the anterior bladder muscle and mucosa) using the tip of the monopolar scissor until the catheter is identified. The deflated catheter is then grasped by the assistant to apply upward traction on the prostate from 2 directions along with downward traction on the posterior bladder wall by the tip of the suction instrument. This triangulation allows easier, and safer visual, layer by layer, dissection of the third BN layer (the posterior bladder mucosa and muscle wall). The forth step is next performed by blunt puncture of the fourth layer (the retrotrigonal fascia) aiming to enter into the previously dissected seminal vesical space. Finally, both vas deferens and seminal vesicles are pulled through the open BN and handed to the assistant for upper traction to initiate Denovillier's dissection and prostate pedicle/neurovascular bundle control.
