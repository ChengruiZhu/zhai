Hepatectomy without portal triad clamping may decrease the incidence of liver injury; however, the effects of hepatectomy without portal triad clamping in the treatment of spontaneous rupture of hepatocellular carcinoma (SRHCC) remain unclear. The aims of the present study were to evaluate the therapeutic value of hepatectomy without portal triad clamping in the treatment of patients with SRHCC. The present study retrospectively reviewed patients with SRHCC who received hepatectomy without portal triad clamping (non-clamping group) and the therapeutic efficacy was compared with that of 20 patients with SRHCC undergoing the same surgery in the presence of portal triad clamping (clamping group). Following hepatectomy, the non-clamping group exhibited a significantly lower incidence of acute liver failure compared with the clamping group (P<0.05). No significant differences in operative time, intra-operative blood loss, disease-free or overall survival times between the two groups were identified (all P>0.05). At 1 week and 2 weeks after surgery, the non-clamping group exhibited significantly lower alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase and total bilirubin serum levels compared with the clamping group (all P<0.05). Hepatectomy without portal triad clamping may decrease the incidence of liver injury and liver failure in patients with SRHCC, suggesting that it may be a safe and effective therapeutic strategy.
