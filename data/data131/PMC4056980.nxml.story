Over the past years there has been a significant decrease in mortality and morbidity in patients suffering from severe burns due to improved burn wound management and approaches in critical care. Survival is no longer the exception, but unfortunately death still occurs. One of the key elements concerning state-of-the-art burn care is blood glucose control and insulin therapy; it is well known that burn-induced hyperglycaemia is associated with adverse clinical outcomes. However, controversy for insulin therapy and tight glycaemic control in critically ill and burn patients exists. The increased incidence of hypoglycaemia is the dominant argument against this treatment, because hypoglycaemia is also associated with an increased risk for death in critically ill patients. Taking all current data together, insulin therapy appears both a friend and a foe in the treatment of ICU patients. In order to overcome the limits of tight glycaemic control resulting from hypoglycaemic episodes, current efforts have been directed towards the development of protocols allowing for implementation of clinically feasible and safe guidelines. Among the strategies addressing this problem are closed loop techniques, which are supported by studies demonstrating their capability of exerting tight glycaemic control without the risk of developing hypoglycaemic episodes. Although closed loop techniques have become readily available, we require further evidence to ensure their safety in various ICU environments, notably in ICUs dealing with burn patients. Nonetheless, it is important to emphasise that glycaemic control and adequate insulin therapy are crucial factors for the final outcome (survival) and require our attention.
