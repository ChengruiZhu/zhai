 transmission model consists of “compartments” through which individuals pass as they become infected with parasites, develop immunity, become infectious to mosquitoes, and so on. The researchers used published data about parasite prevalence (the proportion of the population infected with parasites) and about relevant aspects of mosquito, parasite, and human biology, to estimate the chances of an individual moving between compartments. Finally, they used the model to explore the impact over 25 years of increased coverage of LLINs, IRS, and MSAT, and of a future vaccine on malaria transmission in six representative African settings. In a low-transmission setting, 80% coverage with LLINs reduced the parasite prevalence to below 1% in all age groups. In two moderate-transmission settings, LLIN scale-up alone failed to reach this target but the addition of IRS and MSAT drove the parasite prevalence below 1%. However, this combination of interventions did not control malaria in a moderate-transmission setting in which a mosquito species that bites and rests outside houses contributes to malaria transmission. Finally, in two high-transmission settings, parasite prevalence could be driven below 1% only by setting unrealistic coverage targets for existing interventions.
