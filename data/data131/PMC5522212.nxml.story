Radioresistance remains a major problem in the treatment of patients with hypopharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma (HSCC). Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) have important roles in the development, invasion, and metastasis of various tumors, including HSCC, but little is known about the role of lncRNAs in cancer radioresistance. The aim of this study was to identify radioresistance-related lncRNAs and mRNAs in radioresistant (RS) hypopharyngeal cancer subclone RS-FaDu cells. In this study, we performed microarray analysis to find the differences in time-course lncRNA and mRNA expression profiles between RS-FaDu and parent FaDu cells after 4 Gy radiation therapy, whose reliability was confirmed by validation experiment. Among these consistently dysregulated lncRNAs, we found that some lncRNAs (e.g., TCONS_00018436) might control resistance of HSCC cells to radiation. Furthermore, our bioinformatics analyses from mRNA/lncRNA microarray data showed that certain lncRNAs or mRNAs potentially are involved in radioresistance of HSCC. Our results from this study laid the foundation for further investigating the roles of these lncRNAs and mRNAs as promising candidates in the occurrence and development of HSCC radioresistance.
