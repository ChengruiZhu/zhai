Postinfectious meningoencephalitis was suspected in 14 (15.6%) patients, and 56 (62.2%) had unknown etiology. Elevated CSF WBC was present in 77 patients (mean of 169.3 ± 279.4/mm3) and all but 6 had elevated CSF proteins (1.23 ± 0.88 g/L). Convulsions occurred more frequently in HSV-1 (37.5%) and in unknown etiology group (15.7%). GOS<3 was noted in 50% of HSV, 33% of VZV, 25% of TBE and 24% of unknown group patients during hospitalization. Mechanical ventilation was necessary in 17.1% of patients with unknown and 23.5% with viral etiology for the mean duration of 1.8 ± 6.7 and 3.2 ± 6.3 days, respectively. The mean length of stay was 23.2 ± 18.5 days. In-hospital mortality was 7.8%. Among 64 survivors who were available for follow-up interviews (mean follow-up of 28.6 ± 6.8 months), 73.1% with unknown and 90.9% with viral etiology had favorable outcomes (mRS 0–1); 4 (6.25%) had moderate (mRS 3) and 3 (4.6%) had severe neuropsychological deficits (mRS 4-5).
