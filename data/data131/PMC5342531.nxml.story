This study aimed to elucidate the mechanisms underlying the resistance of breast cancer to eribulin. Seven eribulin-resistant breast cancer cell lines (MCF7/E, BT474/E, ZR75-1/E, SKBR3/E, MDA-MB-231/E, Hs578T/E, and MDA-MB-157/E) were established. mRNA and protein expression of ATP-binding cassette subfamily B member 1 (ABCB1) and subfamily C member 11 (ABCC11) increased in all eribulin-resistant cell lines compared to the parental cell lines. When ABCB1 or ABCC11 expression was inhibited by small interfering RNA in MCF7/E, BT474/E, and MDA-MB-231/E cells, eribulin sensitivity was partially restored. Moreover, eribulin resistance was attenuated additively by inhibiting ABCB1 and ABCC11 in MCF7/E cells. Additionally, overexpression of exogenous ABCB1 or ABCC11 in HEK293T cells conferred resistance to eribulin. MCF7/E and MDA-MB-231/E cells showed cross-resistance to paclitaxel, doxorubicin, and fluorouracil. Inhibition of ABCB1 partially restored paclitaxel and doxorubicin sensitivity. Partial restoration of fluorouracil sensitivity was induced by inhibiting ABCC11 in MCF7/E and MDA-MB-231/E cells. Both ABCB1 and ABCC11 are involved in the development of eribulin resistance in breast cancer cells
