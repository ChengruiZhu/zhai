Sociogenomics explores the relationship between social behavior and the genome. An important issue is the extent to which results from social insects can be used to understand social behavior in other animals. We address this question through computational studies of previously published experimental data on patterns of brain gene expression in honey bees in response to particular environmental conditions and stimuli. We found that for one particular stimulus, response to alarm pheromone, the set of honey bee genes differentially expressed in the brain contains disproportionately large numbers of genes also found in mammals, including humans. This enrichment in orthologous genes suggests surprisingly strong similarities in socially responsive genetic circuits common to honey bees and mammals. A large number of the human counterparts of these genes are important for regulating protein folding, protein metabolism, and regulation of protein complex formation, perhaps reflecting changes in macromolecular complexes involved in remodeling critical neural circuits in response to the alarm pheromone. Noting that alarm pheromone is a component of the honey beeâ€™s communication system, we hypothesize that such rapid remodeling may be an adaptation in the brain cells of social animals to deal with the complex patterns of conspecific signaling essential for social organization.
