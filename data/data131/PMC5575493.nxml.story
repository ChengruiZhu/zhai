Previously, a significantly upregulated lncRNA, LINC01512, in lung adenocarcinoma (LAD) was obtained, while its biological function and molecular mechanisms were unclear. The expression level of LINC01512 was estimated by qPCR from 100 pairs of LAD and NT samples. The correlation of LINC01512 to clinical data of LAD patients was analyzed. LINC01512 was knocked down and overexpressed in SPCA‐1 and A549 cell lines by lentivirus‐mediated technology, and the oncological behavioral changes of SPCA‐1 and A549 cells were observed, as well as, tumorigenicity in experimental nude mice. Compared to the adjacent tissues, LINC01512 was obviously upregulated in LAD. The expression level of LINC01512 was closely related to lymph node metastasis and tumor node metastasis (TNM) stage. Survival analysis showed that the survival time of high expression LINC01512 group was significantly shorter than the low‐expression group in LAD. Knockdown or overexpression test unanimously confirmed that LINC01512 can increase the ability of cell migration, invasion, proliferation, colony formation, adhesion, and S phase and G2/M phase cells, whereas decrease the apoptosis and G0/G1 phase cells. Nude mice experiments confirmed that LINC01512 significantly enhanced the speed and weight of tumorigenicity. LINC01512 is an oncogenic lncRNA gene that promotes the progression and distinctly enhances the oncogenic ability in lung adenocarcinoma. J. Cell. Biochem. 118: 3102–3110, 2017. © 2017 The Authors.
