A critical component of successful reproduction is ensuring that the correct number of chromosomes is distributed to the gametes (i.e. sperm, eggs). Incorrect numbers of chromosomes in our gametes can directly result in infertility, miscarriages and developmental disabilities such as Down syndrome. Gamete production involves meiosis, in which crossovers between parental chromosomes are required to promote proper chromosome segregation. However, other types of recombination can occur that are not productive towards appropriate chromosome segregation. In this study, we examine several genes that are thought to play important roles in crossover (CO) promotion. By interpreting the final recombination products using a sequencing based analysis of all four gametes of an individual meiosis in budding yeast, we can infer the roles of these genes in recombination. We find that one protein, Zip3, can direct biased cleavage of the dHJ intermediate but another protein, Msh4, in the same complex cannot. Moreover, we find that a minor resolvase, Mus81/Mms4 (Eme1) is crucial in limiting chromosome entanglements by suppressing multiple consecutive recombination events from initiating from a single double-strand break (DSB). We favor a model that Mms4 is needed to remove a 3â€²-flap such that second-end capture of the DSB can occur.
