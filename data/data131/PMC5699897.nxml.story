We evaluated whether comprehensive cardiac rehabilitation (CR) in patients with cardiovascular disease (CVD) could improve various hemodynamic parameters obtained using simple non-invasive tests. We analyzed 48 CVD patients with (n = 38, CR group) or without (n = 10, non-CR group) a CR program, and prospectively followed them for 12 months. Various parameters were measured at baseline and after 12 months using 3 simple non-invasive tests: blood pressure (BP) and severity of atherosclerosis [arterial velocity pulse index (AVI) and atrial pressure volume index] were determined using PASESA®, an index of total autonomic nerve activity and a coefficient of variation of the R-R interval (CVRR) were determined using eHEART®, and the total peripheral resistance, stroke volume and cardiac index (CI) were determined using nico®. The main hemodynamic parameters did not change between baseline and 12 months in both groups. Patients in the CR group were divided into higher (H-) and lower (L-) systolic BP (SBP) or AVI according to the average value of SBP or AVI at baseline in the CR group. Patients with H-SBP or H-AVI in the CR group showed a significant reduction of SBP or AVI at 12 months. In addition, patients in the CR group were divided into H- and L- CI or CVRR according to the average value of CI or CVRR at baseline in the CR group. Patients with L-CI or L-CVRR in the CR group significantly improved after 12 months. In conclusion, CR may lead various hemodynamic parameters obtained using simple non-invasive tests to their appropriate levels.
