A total of 40 male SD rats were equally and randomly divided into four groups: blank group, model group, and two treatment groups (A and B). Rats were subcutaneously injected with carrageenan to induce thrombosis. Rats in the treatment group A were intragastrically administered with Huisheng Oral Solution at a dose of 2 ml/100 g body weight (once per 8 hours), 72 hours after carrageenan injection, while those in the treatment group B were administered with Huisheng Oral Solution both 72 hours before and after induction of thrombosis. Blood samples were collected 24, 48, and 72 hours after carrageenan injection for measurements of prothrombin time (PT), activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT), international normalized ratio (INR), fibrinogen (FIB), prothrombin activity (PTA), platelets (PLT), fibrin degradation products (FDPs), and D-dimer. Lung, liver, and mesentery samples were taken 72 hours after carrageenan injection for histopathological analysis. The numbers of microthrombi in sections of different tissue samples were counted under a microscope. Blood parameters among each group were compared using the Welch test, the Kruskal-Wallis test, or the SNK test after testing for normality, while the number of microthrombi was compared using the Bonferroni test.
