Episodic memories relate positive or negative experiences to environmental context. The neurophysiological mechanisms of this connection, however, remain unknown. Hippocampal place cells represent location, but it is unclear if they encode only the spatial representation of the environment or if they are also processing information about the reward valence for different locations. Here, we use population analysis to test the hypothesis that the place cells process the dual encoding of spatial representation and experience-dependent reward expectation. We show a unique population code for the experience-dependent value of the context. We present evidence that the accumulation of the place fields mediates the learning of the reward context of the environment. Our data reveal that the causal link between place field distribution and behavioral place preference is mediated by the tegmental dopaminergic activity. Optogenetic control of the ventral tegmental area demonstrates that dopaminergic signaling integrates the encoding of location and reward from hippocampal neurons. These findings shed a new light on the ability of hippocampal neurons to store the experience-dependent context reward value, enabling episodic memory for past experience to support future adaptive behavior.
