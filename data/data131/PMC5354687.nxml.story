The aim of our study was to evaluate the effect of continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) on serum cytokines, neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL), and prognosis in patients with severe acute kidney injury (AKI) following cardiac surgery. A total number of 153 patients with severe AKI following cardiac surgery were treated with CRRT. They were divided into the survival and non-survival groups. Clinical data from these two groups before and after CRRT were recorded and analyzed. It was found that the number of impaired organs, MODS and APACHE II scores were significantly higher in the non-survival group than those in the survival group before CRRT. After CRRT, MODS and APACHE II scores decreased significantly. The post-CRRT levels of serum TNF-a and IL-6 were significantly decreased. After CRRT, serum NGAL decreased in the two groups, but the levels were higher in the non-survival group than those in the survival group. MODS and APACHE II scores could be used to evaluate the severity of AKI in patients after cardiac surgery. CRRT is an effective treatment for these patients and high levels of TNF-a, IL-6, and NGAL are associated with a poor prognosis in these patients.
