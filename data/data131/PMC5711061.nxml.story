The purpose of this study was to develop and evaluate a noninvasive method to assess table feed speed (mm's) in modern commercial computed tomography (CT) systems. The table feed (mm/rotation) was measured at selected nominal table feed speeds, given as low (26.67 mm/s), intermediate (48.00 mm/s), and high (64.00 mm/s), by utilizing a computed radiography (CR) cassette installed with a photostimulable phosphor plate. The cassette was placed on the examination table to travel through the isocenter longitudinally, with a total scan length of over 430 mm. The distance travelled was employed to determine the total table feed length. To calculate the table feed speed, gantry rotation time was measured concurrently at a preselected nominal rotation time of 750 ms. Upon completion of data acquisition, the table feed and gantry rotation time were analyzed and used to calculate the actual table feed speed (mm/s). Under the low table feed speed setting, the table feed speed was found to be 26.67 mm/s. Similarly, under the intermediate and high table feed speed settings, the table feed speed was found to be 48.10 and 64.07 mm/s, respectively. Measurements of the table feed speed can be accomplished with a CR system and solid‚Äêstate detector, and the table feed speed results were in excellent agreement with the nominal preset values.
