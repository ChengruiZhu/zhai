Dendritic cells (DCs) are critical for the initiation of immune responses including activation of CD8 T cells. Intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels influence DC maturation and function. Intracellular heme, a product of catabolism of heme-containing metalloproteins, is a key inducer of ROS. Intracellular heme levels are regulated by heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1), which catalyzes the degradation of heme. Heme oxygenase-1 has been implicated in regulating DC maturation; however, its role in other DC functions is unclear. Furthermore, the signaling pathways modulated by HO-1 in DCs are unknown. In this study, we demonstrate that inhibition of HO-1 activity in murine bone marrow-derived immature DCs (iDCs) resulted in DCs with raised intracellular ROS levels, a mature phenotype, impaired phagocytic and endocytic function, and increased capacity to stimulate antigen-specific CD8 T cells. Interestingly, our results reveal that the increased ROS levels following HO-1 inhibition did not underlie the changes in phenotype and functions observed in these iDCs. Importantly, we show that the p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (p38 MAPK), cAMP-responsive element binding protein (CREB), and activating transcription factor 1 (ATF1) pathway is involved in the mediation of the phenotypic and functional changes arising from HO-1 inhibition. Furthermore, up-regulation of HO-1 activity rendered iDCs refractory to lipopolysaccharide-induced activation of p38 MAPK-CREB/ATF1 pathway and DC maturation. Finally, we demonstrate that treatment of iDC with the HO-1 substrate, heme, recapitulates the effects that result from HO-1 inhibition. Based on these results, we conclude that HO-1 regulates DC maturation and function by modulating the p38 MAPK-CREB/ATF1 signaling axis.
