-value >0.05 to obtain the differentially expressed mRNAs, miRNAs and lncRNAs. Hereafter, weighted gene co-expression network analysis was performed to identify the expression characteristics of dysregulated genes. We obtained five co-expression modules and related clinical feature. By means of correlating gene modules with proteinâ€“protein interaction network analysis that had identified 22 hub mRNAs which could as hub target genes. Eleven key dysregulated differentially expressed micro RNAs (DEmiRNAs) were identified that were significantly associated with the 22 hub potential target genes. Moreover, we found that 14 key differentially expressed lncRNAs could interact with the key DEmiRNAs. Then, the ceRNA crosstalk network of TNBC was constructed by utilizing key lncRNAs, key miRNAs, and hub mRNAs in Cytoscape software. We analyzed and described the potential characteristics of biological function and pathological roles of the TNBC ceRNA co-regulatory network; also, the survival analysis was performed for each molecule. These findings revealed that ceRNA crosstalk network could play an important role in the development and progression for TNBC. In addition, we also identified that some molecules in the ceRNA network possess clinical correlation and prognosis.
