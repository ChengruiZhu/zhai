 (Ir).The root was deemed to have analgesic and anti-inflammatory effects, and no report has been published about the liver-protective activity against hepatic I/R. Therefore, the present study was aimed to understand the therapeutic impact of Ir in hepatic I/R injury. Male albino, Wistar strain rats were used and were grouped into four total phenolic content, free radical scavenging activity and serum enzymes were determined. Histopathological and immunohistochemical analysis were also carried out. Inflammatory cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) and interleukin (IL-6) and protein expression of p53, bax, and bcl-2 were determined. The administration of extracts of Ir significantly increased total phenolic and free radical scavenging activity. Altered cellular morphology, cytokines and aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) were returned to near normal level. IL-6 and TNF-α levels were reduced more than 25% following treatment. Also, the protein expression of p53, bax, and bcl-2 were also returned to near normal level. Taking all these data together, it is suggested that the extracts of Ir may be a potential therapeutic agent for providing several beneficial effects in hepatic I/R injury.
