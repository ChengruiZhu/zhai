Bone disorders are a group of varied acute and chronic traumatic, degenerative, malignant or congenital conditions affecting the musculoskeletal system. They are prevalent in society and, with an ageing population, the incidence and impact on the populationâ€™s health is growing. Severe persisting pain and limited mobility are the major symptoms of the disorder that impair the quality of life in affected patients. Current therapies only partially treat the disorders, offering management of symptoms, or temporary replacement with inert materials. However, during the last few years, the options for the treatment of bone disorders have greatly expanded, thanks to the advent of regenerative medicine. Skeletal cell-based regeneration medicine offers promising reparative therapies for patients. Mesenchymal stem (stromal) cells from different tissues have been gradually translated into clinical practice; however, there are a number of limitations. The introduction of reprogramming methods and the subsequent production of induced pluripotent stem cells provides a possibility to create human-specific models of bone disorders. Furthermore, human-induced pluripotent stem cell-based autologous transplantation is considered to be future breakthrough in the field of regenerative medicine. The main goal of the present paper is to review recent applications of induced pluripotent stem cells in bone disease modeling and to discuss possible future therapy options. The present article contributes to the dissemination of scientific and pre-clinical results between physicians, mainly orthopedist and thus supports the translation to clinical practice.
