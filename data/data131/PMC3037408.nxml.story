DNA trinucleotide repeats are naturally occurring runs of three base-pairs. Genetic mutations that expand (lengthen) triplet repeats cause multiple neurological diseases, including Huntington's disease. Triplet repeats also contract (shorten) and break. This complex behavior suggests triplet repeats are problematic for DNA replication and repair enzymes. Here, we identified a cellular factor called Ctf18-RFC that helps yeast cells accurately replicate triplet repeats. We found that mutants lacking Ctf18-RFC show enhanced levels of expansions, contractions, and fragility over a wide range of triplet repeat lengths. Other labs showed that Ctf18-RFC helps replicated chromosomes stay together until mitosis, a process called sister chromatid cohesion. However, we found that Ctf18-RFC stabilizes triplet repeats in a different way, by helping the DNA replication machinery move through triplet repeats and by helping repair any resulting DNA damage. Another insight is that Ctf18-RFC provides these functions at other sites besides triplet repeats, but the presence of a triplet repeat makes the yeast cell especially dependent on Ctf18-RFC to prevent DNA damage and allow normal cell cycle progression. Our results implicate Ctf18-RFC as a new player in the triplet repeat story and indicate that it functions through novel roles to preserve genome integrity.
