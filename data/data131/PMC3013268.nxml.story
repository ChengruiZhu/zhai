 (STEC) strains among children in two randomly-selected populations in Iran. In total, 1,292 randomly-selected faecal samples from children aged less than 10 years were screened for EPEC and STEC. Of the 1,292 cases participated in the study, 184 had diarrhoea, and 1,108 were healthy/asymptomatic children. The conventional culture method and slide agglutination with 12 different commercial EPEC antisera were used for the detection of EPEC. The colony sweep polymyxin-B extraction method, non-sorbitol fermentation (NSF) phenotype, and slide agglutination with O157:H7 antisera were used for the screening and detection of STEC. Of EPEC belonging to 11 different serogroups, O111 and O127 were most commonly found in 36.4% of the diarrhoeal cases and 7.2% of the asymptomatic children. A significant association (p<0.05) was found between isolation of EPEC and diarrhoea. 8.7% of the diarrhoeal cases and 2% of children without diarrhoea were infected with STEC, but none of the isolates belonged to the O157:H7 serotype. A significant association (p<0.05) was found between STEC and diarrhoeal cases. Based on these findings, it can be concluded that different EPEC serogroups may be agents of endemic infantile diarrhoea, and STEC strains are an important enteropathogen among young children.
