40 female, 9 male patients inclueded with avarage age, BMI, follow-up time is 60, 34.6, 30 months. OKS, KSS, fKSS, ROM improved significantly from 12.7, 43.3, 34.8,111º preoperatively to 37.8, 85.7, 82, 123º postoperatively. VAS decreased from 9 to 2.6. Not significant differences was found between the age and patellofemaral arthrosis groups. Postop VAS scores were high, knee scores were significantly low at morbid obeses while other BMI groups got perfect knee scores. Knee scores are significantly low, VAS scores are high at patients with femoral component varus is 10º, greater than 10 º, postop TPA is smaller than 85º, higher than 90º. Most frequent mistake was sagittal plane positioning of femoral component. Lateral positioning and more than 10º varus-valgus of tibial component, abnormal PTS, more than 10º varus-valgus of femoral component are the most frequent mistakes of revised knees. All revised cases were in the group that operated at first two years of surgical experience. Postop PTS, TPA, morbid obesity are the most significant factors which affect upcoming revision. Revision ratio is 11.5%. Acccording to Kaplan-Meier survival analysis; 1, 2, 3, 4 years survivorship without any infirmity are 93.7%, 91.5%, 91.5%, 85.7% respectivly.
