The ability of a tumor to invade into the surrounding normal tissue is one hallmark of a malignant cancer. We sought to identify factors that either restrict or promote tumor invasion in a genetically engineered mouse model of pancreatic neuroendocrine cancer by characterizing the transcriptional profiles of the non-invasive and invasive pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (PNET) that develop in this model. This analysis demonstrated that multiple genes encoding components of desmosomes, cellular structures dedicated to the maintenance of cell-cell adhesion, were expressed at much lower levels in invasive PNETs, suggesting that loss of desmosomal adhesion contributes to the development of an invasive phenotype in these tumors. Genetic deletion of one of these desmosomal components in PNET-bearing mice resulted in increased local tumor invasion. These results are important since the development of an invasive phenotype is associated with a poor prognosis for many human cancers and is often a precursor to the development of distant metastases. Our findings demonstrate one mechanism by which tumors can acquire such an invasive phenotype and may prove useful in evaluating the malignancy of human cancers.
