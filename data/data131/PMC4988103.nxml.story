Clinically 17/30 (56.7%) (11 of the LRS and 5 of the DCM) were decompensated. Significant shunt was present in 15/19 (78.9%) in LRS. Systolic dysfunction was presented in 5/30 (16.7%) cases (4 patients were DCM and one case was LRS). Two types of diastolic dysfunction, impaired relaxation in 5/22 (22.7%) patients and restrictive-like filling pattern in 5/16 (31.2 %) were observed. The NT-Pro BNP level was significantly elevated 11 and 16 times in the LRS and DCM groups respectively. Negative significant correlations were observed between the levels of NT-ProBNP and the following echo variables; EDD, LAD, E wave and E/A ratio in the LRS patients. Positive significant correlations were observed between the levels of NT-ProBNP and the following echo variables; PAP and QP/QS in the LRS. Both the PAP and QP/QS were higher in the elevated NT-Pro BNP group compared to the normal level group. The NT-Pro BNP level was elevated in all 17/30 (56.7%) decompensated patients (11 were LRS, 6 were DCM) (P = 0.002). However, the level was elevated in only 7/13 (23.3%) of the compensated patients (3 were LRS, 4 were DCM) (P = 0.002). The NT-Pro BNP level was also elevated in 18/19 cases with pulmonary hypertension (P = 0.01). Finally, we conclude that the NT-ProBNP level is elevated in both LRS and DCM in pediatric age. This elevation is more remarkable with heart failure and increased PAP in both diseased groups. The level was also elevated and correlated to Qp/Qs in the LRS patients.
