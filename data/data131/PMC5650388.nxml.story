In this retrospective study, we investigated whether the kinetic change of serum carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) levels can be an early indicator for the progression in metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients during maintenance therapy with bevacizumab plus pemetrexed. Ten patients diagnosed with metastatic lung adenocarcinoma who received a first-line therapy including bevacizumab-based chemotherapy and a following maintenance therapy including bevacizumab plus pemetrexed from June 2015 to October 2016 were recruited in this study. During the maintenance treatment, patientsâ€™ CEA levels all elevated at or after the first cycle of maintenance treatment with a median CEA elevation-free survival time as 17.7 days, which was far more shorter than the median progression-free survival time evaluated by CT imaging specially for maintenance treatment (102.2 days). Before the disease progressed, the values of CEA increased steadily for several cycles with the response evaluation still as stable disease, indicating that the changes of CEA level would be earlier and more sensitive for detection of progression. The CEA kinetic was calculated with a mean of 9.6451 and a median of 8.0135, which sensitively reflected the increasing rate of CEA levels at an early stage. Our study showed that the kinetic change of CEA could be an early predictor for the progression in metastatic NSCLC patients during maintenance therapy.
