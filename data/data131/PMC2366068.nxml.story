To know whether one is looking at an object seen a few seconds ago or not depends on visual short-term memory. To study short-term memory, we recorded single neuronal activity from two brain areas of monkeys, the TE and the perirhinal cortex of the temporal lobe, known to be important in visual pattern recognition and memory. The monkeys performed a short-term visual memory task, a sequential match-to-sample. The monkeys had to signal when a sample stimulus reappeared in a short sequence of stimuli. In area TE only, small fluctuations occurring for a sample-elicited response were correlated with the responses when a match stimulus reappeared, as if a snapshot of the sample-induced response was stored and recalled. In our modeling, we propose that each TE neuron stores and compares the signals during short-term memory by storing the response to the sample in local and rapidly adapting synapses. Subsequent stimulus-elicited responses are then automatically multiplied by the locally stored signal. Here, we show that the match can be detected when the sum of the outputs of the population of TE neurons crosses a threshold. Correlated fluctuations will be a signature this type of local memory storage wherever it occurs in the brain.
