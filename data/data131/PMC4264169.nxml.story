Exposure to the ultraviolet component of sunlight causes DNA damage, which subsequently leads to mutations, cellular transformation, and cell death. DNA photoproducts with (6-4) pyrimidine-pyrimidone adducts are more mutagenic than cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers. These lesions must be repaired because of the high mutagenic potential of (6-4) photoproducts. We here reviewed the structures of (6-4) photoproducts, particularly the detailed structures of the (6-4) lesion and (6-4) lesion-containing double-stranded DNA. We also focused on interactions with their binding proteins such as antibody Fabs, (6-4) photolyase, and nucleotide excision repair protein. The (6-4) photoproducts that bound to these proteins had common structural features: The 5'-side thymine and 3'-side pyrimidone bases of the T(6-4)T segment were in half-chair and planar conformations, respectively, and both bases were positioned nearly perpendicularly to each other. Interactions with binding proteins showed that the DNA helices flanking the T(6-4)T segment were largely kinked, and the flipped-out T(6-4)T segment was recognized by these proteins. These proteins had distinctive binding-site structures that were appropriate for their functions.
