Deleterious mutations reduce fitness within natural populations and must be continually removed by natural selection. However, some deleterious mutations reach unexpectedly high frequencies. There are a number of mechanisms by which this could occur, including changes in genetic or environmental constraints. Here, we investigate the hypothesis that some deleterious mutations have hitchhiked to high frequency due to linkage to sites that have been under positive selection. Using a collated set of regions likely to have been influenced by positive selection, we find that the number of deleterious polymorphisms in hitchhiking and non-hitchhiking regions is similar, but that the ratio of deleterious to neutral polymorphism is higher in hitchhiking compared to non-hitchhiking regions. Both computer simulations and empirical data indicate that while hitchhiking eliminates many deleterious mutations, some are increased in frequency. The distribution of human disease-associated mutations is also altered in hitchhiking compared to non-hitchhiking regions. Together, our results provide evidence that hitchhiking has influenced the frequency of linked deleterious mutations in humans, implying that the evolutionary dynamics of advantageous and deleterious mutations may often depend on one another.
