Recently, the cytometry field has experienced rapid advancement in the development of mass cytometry (CyTOF). CyTOF enables a significant increase in the ability to monitor 50 or more cellular markers for millions of cells at the single-cell level. Initial studies with CyTOF focused on few samples, in which expert manual discovery of cell types were acceptable. As the technology matures, it is now feasible to collect more samples, which enables systematic studies of cell types across multiple samples. However, the statistical and computational issues surrounding multi-sample analysis have not been previously examined in detail. Furthermore, it was not clear how the data analysis could be scaled for hundreds of samples, such as those in clinical studies. In this work, we present a scalable analysis pipeline that is grounded in strong statistical foundation. Partition-Assisted Clustering (PAC) offers fast and accurate clustering and Multiple Alignments of Networks (MAN) utilizes network structures learned from each homogeneous cluster to organize the data into data-set level clusters. PAC-MAN thus enables the analysis of a large CyTOF dataset that was previously too large to be analyzed systematically; this pipeline can be extended to the analysis of similarly large or larger datasets.
