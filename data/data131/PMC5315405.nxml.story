The biological functionality of several receptors and enzymes depends on their capability to sustain large-scale structural fluctuations and adopt different conformational states in response to ligand binding. This is the case for G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), the largest superfamily of signaling proteins in mammals and a primary pharmaceutical target. To better understand the functional dynamics of GPCRs, we have analysed the inter-residue distance variations across the available structures for several receptors of the rhodopsin-like family (class A). We first reconstructed the network of mechanical, rigid-like couplings between nearby amino acids and then identified those acting as dynamical/mechanical hubs. These were the sites whose virtual removal led to a significant softening of the overall mechanical network. After validating the biological relevance of these sites by comparison against known key functional sites, we singled out those regions which emerge as prominent mechanical hubs and yet have an otherwise still unknown functional role. The most relevant of such novel putative functional sites, which could be probed by mutagenesis experiments, is at interface of two transmembrane helices and we expect it to be crucial for assisting GPCRs conformational response to agonist binding.
