The present study was performed to examine how transforming growth factor β (TGF-β) in root-surrounding tissues on deciduous teeth regulates the differentiation induction into odontoclasts during physiological root resorption. We prepared root-surrounding tissues with (R) or without (N) physiological root resorption scraped off at three regions (R1–R3 or N1–N3) from the cervical area to the apical area of the tooth and measured both TGF-β and the tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP) activities. The TGF-β activity level was increased in N1–N3, whereas the TRAP activity was increased in R2 and R3. In vitro experiments for the receptor activator of nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) ligand (RANKL)-mediated osteoclast differentiation revealed that proteins from N1–N3 and R1–R3 enhanced the TRAP activity in RAW264 cells. A genetic study indicated that the mRNA levels of TGF-β1 in N1 and N2 were significantly increased, and corresponded with levels of osteoprotegerin (OPG). In contrast, the expression level of RANKL was increased in R2 and R3. Our findings suggest that TGF-β is closely related to the regulation of OPG induction and RANKL-mediated odontoclast differentiation depending on the timing of RANKL and OPG mRNA expression in the root-surrounding tissues of deciduous teeth during physiological root resorption.
