Recurrently connected populations of excitatory and inhibitory neurons found in cortex are known to produce rich and irregular spiking activity, with complex trial-to-trial variability in response to input stimuli. Many theoretical studies found this firing regime to be associated with chaos, where tiny perturbations explode to impact subsequent neural activity. As a result, the precise spiking patterns produced by such networks would be expected to be too fragile to carry any valuable information about stimuli, since inevitable sources of noise such as synaptic failure or ion channel fluctuations would be amplified by chaotic dynamics on repeated trials. In this article we revisit the implications of chaos in input-driven networks and directly measure its impact on evoked population spike patterns. We find that chaotic network dynamics can, in fact, produce highly patterned spiking activity which can be used by a simple decoder to perform input-classification tasks. This can be explained by the presence of low-dimensional, input-specific chaotic attractors, leading to a form of trial-to-trial variability that is intermittent, rather than uniformly random. We propose that chaos is a manageable by-product of recurrent connectivity, which serves to efficiently distribute information about stimuli throughout a network.
