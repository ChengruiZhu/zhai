INTRODUCTION: Multiple factors of vulnerability may lead to development of abnormal social behaviour and to important psychiatric diseases. The psychopathological characteristics present at individual level can lead to a pattern of population groups that are subject to developing mental illness risks. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Multidisciplinary study (2009-2011) to assessing the current situation of mental health and identifying population risk groups for developing psychiatric disorders in a non-institutionalised population. We used the Woodworth Mathews Inventory (76 items) to a randomly selected sample of 1,200 men and women, residents in urban and rural areas. RESULTS: The extreme scores for emotiveness had a frequency more than triple for women, and we found a similar situation for obsessive-neurasthenic and depressive tendencies. People aging over 35 years had a double score (limit and poignancy) for depression than younger people, meanwhile correlation between age under 35 years and instability and antisocial tendencies is highly statistically significant (p<0.001), the frequency of extreme scores being almost double than in the older people. CONCLUSIONS: Female gender has a vulnerability for develop depressive and emotional disorders and age over 35 is also significant correlated with depressive tendencies. Younger people (under 35 years) are predisposed for pathological antisocial behaviour, fact revealed by the high scores for instability and antisocial tendencies. It is necessary to develop a program focused on the two risk categories to prevent the possible occurrence of psychiatric disorders.
