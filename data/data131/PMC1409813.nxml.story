The cerebral cortex is continuously active in the absence of sensory stimuli. An example of this spontaneous activity is the phenomenon of voltage transitions between two distinct levels, called Up and Down states, observed simultaneously when recoding from many neurons. This phenomenon could be of a critical importance for working memory and attention. Thus, uncovering its biological mechanism could reveal fundamental properties of the cortical organization. In this theoretical contribution, Holcman and Tsodyks propose a mathematical model of cortical dynamics that exhibits spontaneous transitions between Up and Down states. The model describes an activity of a network of interconnected neurons. A crucial component of the model is synaptic depression of interneuronal connections, which is a well-known effect that characterizes many types of synaptic connections in the cortex. Despite its simplicity, the model reproduces many properties of Upâ€“Down transitions that were experimentally observed, and makes several intriguing predictions for future experiments. In particular, the model predicts that the time that a network spends in the Up state is highly variable, changing from a fraction of a second to more than ten seconds, which could have some interesting implications for the temporal characteristics of working memory.
