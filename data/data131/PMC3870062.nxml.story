A substantial amount of evidence has proposed an important role for Cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) enzyme in brain diseases and affiliate disorders. The purpose of this research was studying the effects of COX-2 selective inhibition on haloperidol-induced catatonia in an animal model of drug overdose and Parkinsonâ€™s disease (PD). In this study, the effect of acute and Sub-chronic oral administration of a new selective COX-2 inhibitor, i.e. the compound 11b or 1-(Phenyl)-5-(4-methylsulfonylphenyl)-2-ethylthioimidazole, in a dosage of 2, 4 and 8 mg/kg on haloperidol-induced catatonia was evaluated and compared to the standard drug scopolamine (1 mg/kg) by microanalysis of Striatum dopaminergic neurotransmission. The results showed a very high potency for 11b in improving the catalepsy by enhancing the dopaminergic neurotranmission (p < 0.05). In addition, statistical analysis showed the dose- and time-dependent behavior of the observed protective effect of 11b against the haloperidol-induced catatonia and enhancement of the dopaminergic neurotransmission. These findings are additional pharmacological data that suggest the effectiveness of COX-2 inhibition in treatment of schizophreny-associated rigidity.
