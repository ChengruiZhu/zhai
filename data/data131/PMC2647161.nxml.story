Alzheimerâ€™s disease (AD) is the most common neurodegenerative disease in the developed world. The increasing life expectancy in the last years has led to an increase in the prevalence of this age-related condition and has posed an important medical and social challenge for developed societies. The mainstays of current therapy for AD rely on the cholinergic hypothesis developed more than 20 years ago. These compounds, known as acetylcholinesterase inhibitors (AChEIs), inhibit the cholinesterases and aim at improving the brain synaptic availability of acetylcholine. These drugs have been approved for the treatment of AD based on pivotal clinical trials showing modest symptomatic benefit on cognitive, behavioral, and global measures. Memantine, an NMDA antagonist, has been recently included as a therapeutic option for AD. Memantine can be combined safely with AChEIs for an additional symptomatic benefit. During the last years our understanding of the mechanisms underlying the pathogenesis of AD has markedly expanded. Several putative neuroprotective drugs are thoroughly investigated and many of them have reached the clinical arena. It can be anticipated that some of these drugs will be able to slow/prevent the progression of this condition in the near future.
