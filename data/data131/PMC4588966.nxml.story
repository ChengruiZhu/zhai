Twenty-four patients were deceased or refused to participate at follow-up, and 284 patients(293 hips) met the inclusion criteria. The average age was 42 years(range, 18 to 77) and there were 140 females and 144 males. Sixty-eight hips (68 patients) required a total hip arthroplasty (THA) (24%). The average age of the THA group was 52 years (range, 32 to 77), with 60 patients (88%) over 40 years of age at the time of arthroscopy. There were 22 females (32%) and 46 males (68%). The average time to THA was 34.6 months post-operatively (range, 7 months to 5 years) and the average pre-operative MHHS was 58 (range, 24 to 100). Of the remaining 216 patients (225 hips), 171 patients (79%, or 178 hips) were available for follow up at a minimum of 5 years. The average follow-up was 6.6 years (range, 5 to 7.2). The MHHS improved from 61 to 80(p<0.001). The average WOMAC at follow-up was 9.0 and the median Tegner activity scale was 4.0. The median patient satisfaction with outcome was 9 (range, 1 to 10). There was no difference in the MHHS between patients who underwent labral debridement or labral repair(p=0.1). The significant multivariate predictors of increased post-operative patient satisfaction at follow-up were higher modified Harris Hip Scores (p=0.003) and not having a microfracture performed(p=0.015)(r
