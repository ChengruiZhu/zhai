This systematic review is to explore the prevalence of depression in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) in China. Articles of prevalence rates for depression in adult RA patients published before October 2015 were identified from PubMed, Embase, The Cochrane Library, CNKI, CBM, VIP, and Wanfang database and other internet databases. Relevant journals and the recommendations of expert panels were also searched manually. Two independent reviewers searched and assessed the literature. Therelevant data were applied with Meta-Analyst 3.13 software, and the forest plot and funnel plot were performed. 21 studies with a total of 4447 patients were selected to be enrolled in this study. The prevalence of depression by analyzing the effect size was 48% [95% CI (41%, 56%)]. The prevalence of minor depression and dysthymic disorder was 30% [95%CI (23%, 38%)], and the moderate or major depression was 18% [95%CI (11%, 29%)], respectively. Subgroup analysis showed that the depression rate of female RA patients was higher than male. The depression rate in the central and western areas were higher than that of the eastern region of China, the prevalence level estimated by the Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS) was higher than estimated by other tools. Sensitivity analysis showed that the pooled effect size had good stability and reliability, To be conclusive, the prevalence rate of depression in RA patients is 48%, which suggesting that medical staff should pay more attention to depression in adult patients with RA.
