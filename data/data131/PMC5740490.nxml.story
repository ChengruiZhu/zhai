 Thiopurine S-methyltransferase (TPMT) enzyme metabolizes thiopurine drugs which are widely used in various disciplines as well as in leukemias. Individual enzyme activity varies depending on the genetic polymorphisms of TPMT gene located at chromosome 6. Up to 14% of popu-lation is known to have a decreased enzyme activity, and if treated with standard doses of thiopurines, these individuals are at a high risk of severe Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR) as myelosuppression, gas-trointestinal intolerance, pancreatitis and hypersensitivity. However, TPMT-deficient patients can suc-cessfully be treated with decreased thiopurine doses if enzyme status is identified by a prior testing. TPMT status identification is a pioneering experience in application of pharmacogenetic testing in clini-cal settings. 4 TPMT (*2, *3A, *3B, *3C) alleles are known to account for 80-95% of a decreased en-zyme activity, and therefore, identifying the presence of these alleles supported by phenotypic measure-ment of the enzyme activity can reveal patientâ€™s TPMT status. Evaluation of the levels of thiopurine me-tabolites further supports the practice of appropriate dose adjustment by providing the efficient monitor-ing of drug cytotoxicity.
