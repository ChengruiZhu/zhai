The presence of an intracranial aneurysm together with a pituitary adenoma presents tremendous risk of subarachnoid hemorrhage, during transsphenoidal surgery, particularly when the aneurysm lies near the operative field. A left supraclinoid internal carotid artery aneurysm and a clinically nonfunctioning pituitary adenoma coexisted in a 57-year-old woman. Initially, the aneurysm was treated by endovascular coil placement, and then the patient underwent pseudocapsule-based extracapsular resection of the pituitary tumor via a transnasal transsphenoidal endoscopic approach. Pseudocapsule-based extracapsular total resection was safely performed, because of the extirpated risk of rupture of the coil-treated aneurysm. Recently, transsphenoidal pseudocapsule-based extracapsular resection approach for pituitary adenomas provides a more effective and safe alternative compared to the traditional intracapsular one because of its higher tumor removal and remission rates and lower recurrence rate. Compared with conventional subcapsular removal, pseudocapsule-based extracapsular resection has more risks of aneurysmal rupture that is located adjacent to pituitary adenoma. Thus, in a patient having a cerebral aneurysm with the proximity to the operative field, the cerebral aneurysm should be first treated with endovascular coil placement or direct surgical procedure; subsequently, pseudocapsule-based extracapsular resection of the pituitary tumor via a transnasal transsphenoidal endoscopic approach should be performed.
