We present a novel computational workflow for quantifying hemodynamic forces in developing zebrafish embryos by coupling high resolution 4-D light sheet imaging with a moving domain blood flow solver. Our framework employs deformable image registration to extract the motion of the ventricle from high resolution image data. This produces a robust and efficient workflow, as segmentation is performed at only one cardiac phase, while the wall position in other cardiac phases is found from the displacement field obtained during image registration. This approach avoids a laborious process of manual segmentation in all cardiac phases, and minimizes spurious errors arising from manual processing. Our validated flow solver is optimized for cardiac hemodynamics with backflow stabilization, efficient data management and dynamic remeshing algorithms for moving domains. We demonstrate the utility of the framework in wild type zebrafish and three treated variants in which the formation of cardiac trabeculations is disrupted. In this study, we then quantify the relationship between oscillatory shear forces and the presence or absence of ventricular trabeculation during cardiac development. Our framework has broad applicability in cardiac developmental studies focused on quantitatively investigating the mechanobiology during morphogenesis.
