The arachnoidal sleeve around the pituitary stalk (ASPS) was noted to be comprised of a compact fibrous component and a related loose trabecular component. The pituitary stalk was divided into four segments in accordance with the folds of the ASPS. Correspondingly, the growth of CPs was divided into four basic patterns—infra-diaphragmatic (ID), extra-arachnoidal (EA), intra-arachnoidal (IA) and sub-arachnoidal (SA) growth. The IA growth pattern can be further subdivided into two subtypes—namely, IA1 (with tumor growing within the fibrous component of the ASPS) and IA2 (with tumor growing within the trabecular component). This method of topographical division can be used to understand the growth of CP—infra-diaphragmatic CP show growth pattern ID or ID together with EA. Suprasellar CP can show an extra-ventricular growth pattern (EA or IA2), an extra- and intra-ventricular (IA2 + SA) growth pattern, a trans-infundibular growth pattern (ID + IA1 + SA) and an infundibulo-tuberal growth pattern (SA or SA + IA1). There is a statistically significant difference between CP growth patterns in children and adults. A predominance of ID growth is noted in children while adults tend to show a pattern of predominantly Extra-ventricular (EV) growth.
