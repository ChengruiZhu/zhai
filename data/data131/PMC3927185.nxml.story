 = 9), who underwent elective caesarean delivery. Nine parturients with CKD of various etiologies, who underwent elective Caesarean delivery, were included in this study. Spinal anest-hesia was administered in all parturients with normal coagulation profile through a 25-gauze spinal needle (Quincke) with 0.5% (H) bupivacaine in L2-3 space and T6 level was achieved. Hemodynamics and side effects such as nausea, vomiting, headache, and backache were record. The mean age was 28.22 ± 4.43 years. The mean levels of serum creatinine and serum potassium were 2.78 ± 1.29 mg/dl and 4.11 ± 0.46 meq/l, respectively. Mean baseline values of systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, and pulse rate were higher which decreased after spinal anesthesia. However, the incidence of hypotension, which required mephentermine treatment, was 11.1%. One patient had symptoms of nausea and vomiting/dizziness at the time of hypotension, which disappeared after treatment with 5 mg of intravenous mephentermine. Baseline value of PR remained high throughout the operation. Parturients with CKD with normal coagulation profile remained hemodynamically stable under spinal anesthesia with minimal side effects. However, a large number of studies are required to determine the safety of spinal anesthesia in this setting.
