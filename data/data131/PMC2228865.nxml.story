Macroscopic currents in Na channels were recorded from adult frog skeletal muscle under voltage clamp as various toxins were added to the bathing medium. Veratridine, cevadine, and 3-(4-ethoxybenzoyl)- veracevine modified the Na channels in a use-dependent manner during depolarizations and held them open for 3, 2.4, and 1.2 s, respectively, at -90 mV. The three alkaloids modified channels in the same way. Activation gating was shifted about -100 mV by the modification, and reversible closing of the channels by strong hyperpolarizations slowed reversal of the modification. The synthetic insecticides deltamethrin, EDO, GH739, and GH414 also modified channels during depolarizations that opened channels. The modification lasted 3 s with deltamethrin, but only 3-5 ms with the others. Hyperpolarization speeded the shutting off of current in insecticide-modified channels, but no reversible activation gating could be demonstrated. The ionic selectivity, PNa/PNH4, of channels was decreased by all of the toxins. This ratio was 0.11 in normal channels, 0.26 in insecticide-modified channels, and 0.7-1.6 in veratrum-alkaloid-modified channels. During use-dependent modification, the veratrum alkaloids reduced the total Na current markedly, while deltamethrin did not. Thus, alkaloid and insecticide modifications share many features but differ in how much the conducting properties of the pore are changed and whether the channel can close reversibly while the toxin remains bound.
