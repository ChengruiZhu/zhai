Postoperative monitoring for patients with colorectal cancer (CRC) requires sensitive biomarkers that are associated with medical response and adjuvant therapy following surgery. Conventional tumor biomarkers [including carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), CA19-9 and CA125] are widely used, but none of the markers provide high sensitivity or specificity. Previous studies indicated that circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) is useful for postoperative monitoring of patients with cancer. However, the majority of previous studies involved patients with lung cancer, and therefore further studies are required which investigate patients with CRC. The present study enrolled 11 patients with CRC. All patients underwent surgery, and a number of patients were treated with postoperative chemotherapy. Tumor tissues and serial blood samples were collected from each patient, and somatic mutations of each sample were obtained using next-generation sequencing. The mutation landscape and dynamic changes in mutations for each patient were analyzed, and these results were compared with the changes of CEA levels. A number of driver genes were selected, including tumor protein P53 (TP53), APC and KRAS, to monitor the postoperative outcome of the 11 patients with CRC. Driver mutations were detected in preoperative plasma in 7 patients, with markedly decreased mutation rates detected in postoperative plasma compared with preoperative plasma. Driver mutations were not detected in 4 patients in the preoperative or postoperative plasma. In 1 patient with metastatic rectal cancer, the rate of TP53 mutation increased from 8.95 (preoperative) to 71.4% (postoperative), and a new phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate 3-kinase catalytic subunit Î± mutation emerged. This patient succumbed to mortality six months following surgery, however there were no marked changes in CEA levels during periodic detection of CEA levels. In summary, ctDNA has a high sensitivity and specificity in prediction of the prognosis of patients with CRC.
