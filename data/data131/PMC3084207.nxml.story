While previous genome-wide association studies have implicated numerous loci associated with complex traits, such loci typically account for a very small proportion of phenotypic variation. However, a recent study using height as a model trait has illustrated that common single nucleotide polymorphisms can explain a large amount of genetic variance when evaluated through whole-genome statistical models. However, it is unclear to what extent higher proportions of explained variance will translate into improved predictive accuracy in future populations. Here we evaluate the predictive ability of whole-genome models for human height while varying the modeling approach, the size of the training population, the validation design, and the number of SNPs. Our results suggest that whole-genome prediction models can yield higher accuracy than what is commonly attained by models based on a few selected SNPs; yet, given the heritability of the trait in question, there exists room for improving prediction accuracy. While gains in predictive accuracy are likely to be small based on more expansive genotyping, our results indicate that more substantial benefits are likely to be gained through larger training populations, as well through the inclusion of related individuals.
