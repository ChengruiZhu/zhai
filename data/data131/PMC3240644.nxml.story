Several reports have shown that circulating insulin level is positively correlated with arterial calcification; however, the relationship between insulin and arterial calcification remains controversial and the mechanism involved is still unclear. We used calcifying vascular smooth muscle cells (CVSMCs), a specific subpopulation of vascular smooth muscle cells that could spontaneously express osteoblastic phenotype genes and form calcification nodules, to investigate the effect of insulin on osteoblastic differentiation of CVSMCs and the cell signals involved. Our experiments demonstrated that insulin could promote alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity, osteocalcin expression and the formation of mineralized nodules in CVSMCs. Suppression of receptor activator of nuclear factor ÎºB ligand (RANKL) with small interfering RNA (siRNA) abolished the insulin-induced ALP activity. Insulin induced the activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK)1/2, mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and RAC-alpha serine/threonine-protein kinase (Akt). Furthermore, pretreatment of human osteoblasts with the ERK1/2 inhibitor PD98059, but not the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) inhibitor, LY294002, or the Akt inhibitor, 1L-6-hydroxymethyl-chiro-inositol 2-(R)-2-
