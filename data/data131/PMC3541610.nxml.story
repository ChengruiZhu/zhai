The effect of transaortic constriction (TAC)–induced left ventricular (LV) pressure overload was examined in mice with selective mutations in the PKGIα leucine zipper interaction domain. Compared with wild-type littermate controls, in response to TAC, these Leucine Zipper Mutant (LZM) mice developed significant LV systolic and diastolic dysfunction by 48 hours (n=6 WT sham, 6 WT TAC, 5 LZM sham, 9 LZM TAC). In response to 7-day TAC, the LZM mice developed increased pathologic hypertrophy compared with controls (n=5 WT sham, 4 LZM sham, 8 WT TAC, 11 LZM TAC). In WT mice, but not in LZM mice, phosphodiesterase 5 (PDE5) inhibition with sildenafil (Sil) significantly inhibited TAC-induced cardiac hypertrophy and LV systolic dysfunction in WT mice, but this was abolished in the LZM mice (n=3 WT sham, 4 LZM sham, 3 WT TAC vehicle, 6 LZM TAC vehicle, 4 WT TAC Sil, 6 LZM TAC Sil). And in response to prolonged, 21-day TAC (n=8 WT sham, 7 LZM sham, 21 WT TAC, 15 LZM TAC), the LZM mice developed markedly accelerated mortality and congestive heart failure. TAC induced activation of JNK, which inhibits cardiac remodeling in vivo, in WT, but not in LZM, hearts, identifying a novel signaling pathway activated by PKGIα in the heart in response to LV pressure overload.
