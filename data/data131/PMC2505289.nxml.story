The article we reproduce here details the two major theories of congenital dislocation of the hip: “a primary germinal fault…(and)…a defect of development of environmental origin” [1]. As a true scientist, he commented, “The most commonly accepted theory of developmental abnormality is a primary failure of proper formation of the acetabulum, particularly a germinal failure of development of the posterior superior buttress of the ilium…It is difficult to see how an observer, unless influenced by the weight of pre-existing statements and concepts, can authoritatively state a hypothesis as an accepted fact. The author denies dogmatically, for example, that there is scientific evidence of a primary genetic developmental fault of the posterior superior portion of the acetabulum. He does not refute the existence of such a lesion, but contends that no satisfactory evidence has been submitted that this lesion is the primary developmental fault.” How often do we make our judgments based on the “weight of preexisting statements,” rather than compelling observations and data? Also as a true scientist, his thorough review leads to and ends with a hypothesis: “Congenital dislocation and congenital dysplasia of the hip may be regarded as the result of faulty development, due to environmental factors extrinsic to the hip joint. An inherited fault in the timing of development may produce these extrinsic changes… Heredity can play an important part in altering the growth and time factors.” Despite astonishing technical advances, we have the same working hypothesis today and DDH may indeed be related to the timing of genetically controlled events in conjunction with external factors; the details of the genetic factors are being explored with tools not available to Dr. Badgley, but we seem no closer to the larger answer.
