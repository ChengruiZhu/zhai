Burning of fat is essential to provide energy to our bodies. However, fat metabolism is also involved in well-known diseases, such as metabolic syndrome and type 2 diabetes. In severe, inherited deficiencies of enzymes in the fatty-acid oxidation pathway, children run the risk of life-threatening low glucose levels or ‘hypoglycemia’. This typically occurs during overnight fasting, when the body depends on fat stores for its energy supply. To understand the sequence of events leading to hypoglycemia and eventually provide novel therapies, we simulated the process with a validated computer model. We found that when the supply of fat to the liver was increased beyond a critical value, the rate of fatty-acid oxidation declined. Under these circumstances, intermediate metabolites accumulated, very much like the situation in a traffic jam. The risk of a metabolic traffic jam was enhanced in fatty-acid oxidation disorders. In the body this would lead to insufficient energy to maintain blood glucose levels. In this paper we unravel the vicious cycle that leads to the detrimental flux decline and identify a critical role for the last enzyme of the pathway, MCKAT. Our results suggests that MCKAT or its regulators may be promising drug targets.
