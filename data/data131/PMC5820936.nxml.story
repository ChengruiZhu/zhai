 (ExPEC) acts as a commensal within the mammalian gut but can induce pathology upon dissemination to other host environments such as the urinary tract and bloodstream. ExPEC genomes are likely shaped by evolutionary forces encountered within the gut, where the bacteria spend much of their time, provoking the question of how their extraintestinal virulence traits arose. The principle of coincidental evolution, in which a gene that evolved in one niche happens to be advantageous in another, has been used to argue that ExPEC virulence factors originated in response to selective pressures within the gut ecosystem. As a test of this hypothesis, the fitness of ExPEC mutants lacking canonical virulence factors was assessed within the intact murine gut in the absence of antibiotic treatment. We found that most of the tested factors, including cytotoxic necrotizing factor type 1 (CNF1), Usp, colibactin, flagella, and plasmid pUTI89, were dispensable for gut colonization. The deletion of genes encoding the adhesin PapG or the toxin HlyA had transient effects but did not interfere with longer-term persistence. In contrast, a mutant missing the type 1 pilus-associated adhesin FimH displayed somewhat reduced persistence within the gut. However, this phenotype varied dependent on the presence of specific competing strains and was partially attributable to aberrant flagellin expression in the absence of
