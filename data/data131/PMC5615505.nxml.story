Climate warming generates a tremendous threat to the stability of geographically-isolated wetland (GIW) ecosystems and changes the type of evaporation and atmospheric precipitation in a region. The intrinsic balance of biogeochemical processes and enzyme activity in GIWs may be altered as well. In this paper, we sampled three types of GIWs exhibiting different kinds of flooding periods. With the participation of real-time temperature regulation measures, we assembled a computer-mediated wetland warming micro-system in June 2016 to simulate climate situation of ambient temperature (control group) and two experimental temperature differences (+2.5 °C and +5.0 °C) following a scientific climate change circumstance based on daily and monthly temperature monitoring at a two-minutes scale. Our results demonstrate that the contents of the total organic carbon (TOC), total nitrogen (TN), and total phosphorus (TP) in the warmed showed, roughly, a balance or a slight decrease than the control treatment. Warming obstructed the natural subsidence of sediment, but reinforced the character of the ecological source, and reduced the activity of urease (URE), but promoted the activity of alkaline phosphatase (AKP) and sucrase (SUC). Redundancy analysis showed that sucrase, urease, available phosphorus (AP), and pH were the major correlating factors under warming conditions in our research scope. Total organic carbon, total nitrogen, sucrase, catalase (CAT), and alkaline phosphatase were the principal reference factors to reflect the ambient temperature variations. Nutrient compositions and enzyme activities in GIW ecosystems could be reconstructed under the warming influence.
