The trimeric Cdk7路cyclin H路Mat1 complex functions in cell cycle regulation, as the Cdk-activating kinase, and in transcription, as a module of the general transcription factor TFIIH. As a component of TFIIH, Cdk7 phosphorylates serines 5 and 7 of the carboxyl-terminal domain of RNA polymerase II and can also directly phosphorylate transcription factors to regulate gene expression. Here we have investigated the function of the Cdk7路cyclin H路Mat1 complex in murine embryonic stem (ES) cells and preimplantation embryos to determine whether it regulates the unique cell cycle structure and transcriptional network of pluripotent cells. We demonstrate that depletion of cyclin H leads to differentiation of ES cells independent of changes in cell cycle progression. In contrast, we observed that developmental genes are acutely up-regulated after cyclin H down-regulation, likely perturbing normal ES self-renewal pathways. We further demonstrate that Spt5, a known phosphorylation target of Cdk7, similarly regulates ES pluripotency and gene expression. Consistent with its function in ES cells, cyclin H depletion from mouse embryos also leads to defects in the expansion of the inner cell mass of blastocysts, a transient pluripotent stem cell population
