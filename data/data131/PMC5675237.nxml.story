Past research has suggested that social support can reduce the negative psychological consequences associated with infertility. Online discussion boards (ODBs) appear to be a novel and valuable venue for men with fertility problems to acquire support from similar others. Research has not employed a social support framework to classify the types of support men are offered and receive. Using template, content, and thematic analysis, this study sought to identify what types of social support men seek and receive on online infertility discussion boards while exploring how men having fertility problems use appraisal support to assist other men. One hundred and ninety-nine unique users were identified on two online infertility discussion boards. Four types of social support (appraisal, emotional, informational, and instrumental) were evident on ODBs, with appraisal support (36%) being used most often to support other men. Within appraisal support, five themes were identified that showed how men communicate this type of support to assist other men: “At the end of the day, we’re all emotionally exhausted”; “So much of this could be me, infertility happens more than you think”; “I’ve also felt like the worst husband in the world”; “It’s just something that nobody ever talks about so it’s really shocking to hear”; “I say this as a man, you’re typing my thoughts exactly.” These findings confirm how ODBs can be used as a potential medium to expand one’s social network and acquire support from people who have had a similar experience.
