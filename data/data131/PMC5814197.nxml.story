There are many stages in the development and metastasis of colorectal cancer (CRC). In this study, we compared the differential expression genes in different stages of metastatic CRC. Then, we screened the continuously up-regulated genes and the continuously down-regulated genes that were associated with the development and metastasis of CRC. After analyzing the intersection of differential expression genes in each stage, we screened the continuously up-regulated genes and deviated genes in the extracellular matrix and the continuously down-regulated genes and deviated genes in the mitochrondia of CRC. Then, we performed gene ontology enrichment analysis of the deviated genes in different phases, and we found that key molecular events occurred in the period extending from stage II to III (early stage of metastasis) of CRC. Furthermore, in this period we found that the chemotaxis of inflammatory cells had decreased in the extracellular matrix. On the other hand, the aerobic respiration had increased in the mitochondrion. Then, we constructed protein-protein interaction network of deviated genes in the extracellular matrix and mitochondrion. We used the network module and hub network to analyze the protein-protein interaction network. The network module analysis showed that the protein complex of VEGFA and CCL7-CCR3 is the key node in the extracellular matrix, while MAPK1 is the key node in the mitochondrion. The hub network analysis showed that the signal transmission chain FN1→SPARC→COL1A1→MMP2 is the key regulatory pathway for extracellular signal transmission. Furthermore, it also showed that CAV1→MAPK3→RAF1→NR3C1→MAPK1→ESR1 is the key regulatory pathway for signal transmission in mitochondrion.
