A total of 4284 antiretroviral-naïve pregnant women initiated CART between January 2006 and February 2009. The majority of women (89%) reported taking all of their medication at every visit. There were 18 (0.4%) deaths reported. Clinicians discontinued CART in 10 patients (0.7%) while 1367 (31.9%) women disengaged from care. Of those disengaging, 404 (29.6%) disengaged early and 963 (70.4%) late. In the multivariate model, the odds of disengagement decreased with increasing age (odds ratio [OR] 0.982; confidence interval [CI] 0.966–0.998) and increasing gestational age at CART initiation (OR 0.925; CI 0.909–0.941). Women receiving care at a district hospital (OR 0.794; CI 0.644–0.980) or tuberculosis medication (OR 0.457; CI 0.202–0.935) were less likely to disengage. The odds of disengagement were higher in married women (OR 1.277; CI 1.034–1.584). The odds of early disengagement decreased with increasing age at CART initiation (OR 0.902; CI 0.881–0.924). The odds of late disengagement decreased with increasing age at CART initiation (OR 0.936; CI 0.917–0.956). While they increased with higher CD4 counts at CART-initiation (OR 1.001; CI 1.000–1001) and in married women (OR 1.297; CI 1.000–1.695)
