The incidence of cancers is increasing and this is associated with an increase in the burden of the disease. Patients with cancer have to deal with reduced physical functioning, emotional instability, difficulty in concentrating, and an overall diminished feeling of well-being. This creates deficits that have not been well catered for by traditional cancer care, leading to an overall dissatisfaction with care and a reduced quality of life. This review aims at assessing the pattern of unmet needs in cancer patients and to provide information as to the factors that influence the perception of unmet needs. Studies directly focused on unmet needs in cancer patients which were retrieved from Medical Literature Analysis and Retrieval System Online (MEDLINE), Public/Publisher MedlineÂ (PubMed), PsychINFO, Excerpta Medica database (EMBASE), and Google Scholar; from the earliest records till 2016. Unmet needs in cancer patients have been measured with a wide variety of tools, with the supportive care needs survey (SCNS) being the most commonly used as a result of its strong psychometric properties, ease of use, responsiveness, and its coverage of the major domains of unmet needs. The most common unmet needs were in the domains of health system and information, psychological, and physical and daily living. These needs are influenced by sociodemographic factors such as age, sex, marital status, income level; and clinical factors such as location of cancer, stage of disease, and tumor size. It is clear that cancer patients experience a wide range of unmet supportive needs, for which solutions need to be devised in order to improve the supportive care services for these patients and their overall quality of life.
