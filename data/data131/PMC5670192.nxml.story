Strokes are one of the leading causes of death, morbidity, and disability worldwide, mainly among elderly people. It is also the third most common cause of years of life being lost, indicating a high risk of premature mortality. Revascularisation with endarterectomy (CEA) is effective in reducing the risk of death and strokes in patients with carotid artery stenosis, but the effect of invasive treatment on quality of life (QoL) still needs attention. To shed more light on the patients’ perspective on this health condition, we carried out a review of the literature which aimed to analyze the level of health-related QoL among stroke survivors, with special attention to patients who had been treated with CEA. Strokes significantly reduce the level of QoL, which may subsequently be improved in the course of treatment with CEA. Patients experience a reduced level of QoL in the early postoperative period, but at 1 year following CEA, the level of QoL remains stable and is similar to that of chronically ill patients. The domains of QoL which are most affected are physical and emotional functioning, which also serve as markers for decreased QoL in the long term. Older age and comorbidities are predictors of worse QoL. Stroke survivors require proper care both immediately after a stroke happens and during the long-term rehabilitation. Measurement of QoL and of the determining factors that contribute to a reduced level of QoL, as well as focusing on determinants of QoL in stroke survivors may help to reduce patients’ disability and improve their daily functioning in society as well as reducing the cost of health care.
