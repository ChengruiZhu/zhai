/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) and protein phosphatase inhibitor-1 (PPI-1) were detected by Western blot and RT-qPCR; and the total and phosphorylation of protein kinase Cα/β (PKCα/β) were measured. Aged SHRs with heart failure was characterized by significantly decreased left ventricular ejection fraction and left ventricular fraction shortening, enhanced left ventricular end-diastolic diameter and LV Volume, accompanied by increased plasma NT-proBNP and elevated BNP gene expression. Damaged myofibrils, vacuolated mitochondria and swollen sarcoplasmic reticulum were observed by EM. Myocardium mitochondria CCO and SERCA-2 activity decreased. The expressions of PLB and NCX1 increased significantly with up-regulation of PPI-1 and down-regulation of CaMKII, whereas that of RyR2 decreased. Rosuvastatin was found to ameliorate the heart failure in aged SHRs and to improve changes in SERCA-2a, PLB, RyR2, NCX1, CaMKII and PPI-1; PKCα/β2 signal pathway to be suppressed; the protective effect of Rosuvastatin to be dose dependent. In conclusion, the heart failure of aged SHRs that was developed during the end stage of hypertension could be ameliorated by Rosuvastatin.
