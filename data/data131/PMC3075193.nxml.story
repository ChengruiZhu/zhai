Carcinosarcoma of the esophagus is a malignant neoplasm involving both carcinomatous and sarcomatous components. We report a patient with true esophageal carcinosarcoma who underwent laparoscopy-assisted surgery. An upper gastrointestinal barium study revealed a lobulated intraluminal filling defect in the lower intrathoracic esophagus. The patient underwent esophagectomy and regional lymphadenectomy with gastric tube reconstruction by laparoscopy-assisted surgery and thoracotomy. The esophageal hiatus was entered and the mediastinal esophagus was dissected using a laparoscopic approach. Microscopically, the tumor comprised poorly differentiated squamous cell carcinoma and spindle-shaped cells resembling leiomyosarcoma. Immunohistochemically, spindle-shaped sarcomatous cells displayed strongly positive reaction to vimentin and negative reaction to cytokeratin AE1/AE3 and CD68. No transitional zone was seen between sarcomatous and carcinomatous elements. The patient was finally diagnosed with true esophageal carcinosarcoma. Laparoscopic transhiatal esophagectomy seems to be a rational and safe procedure for lower esophageal neoplasms, even for patients with impaired respiratory function.
