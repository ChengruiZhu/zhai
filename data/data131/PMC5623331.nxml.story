Twenty-two studies (2284 patients with HFpEF and 2302 controls) were included in the final analysis. Patients with HFpEF had significantly lower GLS than healthy subjects (mean −15.7% (range −12% to −18.9%) vs mean −19.9% (range −17.1% to −21.5%), weighted mean difference −4.2% (95% CI −3.3% to −5.0%), p < 0.001, respectively). In addition, patients with HFpEF had also significantly lower GLS than asymptomatic patients (mean −15.5% (range −13.4% to −18.4%) vs mean −18.3% (range −15.1% to −20.4%), weighted mean difference −2.8%(95% CI −1.9% to −3.6%), p < 0.001, respectively). In line, 10 studies showed that the rate of abnormal GLS was significantly higher in patients with HFpEF (mean 65.4% (range 37%–95%)) than in asymptomatic subjects (mean 13% (range 0%–29.6%)). Regarding the prognostic relevance of abnormal GLS in HFpEF, two multicentre studies with large sample size (447 and 348) and high number of events (115 and 177) showed that patients with abnormal GLS had worse cardiovascular (CV) outcomes than those with normal GLS (HR for CV mortality and HF hospitalisation 2.14 (95% CI 1.26 to 3.66) and 1.94 (95% CI 1.22 to 3.07)), even adjusting these analyses for multiples clinical and echocardiographic variables.
