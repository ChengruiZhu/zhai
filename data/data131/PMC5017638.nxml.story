Brain stimulation is increasingly used in clinical settings to treat neurological disorders, but much remains unknown about how stimulation to a single brain region impacts large-scale, brain network activity. Using structural neuroimaging scans, we create computational models of brain dynamics for eight participants to explore how structure-function relationships constrain the effect of stimulation to a single region on the brain as a whole. Our results show that network control theory can be used to predict if the effects of stimulation remain focal or spread globally, and structural connectivity differentially constrains the effects of regional stimulation. Additionally, we study how stimulation of different cognitive systems spreads throughout the brain and find that stimulation of regions within the default mode network provide a mechanism to impart large change in overall brain dynamics through a densely connected structural network. By revealing how the stimulation of different brain regions and cognitive systems spreads differently through the brain, we provide a modeling framework to develop stimulation protocols to personalize medical treatments, enable performance enhancements, and facilitate cortical plasticity.
