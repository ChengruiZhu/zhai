The biological properties of a neutrophil-activating factor (NAF), which was recently identified as a novel peptide of approximately 6,000 mol wt, are described. NAF is produced de novo by human blood monocytes upon stimulation with LPS, PHA, and Con A. It induces two main responses in human neutrophils, i.e., exocytosis (release from specific granules in normal, and from specific and azurophil granules in cytochalasin B-treated cells) and the respiratory burst (formation of superoxide and hydrogen peroxide). The action of NAF appears to be mediated by a surface receptor as shown by the following observations. (a) NAF induces a rapid and transient rise in cytosolic free Ca2+; (b) interaction with NAF results in desensitization, since the cells do not respond to a second NAF challenge; and (c) the respiratory burst elicited by NAF is similar in onset, and time course to that induced by C5a or FMLP. The NAF receptor can be distinguished from the receptors of C5a, FMLP, platelet-activating factor, and leukotriene B4 by the lack of cross-desensitization. Unlike C5a, the other host-derived neutrophil-activating peptide, NAF is not inactivated by serum and thus presumably accumulates in inflamed tissue.
