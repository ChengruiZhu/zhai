 mutation co-express wild-type (Wt)-FLT3, it is not fully understood how Wt-FLT3 expression is associated with the resistance to FLT3 inhibitors. In this study, we elucidated a resistant mechanism by which FL-dependent Wt-FLT3 activation reduced inhibitory effects of FLT3 inhibitors. We demonstrated that FL-stimulation much more strongly reduced growth inhibitory effects of FLT3 inhibitors on Wt- and mutant-FLT3 co-expressing cells than sole mutant-FLT3 expressing cells both in vitro and in vivo. It was also confirmed that FL impaired the anti-leukemia effects of FLT3 inhibitors on primary AML cells. We elucidated that FL impeded the inhibitory effects of FLT3 inhibitors mainly through the activation of Wt-FLT3, but not mutated FLT3, in the Wt- and ITD-FLT3 co-expressing cells. Furthermore, FL-induced activation of Wt-FLT3-MAPK axis was the dominant pathway for the resistance, and the glycosylation of Wt-FLT3 was also vital for FL-dependent kinase activation and following resistance to FLT3 inhibitors. Thus, we clarified the importance of co-expressing Wt-FLT3 in resistance to FLT3 inhibitors. These findings provide us with important implications for clinical application and new strategies to improve clinical outcomes of FLT3 inhibitors.
