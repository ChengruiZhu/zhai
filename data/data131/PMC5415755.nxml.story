Acute kidney injury (AKI) is associated with increased morbidity and mortality. Although there are many causes of AKI, it is known that patients undergoing high-risk surgery are known to be at significant risk. Although much effort has centred on the minimum arterial pressure needed to maintain renal perfusion, this tends to be based on relatively crude measures such as the mean arterial pressure (MAP), which is widely used as an index for the optimal blood pressure. The rationale behind maintaining MAP is to provide adequate organ perfusion, although this is difficult to assess other than by applying crude end-points. Recent studies have examined the progression of AKI as defined by the KDIGO criteria in terms of time-weighted average values for premorbid and within-ICU haemodynamic pressure-related parameters. Although principally performed on patients who had undergone cardiovascular surgery and who were on vasopressor support, some interesting results were obtained suggesting that crude MAP may not be an adequate target in AKI. In patients with AKI progression, greater observed deficits in mean perfusion pressure, diastolic arterial perfusion, and diastolic perfusion pressures were observed. This study may highlight potential modifiable risk factors for the prevention of progression of AKI, and hopefully translate into improved outcomes.
