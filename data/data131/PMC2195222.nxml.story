 Measurements have been made of the permeability of the isolated urinary bladder of the toad to a number of small solute molecules, in the presence and absence of vasopressin. Vasopressin has a strikingly specific effect on increasing permeability of the bladder to a group of small, uncharged amides and alcohols while penetration by other small molecules and ions is unaffected. The movement of urea is passive, as indicated by equal flux rates in the two directions. The reflection coefficients for chloride and thiourea indicate a high degree of impermeability of the bladder to these solutes even in the presence of large net movements of water. The low concentration of thiourea in the tissue water when this compound is added to the mucosal bathing medium indicates that the major permeability barrier to thiourea is at the mucosal surface of the bladder. The findings can be accounted for by a double permeability barrier consisting of a fine selective diffusion barrier and a porous barrier in series. The former would constitute the permeability barrier to most small solutes while the latter would be the rate-limiting barrier for water and the amides. It would be the porous barrier which is affected by vasopressin. Reasons are presented which require both barriers to be contained in or near the plasma membrane at the mucosal surface of the bladder.
