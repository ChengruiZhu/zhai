 development, dendrite arborization sensory neurons (ddaCs) selectively prune their larval dendrites in response to the molting steroid hormone ecdysone, whereas mushroom body γ neurons eliminate their axon branches. However, the underlying molecular mechanisms for both of these modes of pruning were not well understood. Here, we conduct a genome-wide screen and identify a conserved E3 ubiquitin ligase that is critical for pruning both ddaC dendrites and mushroom body γ axons. This ligase complex has four core components—Cullin1, Roc1a, SkpA, and Slimb—that promote ddaC dendrite pruning in response to ecdysone. We show that this ligase facilitates ddaC dendrite pruning through regulation of the InR/PI3K/TOR pathway. The substrate-recognition protein Slimb promotes ubiquitination of Akt, an activator of the InR/PI3K/TOR pathway. Akt ubiquitination leads to its degradation and inactivation of the InR/PI3K/TOR pathway, which is required for dendritic pruning. Consistent with this, ddaC dendrite pruning is inhibited when the InR/PI3K/TOR pathway is activated. Thus, we identify a link between the Cullin1-based E3 ligase and the InR/PI3K/TOR pathway in regulating dendrite pruning. This work represents the first link between neuronal pruning and the insulin signaling pathway, raising interesting questions about how metabolic states may influence the control of such developmental processes.
