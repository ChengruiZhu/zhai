During apoptosis, cells undergo characteristic morphological changes in which the cytoskeleton plays an active role. The cytoskeleton rearrangements have been mainly attributed to actinomyosin ring contraction, while microtubule and intermediate filaments are depolymerized at early stages of apoptosis. However, recent results have shown that microtubules are reorganized during the execution phase of apoptosis forming an apoptotic microtubule network (AMN). Evidence suggests that AMN is required to maintain plasma membrane integrity and cell morphology during the execution phase of apoptosis. The new “two coffins” hypothesis proposes that both AMN and apoptotic cells can adopt two morphological patterns, round or irregular, which result from different cytoskeleton kinetic reorganization during the execution phase of apoptosis induced by genotoxic agents. In addition, round and irregular-shaped apoptosis showed different biological properties with respect to AMN maintenance, plasma membrane integrity and phagocyte responses. These findings suggest that knowing the type of apoptosis may be important to predict how fast apoptotic cells undergo secondary necrosis and the subsequent immune response. From a pathological point of view, round-shaped apoptosis can be seen as a physiological and controlled type of apoptosis, while irregular-shaped apoptosis can be considered as a pathological type of cell death closer to necrosis.
