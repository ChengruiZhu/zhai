Interactions between the albedo and the gloss on a surface are commonplace. Darker surfaces are perceived glossier (contrast gloss) than lighter surfaces and darker backgrounds can enhance perceived lightness of surfaces. We used maximum likelihood conjoint measurements to simultaneously quantify the strength of those effects. We quantified the extent to which albedo can influence perceived gloss and physical gloss can influence perceived lightness. We modeled the contribution of lightness and gloss and found that increasing lightness reduced perceived gloss by about 32% whereas gloss had a much weaker influence on perceived lightness of about 12%. Moreover, we also investigated how different backgrounds contribute to the perception of lightness and gloss of a surface placed in front. We found that a glossy background reduces slightly perceived lightness of the center and simultaneously enhances its perceived gloss. Lighter backgrounds reduce perceived gloss and perceived lightness. Conjoint measurements lead us to a better understanding of the contextual effects in gloss and lightness perception. Not only do we confirm the importance of contrast in gloss perception and the reduction of the simultaneous contrast with glossy backgrounds, but we also quantify precisely the strength of those effects.
