Polycomb group proteins assemble in two major repressive multi-subunit complexes (PRC1 and PRC2), which play important roles in many physiological processes, including stem cell maintenance, differentiation, cell cycle control and cancer. In mammals, six different groups of PRC1 complexes exist (PRC1.1 to PRC1.6), which differ in their subunit composition. The mechanisms that target the different PRC1 complexes to specific genomic sites appear diverse and are poorly understood. In this study, we have investigated the genomic targeting mechanisms of the non-canonical PRC1.6 complex. In PRC1.6, the defining subunit PCGF6 is specifically associated with several proteins including the transcription factors MGA and E2F6, and the histone-binding protein L3MBTL2. We found that MGA is absolutely essential for targeting PRC1.6. MGA executes recruitment of PRC1.6 to its target sites through two distinct functions. On the one hand it acts as a sequence-specific DNA-binding factor; on the other hand it has a scaffolding function, which is independent of its DNA binding capacity. E2F6 and L3MBTL2 are also important in genomic targeting of PRC1.6 as they promote binding of PRC1.6 to different sets of genes associated with distinct functions. Our finding that different components specify loading of PRC1.6 to distinct sets of genes could establish a paradigm for other chromatin-associated complexes.
