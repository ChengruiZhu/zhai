The incidence of prostate cancer is increasing in young men, and young men are more likely to develop more aggressive prostate cancers than older men. These findings suggest biological differences between prostate cancers that develop in young men and in older men; yet little data and few studies on men diagnosed under age 50 years exist. In this study, we investigated whether men diagnosed with prostate cancer at young ages (≤ age 45 years) had different gene expression profiles than men diagnosed at older ages (71–74 years). We found that inflammatory and immune-related pathways were up-regulated in the young group as compared to the older group, suggesting fundamental differences in tumor development. Moreover, 21% of the young group, compared to 8% of the older group, had biochemical recurrence of prostate cancer–a surprising result given that both groups were diagnosed in early stages of disease (all T2, Gleason 7 (3+4). The recurrence in the young group was associated with over-expression of two genes involved in immune regulation. After validation in a larger dataset, these may provide clues for potential biomarkers to test for monitoring which young patients are likely to progress.
