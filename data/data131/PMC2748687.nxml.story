Allostery is the process whereby a molecule binds to one site in a protein and alters the function of a distant site. This phenomenon is ubiquitous, as proteins frequently must adapt their behavior to changes in the cellular milieu. The mechanism(s) underlying allostery remains incompletely understood. In particular, predictive models are needed that distinguish amino-acid residues that are critical to allostery, or “hotspots”, from non-hotspots. Here we have used data-mining approaches to infer rules that distinguish hotspots from non-hotspots. Starting with a data set of known hotspot and non-hotspot residues from a diverse set of allosteric proteins, the training data set, we applied machine learning to this data to “learn” models, or sets of rules, for distinguishing hotspots and non-hotspots by inferring associations between the classification (hotspot or non-hotspot) and an associated set of calculated attributes. Many models that showed the highest predictive power on the training data also exhibited high accuracy and sensitivity when applied to an independent data set. Moreover, the pattern of predicted hotspots in the proteins we studied was consistent with known structure/function relationships and previous work suggesting that a network of essential residues mediates the allosteric transition.
