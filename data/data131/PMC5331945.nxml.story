Obesity results from the imbalance of food intake and energy expenditure. Since the restriction of food intake is difficult and inefficient in maintaining long-term weight loss, enhancing energy expenditure is now an attractive approach in combating obesity. Here, we analysed the role in this process of a natural compound called narciclasine. We showed that narciclasine treatment reduces excess fat accumulation in peripheral metabolic tissues, improves blood metabolic parameters and insulin sensitivity in obese mice, and protects these mice from the loss of voluntary physical activity. Further investigation suggested that narciclasine enhances mitochondrial respiration and fatty acid consumption in the skeletal muscle. In addition, narciclasine strongly activates the AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) signaling, which is a central sensor of the cellular energy status and a key player in maintaining energy homeostasis, specifically in the skeletal muscle. Mechanistically, we found that narciclasine increases cAMP concentration and ADP/ATP ratio in muscle cells, which further lead to AMPK activation. Finally, we observed that narciclasine increases mitochondrial membrane potential and reduces the production of reactive oxygen species in muscle cells. Our findings suggest that narciclasine is a natural compound that attenuates diet-induced obesity in mice by promoting energy expenditure.
