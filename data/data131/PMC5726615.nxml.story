In this article, we examine the challenges of eliminating visceral leishmaniasis in Bangladesh from a policy perspective. Visceral leishmaniasis is a neglected tropical disease which causes significant morbidity and mortality, but recent efforts in Bangladesh, India and Nepal (the countries that used to have two-thirds of all cases in the world) have made significant headway in reducing the extent of the disease. However, ongoing concerted effort is needed to ensure that elimination of the disease is maintained in the long-term. This will require engagement and coordinated effort from a variety of stakeholders, including national and international policy makers, funders and implementers. We present the identified challenges, stakeholder map and potential solutions in the form of a policy brief to distill the key actors and actions that are necessary to maintain momentum towards elimination of visceral leishmaniasis. Such actions include determining optimal long-term vector control and surveillance strategies, and attempting to integrate the visceral leishmaniasis program into existing health systems. The research agenda should also be prioritised, with a focus on addressing operational and technical questions.
