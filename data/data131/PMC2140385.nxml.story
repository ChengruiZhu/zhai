 1. It had been shown in previous publications that when pure water is separated from a solution of an electrolyte by a collodion membrane the ion with the same sign of charge as the membrane increases and the ion with the opposite sign of charge as the membrane diminishes the rate of diffusion of water into the solution; but that the relative influence of the oppositely charged ions upon the rate of diffusion of water through the membrane is not the same for different concentrations. Beginning with the lowest concentrations of electrolytes the attractive influence of that ion which has the same sign of charge as the collodion membrane upon the oppositely charged water increases more rapidly with increasing concentration of the electrolyte than the repelling effect of the ion possessing the opposite sign of charge as the membrane. When the concentration exceeds a certain critical value the repelling influence of the latter ion upon the water increases more rapidly with a further increase in the concentration of the electrolyte than the attractive influence of the ion having the same sign of charge as the membrane. 2. It is shown in this paper that the influence of the concentration of electrolytes on the rate of transport of water through collodion membranes in electrical endosmose is similar to that in the case of free osmosis. 3. On the basis of the Helmholtz theory of electrical double layers this seems to indicate that the influence of an electrolyte on the rate of diffusion of water through a collodion membrane in the case of free osmosis is due to the fact that the ion possessing the same sign of charge as the membrane increases the density of charge of the latter while the ion with the opposite sign diminishes the density of charge of the membrane. The relative influence of the oppositely charged ions on the density of charge of the membrane is not the same in all concentrations. The influence of the ion with the same sign of charge increases in the lowest concentrations more rapidly with increasing concentration than the influence of the ion with the opposite sign of charge, while for somewhat higher concentrations the reverse is true.
