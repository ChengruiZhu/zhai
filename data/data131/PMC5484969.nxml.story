This study aimed to assess the effect of a single IM injection of hydrocortisone succinate in relieving the immediate post-varicocelectomy scrotal edema. In all, 117 patients with grades II and III varicocele who developed post-varicocelectomy scrotal edema were randomly classified into group A (n = 59) that received a single IM hydrocortisone sodium succinate injection plus ordinary post-operative treatment and Group B (n = 58), which received the post-operative treatment alone. All patients were followed up to assess; changes in scrotal edema, the day of return to work and emergence of complications. Post-operative scrotal edema was assessed using a scrotal edema rating grades (SERG = 0–3) score. In group A, scrotal edema disappeared 1 day after steroid injection in 33 patients (55.9%), and after 2 days in the remaining 26 patients (44.1%), and all patients were returned to work within 5–7 days. In group B, the edema remained large in 36 patients (62.1%), moderate in 22 patients (37.9%), and disappeared after 9–12 days; and those patients returned to work within 11–13 days. It is concluded that a single IM hydrocortisone injection could be effective to reduce the immediate post-operative scrotal edema after inguinal varicocelectomy without obvious side effects.
