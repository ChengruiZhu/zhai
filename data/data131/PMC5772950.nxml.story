The aim of the present study was to examine the expression of microRNA (miRNA)-184 in gliomas with different pathological grades, and its effect on survival prognosis. For the present study, 40 participants were selected with different pathological grades of glioma tissues with grade I (n=10), grade II (n=8), grade III (n=16), and grade IV (n=6). In addition, 10 cases of normal brain tissue (obtained by decompression because of traumatic brain injury) were selected. RT-PCR and immunohistochemical techniques were used to detect the expression level and intensity of miRNA-184 in different grades of glioma tissues. The length of survival of miRNA-184-positive patients was analyzed. miRNA-184 mRNA expression was found in normal tissues and tumor tissues, and the expression in tumor tissues was significant (P<0.05). Statistically significant differences of miRNA-184 expression were observed among different grades (P<0.05). miRNA-184 expression increased with the increase of grade level. The differences in expression across grade levels was statistically significant (P<0.05). A positive expression was not related to the pathological types of glioma cells. The median survival time of patients with miRNA-184-positive expression was significantly shorter than that of the negative expression group (P<0.05). miRNA-184 is highly expressed in gliomas, which is positively correlated with pathological grade, and is not correlated with pathological type, and negatively correlated with survival time. Thus, miRNA-184 is a potentially important molecular marker for glioma.
