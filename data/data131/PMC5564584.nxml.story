) is a direct target of miR-19b. An asthma model was established via ovalbumin (OVA) sensitization and challenge in 72 female BALB/c mice. Mice were then assigned to saline, OVA-sensitized, saline+miR-19b mimics, saline+anti-TSLP, OVA-sensitized+miR-19b mimics, OVA-sensitized+mimics scramble, OVA-sensitized+anti-TSLP, and OVA-sensitized+IgG2a groups. Pathological morphology changes were detected through hematoxylin/eosin, Masson, and periodic acid-Schiff staining. miR-19b was downregulated while TSLP and Stat3 were upregulated in the OVA-sensitized group compared with the saline group. Bronchoalveolar lavage fluid samples from OVA-sensitized mice showed increased total protein, IL-4, IL-5 and IL-6 levels, numbers of inflammatory cells, eosinophils, neutrophils, mononuclear macrophages and lymphocytes, and eosinophil% compared to controls. Lung tissues from sensitized mice exhibited decreased superoxide dismutase activity and increased methane dicarboxylic aldehyde levels. The effects of OVA sensitization were reversed in the OVA-sensitized+miR-19b mimics and OVA-sensitized+anti-TSLP groups. These findings suggest miR-19b reduces airway remodeling, airway inflammation, and degree of oxidative stress by inhibiting Stat3 signaling through TSLP downregulation in a mouse asthma model.
