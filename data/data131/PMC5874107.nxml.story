Volumetric‐modulated arc therapy (VMAT) is emerging as a leading technology in treating early‐stage, non‐small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with stereotactic ablative radiotherapy (SABR). However, two other modalities capable of delivering intensity‐modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) include fixed‐beam and helical TomoTherapy (HT). This study aims to provide an extensive dosimetric comparison among these various IMRT techniques for treating early‐stage NSCLC with SABR. Ten early‐stage NSCLC patients were retrospectively optimized using three fixed‐beam techniques via nine to eleven beams (high and low modulation step‐and‐shoot (SS), and sliding window (SW)), two VMAT techniques via two partial arcs (SmartArc (SA) and RapidArc (RA)), and three HT techniques via three different fan beam widths (1 cm, 2.5 cm, and 5 cm) for 80 plans total. Fixed‐beam and VMAT plans were generated using flattening filter‐free beams. SS and SA, HT treatment plans, and SW and RA were optimized using Pinnacle v9.1, Tomoplan v.3.1.1, and Eclipse (Acuros XB v11.3 algorithm), respectively. Dose‐volume histogram statistics, dose conformality, and treatment delivery efficiency were analyzed. VMAT treatment plans achieved significantly lower values for contralateral lung
