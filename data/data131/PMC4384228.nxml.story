: The study presents initial evidence on the test retest reliability and convergent validity of a computer based hand function assessment protocol in people with rheumatoid arthritis or hand osteoarthritis. The novel tool objectively measures overall task performance during a variety of object manipulation tasks done by tracking a computer based visual target. This allows an innovative method of assessing performance than considering the time taken to complete a task or relying on subjective measures of self-reports on a limited range of objects and tasks covered. In addition, joint pain and stiffness levels before and after a manipulation task are tracked, which is lacking in other hand outcome measures. Performance measures during a broad range of object manipulation tasks relate to many activities relevant to life role participation. Therefore, task performance evaluation of common objects, utensils, or tools would be more valuable to gauge the difficulties encountered in daily life by people with arthritis. Future studies should consider a few revisions of the present protocol and evaluate a number of different objects targeting strength, fine, and gross dexterity based tasks for a broader application of the tool in arthritis populations.
