Incidence of pitting, vary considerably in different types of psoriasis. In clinical practice, toe nail examination is inconvenient. There are inadequate studies which show relation of nail pitting with duration and severity of the disease. The objective was to examine the incidence of finger nail pitting in all types of cutaneous psoriasis and its relation with different variables. This is a clinico-epidemiological study. A careful clinical examination of finger nails was done in day time. Severity of disease was calculated by psoriasis area severity index (PASI). Statistical analysis was done using Microcomputer statistics software (MSTAT). In study group, 621 patients and in control group 350 people were taken. Finger nail pitting was present in 37% (total number was < 20 in 17%; 20-60 in 8% and > 60 in 12%) in study group. In control group, it was present in 10% (in all cases total number was < 20). In < 1 year duration group, pitting was present in 32% of cases, while in > 1 year duration group it was 40.5%. In mild psoriasis, pitting was present in 34.2%, while in severe cases it was 47.6%. Finger nail pitting is an important nail finding in psoriasis and its incidence increases with duration and severity of disease.
