The prevention and management of myocardial ischemia/reperfusion (MI/R) injury is an essential part of coronary heart disease surgery and is becoming a major clinical problem in the treatment of ischemic heart disease. Previous studies by our group have demonstrated that pigment epithelium-derived factor (PEDF) improves cardiac function in rats with acute myocardial infarction and reduces hypoxia-induced cell injury. However, the protective function and mechanisms underlying the effect of PEDF in MI/R injury remain to be fully understood. In the present study, the positive effect of PEDF in MI/R injury was confirmed by construction of the adult Sprague-Dawley rat MI/R model. PEDF reduced myocardial infarct size and downregulated cardiomyocyte apoptosis in the I/R myocardium in this model. In addition, PEDF improved cardiac function and increased cardiac functional reserve in rats subjected to MI/R Injury. To further study the protective effect of PEDF and the underlying mechanisms in MI/R injury, a H9c2 cardiomyocyte hypoxia/reoxygenation (H/R) model was constructed. PEDF was confirmed to decrease H/R-induced apoptosis in H9c2 cells, and this anti-apoptotic function was abolished by pigment epithelium-derived factor-receptor (PEDF R) small interfering (si)RNA. Furthermore, administration of PEDF decreased the levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and malondialdehyde (MDA) in H/R H9c2 cells. Compared with the H/R group, PEDF decreased mitochondrial ROS, increased the mitochondrial DNA copy number, reduced xanthine oxidase and NADPH oxidase activity, as well as RAC family small GTPase 1 protein expression. However, these effects of PEDF were markedly attenuated by PEDF-R siRNA. To the best of our knowledge, the present study is the first to identify the protective effect of PEDF in MI/R injury, and confirm that the antioxidative effect PEDF occurred via inhibition of ROS generation via PEDF-R under MI/R conditions.
