 The patients consisted of 946 females (average, 36.6 years old), and 319 males (average, 34.3 years old). In all TMD patients, 945 had symptoms in the unilateral temporomandibular joint (TMJ) and 320 in the bilateral TMJ. There were significant differences in the distribution of disk positions based on age, regardless of gender, in the unilaterally and bilaterally symptomatic groups; however, the results were not significant in the asymptomatic group. There were significant differences with respect to the distribution of disk positions between males and females in asymptomatic group and in the unilaterally symptomatic group, although the bilaterally symptomatic group did not show significant differences in this regard. As regards the disk positions in the joints of the three groups (asymptomatic group, unilaterally and bilaterally symptomatic groups), there were significant interactive effects of disk positions, regardless of gender. There were statistically significant age-related differences in disk deformities in all symptom groups, regardless of gender, except for in the group of males lacking symptoms in either joint. As regards disk deformities among the three groups studies here, there were significant interactive effects for disk positions, regardless of gender.
