N-myc downstream regulated gene 1 (NDRG1/Cap43/Drg-1) has previously been shown to be dysregulated in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC). In this study, we investigated the role of NDRG1 in the neoplastic progression of ESCC using ectopic gain-of-function and loss-of-function approaches. Stable transfectants of the KYSE30 ESCC cell line with altered NDRG1 levels were generated by lentiviral transduction. Although no measurable effects on in vitro cell proliferation were observed with altered NDRG1 expression, the ectopic overexpression of NDRG1 was positively linked to recognized markers of metastasis, angiogenesis and apoptotic evasion. Accordingly, in the nude mouse xenograft model system, NDRG1 overexpression promoted the in vivo growth of KYSE30 derived xenografts, which could be attributed to the reduced apoptotic and enhanced angiogenic activities associated with this gene. These processes were mediated in part by increased NFÎºB activity in NDRG1 overexpressing cells. Nevertheless, no significant phenotypic changes were observed in response to NDRG1 knock-down, suggesting that this gene might not be essential for the neoplastic progression of ESCC. Taken together, our results suggest that NDRG1 may play positive but dispensable roles in the progression of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma.
