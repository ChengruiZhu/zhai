The ongoing evolution of infectious diseases provides a constant health threat. This evolution can either result in the production of new pathogens, or new strains of existing pathogens that escape prevailing drug treatments or immune responses. The latter process, also known as immune escape, is a predominant reason for the persistence of several viruses, including HIV and hepatitis C virus (HCV), in their human host. As a consequence, the within-host emergence of new strains has been the intense focus of modelling studies. However, existing models have neglected important feedbacks that affects this emergence probability. Specifically, once a mutated pathogen arises that spreads more quickly than the initial (resident) strain, it potentially triggers a heightened immune response that can eliminate the mutated strain before it spreads. Our study outlines novel mathematical modelling techniques that accurately quantify how ongoing immune growth reduces the emergence probability of mutated pathogenic strains over the course of an infection. Analysis of this model suggests that, in order to enlarge its emergence probability, it is evolutionary beneficial for a mutated strain to increase its growth rate rather than tolerate immunity by having a lower immune-mediated death-rate. Our model can be readily applied to existing within-host data, as demonstrated with application to HIV, HCV, and cancer dynamics.
