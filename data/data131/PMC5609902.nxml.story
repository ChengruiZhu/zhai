The identification of human monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) able to neutralize a broad spectrum of primary HIV-1 isolates is highly important for understanding the immune response of HIV-1 infection and developing vaccines and therapeutics. In this study, we isolated a novel human mAb termed Y498 from a phage display antibody library constructed with the PBMC samples of a CRF07_BC-infected Chinese donor whose sera exhibited broadly neutralizing activity. Y498 cross-reacted with diverse Env antigens and neutralized 30% of 70 tested HIV-1 isolates. It efficiently blocked the binding of soluble CD4 to gp120 and competed with the CD4-binding site (CD4bs)-specific mAbs. By combining molecular docking and site-directed mutagenesis, the epitope of Y498 was characterized to contain three antigenic sites on gp120, including the CD4 binding loop in C3, the β23 in C4 and the β24-α5 in C5, which overlap the binding sites of CD4 and CD4bs-directed mAbs (b12, VRC01, A16). Therefore, Y498 is a novel neutralizing human mAb targeting a conformation-dependent CD4bs-based epitope, and its isolation and characterization could provide helpful information for elucidating human immune response to HIV-1 infection and designing effective vaccines and immunotherapeutics.
