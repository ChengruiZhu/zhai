Stroke patients often experience a walking dysfunction caused by decreased mobility, weakened muscular strength, abnormal posture control, and cognitive dysfunction. Anxiety/depression is the most important and prevalent neuropsychiatric complication of stroke survivors. Brain injury and the presence of malnutrition after stroke contribute to metabolic status and clinical outcome of patients. We examined the level of nutrition intake in stroke patients according to their degree of anxiety/depression. The data were obtained from 2013 to 2015 through the Korea National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (KNHANES). Study subjects were categorized to either a group having no problem of anxiety/depression (n = 274) or a group having a problem of anxiety or depression (n = 104). The EuroQoL-5 Dimensions Health Questionnaire (EQ-5D) index score was derived from the first description of an individual health status based on the EQ-5D classification system, including mobility, self-care, usual daily activities, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression. The mean age was 67.4 years in the normal group and 68.0 years in the anxiety or depression group. In the anxiety or depression group, 39.4% were men vs. 53.3% in the normal group. The total energy intake (p = 0.013), riboflavin (p = 0.041), and niacin (p = 0.038) was significantly higher in stroke patients with no anxiety/depression than those in stroke patients with having an anxiety/depression. The group having no problem of anxiety/depression had significantly higher EQ-5D index compared to the group having a problem of anxiety/depression group (p < 0.001) had. The results suggest the association between nutrition intake, usual activities and pain/discomfort status in the stroke patients with having an anxiety/depression.
