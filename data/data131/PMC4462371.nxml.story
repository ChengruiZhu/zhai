Aberrant chemokine stromal cell-derived factor 1 (SDF-1) expression has been shown to be involved in the development and progression of various malignancies. Our present study aims to investigate the clinical and prognostic value of SDF-1 expression and improve risk stratification in patients with gastric cancer. Peritumoral and intratumoral SDF-1 levels were assessed in 220 retrospectively enrolled gastric cancer patients, and their relations with clinicopathological features and clinical outcomes were evaluated. A predictive nomogram was created to refine risk stratification for overall survival of gastric cancer patients. Compared with peritumor tissues, tumor tissues showed decreased SDF-1 expression levels according to TNM stage progression in gastric cancer specimens. Peritumoral SDF-1 expression correlated positively with tumor invasion depth and lymph node metastasis, whereas intratumoral SDF-1 expression associated negatively with tumor size, tumor differentiation, tumor invasion depth, lymph node metastasis, and clinical TNM stage. Moreover, both low peritumoral SDF-1 expression and high intratumoral SDF-1 expression indicated favorable overall survival, and SDF-1 risk derived from the peritumoral/intratumoral SDF-1 expression signature could stratify prognosis of patients with gastric cancer. After backward elimination, SDF-1 risk was identified as an independent prognostic factor for survival. Finally, a predictive nomogram was generated with identified independent prognosticators to assess patient survival at 3 and 5 years following surgery. Conclusively, SDF-1 risk, an identified independent prognostic factor, could be developed into a nomogram with tumor invasion depth, lymph node involvement, and distant metastasis to refine predictive accuracy for survival in patients with gastric cancer after surgical resection.
