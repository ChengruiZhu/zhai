Necrotizing fasciitis (NF) is a rare entity with its subacute form being even rarer. The condition has also been described to occur in the peristomal area in relation to different clinical scenarios. However, it has not been described in the setting of adjuvant chemotherapy where these medications have already been given. While the diagnosis may be delayed or missed due to the subtle symptomatology of the indolent subacute form of NF, another reason for a delayed or missed diagnosis may be the excessive use of tape and the stoma belt around the stomal appliance to prolong the life of the appliance beyond its recommended days of usage due to economic constraints. This, in turn, covers a larger area around the peristomal skin and developing skin changes associated with necrotizing fasciitis. Despite the less aggressive presentation of the subacute form, it may still represent a unique surgical challenge in this setting, as the chemotherapy-induced neutropenia bound to occur a few days after the chemotherapy may expose the patient to serious complications at that time. As such, the surgical plan at the time of presentation may become the determinant of morbidity and mortality. Here, a case is presented of a young patient who underwent abdominoperineal resection for stage III adenocarcinoma of the rectum. He was referred to us on the day of the fourth cycle of adjuvant chemotherapy by the oncology service where he had received part of his chemotherapy regimen. On presentation, he was found to be having significant skin changes in the peristomal area consistent with necrotizing fasciitis despite being clinically stable. The authors present this unique case as a study from which many lessons can be learned. They also explain the thought process behind a well-planned but simple surgical strategy that was implemented with a successful patient outcome. In addition to describing this surgical strategy, the case report is concluded by highlighting some factors that may raise suspicion of this condition and by emphasizing routine history-taking for peristomal symptomatology and a thorough examination of the peristomal site prior to administration of chemotherapy in patients with stomata, as this condition, if overlooked, may lead to a fatal outcome.
