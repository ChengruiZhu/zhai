Individual cell behaviors are controlled by a variety of noise, such as fluctuations in biochemical reactions, protein variability, molecular diffusion, transcriptional noise, cell-to-cell contact, temperature, and pH. Such cellular noise often interferes with signal responses from external stimuli, and such heterogeneity functions in induction of drug resistance, survival, and migration of cells. Thus, heterogeneous cellular responses have positive and negative roles. However, the regulatory mechanisms that produce cellular heterogeneity are unclear. By mathematical modeling and simulations, we investigated how heterogeneous signaling responses are evoked in the EGF signaling pathway and influence the switch-like activation of nuclear ERK. This study demonstrated that cellular heterogeneity of the EGF signaling response is evoked by cell-to-cell variation of particular signaling proteins, such as EGFR, Ras, Raf, and MEK, which act as sensitive nodes in the pathway. These results suggest that signaling responses in individual cells can be predicted from the levels of proteins of sensitive nodes. This study also suggested that proteins of sensitive nodes may serve as cell survival mechanisms.
