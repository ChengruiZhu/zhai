This study was designed to investigate a possible role of the N-terminal tripeptide of insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-I), Gly-Pro-Glu (GPE), physiologically generated in neurons following IGF-I-specific cleavage, in promoting neural regeneration after an injury. Primary cultures of mouse neural stem cells (NSCs), obtained from 13.5 Days post-conception (dpc) mouse embryos, were challenged with either GPE, growth hormone (GH), or GPE + GH and the effects on cell proliferation, migration, and survival were evaluated both under basal conditions and in response to a wound healing assay. The cellular pathways activated by GPE were also investigated by using specific chemical inhibitors. The results of the study indicate that GPE treatment promotes the proliferation and the migration of neural stem cells in vitro through a mechanism that involves the activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) and phosphoinositide 3-kinase PI3K-Akt pathways. Intriguingly, both GPE effects and the signaling pathways activated were similar to those observed after GH treatment. Based upon the results obtained from this study, GPE, as well as GH, may be useful in promoting neural protection and/or regeneration after an injury.
