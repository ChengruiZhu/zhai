In a small praxis/ambulance study we evaluated data of 200 women with chronical recurrent cervical infections and with a cervix dysplasia (CIN 1, CIN 2). who got after the primary therapy a treatment with vitamin D vaginal suppositories (12.500 IU, 3 nights a week, for 6 weeks). We found that - when compared with the lactobacillus vaginal suppositories - the high dose vitamin D vaginal treatment might be more effective. Vitamin D showed very good anti-inflammatory effects. In the survey after six weeks therapy 79% of the women had “less vaginal problems,” “less discharge” and “less problems with the sexual intercourse.” Objectively after six weeks therapy only 7% of the patients still had bacterial and/or fungal vaginal infections that required a treatment. We found that vitamin D is reabsorbed by the vaginal mucosa, but the reabsorption may be individually very different. In the CIN 1 group we found six weeks after treatment good antidysplastic effects, in the CIN 2 group we often found no or only temporary antidysplastic effects. So this vaginal vitamin D treatment method might be an option for the therapy and prevention of chronical cervical infections and maybe of a cervic dysplasia CIN 1 (good antiinflammatory effects, antidysplastic effects). This small study is not representative. We need much bigger studies with much more dates and with a longer follow up.
