CCN2, also known as connective tissue growth factor (CTGF) is a transcriptional target of TGF-β signaling. Unlike its original name (“CTGF”) suggested, CCN2 is not an actual growth factor but a matricellular protein that plays an important role in fibrosis, inflammation and connective tissue remodeling in a variety of diseases, including cancer. In pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma, CCN2 signaling induces stromal infiltration and facilitates a strong tumor-stromal interaction. In many types of cancer, CCN2 overexpression has been associated with poor outcome. CMS4 (Consensus Molecular Subtype 4) is a recently identified aggressive colorectal cancer subtype, that is characterized by up-regulation of genes involved in epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition, TGF-β signaling, angiogenesis, complement activation, and extracellular matrix remodeling. In addition, a high influx of stromal fibroblasts contributes to the mesenchymal-like gene expression profile of this subtype. Furthermore, compared with the other three CMS groups, CMS4 tumors have the worst prognosis. Based on these observations, we postulated that CCN2 might contribute to colorectal cancer progression, especially in the CMS4 subtype. This review discusses the available literature on the role of CCN2 in colorectal cancer, with a focus on the ‘fibrotic subtype’ CMS4.
