Current antimicrobial regimes do not factor the differing ability of drugs to cross the blood-brain barrier. Rifampicin may be more effective at higher doses yet the most recent clinical trial failed to demonstrate survival benefit at 15Â mg/kg/day. Dose finding studies suggest that higher doses still may be safe and more effective. Fluoroquinolones are currently listed as important second-line agents in drug-resistant TBM; however, a survival benefit as a first-line agent has yet to be shown. Linezolid may be a promising antimicrobial with good central nervous system penetrance. Dexamethasone reduces mortality in HIV-uninfected individuals yet evidence for its use in HIV co-infection is lacking. Aspirin has anti-inflammatory and anti-thrombotic properties. Small studies have demonstrated efficacy in reducing stroke but further research is required to better understand its effect on controlling the host inflammatory response. Discovery of genetic polymorphisms may direct individualized immune therapies and mediators of the innate immune response may provide targets for the development of novel therapies. There is at present no significant evidence base to guide management of hydrocephalus in HIV co-infection.
