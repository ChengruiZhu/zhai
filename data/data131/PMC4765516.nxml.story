The etiology of Parkinsonâ€™s disease (PD) is still unclear, but mutations in PRKN have provided some biological insights. The role of PRKN mutations and other genetic variation in determining the clinical features of PD remains unresolved. The aim of the study was to analyze PRKN mutations in PD and controls in the Polish population and to try to correlate between the presence of genetic variants and clinical features. We screened for PRKN mutations in 90 PD patients and 113 controls and evaluated clinical features in these patients. We showed that in the Polish population 4% of PD patients had PRKN mutations (single or with additional polymorphism) while single heterozygous polymorphisms (S167N, E310D, D394N) of PRKN were present in 21% of sporadic PD. Moreover, 5% PD patients had more than one PRKN change (polymorphisms and mutations). Detected PRKN variants moderately correlated with PD course and response to L-dopa. It also showed that other PARK genes (SNCA, HTRA2, SPR) mutations probably may additionally influence PD risk and clinical features. PRKN variants are relatively common in our Polish series of patients with PD. Analysis of the PRKN gene may be useful in determining clinical phenotype, and helping with diagnostic and prognostic procedures in the future.
