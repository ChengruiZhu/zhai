Out of 641 cases reviewed (79% male; mean age 14.3 years), 408 (64%) fractures were sustained during sports, most frequently football (25%), hockey (18%), soccer (12%), snowboarding (12%) and skiing (9%). Other common mechanisms of injury were falls sustained outside of athletic activity (19%) and motor vehicle accidents (5%), with similar distribution of mechanism and similar rates of associated injuries seen within the operative (5%) and non-operative (6%) treatment groups. Greater numbers of clavicle fractures were seen annually over the study period. Among the overall cohort, 82% were treated non-operatively, while 18% were treated surgically, with increasing percentage of patients undergoing surgery over the course of the study period. The mean age was higher in the operative group (15.5 years) than the nonoperative group (14.1 years)(p<0.001). Fifty-eight documented complications occurred in 46 patients (7.2%), were significantly more common in the operative (16%) group than the non-operative (5%) group (p<0.001), and were more common in older patients (p=0.007). Only 1 case of nonunion occurred in each treatment group (p=0.56). The rate of symptomatic implants was 13% in the operative group (leading to plate removal in 9% cases), while the rate of symptomatic malunion was 2% in the nonoperative group. Refracture was significantly more common in the nonoperative group (3%) than the operative group (2%) (p=0.03). Refracture in the non-operative group most commonly occurred in the period before complete healing had occurred. Of the 2 cases of refracture in the operative group, 1 case was a peri-implant fracture and 1 case occurred over 1 year following plate removal. No infections were reported in either group. One of the nonoperative symptomatic malunion patients developed thoracic outlet syndrome requiring osteotomy, which led to symptom resolution. One of the operative patients developed contralateral recurrent laryngeal and hypoglossal neuropraxia (Tapiaâ€™s syndrome), causing vocal cord paralysis, tongue deviation, and hoarseness, with near complete resolution at the time of most recent follow up, four months post-operatively.
