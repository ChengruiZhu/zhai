Water is the major component of cells and tissues, and the movement of water across the cell membrane is a fundamental property of life. Until the discovery of the first water channel, aquaporin, it was long assumed that the transport of water was due to simple diffusion through the lipid bilayer membrane that encloses cells. Aquaporin (AQP) molecules were first discovered in the human uterus in 1994, and since then several studies have investigated these channels in the female reproductive system. The expressions of AQPs have been proven in the reproductive system. Their levels are altered during the implantation process, both in the uterus and the fetal cells, and participate in the control of the flow of amniotic fluid. They seem to be very important for the normal placental functions. AQPs are present during parturition, participating in the control of pregnant myometrial contractions and cervical ripening. However, most of the physiological and regulatory roles of AQPs are not clarified in the reproductive tract. Furthermore, no satisfactory knowledge is available about their sensitivities to different drugs. AQP-selective ligands may contribute to the development of new drug candidates and the therapy of several reproductive disorders.
