Six cadaveric specimens of hemi-pelvis with proximal femur were obtained for the study from musculoskeletally normal donors (mean age: 54.5 yrs, range 46-61 yrs). Full pelvis specimens were first skeletonized and potted onto a custom mounting jig secured at the iliac wings using bolts and dental cement. The mounting jigs consisted of a metal bracket system which allowed the hemipelvis to rotate anteriorly and posteriorly. A pullout handle with a 6-axis load cell (AMTI, Watertown, MA) on board was fixed in the lateral aspect of the femur, 1-inch below the greater trochanter. Manual pullout was performed along the axis of femoral neck, while suction force induced by the negative pressured measured by the load cell was recorded at a rate of 100 Hz. The width of the intact labrum was measured with a ruler at the 12 o’clock position. Each specimen was tested under three labrum conditions: intact, torn, and reconstructed. The intact specimen was tested first. The labrum was then released directly off of the bony acetabular rim from the 11 o’clock position to the 2 o’clock position using a scalpel. The pull out strength was tested again. Finally, labral reconstruction was performed using five suture anchors evenly spaced within the span of the tear, and secured with a single simple suture per anchor. Pull out test was performed the third time using the same protocols. Prior to each of three pull out tests, light mineral oil (Johnson & Johnson baby oil) was applied to the surfaces of the femoral head and acetabulum to simulate the lubricating effect of synovial fluid. The peak suction forces from the three stages were derived from the load cell measurement based on the handle orientation. Peak suction force from the torn and reconstruction stages were also normalized with respect to the native stage and repeated measure ANOVA was used to test the differences.
