Tooth decay, more commonly known as dental cavities, is the most common chronic disease worldwide, both in children and in adults. It consists in the destruction of tooth enamel, the outer layer of the teeth, by acid-producing bacteria. Enamel is the hardest tissue in the body, comprised of 96% minerals. However, it contains a small fraction of proteins that is important for its resistance to mechanical stress and decay. Here we show that this protein fraction contains a set of structural proteins (K6a, K6b, K6c, K16 and K17) that belong to the keratin family and are present specifically in the skin of the palms and soles, as well as in nails. We further show that common genetic mutations that affect the composition of these proteins lead to an increased number of cavities. Rare mutations in these keratins lead to a human disease called pachyonychia congenita (PC) and characterized by severe nail malformations and lesions in the skin of the palms and soles. Analysis of wisdom teeth from one of these patients showed that their enamel exhibited structural defects. These results demonstrate that these keratins are important components of tooth enamel and that common genetic variants in the genes that encode them influence tooth decay risk in the general population.
