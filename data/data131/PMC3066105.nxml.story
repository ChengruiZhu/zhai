Thirty SD rats weighing 250-300 g were equally randomized to three groups: Control group, where the rats were treated with thoracotomy only; IR group, where the rats were treated with ischemia for 60 min and reperfusion for 180 min; and IPost group, where the rats were treated with 3 cycles of transient IR just before reperfusion. The extent of myocardial infarction, LDH and CK activities were measured immediately after treatment. Myocardial apoptosis was detected by TUNEL assay. The myocardial tissue was collected after IR or IPost stimulation to evaluate the miRNAs expression level by miRNA-microarray and quantitative real-time RT-PCR. Real-time PCR was conducted to identify changes in mRNA expression of apoptosis-related genes such as Bcl-2, Bax and Caspase-9 (CASP9), and Western blot was used to compare the protein expression level of CASP9 in the three groups. The miRNA mimics and anti-miRNA oligonucleotides (AMO) were transferred into the cultured neonatal cardiomyocytes and myocardium before they were treated with IR. The effect of miRNAs on apoptosis was determined by flow cytometry and TUNEL assay. CASP9, as one of the candidate target of miR-133a, was compared during IR after the miR-133a mimic or AMO-133a was transferred into the myocardium.
