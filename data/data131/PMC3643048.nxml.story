Segmental odontomaxillary dysplasia is characterized by variability of its clinical and radiological features, and may mimic other fibro-osseous lesions. We describe the case of a segmental odontomaxillary dysplasia in a 12-year-old male comprising of dermal, gingival, bony, and dental abnormalities. He presented with left midfacial diffuse hyperkeratotic erythematous lesion, ipsilateral hypopigmentation of upper lip with indistinct vermilion border, left-sided facial swelling, unilateral maxillary enlargement and ipsilateral failure of eruption of permanent teeth. Radiographic imaging showed abnormal bony trabeculation, impacted and missing teeth. Histopathologic findings showed characteristic features of segmental odontomaxillary dysplasia. We herein report a case of this rare unusual anomaly, review the literature, and propose a new clinical classification based on the limited number of previously reported cases in an attempt to categorize the clinical variants of the condition which might be helpful when treatment options are to be considered. Clinicians should be aware of its presence when encountering patients presenting with a facial cutaneous lesion especially when it is associated with facial asymmetry and unresponsive to treatment.
