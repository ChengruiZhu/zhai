Diallyl trisulfide (DATS), the major active ingredient in garlic, has been reported to confer cardioprotective effects. However, its effect on myocardial ischemia-reperfusion (MI/R) injury in diabetic state and the underlying mechanism are still unknown. We hypothesize that DATS reduces MI/R injury in diabetic state via AMPK-mediated AKT/GSK-3β/HIF-1α activation. Streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats received MI/R surgery with or without DATS (20mg/kg) treatment in the presence or absence of Compound C (Com.C, an AMPK inhibitor, 0.25mg/kg) or LY294002 (a PI3K inhibitor, 5mg/kg). We found that DATS significantly improved heart function and reduced myocardial apoptosis. Additionally, in cultured H9c2 cells, DATS (10μM) also attenuated simulated ischemia-reperfusion injury. We found that AMPK and AKT/GSK-3β/HIF-1α signaling were down-regulated under diabetic condition, while DATS markedly increased the phosphorylation of AMPK, ACC, AKT and GSK-3β as well as HIF-1α expression in MI/R-injured myocardium. However, these protective actions were all blunted by Com.C administration. Additionally, LY294002 abolished the stimulatory effect of DATS on AKT/GSK-3β/HIF-1α signaling without affecting AMPK signaling. While 2-methoxyestradiol (a HIF-1α inhibitor) reduced HIF-1α expression without affecting AKT/GSK-3β signaling. Taken together, these data showed that DATS protected against MI/R injury in diabetic state by attenuating cellular apoptosis via AMPK-mediated AKT/GSK-3β/HIF-1α signaling. Its cardioprotective effect deserves further study.
