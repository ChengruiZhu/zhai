We have studied the localization of three abundant cellular proteins which are substrates for tyrosine protein kinases in virally transformed chicken embryo fibroblasts. The primary location of each substrate is unaltered by transformation with Rous sarcoma virus (RSV). The tyrosine-phosphorylated species is localized with the nonphosphorylated species. Two of the proteins, of about 46,000 and 28,000 daltons, have a similar location. They are present in the high speed supernatant of cells homogenized in hypotonic buffer, and are soluble in nonionic detergent. The third protein, of about 39,000 daltons, is particulate when cells are homogenized in hypotonic buffer containing divalent cations, but approximately 30% is free in the high- speed supernatant when divalent cations are absent. This protein appears to be associated with the detergent-insoluble matrix when adherent cells are gently lysed in nonionic detergent in situ, but is soluble when the same cells are extracted with nonionic detergent in suspension. This suggests that one of the proteins are tightly associated with detergent-insoluble cytoskeletal structures, unlike the RSV transforming protein itself, which is the main tyrosine protein kinase known to be active in RSV-transformed cells.
