The eukaryotic cell division cycle is driven by fluctuating activities of cyclin-dependent kinases (Cdk), which are activated and inactivated by several mechanisms, including cyclin synthesis and degradation. Although the cell cycle is driven by many different Cdk-cyclin complexes in present-day eukaryotes, experiments with fission yeast demonstrate that a single Cdk-cyclin complex is sufficient to order the events of the cell cycle. Surprisingly, a Cdk-inhibitory mechanism working through tyrosine phosphorylation of the kinase subunit, which is essential for modern fission yeast, becomes dispensable in the Minimal Cdk Network (MCN). By developing both deterministic and stochastic models of the MCN, we show that a different inhibitory mechanism based on a stoichiometric Cdk inhibitor (called Rum1) can compensate for the lack of inhibitory Cdk phosphorylation in the MCN. We also demonstrate that this compensation mechanism is suppressed in wild-type fission yeast cells by the other Cdk-cyclin complexes, which down-regulate the level of Rum1. These predictions of computational modelling are supported by our experimental data. Our work provides new insights into the interplay between the structure of the control network and the physiology of the cell cycle.
