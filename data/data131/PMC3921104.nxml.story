 CPEB is called Orb2, and its amyloid-like oligomers are critical for the persistence of long-lasting memories. Amyloid formation is often unregulated and stochastic in nature, and the amyloid state is usually dominant and self-sustaining. However, to serve as a substrate for long-lasting memory, the amyloid-like oligomerization of Orb2 must be regulated in a space-, time-, and stimulus-specific manner. Orb2 has two protein isoforms: Orb2A, which is present only in low abundance, and Orb2B, which is the abundant form. Orb2A is important for oligomerization as well as memory persistence. Previous studies suggested that Orb2A may act as a seed to induce oligomerization of the constitutive Orb2B isoform. Therefore, the availability of Orb2A protein would be an important determinant of Orb2 oligomerization. Here we have analyzed how Orb2 conversion to the oligomeric state is regulated. We find that Orb2A is a very unstable protein and that phosphorylation-dephosphorylation of this isoform via canonical neuronal signaling modules can regulate Orb2A stability, and thereby its abundance. We also show that Tob, a known regulator of CPEB-mediated translation, acts as a stabilizer for Orb2A and triggers Orb2 oligomerization. These observations suggest that amyloid formation can be regulated in a dynamic manner by controlling the availability of the seeding Orb2A protein.
