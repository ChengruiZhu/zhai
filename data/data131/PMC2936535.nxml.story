Natural selection sorts through the variability generated by mutation and biases evolution toward fitter outcomes. However, because mutation is itself not entirely random it can also bias the direction of evolution independently of selection. For instance, it is often assumed that the extreme variation observed in nucleotide content among bacteria (from ∼20% to ∼80% GC) is predominantly driven by extreme differences in mutational biases towards or away from GC. Here, we show that bacterial lineages that recently developed clonal, pathogenic lifestyles evolve under weak selection and that polymorphisms in these bacteria can be used as a fair proxy for mutational spectra. We analyze large sequence datasets from five clonal pathogens in four diverse bacterial clades spanning most of the range of genomic nucleotide content. We find that, surprisingly, mutation is AT-biased in every case to a very similar degree and in each case it is dominated by transitions from C/G to T/A. This demonstrates that mutational biases are far les variable than previously assumed and that variation in bacterial nucleotide content is not due entirely to mutational biases. Rather natural selection or a selection like process such as biased gene conversion strongly affect nucleotide content in bacteria.
