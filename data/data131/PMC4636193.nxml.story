Pancreatic cancers frequently invade the portomesenteric veins. Venous resection during pancreaticoduodenectomy with curative intent is more common now than it was in the past. Most venous resections can be repaired primarily, but some require vascular grafts. Here, we describe the use of an autologous parietal peritoneum graft instead of vascular grafts for repairing a superior mesenteric vein (SMV) defect. Pylorus-preserving pancreaticoduodenectomy combined with en bloc resection of the SMV lateral wall was performed in a 70-year-old woman with cancer of the pancreatic head. The SMV defect was 2 cm long and its width was half the SMV circumference. The defect was covered with a 3 × 2 cm parietal autologous peritoneum graft obtained from the left subcostal area and using running 6/0 polypropylene suture. Tension-free patching was performed, and we retained slight bulging of the graft. Her postoperative course was uneventful. She was discharged on Day 11 after computed tomography confirmed the patency of the SMV, despite slight narrowing. She was well after 10 months of follow-up. Autologous parietal peritoneum grafts can be used for repairing partial venous defects during pancreaticoduodenectomy. They are effective and are easy, fast, and cheap to obtain.
