Genes determine the structure of proteins through transcription and translation in which an RNA copy of the gene is made (mRNA) and then translated to make the protein. Cellular protein levels reflect the relative rates of mRNA synthesis and degradation, which are subject to multiple layers of controls. Mechanisms also exist to ensure the quality of each mRNA. One quality control mechanism called nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD) triggers the rapid degradation of mRNAs containing coding errors that would otherwise lead to the production of non-functional or potentially deleterious proteins. NMD occurs in yeasts, plants, flies, worms, mice, and humans. In humans, NMD affects the etiology of genetic disorders by affecting the expression of genes that carry disease-causing mutations. Besides quality assurance, NMD plays another role in gene expression by controlling the abundance of hundreds of normal mRNAs that are devoid of coding errors. In this paper, the authors used DNA arrays to monitor the relative decay rates of all mRNAs in budding yeast and found a subset where decay rates were dependent on NMD. Many of the corresponding proteins perform related functional roles affecting both the structure and behavior of chromosomes and the structure and integrity of the cell surface.
