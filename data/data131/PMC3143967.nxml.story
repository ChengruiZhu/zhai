 species in 2 patients, while the bacterial culture was negative in the third. All of them underwent immediate arthroscopic debridement and lavage with continuous irrigation, as well as antibiotic treatment. The results were evaluated with physical and radiographic examination, functional testing, KT-2000, Lysholm and Tegner scales. The infection was successfully eradicated without further surgical treatment and the ligament graft was retained in all patients. Follow-up, at an average of 33 months, revealed that the patients had full symmetric knee range of motion and no effusion. The average Lysholm score was 91 points. In the patient with a lower subjective score, radiographs demonstrated patellofemoral joint-space narrowing, which is most probably in correlation with his anterior knee pain problems and lower activity level. The 134 N KT-2000 arthrometer side-to-side differences averaged 13 mm. Their performance in the single-legged hop test gave excellent results. The goals of treatment for septic arthritis after anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction are, primarily, to protect the articular cartilage and, secondly, to protect the graft. Through early diagnosis and prompt treatment, the infection can be successfully eradicated, with stability of the knee and full range of motion achieved.
