Lumbar disc disease (LDD) is a common musculoskeletal disorder, caused by degeneration of intervertebral discs of the lumbar spine and is one of the most common musculoskeletal disorders affliction in adult. There is growing evidence that LDD has strong genetic determinants. We analyze whether the IL4 and IL6 gene polymorphism is related to LDD in Chinese Han population. The participants were 498 with LDD and 463 without LDD. IL4 and IL6 gene polymorphism were determined by Sequenom MassARRAY. We found that SNPs rs1800796(OR = 1.29, 95% CI, 1.07 – 1.57, p = 0.009), rs1524107(OR = 1.28, 95% CI, 1.05 – 1.55, p = 0.013), rs2069840 (OR = 1.39, 95% CI, 1.03 – 1.89, p = 0.033) in IL6 gene were significantly associated with LDD risk at a 5% level. In addition, genetic models found IL4 gene (rs2243250) were associated with LDD. In this study, we analyzed and associated SNPs of IL4 and IL6 with LDD risk. In summary, four variations (rs1800796, rs1524107, rs2069840, rs2243250) of the selected candidate SNPs were associated with susceptibility to LDD in our study. The results of this study have the guiding significance in clinical work in the future in the treatment of lumbar disc herniation patients, not one-sided that the symptoms of low back pain only from mechanical oppression.
