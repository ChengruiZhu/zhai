MG-conjugated chitosan nanoparticles (Nano-MG) were prepared by conjugating the carbonyl group of MG with the amino group of chitosan polymer (Schiffâ€™s base formation). Nano-MG were characterized in detail using the dynamic light scattering method, zeta potential measurement, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, and transmission electron microscopic analysis. Amount of MG anchored to Nano-MG, stability of Nano-MG, and in vitro release of MG from Nano-MG were estimated spectrophotometrically. Ehrlich ascites carcinoma (EAC) cells, human breast cancer cell line HBL-100, and lung epithelial adenocarcinoma cell line A549 were used as test systems to compare Nano-MG with bare MG in vitro. Cytotoxicity to EAC cells was evaluated by the trypan blue dye exclusion test, and cell viability of HBL-100 and A549 cells were studied using 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl) 2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay. Apoptosis of HBL-100 cells was assessed by flow cytometry and confocal microscopy. In vivo studies were performed on both EAC cells inoculated and also in sarcoma-180-induced solid tumor-bearing Swiss albino mice to assess the anticancer activity of Nano-MG in comparison to bare MG with varying doses, times, and administrative routes.
