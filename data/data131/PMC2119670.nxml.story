HeLa cells arrested in prometaphase were pulse-labeled with [35S]methionine and chased in the absence of nocodazole to allow passage through mitosis and into G1. Transport of histocompatibility antigen (HLA) molecules to the medial- and trans-Golgi cisternae was measured by monitoring the resistance to endoglycosidase H and the acquisition of sialic acid residues, respectively. Transport to the plasma membrane was measured using neuraminidase to remove sialic acid residues on surface HLA molecules. The half-time for transport to each of these compartments was about 65-min longer in cells progressing out of mitosis than in G1 cells. This delay was only 5-min longer than the half-time for the fall in histone H1 kinase activity suggesting that inactivation of the mitotic kinase triggers the resumption of protein transport. The half-time for reassembly of the Golgi stack, measured using stereological procedures, was also 65 min, suggesting that both transport and reassembly are triggered at the same time. However, since reassembly was complete within 5 min, whereas HLA took 25 min to reach the medial-cisterna, we can conclude that the Golgi stack has reassembled by the time HLA reaches it.
