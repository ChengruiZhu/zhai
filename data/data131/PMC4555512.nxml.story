 Fifteen skiers (19 knees) and 10 snowboarders (10 knees) were analyzed. There were 13 males and 12 females, with a mean subject age of 22.6 ± 4.45 years. The rate of RTS in the X-Games following ACL reconstruction was 80% overall (20/25 subjects). The rate of RTS in winter X-Games following ACL reconstruction in skiers was 87% (13/15 subjects) and in snowboarders was 70% (7/10 subjects). The rate of RTS in winter X-Games following ACL reconstruction in males and females was 85% (11/13 subjects) and 75% (9/12 subjects), respectively. The rate of revision ACL reconstruction due to ACL tear following primary ACL reconstruction was 4% (1/25 subjects). There were more left- than right-sided tears (18 vs 11). Skiers and snowboarders competed in the X-Games for 3.84 ± 2.73 and 3.40 ± 2.84 years prior to ACL reconstruction and 2.56 ± 2.06 and 7.29 ± 3.30 years after ACL reconstruction, respectively. Skiers earned 22 medals prior to ACL reconstruction (9 gold, 5 silver, 8 bronze) and 24 medals after ACL reconstruction (16 gold, 2 silver, 6 bronze). Snowboarders earned 7 medals prior to ACL reconstruction (4 gold, 1 silver, 2 bronze) and 19 medals after ACL reconstruction (7 gold, 7 silver, 5 bronze).
