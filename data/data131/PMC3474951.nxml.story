3 mm diameter dentin cores were extracted from bovine teeth, mounted in acrylic rods, and ground and polished. Sound and demineralized (in 10 mL unstirred 50% citric acid (pH = 1.2) for two minutes) specimens were divided into four groups (N=6) corresponding to treatments with either water (control group) or non-contact Vanish® 5% NaF White Varnish with tri-calcium phosphate (3M ESPE). For the non-contact varnish group, one 0.50 ml unit-dose was applied to acrylic rods and positioned in the same stopper as three dentin specimens. The four groups were then cycled in a regimen consisting of three rounds of one-hour treatments with each round followed by immersion in a three-minute static acid challenge (0.3% citric acid, pH = 3.8). For each one-hour treatment immersion the test groups were immersed in distilled water. The specimens were thoroughly rinsed with distilled water after each treatment and after each acid challenge. After the last challenge, specimens were rinsed with distilled water and immersed in artificial saliva (AS) overnight. All treatments, acid challenges and immersion in AS solution were performed in an incubator set at 37°C. After three days, the specimens were assessed using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS).
