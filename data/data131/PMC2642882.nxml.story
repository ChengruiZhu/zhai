The Tau protein, which plays a central role in the progression of Alzheimer disease, is normally expressed in nerve axons, where it stabilizes microtubules (MTs), supports the outgrowth of axons, and modulates the transport of vesicles and organelles along MTs. In Alzheimer disease, Tau becomes excessively phosphorylated, loses its ability to bind to MTs, and aggregates into intracellular abnormal protein deposits. Many efforts have been made over the years to understand Tau structure as a way to understand Tau function and its mechanisms of action, but these efforts have primarily used traditional biochemistry and molecular biology approaches and therefore have addressed structure and function at a relatively primitive level. Here, we show that it is possible to characterize the structure and dynamics of 441-residue Tau at single residue resolution using nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. NMR spectroscopy demonstrates that 441-residue Tau is highly dynamic in solution with a distinct domain character and an intricate network of transient long-range contacts important for pathogenic aggregation. Moreover, the single-residue view provided by the NMR analysis reveals unique insights into the interaction of Tau with MTs.
