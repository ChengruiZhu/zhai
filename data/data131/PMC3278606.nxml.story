Antiretroviral therapy alters lipid metabolism in HIV-infected patients. However, interpreting the impact of HIV infection on lipid metabolism is difficult because of various associated factors, including antiretroviral drugs and demographic characteristics. A few studies have associated HIV infection with lipid metabolism in antiretroviral-naïve HIV-infected patients. Because there were no data in this regard from Japan, the present study examined the impact of HIV infection, as well as demographic and clinical features, on lipid metabolism in antiretroviral-naïve HIV-infected patients in Japan. We performed a cross-sectional study to examine the impact of HIV disease, demographic and clinical characteristics on lipid metabolism among 168 HIV-infected Japanese men who were antiretroviral naïve and who did not have hemophilia, including patients who took medication for dyslipidemia. The mean age of the patients was 45.7 years; 0.6% of the patients took medication to dyslipidemia. The mean CD4 lymphocyte count was 289/μL, the mean baseline log10 HIV viral load was 4.2 HIV-1 RNA copies/mL, and 22% of the patients had a history of AIDS-defining events. A higher HDL-C concentration was associated with a higher CD4 lymphocyte count (
