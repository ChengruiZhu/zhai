Nocturnal heart rate variability (HRV) is thought to reflect healthy recovery function of the autonomic nervous system. Although exercise is recommended for health promotion, exercise itself decreases HRV. We studied acute effect of daytime exercise on nocturnal HRV in 5 healthy adults (age, 22–40 years; 2 female subjects) without regular exercise habit. Using a treadmill, they performed 30-min walking at 4 km/hr and 30-min running at 9 km/hr from 11 a.m. on different days at an interval of 2 weeks. On these days and a day without exercise (control), Holter electrocardiograms were recorded from 9 a.m. for 24 hr. The amplitudes of low-frequency (LF, 0.04–0.15 Hz) and high-frequency (HF, 0.15–0.45 Hz) components of HRV were measured continuously by complex demodulation and were averaged over periods of 11:00–11:30 a.m., 3 hr after going to bed, and time in bed at night. Exercise intensities of the walking and running were at 10% to 44% and 55% to 67% of heart rate reserve, respectively. During exercise, heart rate increased and LF and HF amplitudes decreased with exercise intensity. Nocturnal heart rate and LF and HF amplitude, however, showed no consistent changes with exercise intensity and their averages on the days of walking and running did not differ significantly from those of the control day. In conclusion, 30-min walking and running exercises performed in the morning had no significant acute effects on nocturnal heart rate or HRV.
