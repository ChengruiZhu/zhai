This study examines the role of L-selectin in monocyte adhesion to arterial endothelium, a key pathogenic event of atherosclerosis. Using a nonstatic (rotation) adhesion assay, we observed that monocyte binding to bovine aortic endothelium at 4°C increased four to nine times upon endothelium activation with tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α. mAb-blocking experiments demonstrated that L-selectin mediates a major part (64 ± 18%) of monocyte attachment. Videomicroscopy experiments performed under flow indicated that monocytes abruptly halted on 8-h TNF-α–activated aortic endothelium, ∼80% of monocyte attachment being mediated by L-selectin. Flow cytometric studies with a L-selectin/IgM heavy chain chimeric protein showed calcium-dependent L-selectin binding to cytokine-activated and, unexpectedly, unactivated aortic cells. Soluble L-selectin binding was completely inhibited by anti–L-selectin mAb or by aortic cell exposure to trypsin. Experiments with cycloheximide, chlorate, or neuraminidase showed that protein synthesis and sulfate groups, but not sialic acid residues, were essential for L-selectin counterreceptor function. Moreover, heparin lyases partially inhibited soluble L-selectin binding to cytokine-activated aortic cells, whereas a stronger inhibition was seen with unstimulated endothelial cells, suggesting that cytokine activation could induce the expression of additional ligand(s) for L-selectin, distinct from heparan sulfate proteoglycans. Under flow, endothelial cell treatment with heparinase inhibited by ∼80% monocyte attachment to TNF-α–activated aortic endothelium, indicating a major role for heparan sulfate proteoglycans in monocyte–endothelial interactions. Thus, L-selectin mediates monocyte attachment to activated aortic endothelium, and heparan sulfate proteoglycans serve as arterial ligands for monocyte L-selectin.
