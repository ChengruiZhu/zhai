When we acquire a new motor skill—for example, learning how to play a musical instrument—new synaptic connections are induced in a distributed network of brain areas. There is ample evidence from human neuroimaging studies for this high plasticity of the brain, but what about the spinal cord, the main link between the brain and the peripheral nervous system? Literature on animal models has recently hinted that spinal cord neurons can learn during various conditioning paradigms. However, human learning models by tradition assume that the spinal cord acts as a passive relay of information from the cortex to the muscles. In this study, we simultaneously acquired functional images of both the brain and the cervical spinal cord through functional magnetic resonance imaging, and we provide evidence for local spinal cord plasticity during a well-studied motor learning task in humans. We also demonstrate a dynamic change in the interaction of the brain and spinal cord regions over the course of motor learning. The present findings have important clinical implications for rehabilitation of patients with spinal cord injuries, as they demonstrate that this part of the central nervous system is much more plastic than it was assumed before.
