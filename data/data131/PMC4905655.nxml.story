A human cell lineage tree describes the entire developmental dynamics of a person starting from the zygote and ending with each and every extant cell. Fundamental open problems in biology and medicine are in fact questions about the human cell lineage tree: its structure and its dynamics in development, growth, renewal, aging, and disease. Consequently, a method to know the human cell lineage tree would allow resolving these problems and enable a leapfrog advance in human knowledge and health. Recent advancements in single-cell genomics have the potential to uncover various properties of the human cell lineage tree and thus promote our understanding of various biological phenomena. In this paper we present a computational framework along with specific results, which enable to understand what can be achieved using the limitations of current technologies and predict future capabilities based on future improvements. This approach can serve as a valuable tool for researchers who plan to perform lineage experiments both in designing and optimizing the actual experimental needs and predicting the costs and limitations of the plan. This work can also help researchers focus on developing what is needed for future advancements.
