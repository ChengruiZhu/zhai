Phenotypes are determined by the expression of genes, the environment, and the interaction of gene expression and the environment. However, a complete understanding of the inheritance of and genome-wide regulation of gene expression is lacking. One approach, called expression quantitative trait locus (eQTL) mapping provides the opportunity to examine the genome-wide inheritance and regulation of gene expression. In this paper, we conducted high-throughput sequencing of gene transcripts to examine gene expression in the shoot apex of a maize biparental mapping population. We quantified expression levels from 28,603 genes in the population and showed that the vast majority of genes exhibited the expected pattern of Mendelian inheritance. We genetically mapped the expression patterns and identified genomic regions associated with gene expression. Notably, we detected gene expression patterns that exhibited non-Mendelian inheritance. These included 145 genes that exhibited expression patterns in the progeny that were similar to only one of the parents and 210 genes with unexpected presence/absence expression patterns. The findings of non-Mendelian inheritance underscore the complexity of gene expression and provide a framework for understanding these complexities.
