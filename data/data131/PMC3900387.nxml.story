Understanding how differences in cellular regulation lead to phenotypic differences between species remains an open challenge in evolutionary genetics. The extensive phosphorylation data currently available allows to compare the human and mouse phosphoproteomes and to measure changes in their phosphoregulation. We found a general conservation of phosphorylation sites between these two species. However, a fraction of sites are conserved at the sequence level (the same amino acid is present in both species) but differ in their phosphorylation status. These sites represent candidate sites that have the potential to explain differences between human and mouse signalling networks that do not depend on the divergence of orthologous residues. Furthermore, we identified several sites where to a phosphorylation site in one species corresponds a non-phosphorylatable residue in the other one. These cases represent clear differences in protein regulation. Recent studies suggest that phosphorylation sites can shift position during evolution, leading to configurations in which pairs of divergent phosphorylation sites are functionally redundant. We identified more than 100 putative such cases, suggesting that divergence in amino acid does not necessarily imply functional divergence when comparing phosphoproteomes. Overall, our study provides new key concepts and data for the study of how regulatory differences may be linked to phenotypic ones at the network level.
