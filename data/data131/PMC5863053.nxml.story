 embryonic week. In an experimental study, targeted knockdown of cardiac troponin T in the chick was performed at day 3, after the heart tube has formed. Morpholino treatment of gene TNNT2 at this stage led to the development of left ventricular diverticula (LVD) in the primitive left ventricular wall. Diagnosis of left ventricular aneurysms (LVA)/LVD can be made after exclusion of coronary artery disease, local or systemic inflammation or traumatic causes as well as cardiomyopathies. Clinically, most of LVA and LVD are asymptomatic or may cause systemic embolization, congestive heart failure, valvular regurgitation, ventricular wall rupture, ventricular tachycardia or sudden cardiac death. Diagnosis is established by imaging studies (echocardiography, magnetic resonance imaging or left ventricular angiography) visualizing the structural changes and accompanying abnormalities. Mode of treatment has to be individually tailored and depends on clinical presentation, accompanying abnormalities and possible complications, options include surgical resection (especially in symptomatic patients), anticoagulation after systemic embolization, radiofrequency ablation or implantation of an implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) in case of symptomatic ventricular tachycardias, and occasionally combined with class I- or III-antiarrhythmic drugs. Cardiac death occurs usually in childhood, is significantly more frequent in LVA patients and caused by congestive heart failure in most of the cases, whereas patients diagnosed with LVD died more frequently from rupture of the LVD.
