. A t-test was conducted on the differentially methylated sites. Functional enrichment analysis of DEGs was performed through the Database for Annotation, Visualization and Integrated Analysis. The genes corresponding to the differentially methylated sites were obtained by the annotation files of methylation chip platform. A total of 182 DEGs and 3,902 differentially methylated sites were identified in HCA. In addition, 238 enriched GO terms, including organic acid metabolic process and carboxylic acid metabolic process, and 14 KEGG pathways, including chemical carcinogenesis, were identified. Furthermore, 12 DEGs were identified to contain differentially methylated sites, among which, 8 overlapped genes, including pregnancy zone protein and solute carrier family 22 member 1 (SLC22A1), exhibited inverse associations between gene expression levels and DNA methylation levels. The DNA methylation levels may be potential targets of HCA. The present study revealed that the 8 overlapped genes, including annexin A2, chitinase 3-like 1, fibroblast growth factor receptor 4, mal, T-cell differentiation protein like, palladin, cytoskeletal associated protein, plasmalemma vesicle associated protein and SLC22A1, may be potential therapeutic targets of HCA.
