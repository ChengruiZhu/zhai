Cyclic nucleotide-gated (CNG) channels mediate the passage of cations through the cytoplasmic membrane. They are involved in sensory transduction and cellular development in the rod and cone photoreceptors, as well as in brain, kidney, heart and other cells, and are linked to achromatopsia and other rare genetic diseases. We used a hybrid modeling approach, combining comparative modeling and estimates of evolutionary conservation and couplings, to model the structure of a human cone CNG channel. The channel comprises a membrane domain that allows ion passage, and a regulatory cytosolic domain that binds cyclic nucleotides. The structure of each domain was modeled by homology on the basis of a suitable template. Our hybrid approach allowed us to evaluate the model structure, as well as to determine the conformations of regions where the templates overlapped and presented conflicting structural evidence. We then conducted normal mode analysis to reveal global motions of the channel. We suggest that the main mode of motion, counter-rotation of the membrane and cytosolic domains around the membrane normal, is associated with channel gating. Such rotational motion induces minimal perturbation to the lipid membrane, which could explain why the motion is observed in other types of channels.
