Reports on the relationship between the lncRNA H19 rs217727 polymorphism and the risk of cancer in the Chinese population have been inconsistent. Therefore, we performed a meta-analysis to evaluate this association, by searching the Embase, PubMed, Web of Science, Wanfang, and CNKI databases. Four case-control studies with 3,157 cases and 3,564 controls were selected for this meta-analysis. The odds ratios with 95% confidence intervals were examined using the random effect model. Allelic (A vs. G), dominant (AA + GA vs. GG), recessive (AA vs. GA + GG), and additive (AA vs. GG) genetic models were used to determine the association. Overall, no significant association was observed between the rs217727 polymorphism and cancer susceptibility in any of the four genetic models. Sensitivity analysis revealed that the results were stable in the allelic and dominant genetic models, but those from the recessive and additive models were unstable, which should be treated with caution. Our meta-analysis suggests that the lncRNA H19 rs217727 polymorphism might not be associated with overall cancer risk. However, well-designed, large-scale studies with different ethnic populations need to be conducted in the future to elucidate the potential association.
