Germline HOXB13 G84E mutation (rs138213197) has been described associated with prostate cancer (PCa) susceptibility but results of different studies are inconsistent. We conducted this meta-analysis to evaluate the specific role of this mutation. Relevant available studies were identified by searching the databases Pubmed, Embase and Web of Science. Odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated to measure the strength of the association. Subgroup analysis were performed to evaluate the specific role of rs138213197 in disease aggressiveness, diagnostic age and family history. Furthermore, trial sequential analysis (TSA) was conducted for the first time to estimate whether the evidence of the results is sufficient. Our results indicated that significant increased PCa susceptibility was associated with rs138213197 compared with non-carriers (OR = 3.38, 95% CI: 2.45–4.66). Besides, in subgroup analysis, HOXB13 G84E variant was obviously associated with early onset (OR = 2.90, 95% CI: 2.24–3.75), affected relatives (OR = 2.60, 95% CI 2.19–3.10) and highly aggressive disease (OR = 2.38, 95% CI 1.84–3.08). By TSA, the findings in the current study were based on sufficient evidence. Therefore, our results indicated that the G84E mutation in HOXB13 gene might increase susceptibility to PCa.
