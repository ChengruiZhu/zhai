This population-based study was designed to estimate and compare the risk of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) between patients with primary Sjögren’s syndrome (SS) and non-SS patients during a 10-year follow-up period. This is a retrospective cohort study. Data were obtained from the Taiwan’s National Health Insurance Research Database. We identified 4463 primary SS patients and 22,315 non-SS patients; patients were matched by sex, age, and the year of index use of health care. Each patient was studied to identify the subsequent manifestation of AD. Cox proportional hazard regression was used to study the subsequent manifestation of AD, and Kaplan-Meier survival curves were used to compare survival probability. During the 10-year follow-up period, 7 primary SS and 13 non-SS patients developed AD. During the 10-year follow-up period, the risk of AD was 2.68-fold higher in the primary SS cohort with an overall adjusted hazard ratio (HR) of 2.69 (95% CI 1.07–6.76), after adjusting for demographics and comorbidities. Within the 10-year period, patients with primary SS showed a 2.69-fold increased risk of developing AD. This risk increases with time, and the relative risk of AD is higher in older patients with primary SS.
