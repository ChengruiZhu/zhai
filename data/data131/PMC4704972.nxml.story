Adults aged 16 years or older undergoing valve or combined coronary artery bypass graft and valve surgery at one of three UK cardiac centers (Bristol, Hull, or Leicester) are randomly allocated in a 1:1 ratio to either a standard algorithm for optimizing tissue oxygenation during CPB that includes a fixed transfusion threshold, or a patient-specific algorithm that incorporates cerebral NIRS monitoring and a restrictive red blood cell transfusion threshold. Allocation concealment, Internet-based randomization stratified by operation type and recruiting center, and blinding of patients, ICU and ward care staff, and outcome assessors reduce the risk of bias. The primary outcomes are cognitive function 3 months after surgery and infectious complications during the first 3 months after surgery. Secondary outcomes include measures of inflammation, organ injury, and volumes of blood transfused. The cost effectiveness of the NIRS-based algorithm is described in terms of a cost-effectiveness acceptability curve. The trial tests the superiority of the patient-specific algorithm versus standard care. A sample size of 200 patients was chosen to detect a small to moderate target difference with 80% power and 5% significance (two tailed).
