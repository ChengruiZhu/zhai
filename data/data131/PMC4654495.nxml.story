Investigating how a set of genes might collectively work together to perform various cellular processes has become a routine part of many biological analyses. In such analyses, genes of interest are compared to sets of genes annotated to various biological functions (or pathways) defined within carefully curated databases. One of the most comprehensive and widely used resources of this type is the Gene Ontology (GO) database. The Gene Ontology database is comprised of two important elements: (1) the ontology itself, which provides a controlled vocabulary of terms describing genetic function and also specifies how these functional terms are related to one another via a hierarchical structure; and (2) the set of annotations made using GO that connect individual genes to different functional terms. In our paper we investigate a method for organizing functional terms that results from connecting terms based on shared gene annotations. We find that this alternate classification has an organization that is highly distinct from the Gene Ontology hierarchy, challenging the way we think about the relationships between different biological functions. Finally, we show that these alternate collections of terms are highly associated with published cancer gene signatures, demonstrating that this alternative organization of biological functions can highlight important relationships between cellular processes and has the potential to lead to new insights and discoveries.
