Robotic-assistance has the potential to improve the accuracy of bony resections, when performing femoral osteochondroplasty in the treatment of cam-type femoroacetabular impingement (FAI). The purpose of this study was to determine the accuracy of robotic-assisted femoral osteochondroplasty and compare this to a conventional open, freehand technique. We hypothesized that robotic-assistance would increase the accuracy of femoral head-neck offset correction in cam FAI. Sixteen identical sawbones models with a cam-type impingement deformity were resected by a single surgeon, simulating an open femoral osteochondroplasty. Eight procedures were performed using an open freehand technique and eight were performed using robotic-assistance, through the creation of a three-dimensional haptic volume. A desired arc of resection of 117.7° was determined pre-operatively using an anatomic plan. Post-resection, all 16 sawbones were laser scanned to measure the arc of resection, volume of bone removed and depth of resection. For each sawbone, these measurements were compared with the pre-operatively planned desired resection, to determine the resection error. Freehand resection resulted in a mean arc of resection error of 42.0 ± 8.5° compared with robotic-assisted resection which had a mean arc of resection error of 1.2 ± 0.7° (
