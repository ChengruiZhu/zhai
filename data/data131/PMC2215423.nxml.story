The Stern equation, a combination of the Langmuir adsorption isotherm, the Boltzmann relation, and the Grahame equation from the theory of the diffuse double layer, provides a simple theoretical framework for describing the adsorption of charged molecules to surfaces. The ability of this equation to describe the adsorption of divalent cations to membranes containing brain phosphatidylserine (PS) was tested in the following manner. Charge reversal measurements were first made to determine the intrinsic 1:1 association constants of the divalent cations with the anionic PS molecules: when the net charge of a PS vesicle is zero one-half of the available sites are occupied by divalent cations. The intrinsic association constant, therefore, is equal to the reciprocal of the divalent cation concentration at which the mobility of a PS vesicle reverses sign. The Stern equation with this association constant is capable of accurately describing both the zeta potential data obtained with PS vesicles at other concentrations of the divalent cations and the data obtained with with vesicles formed from mixtures of PS and zwitterionic phospholipids. Independent measurements of the number of ions adsorbed to sonicated PS vesicles were made with a calcium-sensitive electrode. The results agreed with the zeta potential results obtained with multilamellar vesicles. When membranes are formed at 20 degrees C in 0.1 M NaCl, the intrinsic 1:1 association constants of Ni, Co, Mn, Ba, Sr, Ca, and Mg with PS are 40, 28, 25, 20, 14, 12, and 8 M-1, respectively.
