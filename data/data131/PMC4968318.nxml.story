There were 86 scapulae in 79 patients that met inclusion criteria. Mean age at time of surgery was 33 years old (range 12-65). A partial scapulectomy and bursectomy was performed in 79 scapulae, with 7 having bursectomy alone. Mean duration from onset of symptoms to surgery was 3.8 years (range 90 days-16.6 years). One patient died in the follow-up period from unrelated causes, and 6 patients refused to participate. Of the remaining 72 scapula, 8/72 (11%) failed and underwent a revision procedure at a mean of 309 days (SD+283 days). Of those that met inclusion criteria and did not require revision surgery, 86% (55/64) returned surveys with a mean follow-up of 3.4 years (range 2-7 years). There was a significant improvement following surgery in SF-12 PCS (p<0.001), SF-12 MCS (p=0.043), ASES (p<0.001), and QuickDASH (p=0.001) scores. Overall, median patient satisfaction was 7 out of 10 (range 1 to 10). Increasing age correlated with decreased postoperative SF-12 PCS (r= -.372;p=0.007), ASES (r= .279;p=0.043), and QuickDASH (r=.350;p=0.011) scores, while gender was not found to be associated with outcomes. A lower preoperative SF-12 MCS score was found to correlate with lower postoperative ASES scores (r=.395;p=0.011), while longer duration of symptoms prior to surgery also correlated with lower postoperative ASES (rho=-.296; p=0.027) and QuickDASH (rho=.315;p=0.019) scores.
