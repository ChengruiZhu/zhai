Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is a form of sleep-disordered breathing characterized by periods of partial or complete obstruction of the upper airway during sleep, resulting in oxygen desaturations. Symptoms and risk factors for OSA are of particular importance in the management of OSA patients in the perioperative setting. The present study collected data regarding the intraoperative airway management of OSA patients and their course in the postanesthesia care unit (PACU) over a six-month period. A total of 86 patients underwent general anesthesia, 63 of whom were intubated by direct laryngoscopy. Of these, 43% were classified as a grade 1 view by direct laryngoscopy, 43% were grade 2 and 14% were classified as grade 3. Apnea events or periods of desaturation in the PACU were observed in 27% of cases. Length of stay was significantly longer for cases in which PACU nurses had indicated that OSA had affected the individualsâ€™ postoperative course of treatment. Overall, OSA patients had an increased frequency of grade 3 views compared with the general population, and adjuncts were commonly used to help secure the airway in OSA patients. Symptomatic OSA patients placed increased demands on the PACU in terms of length of stay and hospital resources.
