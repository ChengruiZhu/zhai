Posture can be defined as the form of the body when sitting, walking, or standing. There would be no problem if muscles interact in harmony with musculoskeletal system or nervous system. Posture analysis is crucial for clinical assessments in physical medicine and rehabilitation. However, studies into this issue are limited. In this study, the relationship between static standing balance and anthropomorphic features in healthy subjects was investigated. The study was carried out with a total of 240 students at Baskent University (116 females, 124 males) aged between 18 and 25 years. Type of balance of the subjects was determined with lateral posture analysis. Additionally, muscle shortness tests, subcutaneous fat thickness, and waist and thigh circumference were measured. As the results of lateral posture analysis, 107 subjects (71 males, 36 females) were detected to have anterior balance, 89 (41 males, 48 females) posterior balance, and 44 (12 males, 32 girls) neutral balance. Values of waist circumference, thigh circumference, and waist/thigh ratio were compared with all three balance types. A statistically significant difference was detected between these values in the subjects who had anterior balance (
