In 5â€“10% of fracture patients, the bone fractures do not heal in the normal healing period (delayed healing) or do not heal at all (non-union). In order to investigate the causes of impaired healing and design potential treatment strategies, we have used a combined experimental and computational approach. More specifically, large bone defects were analyzed in mouse models and simulated by a previously published computational model. After showing that the predictions of the computational model match the observations of the experimental model, we have used the computational model to investigate the underlying mechanisms of action. In particular, the results indicated that the new blood vessels do not reach the central fracture zone in time due to the large defect size, which leads to insufficient oxygen delivery, increased cell death and disrupted bone healing. The healing, however, could be rescued by adequate blood vessel ingrowth from the overlying soft tissues. Moreover, potential treatment strategies were designed based on the influence of these soft tissues. In conclusion, this study demonstrates the potential of a combined experimental and computational approach to contribute to the understanding of pathological processes like the impaired bone regeneration in large bone defects and design future treatments thereof.
