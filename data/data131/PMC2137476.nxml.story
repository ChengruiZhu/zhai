 flagellin, a protein antigen known to contain significant contamination with somatic (O) antigen. Single cells from secondarily immunized rats were tested for production of anti-H and anti-O antibodies by previously described and newer techniques. Positive antibody producers were transferred onto clean dry slides by micromanipulation, and autoradiographs were performed. When rats had received tritiated thymidine 1 hour before killing, labeling of antibody-forming cells was taken to imply that the cell was preparing for further mitotic division. It was found that on the 2nd and 3rd day of a secondary response, many of the antibody-producing cells in the nodes (chiefly plasmablasts) were incorporating tritiated thymidine. At the height of the cellular response, however, at 4 and 5 days, the majority of active antibody producers (chiefly mature plasma cells) were incapable of DNA synthesis. There appeared to be an inverse relationship between the antibody-forming and DNA-synthesizing capacities of the cell population under study; as more of the cells studied formed detectable antibody, fewer of them incorporated the DNA precursor. The age of plasma cells was also studied. Animals were killed at the height of the cellular immune response, having previously received an injection of tritiated thymidine 1 to 48 hours before killing;
