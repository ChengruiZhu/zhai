-Methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) is a DNA repair protein, the loss of MGMT expression was commonly known due to hypermethylation of CpG islands in its promoter region. Overexpression of p53 protein may be associated with downregulated MGMT expression in brain tumors. The aims of this study were to investigate the role of MGMT expression loss and its correlation with p53 overexpression in endometrial cancers. MGMT and p53 expression was examined in formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissues from 36 endometrial cancer cases using immnunohistochemical staining. The loss of MGMT expression was detected in 11 (30.6%) out of the 36 endometrial cancers and p53 immunoreactivity was detected in 23 (63.9%) out of the 36 endometrial cancers. Ten (90.9%) of the 11 cases with negative MGMT immunoreactivity showed positive p53 expression, so the loss of MGMT expression was significantly associated with the p53 overexpression (P=0.03). These findings suggest that the loss of MGMT expression may be one of factors capable of p53 overexpression in endometrial cancer. Further studies are needed to define the relation between MGMT and p53 for examining the mechanisms of tissue-specific MGMT expression.
