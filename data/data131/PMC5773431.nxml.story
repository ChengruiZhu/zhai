The authors report the diffusion tensor tractography (DTT) findings of three pediatric patients with gait dysfunction and corticoreticular tract (CRT) disruption. All three patients showed unilateral trunk instability, but they did not show any spasticity or weakness of the distal extremities. Clinical evaluation of trunk instability using a Trunk Control Measurement Scale (TCMS) revealed that the more affected side had a lower score than the contralateral side. DTT showed disrupted CRTs in hemispheres contralateral to the hemiparetic sides, which were associated with unilateral proximal instability, although conventional MRI showed no abnormal lesion explaining the hemiplegic symptom. Compared to the results in age-matched controls, these three patients had decreased values of fractional anisotropy (FA) and tract volumes (TV) of the affected CRTs, and these values were also decreased compared to those in the contralateral side. On the other hand, values of FA and TV of the corticospinal tracts on the ipsilateral and contralateral sides were only marginally different. In conclusion, diffusion tensor imaging can be helpful for investigating the state of the CRT in pediatric patients with trunk instability and gait dysfunction.
