A central tenet of immunology is that cellular responses that protect us from pathogens result from molecular recognition of foreign compounds (antigens). The role of self-antigens in immune activation is less clear. We show here that an endogenous lipid called lyso-phosphatidylcholine (LPC) is recognized as an antigen by a subpopulation of human T lymphocytes, called natural killer T (NKT) cells, and specifically by the best-studied subgroup of these cells known as invariant NKT (iNKT) cells. NKT cells have attracted the interest of immunologists because they can potently influence the outcome of diverse immune responses; for example, they can promote bacterial clearance and tumor rejection, and they can also quell autoimmune disease pathology. Previous studies indicated that NKT cells are activated by self-antigens, but the identity of the relevant compounds remained unclear. Our finding that LPC is a self-antigen for iNKT cells suggests that these lymphocytes are attuned to highly conserved lipid signaling pathways that are fundamental to normal physiological processes and are markedly up-regulated during inflammation. Thus, these results provide a new molecular basis for understanding how iNKT cells contribute to a wide variety of immune responses.
