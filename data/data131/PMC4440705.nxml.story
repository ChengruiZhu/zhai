Mitochondria are responsible for most energy generation in human and animal cells. Loss or pathological alteration of mitochondrial function is a hallmark of many age-related diseases. Mitochondrial dysfunction may be a central and conserved feature of the ageing process. As part of quality control (QC), mitochondria are continually replicated and degraded. Furthermore, two mitochondria can fuse to form a single mitochondrion, and a mitochondrion can divide (fission) into two separate organelles. Despite this QC, mutant mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) molecules have been observed to accumulate in cells with age which may lead to mitochondrial dysfunction. In this study, we created a detailed mathematical model of mitochondrial QC and performed model simulations to investigate circumstances allowing or preventing the accumulation of mutant mtDNA. We found that more frequent fusion-fission could quicken mutant mtDNA clearance, but only when mitochondria harboring a high fraction of mutant molecules were strongly prevented from fusing with other mitochondria and selectively degraded. Otherwise, faster fusion-fission would actually enhance the accumulation of mutant mtDNA. Our results suggested that the expansion of mutant mtDNA likely involves a decline in the selectivity of mitochondrial degradation and fusion. This insight might open new avenues for experiment and possible development of future therapies.
