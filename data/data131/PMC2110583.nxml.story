In rapidly growing hyphae of Saprolegnia ferax, all nuclei contain arrays of kinetochore microtubules, which suggests that the nuclei are all in various phases of mitosis, with no apparent interphase. In prophase nuclei, kinetochore microtubules form a single, hemispherical array adjacent to the centrioles. This array separates into two similar arrays after centriole replication. The two arrays form by separation of the initial group of microtubules, with no kinetochore replication. During metaphase, between 6.5 and 85% of the kinetochores occur as amphitelic pairs, with a slight tendency for pairing to increase as the spindle elongates. 100% pairing has never been observed. The interkinetochore distance in these pairs is consistently similar to or approximately 0.17 microns. Throughout metaphase and early anaphase, there is extensive and increasing diversity in kinetochore microtubule length, so that a true metaphase plate has not been found. During metaphase, anaphase, and telophase, kinetochore numbers vary considerably, with a mean of similar to or approximately 30 per half spindle. A number of artefactual causes for this variability were examined and discarded. Thus, these results are accepted as real, suggesting either variable ploidy levels in the coenocytic hyphae or kinetochore replication during mitosis.
