Directing attention to a part of visual space produces patterns of "brainwaves" or neuronal oscillations in the human visual cortex (the part of the brain at the back that processes incoming information from the eyes); oscillations at low frequencies are believed to help the brain block out irrelevant or distracting information, whereas high-frequency oscillations signal processing of relevant information. The instructions to increase or decrease these oscillations likely originate in the front part of the brain. In this study, we investigated the structural "highways"—bundles of white matter—that connect the front and back of the brain together. Not only did we show that these highways are asymmetric—i.e., some participants have a larger fiber bundle in the left hemisphere of their brains, and some in the right—we also showed that these asymmetries predicted whether subjects were better able to control the neuronal oscillations in their left or right hemispheres. This, in turn, predicted whether the participants were faster in detecting targets in the right or left half of the screen. Thus, we showed that these structural highways are important in helping the brain pay attention to parts of visual space.
