It was shown that the progressive growth of the immunogenic meth A fibrosarcoma in its semisyngeneic host results in the generation of concomitant immunity to the growth of a tumor implant. The generation of immunity occurred between days 6 and 9 of tumor growth and was associated with the generation of sensitized T cells that were capable, on passive transfer, of causing regression of a 3-d tumor in gamma- irradiated recipients. After day 9 of tumor growth, concomitant immunity and the T cells able to passively transfer it were progressively lost, and this was associated with the generation of splenic suppressor T cells able to suppress the expression of adoptive immunity against an established tumor in T cell-deficient ( TXB ) recipients. The T cells that passively transferred concomitant immunity were shown to be of the Ly-1-2+ phenotype, in contrast to the T cells that transferred suppression, which were shown with the same reagents to be Ly-1+2-. The results are consistent with the hypothesis that the progressive growth of an immunogenic tumor results in the generation of Ly-1-2+-sensitized effector T cells that fail to reach a number sufficient to destroy the tumor because their generation is down- regulated by tumor-induced Ly-1+2- suppressor T cells.
