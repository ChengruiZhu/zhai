How do we decide whether a traffic light signals stop or go? Perceptual decision making research investigates how the brain can make these simple but fundamentally important decisions. Current consensus states that the brain solves this task simply by accumulating sensory information over time to make a decision once enough information has been collected. However, there are important, open questions on how exactly this accumulation mechanism operates. For example, recent experimental evidence suggests that the sensory processing receives feedback about the ongoing decision making while standard models typically do not assume such feedback. It is also an open question how people compute their confidence about their decisions. Furthermore, current decision making models usually consider only a single decision and stop modelling once this decision has been made. However, in our natural environment, people change their decisions, for example when a traffic light changes from green to red. Here, we show that one can explain these three aspects of decision making by combining two already existing modelling techniques. This resulting new model can be used to derive novel testable predictions of how the brain makes perceptual decisions.
