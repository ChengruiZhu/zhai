Proteins and their interactions form a proteinâ€“protein interaction network, where the proteins are the nodes and the interactions are the edges. Genomic studies show that deleting a highly connected protein node (hub) is more likely to be lethal to an organism than deleting a lowly connected node (non-hub), a phenomenon known as the centrality-lethality rule. Because hubs are more important than non-hubs in organizing the global network structure, the centrality-lethality rule is widely believed to reflect the significance of network architecture in determining network function, a key notion of systems biology. In this work, the authors proposed a small fraction of randomly distributed essential interactions, each of which is lethal to an organism when disrupted. Under this scenario, a hub is more likely to be essential than a non-hub simply because the hub has more interactions and thus a higher chance to engage in an essential interaction. Hence, the centrality-lethality rule is explained without the involvement of network architecture. Using yeast data, the authors provided empirical evidence supporting their hypothesis. Their proposal and results challenge a prevailing view in systems biology and provide a new perspective on the role of network structures in biology.
