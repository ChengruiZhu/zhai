Infectious disease outbreaks in human, animal and plant populations can have devastating consequences. Where and how much control should be deployed are difficult questions to answer. However, mathematical modelling is increasingly used by policy-makers to underpin these–sometimes contentious–decisions. When to manage disease is often viewed as more straightforward. Surely interventions should be introduced quickly, in an attempt to contain the outbreak as soon as possible? In practice, there are a number of unavoidable uncertainties at the beginning of any outbreak, such as whether or not the initial cases will lead to a major epidemic, as well as uncertainty about the exact transmissibility of the pathogen. We show that waiting to resolve these uncertainties before starting interventions can lead to less costly outbreaks, even though waiting means there might then be a larger outbreak to control. We have developed a novel algorithm that can be used in real-time during emerging outbreaks to decide when and how to introduce control. While for human diseases it might be controversial for policy-makers to recommend delaying interventions, for pathogens of plants or animals such a strategy will often be optimal and ethically justifiable. Our work shows how this approach might be implemented in practice.
