For many animals, including rats, accurate spatial memory over relatively large areas is important in order to find food and shelter. Just as unique points in time can be efficiently represented by combinations of repeating elements like hours, days, and months, points in space can be represented as combinations of elements that repeat at different spatial scales. Just such a code has been identified in the brains of rats and it shows an intriguing triangular spacing of encoded locations. Two different explanations have been developed as to what general mechanism in the brain might be able to generate this unusual code. However, to date there is not conclusive experimental evidence indicating whether either of the two explanations is correct. Here we show in detail that one of the explanations, called oscillatory interference, has specific requirements regarding the amount of variability in the system that implements it. We then report data experimentally examining candidate systems to evaluate their levels of noise. The large amount of noise that we find presents a challenge to the currently suggested biological implementations of oscillatory interference, but it does not provide support for the alternative explanation.
