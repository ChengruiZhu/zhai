Glottic cancers discovered at an early stage (T1-T2) can be treated with either radiotherapy or surgery. The aim of our study is to analyse survival and functional results of supra-cricoid partial laryngectomy (SCPL) with crico-hyoido-epiglottopexy (CHEP) as surgical treatment for glottic carcinoma with anterior commissure involvement. We performed a retrospective study (1996-2013) which included patients who underwent SCPL-CHEP for glottic squamous cell carcinoma with involvement of the anterior commissure. Before surgery, all patients underwent staging including head, neck and chest CT-scan with contrast injection as well as suspension laryngoscopy under general anaesthesia. A total of 53 patients were included. The median follow-up period was 124 months. Tumour resection was complete in 96.2% of cases. The overall, specific and recurrence-free survival rates at 5 years were, respectively, 93.7%, 95.6% and 87.7%. The average period of hospitalisation was 18 days. The average time elapsed before decannulation and before restoration of oral feeding were 15 and 18 days, respectively. SCPL-CHEP is an important option for laryngeal surgical preservation. It allows adequate disease control as well as good functional results as long as the indications are well respected and the surgical techniques are mastered.
