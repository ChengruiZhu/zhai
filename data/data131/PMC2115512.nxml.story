We have obtained and characterized a genomic clone of SEC14, a Saccharomyces cerevisiae gene whose product is required for export of yeast secretory proteins from the Golgi complex. Gene disruption experiments indicated that SEC14 is an essential gene for yeast vegetative growth. Nucleotide sequence analysis revealed the presence of an intron within the SEC14 structural gene, and predicted the synthesis of a hydrophilic polypeptide of 35 kD in molecular mass. In confirmation, immunoprecipitation experiments demonstrated SEC14p to be an unglycosylated polypeptide, with an apparent molecular mass of some 37 kD, that behaved predominantly as a cytosolic protein in subcellular fractionation experiments. These data were consistent with the notion that SEC14p is a cytosolic factor that promotes protein export from yeast Golgi. Additional radiolabeling experiments also revealed the presence of SEC14p-related polypeptides in extracts prepared from the yeasts Kluyveromyces lactis and Schizosaccharomyces pombe. Furthermore, the K. lactis SEC14p was able to functionally complement S. cerevisiae sec14ts defects. These data suggested a degree of conservation of SEC14p structure and function in these yeasts species.
