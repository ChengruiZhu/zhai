Cytolytic T lymphocytes (CTL) specific for the virus-induced and leukemia-associated Friend, Moloney, Rauscher (FMR) antigen are easily detected in the spleens of primary and secondary stimulated H-2b or H- 2d mice. They react, respectively, with H-2Db + FMR and H-2Kd + FMR; Dd and Kb never being involved. On the other hand, recombinant (KbDd) mice are relatively low responders that produce CTL only after secondary stimulation. Competition and blocking experiments with monospecific anti-H-2 antibodies have demonstrated that on the same H-2b tumor cells, C57BL/6 (H-2b) lymphocytes recognize Db + FMR, whereas B10.A(5R) lymphocytes recognize Kb + FMR, the restriction cannot, therefore be explained by a specific association of viral molecules with certain H-2 products. The CTL response of (B10 X 5R)F1 hybrids is (a) easily detected in primary reaction, the high responder anti-FMR phenotype being dominant and (b) directed against Db + FMR, F1 mice being low responder against Kb + FMR like the B10 parent. These results suggest that a D region-associated immune response gene controls the cell- mediated anti-FMR reaction, the best available H-2 + FMR antigenic association being chosen by CTL precursors.
