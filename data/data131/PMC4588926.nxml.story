192 patients with a total of 206 OCD lesions fit the inclusion criteria. No OCD lesions were found in 2-5 year olds. 53.4% of lesions were right-sided, 46.6% left-sided. The medial femoral condyle was the most commonly affected location with 63.6% of the knee OCD lesions, followed by the lateral femoral condyle with 32.5%. Lesions of the femoral trochlea, patella, and lateral tibial plateau represented less than 4% of the total combined. No OCD lesions were found in the 2-5 year-olds. The incidence of knee OCD for patients aged 6-19 was 9.6 per 100,000 for all patients, and 15.7 and 3.3 per 100,000 for males and females, respectively. Group B represented the vast majority of OCD, with an incidence of 21.8 per 100,000 in 12-19 year olds versus 8.7 in group A. Females in group A and B had an incidence of 4.6 and 13.3 per 100,00, respectively, while males had an incidence of 12.5 and 30.1 per 100,00 for group A and B, respectively. The overall male/female ratio for knee OCD was 3.7/1. 33.8% of all lesions progressed to surgery. Lesion location did correlate with progression to surgery, with rare trochlear lesions and tibial lesions more likely to undergo surgery (100%, 100%) than lateral and medial femoral condyle lesions (40.3% and 28.7%) and patellar lesions (33.3%).
