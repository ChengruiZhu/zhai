Neurodegenerative diseases are often associated with dysfunction in protein quality control. The endoplasmic reticulum (ER), a key site for protein synthesis, senses stressful conditions by activating the unfolded protein response (UPR). Here we report the creation of a novel mouse model where GRP78/BiP, a major ER chaperone and master regulator of UPR, is specifically eliminated in the Purkinje cells (PCs). GRP78 depleted PCs activate UPR including induction of GRP94, PDI, CHOP and GADD34, feedback suppression of eIF2Î± phosphorylation and apoptotic cell death. In contrast to current models of protein misfolding where abnormal accumulation of ubiquitinated protein is prominent, cytosolic ubiquitin staining is dramatically reduced in GRP78 null PCs. Ultrastructural evaluation reveals that the ER shows prominent dilatation with focal accumulation of electron-dense material within the ER. The mice show retarded growth and severe motor coordination defect by week 5 and cerebellar atrophy by week 13. Our studies uncover a novel link between GRP78 depletion and reduction in cytosolic ubiquitination and establish a novel mouse model of accelerated cerebellar degeneration with basic and clinical applications.
