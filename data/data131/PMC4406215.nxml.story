Adioponectin was higher in female than in male children, and in Group 1 than in Group 2. Generally, adiponectin was lower in Asian as compared to Italian and American children. These tendencies remained even after adjustment for body mass index (BMI) or waist circumstance (WC). Among older children (Group 2), resistin was higher in female than in male children. Significant correlations by non-parametric univariate correlation coefficients and Spearman’s rank correlation coefficients were found between adiponectin and homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR), and fasting serum insulin levels in young Japanese, Italian, and American female children(p < 0.01, p < 0.05, p < 0.05, respectively). Correlations between serum adiponectin and HOMA-IR were also found among older male Italian, American, and Thai children (p < 0.05, p < 0.001, p < 0.001, respectively). In multiple regression analysis by forced entry method, adiponectin correlated with HOMA-IR in Italian and American male children, and in all older female children regardless of country of origin. There was no correlation between resistin and markers of insulin resistance in children from any of the countries.
