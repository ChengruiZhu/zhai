Arrhythmogenic Right Ventricular Cardiomyopathy (ARVC) is a relatively under-recognized hereditary cardiomyopathy. It is characterized pathologically by fibro-fatty infiltration of right ventricular (RV) myocardium and clinically by consequences of RV electrical instability. Timely intervention with device therapy and pharmacotherapy may help reduce the risk of arrhythmic events or sudden cardiac death. Here, we describe a classic case of a young adult with ARVC and a brief literature review. The patient presented with exertional palpitations and ARVC was suspected after his routine electrocardiogram (EKG) revealed symmetric T wave inversions and possible epsilon waves in right precordial leads. Subsequent work up showed fatty infiltration of RV myocardium on cardiac magnetic resonance imaging and inducible ventricular tachycardia from the right ventricle during electrophysiologic study. Those findings confirmed the diagnosis of ARVC and warranted treatment with implantable cardioverter defibrillator. It is always exciting to encounter rare pathological entities with classic clinical findings, especially when they present as a diagnostic challenge.We were able to provide correct diagnosis and management, thereby preventing the potentially lethal consequences. Therefore, it is important to recognize the possible EKG findings of ARVC and to know when to pursue further investigations and to implement therapies.
