The concentration of adiponectin, a hormone which is secreted from adipose tissue, is inversely correlated with body fat mass. This hormone has anti inflammatory and anti atherogenic properties. Its concentration reduces in metabolic syndrome and cardiovascular diseases. This study reviews the evidence on the relationship between serum adiponectin concentration and lipid profile. In this study former clinical trials, cross sectional and prospective studies have been reviewed. The PubMed search engine has been used to find related research for the topic by considering dyslipidemia, total cholesterol (TC), high and low density protein (HDL and LDL), triglyceride (TG), lipid profile (LP) and adiponectin as the key words. Finally, 25 articles were recruited to review in the present article. Serum adiponectin level was positively correlated with plasma HDL cholestrol concentrations. There was a significant inverse relationship between plasma triglyceride and serum adiponectin. An inverse correlation between very low density lipoprotein (VLDL) and LDL levels and adiponectin was reported from the studies. So, Adiponectin has an important role in the metabolism of lipid profile including HDLc.
