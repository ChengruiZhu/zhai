Calmodulin, the ubiquitous calcium-activated second messenger in eukaryotes, is an extremely versatile molecule involved in many biological processes: muscular contraction, synaptic plasticity, circadian rhythm, and cell cycle, among others. The protein is structurally organised into two globular lobes, joined by a flexible linker. Calcium modulates calmodulin activity by favoring a conformational transition of each lobe from a closed conformation to an open conformation. Most targets have a strong preference for one conformation over the other, and depending on the free calcium concentration in a cell, particular sets of targets will preferentially interact with calmodulin. In turn, targets can increase or decrease the calcium affinity of the calmodulin molecules to which they bind. Interestingly, experiments with the tryptic fragments showed that most targets have a much lower affinity for the N-lobe than for the C-lobe. Hence, the latter predominates in the formation of most calmodulin-target complexes. We showed that a relatively simple allosteric mechanism, based the classic MWC model, can capture the observed modulation of both the isolated C-lobe, and intact calmodulin, by individual targets. Moreover, our model can be naturally extended to study how the calcium affinity of a single pool of calmodulin is modulated by a mixture of competing targets
