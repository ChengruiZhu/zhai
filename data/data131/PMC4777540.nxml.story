Individual recognition via scent is critical for many aspects of behavior including parental care, competition, cooperation and mate choice. While animal scents can differ in a huge number of dimensions, recent work has shown that only some specialized semiochemicals in scent marks are behaviorally relevant for individual recognition. How is individuality in specialized semiochemical blends produced and maintained in populations? At the extremes, individuality may depend on either a plethora of semiochemical isoforms or on combinatorial variation in a small number of shared isoforms across individuals. Analyzing the major urinary protein (MUP) pheromone blends of a wild population of house mice, we find evidence in favor of a combinatorial diversity model for the production and maintenance of individuality. Balancing selection maintains MUP proteins at moderate frequencies in the population, though interactions with the pheromone receptors appear to limit the extent of pheromone diversity in the system. By contrast, differential transcription of proteins greatly increases individuality in pheromone blends with balancing selection maintaining diversity in promoter regions associated with gene expression patterns. Selection maintaining combinatorial diversity in a limited set of behaviorally important semiochemicals may be a widespread mechanism generating and maintaining individuality in scent across taxa.
