Hidradenocarcinomas are rare, aggressive adnexal tumors of sweat gland origin that demonstrate a high potential for local recurrence, metastasis and poor outcome. These neoplasms can derive from preexisting clear cell hidradenomas, but more commonly appear de novo with the molecular events responsible for the pathogenesis currently unknown. Molecular markers of pathogenesis as well as effective forms of adjuvant chemotherapy are missing due to the lack of accurate diagnosis, paucity of cases and confusion with other visceral solid tumors. Here, we report a 37-year-old man who presented with a rapidly growing, painful palpable mass located in the right inguinal area. The patient was a nonsmoker, did not consume alcohol and had a medical history remarkable only for a lower abdominal superficial skin lesion in the same area that had been excised 11 years earlier. Although initially slow growing, the lesion eventually expanded, was surgically excised and was diagnosed as a hidradenoma. There was no family history of malignancy and the patient had not experienced any constitutional symptoms. We probed the immunohistochemical status and detected negative staining for the estrogen, progesterone and Her2 receptors, while strong, diffuse nuclear staining was seen in the majority of cells consistent with
