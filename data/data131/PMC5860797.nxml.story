Blood platelets are the second most numerous component of blood after red blood cells. Their main function is to stop bleeding upon vessel wall injury. Contact with foreign substances, normally absent inside the bloodstream, leads to platelet activation. After this, platelets adhere to the damaged surface and to each other, finally forming a mechanical plug. Activation is very fast and complex process, and is accompanied by dramatic change of cell shape. This morphological alteration may be vital for the prevention of blood loss. However, there is no complete understanding of its significance, maybe because the quantitative description of the platelet shape during activation is absent. Here, we describe the shape change based on the physical consideration of the platelet cytoskeleton. We propose the formulation of mathematical problem and its solution, which allows one to easily simulate a wide class of shapes for both resting and activated cells. These models are in a good agreement with platelet images observed in numerous experiments published elsewere. They may be used to simulate the shape change and hence the influence of activation on hydrodynamic, mechanical and optical properties of platelets. As a result, novel diagnostic and therapeuthic strategies and clinical implications may be obtained.
