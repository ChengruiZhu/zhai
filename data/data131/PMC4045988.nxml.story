Exposure to high glucose activated calpain, induced apoptosis and reduced nitric oxide (NO) production without changing eNOS protein expression, its phosphorylation and dimers formation in primary human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs). These effects of high glucose correlated with intracellular ROS production and mitochondrial superoxide generation. Selectively scavenging mitochondrial superoxide increased NO production in high glucose-stimulated HUVECs. Inhibition of calpain using over-expression of calpastatin or pharmacological calpain inhibitor prevented high glucose-induced ROS production, mitochondrial superoxide generation and apoptosis, which were concurrent with an elevation of NO production in HUVECs. In mouse models of streptozotocin-induced type-1 diabetes and OVE26 type-1 diabetic mice, calpain activation correlated with an increase in ROS production and peroxynitrite formation in aortas. Transgenic over-expression of calpastatin reduced ROS production and peroxynitrite formation in diabetic mice. In parallel, diabetes-induced reduction of endothelium-dependent relaxation in aortic ring was reversed by over-expression of calpastatin in mouse models of diabetes. However, the protective effect of calpastatin on endothelium-dependent relaxation was abrogated by eNOS deletion in diabetic mice.
