Stem cells and progenitor cells within a tissue are required to maintain tissue homeostasis and to repair tissues after injury by giving rise to differentiated daughter cells. Many progenitor cells express telomerase, a reverse transcriptase enzyme that adds DNA repeats to telomeres, the protective structures that cap chromosome ends. Telomere addition by telomerase is important for normal progenitor cell function and is crucial for enabling cancer cells to divide an unlimited number of times. In addition to its telomere-lengthening function, telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT) can directly activate quiescent epidermal stem cells. However, the mechanism underlying this novel function for TERT is still not understood. In this study, we demonstrate that the catalytic activity of TERT is dispensable for its ability to activate tissue progenitor cells in vivo. Furthermore, using gene microarrays, we show that TERT controls a developmental program that overlaps the natural transcriptional program of hair follicle cycling in mouse skin. Using pattern-matching algorithms, we find that the TERT-controlled genetic program significantly resembles programs regulated by Myc and Wnt, two pathways critical for stem cell function and tumorigenesis. This paper reveals critical new insights into novel mechanisms of non-telomerase functions of TERT, identifying TERT as a developmental regulator linked to control of transcriptional responses.
