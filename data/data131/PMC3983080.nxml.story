Most cell behavior arises as a response to external forces. Signals from the extracellular environment are passed to the cell's nucleus through a complex network of interacting proteins. Perturbing these pathways can change the strength or outcome of the signals, which could be used to treat or prevent a pathological response. While manipulating these networks can be achieved using a variety of methods, the ability to do so predictably over time would provide an unprecedented level of control over cell behavior and could lead to new therapeutic design and research tools in medicine and systems biology. Hence, we propose a practical computational framework to aid in the design of experimental perturbations to force cell signaling dynamics to follow a predefined response. Our approach represents a novel merger of model-based control and information theory to blend the predictions from multiple mathematical models into a meaningful compromise solution. We verify through simulation and experimentation that this solution produces excellent agreement between the cell readouts and several predefined trajectories, even in the presence of significant modeling uncertainty and without measurement feedback. By combining elements of information and control theory, our approach will help advance the best practices in model-based control applications for medicine.
