Cells infected with a temperature-sensitive mutant of vesicular stomatitis virus, ts045, or transfected with the plasmid vector pdTM12 produce mutant forms of the G protein that remain within the ER. The mutant G proteins were isolated by immunoprecipitation from cells metabolically labeled with [2-3H]mannose to facilitate analysis of the protein-linked oligosaccharides. The 3H-labeled glycopeptides recovered from the immunoprecipitated G proteins contained high mannose-type oligosaccharides. Structural analysis, however, indicated that 60-78% of the 3H-mannose-labeled oligosaccharides contained a single glucose residue and no fewer than eight mannose residues. The 3H-labeled ts045 oligosaccharides were deglucosylated and processed to complex-type units after the infected cells were returned to the permissive temperature. When shifted to the permissive temperature in the presence of a proton ionophore, the G protein oligosaccharides were deglucosylated but remained as high mannose-type units. The glucosylated state was observed, therefore, when the G protein existed in an altered conformation. The ts045 G protein oligosaccharides were deglucosylated in vitro by glucosidase II at both the permissive and nonpermissive temperatures. G protein isolated from ts045-infected cells labeled with [6-3H]galactose in the presence of cycloheximide contained 3H-glucose-labeled monoglucosylated oligosaccharides, indicating that the high mannose oligosaccharides were glucosylated in a posttranslational process. These results suggest that aberrant G proteins are selectively modified by resident ER enzymes to retain monoglucosylated oligosaccharides.
