G-protein coupled receptors are the largest family of membrane proteins in the human genome and they constitute the largest class of drug targets. Amongst them, beta adrenergic receptors are involved in the regulation of muscular and vascular tone and are thus molecular targets for the treatment of various diseases including hypertension, heart failure and asthma. The function of these receptors is regulated via the binding of endogenous or exogenous ligands that can either lead to activation (agonists) or inactivation (inverse agonists/antagonists). However, structure determination of these receptors has been very elusive, and the few atomic resolution structures that are available so far have only been obtained in the presence of inverse agonists or antagonists. In order to study the binding mode of agonists inside the binding pocket, we employ all-atom molecular dynamics. This facilitates the study of the details of the interaction between agonist and receptor in full atomistic detail. We find that agonists binding to beta adrenergic receptors require the formation of a highly structured hydrogen bond network that is further stabilized by the presence of internal water molecules. The observed local rearrangements also help provide insights into the molecular origin of the differences between agonist and inverse agonist binding.
