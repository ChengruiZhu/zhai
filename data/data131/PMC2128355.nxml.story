 A malignant tumor which developed at the site of a primary syphilitic lesion in the scrotum of a rabbit, about 4 years after inoculation, and eventually led to the death of the animal, has formed the basis for an extensive series of investigations beginning with the study of the spontaneous tumor. The present report contains the clinical history of the animal from the time of inoculation to its death and the results of pathological examinations. The most important events recorded may be summarized as follows: 1. A mild but persistent syphilitic infection with an occasional relapse and the eventual development of chronic inflammatory lesions in the skin associated with atypical epithelial proliferations. 2. The occurrence, at about the same time, of extensive degenerative changes in the dermis accompanied by an atypical growth of hair follicles, with the production of diffuse and nodular areas of thickening and induration (scleroderma). 3. The development of a growth in the skin of the left scrotum which recurred after removal and spread diffusely over adjacent parts of the skin, and metastasized to the regional lymph nodes and to internal organs. 4. The transplantation of the growth to other rabbits by intratesticular inoculation and the successful propagation of the growth over a period of nearly 2 years (twenty generations). 5. The development of a cachexia and of pressure phenomena from metastases involving the cervical and lumbar regions of the spinal column which eventually led to the death of the animal. 6. The discovery, post mortem, of an extensive leucoplakia of the tongue and buccal mucosa, chronic inflammatory lesions in the esophagus with atypical epithelial proliferation, and a nodular growth in the left testicle differing in character from that in the scrotum. 7. The presence of extensive degenerative changes in the vascular system, degeneration of the parenchymatous organs, atrophy of the thymus and lymphoid system, with chronic lymphadenitis, atrophy, degeneration, and necrosis of the suprarenals, and atrophy and hyperplasia of the thyroid with chronic thyroiditis. The conclusion was reached that the growth in the scrotum represented a neoplasm of epithelial origin which was composed of cells allied to those found in the bulb and root sheath of the hair. No explanation was offered for the origin or unusual malignancy displayed by the tumor pending the introduction of experimental data. It was stated, however, that the evidence presented was sufficient to warrant the assumption that the factor of foremost importance in the development of the tumor was constitutional rather than local.
