 Frequent symptoms of acid reflux, such as heartburn and acid regurgitation, can interfere substantially with daily life activities. Proton-pump inhibitors are the most efficacious treatment for frequent reflux symptoms and are recommended as an appropriate initial treatment in uncomplicated cases. Proton-pump inhibitors have varying pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics across the class; 20Â mg esomeprazole has higher bioavailability and exposure than over-the-counter omeprazole, for example. However, differences in clinical efficacy for symptom relief have not been demonstrated. The safety and tolerability of proton-pump inhibitors have been well established in clinical trial and post-marketing settings, and use of a short regimen is associated with a very low likelihood of missing a more serious condition. Pharmacists can assist patients with accurate self-diagnosis by asking short, simple questions to characterize the nature, severity, and frequency of symptoms. Additionally, pharmacists can inquire about alarm symptoms that should prompt referral to a physician. Pharmacists should inform those patients for whom over-the-counter proton-pump inhibitors are appropriate on their proper use.
