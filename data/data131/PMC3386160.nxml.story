Meiosis is the key developmental program of gametogenesis during which haploid gametes are generated to cope with the doubling chromosome number that occurs after fertilization. During the first meiotic division, homologous chromosomes pair, recombine, and dissociate. Errors in any of these processes are commonly linked to human infertility, spontaneous abortions, and severe aneuploidy-based birth defects. Chiasmata, the cytological manifestations of recombination, provide a physical link that holds the homologous maternal and paternal chromosomes in pairs, facilitating their segregation, and that guarantees each gamete receives only one copy of each chromosome. Recently, however, studies in lower eukaryotes have suggested that, in the absence of recombination, pairing between centromeric regions promotes proper segregation of these non-recombined meiotic homologous chromosomes and contributes significantly to the segregation fidelity of chromosomes that have recombined. We show here that the SYCP1 and SYCP3 proteins are required for centromere pairing in mouse. Our findings define structures and possible mechanisms of a process that was not previously known to occur in mammals, which may act to insure that the correct numbers of chromosomes are transferred to the next generation.
