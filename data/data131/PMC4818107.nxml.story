Biomarkers capable of accurately predicting patient responses to alternate therapies are critical to realizing the vision of precision medicine. Identifying such biomarkers is, however, challenging due to the inherent complexity of biological networks. Here we sought to identify molecular features that predict how a genetically defined subset of cancers (HER2+) differentially depend on two oncogenic signaling pathways, the PI3K/AKT and MAPK/ERK cascades. We find that combined measurement of three non-intuitive proteins (EGFR, ERBB3, and CDKN1B) accurately predicts cellular dependence on these signaling pathways, and responsiveness to drugs targeting their constituents. Notably, this three-biomarker model outperformed both biological intuition (phosho-AKT and phospho-ERK) and current clinical practice (PIK3CA mutations). More broadly, this exemplifies how the functional consequences of a single oncogenic driver (HER2) can depend upon molecular and cellular context. Expression of these markers also varies by indication, such that breast cancers are biased toward PI3K-dependnece, while non-breast indications (lung, ovarian, and gastric) are particularly MAPK-dependent, and thus may respond differently to therapeutic strategies developed for breast cancer. Together, we believe that our results will aid the design of novel, stratified treatment strategies for HER2+ disease.
