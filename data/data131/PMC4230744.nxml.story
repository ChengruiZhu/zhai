Our knowledge of brain activity and network organization during complex motor behaviors in humans relies mainly on neuroimaging studies. However, the majority of available brain imaging methods are not feasible for quantifying the neural processes that occur on very short time-scales at the microscopic level. To address this shortcoming of functional MRI, we designed a mathematical model, which simulates brain activity using local ensembles of neurons and physiologically meaningful variables, such as cellular membrane potentials and ion channel relaxation times. We further incorporated dopaminergic function into our model as a neuromodulator of the dynamic organization of brain networks. We applied our model to examine brain networks controlling human speech and language production. We present a rigorous mathematical proof, which establishes the theoretical validity and solvability of the presented model, and we discuss the influence of dopaminergic transmission on simulated brain activity. We show that our model successfully reproduces characteristic changes seen in empirical data between the resting state and speech production. Our results indicate that the proposed mathematical model may be used as a platform for future studies to investigate the specific impact of certain pathologies within the dopaminergic pathways and their effect on global network dynamics.
