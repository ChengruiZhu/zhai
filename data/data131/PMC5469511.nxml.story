GSD-Ia is an autosomal recessive metabolic disorder caused by a deficiency in G6Pase-α, a key enzyme in maintaining blood glucose levels between meals. Despite strong compliance to dietary therapies, GSD-Ia patients continue manifesting metabolic aberrations including excessive accumulation of glycogen and lipid in the liver. Recently, G6Pase-α deficiency has been linked to impairment in autophagy, a recycling process essential for cellular homeostasis. However, the underlying mechanism is unclear. In this study, we show that hepatic G6Pase-α deficiency alters the activity and/or expression of several lipid regulators, leading to hepatic steatosis and reduced expression of SIRT1, an enzyme that regulates the activity of many proteins via deacetylation. The impaired SIRT1 signaling increases the acetylation of ATG proteins critical for autophagic vesicle elongation, and reduces the activity of FoxO factors that can induce autophagy genes. Consistently, the G6Pase-α-deficient liver exhibits autophagy impairment characterized by attenuated expression of many autophagy components, defective autophagic vesicle elongation, impaired autophagosome formation, and reduced autophagy flux. Importantly, SIRT1 overexpression in G6Pase-α-deficient liver corrects autophagy deficiency. Finally, restoration of hepatic G6Pase-α expression corrects metabolic abnormalities, restores SIRT1-FoxO signaling, and normalizes defective autophagy. Collectively, hepatic G6Pase-α deficiency-mediated down-regulation of SIRT1 signaling underlies defective hepatic autophagy in GSD-Ia.
