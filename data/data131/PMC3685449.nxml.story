Obstetric hemorrhage is the leading cause of maternal mortality and morbidity worldwide. This study was carried out to investigate the effect of obstetric hemorrhage on the prothrombin time (PT), activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT), and platelet count (PLC). Women with obstetric hemorrhage were divided into two categories, women with antepartum hemorrhage (APH) and those with postpartum hemorrhage (PPH). Pregnant women without hemorrhage were included as controls. Eighty-six pregnant women aged 18–45 years (mean age 36.25 ± 10.50 years) were presented to the Obstetrics and Gynaecology Department of Maryam Abacha Women and Children Hospital in Sokoto Metropolis, Sokoto State, Nigeria with history of obstetric hemorrhage. Forty-three age-matched nonhemorrhaging parturient women were included as controls. The determination of PT and APTT was done by manual methods using commercially prepared Diagen reagent kits, whereas PLC was done by manual methods using a hemocytometer. The results of PT and APTT were significantly higher among women with APH (20.7 ± 4.226 seconds and 46.04 ± 8.689 seconds, respectively) and among women with PPH (23.17 ± 2.708 seconds and 53.78 ± 4.089 seconds, respectively) compared to normal pregnant women (15.85 ± 0.8930 seconds and 36.225 ± 5.010 seconds, respectively) (
