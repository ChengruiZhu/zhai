Introduction: The advantages of fibre posts over stainless steel posts have been demonstrated in numerous studies. For clinical success, various factors need to be taken into account in post-retained restorations.
Material and Methods: A review was made of literature on fibre posts published from 2000 to February 2011, identified through searches of the PubMed/Medline databases.
Results: The position of the tooth in the arch, ferrule size, proximal contact, periodontal support and restoration type are survival prediction factors that should be considered when performing post-endodontic restoration. Since fibre posts present good biomechanical behaviour as a result of their elastic modulus, which is similar to that of dentine, treatment failure occurs through decementation rather than because of root fracture, as occurs with metal posts. The shape of the post and, consequently, the thickness of the luting, can modify the retention capacity. Consequently, more anatomically-shaped posts have been developed, as have new techniques to reduce the volume of the dentine/cement interface: lateral condensation, surface remodelling or custom designs. 
Conclusions: Different aspects of the preparation process can be modified to assist in improving fibre post retention, but further investigation, mainly clinical, is needed to acquire a better understanding of how different factors influence the long-term clinical behaviour of the posts.
