Gastric cancer with peritoneal carcinomatosis is a disease with a poor prognosis. Cytoreductive surgery (CRS) and hyperthermic intraperitoneal perioperative chemotherapy (HIPEC) can improve prognosis, although in most cases this should still be considered as a palliative treatment. Therefore, morbidity has to be avoided at all cost as quality of life is of utmost importance. We describe the case of a 64-year-old female with an adenocarcinoma of the stomach that was initially treated with a Billroth II gastrectomy, adjuvant chemotherapy and radiotherapy. During follow-up, the diagnosis of peritoneal carcinomatosis was made, and the patient was referred for CRS and HIPEC. Postoperatively, she developed rhabdomyolysis in both gastrocnemius muscles. Renal function remained within normal limits, but ultrasonography of the lower legs suggested the presence of bilateral abscesses. Drainage with pigtail catheters was necessary for more than 1 month, significantly impairing quality of life. The objective of this case report is to heighten awareness for this complication. Rhabdomyolysis is a rare complication of CRS and HIPEC, with a significant impact on quality of life. Prevention is necessary and can be achieved by adequate surgical positioning, using the altered lithotomy position, sufficient padding and by preventing hypovolemia.
