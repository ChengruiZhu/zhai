Long non-coding RNA HOXA11 antisense RNA (HOXA11-AS) has been previously reported to be involved in the tumorigenesis and progression of ovarian cancer and glioma. However, the function of HOXA11-AS in lung cancer remains unclear. Following the knockdown of HOXA11-AS in A549 cells, a microarray analysis was performed in order to detect the differences in microRNA (miRNA/miR) profiles. Subsequently, miR-642b-3p was selected for further analysis. Four miRNA target prediction algorithms were used to identify potential target genes of miR-642b-3p. Bioinformatics analyses, including Gene Ontology (GO), Kyoto Encyclopaedia of Genes and Genomes, protein-protein interactions (PPIs) and network analysis, were performed to investigate the potential functions, pathways and networks of the target genes. Furthermore, the differential expression of miR-642b-3p and its target genes between normal lung and non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) tissues was verified using The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database. Six target genes [zinc finger protein 350, heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein U, high mobility group box 1, phosphodiesterase 4D (PDE4D), synaptotagmin binding cytoplasmic RNA interacting protein and basic helix-loop-helix family member B9] of miR-642b-3p were predicted using all 4 algorithms. It was revealed that miR-642b-3p was overexpressed in adenocarcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma tissues compared with non-cancerous lung tissues based on the TCGA database. From the 6 target genes, PDE4D was downregulated in lung adenocarcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma tissues, and a weak negative correlation between HOXA11-AS and PDE4D was identified. The area under the curve of PDE4D was 0.905 [95% confidence interval (CI), 0.879–0.931] for patients with lung adenocarcinoma and 0.665 (95% CI, 0.606–0.725) for patients with squamous cell carcinoma. Additionally, GO analysis of the target genes revealed that miR-642b-3p was specifically involved in complex cellular pathways. The target gene RAN binding protein 2 possessed the highest degree of interactions in the PPI network (degree=40). It was hypothesized that HOXA11-AS may have a function in NSCLC by regulating the expression of miR-642b-3p and PDE4D, which laid the foundation for the further elucidation of the potential molecular mechanisms of NSCLC.
