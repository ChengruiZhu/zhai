Identifying genes that contribute to cancer biology is complicated partly because cancers can have dozens of somatic mutations and thousands of germline variants. Somatic mutations are gene variants that arise after conception in an organism while germline variants are gene variants present at conception in an organism. Most methods to identify cancer drivers have focused on determining somatic mutations. In this study we attempt to identify, from a tumor sample, important germline and somatic variants by determining if a variant is expressed (made into RNA) more than expected from the amount of the variant in the genome. The preferred expression of a variant could benefit cancer cells. When applying our analysis to ovarian cancer samples we found that despite the apparent heterogeneity, different patients frequently share the same genes with preferentially expressed variants. These genes in many cases are known to affect cancer processes such as DNA repair, cell adhesion and cell signaling and are targetable with known drugs. We therefore conclude that our analysis can identify germline and somatic gene variants that contribute to cancer biology and can potentially guide individualized therapies.
