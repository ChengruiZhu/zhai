Glycosaminoglycan (GAG) has a pivot role in renal function and homeostasis. Analysis of GAG amount generally serves to determine GAG alteration due to diabetes mellitus. Critical Electrolyte Concentration (CEC) staining can be an efficacy method to study GAG amount changes. Based on an experimental study, 20 male rats were randomly divided equally into two experimental and control groups. Diabetes mellitus was induced by a single sub cutaneous injection (120 mg/kg) of alloxan monohydrate. After 8 weeks, diabetic kidneys were paraffin embedded and sectioned at 5Î¼m on a microtome. Slides were prepared and studied after staining by Critical Electrolyte Concentration (CEC 1 -4). In this study, we succeeded to show a decrease of hyaluronic acid and chondroitin sulfate concentration in diabetic kidney at 8 weeks diabetic rats which are earlier signs compared to those reported previously. In contrary, no significant changes in heparin sulfate and keratin sulfate have been seen. Diabetic nephropathy is a progressive disease and earlier diagnosis makes a better treatment design to reduce its development. CEC staining is able to determine degradation of hyaluronic acid and chondroitin sulfate synthesis in diabetic kidney of rats in an earlier time
