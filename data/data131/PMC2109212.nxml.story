 has been undertaken in order to obtain a view of the relationships of microtubules and their cross bridges not dependent on conventional preparative procedures. Reactivation studies using isolated axostyles prepared for freeze-fracture and then thawed demonstrate that we are observing the structure of a potentially functional axostyle. Cross fractures through the axostyle demonstrate more extensive interrow bridging than expected on the basis of observations of thin-sectioned material. Each microtubule has approximately sixfold bridge-binding sites with connections to as many as four interrow bridges. Measurements of microtubule diameter and spacing are significantly larger than those made from sectioned material and may indicate that conventional processing for electron microscopy results in the loss of structurally important water within the microtubule in addition to loss of intertubule material. Longitudinal fractures through the axostyle at various orientations demonstrate a minimum longitudinal periodicity of 160 Ã… for both the spacing of the globular subunits within the microtubule wall and the spacing of the intrarow bridges. While intrarow bridges are strictly periodic and always oriented in parallel, interrow bridges are not strictly periodic and can be oriented at varying angles to the microtubule axis.
