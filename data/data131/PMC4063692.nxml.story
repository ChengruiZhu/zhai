 is a family of DNA viruses that have characteristically large and complex genomes. This defining feature is also responsible for bioinformatic challenges that complicate herpesvirus genomics, and why an endogenous herpesvirus remains elusive. Given that several species of herpesvirus are clinically relevant to humans, there is a pressing demand for techniques capable of generating and managing large quantities of herpesvirus genome data. This is coupled with a need to explore herpesvirus diversity in order to understand pathogenesis within an evolutionary context. Lessons from the study of ancient viral integrations have also highlighted the need to include information offered by paleoviruses. Using perspectives from paleovirology and metagenomics, we identify three herpesviruses within the genome data of their primate hosts, including the first endogenous herpesvirus. All three viruses are closely related to important human pathogens and two of them are entirely new species. Both comparative molecular biology and evolutionary analysis were applied to examine our results for their clinical relevance. Furthermore, we demonstrate how this analytical approach was also used for the data collection itself, by treating nucleotide databases in their entirety as a single metagenomic resource.
