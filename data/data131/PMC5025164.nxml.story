Infectious diseases result in millions of deaths and cost billions of dollars annually. Hence, there is urgency for developing more innovative and effective antiviral therapeutics. In this study, we used libraries of randomly mutagenized cells to discover cellular genes that are essential for the replication of 10 distinct cytotoxic mammalian viruses. We herein reported over 700 candidate cellular genes, over 20% of which were independently selected by multiple viruses in one or more cell types. Using systems biology-based analysis, we found that host genes associated with viral replication tended to occupy central hubs in the human protein interactome and to be ancient genes with low evolutionary rates, compared to non-virus-associated genes. Cell cycle phase-specific sub-network analysis showed that host cell cycle program played important roles during viral replication by regulating specific cell cycle phases. Moreover, we presented novel evidences to suggest that host genes supporting viral replication were frequently implicated in Mendelian and orphan diseases, or played critical roles in cancer. Importantly, we found approximately 110 new putative druggable antiviral targets by merging genome-wide gene-trap insertional mutagenesis, drug-gene network, and bioinformatics data. Furthermore, we have demonstrated the use of a computable representation of genetic testing to effectively identify new potential antiviral indications for existing drugs. In summary, this study presents new and important methodologies for developing broadly active antiviral therapeutics.
