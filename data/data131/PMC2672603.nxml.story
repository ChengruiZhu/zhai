Maintaining a precise intracellular calcium concentration is key for cell survival. In skeletal muscle, ryanodine receptor type 1 (RyR1) is an intracellular calcium-release channel that is critical for contraction. Here, we used single-channel techniques to demonstrate the presence of functionally homogenous populations of RyR1 in either the closed or open state and then applied cryo-electron microscopy and image processing to determine the 3D structure of each state. The 3D structures show that RyR1′s ion pathway is formed by two sets of bundles, each containing four rods along a common axis. One set (inner helices) stretches from the lumen to the ion gate, whereas the second (inner branches) stretches from the ion gate to the peripheral cytoplasmic domains. The configuration of the two bundles is clearly different in the two physiological states, allowing a 4 Å increase in diameter of the ion gate upon opening. This diameter increase is sufficient to ensure flow of calcium ions. Upon gating, the cytoplasmic domains undergo a conformational change that converges on the inner branches, revealing a long-range allosteric mechanism that directly connects effectors acting on the cytoplasmic moiety with the ion gate.
