Approximately 60% of all ovarian tumors are epithelial in origin, and these neoplasms are thought to arise from the ovarian surface epithelium or small epithelial inclusion cysts. Surface epithelium is capable of differentiating into serous (tubal), mucinous, endometrioid or transitional epithelium. Serous and mucinous cystadenomas are the most common epithelial tumors and, together, account for about 30% of ovarian tumors We report a case of a 29-year-old lady P1L1 presenting with the chief complaints of pain abdomen off and on since the last 1 year. Ultrasonography revealed normal uterus with enlarged right ovary, with a cyst measuring 46 mm × 36 mm × 55 mm showing internal echoes with volume of 50 cc., left ovary also enlarged with multiple well-defined cysts measuring 34 mm × 44 mm × 69 mm with volume of 55 cc and the largest cyst measuring 37 mm. Bilateral ovarian cystectomy was done and sent for histopathology. To our surprise, both the ovaries revealed different histopathological pictures, with the right ovary revealing serous cystadenoma and the left ovary showing mucinous cystadenoma. This rare occurrence has never been reported so far in the literature to the best of our knowledge.
