Gas chromatography with quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry (GC-QTOFMS) and soft ionization generated by a rare-gas plasma is described here for the determination of various chlorophenoxy acid methyl esters and a few chlorinated herbicides. This plasma-based, wavelength-selectable ionization source, which can use Xe, Kr, Ar, Ne, or He as the plasma gas, enables ionization of GC-amenable compounds with ionization energies below 8.4, 10, 11.6, 16.5, or 22.4 eV, respectively. The advantages of soft ionization include enhanced molecular ions, reduced fragmentation, and reduced background noise as compared to electron ionization. In the study presented here for two plasma gases, we demonstrate that Kr plasma, which is softer than Ar plasma, yields molecular ions with a relative intensity >60% for 11 of the 16 test compounds. When using this “tunable” plasma to ionize the analytes, there is the possibility for selective ionization and less fragmentation, which may lead to increased sensitivity and may help structure elucidation, especially when using high-resolution mass spectrometry that generates accurate masses within a few parts per million (ppm) mass errors. Data generated with the Ar plasma and real matrices such as a peppermint extract, a plum extract, and an orange peel extract, spiked with 16 test compounds, indicate that the test compounds can be detected at 1–10 pg/μL of extract, and compounds such as menthone, limonene, eucalyptol, pinene, caryophylene, and other C
