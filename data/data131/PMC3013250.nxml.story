The study was conducted to measure the effectiveness of providing bottled water in reducing arsenic exposure. Urine, tap-water and toenail samples were collected from non-smoking adults residing in Ajo (n=40) and Tucson (n=33), Arizona, USA. The Ajo subjects were provided bottled water for 12 months prior to re-sampling. The mean total arsenic (μg/L) in tap-water was 20.3±3.7 in Ajo and 4.0±2.3 in Tucson. Baseline urinary total inorganic arsenic (μg/L) was significantly higher among the Ajo subjects (n=40, 29.1±20.4) than among the Tucson subjects (n=32, 11.0±12.0, p<0.001), as was creatinine-adjusted urinary total inorganic arsenic (μg/g) (35.5±25.2 vs 13.2±9.3, p<0.001). Baseline concentrations of arsenic (μg/g) in toenails were also higher among the Ajo subjects (0.51±0.72) than among the Tucson subjects (0.17±0.21) (p<0.001). After the intervention, the mean urinary total inorganic arsenic in Ajo (n=36) dropped by 21%, from 29.4±21.1 to 23.2±23.2 (p=0.026). The creatinine-adjusted urinary total inorganic arsenic and toenail arsenic levels did not differ significantly with the intervention. Provision of arsenic-free bottled water resulted in a modest reduction in urinary total inorganic arsenic.
