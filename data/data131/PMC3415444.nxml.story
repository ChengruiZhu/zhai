For successful segregation of homologous chromosomes during sexual reproduction, homologs must first identify and pair with their correct partners. Further, many organisms stabilize and maintain alignment between paired homologs through assembly of a highly ordered structure known as the synaptonemal complex (SC). Pairing and synapsis must be tightly coordinated to ensure that SC assembly only occurs in a productive manner, linking the axes of correctly aligned homologous chromosomes. In this work, we identify HAL-2, a protein that concentrates in the nucleoplasm of germ cells, as a key player in mediating this coordination. We find that precursors of the SC have the potential to inhibit homolog pairing, interfering with the very process that the SC normally serves to stabilize. Moreover, we show that HAL-2 promotes homolog pairing and associated chromosome movement primarily by counteracting these detrimental inhibitory effects of SC precursors. Our data suggest that HAL-2 serves to prevent inappropriate association of SC precursors with chromosomes prior to licensing of SC assembly, and we propose that HAL-2 may enable precursors to accumulate in a manner that allows rapid, cooperative SC assembly upon homology verification.
