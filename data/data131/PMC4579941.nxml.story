We reviewed 465 serial cardiac magnetic resonance studies (98 Duchenne muscular dystrophy patients with ≥4 cardiac magnetic resonance studies) for left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) and presence of late gadolinium enhancement (LGE), a marker for myocardial fibrosis. LVEF was modeled by examining LGE status, myocardial fibrosis burden (as assessed by the number of LGE‐positive left ventricular segments), patient age, and steroid treatment duration. An age‐only model demonstrated that LVEF declined 0.58±0.10% per year. In patients with both LGE‐negative and LGE‐positive studies (n=51), LVEF did not decline significantly over time if LGE was absent but declined 2.2±0.31% per year when LGE was present. Univariate modeling showed significant associations between LVEF and steroid treatment duration, presence of LGE, and number of LGE‐positive left ventricular segments; multivariate modeling showed that LVEF declined by 0.93±0.09% for each LGE‐positive left ventricular segment, whereas age and steroid treatment duration were not significant. The number of LGE‐positive left ventricular segments increased with age, and longer steroid treatment duration was associated with lower age‐related increases.
