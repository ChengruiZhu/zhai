End-stage liver and kidney disease (ELKD) is an indication for deceased donor simultaneous liver-kidney transplantation. Although a few cases of living donor liver-kidney transplantation have been reported, the invasiveness remains to be discussed. Living donor liver transplantation (LDLT) is an alternative choice for ELKD, but has never been reported. Here, we report a case of successful LDLT for a patient with ELKD on hemodialysis. The patient was a 63-year-old male and had decompensated hepatitis C cirrhosis with seronegativity for hepatitis C virus. He had non-diabetic end-stage renal failure and had been on hemodialysis for 3 years. He was in good general condition except for hepatic and renal failure. The living donor was his 58-year-old healthy wife. A right lobe graft was transplanted to the recipient under continuous hemodiafiltration (CHDF) and extracorporeal veno-venous bypass. CHDF was continued until postoperative day 4, at which point CHDF was converted to hemodialysis. His posttransplant course was good and he was discharged on postoperative day 36. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of LDLT for a patient on chronic hemodialysis. Therefore, being on hemodialysis is not a contraindication for LDLT. LDLT is feasible for a patient with ELKD on hemodialysis.
