Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is an important regulator of blood vessel growth. To date, therapies attempting to harness the VEGF system to promote blood vessel growth (e.g. for wound healing or ischemic disease) have achieved only limited success. To improve VEGF-based therapies, we need to better understand how VEGF promotes development of functional blood vessels. We have developed a computational model of VEGF binding to the receptor VEGFR2, trafficking of VEGFR2 through endosomal compartments in the cell, and activation of VEGFR2 on several tyrosine residues. The pattern of tyrosines activated on VEGFR2 influences cell behavior, promoting cell survival, proliferation, or migration. The combination of these cues influences the diameter of vessels, degree of branching, and leakiness of the resultant vessel network. Our model shows that changes in VEGFR2 trafficking as a result of VEGF immobilization to the extracellular matrix are sufficient to describe observed changes in the pattern of VEGFR2 activation compared to stimulation with purely soluble VEGF. This model can be used to predict how VEGF immobilization, interactions with co-receptors or proteins that deactivate VEGFR2, and changes to VEGFR2 trafficking can be tuned to promote development of functional blood vessel networks for tissue engineering applications.
