Graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) is a fatal complication that occurs after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. To understand the dynamics of CD4 and CD8 T cell production of IFN-γ and IL-17 during GVHD progression, we established a GVHD model by transplanting T cell-depleted bone marrow (TCD-BM) and purified T cells from B6 mice into irradiated BALB.B, creating an MHC-matched but minor histocompatibility (H) antigen-mismatched transplantation (B6 → BALB.B GVHD). Transplantation-induced GVHD was confirmed by the presence of the appropriate compositional changes in the T cell compartments and innate immune cells in the blood and the systemic secretion of inflammatory cytokines. Using this B6 → BALB.B GVHD model, we showed that the production of IFN-γ and IL-17 by CD4 T cells preceded that by CD8 T cells in the spleen, mesenteric lymph node, liver, and lung in the BALB.B GVHD host, and Th1 differentiation predated Th17 differentiation in all organs during GVHD progression. Such changes in cytokine production were based on changes in cytokine gene expression by the T cells at different time points during GVHD development. These results demonstrate that both IFN-γ and IL-17 are produced by CD4 and CD8 T cells but with different kinetics during GVHD progression.
