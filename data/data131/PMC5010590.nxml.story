Maintenance of articular cartilage allografts in culture media is a common method of tissue storage; however, the technical parameters of graft storage remain controversial. In this study, we examined the optimal temperature and culture medium exchange rate for the storage of osteochondral allografts in vitro. Cylindrical osteochondral grafts (n = 120), harvested from the talar joint surface of ten Boer goats, were randomly classified into four groups and stored under the following conditions: Group A1 was maintained at 4 °C in culture medium that was refreshed every 2 days; Group A2 was maintained at 4 °C in the same culture medium, without refreshing; Group B1, was maintained at 37 °C in culture medium that was refreshed every 2 days; Group B2, was maintained at 37 °C in the same culture medium, without refreshing. Chondrocyte viability in the grafts was determined by ethidium bromide/fluorescein diacetate staining on days 7, 21, and 35. Proteoglycan content was measured by Safranin-O staining. Group A1 exhibited the highest chondrocyte survival rates of 90.88 %, 88.31 % and 78.69 % on days 7, 21, and 35, respectively. Safranin O staining revealed no significant differences between groups on days 21 and 35. These results suggest that storage of osteochondral grafts at 4 °C with regular culture medium replacement should be highly suitable for clinical application.
