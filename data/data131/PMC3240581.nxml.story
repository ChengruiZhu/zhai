Experimental data from neuroscience have provided substantial knowledge about the intricate structure of cortical microcircuits, but their functional role, i.e. the computational calculus that they employ in order to interpret ambiguous stimuli, produce predictions, and derive movement plans has remained largely unknown. Earlier assumptions that these circuits implement a logic-like calculus have run into problems, because logical inference has turned out to be inadequate to solve inference problems in the real world which often exhibits substantial degrees of uncertainty. In this article we propose an alternative theoretical framework for examining the functional role of precisely structured motifs of cortical microcircuits and dendritic computations in complex neurons, based on probabilistic inference through sampling. We show that these structural details endow cortical columns and areas with the capability to represent complex knowledge about their environment in the form of higher order dependencies among salient variables. We show that it also enables them to use this knowledge for probabilistic inference that is capable to deal with uncertainty in stored knowledge and current observations. We demonstrate in computer simulations that the precisely structured neuronal microcircuits enable networks of spiking neurons to solve through their inherent stochastic dynamics a variety of complex probabilistic inference tasks.
