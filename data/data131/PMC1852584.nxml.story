For each chromosome, the complementary DNA strands consist of a “younger” strand synthesized during the most recent round of DNA replication and an “older” strand synthesized during a previous cell division. When the strands separate to serve as templates for DNA synthesis during a subsequent round of replication, the two sister chromatids formed thus differ in terms of the template strand age. The “immortal strand hypothesis” predicts that a stem cell is capable of distinguishing between chromatids based on template age: when it divides, the self-renewing daughter will inherit the chromatids with the older templates, whereas the daughter destined to differentiate will inherit those with the newer templates. However, in vivo evidence in support of this hypothesis has been sparse. By labeling newly synthesized DNA in sequential divisions of stem/progenitors during muscle regeneration, we observed that almost half of the dividing cells sorted their chromatids based on template age. The more stem-like daughter inherited chromatids with older templates, and the more differentiated daughter inherited chromatids with younger templates. We propose that this phenomenon is a characteristic of asymmetrically dividing stem cells and their progeny.
