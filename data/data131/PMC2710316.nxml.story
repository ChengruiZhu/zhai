Mental stress by Stroop color word conflict, math or anger recall tests caused CA vasodilation in young healthy subjects (0.61 ± 0.06 to 0.65 ± 0.07 cm, p < 0.05) and in older healthy subjects (0.63 ± 0.06 to 0.66 ± 0.07 cm, p < 0.05), whereas no CA vasodilation occurred in hypertensive subjects (0.69 ± 0.06 to 0.68 ± 0.07 cm; p, NS). CA blood flow in response to mental stress increased in young healthy subjects (419 ± 134 to 541 ± 209 ml, p < 0.01 vs. baseline) and in older healthy subjects (351 ± 114 to 454 ± 136 ml, p < 0.01 vs. baseline) whereas no change in blood flow (444 ± 143 vs. 458 ± 195 ml; p, 0.59) occurred in hypertensive subjects. There was no difference in the CA response to nitroglycerin in healthy and hypertensive subjects. Mental stress caused a significant increase in baseline to peak MCA systolic (84 ± 22 to 95 ± 22 cm/s, p < 0.05), diastolic (42 ± 12 to 49 ± 14 cm/s, p < 0.05) as well as mean (30 ± 13 to 39 ± 13 cm/s, p < 0.05) PW Doppler velocities in normal subjects, whereas no change in systolic (70 ± 18 to 73 ± 22 cm/s, p < 0.05), diastolic (34 ± 14 to 37 ± 14 cm/s, p = ns) or mean velocities (25 ± 9 to 26 ± 9 cm/s, p = ns) occurred in hypertensive subjects, despite a similar increase in heart rate and blood pressure in response to mental stress in both groups.
