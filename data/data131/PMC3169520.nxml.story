We look at gene-by-diet and gene-by-sex interactions underlying natural variation in multiple metabolic traits mapping to the same regions of the genome in a mouse model. We find that the underlying genetic architecture of these traits is different in different sex and diet contexts. We further use expression data and whole-genome polymorphism data to identify compelling candidates for experimental follow-up. We use these results to examine theoretical evolutionary predictions about how variation in populations can be maintained. There has been much discussion of late on how to use evolutionary theory to inform medical genomics. Mouse models may be especially appropriate for bridging the divide between evolutionary and biomedical research, because they allow the study of the effects of natural alleles on normal variation and because human-mouse homology is well defined. Our study is unique in examining quantitative trait loci from both evolutionary and biomedical perspectives, and we highlight the complex connections of the traits comprising the metabolic syndrome and the evolutionary implications of their underlying genetic architecture. This is important for understanding disease etiology and is relevant to personalized medicine.
