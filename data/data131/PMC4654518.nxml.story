As most organisms exist in an environment that changes predictably with a 24-hour period, highly optimized genetic circuits turn on and off the production of key regulatory proteins to anticipate the day/night cycle. In humans, the demands of a modern society have required that we deviate from this evolutionarily prescribed sleep and feeding schedule, resulting in increased long-term risks of metabolic disease. There is therefore a desire to find pharmacological treatments that would restore the normal functioning of our circadian clock despite irregular behavioral schedules. One aspect of these treatments that is often overlooked in searching for candidate drugs is how these treatments might affect the accuracy of the circadian timing system. Recording the time of each cell is possible but difficult; as a result single-cell approaches cannot be scaled up to high-throughput searches. In this paper, we show that it is possible to estimate how much the noise of a system has changed by looking only at the averaged protein production of an entire population of cells. Such an approach allows us to analyze prior data from high-throughput screens, and show that the natural clock has been highly optimized to be both accurate and high amplitude.
