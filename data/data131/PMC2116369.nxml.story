The present study was undertaken to determine the relationship between the hyaluronate receptor and CD44 (H-CAM), cell-surface glycoproteins of similar molecular weights that have been implicated in cell adhesion. In initial experiments, a panel of monoclonal antibodies directed against CD44 were tested for their ability to cross react with the hyaluronate receptor. These antibodies immunoprecipitated [3H]hyaluronate binding activity from detergent extracts of both mouse and human cells, indicating that the hyaluronate receptor is identical to CD44. In addition, one of these antibodies (KM-201 to mouse CD44) directly blocked the binding of labeled hyaluronate to the receptor and inhibited hyaluronate dependent aggregation of SV-3T3 cells. CD44 has also been implicated in lymphocyte binding to high endothelial venules during lymphocyte homing. Interestingly, the monoclonal antibody Hermes- 3, which blocks lymphocyte binding to the high endothelial venules of mucosal lymphoid tissue, had no effect on the binding of labeled hyaluronate. Furthermore, the binding of lymphocytes to high endothelial cells of lymph nodes and mucosal lymphoid tissue was not significantly affected by treatment with agents that block the binding of hyaluronate (hyaluronidase, excess hyaluronate and specific antibodies). Thus, CD44 appears to have at least two distinct functional domains, one for binding hyaluronate and another involved in interactions with mucosal high endothelial venules.
