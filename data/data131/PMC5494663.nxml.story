The present study aimed to identify differentially expressed inflammatory factors observed in Wilms tumors (WT), and to investigate the association of these factors with clinical stage, pathological type, lymph node metastasis and vascular involvement of WT. Surface-enhanced laser desorption/ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry was performed to screen differentially expressed proteins among WT and normal tissue pairs. Upregulated proteins in WT were separated and purified by solid phase extraction and Tricine SDS-PAGE, respectively. Following in-gel digestion, the peptide mixture was subjected to liquid chromatography mass spectrometry to identify proteins on the basis of their amino acid sequences. Immunohistochemistry was used to confirm the expression of differentially expressed inflammatory proteins. Of the proteins that were upregulated in WT, two proteins with mass/charge (m/z) ratio of 12,138 and 13,462 were identified as macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF) and C-X-C motif ligand 7 (CXCL7) chemokine, respectively. The expression of these two proteins was increased in WT compared with adjacent normal tissues and normal renal tissues, and increased with increasing clinical stage. In addition, their expression was significantly increased in patients with unfavorable pathological type, lymph node metastasis and vascular involvement compared with the groups with favorable type, and without lymph node metastasis or vascular involvement (P<0.05). Increased pro-inflammatory MIF and CXCL7 expression in WT is closely associated with the clinical stage, pathological type, lymph node metastasis and vascular involvement, and may represent biomarkers for the clinical diagnosis of WT.
