Pancreatic cancer is one of the most deadly cancers with a poor prognosis. Although microRNAs are involving in the carcinogenesis and development of pancreatic cancer, little information is known regarding the role of miR-663b in pancreatic cancer. In this study, the expression of miR-663b in pancreatic cancer cells was down-regulated by hypermethylation in its putative promoter region, and overexpression of miR-663b repressed cell proliferation, invasion and migration, and induced apoptosis in pancreatic cancer cells. Bioinformatics analysis, luciferase report assay and rescue experiments showed that insulin-like growth factor 2 (IGF2) was a direct target of miR-663b. Results from clinical samples showed that the expression level of miR-663b correlated with the pathological grading, and the expression of miR-663b was down-regulated and was inversely correlated with IGF2 expression level in pancreatic cancer tissues. More importantly, the long non-coding RNA, HOX transcript antisense RNA (HOTAIR), was up-regulated in both pancreatic cancer cells and tissues, and HOTAIR suppressed the expression of miR-663b in pancreatic cancer by histone modification on H3K4me3 and H3K27me3 on miR-663b promoter.
