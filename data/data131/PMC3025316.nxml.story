Oncolytic viruses capable of tumor-selective replication and cytolysis have shown early promise as cancer therapeutics. We have developed replication-competent attenuated herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) mutants, named HF10 and Hh101, which have been evaluated for their oncolytic activities. However, the host immune system remains a significant obstacle to effective intraperitoneal administration of these viruses in the clinical setting. In this study, we investigated the use of these HSV-1 mutants as oncolytic agents against ovarian cancer and the use of human peritoneal mesothelial cells (MCs) as carrier cells for intraperitoneal therapy. MCs were efficiently infected with HSV-1 mutants, and MCs loaded with HSV-1 mutants caused cell killing adequately when cocultured with cancer cells in the presence or absence of HSV antibodies. In a mouse xenograft model of ovarian cancer, the injection of infected carrier cells led to a significant reduction of tumor volume and prolonged survival in comparison with the injection of virus alone. Our results indicate that replication-competent attenuated HSV-1 exerts a potent oncolytic effect on ovarian cancer, which may be further enhanced by the utilization of a carrier cell delivery system, based on amplification of viral load and possibly on avoidance of neutralizing antibodies.
