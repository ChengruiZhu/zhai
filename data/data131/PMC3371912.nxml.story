Acquired or inherited genetic alterations either alone or in combination with epigenetic alterations are associated with prostate carcinogenesis and its progression toward advance metastatic or castration-resistant disease. A major objective of translational cancer research in post-genome era is to discover the repertoire of genetic and epigenetic variations associated with prostate cancer. Genome-wide association studies have been at least partially successful in identifying potential germline polymorphisms and allelic imbalances such as microsatellite instability and loss of heterozygosity associated with prostate cancer susceptibility. Epigenetic mechanisms such as DNA hyper- or hypomethylation and histone modifications are reversible genetic alterations which allow stable inheritance of cellular phenotypes without any changes in the DNA sequence or quantity. Epigenetic modifications can potentially be used for the molecular classification, detection, and risk assessment in prostate cancer. Chemical inhibitors of DNA methyltransferases and histone deacetylases have been used in different clinical trials and hold promise as novel chemotherapeutics to be effective alone or in combination with other therapeutic interventions in prostate cancer.
