Over the last two decades, an impressive progress has been made in the identification of novel factors in the translocation machineries of the mitochondrial protein import and their possible roles. The role of lipids and possible protein–lipids interactions remains a relatively unexplored territory. Investigating the role of potential lipid-binding regions in the sub-units of the mitochondrial motor might help to shed some more light in our understanding of protein–lipid interactions mechanistically. Bioinformatics results seem to indicate multiple potential lipid-binding regions in each of the sub-units. The subsequent characterization of some of those regions in silico provides insight into the mechanistic functioning of this intriguing and essential part of the protein translocation machinery. Details about the way the regions interact with phospholipids were found by the use of Monte Carlo simulations. For example, Pam18 contains one possible transmembrane region and two tilted surface bound conformations upon interaction with phospholipids. The results demonstrate that the presented bioinformatics approach might be useful in an attempt to expand the knowledge of the possible role of protein–lipid interactions in the mitochondrial protein translocation process.
