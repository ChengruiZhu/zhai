A new methodology is presented that allows the rapid determination of elastic constants of cubic fibre-textured thin films by X-ray diffraction. The theoretical concept is developed and tested on calculated examples of Cu and CrN films. The mechanical elastic constants are extrapolated from X-ray elastic constants by taking into consideration crystal and macroscopic elastic anisotropy. The derived algorithm enables the determination of a reflection and the corresponding value of the X-ray anisotropic factor Γ for which the X-ray elastic constants are equal to their mechanical counterparts in the case of fibre-textured cubic polycrystalline aggregates. The approach is independent of the crystal elastic anisotropy and depends on the fibre-texture type, the texture sharpness, the number of randomly oriented crystallites and the supposed grain-interaction model. In the experimental part, out-of-plane Young’s moduli of 111 and 311 fibre-textured Cu and CrN thin films deposited on monocrystalline Si(100) substrates are determined. The moduli are extrapolated from thin-film experimental X-ray elastic constants that are determined by a combination of X-ray diffraction substrate curvature and sin
