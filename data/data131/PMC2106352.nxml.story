., on their internal surface they have an amorphous or filamentous substance and their external surface is studded with many fine radially oriented spike-like projections. The pinosomes of early oocytes do not contain a demonstrable internal structure; they are thought to contain nutritive substances for the developing oocytes rather than yolk precursors. When the oocyte enters its last stage of growth, characterized by yolk deposition, the caveolae become filled with a dense material which is thought to be the precursors of yolk. Hence the conclusion is drawn that yolk formation is independent of any cytoplasmic organelle system of the oocyte and that the precursors of this deutoplasmic substance are manufactured outside the ovary and are internalized by the process of pinocytosis. Under the phase-contrast microscope the nucleoli of early oocytes are large irregular masses and show the phenomenon of nucleolar emission (fragmentation). These "emissions" become randomly dispersed in the nucleoplasm and some of them come to be intimately associated with the fenestrated nuclear envelope. After this process ceases, the main nucleolar mass becomes vacuolated. Electron micrographs suggest that the constituent particles of the nucleolar emissions migrate from the nucleus through patent pores of the nuclear envelope.
