The development of smart nanoparticles that can exhibit the anti-cancer activity, introduces better efficacy and lower toxicity for treatment. The present study was aimed to evaluate the anti-cancer activity of surface functionalized CoO nanoparticles against Jurkat (T-cell lymphoma) and KB (oral carcinoma) cell lines. The nano-sized cobalt oxide nanoparticles (CoO) was prepared by thermal decomposition method followed by surface modification using phosphonomethyl iminodiacetic acid (PMIDA). The PMIDA-coated CoO nanoparticle was characterized by X-ray diffraction, dynamic light scattering, and transmission electron microscopy; and the conjugation was analyzed by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. The resultant nanoparticles with an average size less than 100Â nm measured by dynamic light scattering and transmission electron microscopy. Cytotoxicity study, flow cytometric analysis and scanning electron micrographs have been revealed that PMIDA-coated nanoparticles significantly enhances the cellular uptake of the nanoparticle and thus facilitates apoptosis of cancer cell (Jurkat and KB). For the application of PMIDA-coated CoO nanoparticles in the medical field, doxorubicin, a potent anti-cancer drug, has been used in similar fashion in this experimental design and all these effects or patterns were observed.
