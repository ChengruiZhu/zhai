A mind-blowing diversity of sex-determining mechanisms exists among eukaryotes, but highly differentiated sex chromosomes—a degenerate, gene-poor Y chromosome, and an often dosage-compensated X—appear to represent an evolutionary dead-end. In our manuscript, we systematically study the genomic composition of sex chromosomes across dipteran insects (flies and mosquitoes), which are generally considered to show stable XY sex chromosomes. Our whole-genome analysis of 37 fly species from 22 families of Diptera uncovers tremendous hidden variation in sex chromosomes. Some species have newly gained or secondarily lost their sex chromosomes; in others, a different chromosome has replaced the original sex chromosome or multiple chromosomal elements have become incorporated into the sex chromosomes; still other species have female heterogametic sex chromosomes. We perform a comparative transcriptome analysis to show that dosage compensation has evolved multiple times, consistently through up-regulation of the single X chromosome in males. These species provide a rich resource to study sex chromosome biology in a comparative manner and show that similar selective forces have shaped the unique evolution of sex chromosomes in diverse fly taxa.
