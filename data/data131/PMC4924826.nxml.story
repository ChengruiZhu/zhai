Rett syndrome (RTT) is a debilitating neurodevelopmental disorder with no cure or effective treatment. To fully understand the disease mechanism and develop therapies, it is necessary to study all aspects of the molecular function of methyl-CpG binding protein 2 (MeCP2), mutations in which have been identified as the genetic cause of RTT. Over the years, MeCP2 has been shown to maintain DNA methylation, regulate transcription and chromatin structure, control microRNA processing, and modulate RNA splicing. Among these known functions, the role of MeCP2 in modulating RNA splicing is less well understood. We took several unbiased approaches to investigate the how MeCP2 may regulate splicing, what splicing changes are caused by the loss of MeCP2, and what functional consequences are caused by altered splicing. We discovered that MeCP2 interacts with splicing factors to regulated the splicing of glutamate receptor genes, which mediate the vast majority of excitatory synaptic transmission in the brain; and linked the altered splicing of glutamate receptor genes to specific synaptic changes in a RTT mouse model. Our findings not only advance the understanding of RTT disease mechanism, but also reveal a potential drug target for future development of therapies.
