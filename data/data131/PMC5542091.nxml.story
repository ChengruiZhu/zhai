A total of 170 patients met inclusion criteria for the study with a mean age of 63.7 years old (range 18-82). A total of n=12 patients required additional surgical intervention after the index TSA procedure, n=8 required lysis of adhesions/debridement and n=4 required revision from TSA to reverse TSA. A total of 131 of the 170 patients more specifically participated in recreational activities. Activities included golf (n=33), tennis (n=14); biking (n=12); swimming (n=5); weight lifting (n=11); snow sports (n=25); and other sports (n=32 including: wrestling, walking, hiking, fishing, throwing, softball, soccer, running, sailing, rancher/farmer, hunting, horseback riding, kayaking, rafting). The type of recreational activity did not make a difference in outcome scores. There was a significant increase preoperatively to postoperatively in the mean ASES (48.5 to 85.9, p<0.05); Quick DASH (40.0 to 16.2, p<0.05); SANE (49.8 to 80.2, p<0.05); SF-12 PCS (57.5 to 48.4, p<0.05); and median satisfaction after surgery was 10. The rate of return to pre-surgical recreational sporting activity following TSA was 69.7%. 24% reported some difficulty and 6.4% reported very difficult or unable to return to recreational activity.
