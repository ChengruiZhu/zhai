While natural environments constantly change, certain events can predict the future occurrence of others. Learning ordering relationships is vital for animal perception and human communication, yet how such learning and prior experience affect the brain remains poorly understood. We set out to understand how learning relationships between words modifies neuronal responses in both humans and monkeys. Using an implicit learning paradigm, we exposed human subjects and monkeys to sequences of nonsense speech sounds that followed certain rule-based ordering relationships (an “artificial grammar”). We then recorded neural responses directly from the auditory cortex in both species in response to sequences that were either consistent with the artificial grammar or created illegal ordering transitions between elements in a sequence. We found that learned ordering relationships modulate a diversity of neural responses (some of which coordinate in similar ways) at the scale of populations of neurons in both species. Our experiments in monkeys also revealed that this scale of neural processing is related to single neurons, the fundamental processing unit in the brain. This study reveals the conserved neuronal signatures of the auditory cortex involved in monitoring learned sequencing operations, which mechanistically inform and extend ideas on how the brain predicts the sensory world.
