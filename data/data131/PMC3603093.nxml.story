The occurrence of ectopic parathyroid adenomas is not uncommon (3-4% of all parathyroid adenomas). A 42-year-old female diagnosed as having GH secreting pituitary adenoma presented with an ectopic mediastinal parathyroid adenoma located between left (Lt) pulmonary artery and Lt main bronchus. The aim of presenting this case is not to appreciate the rarity of the condition but to rather discuss some of the vital practical problems faced during its management. Patient presenting in endocrine OPD with nausea, vomiting, drowsiness and chronic constipation was investigated biochemically and with various imaging modalities and accordingly managed. Patient was also investigated from the perspective of MEN 1 syndrome. Results: Baseline routine investigations revealed hypercalcemia (corrected S. Ca- 16.9 mg/dl) due to primary hyperparathyroidism (PHP, PTH-1190 ng/L) with adenoma located between Lt main bronchus and Lt pulmonary artery. Patient was medically managed and after proper preoperative preparation, surgical excision by open thoracotomy was planned but two days before surgery she developed pulmonary embolism and was shifted to ICU where she died after 20 days. An accurate preoperative localization by various imaging procedures plays a decisive role in case of ectopic adenomas in the chest. Ectopic parathyroid adenomas are frequent cause of failed initial surgery. The best surgical approach to these ectopic adenomas is still controversial. Equally effective newer medical treatment modalities are also required in patients who are awaiting or are unfit for surgery. Lastly combination of MEN 1 with ectopic parathyroid adenoma is rare.
