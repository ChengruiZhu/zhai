Memory is critical to virtually all aspects of behavior, which may explain why memory is such a complex phenomenon involving numerous interacting mechanisms that operate across multiple brain regions. Many of these mechanisms cooperate to transform initially fragile memories into more permanent ones (memory consolidation). The process of memory consolidation starts at the level of individual synaptic connections, but it ultimately involves circuit reorganization in multiple brain regions. We show that there is a computational advantage in partitioning memory systems into subsystems that operate on different timescales. Individual subsystems cannot both store large amounts of information about new memories, and, at the same time, preserve older memories for long periods of time. Subsystems with highly plastic synapses (fast subsystems) are good at storing new memories but bad at retaining old ones, whereas subsystems with less plastic synapses (slow subsystems) can preserve old memories but cannot store detailed new memories. Here we propose a model of a multi-stage memory system that exhibits the good features of both its fast and its slow subsystems. Our model incorporates some of the important design principles of any memory system and allows us to interpret in a new way what we know about brain memory.
