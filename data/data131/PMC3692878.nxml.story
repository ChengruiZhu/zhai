The ILI screening not-documented (N/D) rate on September 27, 2009, was 75% (N/D = 781; ED visits = 1039). By November 25, the N/D rate had fallen to 11% and remained below 20% into July 2010. October 18, 2009 marked the first day that the daily positive (POS) ILI screen rate was at or above 10% of patient visits with a rate of 12% (POS = 139; ED visits = 1164). The POS rate sustained values >10% until November 25(peaking at 40% on October 28, 2009) reflecting influenza activity and informing public health and other decision makers. When all site screening rates were aggregated and compared to the intervention variables – e-mail reminders (OR = 2.176; 95% CI: 2.078–2.279), meetings (OR = 2.286; 95% CI: 2.089–2.501), media (OR = 4.894; 95% CI: 4.219–5.677), clinic awareness (OR = 1.145; 95% CI: 0.998–1.313) were positively associated with increased adherence. Where one-to-one reminders to document ILI screening were provided at one site, the ILI documentation increased (OR = 2.663; 95% CI: 2.260–3.138). E-mail reminders (OR = 0.852; 95% CI: 0.732–0.992) and meetings (OR = 0.696; 95% CI: 0.505–0.960) had less influence on ILI documentation when the single site was analyzed.
