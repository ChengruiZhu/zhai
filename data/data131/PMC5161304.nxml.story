DNA methylation is one of the most heavily studied epigenetic modifications, with active research into the topic taking place for over 30 years. Over that time a relationship between non-methylated stretches of genomic DNA and the regulation of nearby genes has been identified, and it was noted that approximately half of all human genes have an unexpectedly high number of unmethylated CpG dinucleotides in their promoters. Nevertheless, until relatively recently we havenâ€™t been able to directly measure methylation gnome-wide, leading to the widespread use of CpG-rich regions (or CpG Islands) as a proxy for unmethylated genomic regions. Fortunately, recently developed experiments finally allow us to look at DNA methylation genome-wide, and have shown that CpG islands do not overlap true non-methylated islands to the extent we would have hoped, especially in cold-blooded vertebrates. We show that by using these experimentally determined non-methylated regions as training data, we are able to improve the prediction of non-methylated regions genome-wide in comparison to classical CpG island prediction methods, in both warm-blooded and cold-blooded vertebrates. Additionally, we show that while CpG content is an important predictor of methylation status in warm-blooded vertebrates, in cold-blooded vertebrates higher predictive accuracy can be achieved using longer stretches of relatively AT-rich DNA sequence.
