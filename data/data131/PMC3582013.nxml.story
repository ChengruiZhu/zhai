People with metabolic syndrome are at high risk for developing cardiovascular disease. The present study aimed to determine the age related metabolic syndrome of hemodialysis patients. The biochemical parameters and demographic information were registered. The prevalence of metabolic syndrome was significantly high in ages 50-59 and 60-69 years in hemodialysis patients when compared with other age groups (P< 0.05). There was elevated frequency of metabolic syndrome from age 50-59 and 40-49 years in male and female hemodialysis patients, respectively. The frequency of metabolic syndrome in female subjects (65.27%) was higher than male (47.14%, P<0.05). The prevalence of metabolic syndrome was high in ages 50-59 years in males and females. There was a significant difference in hemodialysis patients with metabolic syndrome in ages 50-59 years in males and from ages 40-49, 50-59 and 60-69 years in females (P< 0.05). Our results show that 25.71%, 18.57% and 2.86% males and 36.11%, 20.83% and 8.33% females had three, four and five criteria for metabolic syndrome, respectively. The results of this study showed that females patients were more affected than males. This may depended on the specific lifestyle alterations among females and males patients in this area.
