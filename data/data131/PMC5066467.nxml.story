Due to an increasing number of cochlear implantations, quality control has become more important. In addition to intraoperative biophysical measurements, radiological imaging is another possibility. An upcoming technique regarding this is Cone Beam CT (CBCT). Sixty-five data sets (35 Nucleus Contour Advance–Cochlear; 30 Flex Soft–MedEl) of postoperative imaging by CBCT (Accu-I-tomo F17, Morita, Kyoto, Japan) underwent further evaluation. Insertion angle, height of the cochlea, distance of the electrode to the medial or lateral wall, angle between chorda tympani and facial nerve and the precise position of the electrode cable in the facial-chordal angle were determined. The typical difference between the perimodiolar and lateral course of the electrodes could also be shown in radiological measurements. This demonstrates the accuracy and advantage of CBCT in visualisation of small structures with fewer metal artifacts. Furthermore, in 75% of patients, the angle of the chorda and facial nerve could be visualised. Significant differences in dependence of the electrode type for the relation of them to the facial nerve could be seen. In conclusion, CBCT achieves reliable visualisation and detailed imaging-based measurements of the intracochlear position of different cochlea electrodes. Additionally, clinically known differences can be reproduced. Even visualisation of the position of the electrode in the chorda-facial angle is possible. Therefore, CBCT is a useful tool in intra- and postoperative control of cochlear implants.
