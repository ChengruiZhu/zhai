Quantitative trait loci (QTL) mapping is a genetic approach that allows the identification of genetic factors underlying a phenotype of interest. Genomic technologies such as DNA microarray and next-generation sequencing provide data that can be used for the analysis of multiple molecular phenotypes. For example, the expression levels of thousands of genes can be associated with subject-specific genome-wide genetic information in expression QTL mapping. Similarly, the genetic regulation of transcription factor binding or epigenetic mechanisms such as DNA methylation or chromatin structure has begun to be investigated. In particular, the mechanisms controlling chromatin accessibility have attracted special interest due to their importance in a variety of DNA regulation processes including recombination, repair, replication, and transcription. In this work, we sought to dissect the genetic architecture of chromatin accessibility regulation by harnessing the power of genetic and genomic techniques. By analyzing open (accessible) chromatin maps of multiple yeast individuals in association with their genetic backgrounds, we were able to characterize the regulatory structure of chromatin traits versus that of gene expression. Importantly, we observed that the genetic loci responsible for multiple open chromatin regions were enriched for known regulatory factors.
