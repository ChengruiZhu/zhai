Virtually all important biomedical knowledge is described in the published research literature, but Medline currently contains over 23 million articles and is growing at the rate of several hundred thousand new articles each year. In this environment, we need computational algorithms that can efficiently extract, aggregate, annotate and store information from the raw text. Because authors describe their results using natural language, descriptions of similar phenomena vary considerably with respect to both word choice and sentence structure. Any algorithm capable of mining the biomedical literature on a large scale must be able to overcome these differences and recognize when two different-looking statements are saying the same thing. Here we describe a novel algorithm, Ensemble Biclustering for Classification (EBC), that learns the structure of drug-gene relationships automatically from the unstructured text of biomedical research abstracts. By applying EBC to the entirety of Medline, we learn from the structure of the text itself approximately 20 key ways that drugs and genes can interact, discover new facts for two biomedical knowledge bases, and reveal rich and unexpected structure in how scientists describe drug-gene relationships.
