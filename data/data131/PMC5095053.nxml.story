 cell invasion of HCC. We hypothesize that surrounding tumor-associated stromal cells play a crucial role in 14-3-3σ-regulated HCC cell invasion. In this study, H68 fibroblasts, THP-1 and phorbol-12-myristate-13-acetate (PMA)-treated THP-1 (PMA-THP-1) cells were incubated with conditioned media of control (control-CM) and 14-3-3σ-overepxressing cells (14-3-3σ-CM), followed by co-culture with HCC cells. Invasiveness of HCC cells was examined by a Boyden chamber assay. HCC cells co-cultured with 14-3-3σ-CM treated cells significantly enhanced their invasive ability compared with control-CM treated cells. Moreover, incubation with 14-3-3σ-CM induced differential expression profiles of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) in fibroblasts (MMP-1, MMP-2, MMP-9, MMP-12 and MMP-14), THP-1 (MMP-1 and MMP-12) and PMA-THP-1 cells (MMP-2, MMP-12 and MMP-14). In contrast, silencing of 14-3-3σ by siRNA significantly abolished 14-3-3σ-CM induced MMPs. In addition, treatment with recombinant 14-3-3σ (r14-3-3σ) protein exhibits a similar expression profile of MMPs induced by 14-3-3σ-CM in fibroblasts, THP-1 and PMA-THP-1 cells. Finally, knockdown of aminopeptidase N (APN) significantly abrogated r14-3-3σ induced expression of MMPs in HS68 fibroblasts. These results suggest that HCC-secreted 14-3-3σ promotes expression of MMPs in cancerous surrounding cells
