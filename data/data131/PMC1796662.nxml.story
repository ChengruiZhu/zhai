The hydrolysis of Adenosine triphosphate (ATP) provides the energy for most life processes, including the motility of molecular motors. How the chemical energy of hydrolysis is converted into mechanical work in these fascinating “nanomachines” is a central question that has only been answered in an outline form for almost all molecular motors. The fundamental challenge is that the working cycle of molecular motors involves processes of different physicochemical natures and scales, including ATP chemistry and protein structural transitions of diverse magnitudes (from a few Angstroms to a few nanometers), which makes mechanistic analysis using experiments alone difficult. Combined with previous computational studies from this lab, molecular dynamics simulations help identify energetic and structural properties of myosin, a prototypical molecular motor, that are essential to its energy conversion function. In addition to the role of flexibilities at the domain scale, which has been emphasized in previous studies of similar systems, the current results highlight the comparable significance of local flexibilities and how these flexibilities at different scales are modulated by ATP chemistry.
