Hyaluronan is a natural sugar polymer in our bodies. Besides acting as a space-filling agent for example in multiple connective tissues, it also functions as a cellular cue in cancer and inflammation. Our tissues sense hyaluronan through receptors—proteins that sit at the surface of cells and grab the molecules they are expected to recognize. Although the knowledge associated with hyaluronan and its receptors is constantly accumulating, the molecular-level insight is largely missing or incomplete due to the lack of techniques able to probe the dynamics of protein–carbohydrate interactions with sufficiently high resolution. In this work, we characterize the binding of hyaluronan to its receptor CD44 with atomistic precision. We achieve this level of precision by employing atomistic molecular dynamics simulations. This computational technique allows one to follow the movement of atoms of a virtual system at scales beyond the resolution of any experimental technique. Our work specifically focuses on the different stages of hyaluronan–CD44 binding, and we observe the process to involve three different binding modes, making it more versatile than previously thought. Our insights, therefore, promote the understanding of the interplay between hyaluronan and HA, thereby fostering development of new drugs or inhibitors to malignancies, such as cancer metastasis.
