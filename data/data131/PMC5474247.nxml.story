In the current study, we developed a liver-specific GGT-overexpressing mice model by rapid injection pLIVE-GGT vector through tail vein and investigated the effects of GGT elevation on glucose metabolism and insulin sensitivity. The serum GGT activity was significantly increased after 7 days of pLIVE-GGT1 vector delivery and lasted for about 3 weeks. GGT overexpression reduced the levels of GSSG and GSH in the liver and serum and had no effects on total antioxidative capacity in the liver, kidney, and skeletal muscle except for the pancreas. Increased GGT activity had no effect on the glucose tolerance but could facilitate blood glucose lowering after intraperitoneal insulin administration. The results of Western blotting showed that increased GGT activity enhanced insulin-induced AKT phosphorylation at Ser473. Furthermore, GGT inhibitor could attenuate the changes of insulin-induced blood glucose uptake and AKT phosphorylation in the liver. In summary, the present study developed a liver-specific GGT-overexpressing mice model and found that GGT elevation in short term had no effects on glucose metabolism but could increase insulin sensitivity through enhancing the activity of insulin signaling pathway.
