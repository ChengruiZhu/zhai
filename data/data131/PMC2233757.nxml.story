Insects detect sugars and amino acids by a specialized taste cell, the sugar receptor cell, in the taste hairs located on their labela and tarsi. We patch-clamped sensory processes of taste cells regenerated from the cut end of the taste hairs on the labelum of the flashfly isolated from the pupa ∼20 h before emergence. We recorded both single channel and ensemble currents of novel ion channels located on the distal membrane of the sensory process of the sugar receptor cell. In the stable outside-out patch membrane excised from the sensory processes, we could repeatedly record sucrose-induced currents for tens of minutes without appreciable decrease. An inhibitor of G-protein activation, GDP-β-S, did not significantly decrease the sucrose response. These results strongly suggested that the channel is an ionotropic receptor (a receptor/channel complex), activated directly by sucrose without mediation by second messengers or G protein. The channel was shown to be a nonselective cation channel. Analyses of single channel currents showed that the sucrose-gated channel has a single channel conductance of ∼30 pS and has a very short mean open time of ∼0.23 ms. It is inhibited by external Ca
