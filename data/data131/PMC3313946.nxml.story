Reasoning, learning, and creativity are hallmarks of human intelligence. These abilities involve the frontal lobe of the brain, but it remains unclear how the frontal lobes function in uncertain or open-ended situations. We propose here a computational model of human executive function that integrates multiple processes during decision-making, such as expectedness of uncertainty, task switching, and reinforcement learning. The model was tested in behavioral experiments and accounts for human decisions and their variations across individuals. The model reveals that executive function is capable of monitoring three or four concurrent behavioral strategies and infers online strategies' ability to predict action outcomes. If one strategy appears to reliably predict action outcomes, then it is chosen and possibly adjusted; otherwise a new strategy is tentatively formed, probed, and chosen instead. Thus, human frontal function has a monitoring capacity limited to three or four behavioral strategies. The results support a model of frontal executive function that explains the role and limitations of human reasoning, learning, and creative abilities in decision-making and adaptive behavior.
