Overall 46.3 per cent and 48.6 per cent of infants under six months of age were exclusively breastfed in NFHS-1 and NFHS-3 respectively. The proportion declined with each additional month of age, and at four months only 24 per cent infants in NFHS-1 and 31 per cent infants in NFHS-3 were exclusively breastfeeding. In the NFHS-1 a higher proportion of infants perceived to be small size at birth and those with mothers in gainful employment were exclusively breastfed. While in infants of mothers living in urban areas, older mothers (aged ≥ 35 years), more literate mothers, belonging to a higher standard of living index, preceding birth interval less than two years, and in those who had antenatal/natal care, a lower proportion of exclusive breastfeeding was observed at different ages of the infant. However, in the NFHS-3, children of older mothers and of those who were less educated the proportion of exclusive breastfeeding was significantly greater at one month of age. In the age segment one to four months; exclusive breastfeeding was significantly lower in infants born to older mothers, from medium standard of living households and perceived to be of small size at birth. Infants of mothers who were more educated, aged ≥ 35 years, living in urban areas and who had antenatal/natal care were the factors associated with a lower proportion of exclusive breastfeeding at six months of age.
