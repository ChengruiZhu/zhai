The objectives of the present study were twofold: to determine differences between groups by means of chosen coefficients and to create significant predictors using regression models for athletes in wheelchair rugby who had the same spinal cord injury (tetraplegia) and were classified as low point and high point players. The study sample consisted of 24 subjects, who had sustained cervical spinal cord injury (CSCI). They were divided into low point (n=15) and high point (n=9) groups according to the IWRF Classification System. A one-way ANOVA revealed statistically significant differences in the following coefficients differentiating the groups: AC (η2=0.778), LC (η2=0.687), IC (η2=0.565), SC (η2=0.580). The Tukey’s HSD post-hoc test indicated statistically significant higher values of coefficients in the HP compared to the LP group: AC=0.958 (p=0.022), LC=0.989 (p=0.031), IC=0.971 (p=0.044), SC=0.938 (p=0.039). In the HP group, the most significant predictor was the sum of visceral and trunk fat which was negatively correlated with the SC (what constituted a positive adaptive change in response to training). With regard to the LP group, body height and circumference of the chest appeared to be most significant predictors and were positively correlated with the SC. In the LP group no predictor with respect to the SC was significantly correlated to sports training. Therefore, the functional classification system confirmed lower status of the LP players. The results of the present study indicate that both metabolic and somatic profiles which highly determine potential of wheelchair rugby athletes are significantly different in LP and HP players, what confirms the reliability of the functional classification system.
