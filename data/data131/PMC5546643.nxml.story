Pulmonary cryptococcosis is commonly found in immunocompromised patients. This microorganism rarely infects immunocompetent individuals, and when it does, it causes mild symptoms. The radiological findings of this disease may involve an intrapulmonary mass that mimics lung tumor. The objective of this study was to review the clinicopathological information, radiological findings, and treatment of patients who presented with intrapulmonary mass due to cryptococcosis. This study collected data from 7 patients who were treated at Songklanagarind Hospital, Songkhla, Thailand, between 2009 and 2014. Their clinical data, radiological findings, pathological results, and treatment protocols were reviewed. The patients were 2 women and 5 men, ranging in age from 37 to 79â€‰years old. One case was an immunocompromised host. Four cases experienced the chest symptoms of dyspnea, hemoptysis, and chronic cough. The most common location of mass was the left lower lobe (71%). Four cases had a history of bird contact. Lung lobectomy was performed in 3 cases (42%), and all of the patients were treated with oral fluconazole. An intrapulmonary mass caused by this microorganism is mainly found in immunocompetent patients. Treatment with the antifungal drug fluconazole is very effective.
