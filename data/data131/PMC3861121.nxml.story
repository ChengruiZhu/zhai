It is well known that light suppresses hypocotyl growth in seedlings, while the phytohormone ethylene and its precursor 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylate (ACC) enhance hypocotyl growth in the light. However, the mechanism by which light and ethylene oppositely affect this process at the protein level is unclear. Here, we demonstrate that ethylene enhances the movement of CONSTITUTIVE PHOTOMORPHOGENESIS 1 (COP1) to the nucleus where it promotes the degradation of LONG HYPOCOTYL 5 (HY5) in the light, contributing to hypocotyl growth. Our data indicate that HY5 is required for ethylene-promoted hypocotyl growth in the light, but not in the dark. Using genetic and biochemical analyses, we found that HY5 functions downstream of ETHYLENE INSENSITIVE 3 (EIN3) during ethylene-promoted hypocotyl growth. Further, the regulation of HY5 stability by ethylene is COP1-dependent, and COP1 is genetically located downstream of EIN3, indicating that the COP1-HY5 complex integrates light and ethylene signalling downstream of EIN3. Importantly, ACC enriched the nuclear localisation of COP1 in an EIN3-dependent manner in the presence of light, suggesting that ethylene rescued the effects of light on the movement of COP1 from the cytoplasm to the nucleus. Thus, our investigation shows that the COP1-HY5 complex is a novel integrator that plays an essential role in ethylene-promoted hypocotyl growth in the light.
