 αβ T cells. These cells were also critical to adhesion formation associated with experimental intraabdominal sepsis. T cell transfer studies with mice deficient in signal transducer and activator of transcription (Stat)4 and Stat6 revealed that adhesion formation was dependent on a T helper 1 response. Activated T cells homed to the peritoneal cavity 6 hours after cecal abrasion surgery and predominated at this site during adhesiogenesis. Increased levels of the T cell–derived proinflammatory cytokine interleukin (IL)-17 and of neutrophil chemoattractant CXC chemokines macrophage inflammatory protein-2/CXCL8 and cytokine-induced neutrophil chemoattractant/CXCL1 were associated with adhesion formation. The production of these chemokines was dependent on T cells. Furthermore, the administration of neutralizing antibodies specific for IL-17 or the receptor that binds these CXC chemokines, CXC chemokine receptor 2, significantly reduced the degree of adhesion formation. These results demonstrate for the first time that the immunopathogenesis of adhesion formation is under the control of T cells and that T cell–derived cytokines and chemokines play important roles in the development of this deleterious host response.
