DNA double strand breaks (DSBs) are abrasions caused in both strands of the DNA duplex following exposure to both exogenous and endogenous conditions. Such abrasions have deleterious effect in cells leading to genome rearrangements and cell death. A number of repair systems including homologous recombination (HR) and non-homologous end-joining (NHEJ) have been evolved to minimize the fatal effects of these lesions in cell. The role of protein coding genes in regulation of these pathways has been assessed previously. However, a number of recent studies have focused on evaluation of non-coding RNAs participation in DNA repair. We performed a computerized search of the Medline/ Pubmed databases with key words: DNA repair, homologous recombination, non-homologues end joining and long non-coding RNA (LncRNA). The existing data highlight the role of long non-coding RNAs in DSB repair as well as dysregulation in their expression which would lead to pathological conditions such as cancer. The specific mechanism of their contribution in DNA repair pathways has been elucidated for a few of them. LncRNAs participate in several steps of DNA repair pathways and regulate the expression of key components of these pathways including p53 tumor suppressor gene.
