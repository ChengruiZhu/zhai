Here we use molecular dynamics simulation to compare the mechanical properties of the 7-ankyrin-repeat oncoprotein Gankyrin in isolation and in complex with binding partner S6-C. Tandem repeat proteins like Gankyrin comprise tandem arrays of small structural motifs that pack linearly to produce elongated architectures. They are elastic, mechanically weak molecules and they unfold and refold repeat by repeat under force. We show that S6-C binding greatly increases the resistance of Gankyrin to mechanical stress. The enhanced mechanical stability is specific to those ankyrin repeats in contact with S6-C, and the localized nature of the effect results in fundamental changes in the way the protein responds to force. Thus, the forced unfolding of isolated Gankryin involves a diverse set of pathways with a preference for a C- to N-terminus unfolding mechanism whereas this diversity is reduced upon complex formation with the central repeats, which are those most tightly bound to the ligand, tending to unfold last. Our study shows how stepwise unfolding can buffer repeat proteins and their binding partners from mechanical stress in the cell. It also points to a mechano-switching mechanism whereby binding between two partner macromolecules is regulated by mechanical stress.
