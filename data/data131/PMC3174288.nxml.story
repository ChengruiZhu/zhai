The survival of acetabular components depends on several factors: wear, osteolysis and septic or aseptic loosening. Osteolysis seems to be the main cause for concern in cementless arthroplasties. Acetabular osteolysis results from particle debris and segmental unloading of acetabular bone by rigid sockets. We investigated a cementless elastic monoblock socket with regard to acetabular osteolysis and aseptic loosening in a cohort of young patients. We evaluated 158 hip arthroplasties with a minimum follow-up of ten years (ten to 18) and a mean age of 42 years (18–50). The overall revision rate at 14 years was 80% with a 98% survival rate for aseptic loosening. The mean polyethylene wear rate was 0.11 mm/year. Progressive acetabular osteolysis was seen in 3% of patients evaluated. In conclusion, we found low pelvic osteolysis rates, acceptable overall wear rates, satisfactory overall survival and excellent survival rates for aseptic loosening of a cementless elastic monoblock socket in patients younger than 50 years. Ongoing tribology developments and knowledge about acetabular bone adaptations behind acetabular implants will further lower wear and osteolysis rates and optimise survival rates of cementless sockets.
