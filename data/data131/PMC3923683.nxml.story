Bardet-Biedl syndrome (BBS) is a genetically heterogeneous autosomal recessive ciliopathy with 18 causative genes reported to date. The syndrome is characterized by obesity, polydactyly, renal defects, hypogenitalism and retinal degeneration. Previous work has illustrated a role for BBS proteins in the trafficking of ciliary cargo proteins including MCHR1, SSTR3, and dopamine receptor 1. In addition, interaction of BBS proteins with other centriolar satellite proteins has been reported. In order to identify novel BBS interacting proteins and novel BBS candidate genes we generated a transgenic BBS4 mouse. In this study, we utilized the transgenic mice to identify a novel BBSome (a complex of eight BBS proteins) interacting protein, AZI1. We show that AZI1 physically binds to the BBSome via BBS4. We also suggest a negative role of AZI1 in ciliary trafficking of the BBSome: when AZI1 is depleted, more BBSome localizes to cilia. Using zebrafish as a model, we show that azi1 morphants are similar to bbs morphants, a finding that further implicates AZI1 with the BBS pathway. Our findings provide further insight into the regulation of BBSome ciliary trafficking and identify AZI1 as a BBS candidate gene.
