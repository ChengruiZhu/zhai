Imatinib mesylate, showed encouraging activity in chronic myelogenous leukemia. However, there are few data regarding his efficacy and response monitoring in Sub-Saharan African patients. Our objective was to assess response to imatinib mesylate (Glivec) in Côte d'Ivoire patients with newly diagnosed Chronic Myeloid Leukemia (CML). From May 2005 to September 2009, we treated 42 patients (40 years; range 16–69) with Philadelphia chromosome (Ph+) positive in chronic phase CML with oral imatinib mesylate at daily doses of 400 mg. Overall survival (OS) and frequency of complete or major cytogenetic remission (CCR/MCR) were evaluated. At a median follow up of 32 (range 7.6–113) months, the CHR rate in our study group was 76%. A major CR was found in 19 patients (45%) with 17% and 29% complete and partial CR respectively. There were no significant differences in the incidence of major cytogenetic response by known prognostics factors. Median time to CHR was 8 months (range 0.4–25), and 16 months (range: 0.1–36) for CR. Projected 5-year OS rate was 72% (95%CI 42–88). We conclude that imatinib therapy sub-Saharan African CML patients is very promising and has favorably changed the prognosis for black African patients with CML.
