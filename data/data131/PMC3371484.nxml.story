Insulinoma is a rare neuroendocrine tumour of the pancreas , which is usually small, solitary and benign. It may be part of the multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 syndrome. It is diagnosed by clinical, biochemical and imaging modalities. Hypoglycaemic symptoms can be medically controlled by diazoxide or somatostatin analogues. Localisation of the tumour is a challenge to clinicians. Surgical resection is the curative treatment with a high success rate. Intraoperatively, ultrasound and surgical palpation help to confirm the site of tumour. Intraoperatively, maintenance of optimum glucose levels is of main concern because there may be severe hypoglycemia while handling the tumour, symptoms of which remain masked under general anaesthesia. Glucose infusion and frequent plasma glucose monitoring to maintain plasma glucose level more than 60 mg/dL is found to be helpful. We performed a systematic search in PubMed, Cochrane Library and also in Google. We used the following text words for our search: Insulinoma, neuro-endocrine tumors, multiple endocrine neoplasia, hypoglycemia, anaesthetic management of insulinoma, glucose management. In this article, we review the incidence and epidemiology of insulinoma, its clinical features, diagnosis, localisation and treatment, with special emphasis on anaesthetic management.
