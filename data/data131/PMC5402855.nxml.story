The subjects were 5 patients ≥65 years of age with refractory UC who had received oral tacrolimus as remission induction therapy between 2009 and 2014 (3 men and 2 women; median age at onset, 75 years). At the start of the tacrolimus treatment, the median duration of disease was 3 months, and the type of UC was total colitis in 4 cases, and left-sided colitis in 1 case. The drugs used concomitantly at the start of tacrolimus treatment were mesalazine (5 cases) and an immunomodulator drug (1 case). Standard induction therapy (0.05 mg/kg/day) was used in 2 patients and rapid induction therapy (0.1 mg/kg/day) was used in the remaining 3 patients. One week after the start of treatment, the blood trough concentrations of tacrolimus were over the target level of 15 mg/mL in 4 patients. The clinical activity index values on day 0 and day 14 were 10.6±2.1 and 7.6±3.4, respectively. The ulcerative colitis endoscopic index of severity in the remaining 3 patients, after excluding the 2 patients who required colectomy within 14 days after the start of tacrolimus therapy, was 7.3±1.0 before the start of the tacrolimus treatment, improving to 4.5±0.5 on day 14. Subsequently, 1 of these 3 patients was also judged to need surgery due to symptom exacerbation, while complete remission was maintained in the other 2 patients.
