Inflammatory pseudotumour is a rare condition that can affect various organs. The clinical and histologic appearance of the pseudotumour may mimic haematological, lymphoproliferative, paraneoplastic or malignant processes. A previously healthy 39-year-old man presented with nephrotic syndrome. He had a history of headaches, nausea and swollen ankles. Computed tomography of the abdomen revealed a 6-cm mass in the spleen. Following a renal biopsy, a diagnosis of membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis (MPGN) type I was made. Splenectomy was performed and the examination revealed a mixed population of lymphocytes with predominantly T-cells, B-cells and lymphoplasmacytoid cells. Immunostaining confirmed that the small cells were mostly T-cells positive for all T-cell markers including CD2, CD3, CD4, CD5, CD7 and CD8. A diagnosis of inflammatory pseudotumour was established. The removal of the spleen was followed by remission of glomerulonephritis, but it was complicated by a subphrenic abscess and pneumonia. This association between an inflammatory pseudotumour of the spleen and MPGN has not been previously described. Abnormal immune response due to the inflammation leading to secondary glomerulonephritis might be the main pathogenic mechanism.
