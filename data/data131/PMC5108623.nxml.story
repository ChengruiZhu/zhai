Targeted drug delivery to outer hair cells (OHCs) in the cochlea by nanomedicine strategies forms an effective therapeutic approach for treating hearing loss. Surface chemistry plays a deciding role in nanoparticle (NP) biodistribution, but its influence on such distribution in the cochlea remains largely unknown. Herein, we report the first systematic comparison of poly(lactic/glycolic acid) nanoparticles (PLGA NPs) with or without surface modification of hydrophilic molecules for optimizing the delivery to OHCs both in vitro and in vivo. NPs that were surface modified with poloxamer 407 (P407), chitosan, or methoxy poly(ethylene glycol) and the unmodified NPs were highly biocompatible with L929 and House Ear Institute-organ of Corti 1 cells as well as cochlear tissues. Interestingly, among all the examined NPs, P407-PLGA NPs showed the greatest cellular uptake and prominent fluorescence in cochlear imaging. More importantly, we provide novel evidence that the surface-modified NPs reached the organ of Corti and were transported into the OHCs at a higher level. Together, these observations suggest that surface modification with hydrophilic molecules will allow future clinical applications of PLGA NPs, especially P407-PLGA NPs, in efficient hearing loss therapy.
