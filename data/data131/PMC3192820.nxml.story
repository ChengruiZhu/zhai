Food security of millions of people in the third world has faced a growing number of challenges in recent years including risks associated with emergent agricultural pests. Worldwide, the promotion of integrated pest management practices has been heavily promoted through participative methodologies relying on farmer cooperation to share pest control information. Recent studies have put into doubt the efficiency of such methodologies evoking our poor knowledge of farmers' perceptions, behavioral heterogeneity, and complex interaction with pest dynamics. While pest management programs have a larger place than ever on the international policy agenda, the debate concerning their efficiency at large scales has remained unresolved. Here, we developed an innovative modeling approach coupling pest control information diffusion and pest population dynamics to study the role of cooperation among farmers to share the information. We found that the slow learning process placed restrictions on the knowledge that could be generated within farmer communities over time, giving rise to natural lags in pest control diffusion and applications. However, our model also predicts that if individuals learn from others about the benefits of early prevention of invasive pests, then a temporary educational effort may have a sustainable long-run impact.
