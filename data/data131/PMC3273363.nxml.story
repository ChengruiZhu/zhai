Premature ejaculation (PE) is a major issue in male sexual health. The global prevalence of PE is estimated to be between 20% and 40%, making it the most common sexual dysfunction in men. PE causes distress and reduced quality of life for patients and has a negative impact on interpersonal relationships. Historically, it has been treated with cognitive therapy, behavioral methods, and off-label use of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors usually used to treat depression and other psychological disorders. Dapoxetine is a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor specifically designed to treat PE. This paper reviews the current evidence for use of dapoxetine in the treatment of PE in adult men. There is substantial evidence that dapoxetine 30 mg or 60 mg taken “on-demand” results in a significant increase in intravaginal ejaculatory latency time when compared with placebo. Patient-reported outcomes are clearly improved relative to placebo following dapoxetine therapy, indicating greater control over ejaculation, more satisfaction with intercourse, less ejaculation-related distress, and, importantly, significantly reduced interpersonal difficulty. These data were supported by consistent reports of improvement in Clinical Global Impression of change in PE following treatment with dapoxetine. Further studies are needed to evaluate long-term efficacy and health economics. The unique pharmacology of dapoxetine makes it ideal for on-demand dosing, and the clinical evidence shows dapoxetine to be an efficacious and tolerable treatment for lifelong and acquired PE.
