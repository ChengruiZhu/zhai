 (SA) is the most common cause of skin and soft tissue infections (SSTIs) and nosocomial infections. In developed countries there is a major concern about the rise of community-associated methicillin-resistant SA (CA-MRSA), but data from developing countries are scarce. In this study we describe the prevalence and antibiotic susceptibility of CA-MRSA and healthcare-associated MRSA (HA-MRSA) in a district hospital from rural India. We identified 119 CA-SA infections and 82 HA-SA infections. The majority of infections were SSTI, and the proportion of MRSA in CA-SA and HA-SA infections was 64.7% and 70.7%, respectively. The proportion of CA-MRSA in children <5 years was 73.7%. We did not observe any linezolid or vancomycin resistance. CA-SA had high levels of resistance to ciprofloxacin and low levels of resistance to chloramphenicol, doxycycline, rifampicin, and clindamycin. CA-MRSA had higher proportion of resistance to ciprofloxacin, erythromycin, gentamicin, and cotrimoxazole than CA methicillin-susceptible SA (CA-MSSA). HA-MRSA had higher proportion of resistance to clindamycin and doxycycline than CA-MRSA. The results of this study indicate that MRSA is replacing MSSA in CA-SA infections. If these findings are confirmed by other studies, the spread of CA-MRSA can be a major public health problem in India.
