Bone tissue engineering provides a substitute for bone transplantation in spinal fusion. This study examined if combined bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs) sheet with platelet-rich plasma (PRP) could promote bone regeneration in a rabbit posterolateral spinal fusion model. BMSCs was isolated and confirmed by Flow cytometric analysis and immunofluorescence staining. The morphology of BMSCs was examined by Hematoxylin and Eosin staining, scanning and transmission electron microscopy. BMSCs were cultured in induction medium or control medium. The osteogenic ability of BMSCs was investigated by various histochemical staining, immunofluorescence staining and qRT-PCR analysis. The BMSCs/PRP was constructed by encapsulating the PRP block with BMSCs sheet. Twenty-four adult rabbits were randomly divided into four groups based on the implanted biomaterials: BMSCs/PRP, BMSCs, iliac crest autograft, and control group. Manual palpation and digital radiography analysis showed that the fusion rate was 100%, 0, 83.3%, and 0 in these 4 groups, respectively. Formation of continuous bone masses in BMSCs/PRP group was confirmed by computed tomography scanning and 3D-reconstruction. These studies demonstrated that BSMCs/PRP significantly accelerated bone regeneration in the rabbit posterolateral spinal fusion model.
