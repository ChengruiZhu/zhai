 contends the change will improve epilepsy's image. Some clinicians and other organizations fear the change may not though be accepted by patients as in common parlance “disease” can be associated with “contagiousness”/”infection.” To allow practicing clinicians to make informed judgements about what language they use, we completed the first study to assess the preferences of those with epilepsy and significant others and explore if any of their characteristics were associated with preference. Via epilepsy interest groups and associations in England, Wales, Scotland and the Republic of Ireland, 971 patients and significant others were surveyed. Participants identified which of four labels for epilepsy (“disorder,” “illness,” “disease,” “condition”) they favoured and rated each using a Likert‐scale.
