Production of metastasis capable precursors begins within the primary tumor. Here, we define the bidirectional interactions with stromal cells involved in promoting these precursors within BRCA1-IRIS (hereafter IRIS) overexpressing (IRISOE) TNBC tumors. We define an aggressiveness niche, functionally defined as the necrotic/hypoxic core of the tumor, in which metabolically stressed, hypoxic, and inflamed IRISOE TNBC cells secrete higher levels of cytokines, chemokines and growth factors. One cytokine; IL-1β attracts mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) to the niche and activates them to secrete CXCL1 that entrains IRISOE cells to secrete higher levels of CCL2 and VEGF. CCL2 attracts macrophages (TAMs) to the niche and activates them to secrete S100A8, and VEGF attracts endothelial cells (ECs) and activates them to secrete IL-8. In concert, CXCL1, S100A8 and IL-8 entrain aggressiveness in IRISOE TNBC cells within the niche. Indeed, compared to IRISOE cells alone, tumors developed by co-injecting IRISOE cells admixed with MSCs (10:1) in athymic mice were bigger and more aggressive. They contained more TAMs and ECs, expressed higher-levels of basal, epithelial to mesenchymal transition, and stemness biomarkers, quickly progressed to lymph-node or visceral metastases, and were highly sensitive to the IL-1β inhibitor “Anakinra”. Our findings supported by human data show that breast cancer patients with high-levels of IL-1β, CXCL1, CCL2, S100A8, VEGF, and IL-8 would show worse clinical outcomes. Our findings argue that this cytokine set is a diagnostic biomarker for patients who may benefit from an IRIS inhibitor-based therapy, and is a blue print for translation of approaches to combining that therapy with inhibitors of these bidirectional interactions to overcome TNBC metastasis.
