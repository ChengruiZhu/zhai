The researchers identified 24 FDA-registered premarketing trials that investigated the use of eight second-generation antipsychotics for the treatment of schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder. They searched the published literature for reports of these trials, and, by comparing the results of these trials according to the FDA with the results in the published articles, they examined the relationship between the study outcome (did the FDA consider it positive or negative?) and publication and looked for outcome reporting bias. Four of the 24 FDA-registered trials were unpublished. Three of these unpublished trials failed to show that the study drug was more effective than a placebo (a “dummy” pill); the fourth showed that the study drug was inferior to another drug already in use in the US. Among the 20 published trials, the five that the FDA judged not positive showed some evidence of publication bias. However, the association between trial outcome and publication status did not reach statistical significance (it might have happened by chance), and the mean effect size (a measure of drug effectiveness) derived from the published literature was only slightly higher than that derived from the FDA records. By contrast, within the FDA dataset, the mean effect size of the published trials was approximately double that of the unpublished trials.
