Recent studies suggest that the presence of a KRAS mutation may be insufficient for defining a clinically homogenous molecular group, as many KRAS mutant tumors lose reliance on K-Ras for survival. Identifying pathways that support K-Ras dependency may define clinically relevant KRAS sub-groups and lead to the identification of new drug targets. We have analyzed a panel of 17 KRAS mutant lung cancer cell lines classified as K-Ras dependent or independent, for co-dependency on PKCδ. We show that functional dependency on K-Ras and PKCδ co-segregate, and that dependency correlates with a more epithelial-like phenotype. Furthermore, we show that the pro-apoptotic and pro-tumorigenic functions of PKCδ also segregate based on K-Ras dependency, as K-Ras independent cells are more sensitive to topoisomerase inhibitors, and depletion of PKCδ in this sub-group suppresses apoptosis through increased activation of ERK. In contrast, K-Ras dependent lung cancer cells are largely insensitive to topoisomerase inhibitors, and depletion of PKCδ can increase apoptosis and decrease activation of ERK in this sub-group. We have previously shown that nuclear translocation of PKCδ is necessary and sufficient for pro-apoptotic signaling. Our current studies show that K-Ras dependent cells are refractive to PKCδ driven apoptosis. Analysis of this sub-group showed increased PKCδ expression and an increase in the nuclear:cytoplasmic ratio of PKCδ. In addition, targeting PKCδ to the nucleus induces apoptosis in K-Ras independent, but not K-Ras dependent NSCLC cells. Our studies provide tools for identification of the subset of patients with KRAS mutant tumors most amenable to targeting of the K-Ras pathway, and identify PKCδ as a potential target in this tumor population. These sub-groups are likely to be of clinical relevance, as high PKCδ expression correlates with increased overall survival and a more epithelial tumor phenotype in patients with KRAS mutant lung adenocarcinomas.
