Cerebral cortex is an outer layer of the brain in mammals, and it plays a critical part in various cognitive processes such as learning, memory, attention, language, and consciousness. The cerebral cortex contains a number of neuroanatomical parameters whose values are essentially conserved across species and brain sizes, which suggests that these particular parameters are somehow important for brain efficient functioning. This study shows that the fractional volumes of five major cortical components both neuronal and non-neuronal (axons, dendrites, spines, glia/astrocytes, capillaries) are also approximately conserved across mammals, and neural wire (axons and dendrites) occupies the most of cortical space. Moreover, the fractional volumes form a special hierarchy of dependencies, being approximately equal to integer powers of 1/3. Is there any evolutionary principle of cortical organization that would explain these properties? This study finds that there are two different theoretical principles that can provide answers: one standard related to minimization of neural wire fractional volume, and a new proposition associated with economical maximization of spine content. However, the latter principle produces more robust results, which suggests that spine economical maximization is potentially an alternative to the more common “wire minimization” in explaining the cortical layout. Therefore, the current study can become an important contribution to our understanding (or debating) of the main factors influencing the evolution of local cortical circuits in the brain.
