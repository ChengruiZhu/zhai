All animals need energy to fuel development and survive as adults. Excess energy stored as fat provides a means to endure periods when external energy is unavailable, but there is a delicate balance between accumulating sufficient fat stores and becoming obese. While the enzymes that mediate energy deposition into and mobilization from fat stores are well studied, the complex upstream regulatory pathways have not been fully worked out. We report here that two members of a conserved family of RNA-binding proteins, Spen and Nito, operate in fat storage cells in fruit fly larvae to control the expression of genes that mediate energy liberation from fat stores. Manipulating Spen or Spenito function grossly perturbs larval energy metabolism, including imbalances in the amounts of stored fats, key metabolites, and metabolic enzymes, and resulting in defects in survival under starvation conditions. Interestingly, Nito opposes Spen functions, indicative of a regulatory mechanism that helps keep energy balance in check. We find that the mouse homologs of Spen and Nito, which were known to regulate gene expression in other pathways, respond similarly to changes in body fat induced by a high-fat diet, suggesting that the balancing effect of these two proteins also prevents mammalian obesity.
