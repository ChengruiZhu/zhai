Globalisation, scientific and technical progress are the basis of numerous innovative therapies for oncologic and non-oncologic diseases. It is another matter how much and by whom they are desired, and whether they have to be applied. When and how often? Innovative approaches should go towards simplification, universal distribution and application while at the same time analysis between the potential initial investment and the achieved final result should be made. An illustrative example for this is the targeted therapy for melanoma with its low baseline criteria or basic rules for its surgical treatment. Another example could be the confocal microscopy in the context of dysplastic nevus syndrome. Therapies for various autoimmune diseases should also be considered critically. In the current OAMJMS issue, as well as in some of our other ideas and statements reported also in OAMJMS, we are trying to answer at least to a part of these dilemmas, to provoke a critical point of view and to ask some simple questions: â€œShould any innovation be considered as a face value? Which is potentially beneficial for our patients? How could we regulate the processes to minimise the need for expensive medications for certain diseases? And, of course, we are also turning to our own mistakes by visualising the results of them!
