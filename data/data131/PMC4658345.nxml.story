Lung cancer is the most common cancer type worldwide and the leading cause of cancer related deaths in the United States. The majority of newly diagnosed patients present with late stage metastatic lung cancer that is inoperable and resistant to therapies. High-throughput genomic technologies have made the identification of genetic mutations that promote lung cancer progression possible. Identification of the mutations that drive lung cancer provided new targets for non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) treatment and led to the development of targeted therapies such as tyrosine kinase inhibitors that can be used to combat the molecular changes that promote cancer progression. Development of targeted therapies is not the only clinical benefit of gene analysis studies. Biomarkers identified from gene analysis can be used for early lung cancer detection, determine patientâ€™s prognosis and response to therapy, and monitor disease progression. Biomarkers can be used to identify the NSCLC patient population that would most benefit from treatment (targeted therapies or chemotherapies), providing clinicians tools that can be used to develop a personalized treatment plan. This review explores the clinical potential of NSCLC genetic studies on diagnosing and treating NSCLC.
