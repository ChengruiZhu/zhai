Methyl-benzimidazole-2-ylcarbamate (MBC) inhibits the mitotic cell cycle of Saccharomyces cerevisiae at a stage subsequent to DNA synthesis and before the completion of nuclear division (Quinlan, R. A., C. I. Pogson, and K, Gull, 1980, J Cell Sci., 46: 341-352). The step in the cell cycle that is sensitive to MBC inhibition was ordered to reciprocal shift experiments with respect to the step catalyzed by cdc gene products. Execution of the CDC7 step is required for the initiation of DNA synthesis and for completion of the MBC-sensitive step. Results obtained with mutants (cdc2, 6, 8, 9, and 21) defective in DNA replication and with an inhibitor of DNA replication (hydroxyurea) suggest that some DNA replication required for execution of the MBC-sensitive step but that the completion of replication is not. Of particular interest were mutants (cdc5, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, and 23) that arrest cell division after DNA replication but before nuclear division since previous experiments had not been able to resolve the pathway of events in this part of the cell cycle. Execution of the CDC17 step was found to be a prerequisite for execution of the MBC- sensitive step; the CDC13, 16 and 23 steps are executed independently of the MBC-sensitive step; execution of the MBC-sensitive step is prerequisite for execution of the MBC-sensitive step; execution of the MBC-sensitive step is prerequisite for execution of the CDC14 and 23 steps. These results considerably extend the dependent pathway of events that constitute the cell cycle of S. cerevisiae.
