One advantage of studying sensory systems is that external stimuli can be readily controlled and quantified. Our internal perception of time, however, is not as easily approachable. To address this challenge, we developed a task that leverages our knowledge of the neuronal circuits underlying eye movements. Monkeys were trained to move their eyes consistently at regular time intervals without any external cueing or immediate expectation of reward. The animals were remarkably precise and consistent in their timing. Recordings from individual lateral intraparietal area (LIP) neurons, an area associated with eye movement planning, showed a linear decrease in activity between eye movements. This contrasts with previous studies that have reported increases in LIP activity immediately prior to eye movements and suggests that expectation of reward may have influenced such results. We also found that variations in this decreasing activity were predictive of the animalsâ€™ timing. Finally, we demonstrate through a simple model that LIP activity was sufficiently precise to completely explain the timing of the animals' actions. The model demonstrates that a precise internal sense of time can arise by comparing activity across different neuronal populations.
