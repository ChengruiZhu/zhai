Understanding the regulation of cell surface expression of specific peptide–major histocompatibility complex (MHC) complexes is hindered by the lack of direct quantitative analyses of specific peptide–MHC complexes. We have developed a direct quantitative biochemical approach by engineering soluble divalent T cell receptor analogues (TCR–Ig) that have high affinity for their cognate peptide–MHC ligands. The generality of this approach was demonstrated by specific staining of peptide-pulsed cells with two different TCR–Ig complexes: one specific for the murine alloantigen 2C, and one specific for a viral peptide from human T lymphocyte virus–1 presented by human histocompatibility leukocyte antigens–A2. Further, using 2C TCR– Ig, a more detailed analysis of the interaction with cognate peptide–MHC complexes revealed several interesting findings. Soluble divalent 2C TCR–Ig detected significant changes in the level of specific antigenic–peptide MHC cell surface expression in cells treated with γ-interferon (γ-IFN). Interestingly, the effects of γ-IFN on expression of specific peptide–MHC complexes recognized by 2C TCR–Ig were distinct from its effects on total H-2 L
