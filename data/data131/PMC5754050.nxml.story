The production of red blood cells, platelet-producing megakaryocytes, and immune response-directing granulocytes and monocytes is initiated at an early stage in the developing embryo and continues throughout life. The proportion of each cell type varies depending on the specific needs of the organism. We know that in the mouse embryo, specialized blood progenitor cells emerge in the fetal liver and produce mature blood cells in response to different cues. However, it is difficult to distinguish between red blood cell and white blood cell-producing progenitors with sufficiently high accuracy to study these cues. For example, we know that several childhood blood disorders, such as leukemias, are caused by genetic mutations in blood progenitor cells before birth, but studying the effects of these mutations in a mouse disease model is hampered if we donâ€™t know which blood progenitor cells to collect. We have used different genetic markers to help distinguish red blood cell, megakaryocyte and granulocyte/monocyte-producing progenitor cells with a greater precision than was previously possible. Furthermore, to illustrate how this technique can be used to study blood disorders, we demonstrated that mutations affecting the transcription factor
