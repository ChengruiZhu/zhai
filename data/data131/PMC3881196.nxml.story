 hybridization (FISH) for bladder cancer in light of the histological diagnosis. Several valuable observations using FISH technologies in voided urine cells were also reported. The multi-target FISH-containing probes for the centromeres of chromosomes 3, 7 and 17 and the 9p21 locus were applied to cytospin specimens prepared from voided urine. Urine samples from 53 bladder cancer patients and 30 patients with benign alterations were used for this study. The histological observations of surgical resection specimens showed that the specificity and sensitivity for the technique were 100.0 and 88.0%, respectively. Statistical analyses showed that there was no significant correlation between FISH-positive rate and the tumor stage/grade (P<0.05). However, the proportion of tumor cells with genetic abnormalities positively correlated with the tumor stage (P<0.01). Furthermore, the number of abnormal cells in muscle-invasive pT2 was significantly higher than that in non-muscle-invasive pTa, pT1 (P<0.01). Of 50 patients with bladder cancer, polysomies of chromosomes 3, 7 and 17 were detected in 84.0, 48.0 and 78.0% of cases, respectively, and loss of the 9p21 gene was detected in 80.0% of cases. In addition, the detailed results from different urine specimens showed that FISH assay was required. FISH assay for chromosomes 3, 7 and 17 and 9p21 has a high specificity and sensitivity in the detection of bladder cancer and may reduce the necessity for cytoscopy treatment.
