Extracellular bone material can be characterised as a nanocomposite where, in a liquid environment, nanometre-sized hydroxyapatite crystals precipitate within as well as between long fibre-like collagen fibrils (with diameters in the 100 nm range), as evidenced from neutron diffraction and transmission electron microscopy. Accordingly, these crystals are referred to as ‘interfibrillar mineral’ and ‘extrafibrillar mineral’, respectively. From a topological viewpoint, it is probable that the mineralisations start on the surfaces of the collagen fibrils (‘mineral-encrusted fibrils’), from where the crystals grow both into the fibril and into the extrafibrillar space. Since the mineral concentration depends on the pore spaces within the fibrils and between the fibrils (there is more space between them), the majority of the crystals (but clearly not all of them) typically lie in the extrafibrillar space. There, larger crystal agglomerations or clusters, spanning tens to hundreds of nanometers, develop in the course of mineralisation, and the micromechanics community has identified the pivotal role, which this extrafibrillar mineral plays for tissue elasticity. In such extrafibrillar crystal agglomerates, single crystals are stuck together, their surfaces being covered with very thin water layers. Recently, the latter have caught our interest regarding strength properties (
