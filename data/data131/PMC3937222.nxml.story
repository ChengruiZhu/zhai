 has emerged as an important model for the genetic analysis of aging, and insights gained about this process in yeast cells enhance our understanding of aging in other organisms, including humans. Even in yeast, our knowledge of the number and identity of the genes that determine lifespan is limited and we are still lacking a general picture of how different genetic aging factors work together. Here, using an innovative sensitive technique, we have characterized the stationary-phase survival of yeast single- and double-gene knockout mutants to screen for genes that control chronological aging and to score the genetic interactions among these genes. Our results showed that an important fraction (14%) of the genome contributes to the regulation of lifespan, including genes and pathways that had not been previously associated to this phenotype. We also constructed a genetic interaction map which recapitulated lifespan-determining pathways and highlighted genetic associations between the autophagy machinery and the phosphatidylinositol-phosphate and lipid-homeostasis pathways. Our study provides not only an accurate catalogue of yeast aging genes, but also a picture of the gene-network wiring of aging cells.
