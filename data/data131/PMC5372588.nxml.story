), 50 mg twice a day, or placebo, for six months. We evaluated: glycemic control, metalloproteinase-2, and -9 (MMP-2, and -9), soluble intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (sICAM-1), soluble vascular cell adhesion protein-1 (sVCAM-1), interleukin-6 (IL-6), soluble E-selectin (sE-selectin), high sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP), tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), and plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1). We recorded a decrease of MMP-2, MMP-9, sE-selectin, TNF-α, sVCAM-1, and IL-6 compared to baseline, and to placebo in the group treated with mesoglycan. Regarding sICAM-1, and hs-CRP, instead, we recorded a decrease with mesoglycan only compared to baseline. Preliminary results seem to suggest an improvement of pain free walking distance with mesoglycan in 18 patients both compared to baseline and to placebo, even if data should be taken cautiously. Our study showed that supplementation with mesoglycan improved endothelial dysfunction in type 2 diabetic patients with peripheral artery disease. Regarding the preliminary data suggesting also a slight improvement of clinical parameters such as pain free walking distance, more data and a bigger sample of patients are necessary to better verify this aspect.
