Meiosis is a specialized cell division that exactly halves the number of chromosomes transmitted from each parent to their offspring via gamete cells (such as sperm and eggs). This requires that matching (‘homologous’) chromosomes associate and then separate into different cells such that each gamete contains exactly one complete set of chromosomes. In many organisms, this sequence of events is facilitated by the induction and repair of chromosome breaks via a process called homologous recombination. As homologous chromosomes engage in recombination, matching DNA strands between broken and intact template chromosomes become intertwined in repair intermediates called Joint Molecules. In this study, we show that a highly conserved protein complex called the Structural Maintenance of Chromosomes 5/6 (Smc5/6) complex is important for regulating the choice of recombination template as well as for the resolution of Joint Molecules that is required for chromosomes to separate. Even though Joint Molecules remain unresolved in mutants that lack normal Smc5/6 function, cells still attempt to separate chromosomes and meiosis becomes catastrophic. Thus, Smc5/6 mutants have a two-fold defect: accumulation of unresolved Joint Molecules and a failure to stall meiosis in order to remove these structures.
