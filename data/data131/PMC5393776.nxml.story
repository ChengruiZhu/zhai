It has been suggested that certain facial expressions are subject to enhanced processing to maximize the speed and accuracy with which humans locate individuals posing an imminant threat. Evidence supporting this proposal comes largely from visual search tasks which have demonstrated that threatening expressions are more rapidly detected than nonthreatening ones. An open criticism of this effect is that it may be due to low-level visual artifacts, rather than biological preparedness. One successful approach for controlling low-level, image-based differences has been to use schematic faces (simplified line drawings). We report experiments aimed at discovering whether the enhanced processing of threatening schematic faces, might also be due to low-level features. The first study replicated the standard threat search advantage, but also measured an effect using similar stimuli comprised of obliquely oriented lines. The effect was also present with these stimuli rotated, a manipulation which served to remove any residual resemblance the abstract images had to a face. The results suggest that low-level features underlie the search advantage for angry, schematic faces, thereby undermining a key source of evidence of a search advantage for specific facial expressions.
