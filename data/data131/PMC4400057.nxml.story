Experiments monitoring individual cells show that cells can behave differently even under same experimental conditions. Summarizing measurements over a population of cells can lead to weak and widely deviating signals, and subsequently applied modeling approaches, like network inference, will suffer from this information loss. Nested effects models, a method tailored to reconstruct signaling networks from high-dimensional read-outs of gene silencing experiments, have so far been only applied on the cell population level. These models assume the pathway under consideration to be activated in all cells. The signal flow is only disrupted, when genes are silenced. However, if this assumption is not met, inference results can be incorrect, because observed effects are interpreted wrongly. We extended nested effects models, to use the power of single-cell resolution data sets. We introduce a new unobserved factor, which describes the pathway activity of single cells. The pathway activity is learned for each cell during network inference. We apply our model to gene silencing screens, investigating human rhino virus infection of single cells from microscopy imaging features. Comparing the learned network to the known KEGG pathway of the genes shows that our method recovers networks significantly better than classical nested effects models without capturing of hidden signaling.
