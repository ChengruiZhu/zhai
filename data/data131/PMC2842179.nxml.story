Robust technique and accurate data analysis are required for reliable computed tomography perfusion (CTp) imaging. Multislice CT is required for high temporal resolution scanning; 16-slice (or 64-slice) scanners are preferred for adequate volume coverage. After tumour localization, the volume of CTp imaging has to be positioned to include the maximum visible area of the tumour and an adequate arterial vessel. Dynamic scans at high temporal resolution (at least 1-s gantry rotation time) are performed to visualize the first pass of contrast agent within the tumour; repeated scans with low temporal resolution can be planned for late enhancement assessment. A short bolus of conventional iodinated contrast agent, preferably with high iodine concentration, is power injected at a high flow rate (>4 ml/s) in the antecubital vein. The breath-hold technique is required for CTp imaging of the chest and upper abdomen to avoid respiratory motion; free breathing is adequate for CTp imaging of the head, neck and pelvis. Using dedicated software, a region of interest (ROI) has to be placed in an adequate artery (as arterial input) to obtain density–time curves; according to different kinetic models, colour maps of different CTp parameters are generated and generally overlaid on CT images. Additional ROIs can be positioned in the tumour, and in all other parts of the CTp volume, to obtain the values of the CTp parameters within the ROI.
