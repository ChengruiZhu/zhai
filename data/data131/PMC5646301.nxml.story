Low transverse sacral fractures are rare, with only two published reports regarding their surgery. The complication associated with surgery for sacral fractures is the prominence of implants. In addition, screw fixation below S3 is impractical. We performed posterior sacral fixation using S2 alar iliac (S2AI) screws and sacral sublaminar wires for low transverse sacral fractures. Case 1 was 65-year-old male with an S2-3 transverse sacral fracture. We performed laminectomy (S2-3) and passed ultrahigh molecular weight polyethylene (UHMWPE) cables from laminectomy area to the third posterior sacral foramina. We inserted S2AI screws and connected rods. We also tightened the UHMWPE cables. The implants did not protrude into skin. One year after surgery, the sacral fracture healed without any displacement. Case 2 was a 42-year-old female with an S2 transverse sacral fracture. We performed laminectomy (S1â€“3) and passed UHMWPE cables from laminectomy area to the third and fourth posterior sacral foramina. We inserted S1 pedicular screws and S2AI screws and connected rods. We also tightened UHMWPE cables. The implants did not protrude into skin. One year after surgery, the sacral fracture healed without any displacement. We consider sacral sublaminar wires to be useful bone anchors in lower sacrum.
