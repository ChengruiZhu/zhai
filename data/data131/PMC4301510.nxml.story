Thrombocytosis is commonly observed in patients exhibiting a variety of malignancies, including pulmonary, gastrointestinal and hepatic cancer. In the present study, the correlation between distant metastasis and thrombocytosis was retrospectively reviewed in 308 cases of histopathologically confirmed pulmonary adenocarcinoma. The patients were classified as having thrombocytosis or not, based on their platelet counts upon diagnosis; thrombocytosis was documented in 82/308 patients (26.6%). A log-rank test indicated a statistically significant difference in survival between patients exhibiting thrombocytosis compared with patients not exhibiting thrombocytosis (P<0.001). In addition, the occurrence of distant metastasis and the survival period were correlated with the presence of thrombocytosis upon diagnosis. In descending order of frequency, metastases were documented at the following sites: Lymph nodes (218/308 patients; 70.8%), bone (138/308 patients; 44.8%), lung (93/308 patients; 30.2%), brain (67/308 patients; 21.8%), liver (46/308 patients; 4.9%), adrenal glands (11/308 patients; 3.6%) and kidneys (5/308 patients; 1.6%). Bone metastasis occurred significantly more frequently in patients exhibiting thrombocytosis (50/82 patients: 61.0%; P<0.05) compared with patients not exhibiting thrombocytosis (88/226 patients; 38.9%). Furthermore, according to univariate analysis, thrombocytosis, weight loss, an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status score of â‰¥2 points, anemia, increased erythrocyte sedimentation rate, and increased alkaline phosphatase (AKP) and carcinoembryonic protein (CEA) levels were risk factors for bone metastasis. According to multivariate analysis, thrombocytosis, weight loss, and increased AKP and CEA levels were correlated with bone metastasis. Therefore, patients exhibiting pulmonary adenocarcinoma and thrombocytosis have a higher risk of bone metastasis compared with patients not exhibiting thrombocytosis.
