These findings show that, among non-malnourished children with malaria, lower respiratory tract infection, or diarrhea living in Kaabong, Uganda, provision of an RUTF-based nutritional supplement for 14 d following an illness as part of routine primary medical care prevented malnutrition. Because this trial only enrolled children who were non-malnourished, these findings cannot be generalized to all ill children with an infectious illness in Kaabong or similar settingsâ€”many ill children presenting at outpatient clinics are acutely malnourished. Interestingly, a companion trial undertaken by MSF in Goronyo, Nigeria found no reduction in the incidence of malnutrition among non-malnourished and moderately acutely malnourished children following short-term supplementation with either RUTF or MNP. The researchers suggest that the different results in the two trials may reflect the higher incidence of malnutrition and illness in Goronyo compared to Kaabong. Indeed, given the low incidence of malnutrition in Kaabong, the researchers suggest that a more targeted intervention such as only providing RUTF to ill children younger than 3 y old might be more cost-effective than providing nutritional supplementation to all ill children in Kaabong and similar settings.
