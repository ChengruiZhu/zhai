 A previous report that the offspring of outbred Sprague-Dawley rats, born of mothers presensitized or tolerant with respect to tissue antigens of the Lewis strain, and reinoculated with Lewis cells during their pregnancy, reject test grafts of Lewis skin in an accelerated manner has been confirmed. This "maternally induced" alteration in reactivity of the progeny has been found to be long lasting, immunologically specific, and probably not due to transfer of humoral antibody. It has been established that the reexposure of the mothers to donor cellular antigen during pregnancy augmented the influence of the prior states of tolerance or sensitivity. To obviate the complications inherent in working with the outbred Sprague-Dawley rats, the key experiments summarized above were repeated with isogenic Fischer rats as parents and Lewis rats as the tissue donors as before. With this combination it was found that a state of prior sensitization or tolerance in the mothers resulted in the apparent induction of tolerance in some of their progeny. Reinoculation of either the tolerant or sensitized mothers during pregnancy slightly increased the incidence and degree of impairment of their offsprings' capacity to reject Lewis skin grafts.
