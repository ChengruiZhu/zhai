The aim of the current study was to investigate the potential role of microRNA-183-5p (miR-183-5p) in the proliferation, invasion and metastasis of pancreatic cancer, and to identify promising target genes of oncogenic miR-183-5p. Western blotting and quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) were used to investigate whether these oncogenic microRNAs may be useful as biomarkers in pancreatic carcinoma (PaCa). Potential target genes were verified using miRDB, PicTar and TargetSCAN, and qPCR was used to detect the expression of miR-183 and suppressor of cytokine signaling 6 (SOCS-6; a potential target of miR-183) in PANC-1 PaCa cells and in the HPDE6-C7 pancreatic ductal cell line for comparison. The function of miR-183 in cell proliferation, wound healing, invasion and migration was also investigated using a miR-183 inhibitor. Western blot analysis was used to confirm SOCS-6 as a tumor suppressor and qPCR was used to detect and confirm that this potential target gene is directly regulated by miR-183. The results indicated that the expression of miR-183 in PANC-1 cells was upregulated compared with that in HPDE6-C7 cells, whilst the expression of SOCS-6 was downregulated. SOCS-6 expression was also significantly lower in PaCa tissues compared with that in matched normal pancreatic tissues from PaCa patients. Furthermore, expression of miR-183 was inversely correlated with that of SOCS-6. miR-183 knockdown decreased cell growth and motility in pancreatic cancer cells and significantly increased the expression of SOCS-6. These data suggest that oncogenic miR-183 may be useful as a pancreatic cancer biomarker. In addition, inhibition of miR-183 expression may be beneficial as PaCa treatment. SOCS-6 is a potential target gene of miR-183.
