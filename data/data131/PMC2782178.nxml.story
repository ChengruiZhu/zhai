Critical cell decisions, including whether to live, proliferate, or assemble into tissue structures, are directed by cues from the extracellular matrix, the external protein scaffold that surrounds cells. Integrin receptors on the cell surface bind to the extracellular matrix and cluster into complexes that translate matrix cues into the set of instructions a cell follows. Using a newly developed model of the cell-matrix interface, in this work we detail a simple yet efficient mechanism by which integrins could “sense” important matrix properties, including chemical composition and mechanical stiffness, and cluster appropriately. This mechanism relies on mechanical resistance to integrin-matrix interaction provided by the glycocalyx, the slimy sugar and protein coating on the cell, as well as the stiffness of the matrix and the cell itself. In general, the resistance alters integrin-ligand reaction rates, such that integrin clustering is favored for many physiologically relevant conditions. Interestingly, the mechanical properties of the cell and ECM are altered in many prevalent diseases, such as cancer, and our work suggests how these mechanical perturbations might adversely influence integrin function.
