The purpose of this study is to communicate findings from a case study on a South African mother with three children diagnosed with full mutation fragile X syndrome (FXS). The participant is an unaffected carrier of FXS. Research has shown that mothers of children with FXS often experience high levels of parenting stress and low levels of psychological well-being. However, observations made have piqued curiosity about their positivity and determination to carry on each day raising children diagnosed with FXS. The aim is to develop a better understanding of the manner in which a mother of children with FXS make sense of her situation, to gain further insight into the specific resilience processes she acquired. A qualitative case study approach was followed, gathering data through semi-structured interviews based on open-ended questions. The findings offer new insights into a South African mother's life raising children with FXS. Even though there is very limited support and little awareness of FXS in South Africa, she still found ways to seek help, and find solutions to every day challenges. The study conclusions discourage blind stereotyping of mothers of children with FXS as vulnerable only. Future research should concentrate on promoting awareness, education, advocacy, and support for individuals with FXS in South Africa.
