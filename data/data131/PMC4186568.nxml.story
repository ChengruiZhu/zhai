Use of cisplatin as a chemotherapeutic agent causes acute and delayed emesis. Kaolin, saccharin solution and normal feed consumption have been evaluated as an index of cisplatin-induced emesis in rats; however, the most preferable of these methods for evaluating the various phases of emesis remains unclear. In the current study, kaolin, saccharin solution and normal feed consumption following cisplatin administration (6 mg/kg intraperitoneally) were simultaneously investigated in rats. Kaolin consumption increased significantly following cisplatin administration and was attenuated by granisetron administration 0–24 h following the injection. Saccharin solution consumption, however, decreased significantly 0–48 h following cisplatin administration, however, was attenuated by administration of granisetron within 0–24 h only. A reduced intake of normal feed was observed in the control group and was reversed by granisetron within the 0–72 h period. The present study indicates that kaolin consumption may be evaluated as an index of cisplatin-induced acute emesis and saccharin solution consumption may be evaluated as an index of delayed emesis, while normal feed consumption as an indicator of anorexia nervosa may be suitable to evaluate all phases of emesis and serve as an indicator of quality of life.
