Liriodenine has wide pharmacological functions in phytochemistry, pharmacology and antitumor activities. The anticancer effects of liriodenine on the cell growth and apoptosis of human breast cancer MCF-7 cells, and the underlying mechanisms, are yet to be elucidated. Therefore, the present study investigated the anticancer effects of liriodenine on the cell growth and apoptosis of human breast cancer MCF-7 cells. We used MTT assay to measure cell growth, and flow cytometer and DAPI staining was used to analyze cell apoptosis. Then, Western blot analysis was executed to measure B-cell lymphoma-2 protein (Bcl-2), cyclin D1, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), and p53 protein expression. The effect of liriodenine induced significant apoptosis and suppression of cell growth of the MCF-7 cells. Furthermore, the potential mechanism underlying its antitumor effect on MCF-7 cells may result from activation of caspase-3 activity, Bcl-2, cyclin D1 and VEGF, and promotion of p53 protein expression in MCF-7 cells. Therefore, the present results indicated that the anticancer effects of liriodenine suppress cell growth and induce the apoptosis of human breast cancer MCF-7 cells through inhibition of Bcl-2, cyclin D1 and VEGF expression, and upregulation of p53 expression. Therefore, liriodenine may be a potential therapy for the treatment of human breast cancer.
