This article aims to document the growth in extracellular vesicle (EV) research. Here, we report the growth in EV-related studies, patents, and grants as well as emerging companies with major intent on exosomes. Four different databases were utilized for electronic searches of published literature: two general databases – Scopus/Elsevier and Web of Science (WoS), as well as two specialized US government databases – the USA Patent and Trademark Office and National Institutes of Health (NIH) of the Department of Health and Human Services. The applied combination of key words was carefully chosen to cover the most commonly used terms in titles of publications, patents and grants dealing with conceptual areas of EVs. Within the time frame from 1 January 2000 to 31 December 2016, limited to articles published in English, we identified output using search strategies based upon Scopus/Elsevier and WoS, patent filings and NIH Federal Reports of funded grants. Consistently, USA and UK universities are the most frequent among the top 15 affiliations/organizations of the authors of the identified records. There is clear evidence of upward streaming of EV-related publications. By documenting the growth of the EV field, we hope to encourage a roster of independent authorities skilled to provide peer review of manuscripts, evaluation of grant applications, support of foundation initiatives and corporate long-term planning. It is important to encourage EV research to further identify biomarkers in diseases and allow for the development of adequate diagnostic tools that could distinguish disease subpopulations and enable personalized treatment of patients.
