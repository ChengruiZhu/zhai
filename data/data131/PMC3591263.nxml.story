Obesity has become a perilous global epidemic that can lead to complex diseases, such as diabetes and cardiovascular diseases. Much effort has been devoted to the studies of the genetic mechanisms that pillow the manifestation of obesity. Although a large quantity of experimental data has been accumulated lately using high-throughput techniques, our understanding of genetic mechanisms of obesity is still limited. The proposed method is motivated to address three critical issues that have impeded the existing methods. The first is the curse of dimensionality in selecting a subset of genetic elements related to the traits of interest from a large number of candidates. The second is genetic multiplicity underlying non-Mendelian traits, in which multiple genes are in interplay. The third issue is the integration of data from multiple sources in light of genetic multiplicity and curse of dimensionality. Here, we propose a new method, which augments the Random Forests method with a network-based analysis, to integrate genotypic and gene expression information and identify correlated multiple genetic elements underlying mouse weight. Our results shed light on complex genetic interactions underlying obesity, which can form viable hypotheses worthy of further investigation.
