Aquaporin 4 (AQP4) is the major water channel expressed in the central nervous system and is primarily expressed in astrocytes. Recently, accumulated evidence has pointed to AQP4 as a key molecule that could play a critical role in glioma development. Discoveries of the role of AQP4 in cell migration suggest that AQP4 could be a significant factor regarding glioma malignancies. However, the AQP4 expression levels in glioma have not been fully elucidated; furthermore, the correlation of AQP4 expression with glioma malignancy remains controversial. Here, we review the expression pattern and predictive significance of AQP4 in malignant glioma. The molecular mechanism of AQP4 as it pertains to the migration and invasion of human glioma cells has been summarized. In addition, the important roles of AQP4 in combating drug resistance as well as potential pharmacological blockers of AQP4 have been systematically discussed. More research should be conducted to elucidate the potential roles of AQP4 in malignant glioma for identifying the tumor type, progression stages and optimal treatment strategies. The observed experimental results strongly emphasize the importance of this topic for future investigations.
