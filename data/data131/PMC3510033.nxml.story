The most fundamental mechanism of natural selection in a changing environment is the modulation of fitness by mutations. It is the tradeoffs offered by these mutations that drive evolution. However, fitness tradeoffs are rarely understood at the molecular level, in terms of how the selected mutations affect protein structure and function. Here, we merge experimental evolution and structural biology to study the fundamental tradeoff between survival and reproduction. We challenged populations of an RNA virus to evolve in a novel temperature environment where heat shock imposed extreme virus mortality. A single mutation in a specific viral protein increased the stability, and hence survival of challenged viruses, despite a concomitant tradeoff that decreased viral reproduction. This mutation increased the thermal stability of the mutant protein. Atomic structures of the wild-type and mutant protein reveal the molecular basis of this stabilization. The mutation did not reduce the enzymatic activity of the protein, suggesting that the reproduction tradeoff stems from other factors, such as inefficient virus assembly or disassembly. Our study uncovers the mechanism that drives the antagonistic effects of an individual point mutation in the classic evolutionary tug-of-war between survival and reproduction.
