Recent studies have investigated how the brain generates purposeful feedback responses to perturbations during motor control. One hypothesis suggests that the brain exploits the spring-like properties of muscles to counter perturbations. However, muscles exhibit high mechanical impedance only against small perturbations during posture, which questions the general contribution of intrinsic muscle impedance for feedback control. Alternatively, the brain may directly map sensory data into motor commands without compensating for sensorimotor delays, which is known to limit control performance. A third hypothesis suggests that neural activity following an external disturbance estimates the current state of the limb to generate a motor response. We used a perturbation paradigm where healthy participants were instructed to respond to perturbations within an extremely short time window. Comparing participants' performances with a model considering intrinsic joint impedance and conduction delays revealed that the case of state estimation was the best candidate control model to explain very fast corrective response of humans. This study emphasizes that model-based control can generate human-like rapid and stable feedback responses given low muscle stiffness and sensorimotor delays.
