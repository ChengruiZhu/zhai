The physiological responses of a cell to its environment are controlled by gene–protein interaction networks of great complexity. To understand how information is processed in these networks requires accurate mathematical models of the dynamical behavior of large sets of coupled chemical reactions. To avoid producing large and hardly manageable models, such reaction networks are often simplified using phenomenological reaction rate laws, such as the Michaelis–Menten rate law for an enzyme-catalyzed reaction. We show that, in regulatory networks where proteins swap places as enzymes and substrates, such simplifications must be carried out with care, keeping track of enzyme–substrate complexes. The risk is to provide a simplified description of the molecular networks that at best is correct for the long-term behavior but fails to represent the short-term dynamics of the real network. To avoid such a possibility, we suggest using an alternative approach called the total quasi-steady state approximation. We apply this alternative formalism to a model of the network controlling the entry into mitosis in the eukaryotic cell cycle, composed of three coupled protein modification cycles. Whereas the classical Michaelis–Menten formalism fails to represent the dynamics of this network correctly, the one we propose captures the behavior with economy and accuracy.
