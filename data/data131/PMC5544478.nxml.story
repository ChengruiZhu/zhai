Sodium glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors are a new class of antidiabetic drugs that improve glycemic control by inhibiting reabsorption of glucose filtered through the renal glomerulus. Use of drugs in this class has increased because of their effect of decreasing body weight and a low risk for hypoglycemia, in addition to a relatively strong glucose-lowering effect. SGLT2 inhibitors such as canagliflozin and sotagliflozin (a SGLT1/SGLT2 dual inhibitor) also have a mild or moderate intestinal and renal SGLT1 inhibitory effect because of their relatively weak selectivity for SGLT2 over SGLT1. Recent evidence shows that these SGLT2 inhibitors with low SGLT2/SGLT1 selectivity elevate the level of circulating glucagon like peptide-1 (GLP-1), an incretin hormone that promotes insulin secretion in pancreatic Î² cells. This effect probably occurs partly via inhibition of intestinal SGLT1, and the elevation of active GLP-1 levels is especially apparent when these drugs are co-administered with dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4) inhibitors. These findings suggest that a combination of canagliflozin or sotagliflozin and a DPP4 inhibitor can provide a beneficial effect associated with elevation of circulating active GLP-1 and may serve as a treatment for patients with type 2 diabetes.
