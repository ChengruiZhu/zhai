The genomes of vertebrate animals are naturally and extensively modified by methylation. The DNA methylation is essential to normal functions of cells, hence the whole animal, since it governs gene expression. Defects in the establishment and maintenance of proper methylation pattern are commonly associated with various developmental abnormalities and diseases. How exactly is the normal pattern defined in vertebrate animals is not fully understood, but recent researches with computational analyses and cultured cells suggested that DNA sequence is a primary determinant of the methylation pattern. This study encompasses the first experiments that rigorously test this notion in whole animal (medaka fish). In statistical sense, we observed the very strong correlation between DNA sequence and methylation state. However, by introducing unmethylated and artificially methylated native genomic DNA sequences into the genome, we demonstrated that the artificially conferred methylation states were robustly maintained in the animal, independent of the sequence and native state. Our results thus demonstrate that genome-wide DNA methylation pattern is not autonomously determined by the DNA sequence, which underpins the vital role of DNA methylation pattern as a core epigenetic element.
