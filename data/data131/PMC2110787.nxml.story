Rabbit antisera were prepared against the two major groups of microtubule-associated proteins (MAPs) from HeLa cells, proteins of approximately 210,000 molecular weight (210k MAPs), and 125,000 mol wt (125k MAPs). These antisera were characterized by a sensitive antigen detection technique that employs immunofluorescence to localize cross- reactive material in polyacrylamide gels. Antisera prepared against the 210k MAPs showed no cross-reactivity with extract proteins of other molecular weights or with bran MAPs, but did react with proteins of 210,000 mol wt and with a minor HeLa MAP of approximately 255,000 mol wt. Antibodies prepared against the 125k HeLa MAPs, likewise, reacted specifically with proteins of 125,000 mol wt, showing no cross- reactivity with other HeLa extract proteins or porcine brain MAPs. Immunofluorescence with the 210k and 125k MAP antisera was used to demonstrate the association of each of the MAPs with fixed HeLa microtubules in vitro. In addition, immunofluorescence with these antisera revealed a physical association of 210k and 125k MAPs with a Colcemid-sensitive fiber network in fixed interphase and mitotic HeLa cells. Thus, using specific, well-characterized antisera to the two major groups of HeLa MAPs, we have shown that these proteins are components of microtubules in HeLa cells.
