The platelet plays a pivotal role in maintaining vascular integrity. In a manner similar to leukocytes, platelets interact with selectins expressed on activated endothelium. P-selectin glycoprotein ligand 1 (PSGL-1) is the main P-selectin ligand expressed on leukocytes. Searching for platelet ligand(s), we used a P-selectin–immunoglobulin G (IgG) chimera to affinity purify surface-biotinylated proteins from platelet lysates. P-selectin–bound ligands were eluted with ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid. An ∼210-kD biotinylated protein was isolated from both human neutrophil and platelet preparations. A band of the same size was also immunopurified from human platelets using a monoclonal anti–human PSGL-1 antibody and could be blotted with P-selectin–IgG. Under reducing conditions, both the predicted PSGL-1 ∼210-kD dimer and the ∼120-kD monomer were isolated from platelets. Comparative immunoelectron microscopy and Western blotting experiments suggested that platelet PSGL-1 expression is 25–100-fold lower than that of leukocytes. However, patients with chronic idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura who harbor predominantly young platelets displayed greater expression, indicating that PSGL-1 expression may be decreased during platelet aging. By flow cytometry, thrombin-activated platelets from normal individuals exhibited greater expression than those unstimulated. An inhibitory anti–PSGL-1 antibody significantly reduced platelet rolling in mesenteric venules, as observed by intravital microscopy. Our results indicate that functional PSGL-1 is expressed on platelets, and suggest an additional mechanism by which selectins and their ligands participate in inflammatory and/or hemostatic responses.
