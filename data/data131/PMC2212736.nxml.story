Thrombopoietin (Tpo) is the primary cytokine regulating megakaryocyte development and platelet production. Tpo signaling through its receptor, c-mpl, activates multiple pathways including signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT)3, STAT5, phosphoinositide 3-kinase–Akt, and p42/44 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK). The adaptor protein Lnk is implicated in cytokine receptor and immunoreceptor signaling. Here, we show that Lnk overexpression negatively regulates Tpo-mediated cell proliferation and endomitosis in hematopoietic cell lines and primary hematopoietic cells. Lnk attenuates Tpo-induced S-phase progression in 32D cells expressing mpl, and Lnk decreases Tpo-dependent megakaryocyte growth in bone marrow (BM)–derived megakaryocyte culture. Consistent with this result, we found that in both BM and spleen, Lnk-deficient mice exhibited increased numbers of megakaryocytes with increased ploidy compared with wild-type mice. In addition, Lnk-deficient megakaryocytes derived from BM and spleen showed enhanced sensitivity to Tpo during culture. The absence of Lnk caused enhanced and prolonged Tpo induction of STAT3, STAT5, Akt, and MAPK signaling pathways in CD41
