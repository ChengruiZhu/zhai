The 2016 health education index showed such tendency as well including their raised obesity index, and reported that they are much interested in body images appearing externally. Accordingly, in this study, we conducted the self-reported questionnaire aimed at a total of 389 subjects composed of domestic (n= 226) and overseas (n= 163) female college students from Asia, Europe, and Latin America so as to investigate their body images for face, figure and health through questionnaires. In this context, a survey was conducted with the method of this study, consequently indicating that overseas subjects are more greatly positive and active to body images (face, figure, and health) by health level, exercise preferences, extent of body activities and body weight than domestic ones. These results reflect a different viewpoint between those subjects and reveal that overseas subjects are more committed to maintaining their health through body activities compared to domestic ones. Moreover, it is considered that domestic subjects tend to place a higher value on external beauty rather than beauty in terms of physical health, thereby it is most important to change the beauty values. Therefore, in the future, health education should play a critical role in promoting discussions for plans and practical strategies of improving health between students and in participating actively in health behaviours.
