Despite great advances in genotyping technologies, the ability to predict complex traits and diseases remains limited. Increasing evidence suggests that many of these traits may be affected by a large number of small-effect genes that are difficult to detect in single-variant association studies. Whole-Genome Regression (WGR) methods can be used to confront this challenge and have exhibited good predictive power when applied to animal and plant breeding populations. WGR is receiving increased attention in the field of human genetics. However, human and breeding populations differ greatly in factors that can affect the performance of WGRs. Using theory, simulation and real data analysis, we study the predictive performance of the Genomic Best Linear Unbiased Predictor (G-BLUP), one of the most commonly used WGR methods. We derive upper bounds for the prediction accuracy of G-BLUP under perfect and imperfect LD between markers and genotypes at causal loci and validate such upper bounds using simulation and real data analysis. Imperfect LD between markers and causal loci can impose a very low upper bound on the prediction accuracy of G-BLUP, especially when data involve unrelated individuals. In this context, we propose and evaluate avenues for improving the predictive performance of G-BLUP.
