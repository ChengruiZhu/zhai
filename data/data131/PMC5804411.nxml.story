In medical ultrasound transducers, the transmission mode (pass-through) approach has been used to estimate the characteristics of the acoustic lens. However, it is difficult to measure the acoustic lens properties with high precision because of human, systemic, or mechanical measurement errors. In this paper, we propose a low-cost estimation instrument for acoustic lens properties connected with a customized database. In the instrument, three-axis and one-axis transmitting and material fixtures accurately align the transmitting and receiving transducers separately. Through the developed instrument, we obtained a precise standard deviation of the attenuation coefficient and velocity of the acoustic lens material of 0.05 dB/cm and 2.62 m/s, respectively. Additionally, the simultaneous alignment between the fixtures is controllable with developed programs, thus generating very accurate information of the acoustic lens about the testing ultrasound transducer. In our instrument, the database could support users in managing the result data efficiently. User programs developed using LabVIEW provide the capability to obtain precise values of the attenuation coefficient and velocity, which represent the fundamental material characteristics of the acoustic lens of the medical ultrasound transducers. The developed review program of the customized database can also search the acoustic lens information and store the experimental results.
