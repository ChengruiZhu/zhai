Translocations involve exchange of material between two or more chromosomes and are a common form of genetic abnormality. The rearrangements are difficult to process during meiosis, frequently producing gametes with missing/extra pieces of the affected chromosomes. It has been suggested that translocations might also disrupt the segregation of structurally normal chromosomes, a so-called interchromosomal effect (ICE), but the published data is contradictory. Here we report results from a unique collection of samples, consisting of oocytes and embryos from translocation carriers. Examination of more than 210,000 chromosomes revealed no evidence of an ICE in oocytes, but a significant effect in embryos tested three days after fertilization (6â€“10 cell stage) in a subset of patients. Clinically, this means that some translocation carriers are at even higher risk of chromosomally abnormal pregnancies than previously suspected, a factor that should be considered during genetic counselling. Scientifically, the results illuminate a poorly understood stage of human development, characterized by chromosomal instability, reminiscent of that observed in some tumors. The restriction of the ICE to a narrow developmental window was unexpected, yet may explain why some earlier studies could not agree on the existence of an ICE.
