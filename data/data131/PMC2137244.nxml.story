 Using three different methods of cells fractionation, hemosiderin granules were isolated from tissues (liver and/or spleen) of three patients. The samples were obtained from a case of idiopathic hemochromatosis, a case of thalassemia major with secondary (transfusional?) hemosiderosis, and a case of transfusional hemosiderosis associated with an unclassified anemia. Iron, nitrogen, and protein content of the hemosiderin granules varied over a wide range. Electron microscopy of sectioned granules revealed aggregates of dense particles of different shapes, with diameters ranging from 10 A to about 75 A. In some of the granules dense particles corresponding to the iron hydroxide micelles of ferritin molecules were abundant. But many of the granules contained very few of these molecules. The presence of ferritin and apoferritin in the samples of hemosiderin granules was demonstrated by means of precipitin tests in agar-gel, using rabbit antiferritin sera with known antibody nitrogen concentrations. At least three antigenic components were detected in highly purified crystalline ferritin prepared from tissues of the three patients; the hemosiderin granules contained the same antigens, but probably in much smaller quantities. Both ferritin and apoferritin molecules were extracted from hemosiderin granules, and were demonstrated in the electron microscope after suitable preparation.
