The arterial roots are important transitional regions of the heart, connecting the intrapericardial components of the aortic and pulmonary trunks with their ventricular outlets. They house the arterial (semilunar) valves and, in the case of the aorta, are the points of coronary arterial attachment. Moreover, because of the semilunar attachments of the valve leaflets, the arterial roots span the anatomic ventriculo‚Äêarterial junction. By virtue of this arrangement, the interleaflet triangles, despite being fibrous, are found on the ventricular aspect of the root and located within the left ventricular cavity. Malformations and diseases of the aortic root are common and serious. Despite the mouse being the animal model of choice for studying cardiac development, few studies have examined the structure of their arterial roots. As a consequence, our understanding of their formation and maturation is incomplete. We set out to clarify the anatomical and histological features of the mouse arterial roots, particularly focusing on their walls and the points of attachment of the valve leaflets. We then sought to determine the embryonic lineage relationships between these tissues, as a forerunner to understanding how they form and mature over time. Using histological stains and immunohistochemistry, we show that the walls of the mouse arterial roots show a gradual transition, with smooth muscle cells (
