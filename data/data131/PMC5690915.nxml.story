The purpose of this study is to evaluate patient setup accuracy and quantify individual and cumulative positioning uncertainties associated with different hardware and software components of the stereotactic radiotherapy (SRS/SRT) with the frameless 6D ExacTrac system. A statistical model is used to evaluate positioning uncertainties of the different components of SRS/SRT treatment with the Brainlab 6D ExacTrac system using the positioning shifts of 35 patients having cranial lesions. All these patients are immobilized with rigid head‐and‐neck masks, simulated with Brainlab localizer and planned with iPlan treatment planning system. Stereoscopic X‐ray images (XC) are acquired and registered to corresponding digitally reconstructed radiographs using bony‐anatomy matching to calculate 6D translational and rotational shifts. When the shifts are within tolerance (0.7 mm and 1°), treatment is initiated. Otherwise corrections are applied and additional X‐rays (XV) are acquired to verify that patient position is within tolerance. The uncertainties from the mask, localizer, IR ‐frame, X‐ray imaging, MV, and kV isocentricity are quantified individually. Mask uncertainty (translational: lateral, longitudinal, vertical; rotational: pitch, roll, yaw) is the largest and varies with patients in the range
