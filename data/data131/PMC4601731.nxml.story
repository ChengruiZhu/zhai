Understanding how inhibitory neurons interact with excitatory neurons is critical for understanding the behaviors of neuronal networks. Here we address this question with simple but biologically relevant models based on the anatomy of the locust olfactory pathway. Two ubiquitous and basic inhibitory motifs were tested: feed-forward and feedback. Feed-forward inhibition typically occurs between different brain areas when excitatory neurons excite inhibitory cells, which then inhibit a group of postsynaptic excitatory neurons outside of the initializing excitatory neurons’ area. On the other hand, the feedback inhibitory motif requires a population of excitatory neurons to drive the inhibitory cells, which in turn inhibit the same population of excitatory cells. We found the type of the inhibitory motif determined the timing with which each group of cells fired action potentials in comparison to one another (relative timing). It also affected the range of inhibitory neurons’ activity, with the inhibitory neurons having a wider range in the feedback circuit than that in the feed-forward one. These results will allow predicting the type of the connectivity structure within unexplored biological circuits given only electrophysiological recordings.
