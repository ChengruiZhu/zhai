Using the methods described in the preceding paper (Levine et al., 1984) for measuring the magnitude of the water-permeable barriers in series with the luminal membrane, we correct measured values of Pd(w) in bladders stimulated with low doses of antidiuretic hormone (ADH) or 8-bromo cyclic AMP to obtain their true values in the luminal membrane. Simultaneously, we also determine Pf. We thus are able to calculate Pf/Pd(w) for the hormone-induced water permeation pathway in the luminal membrane. Our finding is that Pf/Pd(w) approximately equal to 17. Two channel models consistent both with this value and the impermeability of the ADH-induced water permeation pathway to small nonelectrolytes are: (a) a long (approximately equal to 50 A), small- radius (approximately equal to 2 A) pore through which 17 water molecules pass in single-file array, and (b) a shower-head-like structure in which the stem is long and of large radius (approximately equal to 20 A) and the cap has numerous short, small-radius (approximately equal to 2 A) pores. A third possibility is that whereas the selective permeability to H2O results from small-radius (approximately equal to 2 A) pores, the large value of Pf/Pd(w) arises from their location in the walls of long tubular vesicles (approximately 2 micron in length and 0.1 micron in diameter) that are functionally part of the luminal membrane after having fused with it. Aggregate-containing tubular vesicles of these dimensions have been reported to fuse with the luminal membrane in response to ADH stimulation and have been implicated in the ADH-induced hydroosmotic response.
