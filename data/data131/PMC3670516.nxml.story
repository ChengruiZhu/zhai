-adrenoceptor agonist used for sedation due to its anxiolytic and analgesic properties without respiratory compromise. Due to its structural similarity to etomidate, there has been concern that dexmedetomidine may cause adrenal insufficiency. This concern was initially supported by animal studies, but subsequent human studies demonstrated mixed results. We describe the case of transient adrenal insufficiency in a 1-year-old male who presented with 24% total body surface 2nd degree burns. He required sedation with a prolonged, high-dose dexmedetomidine infusion with a peak infusion dose of 2.7 mcg/kg/hr and duration of 6.5 days. The patient developed lethargy and hypotension four days after discontinuation of his infusion. He had a random cortisol level which was low at 0.4 mcg/dL, and the concern for adrenal suppression was confirmed with an ACTH stimulation test with the baseline cortisol of 0.4 mcg/dL and inappropriate 60 minute post-ACTH stimulation cortisol of 7.8 mcg/dL. While further studies will be needed to clarify the risk of adrenal suppression secondary to dexmedetomidine, this case suggests that caution should be taken when administering dexmedetomidine to pediatric patients and highlights the need for future studies to look at appropriate dosing and duration of dexmedetomidine infusions.
