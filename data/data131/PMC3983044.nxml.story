When our body's internal timekeeping system becomes misaligned with the time of day in the outside world, many negative effects can be felt, including decreased performance, improper sleep, and jet lag. When misalignment is prolonged, it can also lead to serious medical conditions, including cancer, cardiovascular disease, and possibly even late-onset diabetes. Rapid readjustment of our internal daily (circadian) clock by properly timed exposure to light, which is the strongest signal to our internal circadian clock, is therefore important to the large proportion of the population which suffers from misalignment, including transmeridian travelers, shift workers, and individuals with circadian disorders. Here we develop a methodology to determine schedules of light exposure which may shift the human circadian clock in the minimum time. By calculating thousands of schedules, we show how the human circadian pacemaker is predicted to be capable of shifting much more rapidly than previously thought, simply by adjusting the timing of the beginning and end of each day. Schedules are summarized into general principles of optimal shifting, which can be applied without knowledge of the schedules themselves.
