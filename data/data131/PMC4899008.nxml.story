Osteoarthritis (OA) is the most prevalent degenerative joint disease with multifactorial etiology caused by risk factors such as ageing, obesity and trauma. Previously, it was reported that the inhibition of microRNA-34a (miR-34a) may reduce rat chondrocyte apoptosis induced by IL-1Î², whereas the molecular mechanism and the role of miR-34a in human chondrocyte as well as in OA progression remains to be determined. In the current study, using MTT, luciferase reporter assays and western blot analysis we identified that miR-34a was upregulated while silent information regulator 1 (SIRT1) was inhibited in chondrocytes from 12 OA patients compared with healthy chondrocytes from 10 trauma amputees. Overexpression of miR-34a promoted apoptosis and inhibited cell proliferation in human chondrocytes. Transfection with miR-34a mimic inhibited SIRT1 expression, which attenuated the deacetylation of p53, leading to the upregulation of Bax and downregulation of Bcl-2. Furthermore, results from the western blot analysis and luciferase reporter assay demonstrated that SIRT1 was directly regulated by miR-34a in human chondrocytes. A rat model of OA was induced through anterior cruciate ligament transection and medial meniscus resection (ACLT+MMx). The results showed that the intra-articular injection of lentiviral vector encoding anti-miR-34a sequence effectively ameliorated the progression of OA. The results suggest that miR-34a has a crucial role in the pathogenesis of OA through direct regulation of the SIRT1/p53 signaling pathway and serves as a potential therapeutic target of OA.
