Neuromuscular systems often employ redundancy in joint actuation, with different combinations of muscle and tendon action producing the same net joint torque. Both the resolution of these redundancies and the energetics of such systems depend strongly on the force-length relations of muscles and tendons. Many human walking models fail to properly account for elasticity by failing to scale muscle-tendon parameters for different individuals, relying instead on stock values taken from cadaver studies. This can result in inaccurate estimates of metabolic consumption as well as of the forces and states of individual muscles. Instead we estimate muscle-tendon parameters using a data-driven optimization procedure, testing the hypothesis that the human leg has evolved to maximize the metabolic efficiency of walking at self-selected speed. We find that the experimentally observed metabolic consumption can be matched with reasonable joint torque fidelity through the addition of a single constraint on the per-muscle metabolic budget. The associated muscle-tendon parameter sets were used to compute muscle force and state estimates, lending insight into potential roles and control objectives of the major muscles of the leg throughout the gait cycle.
