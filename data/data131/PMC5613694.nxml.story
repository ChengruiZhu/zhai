We previously reported that aerobic exercise training (AET) consisted of 10 weeks of 60-min swimming sessions, and 5 days/week AET counteracts CH in obesity. Here, we evaluated the role of microRNAs and their target genes that are involved in heart collagen deposition and calcium signaling, as well as the cardiac remodeling induced by AET in obese Zucker rats. Among the four experimental Zucker groups: control lean rats (LZR), control obese rats (OZR), trained lean rats (LZR + TR), and trained obese rats (OZR + TR), heart weight was greater in the OZR than in the LZR group due to increased cardiac intramuscular fat and collagen. AET seems to exert a protective role in normalizing the heart weight in the OZR + TR group. Cardiac microRNA-29c expression was decreased in OZR compared with the LZR group, paralleled by an increase in the collagen volumetric fraction (CVF). MicroRNA-1 expression was upregulated while the expression of its target gene NCX1 was decreased in OZR compared with the LZR group. Interestingly, AET restored cardiac microRNA-1 to nonpathological levels in the OZR-TR group. Our findings suggest that AET could be used as a nonpharmacological therapy for the reversal of pathological cardiac remodeling and cardiac dysfunction in obesity.
