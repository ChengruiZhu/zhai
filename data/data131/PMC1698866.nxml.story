Early cardiogenesis including myofibrillogenesis is a critical event during development. ­Recently we showed that prospective cardiomyocytes reside in the posterior lateral blastoderm in the chick embryo. Here we cultured the posterior region of the chick blastoderm in serum-free medium and observed the process of myofibrillogenesis by immunohistochem­istry. After 48 hours, explants expressed sarcomeric proteins (sarcomeric α-actinin, 61%; smooth muscle α-actin, 95%; Z-line titin, 56%; sarcomeric myosin, 48%); however, they did not yet show a mature striation. After 72 hours, more than 92% of explants expressed I-Z-I proteins, which were incorporated into the striation in 75% of explants or more (sarcomeric α-actinin, 75%; smooth muscle α-actin, 81%; Z-line titin, 83%). Sarcomeric myosin was ­expressed in 63% of explants and incorporated into A-bands in 37%. The percentage incidence of expression or striation of I-Z-I proteins was significantly higher than that of sarcomeric myosin. Results suggested that the nascent I-Z-I components appeared to be gener­ated independently of A-bands in the cultured posterior blastoderm, and that the process of myofibrillogenesis observed in our culture model faithfully reflected that
