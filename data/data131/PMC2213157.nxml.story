The selectin family of adhesion molecules and their glycoconjugated ligands are essential for blood polymorphonuclear neutrophil (PMN) extravasation into inflammatory and infectious sites. However, E-selectin ligands on PMNs are not well characterized. We show here that CD44 immunopurified from G-CSF–differentiated 32D cells or from peripheral blood PMNs binds specifically to E-selectin. In contrast, CD44 extracted from bone marrow stromal or brain endothelial cell lines does not interact with E-selectin, suggesting cell-specific posttranslational modifications of CD44. PMN-derived CD44 binding activity is mediated by sialylated, α(1,3) fucosylated, N-linked glycans. CD44 enables slow leukocyte rolling on E-selectin expressed on inflamed endothelium in vivo and cooperates with P-selectin glycoprotein ligand–1 to recruit neutrophils into thioglycollate-induced peritonitis and staphylococcal enterotoxin A–injected skin pouch. CD44 extracted from human PMNs also binds to E-selectin. Moreover, we demonstrate that CD44 is hypofucosylated in PMNs from a patient with leukocyte adhesion deficiency type II, suggesting that it contributes to the syndrome. These findings thus suggest broader roles for CD44 in the innate immune response and uncover a potential new target for diseases in which selectins play a prominent role.
