The primary goal of surgical oncology is to obtain a tumour resection with disease-free margins. Transoral robotic surgery (TORS) for surgical treatment of head-neck cancer is commensurate with standard treatments. However, the likelihood of positive margins after TORS is up to 20.2% in a recent US survey. The aim of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and the feasibility of narrow-band imaging (NBI) during TORS in order to improve the ability to achieve disease-free margins during tumour excision. The present study was conducted at the ENT, Head- Neck Surgery and Oral Surgery Unit, Department of Special Surgery, Morgagni Pierantoni Hospital, Azienda USL Romagna. From March 2008 to January 2015, 333 TORS were carried out for malignant and benign diseases. For the present study, we retrospectively evaluated 58 biopsy-proven squamous cell carcinoma patients who underwent TORS procedures. Patients were divided into 2 groups: (1) 32 who underwent TORS and intra-operative NBI evaluation (NBI-TORS); (2) 21 who underwent TORS with standard intra-operative white-light imaging (WLITORS). Frozen section analysis of margins on surgical specimens showed a higher rate of negative superficial lateral margins in the NBI-TORS group compared with the WLI-TORS group (87.9%
