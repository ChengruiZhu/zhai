Gene expression is regulated at multiple levels, including the decision of whether or not to translate a mRNA. This phenomenon, known as translational regulation, allows rapid changes in cellular concentrations of proteins and is well suited to the adjustment of cellular growth in response to stress and environmental changes. Many bacterial mRNAs adopt structures in their 5â€² untranslated regions that modulate the accessibility of the mRNA to the small ribosomal 30S subunit and so are directly involved in this regulatory process. Structured mRNAs must interact with the 30S subunit in a two-step pathway whereby the docking of a folded mRNA is followed by an accommodation step that involves unfolding of these structures. However, it is not known how the ribosome unfolds mRNA structures to promote translation initiation, nor which ribosomal factors are responsible for this activity. We demonstrate that the first three domains of ribosomal protein S1 endow the 30S subunit with an RNA chaperone activity that is essential for the binding and unfolding of structured mRNAs, allowing the correct positioning of the initiation codon for translation. However, ribosomal protein S1 is not required for all mRNAs and acts differently depending on the type of regulatory elements present in a given mRNA. In all, we have shown that ribosomal protein S1 provides an RNA-melting activity to the exit site of the 30S decoding channel and confers some plasticity on the ribosome to initiate translation of mRNAs.
