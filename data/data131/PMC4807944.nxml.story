A new Soluplus (polyvinyl caprolactam–polyvinyl acetate–polyethylene glycol graft copolymer)-based supersaturable self-emulsifying drug delivery system (S-SEDDS) was formulated to enhance oral absorption of tacrolimus (FK506) with minimal use of oil, surfactant, and cosurfactant. A high payload supersaturable system (S-SEDDS) was prepared by incorporating Soluplus, as a precipitation inhibitor, to SEDDS consisting of Capmul MCM, Cremophor EL, and Transcutol (FK506:vehicle:Soluplus =1:15:1). In vitro dissolution profile and in vitro pharmacokinetic aspect of S-SEDDS in rats were comparatively evaluated with those of conventional SEDDS formulas containing four times greater content of vehicle components (FK506:vehicle =1:60). Both formulations formed spherical drug-loaded microemulsion <70 nm in size when in contact with aqueous medium. In an in vitro dissolution test in a nonsink condition, the amphiphilic polymer noticeably retarded drug precipitation and maintained >80% of accumulated dissolution rate for 24 hours, analogous to that from conventional SEDDS. Moreover, pharmacokinetic parameters of the maximum blood concentration and area under the curve from S-SEDDS formula in rats were not statistically different (
