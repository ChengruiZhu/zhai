Oxidative stress, and in particular oxidation of lipoproteins, is a hallmark of atherosclerosis. Upon entry of lipoproteins into the vessel wall, a cascade of pro-atherogenic pathways is initiated whereby the reaction of reactive oxygen species with substrates amenable to oxidation, such as polyunsaturated fatty acids, generates a variety of oxidation-specific epitopes on lipoproteins, proteins in the vessel wall, and apoptotic macrophages. Several of these oxidation-specific epitopes have been well characterized and specific murine and fully human antibodies have been generated in our laboratory to detect them in the vessel wall. We have developed radionuclide, gadolinium and iron oxide based MRI techniques to noninvasively image oxidation-specific epitopes in atherosclerotic lesions. These approaches quantitate plaque burden and also allow detection of atherosclerosis regression and plaque stabilization. In particular, gadolinium micelles or lipid-coated ultrasmall superparamagnetic iron oxide particles containing oxidation-specific antibodies accumulate within macrophages in the artery wall, suggesting they may image the most unstable plaques. Translation of these approaches to humans may allow a sensitive technique to image and monitor high-risk atherosclerotic lesions and may guide optimal therapeutic interventions.
