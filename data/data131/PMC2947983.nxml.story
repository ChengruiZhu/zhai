It is well established that neuronal morphology influences the computation performed by a single neuron. However, it remains largely unknown how these computations emerge from the interaction between dendritic morphology, the distribution of ion-channels and synaptic inputs. To investigate this neuronal morphology-function relationship we employ an inverse approach in which detailed model neurons are optimized to perform a predefined computation. In this work, we set to investigate how dendritic morphology contributes to wide-field motion integration in fly lobula plate tangential cells (LPTCs), cells of which the morphology is assumed to be linked to their function as wide-field motion integrators. The resulting optimized models perform well and share crucial features of LPTC morphology. By analysis of the optimized models, we revealed a match between morphological structures and physiological mechanisms required to perform wide-field motion integration, i.e., we explicitly show the morphology-function relationship in LPTC neurons. Moreover, the optimized distribution of ionic conductances gives rise to predictions about the distribution and role of these conductances in the real neurons. Finally, our findings provide an explanation of dendritic morphologies in terms of the computation they should perform.
