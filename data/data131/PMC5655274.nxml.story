The effect of smoking on the prognosis of young patients with acute myocardial infarction (AMI) is inconclusive. We enrolled 2188 young AMI patients (≤ 45 years) from the cardiac center of the Chinese PLA General Hospital and Anzhen Hospital and analyzed their clinical characteristics and prognosis. We also searched the PubMed, EMBASE, and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials electronic databases for January 2001 to March 2017 and considered for inclusion in a meta-analysis those clinical trials that compared prognoses of young smokers and non-smokers with AMI. The proportion of males and alcohol users was higher in young AMI smokers than in non-smokers; the proportion of hypertension was slightly lower. There was no difference in medical treatment between smokers and non-smokers. No differences were evident between smokers and non-smokers regarding in-hospital cardiac events and major adverse cardiovascular events on follow-up, including incidence of stroke. For young AMI patients, smoking did not lead to poorer prognosisin comparison with not smoking. This “smoker's paradox” needs to be confirmed by more randomized controlled multicenter prospective clinical trials.
