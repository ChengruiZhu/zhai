In this era of rising concerns about antibiotic resistance, the rational design of optimal antibiotic treatment regimens remains an important unrealized goal. At this time, the characteristics of antibiotic treatment regimens (e.g. dosing levels, treatment duration, route of administration) are determined largely based on costly in vivo experiments. The sheer number of possible dosing strategies that must be tested contributes to the delay and cost of the development of new drugs and may limit the feasibility of finding optimal regimen characteristics. Here, we demonstrate how modeling the chemical kinetics of drug-target binding can identify the best time-concentration profile of antibiotics. Using both analytical approaches and numerical simulations, we find that the physicochemical characteristics of drug-target binding are sufficient to explain the pharmacodynamics of commonly used antibiotics such as ampicillin, isoniazid and tetracycline. In practical terms, our models can be used as a tool in the rational design of treatment for bacterial infections. Because of the generality of drug-target binding kinetics, these approaches may also be adapted to other diseases where the effects of physiological fluctuations of drug concentration are also poorly understood, such as HIV, malaria and cancer.
