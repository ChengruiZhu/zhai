In the midst of increasingly available sequence data of pathogens, a key challenge is to better integrate these data with traditional epidemiological data, with the proximate goal of reliable prediction and the ultimate aim of effective management of disease outbreaks. Although substantial advances have been made for such an integration, and they have improved our understandings of many disease dynamics which are not available otherwise, current methods have relied on fast algorithms, rather than achieving a systematic integration and accurate inference of the joint epidemiological-evolutionary process. Building on methods in current literature, this paper describes a novel Bayesian approach for systematically integrating these two streams of data. We propose a computationally tractable Bayesian inferential algorithm which takes the full joint epidemiological-evolutionary process into account. Using this algorithm, we study systematically the value of genetic data, providing valuable insights into future sampling designs. The algorithm is subsequently applied to real-world dataset describing the spread of animal foot-and-mouth disease in the UK, demonstrating the importance of such a systematic integration achieved with our methodology.
