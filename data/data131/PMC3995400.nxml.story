We report the case of a 68-year-old woman with autoimmune hepatitis (AIH) who had leg ulcers induced by disseminated cryptococcosis. She had received prednisolone for her AIH at 20 mg/day for maintenance. On the initial visit, she complained of a painful ulcer that had round, shallow pockets with erythema and erythematous subcutaneous indurations on the right thigh. Several metacarpophalangeal joints and wrist joints were swollen, with tenderness and stiffness in the morning for over 3 h. Her serum rheumatoid factor was high. Since other autoimmune disorders such as rheumatoid arthritis can present with AIH, it was necessary to distinguish it from ulcers due to rheumatoid arthritis, although the characteristic features of these ulcers seemed to be different. A biopsy specimen from the erythematous skin showed globe-shaped organisms in the dermis and subcutaneous tissues; vasculitis and phlebostasis were not observed. The results from computed tomography scans and sputum culture led to the diagnosis of disseminated cryptococcosis. The administration of fluconazole, fosfluconazole, and voriconazole for about 2 months improved the cryptococcal pneumonia, but the size of the skin ulcer enlarged. The administration was changed to itraconazole, which reduced the size. Cryptococcal infections occur more commonly in immunocompromised hosts, including patients under immunosuppressive therapies such as corticosteroids. The possibility that the skin ulcers in immunocompromised hosts may be caused by cryptococcosis should be considered.
