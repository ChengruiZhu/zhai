Transient receptor potential, melastatin-2 (TRPM2) is a plasma membrane cation channel with important roles in sensory functions and promoting cell death. However, we demonstrated here that TRPM2 was present in the nuclei of MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 human breast adenocarcinoma cells, and its pharmacologic inhibition or RNAi silencing caused decreased cell proliferation. Neither an effect on proliferation nor a localization of TRPM2 in the nucleus was observed in noncancerous HMEC and MCF-10A human mammary epithelial cells. Investigation of possible effects of TRPM2 function in the nucleus demonstrated that pharmacologic inhibition or RNAi silencing of TRPM2 in MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 human breast adenocarcinoma cells caused up to 4-fold increases in DNA damage levels, as compared to noncancerous breast cells after equivalent treatments. These results indicate that TRPM2 has a novel nuclear function in human breast adenocarcinoma cells that facilitates the integrity of genomic DNA, a finding that is distinct from its previously reported role as a plasma membrane cation channel in noncancerous cells. In summary, we report here a novel effect promoted by TRPM2, where it functions to minimize DNA damage and thus may have a role in the protection of genomic DNA in breast cancer cells. Our study therefore provides compelling evidence that TRPM2 has a unique role in breast adenocarcinoma cells. Accordingly, these studies suggest that TRPM2 is a potential therapeutic target, where its pharmacologic inhibition may provide an innovative strategy to selectively increase DNA damage levels in breast cancer cells.
