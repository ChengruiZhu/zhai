Lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) is the most common histological subtype of non-small cell lung cancer, but novel biomarkers for early diagnosis are lacking. Extensive effort has been exerted to identify miRNA biomarkers in LUAD. Unfortunately, high inter-lab variability and small sample sizes have produced inconsistent conclusions in this field. To resolve the above-mentioned limitations, we performed a comprehensive analysis based on LUAD miRNome profiling studies using the robust rank aggregation (RRA) method. Moreover, miRNA-gene interaction network, pathway enrichment analysis and Kaplan-Meier survival curves were used to investigate the clinical values and biological functions of the identified miRNAs. A total of six common differentially expressed miRNAs (DEMs) were identified in LUAD. An independent cohort further confirmed that four miRNAs (miR-21-5p, miR-210-3p, miR-182-5p and miR-183-5p) were up-regulated and two miRNAs (miR-126-3p and miR-218-5p) were down-regulated in LUAD tissues. Pathway enrichment analysis also suggested that the above-listed six DEMs may affect LUAD progression via the estrogen signaling pathway. Survival analysis based on the TCGA dataset revealed the potential prognostic values of six DEMs in patients with LUAD (
