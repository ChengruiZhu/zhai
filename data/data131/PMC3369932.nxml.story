Recent evidence suggests that many cancers, including those of the breast, are maintained by a population of cancer cells that display stem cell properties. These “cancer stem cells” may also contribute to tumor metastasis, treatment resistance, and relapse. Recently, miRNAs (small non-coding RNAs) have been reported to be capable of functioning as oncogenes or tumor suppressors. miRNA93 (mir-93) is frequently overexpressed in human cancer but, paradoxically, has been found to function as a tumor suppressor in some contexts. Using a series of breast cancer cell lines representing different stages of differentiation and mouse xenograft models, we demonstrate that mir-93 modulates the fate of breast cancer stem cells by regulating their proliferation and differentiation states. In less differentiated tumors, enforced expression of mir-93 completely blocks tumor development in mammary fat pads and development of metastases following intracardiac injection in mouse xenografts by reducing breast cancer stem cells. However, the effect of mir-93 on the cancer stem cell population is dependent on the cellular differentiation state, with mir-93 expression increasing the cancer stem cell population in more differentiated breast tumors. These studies demonstrate that miRNAs can regulate breast stem cell proliferation and differentiation, an observation with important biological and clinical implications.
