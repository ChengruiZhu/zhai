All patients admitted to a medical ICU at a college affiliated with the Japan Society of Intensive Care Medicine between January 2008 and December 2014 were surveyed prospectively for the development of CRBSIs. A mandatory educational program (the intervention) targeting an infection control committee consisting of physicians was developed by a multidisciplinary task force to highlight correct practices for preventing CRBSIs. The program included a 30-min video-based introduction, 120-min lectures with a number of hands-on training sessions, a post-test, posters, safety check sheets, and feedback from the infection control committee. Lectures based on the education program were held every 3 months, and participants were free to choose when they attended the lectures. Each participant was required to view the 30-min introduction before attending the 120-min lectures and complete the post-test after each lecture. Safety check sheets were made to ascertain adherence to contents of the educational program. Posters describing the educational program were posted throughout the ICU. A pre- and post-intervention observational study design was employed, with the main outcome measure being yearly CRBSIs. We also calculated cost savings that resulted from improved CRBSI rates.
