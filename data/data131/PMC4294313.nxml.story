Human trophoblast invasion and differentiation are essential for successful pregnancy outcome. The molecular mechanisms, however, are poorly understood. Interleukin (IL)-11, a cytokine, regulates endometrial epithelial cell adhesion. Leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) is one of the key cytokines in the embryo implantation regulation. The present study aimed to assess the levels of LIF, IL-11, and IL-11 α receptor gene expression in the endometrium of women undergoing IVF and correlate their levels with the IVF pregnancy outcome. Also, the study aimed to detect any mutation in these three genes among IVF pregnant and non-pregnant women versus control menstrual blood of fertile women. Endometrial tissue biopsies were taken from 15 women undergoing IVF on the day of oocyte retrieval. The quantitative expression of IL-11, IL-11Rα, and LIF genes was assessed by real-time PCR and PCR products were sequenced. Menstrual blood from 10 fertile women was used as control to compare the DNA sequence versus DNA sequence of the studied genes in endometrial biopsies. LH, FSH, and E2 were assessed for enrolled patients by ELISA. Endometrial thickness was also assessed by pelvic ultrasonography. No significant difference was detected between quantitative expression of the three studied genes and pregnancy IVF outcome. Although DNA sequence changes were found in IL-11 and LIF genes of women with negative pregnancy IVF outcome compared to women with positive pregnancy IVF outcome, no DNA sequence changes were detected for IL-11Rα. Other studied parameters (e.g., age, LH, FSH, E2, and endometrial thickness) showed no significant differences or correlation of quantitative expression of the three studied involved genes. Data suggested that there were no significant differences between quantitative expression of IL-11, IL-11Rα, and LIF genes and the IVF pregnancy outcome. The present study may reveal that changes in IL-11 and LIF genes sequence may contribute in pregnancy IVF outcome.
