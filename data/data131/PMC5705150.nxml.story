Male infertility affects one in twenty men of reproductive age in western countries. Despite this, the biochemical basis of common defects, including reduced sperm count and abnormal sperm structure and function, remains poorly defined. Microtubules are cellular “scaffolds” that serve critical roles in all cells, including developing male germ cells wherein they facilitate mitosis and meiosis (cell division), sperm head remodelling and sperm tail formation. The precise regulation of microtubule number, length and movement is thus, essential for male fertility. Within this manuscript, we have used spermatogenesis to define the function of the putative microtubule-severing protein katanin-like 2 (KATNAL2). We show that mice with compromised KATNAL2 function are male sterile as a consequence of defects in the structural remodelling of germ cells. Notably, we show the function of microtubule-based structures involved in sperm head shaping and tail formation are disrupted. Further, we show for the first time, that KATNAL2 can function both independently or in concert with the katanin regulatory protein KATNB1 and that it can target the poorly characterized tubulin subunits delta and epsilon. Our research has immediate relevance to the origins of human male infertility and provides novel insights into aspects of microtubule regulation relevant to numerous tissues and species.
