Ovarian cancer (OC) is an aggressive disease with few valuable biomarkers and effective therapies. In this study, we aimed to elucidate biomarkers associated with OC metastasis into the omentum. We performed comprehensive screening of non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) between matched primary OC and omental metastasis using the Agilent human lncRNA Array V3.0 microarray. Reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) was used to validate the microarray results at the mRNA level. Microarray revealed 235 ncRNAs changes, and we validated the top four differential changed genes in an additional 27 paired samples with RT-qPCR. We found that myocardial infarction associated transcript (MIAT) expression increased in the omentum tissue, while small nucleolar RNA, C/D Box 114 cluster (SNORD114) family members SNORD114-10, SNORD114-2 and SNORD114-11 were downregulated when compared with OC tissue. However, there is no significant difference in SNORD114-2 and SNORD114-11 levels. We thus infer that differential expression of MIAT and SNORD114-10 could play an important role during OC metastasis. These ncRNAs might be useful as pre-diagnostic biomarkers at the early stage of cancer metastasis.
