Humans exhibit great genetic diversity. Understanding the factors that contribute to and sustain this diversity is an important research area. Not only can such understanding shed light on human origins, but it can also assist in the discovery of genes and genetic factors that contribute to debilitating diseases. Statistical analysis methods that can facilitate the identification of factors contributing to or associated with human genetic diversity are growing in number as new high-throughput molecular genetic assays and technologies are developed. We consider the use of an analysis method termed generalized analysis of molecular variance (GAMOVA), which builds off of previously proposed analysis methods for testing hypotheses about the factors associated with genetic background diversity. We apply the method in a wide variety of settings and show that it is both flexible and powerful. GAMOVA has great potential to assist in population-based human genetic studies, as it can be used to address questions such as: Is a sample of affected cases and unaffected controls from a homogeneous population, or is there evidence of heterogeneity that could affect the results of an association study? Is there reason to believe that the ancestry of a set of individuals influences the traits that they have?
