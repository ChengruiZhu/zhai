To protect themselves from pathogens, plants detect pathogen attack and send this information through a signaling network that activates various immune responses. Pathogens secrete effectors that disable components of the immune signaling network. Thus, the function of the plant immune signaling network must be well buffered from effector perturbations. Not much is known about how such network buffering is achieved. This is partly because the effects of mutations in single network components are also well buffered by the network. To overcome this shortcoming of single-gene mutant analysis, we employed a network reconstitution strategy, in which four major signaling sectors were first disabled and then restored one by one to determine the functions of the signaling sectors and their interactions. We collected and analyzed transcriptome and hormone profiles from all possible states of network reconstitution along time courses after immune stimulation with bacterial flagellin. We discovered that the network is not a collection of independent pathways; rather, interactions among the sectors dominate network regulation of the transcriptome response, which explains the extensive network buffering observed. Consequently, apparent network mechanisms inferred based on single-gene mutant analysis were often different from the underlying mechanisms.
