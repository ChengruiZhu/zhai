Derivation of bona fide porcine pluripotent stem cells is still a critical issue because porcine embryonic stem cells (ESCs) are not available yet, and most of the culture conditions to maintain porcine induced pluripotent stem cells (piPSCs) are based on conditions for mouse and human iPS cells. In this study, we generated a doxycycline-inducible porcine iPS cell line (DOX-iPSCs) and used it to screen the optimal culture condition to sustain the self-renewal of piPSCs. We found that LIF and b-FGF were required for porcine cell reprogramming, but were not essential cytokines for maintaining the self-renewal and pluripotency of piPSCs. A serum-free 3i medium, which includes three inhibitors CHIR99021, SB431542, and PD0325901, three cytokines BMP4, SCF, and IL-6, and human platelet lysates (PL), was made through serious selections. In 3i condition, the doxycycline-inducible iPSCs could be passaged for a long term without the addition of doxycycline, and the flattened morphology of intermediate state piPSCs could convert to the na√Øve-like morphology with the increase in endogenous pluripotent gene expressions. Additionally, pPSC cell line isolated from 5.5 days blastocysts could be sustained in 3i medium and the expression of endogenous pluripotent genes
