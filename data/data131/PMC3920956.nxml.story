Hematopoiesis and commitment to a restricted lineage are guided by a timely expressed set of cytokine receptors and their downstream transcription factors. A member of the mRNA export complex, THOC5 (suppressors of the transcriptional defects of hpr1 delta by overexpression complex 5) is a substrate for several tyrosine kinases such as macrophage colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF) receptor and various leukemogenic tyrosine kinases, such as Bcr-Abl, or NPM-ALK. THOC5 tyrosine phosphorylation is elevated in stem cells from patients with chronic myeloid leukemia, suggesting that THOC5 may be involved in leukemia development. THOC5 is also an essential element in the maintenance of hematopoiesis in adult mice. In this report, we show that THOC5 is located in the nuclear speckles, and that it is translocated from the nucleus to cytoplasm during M-CSF-induced bone marrow-derived macrophage differentiation. Furthermore, we have identified THOC5 target genes by trancriptome analysis, using tamoxifen-inducible THOC5 knockout macrophages. Although only 99 genes were downregulated in THOC5-depleted macrophages, half of the genes are involved in differentiation and/or migration. These include well-known regulators of myeloid differentiation inhibitor of DNA binding (
