Vertebrate genomes are littered with remnants from earlier retroviral infections, in the form of endogenous retroviruses (ERVs). Cellular host defenses against retroviruses, including the APOBEC3 family of cytidine deaminases, have been described previously. APOBEC3 proteins have been shown to edit some retroviruses and other retrotransposing elements during their replication by deamination of C to U during negative-strand synthesis, resulting in G-to-A mutations in the sense strand. Here, we studied the possible effects that the APOBEC-protein family might have had in the establishing ERVs. We identified 49 endogenous (nonecotropic) murine leukemia viruses, divided into three groups; polytropic, modified polytropic, and xenotropic, in the sequenced C57BL/6J mouse genome. We analyzed genetic variation within and among subgroups and found mutation patterns consistent with APOBEC3 editing of Pmv and Mpmv, but not Xmv proviruses. Evidence such as (i) significantly higher G-to-A mutation frequencies compared to controls and large fractions leading to inactivating stop mutations, (ii) optimal sequence contexts surrounding the mutation positions, and (iii) editing gradient following the time course of retroviral replication, implicate APOBEC3 as a factor contributing to inactivation of these ERVs in the mouse genome.
