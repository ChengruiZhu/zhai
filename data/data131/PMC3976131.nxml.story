 Matrigel assay in nude mice (n=12). For the diabetic wound model, 48 Balb/c mice with streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetes were divided randomly into 4 groups (12 mice in each group). Subsequently, 3, 5 and 7 days before a 15-mm full-thickness incisional skin wound was set, group 1 was pre-treated subcutaneously with a mixture of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)/basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF)/platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) (3.5 μg of each), group 2 with 3.5 μg PDGF and group 3 with an aliquot of two million EPCs, whereas the control animals (group 4) were pre-treated with 0.2 ml saline solution. The wounds were assessed daily and the repaired tissues were harvested 7 days after complete wound closure. The angiogenesis assay demonstrated significantly increased sprout densities, areas and lengths in the EPC-treated group (all p<0.01). In the Matrigel assay, significantly increased microvessel densities, areas and sizes (all p<0.001) were also detected in the EPC-treated group. In the STZ-induced model of diabetes, the animals pre-treated with a combination of proangiogenic factors and EPCs showed in general, a more rapid wound closure. Vessel densities were >2-fold higher in the mice treated with a combination of proangiogenic factors and EPCs (p<0.05) and tensile strengths were higher in the groups treated with proangiogenic growth factors compared to the controls (p<0.05). These results suggest a beneficial effect of pre-treatment with proangiogenic growth factors and EPCs in incisional wound healing.
