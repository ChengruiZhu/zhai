 That portion of horse and human serum globulin precipitated by 33 per cent saturation with ammonium sulfate and precipitated on subsequent dialysis was taken as euglobulin; and the fraction precipitated between 33 and 50 per cent saturation and remaining in solution on subsequent dialysis was taken as pseudoglobulin. The sera of rabbits injected with either of these antigens gave precipitation with both. However, two distinct and fraction-specific antibodies could be demonstrated by absorbing the sera with the one antigen, and testing the supernatant fluid with the other. The experimental results are adequately explained on the basis that there are at least two antigenically distinct globulins in serum which we may term globulin I and globulin II and which are largely associated with so called euglobulin and pseudoglobulin respectively. The ordinary methods of salting out and dialysis do not effect complete separation and each globulin preparation contains a trace of the other antigen. The antisera to these euglobulin and pseudoglobulin preparations therefore contain antibodies to both antigens. Each protein solution precipitates all the antibody specific for the one antigen and in addition, by virtue of the trace of contaminating protein, precipitates a
