It was recently shown that the network of connections between different areas of the macaque cortex has strong structural specificity in terms of the strength of connections as a function of the distance between areas. This has led to a model of cortex connectivity that predicts many observed architectural features, including the existence of a strong core-periphery organization. When viewed across species, increases in brain size are accompanied by a relative decrease in connectivity, and thus an important question is whether there are architectural commonalities in the cortical networks within the mammalian branch. Here, based on tract tracing data from the folded macaque brain and the smooth mouse brain, we introduce a common model framework that allows network comparisons between species. We show that despite important differences in size, the cortices of both species share several network invariants, suggesting that the mammalian cortex exhibits universal architectural principals. This framework also captures differences between the two brains, including the fact that, unlike the macaque, the mouse core includes primary areas and that there is a relative decrease in the frequency of long-distance connections in the large macaque cortex compared to mouse. This approach allows network architectural extrapolations to the human cortex.
