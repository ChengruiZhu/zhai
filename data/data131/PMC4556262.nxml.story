One hundred and fifty-nine intermediate uveitis, posterior uveitis, and panuveitis patients (237 eyes) were identified. The patient population was 54.72% female; 67.30% of patients were Caucasian, and 22.01% were Africanâ€“American. Mean age at diagnosis was 45.5 years. Mean duration of follow-up was 3.95 years. Mean number of visits to the clinic was 10.35. Of 491 uveitis patients, 26 (5.30%) had intermediate uveitis, 62 (12.60%) had posterior uveitis, and 71 (14.50%) had panuveitis. The leading diagnoses in the intermediate uveitis group were pars planitis (73.08%) and sarcoidosis (11.54%); toxoplasma uveitis (17.74%), multifocal choroiditis (14.52%), undifferentiated posterior uveitis (14.52%), and birdshot chorioretinitis (11.29%) in the posterior uveitis group; and undifferentiated panuveitis (29.58%), post-surgical panuveitis (18.31%), sarcoidosis (12.68%), acute retinal necrosis (12.68%), and toxoplasma uveitis (4.23%) in the panuveitis group. The most common treatment modalities included local steroids (57.23%) and systemic steroids (42.14%). Ocular hypertension was found in 38 patients (23.90%). Glaucoma surgery was performed in 18.24% of patients and cataract surgery in 21.38%. Mean best-corrected visual acuity was 0.66 logMAR at baseline across all anatomical locations and 0.57 logMAR at final follow-up. Best-corrected visual acuity improved or remained stable during follow-up in all groups.
