 and Fisher’s exact tests, as well as MANOVA. Kaplan-Meier curves were generated. The study cohort had a mean age of 54±13 years old with a mean follow-up period of 51±21 months. Of 468 patients, 249 (53%) underwent lumpectomy, 63 (14%) underwent simple mastectomy (SM) and 156 (33%) underwent modified radical mastectomy (MRM). Overall, 263 (56%) received adjuvant radiation, including 178/249 (71%) following lumpectomy, 13/63 (21%) following SM and 72/156 (46%) following MRM (P<0.0001). Following control for potential confounders in univariate tests, adjuvant radiation was associated with improved overall survival in the total cohort (HR, 0.46; 95% CI, 0.31–0.68; P=0.0001). When comparing survival by surgical type, receipt of adjuvant radiation significantly improved survival in the lumpectomy group (HR, 0.30; 95% CI, 0.16–0.58; P=0.0004), but was not associated with improved survival in the SM group (HR, 0.38; 95% CI, 0.05–3.04; P=0.36) or in the MRM group (HR, 0.79; 95% CI, 0.46–1.34; P=0.38). The survival benefit of adjuvant radiation in these TNBC patients is attributed to those undergoing breast-conserving therapy. There was no benefit in either mastectomy group. These data warrant validation from prospective trials, in order to develop tailored locoregional treatment for patients with TNBC.
