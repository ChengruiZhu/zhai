Homeostasis of blood glucose concentrations during circadian shifts in survival-related activities, sleep and food availability is crucial for the survival of mammals. This process depends upon glucose intake, short-term storage as glycogen, and gluconeogenesis. The integration of hepatic glycogen anabolic and catabolic dynamics with whole body energetics is critical for survival. In this paper we use computational modeling to investigate the potential survival advantage of substrate (futile) cycling of glycogen and glycogen precursors. Our simulations, combined with published experimental results of other researchers, indicate that as the body enters a state of fasting, the activity of enzymes involved in the synthesis of glycogen increases leading to increased substrate cycling. This increase in substrate cycling allows the system to respond more rapidly once new external sources of glucose become available. The whole-body computational model developed for this work allows the metabolic control circuitry to be studied under simulated in vivo conditions, providing functional insights that are not evident when individual modules of glycogen regulatory circuitry are examined in isolation.
