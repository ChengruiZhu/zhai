Rhythmic behavior is omnipresent in biology and has many crucial functions. In cells the activation levels and abundances of signaling molecules such as NF-ÎºB, p53, EGFR or calcium repeatedly increase and decrease in response to stimuli. Such a dynamic behavior can also be observed monitoring the concentrations of mRNAs and proteins in the circadian clock and the cell cycle. Period and amplitude which are the time span between peaks and the peak height, respectively, as well as their variabilities are important features of oscillations. The circadian period is very stable allowing for proper time keeping, whereas in calcium signaling the period is very variable encoding different stimulation strengths. Our goal is to examine the origin of differences in sensitivities of periods and amplitudes using a computational approach. We use prototype oscillators and demonstrate that they can be used to derive general principles that explain the degree of robustness in period and amplitude for a set of commonly used models of cellular oscillators. Our findings imply that the robustness of oscillating systems can be influenced by feedback type and kinetic properties to which special attention should be paid when designing mathematical models of cellular rhythms.
