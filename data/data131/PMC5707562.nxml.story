This study investigated the expression of RASSF1A and SIRT6 in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and its relationship with clinical prognosis. The expression in 122 cases of NSCLC tissues (NSCLC group) and 122 cases of normal lung tissues (NOR group) during the same period were detected by immunohistochemical Super Pic Ture™ Polymer two-step method, and the relationship between its expression and the clinicopathological features and prognosis of patients was analyzed. The positive expression rates of RASSF1A and SIRT6 in NSCLC group were lower than those in the normal group (55.74 vs. 84.43% and 52.46 vs. 82.49%, P<0.01). The differences in expression intensity of RASSF1A in NSCLC tissues between different tumor pathological types, tumor differentiation degrees and lymph node metastases were statistically significant, and the differences in expression intensity of SIRT6 between different TNM stages, tumor differentiation degrees and lymph node metastases were statistically significant. There was a positive correlation between the expression of RASSF1A and SIRT6 in NSCLC group (r=0.532, P<0.01). The 3-year survival rate of patients with high-expression of RASSF1A was higher than in those with low-expression of RASSF1A (81.33 vs. 39.45%, log-rank χ
