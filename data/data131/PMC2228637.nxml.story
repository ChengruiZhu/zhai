ATP stimulates Na transport into inside-out vesicles (IOVs) made from human red cell membranes; strophanthidin inhibits the ATP-stimulated transport. The substrates for glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) and phosphoglycerate kinase (PGK) (glycolytic enzymes bound to the cytoplasmic surface of the red cell membrane) also stimulate Na transport into IOVs without added ATP. The elution of GAPDH from the membranes prevents the stimulation by the substrates, but not by exogenous ATP. Hexokinase plus glucose (agents that promote breakdown of ATP) prevent stimulation of Na transport by exogenous ATP but not by the substrates for GAPDH and PGK. [32P]orthophosphate is incorporated into a membrane-bound organic phosphate compound shown chromatographically to be ATP. The level of membrane-bound ATP is decreased when Na is added, and this decrease is inhibited by strophanthidin. When further synthesis of [32P]ATP is blocked by the addition of unlabeled orthophosphate, all of the membrane-bound [32P]ATP is dissipated by the addition of Na. From these observations it was concluded that membrane-bound glycolytic enzymes synthesize ATP and deposit it in a membrane-associated compartment from which it is used by the Na/K pump.
