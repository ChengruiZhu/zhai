For decades, cardiovascular physiology has been an area of intense research, and we have a fundamental understanding of the mechanisms the heart uses to drive blood flow through the distributed network of vessels in the body. The lymphatic system is now receiving similar attention as more is learned about its functional role in disease processes. The importance of the lymphatic system in collecting excess fluid from tissues and returning it to the blood is well known, but how the lymph flow is regulated without a central pump is poorly understood. Each segment of collecting lymphatic vessel can independently contract yielding a network of distributed pump/conduits. This paper shows how the lymphatic muscle cells that squeeze fluid along the lymphatic vessels can be effectively regulated using only chemical and mechanical signals that they receive from their immediate microenvironment. Using stability theory and the tools of nonlinear dynamics we identify two complementary oscillators that respond to stretch of the vessel wall and shear of fluid flowing over the vessel wall. Numerical simulations of the combined oscillators show that they have characteristics well suited to the regulation of distributed systems in general and may have application in other biological and physical contexts.
