Chimpanzee is the closest relative to humans having DNA sequences about 98% identical to each other. Small DNA sequence changes and probably more importantly, larger structural changes of chromosomes, led to the divergence of the two species some 6 million years ago. Until recently, there were ten structural differences visible under the microscope between chimpanzee and human, and nine of these were inversions of DNA. Through computational comparisons of genome sequences, the current study identifies another 1,576 putative inversion events. Thirty-three of these were larger than 100,000 base pairs in size and 29 intersect genes, prioritizing them for evolutionary studies. Twenty-three of the inversions have been confirmed experimentally with the largest being 4.3 million base pairs in size on human Chromosome 7. Surprisingly, three of the “inverted” regions were found to be variable in their orientation in the human population (in some cases the inversion was in the ancestral orientation found in chimpanzee). These observations indicate the human genome is still evolving in structure. Moreover, since such variable inversions have been shown to predispose to other (sometimes deleterious) changes in chromosomes, the new data delineate potential disease-associated genes.
