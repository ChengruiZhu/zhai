Dendrimers are well-defined branched symmetrical macromolecules. In biologically based experiments, we have shown that a generation 3.5 PAMAM dendrimer whose surface was modified with 8 surface glucosamine molecules inhibited TLR4 mediated cytokine inflammation in both primary human cells and a clinically validated rabbit model of tissue scaring. Molecular dynamics simulations also showed that these molecules had the flexibility, surface electrostatic charge, and hydrophilicity to make them therapeutically useful antagonists. Central to the TLR4-MD-2-LPS cell surface complex is binding of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) to soluble MD-2. We now show that dendrimer glucosamine forms co-operative electrostatic interactions with residues lining the entrance to MD-2's hydrophobic pocket. These interactions block the entry of the lipid chains of LPS into MD-2's hydrophobic pocket and prevent complex formation. We have therefore defined the first nonlipid-based synthetic MD-2 antagonist using both animal model based studies and molecular modelling studies of a whole dendrimer with its target protein. Using this approach, it should now be possible to computationally design additional macromolecular dendrimer based antagonists for other Toll Like Receptors. They could be useful for treating a spectrum of infectious, inflammatory and malignant diseases.
