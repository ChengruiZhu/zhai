The purpose of this study was to compare the hypotensive responses of reciprocal supersets (SS) versus traditional training (TRAD) methods. Thirteen men with at least five years of recreational experience in resistance training (RT) volunteered for the study. When completing the TRAD protocol, participants performed the following exercises separately in sequence: chest press (CP), low row (LR), leg extension (LE), leg curl (LC), pull down (PD), and shoulder press (SP). The SS method required participants to complete the same exercises as in the TRAD protocol, but exercises were coupled such that muscles sequentially served both as an agonist for lift one and then antagonist for lift two and vice versa. Exercise order used was CP and LR, LE and LC, and PD and SP with 10 repetition maximum loads. Blood pressure (BP) was measured before and for every 10 minutes for one hour after training. There was significantly more total work (TW) done in the TRAD condition compared to SS. Post exercise hypotension was evident only after the TRAD session at minutes 30 and 40 for systolic BP. Significant differences between the TRAD and SS methods were found at 20 minutes, 30 minutes, and 40 minutes for systolic BP. There was no significant two-way interaction for group × time for diastolic BP. There was a significant two-way interaction for group × time for mean arterial pressure. Significant reductions for mean arterial pressure (MAP) occurred only in the TRAD method after 30 to 40 minutes compared to the baseline values. Therefore, a TRAD RT method was sufficient to cause a hypotensive effect after the training session whereas the SS method did not reveal significant decreases in BP after the session. However, these findings are important to elucidate concerns regarding the post-exercise hypotension after RT and showed that TW might be the key to promote these changes because the volume of training was shown to be an important training variable to manipulate and might be associated with BP hypotension after RT.
