T helper (Th) cells, a subgroup of white blood cells important in the immune system, can differentiate into diverse lineages, for example Th1 and Th2, whose effector mechanisms target different types of pathogens but cause problems if not properly regulated. Lineage commitment is driven by cytokine signals that control the expression of distinct lineage-specifying “master regulator” transcription factor molecules. Lineage commitment is thought to reflect alternative cell-fate decisions because the initiated differentiation programs have self-amplifying and mutually repressive features. Here we show that the Th1 and Th2 differentiation programs are more compatible with each other than previously thought. Individual naive T cells can simultaneously integrate Th1- and Th2-polarizing signals and develop into hybrid Th1/2 cells that stably co-express both the Th1 master regulator T-bet and the Th2 master regulator GATA-3. We find that hybrid Th1/2 cells arise naturally during parasite infections and that the two opposing differentiation programs can stably co-exist in resting memory Th1/2 cells for periods of months. Th1- or Th2-polarizing stimuli induced quantitative modulations in the hybrid state but did not extinguish either program. The cell-intrinsic antagonism gives the hybrid Th1/2 cells properties that are quantitatively intermediate between those of Th1 and Th2 cells. Thus, in typical Th1 and Th2 immune responses, hybrid Th1/2 cells cause less immunopathology than their classic Th1 or Th2 counterparts, demonstrating a cell-intrinsic self-limiting mechanism that can prevent excessive inflammation.
