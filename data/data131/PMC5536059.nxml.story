-EP3 signalling in cervical cancer, so the aim of the study was to analyse the expression of the EP3 receptor in cervical cancer and find prognostic factors in relation to survival; EP3 immunohistological staining of 250 cervical cancer slides was performed and analysed with a semi-quantitative score. The statistical evaluation was performed with Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) to evaluate the staining results and the survival analyses of the cervical cancer cases. A significant difference was observed in EP3 expression in Fédération Internationale de Gynécologie et d’Obstétrique (FIGO) stadium I versus FIGO stadium II–IV cases. High expression of EP3 (IRS ≥ 1.5) in cervical cancer patients was correlated with poor prognosis in overall survival rates. Survival in adenocarcinoma (AC) of the cervix was lower than in squamous cell carcinoma (SCC). Cox regression analysis shows that EP3 is an independent prognosticator. In this study we could show that the membrane-bound prostaglandin receptor EP3 is an independent prognosticator for cervical cancer patient survival. Targeting the EP3 receptor seems to be an interesting candidate for endocrine therapy. Therefore, more research is needed on the influence of the receptor system and its influence on cervical cancer growth.
