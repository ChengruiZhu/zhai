A fundamental problem in neurobiology is to understand how memories are maintained for up to years. Long-term potentiation (LTP), an enduring increase in the strength of specific connections (synapses) between neurons, is thought to comprise, at least in part, the substrate of learning and memory. What processes transduce brief stimuli into persistent LTP? Persistent increased activity of an enzyme denoted protein kinase M ζ (PKMζ) is thought essential for maintaining LTP. Only synapses that have been “tagged” by a stimulus, such as stimuli needed for LTP and learning, can “capture” PKMζ. We developed a model simulating dynamics of key molecules required for LTP and its opposite, long-term depression (LTD). The model concisely represents relationships between tagging, capture, LTD, and LTP maintenance. It makes testable predictions concerning the dynamics of PKMζ. The maintenance of LTP and memory is predicted to require positive feedback in which PKMζ enhances its own synthesis at potentiated synapses. Without synaptic capture of PKMζ, no positive feedback would occur. LTD induction is also predicted to increase PKMζ synthesis. The model also makes predictions about regulation of PKMζ synthesis. Experiments testing the above predictions would advance the understanding of memory maintenance.
