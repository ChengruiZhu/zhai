The capacity of the influenza virus to rapidly mutate and render resistance to a handful of FDA approved neuraminidase (NA) inhibitors represents a significant human health concern. To gain an atomic-level understanding of the mechanisms behind drug resistance, we applied a novel computational approach to characterize resistant NA mutations. These results are comparable in accuracy and precision with the best experimental measurements presently available. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that a rigorous computational method has attained the level of certainty needed to predict subtle changes in binding free energies conferred by mutations. Analysis of our simulation data provided a thorough description of the thermodynamics of the binding process for different NA-inhibitor complexes, with findings that in some cases challenge current views based on interpretations of the crystallographic data. While we did not find a generalized mechanism of NA resistance, we identified key differences between oseltamivir and zanamivir that discriminate their responses to the three mutations we considered, namely H274Y, N294S and Y252H. It is worth noting that our approach can be broadly applied to predict resistant mutations to existing and newly developed drugs in other important drug targets.
