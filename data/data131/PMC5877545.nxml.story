Neutrophils are key players in the early defense against invading pathogens. Due to their potent effector functions, programmed cell death of activated neutrophils has to be tightly controlled; however, its underlying mechanisms remain unclear. Fas ligand (FASL/CD95L) has been shown to induce neutrophil apoptosis, which is accelerated by the processing of the BH3-only protein BH3 interacting domain death agonist (BID) to trigger mitochondrial apoptotic events, and been attributed a regulatory role during viral and bacterial infections. Here, we show that, in accordance with previous works, mouse neutrophils underwent caspase-dependent apoptosis in response to FASL, and that this cell death was significantly delayed upon loss of BID. However, pan-caspase inhibition failed to protect mouse neutrophils from FASL-induced apoptosis and caused a switch to RIPK3-dependent necroptotic cell death. Intriguingly, such a switch was less evident in the absence of BID, particularly under inflammatory conditions. Delayed neutrophil apoptosis has been implicated in several auto-inflammatory diseases, including inflammatory bowel disease. We show that neutrophil and macrophage driven acute dextran sulfate sodium (DSS) induced colitis was slightly more aggravated in BID-deficient mice, based on significantly increased weight loss compared to wild-type controls. Taken together, our data support a central role for FASL > FAS and BID in mouse neutrophil cell death and further underline the anti-inflammatory role of BID.
