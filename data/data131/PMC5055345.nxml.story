Gene transcription is a complex process that starts with the recruitment and positioning of Pol-II enzyme at the transcription start site (TSS). Specific promoter sequences, known as core promoter elements (CPEs) facilitate this process. Surprisingly, only a fraction of promoters contain them. It is still unknown how Pol-II choses the start site in their absence. A recently proposed alternative mechanism implicates positioned nucleosomes in the TSS selection. Here, we provide new evidence of the existence of such mechanism with a comparative analysis of promoter’s features across the animal kingdom. We analysed the promoter’s DNA sequence composition in 5 organisms and found conserved and unique consensus sequences used to organize chromatin in the region of the first nucleosome downstream the TSS (N+1). Moreover, we found that all organisms show a strong correlation between the spread of Pol-II initiation and the strength of the DNA-encoded signal in the N+1 region. A detailed analysis of Pol-II initiation sites reveals also the presence of a 10 bp periodicity that is correlated with the intensity of the DNA signal in the N+1 region. Importantly, we report that genetic variants that alter the DNA-nucleosome affinity in that region alter Pol-II initiation spread as well.
