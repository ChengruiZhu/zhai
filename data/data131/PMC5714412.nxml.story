Cone‐beam computed tomography (CBCT) is used for external‐beam radiation therapy setup and target localization. As with all medical applications of ionizing radiation, radiation exposure should be managed safely and optimized to achieve the necessary image quality using the lowest possible dose. The present study investigates doses from standard kilovoltage kV radiographic and CBCT imaging protocol, and proposes two novel reduced dose CBCT protocols for the setup of breast cancer patients undergoing external beam radiotherapy. The standard thorax kV and low‐dose thorax CBCT protocols available on Varian's On‐Board Imaging system was chosen as the reference technique for breast imaging. Two new CBCT protocols were created by modifying the low‐dose thorax protocol, one with a reduced gantry rotation range (“Under breast” protocol) and the other with a reduced tube current‐time product setting (“Low dose thorax 10ms” protocol). The absorbed doses to lungs, heart, breasts, and skin were measured using XRQA2 radiochromic film in an anthropomorphic female phantom. The absorbed doses to lungs, heart, and breasts were also calculated using the PCXMC Monte Carlo simulation software. The effective dose was calculated using the measured doses to the included organs and the ICRP 103 tissue weighting factors. The deviation between measured and simulated organ doses was between 3% and 24%. Reducing the protocol exposure time to half of its original value resulted in a reduction in the absorbed doses of the organs of 50%, while the reduced rotation range resulted in a dose reduction of at least 60%. Absorbed doses obtained from “Low dose thorax 10ms” protocol were higher than the doses from our departments orthogonal kV‐kV imaging protocol. Doses acquired from “Under breast” protocol were comparable to the doses measured from the orthogonal kV‐kV imaging protocol. The effective dose per fraction using the CBCT for standard low‐dose thorax protocol was
