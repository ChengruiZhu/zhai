134 subjects met our inclusion criteria. 34/134 (25.4%) had significant lateral compartment chondral surface change, 32/134 (23.9%) had significant medial compartment chondral surface change, and 31/134 (23.1%) had significant patellofemoral chondral surface change. Median age at time of revision was 19.5 years [IQ range 17-25] and median time from primary to revision was 462.5 days [IQ range 292-1049]. KOOS and IKDC at revision were not associated with significant chondral surface change in any compartment. Patients with >33% of their lateral meniscus excised had 13.5 times the odds of having significant lateral compartment surface change compared to subjects who either did not have lateral meniscal damage, had it repaired, or had an excision of ≤33% controlling for age (p<0.001). Patients with ≤33% excision of their medial meniscus had 4.5 times the odds of significant medial compartment surface change compared to subjects who either did not have medial meniscal damage, had it repaired, or had an excision >33% controlling for age (p=0.02). Patients had 9% increased odds of significant patellofemoral compartment surface change for each increased point on the BMI scale controlling for age (p=0.05). Odds of significant chondral surface change increased by 5% for each increased year of age (p ≤0.02) in all compartments. Median time from primary to revision surgery, age, and Marx are summarized by chondral change and meniscal status in Table 1.
