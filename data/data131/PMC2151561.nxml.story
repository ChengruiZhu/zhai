Human olfaction comprises the opposing actions of excitation and inhibition triggered by odorant molecules. In olfactory receptor neurons, odorant molecules not only trigger a G-proteinâ€“coupled signaling cascade but also generate various mechanisms to fine tune the odorant-induced current, including a low-selective odorant inhibition of the olfactory signal. This wide-range olfactory inhibition has been suggested to be at the level of ion channels, but definitive evidence is not available. Here, we report that the cyclic nucleotide-gated (CNG) cation channel, which is a key element that converts odorant stimuli into electrical signals, is inhibited by structurally unrelated odorants, consistent with the expression of wide-range olfactory inhibition. Interestingly, the inhibitory effect was small in the homo-oligomeric CNG channel composed only of the principal channel subunit, CNGA2, but became larger in channels consisting of multiple types of subunits. However, even in the channel containing all native subunits, the potency of the suppression on the cloned CNG channel appeared to be smaller than that previously shown in native olfactory neurons. Nonetheless, our results further showed that odorant suppressions are small in native neurons if the subsequent molecular steps mediated by Ca
