The objectives were to compare patient preference for zolmitriptan nasal spray with their current acute therapies for migraine (by asking whether or not they wished to continue to use zolmitriptan nasal spray), to determine patientsâ€™ reasons for this choice and to evaluate efficacy of zolmitriptan nasal spray. Patients with an established diagnosis for migraine (IHC criteria) who were already receiving a migraine-specific treatment were enrolled in an open-label, clinical experience study in a clinical practice. Patients were invited to treat up to 6 migraine attacks with 5 mg of zolmitriptan nasal spray. Data from 232 patients were analysed. Most patients (89%) were already using a triptan as migraine treatment. The majority of patients (68.5%) wished to continue using zolmitriptan nasal spray; the most common reason being its fast onset of action. Almost half of the patients (47.8%) wishing to continue with zolmitriptan nasal spray reported few or no adverse events as a motivating reason. Of patients currently using sumatriptan nasal spray, tablet or injection, 90.9%, 74.2% and 70.6%, respectively, wanted to continue using zolmitriptan nasal spray. Most patients are satisfied with, and wish to continue using, zolmitriptan nasal spray.
