The lower eyelid retractors consist of double layers, the posterior layer of which is the main tractional component. Therefore, shortening of the posterior layer of the lower eyelid retractors causes lower eyelid retraction or cicatricial entropion. Based on this concept, we report a modified lower eyelid lengthening surgery involving complete recession of the posterior layer of the lower eyelid retractors by way of a transcutaneous approach that leaves the palpebral conjunctiva intact and inserts ear cartilage as a rigid spacer between the lower edge of the tarsal plate and the recessed anterior layer of the lower eyelid retractors. This procedure completely extirpated the preoperative maladjusted states of lower eyelid retraction and cicatricial entropion. Our procedure also prevented postoperative discomfort of the ocular surface due to the intact palpebral conjunctiva. As well, lower eyelid mobility and contour were good and within their respective permissible ranges. The lower eyelid lengthening surgery focusing on the posterior layer of the lower eyelid retractors using auricular cartilage via a transcutaneous approach is a useful procedure for lower eyelid retraction or cicatricial entropion.
