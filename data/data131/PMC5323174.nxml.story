EMT (epithelial-mesenchymal transition) occurs in a wide range of tumor types, and has been shown to be crucial for metastasis. Epigenetic modifications of histones contribute to chromatin structure and result in the alterations in gene expression. Tri-methylation of histone H3 lysine 4 (H3K4me3) is associated with the promoters of actively transcribed genes and can serve as a transcriptional on/off switch. RbBP5 is a component of the COMPASS/ -like complex, which catalyzes H3K4me3 formation. In this study, we found that in the process of TGF-Beta1 induced EMT in the prostate cancer cell line DU145, H3K4me3 enrichment and RbBP5 binding increased in the vicinity of Snail (SNAI1) transcription start site. Knocking-down of RbBP5 notably decreased Snail expression and EMT. Recruitment of RbBP5 and formation of H3K4me3 at Snail TSS during EMT depend on binding of SMAD2/3 and CBP at Snail TSS. This study links the SMAD2/3 signal with Snail transcription via a histone modification - H3K4me3. Furthermore, our research also demonstrates that RbBP5 and even WRAD may be a promising therapeutic candidates in treating prostate cancer metastasis, and that DU145 cells maintain their incomplete mesenchymal state in an auto/paracrine manner.
