Cardiac troponins are the most sensitive and specific markers of myocardial injury. In fact, the Joint European Society of Cardiology/American College of Cardiology committee for the redefinition of myocardial infarction (MI) states that troponins are the preferred cardiac marker for detecting myocardial injury. For the aforementioned reasons, troponin levels are routinely ordered for patients presenting to the emergency department with chest pain, dyspnea, syncope, or any other possible presentations of MI. While troponin levels do reflect the extent of myocardial damage, they do not necessarily indicate myocardial ischemia in a subset of patients. Elevated troponin levels can be due to a wide array of mechanisms in the absence of myocardial ischemia and injury. Thus, relying solely on troponin levels, in the presence of a normal electrocardiogram (ECG), to diagnose myocardial ischemia can lead to unnecessary and expensive invasive testing. It is therefore important for the clinician to keep in mind the varying causes of troponin elevations in order to provide the highest value care to the patient. We present a case and review of literature regarding patients who present with elevated troponin levels in the absence of any coronary artery disease.
