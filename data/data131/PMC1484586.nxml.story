The duplication of genes is considered one of the major sources of biological diversity, as it provides the necessary conditions for the generation of new gene types and functions. Even though, after a gene is duplicated, one of the copies normally undergoes inactivation, it can eventually establish in the genome as a novel gene with new functionality. The identification of the molecular basis of gene duplication and the forces that determine the fate of the resulting copies is essential to understand how genes and, ultimately, organisms evolve. The first step in this direction is the identification of duplicated genes and pseudogenes, which still remains a challenge for standard procedures of automated genome annotation. The authors have developed a methodology that comprehensively identifies and classifies these regions, and provide the collections of duplicated genes and pseudogenes found in the human and mouse genomes. Among these, there are 420 previously unidentified potentially functional genes, which include examples of partial duplicates with less than half of the length of the original source genes. Furthermore, they also provide preliminary novel biological insight into the mechanism of gene duplication, which will constitute the starting point for further studies of the fates and evolution of duplicated genes.
