Informed consent implies that the person undergoing an intervention thoroughly understands its pros and cons. We conducted a randomized control trial to evaluate patients’ recall of complications after day case hand surgery and how this can be influenced by age and/or socioeconomic factors. Patients’ wishes on the extent and type of provided information were also evaluated. A total of 124 cases were recruited. Ten cases were excluded because they presented for follow up more than 2 weeks after surgery. The other patients were randomized into 2 groups: the first one (48) received only verbal information, while the second one (66) also received written information sheets. No statistically significant difference was noted in the recall between the two groups. No difference among gender, age or socioeconomic status was noted. Most patients preferred both written and verbal information. Preference for knowledge of rates of complications increased when surgery was dangerous. Our results don’t show any significant difference in patients’ recall depending on the type of consenting method. Nevertheless, we still propose that patients should receive as much information as possible before undergoing any intervention.
