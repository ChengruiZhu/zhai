Many transmembrane receptors have been shown to aggregate into supramolecular clusters that enhance sensitivity to external stimuli in a variety of cell types. Advances in super-resolution microscopy have enabled researchers to study these structures with sufficient detail to distinguish the precise locations of individual receptors. In the heart, efforts have been successful in imaging calcium release channels, which are found in clusters of up to ∼ 100 in the sarcoplasmic reticulum membrane of cardiac myocytes. We showed in a recent study how the precise cluster structure affects the frequency of spontaneous release events known as calcium “sparks.” Here we have developed an analytical model of calcium spark initiation that clearly illustrates how the structure controls spark likelihood. We then applied this model to a collection of channel cluster structures obtained using super-resolution microscopy, revealing spatial gradients in the functional properties of individual channels. This work provides insight into the calcium release process in the heart and a framework for evaluating functional heterogeneity in populations of receptor clusters using structural information alone.
