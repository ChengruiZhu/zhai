Thirty-one patients who suffered anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injury and underwent ACL reconstruction (16 single-bundle, 15 double-bundle) with ENDOBUTTON between November 2007 and March 2008 were included in the study. Isokinetic and concentric strength measurements of the quadriceps and hamstring muscles at the 6th month and 8th year were made using a Biodex 3 device at angular velocities of 60°/sec, 120°/sec and 180°/sec. The peak torque and peak torque to body weight ratios were recorded. 3D-CT scans of the joints were performed on the 2nd, 3 rd and 6th month and 8th year. CT slices were divided into six equal parts marking the distance between the femoral and tibial tunnels with the most distant part of the knee joint as L1, and with the entry point on the knee joint as L6. The tunnel length was measured in millimeters and perpendicularly to the tibial axis in the sagittal and coronal planes. Tunnel cross-sectional areas were also measured in mm2 using the same device on axial reconstructions. Clinical evaluations on the 8th year were performed with the IKDC, Tegner and Lysholm knee scoring systems and laxity in the patients was evaluated with the anterior drawer test. Posterolateral tunnel widening was analyzed with the repeated measures ANOVA technique whereas two-way mixed ANOVA was employed in evaluating the anteromedial tunnel widening. Three-way ANOVA was used in assessing the Biodex results and comparison of the scoring systems results were done with the t-test.
