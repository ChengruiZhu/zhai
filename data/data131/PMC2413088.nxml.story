Catalytic adsorptive stripping voltammetry (CAdSV) has been demonstrated at a bismuth film electrode (BiFE) in an injection-moulded electrochemical micro-flow cell. The polystyrene three-electrode flow cell was fabricated with electrodes moulded from a conducting grade of polystyrene containing 40% carbon fibre, one of which was precoated with Ag to enable its use as an on-chip Ag/AgCl reference electrode. CAdSV of Co(II) and Ni(II) in the presence of dimethylglyoxime (DMG) with nitrite employed as the catalyst was performed in order to assess the performance of the flow cell with an in-line plated BiFE. The injection-moulded electrodes were found to be suitable substrates for the formation of BiFEs. Key parameters such as the plating solution matrix, plating flow rate, analysis flow rate, solution composition and square-wave parameters have been characterised and optimal conditions selected for successful and rapid analysis of Co(II) and Ni(II) at the ppb level. The analytical response was linear over the range 1 to 20 ppb and deoxygenation of the sample solution was not required. The successful coupling of a microfluidic flow cell with a BiFE, thereby forming a “mercury-free” AdSV flow analysis sensor, shows promise for industrial and in-the-field applications where inexpensive, compact, and robust instrumentation capable of low-volume analysis is required.
