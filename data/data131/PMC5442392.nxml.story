Signal transducers and activators of transcription (STAT) is a family of transcription factors which regulate cell proliferation, differentiation, apoptosis, metastasis, immune and inflammatory responses, and angiogenesis. STAT3 is a latent cytoplasmic transcription factor that belongs to STATs. STAT3 has been reported be regulates genes involved with cellular growth, proliferation and metastasis. Worldwide, colon cancer is one of the leading causes of cancer-related deaths. Cumulative evidence has established that STAT3 is essential for colon cancer progression to advanced malignancy. In our study, we showed that microRNA-1299 (miR-1299) was closely related to the TNM stage of colon cancer, and that the expression of miR-1299 was negatively correlated with the expression of STAT3 in colon cancer which means that miR-1299 can be a negative regulator of STAT3 in colon cancer. A total of 60 cases of different grades of colon samples were used to detect the expression of miR-1299. Results showed that miR-1299 was significantly lower in high-grade colons both in mRNA and protein levels. Furthermore, Overall survival (OS) in patients with low miR-1299 is shorter than 25.6 months, as compared with an OS of 28.4 months in patients with high level of miR-1299. We also confirmed that the overexpression of miR-1299 can not only downregulate the STAT3 pathway, but also inhibited colon cancer cell growth. Our findings could provide new insights into the molecular therapeutic of colon cancer.
