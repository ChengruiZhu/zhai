 epithelial progenitor tissues via the transcriptional coactivator Yorkie (Yki). However, despite the tissue-nonspecific role that Yki plays in tissue growth, the transcription factors that recruit Yki to DNA, most notably Scalloped (Sd) and Homothorax (Hth), are important regulators of developmental patterning with many tissue-specific functions. Thus, these three transcriptional regulators – Yki, Sd, and Hth – provide a model for exploring the properties of protein-DNA interactions that regulate both tissue-shared and tissue-specific functions. With this goal in mind, we identified the positions in the fly genome that are bound by Yki, Sd, and Hth in the progenitors of the wing and eye-antenna structures of the fly. These data not only provide a global view of the Yki gene regulatory network, they reveal an unusual amount of tissue specificity in the genomic regions targeted by Sd and Hth, but not Yki. The data also reveal that tissue-specific binding is very likely to overlap tissue-specific enhancer regions, provide important clues for how tissue-specific Sd and Hth binding occurs, and support the idea that gene regulatory networks are plastic, with spatial differences in binding significantly impacting network structures.
