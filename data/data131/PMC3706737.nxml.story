This study investigated whether weekly teriparatide (TPTD) injections are as effective as daily teriparatide injections for the treatment of stage 3 bisphosphonate-related osteonecrosis of the jaws (BRONJ) and compared serum markers of bone turnover between the two treatment regimens. Daily TPTD treatment has recently been reported to be effective for BRONJ, but there are no reports describing the effectiveness of weekly TPTD injections. We report two patients with stage 3 BRONJ. One patient was successfully treated with weekly TPTD injections and the other with daily TPTD injections. Changes in the levels of serum N-telopeptide of type I collagen (s-NTX) and serum N-terminal propeptide of type I collagen (P1NP) were studied. Two patients with stage 3 BRONJ that was refractory to conservative treatment were treated with TPTD. Their medical records were reviewed and the patients were interviewed. There was complete mucosal coverage of the intraoral defects after 3 months of TPTD treatment in both patients. Progressive bone regeneration in an area of mandibular fracture was identified after 4 months of treatment. The s-NTX level increased slightly in both patients. This is the first report of successful treatment of stage 3 BRONJ with weekly TPTD injections. Either daily or weekly TPTD injections may effectively treat stage 3 BRONJ and should be considered before or perhaps even in lieu of undertaking major resection and reconstruction.
