B7-H6, a new member of B7-family ligand, also known as NCR3LG1, plays an important role in NK cells mediated immune responses. Many studies have shown that it is highly expressed in various human cancers, and its expression levels are significantly associated with cancer patientsâ€™ clinicopathological parameters and postoperative prognoses. But, still the exact role of B7-H6 expression in human glioma remains elusive. In the present study, we have characterized the B7-H6 expression in the human glioma tissues as well as glioma cell lines, U87 and U251. We observed that B7-H6 was highly expressed in the human glioma tissues, and its expression was significantly associated with cancer progression. By using the RNA interference technology, we successfully ablated B7-H6 expression in human glioma cell lines to further study its contribution towards various biological features of this malignancy. Our study identified that the B7-H6 knockdown in U87 and U251 glioma cells significantly suppressed cell proliferation, migration, invasion, and enhanced apoptosis along with induction of cell cycle arrest. It thus suggested that B7-H6 play an important role in the regulation of the biological behavior of these glioma cells. However, the detailed mechanism of B7-H6 mediated regulation of glioma cancer cell transformation and its prognostic value merits further investigation.
