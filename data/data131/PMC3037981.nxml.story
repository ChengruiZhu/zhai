Bochdalek hernias (BHs) arise due to congenital diaphragmatic defect and can result in gross displacement of abdominal tissues into the thorax. Although they are uncommon in occurrence, they usually present as serious respiratory distress in infants. In the adult population, they are asymptomatic and only detected incidentally. In this report, we present the case of a 26-year-old male who acutely presented with severe epigastric pain radiating to the back and deranged vital signs as a result of incorrect previous diagnoses. A large left diaphragmatic hernia containing his pancreatic tail, spleen, stomach and other intra-abdominal organs was confirmed by CT scan, together occupying a third of the hemithorax. Although not common, diagnostics of BHs should be considered in patients presenting with acute abdomen. A plain chest X-ray displaying diminished left diaphragmatic outline or signs of mediastinal shift should raise suspicion. Previous normal chest X-ray can be deceptive and does not rule out a diaphragmatic hernia. Herein, we also review the literature for previously reported acute presentation of 11 similar cases in adults and highlight the value of including BH as one of the differential diagnoses.
