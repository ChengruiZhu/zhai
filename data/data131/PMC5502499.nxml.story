Laryngeal fracture is a rare condition with potential life-long implications related to airway patency, voice quality, and swallowing. Rarity of the condition leads to lack of consensus on the most suitable way to manage this injury. The mode of injury can be prevented by strict legislation on the roads. We report a case of a 28-year-old Indian male who sustained a comminuted displaced fracture of the thyroid cartilage with disruption of anterior commissure due to blunt trauma caused by the metallic side rod of a ladder projecting from the rear of a vehicle in front of the bike on which he was riding. He presented with breathing difficulty, change in voice, surgical emphysema, and pneumomediastinum, but without any skin changes over the neck. His airway could be restored due to early tracheostomy and open reduction with internal fixation with sutures along with laryngeal stenting. He has no significant swallowing or breathing problem and reasonably good voice 6 months after surgery. This case highlights the need for strict legislation on roads in India and the importance of high level of suspicion for laryngeal fracture in acute trauma patient. Early identification and timely internal fixation not only restore the airway but also improve long-term voice and airway outcomes.
