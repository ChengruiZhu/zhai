Metabolism is the process of converting nutrients into usable energy and the building blocks of cellular structures. Although the biochemical reactions of metabolism are well characterized, the ways in which metabolism is regulated and regulates other biological processes remain incompletely understood. In particular, the extent to which metabolite concentrations are related to the production of gene products is an open question. To address this question, we have measured the dynamics of both metabolites and gene products in yeast in response to two different environmental stresses. We find a strong coordination of the responses of metabolites and functionally related gene products. The nature of this correlation (e.g., whether it is direct or inverse) depends on the type of metabolite (e.g., amino acid versus glycolytic compound) and the kind of stress to which the cells were subjected. We have used our observations of these dependencies to design a Bayesian algorithm that predicts functional relationships between metabolites and genes directly from experimental data. This approach lays the groundwork for a systems-level understanding of metabolism and its regulation by (and of) gene product levels. Such an understanding would be valuable for metabolic engineering and for understanding and treating metabolic diseases.
