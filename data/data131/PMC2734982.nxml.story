In humans, as in most sexually reproducing organisms, recombination plays a fundamental role in meiosis, helping to align chromosomes and to ensure their proper segregation. Recombination events are tightly regulated both in terms of their minimum number (the rule of “crossover assurance”) and placement (due to “crossover interference”). Accumulating evidence, however, suggests that recombination patterns are highly variable among humans, raising numerous questions about the nature and stringency of crossover assurance and interference. We took a first step towards answering these questions by examining patterns of recombination in gametes inherited by viable, non-trisomic offspring. We found that the minimum number of crossovers is tightly regulated at the level of a chromosome (rather than chromosome arm), but with a notable exception: in females, chromosome 21 appears to frequently segregate properly in the absence of a crossover. We also found a set of double recombination events in surprisingly close proximity, consistent with a pathway not subject to crossover interference. These findings suggest that there are multiple mechanisms of recombination in human meiosis, which may buffer the effects of inter-individual variation in rates.
