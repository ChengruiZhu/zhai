Networks of neurons display a broad variety of behavior that nonetheless can often be described in very simple statistical terms. Here we explain the basis of one particularly striking statistical rule: that in many systems, the likelihood that groups of neurons burst, or fire together, is linked to the number of neurons involved, or size of the burst, by a power law. The wide-spread presence of these so-called avalanches has been taken to mean that neuronal networks in general operate near criticality, the boundary between two different global behaviors. We model these neuronal avalanches within the context of a network of noisy excitatory and inhibitory neurons interconnected by several different connection rules. We find that neuronal avalanches arise in our model only when excitatory and inhibitory connections are balanced in such a way that small fluctuations in the difference of population activities feed forward into large fluctuations in the sum of activities, creating avalanches. In contrast with the notion that the ubiquity of neuronal avalanches implies that neuronal networks operate near criticality, our work shows that avalanches are ubiquitous because they arise naturally from a network structure, the noisy balanced network, which underlies a wide variety of models.
