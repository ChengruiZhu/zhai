Morbidity and mortality from cardiovascular diseases are still high, even with the use of the best available therapies. There is mounting evidence that excessive renin-angiotensin system activation triggers much of the damaging and progressive nature of cardiovascular and kidney diseases through expression of angiotensin II. Moreover, angiotensin II play a major role in the development of end organ damage through a variety of inflammatory mechanisms. Today, angiotensins-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor antagonists have clearly demonstrated their efficacy in preventing target organ damage and in reducing cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in ischemic heart disease (IHD). Moreover, the development of angiotensin II receptor antagonists has enabled a large gain in tolerability and safety. Several clinical trials have firmly established that these drugs act on the reninâ€“angiotensin system, reducing the incidence of coronary events with monotherapy and combination therapy. In this review we summarize the role mono- and combined therapy of ACE inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor antagonists play in ischemic heart disease. In this respect the review will improve ideas for developing new formulations with combinations of these drugs in the future.
