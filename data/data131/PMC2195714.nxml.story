P-selectin glycoprotein ligand 1 (PSGL-1) is a mucin-like selectin counterreceptor that binds to P-selectin, E-selectin, and L-selectin. To determine its physiological role in cell adhesion as a mediator of leukocyte rolling and migration during inflammation, we prepared mice genetically deficient in PSGL-1 by targeted disruption of the PSGL-1 gene. The homozygous PSGL-1–deficient mouse was viable and fertile. The blood neutrophil count was modestly elevated. There was no evidence of spontaneous development of skin ulcerations or infections. Leukocyte infiltration in the chemical peritonitis model was significantly delayed. Leukocyte rolling in vivo, studied by intravital microscopy in postcapillary venules of the cremaster muscle, was markedly decreased 30 min after trauma in the PSGL-1–deficient mouse. In contrast, leukocyte rolling 2 h after tumor necrosis factor α stimulation was only modestly reduced, but blocking antibodies to E-selectin infused into the PSGL-1–deficient mouse almost completely eliminated leukocyte rolling. These results indicate that PSGL-1 is required for the early inflammatory responses but not for E-selectin–mediated responses. These kinetics are consistent with a model in which PSGL-1 is the predominant neutrophil P-selectin ligand but is not a required counterreceptor for E-selectin under in vivo physiological conditions.
