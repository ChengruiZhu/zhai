The aim of the present study was to investigate the levels of circulating CD14 in relation to the expression of tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) in monocytes, and serum levels of TNF-α and macrophage inflammatory protein-1 (MIP-1) in migraine patients. Numerous studies revealed controversial changes in the components of the immune system during attacks and the interictal period in migraine patients. Our study included 40 migraineurs and 39 controls. The levels of TNF-α, MIP-1 and CD14 were measured in peripheral monocytes and in sera with the Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA) method, and the monocyte expression of TNF-α was also analysed by immunostaining. Serum CD14 concentrations were higher and the expression of TNF-α in monocytes was decreased in migraineurs. The serum MIP-1 level correlated with Verbal Rating Scale (VRS); the MIP-1:CD14 ratio in monocytes correlated with Visual Analogue Scale (VAS); the MIP-1:CD14 ratio correlated with Migraine Severity (MIGSEV)-Pain scores; and serum CD14 concentration correlated with migraine duration in years. Increased serum CD14 and depletion of TNF-α in monocytes can orchestrate other components of the immune system during the interictal period.
