 of the genome. As nucleosome positioning profoundly affects DNA accessibility to other DNA binding proteins such as transcription factors (TFs), it plays an important role in transcription regulation. However, to what extent nucleosome positioning is guided by intrinsic DNA sequence preferences of nucleosomes, and to what extent other DNA binding factors play a role, is currently highly debated. Here we use a rigorous biophysical model to systematically study the relative contributions of intrinsic sequence preferences and competitive binding of TFs to nucleosome positioning in yeast. We find that, on the one hand, the phasing of the many small spacers within dense nucleosome arrays that cover gene bodies are mainly determined by intrinsic sequence preferences. On the other hand, larger nucleosome free regions (NFRs) in promoters are explained predominantly by TF binding. Strikingly, we find that only 10â€“20 TFs make a significant contribution to explaining NFRs, and these TFs are highly enriched for directly interacting with chromatin modifiers. Thus, the picture that emerges is that binding by a specific class of TFs recruits chromatin modifiers which mediate local nucleosome expulsion.
