A remarkable ability of the human brain is that it can mentally replay past episodes. For instance, if one remembers the last movie one has seen, one can vividly evoke parts of this event in a temporally highly structured manner. This implicates a neural mechanism that temporally guides the brain through memory retrieval as a sensory trace unfolds over time. However, those mechanisms are weakly understood, because little is known about the temporal dynamics of memory replay. Using a new analysis method, we detect the replay of temporal patterns in a memory task that requires participants to mentally replay short sound or video clips. We show that the phase of a low-frequency oscillation carries a temporal signature that is unique to specific stimulus content (either visual or auditory) and signifies its replay in memory. Importantly, the replay of temporal signatures is localized in processing regions specific for each sensory modality and is related to decreases in low-frequency power in the same regions. Our study provides first insight that our brain codes information of dynamic stimuli in the phase of low-frequency neural time series and that these time series can be replayed purely from episodic memory.
