Ovarian small-cell carcinoma hypercalcemic type (OSCCHT) is a relatively rare and highly fatal gynecological malignancy. Prognosis is generally poor, and no treatment guidelines are offered. Here, we report a case of OSCCHT successfully treated by complete excision and a postoperative chemotherapy scheme of carboplatin and paclitaxel. A 29-year-old female with with pelvic mass and significantly increased serum calcium (4.90 mmol/L) was referred to our hospital on August 22, 2013. Abdominal ultrasonography and computed tomography revealed a pelvic nonhomogeneous echo of a 113Ã—102 mm mass, possibly coming from the adnexa of the uterus. Preoperative examinations indicated high levels of serum calcium and relevant acute renal dysfunction; hence, continuous renal replacement therapy was performed until all tests reached minimum operation requirements. Interestingly, after excision, serum calcium levels decreased rapidly and therefore, extra calcium had to be taken in order to take the level back up to normal. The patient was diagnosed with OSCCHT based on the clinical data and pathological examinations. After six cycles of chemotherapy, the patient was in a good condition and on follow-up there were no signs of recurrence.
