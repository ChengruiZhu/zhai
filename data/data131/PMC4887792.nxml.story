The present study reports the case of a 42-year-old male with multiple myeloma (MM)-associated skin light chain amyloidosis who presented with skin purpura as the initial symptom, which was misdiagnosis as Henoch-Schönlein purpura nephritis prior to admission to the Second Xiangya Hospital (Changsha, Hunan, China). The patient presented with purpura, papules petechiae and spontaneous ecchymosis, which was located scattered around the neck, chest and limbs, accompanied by a small amount of bleeding in the conjunctival and oral mucosa, and a swollen tongue. Upon laboratory examination, the serum immunological change showed increased serum immunoglobulin G and λ light chain levels, and a urine Bence Jones protein level of >1 g/24 h. This was accompanied with an abnormal result for immunofixation electrophoresis, and positive staining with Congo red showing apple-green birefringence in skin biopsy specimens. Thus, the patient was diagnosed with MM-associated skin amyloidosis with the initial symptom of skin purpura. Following treatment with chemotherapy consisting of prednisone and bortezomib, the skin lesions markedly improved. The present study indicates that the presentation of skin purpura in systemic amyloidosis associated with MM may be an important aid in the diagnosis and direct treatment of this disease in the clinic.
