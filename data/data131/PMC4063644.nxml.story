Peripheral T-cell lymphomas (PTCLs) account for 12% of non-Hodgkinâ€™s lymphomas (NHLs). Immunoglobulin (Ig) A pemphigus is an autoimmune blistering disease characterized by tissue-bound and circulating IgA antibodies that target epidermal cell surface components. Malignant lymphomas are often linked with autoimmune disease and the autoimmune blistering disease, paraneoplastic pemphigus, has been associated with NHL. However, cases of PTCLs that are complicated by IgA pemphigus are particularly rare. The current study presents the first known case of PTCL complicated by IgA pemphigus. A 43-year-old male was admitted to the Union Hospital (Wuhan, China) in March 2012 with multiple swollen lymph nodes. Pathology examinations revealed PTCL. Immunohistochemical staining was positive for cluster of differentiation (CD)2, CD3, CD5, CD7 and CD47, and negative for CD20. Ki-67 was ~40% positive. The patient was treated with four cycles of cyclophosphamide, Adriamycin, vincristine and prednisone, and two cycles of gemcitabine, cisplatin and dexamethasone; in addition, the patient received radiation of the retroperitoneal region (total dose, 36 Gy). The patient underwent thalidomide maintenance therapy for 20 days before flaccid blisters appeared on the trunk and limbs. Histopathology and immunofluorescence indicated IgA pemphigus, and intravenous methylprednisolone was administered, followed by treatment with prednisone. Subsequently, no evidence of recurrent lymphoma or pemphigus has been observed.
