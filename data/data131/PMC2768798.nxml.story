 mouse, in which the growth of luciferase-transduced MM cells was visualized using noninvasive bioluminescence imaging (BLI). This model appeared well suited to study disease progression and response to therapy by identifying the location of various foci of MM tumor growth scattered throughout the skeleton and at subsequent time points the quantitative assessment of the tumor load by using BLI. We report here on the corresponding high-resolution X-ray micro-computed tomographic (micro-CT) analysis to study skeletal defects in the mice with full-blown MM. Several anatomical derangements were observed, including abnormalities in geometry and morphology, asymmetrical bone structures, decreased overall density in the remaining bone, loss of trabecular bone mass, destruction of the inner microarchitecture, as well as cortical perforations. Using the combination of BLI, micro-CT imaging, and immune-histopathological techniques, we found a high correlation between the micro-CT-identified lesions, exact tumor location, and infiltration leading to structural lesions and local bone deformation. This confirms that this animal model strongly resembles human MM and has the potential for studying the biology of MM growth and for preclinical testing of novel therapies for MM and for repair of MM-induced bone lesions.
