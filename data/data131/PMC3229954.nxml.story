CD20 positive T cell lymphoma is a rare condition that is associated with the coexpressions of CD20 and T cell markers, such as, CD3, CD5, or UCHL-1. Positivity for CD20 in this tumor represents an aberrant immunophenotype, but the presence of monoclonal T cell receptor (TCR) gene rearrangements and negativity for immunoglobulin heavy chain gene rearrangement indicate that this tumor is a T cell lymphoma. The majority of cases of CD20 positive T cell lymphoma have been reported as immature peripheral T cell lymphoma not otherwise specified. However, we believe that this disease is likely to be re-listed as a new disease entity after its pathogenesis has been elucidated and more cases have been evaluated. Here, we present a case of peripheral T cell lymphoma coexpressing CD20 and T cell markers with a demonstrable TCR gene rearrangement, in a patient who had been misdiagnosed as having B cell type lymphoma 4 years previously. We hypothesize that in this case initially circulating normal CD20+ T cell subsets underwent neoplastic transformation and CD20 positive T cell lymphoma subsequently developed in the lymph node, and then recurred in the skin due to systemic disease or metastasized from the nodal disease.
