Cells respond to many environmental cues through the activity of cell surface receptor proteins, which sense these cues and convey that information to signaling molecules inside the cell. G-proteinâ€“coupled receptors (GPCRs) form the largest eukaryotic family of plasma membrane receptors. They convert the information provided by extracellular stimuli into intracellular second messengers, like cyclic AMP (cAMP). After prolonged stimulation, they are internalized inside cells, an event that to date has been thought to terminate the production of second messengers. Though many of the key steps of GPCR signaling are known in detail, precisely how signaling and termination actually occur in time and space (i.e., in subcellular compartments or microdomains) is still largely unexplored. To observe GPCR signaling in living cells, we generated mice expressing a fluorescent sensor that allows monitoring the intracellular levels of cAMP with a microscope. We utilized this system to study, directly in native thyroid follicles, the signal sent by the receptor for thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH). Our findings indicate that TSH receptors are internalized rapidly after activation but continue to stimulate cAMP production inside cells and that this sustained, cAMP production is apparently required for localized activation of downstream components. These data challenge the current model of the GPCR-cAMP pathway by suggesting the existence of previously unrecognized intracellular site(s) for cAMP generation and of differential signaling outcomes as a result of intracellular GPCR signaling. Such intracellular site(s) may provide specialized signaling platforms, thus contributing to the spatiotemporal regulation of cAMP production and to signaling specificity within the GPCR family.
