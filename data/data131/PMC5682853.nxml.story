To quantify myocardial edema by using a T2 relaxometry approach with a dual-contrast turbo spin-echo (dcTSE) sequence in patients with acute myocarditis regarding focal late gadolinium enhancement (LGE) burden. CMR T2 relaxometry was performed in 39 patients (age 41 ± 19 years; 36% women) with LGE in a typical myocarditis pattern and in ten healthy volunteers (age 46 ± 12; 60% woman). dcTSE sequence (echo time 29 and 75 ms, respectively) was used for T2 mapping, analysis were performed on the basis of region of interest (ROI). Myocardial T2 relaxation times (T2 RT) in patients-ROI with focal LGE were significantly (p < 0.001) higher than T2 RT in patients—ROI without apparent LGE pattern (65 ms (IQR 36–95) vs. 60 ms (IQR 26–88), respectively). T2 RT in healthy volunteers [55 ms (IQR 35–71)] were significantly lower than in patients ROI with or without focal LGE-pattern (p < 0.001, respectively). T2 RT assessed by dcTSE are significantly higher in patients segments with and without focal LGE compared to normal controls, supporting a global myocardial inflammatory process in acute myocarditis. Furthermore, this quantitative T2-mapping approach highlights the potential to identify patients with diffuse myocarditis.
