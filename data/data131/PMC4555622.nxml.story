This study better defines the anatomy of the proximal shoulder in relationship to the long head of the BT. Using our surgical techniques and recommendations, both arthroscopic and open tenodesis procedures adequately restored the native length-tension relationship of the long head of the biceps. Surgical recommendations are as follows: For arthroscopic suprapectoral tenodesis with tenodesis screws, the anatomic landmark of the SBG should be used. The tendon resection length should be approximately 1 cm in males and 5 mm in females when using a 25-mm tunnel. For subpectoral tenodesis, the site of tenodesis should be placed approximately 3 cm above the inferior border of the pectoralis major tendon in the bicipital groove; whipstitching and preserving approximately 2 cm of the biceps tendon above the MTJ is also recommended. The diameter of the screws in either location should be based on patient anatomy. However, this study shows the need for slightly longer screws for the subpectoral tenodesis, as the average hole depth was 20.5 mm. The system used in this study has 7 × 10–mm and 8 × 12–mm screws available. Based on study findings, a screw length of 15 to 18 mm may be needed.
