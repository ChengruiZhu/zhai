Dental enamel is a unique, highly mineralized tissue of ectodermal origin. It is characterized by lack of metabolic activity once formed, implying that disturbances during development can manifest as permanent defects in the erupted tooth. Although the etiology of enamel defects may be attributed to local, systemic, genetic, or environmental factors, most are likely to be multifactorial in nature. The time frame of exposure and the mechanism underpinning the causative factors determine the presentation of these defects. These developmental defects of enamel (DDE) may range from slight abnormalities of the tooth's color to a complete absence of the enamel, some of which may be sensed by an individual as being disfiguring and call for treatment to improve the appearance of the dentition. Molar incisor hypomineralization (MIH) is a relatively common condition that varies in clinical severity, remains localized to permanent incisors and first permanent molars, and whose prevalence varies between 2.8 and 25% depending upon the study. Adhesion and retention of resin restorations is challenging in long-term rehabilitation in these cases. This paper presents a novel approach in the functional and esthetic rehabilitation of a 13-year-old female child diagnosed with multiple DDEs.
