Stress can impair the ability of individuals to select actions based on their consequences, promoting instead the acquisition of habits—automatic behaviors that are insensitive to action–outcome relationships. Stress in adolescence can have particularly long-lasting consequences, affecting behavior and mood regulation even in adulthood. Here, we show that adolescent mice exposed to a stress hormone developed biases towards habits and amotivation (a symptom of depression) in adulthood. We investigated the role of the stress-sensitive tyrosine kinase receptor B (trkB) receptor, a protein that regulates synaptic strength and plasticity in the mammalian nervous system. This receptor was modified by adolescent experience throughout multiple brain regions, but the changes were particularly long lasting in the ventral hippocampus—a brain region involved in mood regulation. Experimentally reducing the activity of the receptor recapitulated the behavioral abnormalities induced by the stress hormone. Meanwhile, pharmacological stimulation of the receptor corrected these abnormalities and had long-lasting antidepressant-like effects that persisted even after drug treatment ended. Thus, pharmacological interventions that augment trkB activity may be particularly efficacious in treating neurobehavioral deficits in adolescents exposed to chronic stress.
