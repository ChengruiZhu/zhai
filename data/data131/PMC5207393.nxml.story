Research evidence show that thrombospondin-1 (TSP-1) is an anti-angiogenic protein which potently inhibits the downstream signaling of vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2 (VEGFR2), an important pathway that promotes endothelial cell proliferation, migration and permeability. As demonstrated by numerous studies, expression of TSP-1 is often upregulated in peripheral arterial disease (PAD) and downregulated in many solid tumors, primarily because of its inhibitory effect on angiogenesis and tumor growth. Given the established anti-angiogenic property of TSP-1 and its dysregulation in diseases, it holds great value to design novel therapeutic strategies that aim to restore TSP-1 expression in tumors and limit its expression in PAD by regulating the biomolecules that control TSP-1 synthesis. The computational, mechanistic, experiment-based model of TSP-1 intracellular regulation presented here is a solid integration of the current knowledge and is substantially validated against published data. Our model simulations reproduce the experimental time-course dynamics of key proteins within the regulatory network and suggest interesting behavior in hypoxia- and cytokine-driven regulation of TSP-1. In addition, we assess different model-based strategies to modulate TSP-1 synthesis
