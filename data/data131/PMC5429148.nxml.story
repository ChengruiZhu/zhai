Acute drug-induced dystonia is commonly associated with antipsychotic drugs, antidepressants, antiemetics, and other medications. Bupropion (Wellbutrin and Zyban) is one of the most frequently prescribed antidepressants in the United States and Canada and smoking cessation aid. However, only few reported cases have been published of acute dystonia including dystonia after discontinuation of bupropion and even after a single dose of bupropion. Here, we report another case concerning an acute dystonia resulting from bupropion after dose escalation. To further assess this association, we used the Naranjo nomogram, which is a questionnaire designed for determining the likelihood of whether an adverse drug reaction is actually due to the drug rather than the result of other factors. Our patient’s total score was seven, suggesting that our patient had probable adverse drug reaction. In summary, our case is that selected patients may experience dose-related acute dystonia as adverse reactions to bupropion sustained release (SR). Since it is one of the most commonly prescribed antidepressants and smoking cessation aids, clinicians should be aware of the potential dystonia associated with bupropion.
