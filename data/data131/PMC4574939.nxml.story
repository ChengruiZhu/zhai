Many mathematical models that have been developed for biological systems are limited because the complex systems are not well understood, the parameters are not known, and available data is limited and noisy. On the other hand, experiments to support model development are limited in terms of costs and time, feasible inputs and feasible measurements. MBDOE combines the mathematical models with experiment design to strategically design optimal experiments to obtain data that will contribute to the understanding of the systems. Our approach extends current capabilities of existing MBDOE techniques to make them more useful for scientists to resolve the trajectories of the system under study. It identifies the optimal conditions for stimuli and measurements that yield the most information about the system given the practical limitations. Exploration of the input space is not a trivial extension to MBDOE methods used for determining optimal measurements due to the nonlinear nature of many biological system models. The exploration of the system dynamics elicited by different inputs requires a computationally efficient and tractable approach. Our approach plans optimal experiments to reduce dynamical uncertainty in the output of selected target states of the biological system.
