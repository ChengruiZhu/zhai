A total of 49 patients were identified with a mean age of 13.5 years (range 7-17). The majority were male (88%) and had a Salter-Harris III fracture (84%) involving the medial femoral condyle (88%). Greater than 90% of the injuries were the result of a contact injury and 50% occurred while playing football. The initial diagnosis was missed in 36% of cases. Advanced imaging revealed more displacement than plain radiographs (6 mm vs. 3 mm, respectfully p=0.007). Concomitant ACL and meniscus injuries were present in 12% of patients. All patients underwent surgical fixation with 59% utilizing an arthrotomy, 29% utilizing a percutaneous technique, and 12% using arthroscopic assistance. At a mean follow up of 2 years, all patients had returned to sport and all had “good to excellent” results. A leg length discrepancy was identified in 14% (mean 17 mm) and an angular deformity was identified in 8% (2 varus/2 valgus). 12% of patients required a second procedure for their resultant leg length discrepancy or angular deformity. Complications were more common in patients with open growth plates, patients with fractures involving the lateral femoral condyle, and patients that were casted (p<0.05).
