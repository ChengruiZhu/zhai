Retroviruses are RNA viruses that are reverse transcribed into DNA and inserted into the host's genome. Though this process happens most frequently in somatic cells (e.g., immune cells for HIV), retroviruses can occasionally be integrated in the genome of the host's germ cells. Such viral insertions may thus be transmitted vertically from parent to offspring, leading to the formation of “endogenous retroviruses.” A substantial fraction of mammalian genomes (about 8% in humans) corresponds to remnants of endogenous retroviruses integrated throughout evolution, providing a fossil record of past viral invasions and important clues on the history of modern retroviruses. In this study, we demonstrate that an endogenous retrovirus related to HIV and other lentiviruses was endogenized independently and quasi-simultaneously in two lineages of Malagasy lemurs around 4.2 million years ago. These are the first endogenous lentiviruses discovered in primates. Based on sequences collected from different lemur species, we reconstructed an apparently intact and complete sequence for this ancestral prosimian lentivirus, which will allow functional analysis and advance our understanding of the biology and origin of lentiviruses, including HIV. Furthermore, our study indicates that lentiviruses may still be circulating in lemurs and that a systematic screening of Malagasy mammals could further our knowledge on the past and present diversity of lentiviruses.
