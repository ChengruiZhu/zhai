Chemoresistance is often associated with other clinical characteristics such as enhanced migratory/invasive potential. However, the correlation and underlying molecular mechanisms remain unclear. The aim of this study was to elucidate the function of the miR-222-ABCG2 pathway in the correlation between cisplatin (DDP) resistance and enhanced cell migration/invasion in tongue squamous cell carcinoma (TSCC). Using TSCC cell lines and primary cultures from TSCC cases, we first confirmed the correlation among DDP resistance (measured by IC50 values and ABCG2/ERCC1 expression), migratory/invasive potential (assessed by migration/invasion assays) and miR-222 expression. In TSCC cells, siRNA-mediated ABCG2 knockdown led to enhanced DDP responsiveness and reduced migratory/invasive potential, whereas ABCG2 overexpression induced DDP resistance and enhanced cell migration/invasion. Luciferase assays revealed that ABCG2 is a direct target of miR-222. In addition to reducing cell migration/invasion, functional analyses in TSCC cells indicated that miR-222 can reduce expression of the ABCG2 gene and enhance DDP responsiveness. However, co-transfection with ABCG2 cDNA restored both DDP resistance and migration/invasion. Moreover, miR-222 mimics and ABCG2 siRNA inhibited tumor growth and lung metastasis
