Surgical glues have been used in pediatric surgery because of the fragility of tissue, and to prevent major surgeries. The present report describes our experience with using a new cyanoacrylate Glubran 2 (Viareggio, Italy) in the treatment of five cases of tracheoesophageal atresia with fistula (one fistula protection, three recurrent fistula, and one unstable patients), two cases of hypospadias, one case of vesicutanouse fistula after bladder extrophy, and one case of cloacal extrophy from Januaryâ€“December 2008. Three cases of recurrent tracheoesophageal atresia with fistula were treated by bronchoscpic glue injection. The other two cases benefited from glue through its ability to plug the fistula and to act as a protecting layer on anastomosis. In two cases with hypospadias excessive use of the glue caused skin necrosis, which was repaired. The wounds of cloacal extrophy were protected from nearby colostomy contamination and infection, and the vesicocutanouse fistula was closed by deepithelialization and sealing with glue. Based on the outcomes of the cases, it may be possible to suggest that Glubran 2 may be used safely in Pediatric Surgery as a sealant for the prevention and treatment of fistulas.
