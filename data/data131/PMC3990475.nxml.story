Cancer is a disease of random mutation and selection within the cellular genomes of an organism. As a result, when advanced disease is diagnosed, the cells comprising the tumour show a great amount of variability on the genomic level, a phenomenon termed intra-tumour genetic heterogeneity. Heterogeneity is thought to be one of the main reasons why tumors become resistant to therapy, and thus hinders personalised medicine approaches. If we want to understand tumour heterogeneity and its connection to resistance development we need to quantify it, which implies reconstructing the evolutionary history of cancer within the patient. Unfortunately, so far, methods for accurate reconstructions of these particular evolutionary trees and for quantification of heterogeneity have been missing. We here present MEDICC, a method that uses a minimum evolution criterion to compare cancer genomes based on genomic profiles of DNA content (copy-number profiles). It enables accurate reconstruction of the history of the disease and quantifies heterogeneity. It is specifically designed to deal with diploid human genomes, in that it disentangles genomic events on both parental alleles and includes a variety of accompanying algorithms to test for shapes of the evolutionary trees as well as the rate at which the cancer evolves.
