We measured baseline plasma levels of macrophage colony‐stimulating factor; monocyte chemotactic protein 1; C‐C motif chemokine ligands 3, 4, and 20; C‐X‐C motif chemokine ligands 1, 6, and 16; and C‐X3‐C motif chemokine ligand 1 in 292 participants who had a coronary event during follow‐up and 366 controls matched for age, sex, and time of inclusion who remained event free. Study participants were recruited from the Malmö Diet and Cancer Study population cohort and had no previous history of coronary artery disease. We found a strong independent negative association between macrophage colony‐stimulating factor and incident coronary events in a forward stepwise Cox proportional hazards model including all biomarkers alongside the classic Framingham risk factors (age, sex, smoking, total cholesterol, high‐density lipoprotein cholesterol, systolic blood pressure), diabetes mellitus, and medication. Conversely, monocyte chemotactic protein 1 had the strongest independent positive association with the outcome. The addition of macrophage colony‐stimulating factor and monocyte chemotactic protein 1 significantly improved the predictive ability of a model including traditional risk factors alone (C statistic 0.81 [95%
