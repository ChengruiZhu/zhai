Deregulated expression of microRNAs has the oncogenic or tumor suppressor function in cancer. Since miRNAs in plasma are highly stable, their quantification could contribute to more precise cancer diagnosis, prognosis and therapy prediction. We have quantified expression of seven oncomiRs, namely miR-17/92 cluster (miR-17, miR-18a, miR-19a and miR-20a), miR-21, miR-27a and miR-155, in plasma of 137 breast cancer (BC) patients. We detected down-regulation of six miRNAs in patients with invasive BC compared to controls; however, only miR-20a and miR-27a down-regulations were statistically significant. Comparing miRNA expression between early and advanced stages of BC, we observed statistically significant decrease of miR-17 and miR-19a. We identified down-regulation of miR-17 and miR-20a in patients with clinical parameters of advanced BC (lymph node metastasis, tumor grade 3, circulating tumor cells, higher Ki-67-related proliferation, hormone receptor negativity and HER2 amplification), when compared to controls. Moreover, decreased level of miR-17 was found from low to high grade. Therefore, miR-17 could represent an indicator of advanced BC. Down-regulated miR-27a expression levels were observed in all clinical categories regardless of tumor progression. Hence, miR-27a could be used as a potential diagnostic marker for BC. Our data indicates that any changes in miRNA expression levels in BC patients in comparison to controls could be highly useful for cancer-associated pathology discrimination. Moreover, dynamics of miRNA expression changes could be used for BC progression monitoring.
