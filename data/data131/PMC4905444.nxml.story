Endometriosis is a chronic estrogen-dependent disease that occurs in approximately 10% of reproductive age women. Baboons offer a clear benefit for studying the initiation and progression of endometriosis since baboon is very close to humans phylogenetically. Progestins are used in the treatment of endometriosis. The therapeutic window of progestins depends on the ratio of its affinity towards progesterone receptor agonism verses antagonism. The present study is to determine the role of pure antiprogestin in baboon endometriosis. We hypothesize that pure antiprogestin will induce unopposed estrogenicity and spontaneous endometriosis in baboons. The rate of endometrial invasion and attachment through modeled peritoneum in the presence and absence of progesterone and antiprogestin was evaluated in this study. A baboon model of endometriosis induced by unopposed estrogenicity using progesterone receptor antagonist (EC304) was used in this study. We observed EC304 has induced unopposed estrogenicity that deregulated proteins involved in attachment, invasion, cell growth, and steroid hormone receptors in this model. Our data suggest that depleting progesterone levels in the endometrium will increase estrogen hyper-responsiveness that leads to increased endometriotic lesion progression in the baboon (
