 proliferation restricts their use in the treatment of damaged tissues. Therefore, it is important to establish an alternative and safe source of MSCs. The objective of this study was to demonstrate induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) generation from a combination of an accessible source tissue and an integration-free method; we also attempted the differentiation of iPSCs into MSC-like cells (MSLCs) for future autologous tissue engineering. iPSCs were derived from human gingival tissues, which are easily accessible in the field of dentistry, via the use of non-integrating episomal plasmids. Established iPSCs expressed embryonic stem (ES) cell-specific markers, as assessed by gene analysis and immunocytochemistry. Embryoid bodies and teratoma formation were formed from iPSCs, showing their capacity to differentiate into three germ layers. Furthermore, we were successful in differentiating iPSCs into MSLCs. They tested positively for their capacity of trilineage differentiation. Our results demonstrate that human gingival integration-free iPSCs, readily accessible stem cells generated using episomal plasmid vectors, are a promising source of MSLCs, which can be used in tissue regeneration.
