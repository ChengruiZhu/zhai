Nucleosomes are fundamental units of chromatin folding consisting of double-stranded DNA wrapped ~1.7 times around a histone octamer. By densely populating the eukaryotic genome, nucleosomes enable efficient genome compaction inside the cellular nucleus. However, the portion of DNA occupied by a nucleosome can hardly be accessed by other DNA-binding proteins, obstructing fundamental cellular processes such as DNA replication and transcription. DNA compaction and access by other proteins can simultaneously be achieved via the dynamical repositioning of nucleosomes, which can slide along the DNA sequence. In this study, we developed and used coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations to reveal the molecular details of nucleosome sliding. We find that the sliding mode is highly dependent on the underlying DNA sequence. Specifically, a sequence with a strong nucleosome positioning signal slides via large jumps by five and ten base pairs, preserving the optimal DNA bending profile. On the other hand, uniform sequences without the positioning signal slide via a screw-like motion of DNA, one base pair at the time. These results show that sequence has a large effect not only on the formation of nucleosomes, but also on the kinetics of repositioning.
