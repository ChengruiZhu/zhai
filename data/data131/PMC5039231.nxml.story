The most correct analysis of the compositions of diverse analytes mixtures is significant for analytical studies in different fields; however, many prevalent analytes cannot be identified employing traditional partition gas chromatographic methods. Thus, the increasing requirements on analytes of isomeric compounds and the problems encountered in their separation demand a study of more diverse analytical systems which are characterised by higher selectivity. Therefore, the selectivity and polarities of various liquid crystals (rod-like, banana-shape, biforked, oxygen, sulphur, nitrogen, and metal containing molecules, Schiff-base, and polymeric dendrimers) employed as liquid crystalline stationary phases (LCSPs) have been discussed from both points of views, namely, their analytical applications and thermodynamic characteristics of infinitely diluted probes with different acceptor–donor properties. Extreme particular effort has been paid to the different interdependencies between the bound up chemical structures of liquid crystal molecules with their different acceptor–donor properties and the connected resolution capabilities in the interpretation of the probe—LCSP systems, on the basis of the
