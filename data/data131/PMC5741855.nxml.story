The treatment of severe tetracycline discoloration is a challenge for the dentist. There are several treatment options and one of the most effective is the use of feldspathic veneers. The aim of this clinical case was to carry out the replacement with conventional feldspathic ceramic veneers on a patient with highly stained teeth (grade IV tetracycline) by a minimally invasive approach. Clinical examination revealed gingival retraction, color change of the veneers, ceramic cracked of 1.1 and 1.3 and incisal wear in lower anterior teeth. The decision was to retreat with feldspathic ceramic veneers from 1.6 to 2.6. Premolars and first molars were included because its dark color intensifies the width buccal corridors. Also, the restoration with veneers from 3.3 to 4.3 was considered. Firstly, the veneers were removed and the color was selected by the Vitapan 3D Master guide (Vita Zahnfabrick, Bad Säckingen, Germany). Mock-up was made to evaluate aesthetic, phonetic and functional parameters. Then, teeth were prepared through the mock-up in order to reduce the minimal amount of dental tissue possible. Opaque dentine mass of microhybrid composite (Esthet-X A2O, Dentsply Sirona, Konstanz, Germany) was placed to mask the most intense stains. The definitive impressions were taken with silicone (Aquasil Ultra XLV, Dentsply Sirona, Konstanz, Germany) were taken to fabricate conventional feldsphatic ceramic veneers (Noritake kisai Co, Ltd. Japan) by the parallel stratification masking technique. For cementing, an opaque cement was selected from the try-in tests (Calibra, Dentsply Sirona, Konstanz, Germany) and the composite was silicatized with an air-abrasion device. A favorable and minimally invasive result was achieved to treat grade IV tetracycline stains, surpassing the patient’s aesthetic expectations and functional needs.
