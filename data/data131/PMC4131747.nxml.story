Retinal ganglion cell (RGC) loss in glaucoma is sectorial in nature and preceded by deficits in axonal transport. Neuroinflammation plays an important role in the pathophysiology of glaucoma in the retina, optic nerve and visual centers of the brain, where it similarly appears to be regulated spatially. In a murine model, we examined the spatial characteristics of astrocyte reactivity (migration/proliferation, hypertrophy and GFAP expression) in healthy retina, retina with two glaucoma-related risk factors (aging and genetic predisposition) and glaucomatous retina and established relationships between these reactivity indices and the spatial organization of astrocytes as well as RGC health. Astrocyte reactivity was quantified by morphological techniques and RGC health was determined by uptake and transport of the neural tracer cholera toxin beta subunit (CTB). We found that: (1) astrocyte reactivity occurs in microdomains throughout glaucomatous retina as well as retina with risk factors for glaucoma, (2) these astrocyte microdomains are primarily differentiated by the degree of retinal area covered by the astrocytes within them and (3) percent retinal area covered by astrocytes is highly predictive of RGC health. Our findings suggest that microdomains of astrocyte reactivity are biomarkers for functional decline of RGCs. Based on current and emerging imaging technologies, diagnostic assessment of astrocytes in the nerve fiber layer could succeed in translating axonal transport deficits to a feasible clinical application.
