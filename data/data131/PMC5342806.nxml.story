Several promising targeted-therapeutics for prostate cancer (PCa), primarily affecting the androgen receptor (AR) and the PI3K/AKT/mTOR-pathway, are in various phases of development. However, despite promise, single-agent inhibitors targeting the two pathways have not shown long-term benefits, perhaps due to a complex compensatory cross talk that exists between the two pathways. Combination therapy has thus been proposed to maximize benefit. We have carried out a systematic study of two-drug combination effect of MDV3100 (AR antagonist), BKM120 (PI3K inhibitor), TKI258 (pan RTK inhibitor) and RAD001 (mTOR inhibitor) using various PCa cell lines. We observed strong synergy when AR-positive cells are treated with MDV3100 in combination with any one of the PI3K-pathway inhibitors: TKI258, BKM120, or RAD001. Growth curve based synergy determination combined with Western blot analysis suggested MDV3100+BKM120 to be the most effective in inducing cell death in such conditions. In the case of dual targeting of the PI3K-pathway BKM120+TKI258 combination displayed exquisite sensitivity in all the 5 cell lines tested irrespective of androgen sensitivity, (LNCaP, VCaP, 22Rv1, PC3 and Du145). The effect of blockade with BKM120+TKI258 in PC3 cells was similar to a combination of BKM120 with chemotherapy drug cabazitaxel.
