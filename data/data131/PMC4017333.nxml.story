With an increasing number of primary hip replacements being performed every year, the burden of revision hip arthroplasty, for septic and aseptic loosening, recurrent dislocation or periprosthetic fracture, is also increasing. In recent years, different approaches to revising the femoral prosthesis have emerged; including both cemented and cementless techniques. With a stable cement mantle and good bone quality, or through the use of impaction bone grafting when bone stock is lacking, it is possible to re-cement a femoral prosthesis. Alternatively, a cementless modular femoral prosthesis may be used, providing the surgeon with further options for restoring leg length, hip offset, anteversion and stability. Studies evaluating the use of modular cementless prostheses have so far been limited to midterm studies, with results comparable to primary hip arthroplasty. There are some concerns, however, regarding tribological complications such as stem fracture, corrosion, and failure, and long-term studies are required to further evaluate these concerns. This review outlines the current evidence for the use of both cemented and cementless modular femoral prostheses in the setting of revision hip arthroplasty. Results of prospective and retrospective studies will be outlined, along with results obtained from national joint registries.
