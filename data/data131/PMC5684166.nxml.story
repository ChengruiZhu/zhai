Surgical revascularization is performed to preserve limb and to maintain functional status of patients with critical limb ischemia (CLI). The PREVENT III risk score helps to predict the postoperative course of CLI. However, this score is not available to estimate the risk of amputation or death properly in patients with hemodialysis (HD) and tissue loss (HD: 4 points, Tissue loss: 3 points), because they are classified as a high-risk group. Therefore, we investigated 213 patients with revascularized HD for CLI and proposed prognosis amputation or death for patients with HD risk score (PAD for HD risk score). PAD for HD risk score (non-ambulation: 3 points, ulcer/gangrene: 2 points, GNRI<92: 2 points, CRP>0.3 mg/dl: 1 point, Age≥75: 1 point) is more accurate for the prediction of amputation or death than the PREVENT III risk score (area under the curve [AUC]: 0.79 [95% confidence interval: CI: 0.71–0.87], p<0.01 vs. AUC: 0.63 [95%CI: 0.56–0.71]). The patients were stratified into three groups by total score in ascending order. The rate of 1-year amputation-free survival and independent ambulatory status were significantly different among three groups. PAD for HD risk score is useful for rehabilitation planning in patients with HD and CLI. (This is a translation of J Jpn Coll Angiol 2016; 56: 85–91.)
