Cell proliferation depends on efficient replication of the genome. Bacteria typically have a single origin of replication on a circular chromosome. After replication initiation, two replisomes assemble at the origin and each copy one of the two arms of the chromosome until they reach the terminus. There have been conflicting reports about the subcellular positioning and putative co-localization of the two replication forks during this process. It has remained controversial whether the two replisomes remain relatively close to each other with the DNA being pulled through, or separate as they translocate along the DNA like a track. Existing studies have relied heavily on snapshot images and these experiments cannot unambiguously distinguish between these two models: i.e. two resolvable forks versus two pairs of co-localized forks. The ability of replication to re-initiate before cell division in bacterial cells further complicates the interpretation of these types of imaging studies. In this paper, we use a combination of snapshot imaging, time-lapse imaging, and quantitative analysis to measure the fraction of time forks are co-localized during each cell cycle. We find that the forks are co-localized for the majority (80%) of the replication cycle in two highly-divergent model organisms:
