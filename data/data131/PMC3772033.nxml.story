The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends including a health hygiene education component into school-based deworming programs to reduce intestinal worm re-infection in treated children; however, the effect of these types of educational interventions has not been adequately studied. In this study, we investigated the effect of a health hygiene education intervention within a deworming program targeting Grade 5 schoolchildren in BÃ©len, Peru, a highly worm-endemic area. Following baseline assessment, all children in 18 primary schools received deworming. Subsequently, nine schools were randomly assigned to receive a health hygiene educational intervention and nine were randomly assigned to not receive the educational intervention. Four months later, children from schools that received the educational intervention were found to be more knowledgeable about the transmission and prevention of intestinal worm infections and, although there was no observed effect on whipworms or hookworms, children were also significantly less likely to be infected with roundworms. These results support the WHO recommendation for the inclusion of health hygiene education into school-based deworming programs. The beneficial effects of deworming are likely to be enhanced when appropriate health hygiene education is integrated into the school curricula.
