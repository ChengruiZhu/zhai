Most respondents were regular (almost daily) users of the internet and considered themselves competent computer users. Over 80% of the patients used the portal at least once. More than half of them used the portal recently, i.e. the last month. Reasons for not using the portal were lack of actual health problems, problems with login procedures, too busy with other things. Related to regular care, most patients used the portal complementary to regular care for the same questions. However, about half of the patients stated that they used the portal as a substitution for regular consultations (face to face or telephone). On the other hand, one-third stated that they used the portal in addition to regular care. The users find the portal useful and easy to use. Almost all users visited the modules ‘medication overview and test results’ (92%) and ‘overview treatment appointments’ (82%). Also the modules ‘e-consult’ (58%) and ‘request for medical prescription’ (35%) were well attended. There were differences between patient groups. Adults with HIV evaluate the module ‘medication overview and test results’ as most important; parents of children with CF the module ‘e-consult’. Patient’s characteristics were not related to the use of the portal. Websites’ ease-to-use and overall appreciation of the portal were related to actual use. The results of the open questions show that patients appreciate the permanent (24/7) accessibility of the portal. They do not have to call several times to the hospital. Moreover, they do not have to feel troubled anymore to disturb their health care professionals for non urgent matters.
