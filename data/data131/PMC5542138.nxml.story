Eight hundred forty-three patients were included on this study, the average age was 31.7 years old, regarding gender, 468 females and 367 males. There was no difference in the sample characterization variables. Hips with small labrums were more likely to have a grade 3 or 4 chondral defect on the femoral head. First, comparing patients with 7 and 6 mm of labral thickness, patients measuring 6mm had an 1.7 relative risk for severe chondral damage on the FH [1.04 to 2.7] p=0.033. Second, when patients with 7 and 5 mm are compared, patients with 5mm of labral thickness have a 4.3 relative risk[2.2 to 4.3]p<0.001. Lastly, when the comparison between 7 and 4 mm is established, patients measuring 4mm have a relative risk 4.5 for severe chondral damage on the femoral head. No difference in the prevalence of chondral damage was found between patients measuring 7 and 8 mm. There was no difference in the prevalence of grade 3 and 4 defects on the acetabulum between the all the labrum measurements evaluated. Regarding the labral procedure performed, patients with 4mm of labral width in at least one point, 28% underwent labral reconstruction. On the other hand, in patients with 7, 6 and 5 mm of labral width, 98.6, 94.9 and 85.8% underwent labral repair, respectively.
