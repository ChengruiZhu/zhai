The final size of a developing organ is finely modulated by nutrient conditions through the activity of nutrient sensing pathways, and deregulation of these pathways is often causative of tumorigenesis. Besides the well-known roles of these pathways in inducing tissue and cell growth, here we identify a nonautonomous effect of activation of these pathways on growth and proliferation rates and on the final size of neighboring cell populations. We reveal that the observed autonomous and nonautonomous effects on tissue growth and proliferation rates rely on the up-regulation of the proteoglycan Dally, a major factor involved in modulating the spreading, stability, and activity of the growth promoting Decapentaplegic (Dpp)/transforming growth factor β(TGF-β) signaling molecule. Our data indicate that a reduction in the amount of available growth factors contributes to the outcompetition of wild-type cells by overgrowing cell populations. Whereas nutrient-sensing pathways modulate the final size of the adult structure according to nutrient availability to the feeding animal, Dpp plays an organ-intrinsic role in the coordination of growth and patterning. We identify the proteoglycan Dally as the rate-limiting factor that contributes to the tissue-autonomous and nonautonomous effects on growth caused by targeted activation of the nutrient-sensing pathways. Thus, our results unravel a role of Dally as a molecular bridge between the organ-intrinsic and organ-extrinsic mechanisms that regulate organ size.
