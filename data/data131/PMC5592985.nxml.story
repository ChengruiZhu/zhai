A total of 604 physiotherapists participated in the survey, out of which 385 respondents provided complete data. Nine participants were undergraduate physiotherapy students or not physiotherapists and their responses were excluded. The final number of participants included in data analysis was 376. The majority of the participants were men (60.4%) and most of them had completed their bachelor degree (66.2%). Although most physiotherapists reported a positive attitude towards the use of research in practice, there were many who were unfamiliar with the terms and implementation of EBP. The majority of physiotherapists had no formal EBP training (70.2%) in universities or any authorized training centres. According to the responses collected, the most important barrier to the implementation of EBP was insufficient teaching in previous education (43.1%), followed by lack of research knowledge and skills (36.4%). The study revealed that there was a significant association between physiotherapists’ attitude and their education level, while no significant associations were identified based on other demographic data. In addition, there were significant associations between physiotherapists’ awareness and knowledge and demographics such as education level, work setting, job title and previous training in EBP.
