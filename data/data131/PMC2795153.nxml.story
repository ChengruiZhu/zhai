Cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) imaging provides highly accurate measurements of biventricular volumes and mass and is frequently used in the follow-up of patients with acquired and congenital heart disease (CHD). Data on reproducibility are limited in patients with CHD, while measurements should be reproducible, since CMR imaging has a main contribution to decision making and timing of (re)interventions. The aim of this study was to assess intra-observer and interobserver variability of biventricular function, volumes and mass in a heterogeneous group of patients with CHD using CMR imaging. Thirty-five patients with CHD (7–62 years) were included in this study. A short axis set was acquired using a steady-state free precession pulse sequence. Intra-observer and interobserver variability was assessed for left ventricular (LV) and right ventricular (RV) volumes, function and mass by calculating the coefficient of variability. Intra-observer variability was between 2.9 and 6.8% and interobserver variability was between 3.9 and 10.2%. Overall, variations were smallest for biventricular end-diastolic volume and highest for biventricular end-systolic volume. Intra-observer and interobserver variability of biventricular parameters assessed by CMR imaging is good for a heterogeneous group of patients with CHD. CMR imaging is an accurate and reproducible method and should allow adequate assessment of changes in ventricular size and global ventricular function.
