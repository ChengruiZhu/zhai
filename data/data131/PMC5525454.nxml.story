Epithelial ovarian cancer is the most lethal gynecological cancer mainly due to late diagnosis, easy spreading and rapid development of chemoresistance. Cancer stem cells are considered to be one of the main mechanisms for chemoresistance, as well as metastasis and recurrent disease. To explore the stemness characteristics of ovarian cancer stem cells, we successfully enriched ovarian cancer stem-like cells from an established ovarian cancer cell line (SKOV-I6) and a fresh ovarian tumor-derived cell line (OVS1). These ovarian cancer stem-like cells possess important cancer stemness characteristics including sphere-forming and self-renewing abilities, expressing important ovarian cancer stem cell and epithelialâ€“mesenchymal transition markers, as well as increased drug resistance and potent tumorigenicity. Microarray analysis of OVS1-derived sphere cells revealed increased expression of amphiregulin (AREG) and decreased expression of its conserved regulatory microRNA, miR-34c-5p, when compared with the OVS1 parental cells. Overexpression of AREG and decreased miR-34c-5p expression in SKOV-I6 and OVS1 sphere cells were confirmed by quantitative real-time PCR analysis. Luciferase reporter assay and mutant analysis confirmed that AREG is a direct target of miR-34c-5p. Furthermore, AREG-mediated increase of sphere formation, drug resistance toward docetaxel and carboplatin, as well as tumorigenicity of SKOV-I6 and OVS1 cells could be abrogated by miR-34c-5p. We further demonstrated that miR-34c-5p inhibited ovarian cancer stemness through downregulation of the AREG-EGFR-ERK pathway. Overexpression of AREG was found to be correlated with advanced ovarian cancer stages and poor prognosis. Taken together, our data suggest that AREG promotes ovarian cancer stemness and drug resistance via the AREG-EGFR-ERK pathway and this is inhibited by miR-34c-5p. Targeting AREG, miR-34c-5p could be a potential strategy for anti-cancer-stem cell therapy in ovarian cancer.
