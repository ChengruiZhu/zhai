The multipotency and anti-inflammatory effects of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) make them attractive for cell therapy in regenerative medicine. A large number of MSCs is required for efficient therapy owing to the low homing efficiency of MSCs to target sites. Furthermore, owing to limitations in obtaining sufficient amounts of MSCs, in vitro expansion of MSCs that preserves their differentiation and proliferative potential is essential. The animal factor included in culture media also limits clinical application. In this study, adipose-derived MSCs showed a significantly higher proliferation rate in STK2, a chemically-defined medium, than in DMEM/FBS. The expression of MSC surface markers was increased in the culture using STK2 compared to that using DMEM/FBS. Tri-lineage differentiation analyses showed that MSCs cultured in STK2 were superior to those cultured in DMEM/FBS. In addition, MSCs cultured in STK2 showed a reduced senescence rate, small and homogenous cell size, and were more genetically stable compared to those cultured in DMEM/FBS. Furthermore, secretome analysis showed that the expression of factors related to proliferation/migration, anti-inflammation, and differentiation were increased in STK2 culture medium compared to DMEM/FBS. Taken together, these results suggest that culture using STK2 medium offers many advantages through which it is possible to obtain safer, superior, and larger numbers of MSCs.
