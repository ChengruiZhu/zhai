Complex physiological rhythms arise from a large variety of biological systems that include natural pacemakers as well as feedback mechanisms, from the heartbeat to the rhythmic movement of human walking. Accurately extracting and characterizing the fluctuations underlying the biological rhythms is a fundamental problem which holds the key to understanding the mechanisms that govern the dynamics of biological systems. Usually such signals demonstrate certain oscillatory patterns, with each period displaying irregular fluctuation, or nontrivial dynamics, over time. This renders traditional spectral methods and nonlinear techniques less effective. We propose a novel approach to highlight the intrinsic fluctuations masked by the periodic component and noise through advanced dimension-reduction techniques, and apply it to human gait data from healthy subjects and diabetics. We find that this approach is capable of extracting the intrinsic dynamics and identifying the subtle synchronization pattern between knee and ankle. We find that although the two groups of individuals demonstrate remarkable differences in the dynamics of ankle movement and ankle-knee synchronization, the knee movement of both groups show similar dynamics. These results suggest that sensory feedback from a peripheral nerve system (like the feet) does not play an important role in regulating the motor control of human walking.
