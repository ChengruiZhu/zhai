How an individual's genes are activated or silenced is an essential question impacting all fields of biology. Usually gene expression patterns, i.e., which genes are on and which are off in different tissues and during development, are highly reproducible; and those patterns are efficiently reset in the next generation of progeny. Paramutation represents an exception to these genetic rules, in that for certain genes the silencing that is established in an individual is efficiently transmitted to their progeny. Importantly, in these subsequent generations, the silenced gene continues to silence active versions of that gene. Prior work has demonstrated that these heritable gene expression changes are not accompanied by changes in DNA sequence: they are epigenetic. Understanding mechanisms for heritable changes in gene expression has major implications for researchers studying complex traits, including diseases. In this manuscript we demonstrate that a subunit of a RNA polymerase is required for paramutation in maize and other gene silencing processes that also involve RNAâ€“mediated chromatin changes. We show that the multiple, closely related, plant-specific RNA polymerases mediating gene silencing have diverged functions in maize. Results from our experiments suggest testable models for the role of these polymerases in multiple gene-silencing processes.
