Sequence quality (referred to alternatively as the level of sequencing error or noise) is a primary concern to all sequence-dependent investigations. This is particularly true in the field of metagenomics where automated tools (e.g. annotation pipelines like MG-RAST) rely on high fidelity sequence data to derive meaningful biological inferences, and is exacerbated by the capacity of next generation sequencing platforms that continue to expand at a rate greater than Moore's law. We demonstrate that the most commonly utilized means to assess sequencing error exhibit severe limitations with respect to analysis of metagenomic data. Furthermore, we introduce a method (DRISEE) that accounts for these limitations through the application of a novel approach to assess sequencing error. DRISEE-based analyses reveal previously unobserved levels of sequencing error. DRISEE provides a platform independent measure of sequencing error that objectively assesses the quality of entire sequence samples. This assessment can be used to exclude low quality samples from computationally expensive analyses (e.g. annotation). It can also be used to evaluate the relative fidelity of analyses after they have been performed (e.g. annotation of error prone samples is less reliable than that of samples with low levels of sequencing error).
