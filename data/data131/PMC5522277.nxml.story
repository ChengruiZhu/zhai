Resistance to docetaxel is a major clinical problem in advanced prostate cancer. The overexpression of AXL receptor tyrosine kinase (AXL) has been correlated with chemotherapeutic drug resistance. However, the role of AXL expression in docetaxel resistance in prostate cancer is yet unclear. In this study, we demonstrate that AXL is overexpressed and activated independent of Gas6 in docetaxel-resistant prostate cancer cells (PC3-DR and DU145-DR). Moreover, we show that forced overexpression of AXL in PC3 and DU145 cells is sufficient to induce resistance to docetaxel in these cell lines. Notably, genetic or pharmacologic inhibition of AXL in the resistant models suppressed cell proliferation, migration, invasion, and tumor growth, and these effects were significantly augmented when AXL inhibition was combined with docetaxel treatment. Mechanistically, we found that AXL inhibition led to reversion of the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) phenotype and decreased the expression of ATP-binding cassette B1 (ABCB1). Overall, our results identify AXL as an important mediator of docetaxel resistance in prostate cancer. We propose that AXL-targeted therapy, in combination with docetaxel, has the potential to improve the response to docetaxel therapy and reduce resistance induced by prolonged docetaxel therapy in prostate cancer.
