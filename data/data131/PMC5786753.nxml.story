 (MRSA) bloodstream infections. Less is known about the relative importance of these factors and their interactions in determining short-, medium-, and long-term mortality rates. This is an observational cohort study in which data for all patients admitted to the University of New Mexico (UNM) Health Sciences Center (HSC) between July 2002 and August 2013 with MRSA-positive blood cultures were recorded. We collected patients' demographics and treatment data, as well as data on genetic markers of the MRSA isolates. Outcomes of interest were determinants of short-term (within 30 days), medium-term (30 to 90 days), and long-term (>90 days) mortality rates. This study included 273 patients with MRSA bacteremia. Short-, medium-, and long-term mortality rates were 18.7%, 26.4%, and 48%, respectively. Thirty-day mortality rates were influenced by host variables and host-pathogen interaction characteristics. Pitt bacteremia scores, malignancy, and health care exposure contributed to 30- to 90-day mortality rates, while treatment duration of >4 weeks had a protective effect. Age remained a significant risk factor for death at >90 days, while admission leukocytosis was protective. Infection represented the most frequent cause of death for all three time frames; rates varied from 72.6% in the first 30 days and 60% for 30 to 90 days to 35.7% for >90 days (
