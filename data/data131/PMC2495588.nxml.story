As the effect of renin-angiotensin system (RAS) blockade on β-cells in clinical situations remains unclear, new evidence has been presented that angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and angiotensin ‖ receptor blockers (ARBs) may delay or prevent the development of insulin resistance and diabetes through novel mechanisms. This study aimed to determine the effects of ARBs on insulin excretion by β-cells. Hypertensive patients with impaired glucose tolerance were randomly divided into two groups: group A (n = 6), which received 8 mg/day of oral candesartan for three months, and controls (n = 6). Before and after administration, a 75 g oral glucose tolerance test was conducted to compare various parameters. No significant differences in age, body mass index (BMI), systolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic blood pressure (DBP), fasting glucose, or fasting immunoreactive insulin (IRI) were identified between the groups before administration. After three months, there were no significant changes in BMI, SBP, and DBP for the controls and in BMI and DBP for group A. However, SBP was significantly decreased from 144 ± 2.6 mmHg to 125 ± 4.6 mmHg in group A. Insulinogenic index tended to be slightly decreased for controls, but was significantly increased from 0.32 ± 0.0 to 0.47 ± 0.1 for group A. No significant changes in HOMA-R were identified in either group. To the best of our knowledge, no previous studies have documented a RAS inhibitor improving early-phase insulin response; thus, the present study may be the first of its kind.
