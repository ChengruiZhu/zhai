-lactide-co-glycolidic acid (PLGA) with bovine serum albumin (BSA) as a model protein. Despite many studies available with PLGA-based protein-loaded nanoparticles, production know-how, process parameters, protein loading, duration of protein release, narrowing polydispersity of particles have not been investigated enough to scale up manufacturing of protein-loaded nanoparticles in formulations. Different process parameters such as protein/polymer ratio, homogenizing speed during emulsifications, particle surface morphology and surface charges, particle size analysis and in-vitro protein release were investigated. The in-vitro protein release study suggests that release profile of BSA from nanoparticles could be modulated by changing protein-polymer ratios and/or by varying homogenizing speed during multiple-emulsion preparation technique. The formulation prepared with protein-polymer ratio of 1:60 at 17,500 rpm gave maximum protein-loading, minimum polydispersion with maximally sustained protein release pattern, among the prepared formulations. Decreased (10,000 rpm) or enhanced (24,000 rpm) homogenizing speeds resulted in increased polydispersion with larger particles having no better protein-loading and -release profiles in the present study.
