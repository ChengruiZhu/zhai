We identified 61 knees in 60 patients who underwent posterolateral knee reconstruction or repair. 26 knees in 25 patients (17 reconstructions and 9 repairs) were evaluated at mean of 41.86 months postoperatively (range: 6-108). Average IKDC scores for reconstruction and repair were 68.23 and 71.30, respectively. Average Lysholm scores for these groups were 83.11 for reconstructions and 83.30 for repairs. There were no statistically significant differences in IKDC or Lysholm scores between the repair and reconstruction groups. Average varus gapping with the knee at zero degrees was 8.21 and 8.84 millimeters (mm) for reconstructions and repairs, respectively. Average varus gapping at 20 degrees knee flexion was 11.25 mm for reconstructions and 10.34 mm for repairs. No statistically significant differences were observed in varus gapping between the two groups. Control knee measurements, 20 knees in 20 different controls, showed average varus gapping of 5.27 mm at zero degrees and 6.55 mm at 20 degrees knee flexion. There was a statistically significant difference in varus gapping when comparing the operatively treated knees to the control group. On review of all 61 knees, there were five failures: three failed reconstructions, two failed repairs. The other complication included one small wound dehiscence in the reconstruction group that resolved without intervention.
