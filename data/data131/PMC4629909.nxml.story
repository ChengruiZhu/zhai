Allergic inflammation is initiated when IgE antibodies bind to high-affinity receptors on the cell surface of mast cells and basophils, thereby triggering the release of proinflammatory mediators. The development and persistence of IgE responses in vivo is poorly characterized because of the low number of IgE-producing B cells and plasma cells. Naïve mature B cells produce IgM antibodies. Upon activation, they “switch” class to produce IgG, IgA, or IgE antibodies. It is currently highly debated whether IgE-expressing B cells are generated by direct switching from IgM-expressing B cells or by sequential switching via IgG1-expressing B cells. Using next generation sequencing, we compared thousands of IgE, IgG1, and IgM sequences after immunization of mice with parasitic worms and found a striking overlap between the IgE and IgG1 repertoires. We further show that the memory IgE response to a secondary encounter with the same parasitic worms was dependent on T cell-derived cytokines. Genetically modified mice and adoptive transfers of B cells revealed that the memory IgE response is conserved at the level of IgG1-expressing B cells. These results favor the concept that bona fide IgE-expressing B cells do not exist, and memory IgE responses unfold from IgG1-expressing B cells, which undergo a secondary switch reaction and differentiation to plasma cells.
