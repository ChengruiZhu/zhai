, U87 cells were transfected with mimics or inhibitors of miR-205 and miR-195. SMAD proteins were assayed by western blotting. Luciferase assay and co-immunoprecipitation (Co-IP) were used to determine the relationships between miR-205 and SMAD2, miR-195 and SMAD7. Effects of miR-205 and miR-195 on glioma cell proliferation and invasion using colony forming and cell migration assays. It was shown that miR-205 was decreased in glioma tissue, but miR-195 and TGF-β1 was increased. In addition, TGF-β1 concentration was negatively correlated with miR-205 mRNA level, but positively correlated with miR-195 mRNA. In addition, miR-205 was downregulated and miR-195 was upregulated by TGF-β1 in a dose-dependent manner. miR-205 and miR-195 targeted and inhibited SMAD2 and SMAD7 expression, respectively, in U87. High expression of miR-205 but not miR-195 reduced SMAD2 and SMAD4 heteromer formation. In addition, it was also shown that miR-205 overexpression inhibited U87 proliferation and invasion efficiently. All the results suggested that miR-205 and miR-195 participated in the TGF-β1 signaling pathway and showed opposite effects in glioma. These findings contribute to the understanding of TGF-β1 function in glioma.
