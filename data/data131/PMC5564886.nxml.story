The PearlDiver patient records database was used to query the 100% Medicare Standard Analytic Files from 2005-2012 patients undergoing shoulder arthroscopy procedures using CPT codes 29806, 29807, 29824, 29826, 29827 and 29828. Patients undergoing shoulder arthroscopy for a diagnosis of infection were excluded. Postoperative infection within 90 days postoperatively was then assessed using both ICD-9 codes for a diagnosis of postoperative infection or septic shoulder arthritis, or a procedure for these indications, including either open or arthroscopic irrigation and debridement. A multivariate binomial logistic regression analysis was then utilized to evaluate the use of an intraoperative steroid injection as well as numerous patient-related risk factors for postoperative infection, including: age, gender, obesity, morbid obesity, tobacco use, alcohol abuse, diabetes mellitus, inflammatory arthritis, hypercoagulable disorder, hyperlipidemia, hypertension, peripheral vascular disease, congestive heart failure, coronary artery disease, chronic lung disease, chronic liver disease, chronic kidney disease, use of hemodialysis, major depression, hypothyroidism and chronic anemia. Adjusted odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated for each risk factor, with P < 0.05 considered statistically significant.
