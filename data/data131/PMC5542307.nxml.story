Fifty-six participants were randomly assigned to each group. Table 1 summarizes the results to 12-months post-operative (collection of data to 24-months post-operative is ongoing until 2017). There were no significant differences in ASES score at pre- or post-surgery time points. In addition, no significant differences were found in WORC, surgery time, pain, or cramping. There was one significant difference in strength identified, the ratio of affected versus unaffected elbow flexion strength was greater in the tenodesis group (0.9 (SD=0.2)) versus the tenotomy group (0.8 (SD=0.3)) at 6-months post-operative. Otherwise, there were no differences in strength ratio identified for elbow flexion or supination strength or power at any time point. At 12-months post-surgery, the relative risk of cosmetic deformity in the tenotomy group relative to the tenodesis group based on patient report was 1.36 (p=0.41) with 12 out of 33 patients in the tenotomy group reporting a bulge in their upper arm compared to 8 out of 30 in the tenodesis group. Similar results were found based on clinical evaluation with a relative risk of 1.7 (p=0.36). MRI findings were available on 40 patients at the 12-month post-operative period. Of 23 in the tenodesis group, one was not intact and retracted 18 cm and two were partially torn. Of the 17 in the tenotomy group, none appeared retracted.
