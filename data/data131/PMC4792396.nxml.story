The total number of mitochondrial genomes in a human cell differs between individuals and between the tissues of a single individual; however the factors that influence this variation remain unknown. We estimated mtDNA copy number (mtCN) in 12 different tissues of 152 individuals applying three different methods, and found age-related variation for two tissues: mtCN in skeletal muscle is negatively correlated with age (especially in males) while mtCN in liver is positively correlated with age. Overall, mtCNs of different tissues within an individual are mainly independent of each other, indicating that tissue-specific rather than individual-specific processes largely influence mtCN. Heteroplasmy refers to intra-individual differences in the sequence of the mtDNA genome and heteroplasmic mutations accumulate during aging. Linear and partial regression analyses of mtCN with heteroplasmy (determined in a previous study of these same samples) revealed that the decrease of mtCN in skeletal muscle is mainly correlated with an increasing total number of heteroplasmic sites, and with increasing minor allele frequency at two sites (408 and 16327), that are heteroplasmic almost exclusively in skeletal muscle. As both sites are part of functional elements required for regulation of mtDNA replication, we suggest that selection may be acting via increasing heteroplasmy to reduce mtCN during aging.
