Osteogenesis Imperfecta (OI), also known as “brittle bone disease,” is an inherited condition with multiple defects in collagen-containing structures, including the bones, skin, and other connective tissues. Patients with OI suffer from short stature, scoliosis, thin skin, hearing loss, and, most notably, fragile bones that break with little or no trauma. Although many cases are due to dominantly inherited point mutations in the collagen genes, autosomal recessive forms have been described due to defects in the genes for Prolyl-3-Hydroxylase-1 (LEPRE1) and Cartilage-Associated Protein (CRTAP), proteins that modify newly synthesized procollagen. Some patients with OI do not have mutations in any of the known disease-related genes. Here, through the use of newly generated knockout mice, we identify the endoplasmic-reticulum resident prolyl-isomerase cyclophilin B (CypB) as a new autosomal recessive OI gene in mice. CypB, P3H1, and CRTAP were shown to have interrelated effects in maintaining their respective protein levels and ability to bind to collagen. These studies enhance our understanding about how collagen, the most abundant protein in the body, becomes properly assembled to form bones with adequate strength.
