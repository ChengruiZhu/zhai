This review article deals with a potentially sight threatening complication – rupture of the posterior capsule – during cataract surgery. Cataract surgery is the most commonly performed surgical procedure in ophthalmology and despite tremendous technical and technological advancements, posterior capsular rent (PCR) still occurs. PCR occurs both in the hands of experienced senior surgeons and the neophyte surgeons, although with a higher frequency in the latter group. Additionally, certain types of cataracts are prone to this development. If managed properly in a timely manner the eventual outcome may be no different from that of an uncomplicated case. However, improper management may lead to serious complications with a higher incidence of permanent visual disability. The article covers the management of posterior capsular rent from two perspectives: 1. Identifying patients at higher risk and measures to manage such patients by surgical discipline, and 2. Intraoperative management of posterior capsular rent and various case scenarios to minimize long-term complications. This review is written for experienced and not-so-experienced eye surgeons alike to understand and manage PCR.
