Chemotaxis is the movement of cells in response to spatial gradients of chemical cues. While single-celled organisms rely on sensing and responding to chemical gradients to search for nutrients, chemotaxis is also an essential component of the mammalian immune system. However, chemotaxis can also be deleterious, since chemotactic tumor cells can lead to metastasis. Due to its importance, understanding the process by which cells sense and respond to chemical gradients has attracted considerable interest. Moreover, because of the complexity of chemotactic signaling, which includes multiple feedback loops and redundant pathways, this has been a research area in which computational models have had a significant impact in understanding experimental findings. Here, we propose a modular description of the signaling network that regulates chemotaxis. The modules describe different processes that are observed in chemotactic cells. In addition to accounting for these behaviors individually, we show that the overall system recreates many features of the directed motion of migrating cells. The signaling described by our modules is implemented as a series of equations, whereas movement and the accompanying cellular deformations are simulated using a mechanical model of the cell and implemented using level set methods, a method that allows simulations of cells as they change morphology.
