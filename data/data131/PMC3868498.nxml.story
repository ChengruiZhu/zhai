Androgen receptor (AR) plays a critical role during the development and progression of prostate cancer in which microRNA miR-375 is overexpressed and correlated with tumor progression. Although DNA methylation is a key mechanism for the repression of gene expression, the relationship between AR and the expression or the hypermethylation of miR-375 is unknown. In this study, we found that AR-positive prostate cancer (PCa) cells showed high expression levels and hypomethylation of the miR-375. In contrast, AR-negative PCa cells displayed low levels and hypermethylation of the miR-375. Addition of 5-Aza-2â€²-deoxycytidine, a specific inhibitor of DNA methylation, into the culture medium reversed the low expression levels of miR-375 in the AR negative PCa cells. In addition, the total activity levels of DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs) were high in AR-negative PCa cells, in which hypermethylation of miR-375 promoter and low expression levels of miR-375 were observed. Taken together, these findings indicate that the negative correlation between AR and total DNMT activity is one of mechanisms to influence the methylation status of miR-375 promoter, which in turn regulates the expression of miR-375.
