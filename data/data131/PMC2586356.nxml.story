As with all mathematical models, the accuracy of the predictions made by this model depend on the many assumptions incorporated into the model. In addition, because data from Tanzania were fed into the model, its predictions are to some extent specific to the area. Nevertheless the Tanzanian setting is typical of sub-Saharan malaria-affected areas, and the authors show that varying their assumptions and the data fed into the model within realistic ranges in most cases does not substantially change their overall conclusions. The findings in this study suggest that in low-transmission areas, provided ACT is widely used, ACT may reduce malaria transmission as effectively as the widespread use of insecticide-treated bed nets. The findings also suggest that the use of longer-acting regimens with or without artemisinin components might be a good way to reduce transmission in high-transmission areas, provided the development of parasite resistance can be avoided. More generally, these findings suggest that public-health officials need to take the properties of antimalarial drugs into account together with the levels of transmission in the area when designing policies in order to achieve the highest impact on malaria transmission.
