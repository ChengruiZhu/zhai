Recent decades have seen a revolution in experimental techniques that has shifted the focus of experimental biology from behaviors at the micron (cell) scale to those at the nanometer (molecular) scale. An ever-increasing number of studies detail subcellular behaviors, genetic pathways and protein interactions that relate to specific cell functions. This progress, while welcome, sometimes leads us to forget that these components do not exist or function in isolation. To understand their biological importance, in addition to exploring individual components in more detail, we must integrate them into comprehensive models of cells, tissues, organs and organisms. This integration has been incomplete for somitogenesis, an early developmental process that establishes the first signs of segmentation in all vertebrates, patterning the precursors of the vertebrae, ribs, and skeletal muscles of the back and limbs. In this paper, we make significant progress towards a comprehensive model of somitogenesis by combining specialized hypotheses for specific subcomponent mechanisms of somitogenesis into a unified multi-scale model that successfully reproduces many characteristic events seen in the embryo.
