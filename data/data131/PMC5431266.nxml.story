The aim of the present study was to identify the most useful markers for predicting recurrence of keratocystic odontogenic tumors (KCOTs). A total of 65 tumor samples from 63 patients diagnosed with typical parakeratinized cysts and KCOTs between 1992 and 2014 were retrospectively studied. Clinical and histopathological data and treatment modality were reviewed. In addition, the expression profiles of Ki-67, cluster of differentiation (CD)34 and podoplanin were assessed using immunohistochemistry. The association between these factors and the rate of KCOT recurrence was evaluated. The presence of daughter cysts, epithelial islands and high Ki-67, CD34 and podoplanin expression levels were revealed to be associated with tumor recurrence. In particular, univariate analysis revealed that high CD34 expression levels were significantly associated with tumor recurrence (P=0.034), as was conservative surgical treatment (P=0.003). Multivariate analysis revealed that conservative treatment was the greatest independent risk factor for tumor recurrence (odds ratio=13.337; P=0.018). These results suggest that overexpression of CD34 may be a potent predictor of tumor recurrence and radical treatment of the teeth that are in contact with the tumors is recommended in order to prevent tumor recurrence.
