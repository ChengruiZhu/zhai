Recovery from destruction by sodium deoxycholate (DOC) was studied with the receptor membrane of the blowfly, Phormia regina. The recovery can be divided into two processes, colchicine dependent and colchicine independent. The colchicine-dependent process was completely depressed by pretreatment with colchicine at 5 mM for 2 min (partially at 0.1 mM for 10 min), but the colchicine-independent one persisted. Vinblastine also caused depression but lumicolchicine did not. Records of responses obtained from the DOC-treated sugar receptor showed long response latencies that gradually became indistinct with recovery. Colchicine also affected this change in response latency after the DOC treatment. These results suggest that the colchicine-dependent recovery process is related to microtubules in the distal process of the receptor cell. The recovery time course and the change in response latency could be quantitatively explained by the simple assumptions that DOC underwent desorption from the receptor membrane (colchicine-independent recovery process) and that regeneration of the disrupted distal process of the receptor cell accompanied recovery in the number of available receptor sites (colchicine-dependent recovery process).
