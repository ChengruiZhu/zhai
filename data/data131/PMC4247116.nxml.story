Adrenocortical carcinoma (ACC) is a rare, but highly aggressive type of tumor with an incidence of one to two per million annually. Adrenocortical carcinosarcoma is an exceptional variant of ACC, which is characterized by the presence of histological regions of carcinoma and sarcoma. To date, to the best of our knowledge, there have only been 12 reported cases of adrenocortical carcinosarcoma. In the present study, a case of primary, non-functional adrenocortical carcinosarcoma is described, as well as a review of the literature to raise awareness of this particularly rare type of malignant neoplasm that is associated with a worse diagnosis and prognosis than adrenocortical carcinoma. In the present study, the patient underwent a laparoscopic left adrenalectomy and the tumor was dissected without complication from the left kidney. Microscopic observations showed the tumor comprised of epithelial and spindle cell components. The patient did not exhibit signs of tumor recurrence at the one-month follow-up. The potential diagnosis of adrenocortical carcinosarcoma must be considered when diagnosing adrenal malignancies in adults. In addition, comphrensive imunohistochemical staining may be required to identify possible sarcomatous patterns. To the best of our knowledge, the present case is the first to report an incidence of adrenocortical carcinosarcoma in China. Details of the patient are presented and the pathology of adrenocortical carcinosarcoma is discussed.
