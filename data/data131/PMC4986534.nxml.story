Activation of various C-type lectin receptors (CLRs) initiates potent proinflammatory responses against various microbial infections. However, how activated CLRs are negatively regulated remains unknown. In this study, we report that activation of CLRs Dectin-2 and Dectin-3 by fungi infections triggers them for ubiquitination and degradation in a Syk-dependent manner. Furthermore, we found that E3 ubiquitin ligase Casitas B–lineage lymphoma protein b (Cbl-b) mediates the ubiquitination of these activated CLRs through associating with each other via adapter protein FcR-γ and tyrosine kinase Syk, and then the ubiquitinated CLRs are sorted into lysosomes for degradation by an endosomal sorting complex required for transport (ESCRT) system. Therefore, the deficiency of either Cbl-b or ESCRT subunits significantly decreases the degradation of activated CLRs, thereby resulting in the higher expression of proinflammatory cytokines and inflammation. Consistently, Cbl-b–deficient mice are more resistant to fungi infections compared with wild-type controls. Together, our study indicates that Cbl-b negatively regulates CLR-mediated antifungal innate immunity, which provides molecular insight for designing antifungal therapeutic agents.
