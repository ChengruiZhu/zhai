Linear filter descriptions of sensory neurons have been with us since the 1970s, and have been enormously influential. But such models, and more recent nonlinear variants, are rather like modeling the entire network as a single neuron, failing to account for the neuron's response being a consequence of a network of many nonlinear units. Here we show how these limitations can be overcome by using recent advances in machine learning to fit “network receptive field models” to neural responses to natural sounds. Feedforward networks of 1–7 nonlinearly-interacting lower-order model neurons are required to model a cortical receptive field. Each lower order neuron is tuned to somewhat different stimulus features, arranged together in complex but interpretable structures, which cover a far wider range of sound frequencies and delays than current receptive field models indicate. The NRF models capture important nonlinear functional characteristics in auditory cortical neurons, including multiplicative gain control and conjunctive feature selectivity, where neurons respond when certain features are present together but not in isolation. This enables NRFs to predict the responses of auditory cortical neurons with considerably greater accuracy than conventional models.
