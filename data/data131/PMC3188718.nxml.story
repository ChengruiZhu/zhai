One-hundred two patients had adult type disease, with a mean age of 46.2 years (range, 18 to 83 years) and a mean follow-up period of 54.7 months (range, 1 to 155 months). The distribution of FIGO stages was 86 patients at stage I, 11 at stage II, and 5 at stage III. During follow-up, ten patients recurred at a mean time of 48 months (range, 4 to 109 months). Among them, three patients died after a mean of 57 months (range, 25 to 103 months). In recurrence analysis, advanced stage (p=0.032) and presence of residual disease (p=0.012) were statistically significant, and age<40 years, premenopause and positive washing cytology were marginally significant (p<0.1). In multivariate analysis, stage was the only factor associated with recurrence; adjuvant chemotherapy and fertility-sparing surgery were not statistically significant. Among 36 patients with fertility-sparing operations, eight patients had nine pregnancies and delivered seven babies. Eleven patients had juvenile type tumors; the mean age was 20.0 years (range, 8 to 45 years) and the mean follow-up period was 69.8 months (range, 20 to 156 months). The distribution of FIGO stage was nine patients at stage I and two at stage III. There were no recurrences or deaths reported. Four patients had seven pregnancies and delivered six babies.
