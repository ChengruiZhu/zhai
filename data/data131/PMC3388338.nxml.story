The role of the process of apoptosis is investigated in the pathogenesis of many autoimmune diseases; however at present, there is not much information about its role in dermatitis herpetiformis. Skin biopsies were taken from 18 DH patients and from 10 healthy subjects. The localization and expression of Bax, Fas, FasL, TRAIL, TRAIL-R in skin lesions, and perilesional skin were studied by immunohistochemistry. Expression of Bax, Fas, and Fas ligand was detected in the keratinocytes in skin biopsies from DH patients. Expression of TRAIL and TRAIL receptor was confirmed in epidermis, infiltration cells, and some fibroblasts. The expression of examined molecules in biopsies from healthy people was observed only in single cells. There were statistically significant differences between lesional, perilesional, and healthy skin of control group in Bax expression analysis and between lesional skin and control group in Fas, FasL, and TRAIL expression. There were statistically significant differences between control group and perilesional skin in Bax and FasL expression. Our results show that selected proapoptotic molecules may take part in pathogenesis of dermatitis herpetiformis, but the role of apoptosis in this process is not clear.
