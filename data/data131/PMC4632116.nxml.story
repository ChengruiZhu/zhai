Human adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells (hADMSCs) are believed to be potential key factors for starting the regenerative process after tissue injury. However, an efficient method of delivering these regenerative cells to an external wound site is still lacking. Human amnion and pig skin have long been used as skin wound dressings for the treatment of burns and other skin lesions. Herein, we present the generation of two constructs using these two biomaterials as effective scaffolds for the culture of hADMSCs. It was found that hADMSCs seeded onto radiosterilized human amnion and pig skin are viable and proliferate. These cells are able to migrate over these scaffolds as demonstrated by using time-lapse microscopy. In addition, the scaffolds induce hADMSCs to secrete interleukin-10, an important negative regulator of inflammation, and interleukin-1Î², a proinflammatory protein. The interplay between these two proteins has been proven to be vital for a balanced restoration of all necessary tissues. Thus, radiosterilized human amnion and pig skin are likely suitable scaffolds for delivery of hADMSCs transplants that could promote tissue regeneration in skin injuries like patients with burn injuries.
