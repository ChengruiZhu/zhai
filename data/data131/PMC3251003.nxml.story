The present study was conducted to assess the pulmonary and systemic responses in rats after intratracheal instillation of highly pure, well-dispersed, and well-characterized SWCNTs. Exposure to SWCNTs up to 2mg/kg did not produce mortality, changes in clinical signs, or body weights during the observation period. Dose-dependent changes were observed in the lung weight, BALF inflammatory cells, and biochemical parameters such as LDH value, protein content, IL-1Î² and IL-6 activity, and histopathology. In the 0.04 mg/kg SWCNT-exposed group, almost no changes were observed during the observation period. In the 0.2 mg/kg SWCNT-exposed group, pulmonary inflammatory responses were observed after instillation. In the 1 mg/kg and 2 mg/kg SWCNT-exposed group, acute lung inflammation and subsequent granuloma accompanied by increased lung weights were observed. Furthermore, the histopathological findings in the lungs of rats exposed to SWCNTs showed inflammatory responses related with the vital reaction to the foreign substance that was instilled intratracheally, and there were no fibrosis, atypical lesion, or tumor-related findings even at the highest dose (2 mg/kg) of SWCNT-exposed groups up to 6 months after instillation. For all groups, histopathological changes due to the instillation exposure of SWCNTs were observed only in the lungs and lung-associated lymph nodes and not in the other tissues examined (i.e. the liver, kidney, spleen, and cerebrum).
