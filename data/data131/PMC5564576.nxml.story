Alpha-mangostin, a natural xanthonoid, has been reported to possess the anti-cancer property in various types of human cancer. However, its effects and mechanism of α-mangostin in cervical cancer remain unclear. We found that α-mangostin effectively inhibited cell viability, resulted in loss of mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP), release of cytochrome C, increase of Bax, decrease of Bcl-2, and activation of caspase-9/caspase-3 cascade in cervical cancer cells. Alpha-mangostin elevated the contents of reactive oxygen species (ROS) to activate p38. Disrupting ASK1/p38 signaling pathway by a specific inhibitor of p38, or by the siRNAs against ASK1, MKK3/6, or p38, significantly abolished α-mangostin-induced cell death and apoptotic responses. Moreover, α-mangostin also repressed tumor growth in accordance with increased levels of p-ASK1, p-p38, cleaved-PARP and cleaved-caspase-3 in the tumor mass from the mouse xenograft model of cervical cancer. In the current study, we provided first evidence to demonstrate that dietary antioxidant α-mangostin could inhibit the tumor growth of cervical cancer cells through enhancing ROS amounts to activate ASK1/p38 signaling pathway and damage the integrity of mitochondria and thereby induction of apoptosis in cervical cancer cells.
