The lung microbiota is commonly sampled using relatively invasive bronchoscopic procedures. Exhaled breath condensate (EBC) collection potentially offers a less invasive alternative for lung microbiota sampling. We compared lung microbiota samples retrieved by protected specimen brushings (PSB) and exhaled breath condensate collection. We also sought to assess whether aerosolized antibiotic treatment would influence the lung microbiota and whether this change could be detected in EBC. EBC was collected from 6 conscious sheep and then from the same anesthetized sheep during mechanical ventilation. Following the latter EBC collection, PSB samples were collected from separate sites within each sheep lung. On the subsequent day, each sheep was then treated with nebulized colistimethate sodium. Two days after nebulization, EBC and PSB samples were again collected. Bacterial DNA was quantified using 16S rRNA gene quantitative PCR. The V2-V3 region of the 16S rRNA gene was amplified by PCR and sequenced using Illumina MiSeq. Quality control and operational taxonomic unit (OTU) clustering were performed with mothur. The EBC samples contained significantly less bacterial DNA than the PSB samples. The EBC samples from anesthetized animals clustered separately by their bacterial community compositions in comparison to the PSB samples, and 37 bacterial OTUs were identified as differentially abundant between the two sample types. Despite only low concentrations of colistin being detected in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, PSB samples were found to differ by their bacterial compositions before and after colistimethate sodium treatment. Our findings indicate that microbiota in EBC samples and PSB samples are not equivalent.
