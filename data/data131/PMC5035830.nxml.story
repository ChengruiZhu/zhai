 A 75-year-old female underwent PCNL for partial staghorn stone in the left kidney. During puncturing and dilatation, renal vein tributary was injured, and the nephroscope entered the renal vein and inferior vena cava, which was clearly recognized. Injection of contrast material through the nephroscope confirms the false pathway to the great veins (renal vein and inferior vena cava). Bleeding was controlled intraoperatively by applying Amplatz sheath over the abnormal tract, the procedure was continued and stones were removed. At the end of the procedure, a Foley catheter was used as a nephrostomy tube and its balloon was inflated inside the renal pelvis and pulled back with light pressure to the lower calix, which was the site of injury to the renal vein tributaries, then the nephrostomy tube was closed; by this we effectively controlled the bleeding. The patient remained hemodynamically stable; antegrade pyelography was done on the second postoperative day, there was distally patent ureter with no extravasation, neither contrast leak to renal vein, and was discharged home at third postoperative day. After 2 weeks, the nephrostomy tube was gradually removed in the operative room, without bleeding, on the next day, Double-J stent was removed.
