10-Hydroxycamptothecin (10-HCPT) is a promising anticancer drug with a wide spectrum of antitumor activities. Due to its poor solubility, the carboxylate form that shows high water solubility but minimal anticancer activity and pharmacokinetic defects is used in the marketed 10-HCPT injections, resulting in its limited clinical application. To develop a simple, safe, and highly effective drug delivery system, a modified acidâ€“base microprecipitation combined with a high-pressure homogenization technique was adopted to prepare 10-HCPT nanocrystals. Neither organic solvents nor stabilizers were employed throughout the preparation process. The in vitro and in vivo performances of the resulting10-HCPT nanocrystals were investigated systematically. The nanocrystals were spherical with a small size of ~130 nm, and the actual drug-loading content was as high as 75%. The nanocrystals displayed a sustained release pattern and were proven to have a higher cell uptake and antiproliferative activity than the 10-HCPT injections. The 10-HCPT nanocrystals also showed enhanced drug accumulation in tumors and better anticancer efficacy in 4T1-bearing mice. In summary, the 10-HCPT nanocrystals prepared in this study seem to be a promising delivery system for a new form of 10-HCPT dosages.
