The current study presents a case of extranodal follicular dendritic cell sarcoma (FDCS) of the tonsil and reviews the relevant literature. In the present case, a 59-year-old male presented with a globus sensation in the right pharynx for 6 weeks. On clinical examination, a painless non-ulcerated enlarged right tonsil was identified; the tonsil was covered with a normal mucus membrane. A right tonsillectomy was performed under general anesthesia. The final pathological diagnosis was follicular dendritic cell sarcoma of the right tonsil. Postoperatively, the patient received radiotherapy. The patient remains alive without disease recurrence or metastasis 44 months after tonsillectomy. To the best of our knowledge, only 42 cases of FDCS of the tonsil have been reported to date. Of the 42 cases, 41 patients underwent surgery and one patient refused treatment. A total of 23 (54.7%) received surgery alone. Adjuvant treatment was administered for 18 patients (42.9%). Six patients (14.3%) experienced local recurrences and two patients (4.8%) succumbed to the disease 24 months after treatment. The three-, five-, and eight-year overall survival rates for the entire group were 86.5, 77.8 and 77.8%, respectively. Furthermore, a tumor diameter of ≥4 cm was prognostic upon univariate analysis (χ
