This network meta-analysis (NMA) was conducted to integrate different chemotherapeutic regimens for non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) patients. Overall survival (OS) and complete remission (CR) were considered as main outcome indicators to evaluate the efficacy of NHL chemotherapies. OS and CR data were extracted from included studies and represented by hazard ratio and odds ratio separately. Network structure and forest plots were further included to visually present the relative efficacy among different regimens. A total of 14 qualified publications with 4,167 patients were included. In OS results, no significant difference was observed from the 1-year OS. For 2-year, 3-year and 5-year OS, patients treated by CNOP exhibited the least favorable results. Moreover, significant advantages of R-CHOP treatment over CHOP and VMP were recognized in view of 3-year OS. In respect of CR, R-HDS presented significantly better outcomes than CNOP and VMP, and no significant difference was identified when compared to CHOP in forest plot. ProMACE-CytaBOM and R-HDS possessed the compelling cumulative ranking probability in OS or CR, indicating their competitive performance in NHL treatment while R-CHOP and I-CHOP yielded desirable in terms of long-term survival and short-term survival, respectively. To conclude, ProMACE-CytaBOM, I-CHOP, R-HDS and R-CHOP were recommended to go through further evaluation to confirm their superiority in NHL treatment. CNOP and VMP were discouraged after comprehensively analyzing OS and CR from NMA results.
