The AID / APOBEC genes are a family of cytidine deaminases that have evolved in vertebrates, and particularly mammals, to mutate RNA and DNA at distinct preferred nucleotide contexts (or “hotspots”) on foreign genomes such as viruses and retrotransposons. These enzymes play a pivotal role in intrinsic immunity defense mechanisms, often deleteriously mutating invading retroviruses or retrotransposons and, in the case of AID, changing antibody sequences to drive affinity maturation. We investigate the strength of various hotspots on their known biological targets by evaluating the potential impact of mutations on the DNA coding sequences of these targets, and compare these results to hypothetical hotspots that did not evolve. We find that the existing AID / APOBEC hotspots have a large impact on retrotransposons and non-mammalian viruses while having a much smaller effect on vital mammalian genes, suggesting co-evolution with AID / APOBECs may have had an impact on the genomes of the viruses we analyzed. We determine that GC content appears to be a significant, but not sole, factor in resistance to deaminase activity. We discuss possible mechanisms AID and APOBEC viral targets have adopted to escape the impacts of deamination activity, including changing the GC content of the genome.
