Alcoholism is a complex condition of compulsive alcohol use that results in devastating physical and social consequences. The development of this affliction is believed to arise in part by homeostatic adaptations in the brain that lead to the development of alcohol tolerance and dependence. These adaptations are strongly influenced by a great number of genetic and environmental conditions. Identifying the relevant factors that define alcohol tolerance and dependence has been a major objective of neurobiology research for many decades. Here we use a novel genomic approach that exploits the analysis of epigenetic modifications and the power of Drosophila genetics to identify a network of genes with a potential role in the neuroadaptations that lead to alcohol tolerance. Gene-expression profiling and subsequent gene ontology analysis revealed that the group of genes identified here is highly enriched with genes involved in the activity-dependent modulation of synaptic transmission. Because of the strong conservation of regulatory gene networks between Drosophila and mammals, we believe that the network identified here will serve as a powerful guide for the identification of the regulatory events that lead to human alcohol tolerance.
