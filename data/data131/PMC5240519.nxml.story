 gene between these mostly allopatric (but in few cases sympatric) eleven lineages is extremely high (up to 7.4%), i.e. much deeper than the “standard” DNA barcode species threshold (2.7–3%). This level of divergence normally could correspond not even to different species, but to different genera. Despite this divergence, the bearers of these haplogroups were found to be morphologically indistinguishable and, most importantly, to share absolutely the same ecological niches, i.e. demonstrating the pattern which is hardly compatible with hypothesis of multiple cryptic species. Most likely such a profound irregularity in barcodes is caused by reasons other than speciation and represents an extraordinary example of intra-species barcode variability. Given the deep level of genetic differentiation between the lineages, we assume that there was a long period (up to 5.0 My) of allopatric differentiation when the lineages were separated by geographic or/and ecological barriers and evolved in late Pliocene and Pleistocene refugia of north Africa, the Iberian and Balkan Peninsulas, the Middle East and Central Asia. We discuss the refugia-within-refugia concept as a mechanism explaining the presence of additional diverged minor haplogroups within the areas of the major haplogroups. We also provide the first record of
