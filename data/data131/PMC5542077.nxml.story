Eighteen hips, 10 left and 8 right, in 17 patients met inclusion criteria. The average age at the time of surgery was 26.8±SD10.3 years (range, 14-43 years) including nine females and eight males. Average radiographic follow-up was 112.1± SD17.4 months (range, 84-143 months). Initial radiographic correction of the cam-deformity was significant for HNO (7.0±SD2.5 vs. 11.3±SD2.5, p < .001), HNOR (0.12±.04 vs. 0.20±.04, p < .001), and α angle (53.2±14.0 vs. 38.9±5.7, p < .001). A small and gradual change in HNO (11.29±SD2.50 vs. 10.56±SD7.16), HNOR (0.199±.039 vs. 0.195±.138) and α angle (38.92±5.70 vs. 39.36±16.68) was observed across longitudinal follow-up but was not statistically significant (p = .645, p = .851; and p = .835; respectively) (see Figure 1). Only two hips (11%) demonstrated a decrease in HNOR > 0.02. One of these hips had an osteophyte in a patient with progression of osteoarthritis who subsequently underwent total hip arthroplasty three months later. After removing the osteoarthritic patient as an outlier, we continued to observe only small and gradual change in HNO (11.27±SD2.59 vs. 12.13±SD3.56), HNOR (0.20±SD.04 vs. 0.22±SD.70), and α angle (38.8±SD5.9 vs. 35.4±SD4.7) that was not statistically significant (p = 0.631, p = 0.312, p = 0.162; respectively). Recorticalization was present in 78% of hips (13 partial and 1) at an average follow-up of 22.8 months (range, 10-36 months). Recorticalization was present in 100% of hips (6 partial and 12 ) at final follow-up.
