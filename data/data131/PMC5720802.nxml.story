What brain mechanisms underlie conscious perception? A commonly adopted paradigm for studying this question is to present human subjects with threshold-level stimuli. When shown repeatedly, the same stimulus is sometimes consciously perceived, sometimes not. Using magnetoencephalography, we shed light on the neural mechanisms governing whether the stimulus is consciously perceived in a given trial. We observed that depending on the initial brain state defined by widespread activity pattern in the slow cortical potential (<5 Hz) range, a physically identical, brief (30–60 ms) stimulus input triggers distinct sequences of activity pattern evolution over time that correspond to either consciously perceiving the stimulus or not. Such activity pattern evolution forms a “trajectory” in the state space and affords significant single-trial decoding of perceptual outcome from 1 sec before to 3 sec after stimulus onset. While previous theories on conscious perception have emphasized sustained, high-level activity, we found that brain dynamics underlying conscious perception exhibit fast-changing activity patterns. These results significantly further our understanding on the neural mechanisms governing conscious access of a stimulus and the dynamical nature of distributed neural activity underlying conscious perception.
