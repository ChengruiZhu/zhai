Although multicentric Castleman disease is a rare but life-threatening disease, eye complications are extremely uncommon. We present a case of refractory uveitis accompanied with Castleman disease successfully treated with tocilizumab. A 58-year-old man with Castleman disease was introduced for refractory uveitis to Chiba University Hospital. Large cells were detected in the anterior chamber and increased vascular permeability of retinal vessels has been found in both eyes. Although the patient was treated with oral and eye drop steroid treatment, the uveitis symptoms had not decreased. The serum levels of CRP and IL-6 were increased. The level of IL-6 concentration in the anterior chamber was the same as the serum level of IL-6. The humanized anti-IL-6 receptor-antibody (tocilizumab) was administrated for the patient because of poor general condition. After tocilizumab treatment, large cells in the anterior chamber were undetectable and vascular permeability was improved in FA. The serum levels of CRP and IL-6 decreased and the general condition improved. The side effect of tocilizumab was not observed during the treatment. Tocilizumab treatment was significantly effective for uveitis accompanied with Castleman disease. Although it is extremely rare, uveitis accompanied with Castleman disease may be one of the hallmarks to consider tocilizumab treatment.
