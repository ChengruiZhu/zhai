During embryonic development different cell types arise at different times and places. This diversity is produced by a relatively small number of signals and depends, at least in part, on changes in the way cells respond to each signal. One example of this so-called change in “competence” is found in the vertebrate spinal cord where a signal, Sonic Hedgehog (Shh), induces a glial cell type known as floor plate (FP) at early developmental times, while the same signal later induces specific types of neurons. Here, we dissected the molecular mechanism underlying the change in competence, and found that another signal, FGF, is involved through its control of the transcription factor Nkx1.2. In embryos, Shh and FGF are produced perpendicular to one another and FP is induced where the two signals intersect. The position of this intersection changes as the embryo elongates and this determines the place and time FP is produced. A similar strategy also appears to apply to another cell type, neural crest. In this case, the intersection of FGF with BMP signal is crucial. Together the data provide new insight into the spatiotemporal control of cell type specification during development of the vertebrate spinal cord.
