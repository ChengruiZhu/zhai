 postoperative day. A chest X-ray was performed which was suggestive of fluid overload. His fluid was restricted and diuretics were added. On the same day, his pulmonary infiltrates worsened and a computed tomography (CT) of the chest was carried out, which was suggestive of the right lower lobe consolidation and left pleural effusion. He underwent a bronchoscopy and the lavage was sent for cultures, which did not grow any infective organism. Besides routine antibiotics, treatment for possible cytomegalovirus, fungal infections, and pneumocystis infection was instituted. Noninvasive ventilation was started on day 8. A repeat CT of the chest on the postoperative day 8 showed further worsening of the pulmonary infiltrates. As all the initial cultures and serology were negative, a possibility of interstitial pneumonitis was considered. Mycophenolate sodium was considered as a possible cause of the lung infiltrates and was withdrawn. The patient showed progressive improvement. His antibiotics were withdrawn. He was discharged on day 14. A repeat CT 4 weeks post transplant showed significant improvement in his pulmonary pathology. The acute lung injury was considered to be a drug reaction secondary to mycophenolate sodium. In a renal allograft recipient with persistent pulmonary infiltrates, interstitial involvement secondary to drugs should be considered if the patient does not improve with the standard treatment measures.
