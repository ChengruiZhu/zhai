Eagle's syndrome is characterised by focal pain in the tonsillar fossa on wide mouth opening or head rotation and various accompanying symptoms. While the syndrome is difficult to diagnose, shortening the styloid process via a transoral or transcervical surgical approach has been shown to be the most effective treatment. The aim of this article was to document our experience with a transoral robotic approach to treat Eagle's syndrome and to present the outcomes of four patients. We reviewed the cases of four patients with Eagle's syndrome who underwent transoral robotic surgery (TORS). The average age of patients was 53.75 years, and there were equal numbers of males and females. The styloid processes were reconstructed in 3D from the preoperative CT scans and were measured as an average of 4.18 cm (range 3.3-5.1). The mean set-up time and operation times were less than 10 minutes and 30 minutes, respectively. All patients were completely relieved of symptoms, and were able to restart an oral diet on post-operative day 1. No patient suffered intraoperative or postoperative complication, including cranial nerve injury, haemorrhage, or deep neck infection. In our experience, transoral excision of the styloid process via a robotic approach can be considered as a feasible treatment option for Eagle's syndrome.
