: methylene blue), traditional stainings (including silver impregnation), phase contrast and non-conventional light microscopy (Epon-embedded semithin sections), transmission electron microscopy (TEM) (serial ultrathin sections), stereology, immunohistochemistry (IHC) and immunofluorescence (IF) with molecular probes. Cardiomyocytes occupy about 75% of rat ventricular myocardium volume. ICLC represent ∼32% of the number of interstitial cells and the ratio cardiomyocytes/ICLC is about 70/1. In the interstitium, ICLC establish close contacts with nerve fibers, myocytes, blood capillaries and with immunoreactive cells (stromal synapses). ICLC show characteristic cytoplasmic processes, frequently two or three, which are very long (tens up to hundreds of μm), very thin (0.1-0.5μm thick), with uneven caliber, having dilations, resulting in a moniliform aspect. Gap junctions between such processes can be found. Usually, the dilations are occupied by mitochondria (as revealed by Janus green B and Mito Tracker Green FM) and elements of endoplasmic reticulum. Characteristically, some prolongations are flat, with a veil-like appearance, forming a labyrinthic system. ICLC display caveolae (about 1 caveola/1μm cell membrane length, or 2-4% of the relative cytoplasmic volume, Mitochondria and endoplasmic reticulum (rough and smooth) occupy 5-10% and 1-2% of cytoplasmic volume, respectively. IHC revealed positive staining for CD34, EGFR and vimentin and, only in a few cases for CD117. IHC was negative for: desmin, CD57, tau, chymase, tryptase and CD13. IF showed that ventricular ICLC expressed connexin 43. We may speculate that possible ICLC roles might be:
