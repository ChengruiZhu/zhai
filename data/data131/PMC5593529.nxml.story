]. In this study, we have further explored the differences between p85α and p85β by genetic truncations and substitutions. We have discovered unexpected activities of the mutant proteins that reflect regulatory functions of distinct p85 domains. These results can be summarized as follows: Deletion of the SH3 domain increases oncogenic and PI3K signaling activity. Deletion of the combined SH3-RhoGAP domains abolishes these activities. In p85β, deletion of the cSH2 domain reduces oncogenic and signaling activities. In p85α, such a deletion has an activating effect. The deletions of the combined cSH2 and iSH2 domains and also the deletion of the cSH2, iSH2 and nSH2 domains yield results that go in the same direction, generally activating in p85α and reducing activity in p85β. The contrasting functions of the cSH2 domains are verified by domain exchanges with the cSH2 domain of p85β exerting an activating effect and the cSH2 domain of p85α an inactivating effect, even in the heterologous isoform. In the cell systems studied, protein stability was not correlated with oncogenic and signaling activity. These observations significantly expand our knowledge of the isoform-specific activities of p85α and p85β and of the functional significance of specific domains for regulating the catalytic subunits of class IA PI3K.
