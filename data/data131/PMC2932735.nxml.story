, and assessed their functional properties using mouse (C57BL/6) bone marrow-derived DC (BMDC) and NK cells. NK cell activation was evaluated by three criteria: IFN-Î³ production, up-regulation of NK activation markers and cytokines, and NK target (B16D8 cell) cytotoxicity. The diacylated lipopeptides acted as TLR2 ligands, inducing up-regulation of CD25/CD69/CD86, IL-6, and IL-12p40, which represent maturation of BMDC. Strikingly, the Pam2Cys lipopeptides induced mouse NK cell activation based on these criteria. Cell-cell contact by Pam2Cys peptide-stimulated BMDC and NK cells rather than soluble mediators released by stimulated BMDC induced activation of NK cells. For most lipopeptides, the BMDC TLR2/MyD88 pathway was responsible for driving NK activation, while some slightly induced direct activation of NK cells via the TLR2/MyD88 pathway in NK cells. The potential for NK activation was critically regulated by the peptide primary sequence. Hydrophobic or proline-containing sequences proximal to the N-terminal lipid moiety interfered with the ability of lipopeptides to induce BMDC-mediated NK activation. This mode of NK activation is distinctly different from that induced by polyI:C, which is closely associated with type I IFN-inducing pathways of BMDC. These results imply that the MyD88 pathway of BMDC governs an alternative NK-activating pathway in which the peptide sequence of TLR2-agonistic lipopeptides critically affects the potential for NK activation.
