Eliglustat, an oral substrate reduction therapy, is a first‐line treatment for adults with Gaucher disease type 1 (GD1) who are poor, intermediate, or extensive CYP2D6 metabolizers (>90% of patients). In the primary analysis of the Phase 3 ENGAGE trial (NCT00891202), eliglustat treatment for 9 months resulted in significant reductions in spleen and liver volumes and increases in hemoglobin concentration and platelet count compared with placebo. We report 18‐month outcomes of patients who entered the trial extension period, in which all patients received eliglustat. Of 40 trial patients, 39 entered the extension period, and 38 completed 18 months. Absolute values and percent change over time were determined for spleen and liver volume, hemoglobin concentration, platelet count, bone mineral density, bone marrow burden, and Gaucher disease biomarkers. For patients randomized to eliglustat in the double‐blind period, continuing treatment with eliglustat for 9 more months resulted in incremental improvement of all disease parameters. For patients randomized to placebo in the double‐blind period, eliglustat treatment during the 9‐month, open‐label period resulted in significant decrease of spleen and liver volumes and significant increase of hemoglobin and platelets, with a similar rate of change to patients who had received eliglustat in the double‐blind period. Eliglustat treatment was also associated with improvement in bone marrow burden score, bone mineral density, and established biomarkers of Gaucher disease, including reduction of the bioactive lipid, glucosylsphingosine. These findings underscore the efficacy of eliglustat in treatment‐naïve patients. Eliglustat was well‐tolerated, and there were no new safety concerns with longer‐term exposure.
