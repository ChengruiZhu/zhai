The majority of the cellular energy currency ATP is formed in a tubular network, termed mitochondria, present within virtually all eukaryotic cells. The mitochondria are unique among cellular organelles in that they contain their own genome, which encodes critical proteins necessary for cellular energy production. However, the vast majority of mitochondrial proteins are encoded in the nucleus and imported into mitochondria. Gene expression thus needs to be coordinated between the two genomes to ensure efficient mitochondrial function and sufficient adaptation to different physiological demands. The regulation of the mitochondrial genome is poorly understood, with many of the basic regulators not yet being characterized. We used RNAi in the fruit fly to study the in vivo function of the bicoid stability factor (BSF), previously thought to be a cytoplasmic and nuclear protein important for fly development. We show here that BSF is mainly localized to mitochondria, where it is essential for mtDNA gene expression, regulating the polyadenylation and maturation of specific mRNAs. Furthermore, BSF coordinates the translation and assembly of mitochondrial peptides in the inner mitochondrial membrane.
