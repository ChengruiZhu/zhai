 The effects of an oral neomycin and penicillin regimen on intestinal bacteriology and on morphology and function of the small intestine of mice were investigated. Quantitative and qualitative stool cultures on selective media of the treated animals revealed only growth of yeast organisms. The treated animals developed enlargement of the ceca with fluid contents and watery stools, resembling characteristics of germfree animals. Radioautography with tritiated thymidine revealed an increased epithelial cell migration rate in the mice treated with the antibiotics for 3 to 5 wk. A slight increase in villus height was also noted. The treated male mice showed greater variance than the treated females in epithelial cell migration rates. Histochemical staining reactions showed a decrease in nonspecific esterase and in NADH dehydrogenase activity in the proximal gut of the antibiotic animals. Stains of distal gut and those for acid and alkaline phosphatase, NADPH dehydrogenase, lactic dehydrogenase, and succinic dehydrogenase were similar to the controls. A slight increase in sucrase activity and a slight decrease in lactase activity in the antibiotic animals was observed in contrast to control animals. Germfree mice, however, had greater sucrase and lactase activity. Transport of
