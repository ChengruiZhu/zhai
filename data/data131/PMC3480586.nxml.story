Zinc ions in the synaptic vesicles of zinc-enriched neurons (ZEN) seem to have an important role in normal physiological and pathophysiological processes in target organ innervation. The factor directly responsible for the transport of zinc ions into synaptic vesicles is zinc transporter 3 (ZnT3), a member of the divalent cation zinc transporters and an excellent marker of ZEN neurons. As data concerning the existence of ZEN neurons in the small intestine is lacking, this study was designed to disclose the presence and neurochemical coding of such neurons in the porcine jejunum. Cryostat sections (10 mÎ¼ thick) of porcine jejunum were processed for routine double- and triple-immunofluorescence labeling for ZnT3 in various combinations with immunolabeling for other neurochemicals including pan-neuronal marker (PGP9.5), substance P (SP), somatostatin (SOM), vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP), nitric oxide synthase (NOS), leu-enkephalin (LENK), vesicular acetylcholine transporter (VAChT), neuropeptide Y (NPY), galanin (GAL), and calcitonin-gene related peptide (CGRP). Immunohistochemistry revealed that approximately 39%, 49%, and 45% of all PGP9.5- positive neurons in the jejunal myenteric (MP), outer submucous (OSP), and inner submucous (ISP) plexuses, respectively, were simultaneously ZnT3
