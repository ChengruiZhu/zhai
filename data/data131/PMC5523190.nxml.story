COMSOL finite element software was used to establish a solid-liquid coupling biphasic model of articular cartilage and a microscopic model of chondrocytes, using modeling to take into account the shape and number of chondrocytes in cartilage lacuna in each layer. The effects of cyclic loading at different frequencies on the micromechanical environment of chondrocytes in different regions of the cartilage were studied. The results showed that low frequency loading can cause stress concentration of superficial chondrocytes. Moreover, along with increased frequency, the maximum value of stress response curve of chondrocytes decreased, while the minimum value increased. When the frequency was greater than 0.2â€‰Hz, the extreme value stress of response curve tended to be constant. Cyclic loading had a large influence on the distribution of liquid pressure in chondrocytes in the middle and deep layers. The concentration of fluid pressure changed alternately from intracellular to peripheral in the middle layer. Both the range of liquid pressure in the upper chondrocytes and the maximum value of liquid pressure in the lower chondrocytes in the same lacunae varied greatly in the deep layer. At the same loading frequency, the elastic modulus of artificial cartilage had little effect on the mechanical environment of chondrocytes.
