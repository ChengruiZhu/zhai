Integration of volumetric heart chamber quantification by 3D echocardiography into clinical practice has been hampered by several factors which a new fully automated algorithm (Left Heart Model, (LHM)) may help overcome. This study therefore aims to evaluate the feasibility and accuracy of the LHM software in quantifying left atrial and left ventricular volumes and left ventricular ejection fraction in a cohort of patients with a bicuspid aortic valve. Patients with a bicuspid aortic valve were prospectively included. All patients underwent 2D and 3D transthoracic echocardiography and computed tomography. Left atrial and ventricular volumes were obtained using the automated program, which did not require manual contour detection. For comparison manual and semi-automated measurements were performed using conventional 2D and 3D datasets. 53 patients were included, in four of those patients no 3D dataset could be acquired. Additionally, 12 patients were excluded based on poor imaging quality. Left ventricular end-diastolic and end-systolic volumes and ejection fraction calculated by the LHM correlated well with manual 2D and 3D measurements (Pearson’s r between 0.43 and 0.97, p < 0.05). Left atrial volume (LAV) also correlated significantly although LHM did estimate larger LAV compared to both 2DE and 3DE (Pearson’s r between 0.61 and 0.81, p < 0.01). The fully automated software works well in a real-world setting and helps to overcome some of the major hurdles in integrating 3D analysis into daily practice, as it is user-independent and highly reproducible in a group of patients with a clearly defined and well-studied valvular abnormality.
