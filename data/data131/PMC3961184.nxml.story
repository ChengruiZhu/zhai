 mosquitoes are increasingly resistant. It is important to manage insecticide application carefully to minimise increases in resistance, for example by using different compounds in combination or rotation. Recently, mosquitoes resistant to all available insecticides have been found in Tiassalé, West Africa, which could be problematic for resistance management, particularly if common genetic mechanisms are responsible (‘cross-resistance’). Tiassalé mosquitoes also exhibit extreme levels of resistance to the two most important classes, pyrethroids and carbamates. We investigated the genetic basis of extreme carbamate resistance and cross-resistance in Tiassalé, and the applicability of results in an additional population from Togo. We find that specific P450 enzymes are involved in both extreme and cross-resistance, including one, CYP6M2, which can cause resistance to three insecticide classes. However, amplification of a mutated version of the gene which codes for acetycholinesterase, the target site of both the carbamate and organophosphate insecticides, also plays an important role. Mechanisms involved in both extreme resistance and cross resistance are likely to be very resilient to insecticide management practices, and represent an alarming scenario for mosquito-targeted malaria control.
