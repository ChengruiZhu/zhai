Primates have evolved to transmit social information through their faces. Where and how the brain processes facial information received by the eyes we now understand quite well. Yet we do not know how this information is made available to other brain areas so that a face can evoke an emotion, activate the memory of a person, or draw attention. Here, to identify brain regions interacting with face areas, we performed whole-brain imaging in macaque monkeys, whose face-processing system we know best. We find that the core face-processing areas are connected to several other brain areas supporting socially, emotionally, and cognitively relevant functions. Together, they form an extended face-processing network, similar to what has been proposed for humans. This extended face-processing network intersects with a second large-scale network, the so-called “default mode network”, in a pattern stunningly similar to that in the human brain. This intersection identifies selectively those brain regions that implement the most high-level forms of social cognition, such as understanding others’ thoughts and feelings. Thus, the results of this novel approach to understanding the functional organization of the social brain point to a deep evolutionary heritage of human abilities for social cognition.
