) and fluorescent DNA molecules. The array is composed of 12 fluorescently silent non-specific nanoreceptors (2D-nps) and used for the identification of three radically different systems; five proteins, three types of live breast cancer cells and a structure-switching event of a macromolecule. The data matrices for each system were processed using Partial Least Squares (PLS) discriminant analysis. In all of the systems, the sensor array was able to identify each object or event as separate clusters with 95% confidence and without any overlap. Out of 15 unknown entities with unknown protein concentrations tested, 14 of them were predicted successfully with correct concentration. 8 breast cancer cell samples out of 9 unknown entities from three cell types were predicted correctly. During the assembly of each nanoprobe, the intrinsic non-covalent interactions between unmodified 2D nanoparticles and ssDNAs were exploited. The unmodified 2D materials offer remarkable simplicity in the layout and the use of ssDNAs as probes provides limitless possibilities because the natural interaction of a ssDNA and 2D surface can be fine-tuned with the nucleobase composition, oligonucleotide length and type of 2D nanomaterial. Therefore, the approach described here can be advanced and fine-tuned indefinitely for meeting a particular sensing criterion. Though we have only studied three distinct elements, this approach is universal enough to be applied to a wide-range of systems.
