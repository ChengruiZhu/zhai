Vascular neoplasms of the pancreas are extremely rare and usually manifest as symptomatic, cystic lesions. This study presents a case that includes the clinicopathologic information used to discriminate pancreatic hemangioma from other types of cystic lesion of the pancreas. A 40-year-old female visited hospital with a chief complaint of abdominal pain. The serum CEA and CA19-9 levels of the patient were within the normal limits. An abdominal computed tomography scan and magnetic resonance imaging showed a 100-mm mass lesion in the body and tail of the pancreas, and the tumor extended toward the retroperitoneum and surrounded the splenic vein. The lesion was subsequently resected. Macroscopically, it was a multiloculated cyst with intracystic hemorrhage. Microscopically, the lesion was composed of numerous, heterogeneous cysts lined by a flattened single layer of cells without significant atypia. Notably, numerous neoplastic vessels extended into the interlobular septa of the pancreas and surrounded the main pancreatic duct. Immunohistochemical analysis showed that the lining cells expressed CD31 and CD34. The lesion was diagnosed as adult pancreatic hemangioma. Surgical treatment may be required when a direct contact between the lesion and the pancreatic tissue is demonstrated using imaging.
