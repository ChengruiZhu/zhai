Eukaryotic cells grow and divide by progressing through carefully orchestrated stages of the cell cycle characterized by stage-specific patterns of gene expression, DNA replication, and scission. How stage-specific gene expression is coordinated with cell cycle progression is only partially understood. The phase known as G1 marks the initiation of the cell cycle (called START in yeast) and involves the coordinated expression of more than 200 genes regulated by two transcription factors, SBF and MBF. The activity of SBF and MBF is restrained by binding of the repressor protein Whi5 to the two transcription factors early in G1 phase. Phosphorylation of Whi5 by G1-specific forms of the cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) Cdc28 promotes dissociation of Whi5 from SBF and its export from the nucleus; this, in turn, releases SBF to activate G1-specific transcription. This G1 transcriptional circuit is analogous to that defined in mammals by the E2F family of transcription factors and the retinoblastoma (Rb) tumor suppressor protein. Rb further contributes to the repression of G1-specific transcription in mammals by recruiting histone deacetylases (HDACs), which are chromatin remodeling complexes that regulate promoter accessibility. Here, we show that regulation of G1-specific transcription in yeast also involves repressor-mediated recruitment of HDACs. We demonstrate that repression by Whi5 is modulated by both Cln-Cdc28 and a second G1-specific CDK, Pcl-Pho85, and further show that both kinases regulate the interaction of Whi5 with HDACs. We propose that regulation of the repressor by more than one G1-specific CDK ensures definitive inactivation of Whi5, a critical event for appropriate cell cycle initiation.
