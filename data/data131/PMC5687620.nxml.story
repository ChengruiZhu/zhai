Angiotensin (Ang) II, the main effector peptide of the renin-angiotensin system, has been implicated in multiple aspects of cancer progression such as proliferation, migration, invasion, angiogenesis and metastasis. Ang-(1-7), is a biologically active heptapeptide, generated predominantly from AngII by the enzymatic activity of angiotensin converting enzyme 2. Previous studies have shown that Ang-(1-7) counterbalances AngII actions in different pathophysiological settings. In this study, we have analysed the impact of Ang-(1-7) on AngII-induced pro-tumorigenic features on normal murine mammary epithelial cells NMuMG and breast cancer cells MDA-MB-231. AngII stimulated the activation of the survival factor AKT in NMuMG cells mainly through the AT1 receptor. This PI3K/AKT pathway activation also promoted epithelialâ€“mesenchymal transition (EMT). Concomitant treatment of NMuMG cells with AngII and Ang-(1-7) completely abolished EMT features induced by AngII. Furthermore, Ang-(1-7) abrogated AngII induced migration and invasion of the MDA-MB-231 cells as well as pro-angiogenic events such as the stimulation of MMP-9 activity and VEGF expression. Together, these results demonstrate for the first time that Ang-(1-7) counteracts tumor aggressive signals stimulated by AngII in breast cancer cells emerging the peptide as a potential therapy to prevent breast cancer progression.
