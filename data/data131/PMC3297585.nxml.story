In meiosis, the correct segregation of the homologous chromosomes is assured by the coordination of synapsis (a pairing mechanism) and repair of DNA double-strand breaks through homologous recombination. The sex chromosomes represent a challenge to the system, because they are largely comprised of non-homologous sequences. In mouse, the X and Y pair and recombine within a small region of homology. During pachytene, genes on the unsynapsed portions are repressed, a phenomenon called Meiotic Sex Chromosome Inactivation (MSCI). In chicken, the female is the heterogametic sex, i.e. has ZW sex chromosomes, while males are ZZ. In order to determine whether MSCI is conserved in this species, we analysed ZW synaptic behaviour and transcriptional activity. We found that ZW synapsis normally occurs through homologous and heterologous regions, and it is disassembled at diplotene (the stage following pachytene). A high number of oocytes fail to achieve ZW synapsis and recombination, but are nevertheless carried over to diplotene. We did not find evidence of MSCI. We favour a model whereby the sex chromosomes and the autosomes undergo transcriptional downregulation at the beginning of meiosis, which is maintained into diplotene. These data raise questions about checkpoint controls and have repercussions on theories of MSCI evolution.
