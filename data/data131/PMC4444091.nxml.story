For this study, the researchers used a food frequency questionnaire that was designed to capture foods commonly consumed in the southeastern US, and from this calculated HEI-2010 scores for each participant. They also collected other health- and lifestyle-related information. They then followed all participants for whom they had complete information (over 77,000) for a number of years (half of them for over 6.2 years). During that period, 6,906 participants died; including 2,244 from cardiovascular disease, 1,794 from cancer, and 2,550 from other diseases. When the researchers tested for a possible association between HEI-2010 and death (controlling for other relevant factors such as age, weight, exercise, smoking, and the presence of specific chronic diseases), they found that participants with a higher HEI-2010 score (reflecting better adherence to the DGA) had a lower risk of dying in the follow-up period. Participants with the healthiest diet (those in the top one-fifth of HEI-2010 scores) had only about 80% of the risk of death of those with the unhealthiest diets (those in the bottom one-fifth of HEI-2010 scores). This reduction in the risk of death by approximately 20% was true for death from any disease, death from cancer, and death from cardiovascular disease.
