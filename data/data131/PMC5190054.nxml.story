 polymorphisms and breast cancer (BC) remains uncertain. In this study, a total of 560 BC patients and 583 age, sex, and ethnicity-matched healthy controls from Northwest China were included. The polymorphisms were genotyped using Sequenom MassARRAY. The expression level of TIM-3 protein was detected by immunohistochemistry. We observed rs10053538 had a significantly increased risk of BC, comparing with the wild-type genotype even after Bonferroni correction. In addition, the rs4704853 G>A variants were more frequent among BC patients than the controls (GA + AA vs. GG: OR = 1.32, 95% CI = 1.03-1.69, P = 0.026); However, the significance was lost after Bonferroni correction (P = 0.078). Furthermore, rs10053538 was associated with lymph node metastasis. Age stratification revealed that among patients aged <49 years, those with the rs4704853 GA/AA genotype had a higher risk of BC; But there was no difference when Bonferroni correction was conducted. Immunohistochemical analysis showed that the expression of TIM-3 protein in the breast cancer tissues was higher in patients carrying the rs10053538 GT+TT genotype than those with GG genotype (P = 0.012). However, we failed to find any difference between BC patients and controls in any rs1036199 genetic model. These findings suggested that rs10053538 in
