The prognostic role of epithelial cadherin (E-cadherin) downregulation in ovarian cancer has been assessed for years while the results remain inconclusive. The aim of our study was to assess this issue. Eligible studies were identified through searches of PubMed, EMBASE and Cochrane Database. In total, 1562 patients from 17 studies were included to assess the association between E-cadherin expression and overall survival/progression-free survival and clinicopathological characteristics of ovarian cancer patients. Hazard ratios (HRs) or odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence interval (95% CI) were calculated to estimate the effect. The quality of 17 studies was evaluated using the Newcastle Ottawa Quality Assessment Scale. We also performed subgroup analysis, publication bias and sensitivity analysis in this meta-analysis. The results showed that negative E-cadherin expression significantly predicted poor overall survival of ovarian cancer patients (HR = 1.90, 95% CI = 1.50–2.40). However, negative E-cadherin was not associated with poor progression-free survival (HR = 1.19, 95% CI = 0.86–1.64). Moreover, Negative E-cadherin expression was distinctly associated with FIGO stage (OR = 0.42, 95% CI = 0.31–0.57), tumor grade (OR = 0.48, 95% CI = 0.34–0.67), metastasis (OR = 0.13, 95% CI = 0.07–0.26) and recurrence (OR = 0.48, 95% CI = 0.29–0.79). This meta-analysis revealed that negative E-cadherin expression might be a predicative factor of poor prognosis in ovarian cancer patients.
