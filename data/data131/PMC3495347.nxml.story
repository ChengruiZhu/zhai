The survival of transplant recipients is significantly lower than age-matched controls in the general population. The aim of this study was to analyze the trends in mortality of renal allograft recipients at our centre. We retrospectively analyzed data from all patients who were transplanted between October 1988 and June 2010 and were followed at our center. Patients were considered to have death with graft function (DWGF) if death was not preceded by return to dialysis or re-transplantation. The study included 98 renal allograft recipients (male : female – 7.99 : 1). The mean recipient and donor ages were 35.06 ± 11.84 (range: 15–69) and 41.17 ± 10.44 (range: 22–60) years, respectively. Basic kidney diseases were CGN (chronic glomerulonephritis) (60.20%), CIN (chronic interstitial nephritis) (15.31%), DN (diabetic nephropathy) (8.16%), ADPKD (autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease) (2.04%) and others (14.29%). They were followed up for a mean 79.91 ± 60.05 patient-months. Mortality occurred in 25 (25.51%) patients (male : female – 4 : 1). Causes of death were sepsis/infection (36%), coronary artery disease (28%), CVA (8%), failed graft (4%), and rest unknown (24%). DWGF was 88% of total death and contributed to 78.57% of total graft loss. Overall patient survival at 1, 5, 10, and 15 years were 90.8%, 80.2%, 65.6%, and 59.1%, respectively (Kaplan–Meier analysis). Those who died exhibited significant differences in recipient's age (median 40 years
