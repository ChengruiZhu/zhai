The circadian clock is the biological clock found throughout the body that coordinates the timing of molecular and cellular processes on a 24-hour rhythm. It is composed of numerous transcription factors that feed back and control their own expression. To explore how the clock functions in the face of genetic perturbations, we disrupted its function by knocking down gene expression of known clock genes in a dose-dependent fashion. We measured the expression of clock genes following knockdown and constructed perturbation-based network models to describe, visualize, and mine the results. We reported several novel network features, such as signal propagation through interacting genetic modules and proportional responses whereby levels of expression are altered commensurately with changing levels of the gene. We also observed several examples where a gene is up-regulated following knockdown of its paralog, suggesting the clock network utilizes active compensatory mechanisms rather than simple redundancy to confer robustness and maintain function. We propose that the network features we observe act in concert as a genetic buffering system to maintain clock function in the face of genetic and environmental perturbation.
