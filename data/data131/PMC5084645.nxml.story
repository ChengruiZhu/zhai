Calcium signals in stimulated T cells are generally considered single entities that merely trigger immune responses, whereas costimulatory events specify the type of reaction. Here we show that the “T cell calcium signal” is a composite signal harboring two distinct components that antagonistically control genomic programs underlying the immune response. Using human T cells from healthy individuals, we establish nuclear calcium as a key signal in human T cell adaptogenomics that drives T cell activation and is required for signaling to cyclic adenosine monophosphate response element–binding protein and the induction of CD25, CD69, interleukin-2, and γ-interferon. In the absence of nuclear calcium signaling, cytosolic calcium activating nuclear factor of activated T cells translocation directed the genomic response toward enhanced expression of genes that negatively modulate T cell activation and are associated with a hyporesponsive state. Thus, nuclear calcium controls the T cell fate decision between a proliferative immune response and tolerance. Modulators of nuclear calcium–driven transcription may be used to develop a new type of pro-tolerance immunosuppressive therapy.
