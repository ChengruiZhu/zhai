Intravenous leiomyomatosis (IVL) is characterized by histologically benign tumors that exhibit aggressive clinical behavior. On rare occasions, the tumors may extend into the regional and systemic veins, thus reaching the heart. This may subsequently cause intracardiac leiomyomatosis (ICL), which may lead to congestive heart failure and occasionally, sudden fatalities. Due to its rarity and diffuse symptoms, the misdiagnosis of ICL is common and as a result, the condition may be under-reported. The present study reports a 33-year-old female who was admitted to Shandong Provincial Hospital Affiliated to Shandong University for myomectomy due to a rapidly growing myoma of the uterus. In routine pre-operative abdominal ultrasonography, a moderately sized echoic mass in the right internal iliac vein was observed, which extended to the common iliac vein, the inferior vena cava and the orifice of the right atrium. A presumptive diagnosis of ICL was made. The patient underwent a well-prepared one-stage thoraco-abdominal surgical procedure and the pathological report confirmed ICL. This case illustrates that the early detection of ICL may prevent a potential emergency situation and abdominal ultrasonography may be considered a useful tool in the diagnosis of ICL.
