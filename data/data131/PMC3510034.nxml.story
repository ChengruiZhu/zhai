Epilepsy is a devastating brain disorder whereby a loss of regulation of electrochemical signals between neurons causes too much excitation and ultimately results in an “electrical storm” known as a seizure. Epilepsy can be heritable, but it is usually genetically complex, resulting from a collaboration of many genes. It is also a frequent feature of other common brain diseases, such as autism spectrum disorder and intellectual disability, likely because these diseases have a similar dysregulation of neuronal communication. To understand more about how the brain regulates electrical activity, we focused on an RNA–binding protein called CELF4, because a) mice that lack CELF4 have a complex form of epilepsy that includes features of other neurological diseases and b) this kind of protein has the potential to be a master regulator. We show that CELF4 binds to a vast array of mRNAs, and without CELF4 these mRNAs accumulate in the wrong places and can produce the wrong amount of protein. Moreover, many of these mRNAs encode key players in electrochemical signaling between neurons. Although the defects in individual mRNAs are modest, like a genetically complex disease, together these alterations collude to cause neurological symptoms including recurrent seizures.
