Evolution is often viewed as a process that occurs “mutation by mutation”, suggesting that the effect of each mutation is independent of that of others. However, in reality the effect of a mutation often depends on the context of other mutations, a dependence known as “epistasis”. Even though epistasis can constrain protein evolution, it is actually very common. Such interactions are particularly pervasive in proteins that evolve resistance to a drug via mutations that create defects, and that must be repaired with compensatory mutations. We study how epistasis between protein residues evolves over time in a new and changing environment, and compare these findings to protein evolution in a constant environment. We analyze the sequences of the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) protease enzyme collected over a period of 9 years from patients treated with anti-viral drugs (as well as from patients that went untreated), and find that epistasis between residues continues to increase as more potent anti-viral drugs enter the market, while epistasis is unchanging in the proteins exposed to a constant environment. Yet, the proteins adapting to the changing landscape do not appear to be constrained by the epistatic interactions and continue to manage to evade new drugs.
