The protein folding process, in which a linear chain of amino acids reaches its biologically active three-dimensional shape, is fundamental to life. Small “ultrafast” folders, proteins that fold in microseconds, have received considerable attention, because these proteins serve as model systems for the folding of larger proteins, and thus permit a testing of the accuracy of computational models as well as an assessment of protein folding theories. FSD-1, a designed small ultrafast folder with a ββα fold, has been actively studied in the last few years as a model system for mixed α/β fold proteins. The suitability of this protein to describe the folding of naturally occurring proteins has however recently been challenged based on the observation that the melting transition is very broad, with ill-resolved baselines. Prior simulations have not been successful in providing an interpretation of this broad melting transition. In the present study, our extensive molecular dynamics simulations using the AMBER protein force field (ff96) coupled with the implicit solvent model (IGB = 5) shed new light on the nature of the folding transition of this protein, as well as reveal the strengths and weaknesses of the force field in predicting the thermodynamics and kinetics of folding.
