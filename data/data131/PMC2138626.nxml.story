 Irradiated rabbits given allogeneic bone marrow cells from normal adult donors responded to an injection of sheep red blood cells by forming circulating antibodies. Their spleen cells were also capable of forming many plaques using the hemolysis in gel technique, and were also capable of undergoing blastogenesis and mitosis and of incorporating tritiated thymidine upon exposure to the specific antigen in vitro. However, irradiated rabbits injected with allogeneic bone marrow obtained from rabbits injected with sheep red blood cells 24 hr prior to sacrifice (primed donors) were incapable of mounting an immune response after stimulation with sheep red cells. This loss of reactivity by the bone marrow from primed donors is specific for the antigen injected, since the immune response of the irradiated recipients to a non-cross-reacting antigen, the horse red blood cell, is unimpaired. Treatment of the bone marrow donors with high-titered specific antiserum to sheep red cells for 24 hr prior to sacrifice did not result in any diminished ability of their bone marrow cells to transfer antibody-forming capacity to sheep red blood cells. The significance of these results, with respect to the origin of the antigen-reactive and antibody-forming cells in the rabbit, is discussed.
