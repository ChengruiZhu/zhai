Skin cancers are by far the most common human malignancies. Retinoids have shown promising preventive and therapeutic effects against a variety of human malignancies. The aim of this study was to investigate the apoptosis-inducing effect of acitretin on human skin squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) SCL-1 cells. We found that acitretin preferentially inhibited the growth of SCL-1 cells in a dose- and time-dependent manner, but not of non-malignant keratinocyte HaCaT cells. This inhibition appeared to be due to induction of apoptosis as revealed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. AnnexinV/propidium iodide assay and morphological observation confirmed the pro-apoptotic effect of acitretin on SCL-1 cells. We further demonstrated that apoptosis was induced within 1â€“2 days and involved activation of caspases-8, -9, -3 and poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP). Caspase-8 inhibitor effectively suppressed acitretin-induced apoptosis whereas caspase-9 inhibitor did not. Acitretin increased the levels of CD95 (Fas), CD95-ligand and Fas-associated death domain. Neutralizing ZB4 anti-Fas antibody significantly inhibited the apoptosis in SCL-1 cells induced by acitretin. These results suggest that acitretin is able to induce apoptosis in skin cancer cells possibly
