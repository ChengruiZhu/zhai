Real-time cell analysis (RTCA) system based on measurement of electrical microimpedance has been introduced to monitor adherent cell cultures. We describe its use for real-time analysis of hematopoietic cell adhesion to bone marrow stroma proteins. Cells growing in suspension do not generate any significant change in the microimpedance signal until the surface with embedded microelectrodes is coated with a cell-binding protein. We show that in this case, the microimpedance signal specifically reflects cell binding to the coated surface. The optimized method was used to monitor the effect of two histone deacetylase inhibitors, suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid (SAHA) and tubastatin A, on JURL-MK1 cell adhesion to cell-binding fragment of fibronectin (FNF). Both compounds were used in non-toxic concentrations and induced an increase in the cell adhesivity. The kinetics of this increase was markedly slower for SAHA although tubulin hyperacetylation occurred rapidly for any of the two drugs. The strengthening of cell binding to FNF was paralleled with a decrease of Lyn kinase activity monitored using an anti-phospho-Src family antibody. The inhibition of Src kinase activity with PP2 accordingly enhanced JURL-MK1 cell interaction with FNF. Actin filaments were present at the proximity of the plasma membrane and in numerous membrane protrusions. In some cells, F-actin formed clusters at membrane regions interacting with the coated surface and these clusters colocalized with active Lyn kinase. Our results indicate that the role of Src kinases in the regulation of hematopoetic cell adhesion signaling is similar to that of c-Src in adherent cells.
