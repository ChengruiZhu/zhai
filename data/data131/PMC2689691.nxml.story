The function of the RNA genome of the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is determined both by its sequence and by its ability to fold back on itself to form specific higher-order structures. In order to describe physical structures in a region of the HIV RNA genome known to play multiple, critical roles in viral replication and pathogenesis, we invent a high-throughput, quantitative, and comprehensive structure-mapping approach that locates flexible (unpaired) nucleotides within a folded RNA, assaying hundreds of nucleotides at a time. We find that the first 10% of the HIV-1 genome has a single predominant structure and that regulatory motifs have significantly greater structure than do protein-coding segments. The HIV genome interacts with numerous proteins, including multiple copies of the nucleocapsid protein. We directly map RNA–protein interactions inside virions and discover that the nucleocapsid prottein interacts with viral RNA in at least three distinct ways, depending on the context within the overall genome structure. Further application of the high-throughput RNA-structure analysis tools described here will make it possible to address diverse structure–function relationships in intact cellular and viral RNAs.
