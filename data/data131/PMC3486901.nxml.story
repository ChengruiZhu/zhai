Mitochondria control energy production, initiation of cell death and several other critical cellular processes. Most often, they form a constantly reshaping tubular reticulum spread over the cytosol. Despite extensive knowledge of mitochondrial physiology, accurate description of their large-scale architecture is missing, partly due to substantial variability of reticulum geometries found in different cell types, and a capability for fast radical changes. We address this shortcoming with a mathematical model representing the organelle as a cell-wide dynamical network subjected to opposing actions of fission and internal fusion â€“ processes known experimentally but not yet accurately specified. This opens a way for the quantitative characterization of the large-scale organization by showing how particular types of the internal dynamics can shape the reticulum into the whole multitude of configurations observed in biological studies. Further analysis reveals that for a specific value of tip-to-side fission/fusion rates the network should undergo a radical reorganization. Because of the high morphological sensitivity to minute changes in fusion or fission rates close to the critical point, cells can quickly adapt the mitochondrial operation and structure to their actual needs at a low expenditure of energy.
