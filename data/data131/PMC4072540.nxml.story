Mammalian spermatogenesis takes place within a sheltered environment, whereby somatic Sertoli cells protect and guide germ cells as they mature and differentiate. A key structure generated by the protective Sertoli cell epithelium is the blood-testis barrier (BTB), a composite of junctional and cytoskeletal elements, which prevents exposure of post-meiotic spermatids to the immune system. The BTB is a highly dynamic structure, which needs to be dismantled and rapidly rebuilt, in order to allow passage of maturing preleptotene spermatocytes, without compromising their isolation. Here we show that N-WASP, a conserved facilitator of formation of branched actin microfilament arrays, provides a function that is essential for maintenance of an intact BTB. Genetic disruption of N-WASP in mouse Sertoli cells leads to loss of BTB impermeability, resulting in a complete arrest of spermatogenesis at early and post-meiotic stages. Based on the localization patterns of key elements, we propose that branched-actin filaments participate in recycling of BTB materials to ensure the dynamic and efficient maintenance of this structure, one of a series of blood-tissue barriers that preserve privileged organ environments.
