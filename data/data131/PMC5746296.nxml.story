Adipose-tissue derived mesenchymal stem cell (ADSC)-based therapy is a promising option for patients with atherosclerotic conditions, including coronary artery disease. However, the potential differences in the metabolic characteristics between bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs) and ADSCs have remained to be fully elucidated. The present study aimed to compare the metabolic profiles of BMSCs and ADSCs via liquid chromatography quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry. BMSCs and ADSCs obtained from elderly coronary heart disease patients were cultured, and after three passages, supernatants of each cell type were collected and systematically analysed. Substantial differences were detected between the metabolite signatures of ADSCs and BMSCs. In addition, further analysis using partial least-squares discriminant analysis score plots indicated significant differences between the supernatants of the two cell types. The following metabolites were deemed to be responsible for the potential differences in the metabolic characteristics of BMSCs and ADSCs: D-lactic acid, hydroxyindoleacetaldehyde, α-D-glucose, bovinic acid, 9,10-epoxyoctadecenoic acid, glyceraldehyde, phenylpyruvic acid, L-octanoylcarnitine, retinyl ester, α-ketoisovaleric acid, guanidoacetic acid, N-acetylneuraminic acid, imidazoleacetic acid riboside, sphingosine and pseudouridine 5′-phosphate. Based on these findings, there may be significant differences in the following metabolic pathways: The linoleic acid metabolic pathway, galactose metabolism, argentines and proline metabolism, retinol metabolism, glycine and serine metabolism, galactose metabolism, and amino sugar and nucleotide sugar metabolism. In conclusion, substantial differences in metabolic characteristics were detected between BMSCs and ADSCs, which may be associated with the different efficacies of atherosclerosis therapies employing these cell types.
