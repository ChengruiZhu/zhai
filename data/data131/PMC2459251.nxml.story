To elucidate the radiosensitivity of an acatalasemic mouse, we examined the time and dose-dependency in the survival rates, the lymphocytes and the intestinal epithelial cells, and the antioxidant function after 3.0 to 12.0 Gy whole body irradiation. Results showed that no significant differences between acatalasemic mice and normal mice were observed in the survival rates and the histological changes in spleens and small intestine after each irradiation. The catalase activities in livers and spleens of acatalasemic mice were significantly lower than those of normal mice and the glutathione peroxidase activity in livers of acatalasemic mice was significantly higher than that of normal mice. At 10 days after 6.0 Gy irradiation, the catalase activities in livers of acatalasemic and normal mice and that in spleens of normal mice significantly decreased compared with no-irradiation control, and there were no differences between those catalase activities. The total glutathione content in acatalasemic mice was significantly higher than that in normal mice at 10 days after 6.0 Gy irradiation. These findings suggested that the radiosensitivity of acatalasemic mice in terms of whole body irradiation doesn’t significantly differ from that of normal mice, probably due to compensated sufficient contents of glutathione peroxidase and total glutathione in acatalasemic mice.
