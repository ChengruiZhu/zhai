Mammalian B cells have developed complex processes to create genetic diversity from DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs). These must be tightly controlled to avoid harmful chromosomal translocations. Here we report an experimental yeast assay to analyze how the B-cell specific Activation Induced Deaminase (AID) induces transcription-dependent DSBs in mammalian DNA sequences. Our data suggest that in yeast AID is able to mediate deamination of cytosines in transcribed DNA that are then channeled into DSBs as it occurs in mammalian B cells, leading finally to reciprocal chromosomal translocations. These events are strongly enhanced in THO yeast mutants, which indicates that the impairment of the mRNP biogenesis may generate the appropriate substrates for AID action. Our study demonstrates that the AID–dependent genomic instability mechanisms are mediated by standard DNA repair functions existing from yeast to human cells. The only requirement for these events to occur is the formation of the appropriate substrates for AID action, as they are the transcription-mediated RNA–DNA hybrids known to be accumulated in THO null mutants. This experimental model provides a useful tool for the study of the sequences and the mechanisms leading to genomic instability that are primarily caused by chromosomal rearrangements.
