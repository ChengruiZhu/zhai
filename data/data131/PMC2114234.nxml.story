Flagellates of Naegleria gruberi contain two calmodulins that differ in apparent molecular weight and intracellular location. Calmodulin-1, localized in flagella, has an apparent molecular weight of approximately 16,000, approximately the size of other protozoan calmodulins, whereas calmodulin-2, localized in cell bodies, is 15,300. Both proteins, purified, are calmodulins by several criteria, including Ca2+-dependent stimulation of calmodulin-dependent cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterase and affinity for antibodies to vertebrate calmodulin. The finding of two calmodulins is unusual. Since the only known difference is apparent molecular weight, one calmodulin could be derived from the other, except that both calmodulins are synthesized in a wheat germ, cell-free system directed by RNA from differentiating Naegleria. Translatable mRNAs encoding calmodulins 1 and 2, not detected in amebas, appear and subsequently disappear concurrently during the 100-min differentiation of Naegleria from amebas to flagellates. Furthermore, these mRNAs increase and then decrease in abundance concurrently with those for flagellar tubulins, which suggests the possibility that the expression of the unrelated genes for calmodulin and tubulin may be under coordinate control during differentiation.
