Sequencing based technologies provide global snapshots of transcriptional regulation. These data promise insights into gene regulation, disease susceptibility and organismal evolution. They also provide a methodological challenge in distilling specific hypotheses from large masses of data. Most work to date has focused on deriving broad biochemical insights. Here we obtain the active enhancer landscape of the dorsal cerebral wall during early neocortical development. We show that our set likely contains enhancers from both the developing neocortex, the ventricular, subventricular and intermediate zones, and develop methods to separate this mass into subsets of interest in particular contexts. We discover novel enhancers next to key neocortex development genes. We show that some known key and novel genes are regulated by dozens of enhancers each, and find known and novel enriched binding sites for key transcription factors in our set. Nearly all newly discovered enhancers are conserved in human. A quarter of loci are shared with non-mammalian vertebrates. We show that the human and zebrafish orthologs of our enhancers mostly drive expression in related nervous system contexts. We also show that particular interspersed repeats were preferentially co-opted into potentially key neocortex development enhancers.
