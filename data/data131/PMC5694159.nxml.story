The purpose of the study has been making the orthodontic space maintainers in PEEK polymer (Polyetheretherketone) through a digital workflow. New digital technologies are taking hold in diagnosis, therapy and in dental laboratories. The digital world can help dentist in diagnosis and therapy: -diagnosis through the acquisition of radiographic images (CBCT) or scanners which allow the creation of 3D digital models â€“ about therapy thanks to dental CAD CAM system. It consists of design devices through an dedicated software CAD and then realize devices through CAM system. We used digital system to improve the quality of the treatment and reduce costs. Peek polymer, subject of studies in recent years, thanking to its characteristics, resulted useful for this study. According to a nine month- follow up the devices were found comfortable, satisfying, personalized and minimally visible for the patients. These devices were found suitable to maintain the space. About material, thanks to its dimensional stability, mechanical strength but specially, thanks to its biocompatibility, PEEK was found as a very good material to build space maintainers. The workflow allowed a simulation of the treatment plan with a better collaboration and acceptance of the patient. Digital system reduced the systematic mistakes during the various phases and the production time. The digital system saved space creating a virtual plaster casts collection.
