The aim of this work study was to evaluate the cytophysiological activity of equine adipose-derived stem cells (ASCs) cultured under conditions of static magnetic field. Investigated cells were exposed to a static magnetic field (MF) with the intensity of 0.5 T. In order to investigate the effects of magnetic field on stem cell signaling, the localization and density and content of microvesicles (MVs) as well as morphology, ultrastructure, and proliferation rate of equine ASCs were evaluated. Results showed that potential of equine adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells was accelerated when magnetic field was applied. Resazurin-based assay indicated that the cells cultured in the magnetic field reached the population doubling time earlier and colony-forming potential of equine ASCs was higher when cells were cultured under magnetic field conditions. Morphological and ultrastructural examination of equine ASCs showed that the exposure to magnetic field did not cause any significant changes in cell morphology whereas the polarity of the cells was observed under the magnetic field conditions in ultrastructural examinations. Exposition to MF resulted in a considerable increase in the number of secreted MVs—we have clearly observed the differences between the numbers of MVs shed from the cells cultured under MF in comparison to the control culture and were rich in growth factors. Microvesicles derived from ASCs cultured in the MF condition might be utilized in the stem cell-based treatment of equine musculoskeletal disorders and tendon injuries.
