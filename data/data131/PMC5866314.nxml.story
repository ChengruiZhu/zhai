 from January 2005 to June 2015. Detailed phenotypic characterization, including peak left ventricular outflow tract pressure gradients at rest and after provocation, was measured by echocardiography. The primary outcome was a composite cardiovascular end point, which included new‐onset atrial fibrillation, new sustained ventricular tachycardia/ventricular fibrillation, new or worsening heart failure, and death. The mean follow‐up was 3.4±2.8 years. Among the 705 patients with HCM (mean age, 52±15 years; 62% men), 230 with obstructive HCM were older and had a higher body mass index and New York Heart Association class. The 214 patients with nonobstructive HCM were more likely to have a history of sustained ventricular tachycardia/ventricular fibrillation and implantable cardioverter defibrillator implantation. During follow‐up, 121 patients experienced a composite cardiovascular end point. Atrial fibrillation occurred most frequently in the obstructive group. Patients with nonobstructive HCM had more frequent sustained ventricular tachycardia/ventricular fibrillation events. In multivariate analysis, obstructive (hazard ratio, 2.80; 95% confidence interval, 1.64–4.80) and nonobstructive (hazard ratio, 1.94; 95% confidence interval, 1.09–3.45) HCM were associated with more adverse events compared with labile
