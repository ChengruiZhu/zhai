 culture, increasing the probability of genetic instability and transformation. We examine here the incidence of unbalanced and balanced chromosome rearrangements in polyclonal and single cell-derived cultures of human adipose stem cells to senescence. G-banding karyotyping of the polyclonal cultures shows a normal karyotype. In addition, high-resolution microarray-based comparative genomic hybridization analyses relative to uncultured adipose stem cells from the same donors reveal overall genomic stability in long-term (âˆ¼6 months) polyclonal and clonal culture. One adipose stem cell clone displayed minor deletions in gene-rich telomeric and sub-telomeric regions on three chromosomes in early passage. This however, was detected only in a sub-population of cells that was subsequently spontaneously eliminated from the culture. Apparent pericentromeric instabilities are also occasionally detected in specific chromosomes. Our results indicate that clonal chromosomal aberrations may arise transiently in early passage adipose stem cells (ASC) cultures. Nonetheless, incidence of these aberrations seems to be negligible in the majority of long-term ASC cultures, at least under the culture conditions used here.
