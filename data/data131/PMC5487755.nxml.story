 = 86) aged 4 to 11 years and their parents received PMTO and were assessed at four time points: at baseline, and after 6, 12, and 18 months. Difference scores between baseline and follow-up assessments of externalizing behavior problems, parenting practices, and parental psychopathology and parents' overall ratings of working alliance, were correlated with treatment fidelity scores measured prior to the intervention. Furthermore, differences in therapists' fidelity scores between treatment completers and drop-outs were examined. Results showed that higher fidelity scores of PMTO therapists during initial training were associated with larger improvements in externalizing behavior, parenting practices, and parental psychopathology, especially after 18 months. In addition, parents who completed the treatment had a significantly more adherent therapist than families who dropped out. However, the correlations between treatment fidelity and working alliance were non-significant. These findings indicate that therapists' high adherence to the PMTO treatment principles during initial training decreases the chance of treatment drop-out and positively affects the longterm effectiveness of PMTO.
