Memories are not exact representations of the past. But can we say that all our senses are equally reliable (or unreliable) sources for memory? We performed a series of experiments to test that proposition. Sound and light are processed by different receptors and neural pathways in the brain. Previous comparisons of auditory and visual memory have done little to place on equal footing the stimuli that will be remembered, limiting the ability to truly compare the two processes. However, using current knowledge of how these sensations are represented in the nervous system, we created auditory and visual stimuli of similar complexity and that undergo similar initial processing by the nervous system. We then used these well-matched stimuli to examine memory for studied lists of either auditory or visual items. Using behavioral measures and a computational model for list memory, we show that memory representations are altered similarly for both hearing and vision. We found that auditory and visual memory exhibit striking parallels in terms of how memory is affected by all the parameters we changed in this experiment. These results imply that auditory and visual short-term memory employ similar mechanisms.
