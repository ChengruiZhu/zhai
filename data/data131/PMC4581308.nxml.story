Migration and chondrogenesis of human subchondral cortico-spongious progenitor cells (SPCs) are the key steps in the repair of microfracture-induced articular cartilage defects. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of human plasma-derived fibronectin (Fn) on the chondrogenic differentiation of SPCs, which was isolated from subchondrol cortico-spongious bone of late-stage osteoarthritis (OA) patients. SPCs were isolated and cultured for three passages. Stem cell surface antigens of SPCs were analyzed by flow cytometry. The osteogenic, chondrogenic and adipogenic differentiation potential were detected by histological staining. The chondrogenesis potential of SPCs with or without stimulation of either Fn or BMP-2 were studied by immunochemical staining and gene expression analysis. Cells isolated from subchondral bone presented to be positive for CD44, CD73, CD90, and CD166, and showed high capacity of osteogenic, adipogenic and chondrogenic differentiation, which suggested this cell population to be MSC-like cells. Stimulating with Fn increased the expression of SOX-9, aggrecan, collagen II while decreased the formation of collagen I by immunochemical staining. Gene expression analysis showed similar results. These results suggest that plasma-derived Fn can increase the chondrogenic differentiation of SPCs isolated from late-stage OA and improve cartilage repair after microfracture.
