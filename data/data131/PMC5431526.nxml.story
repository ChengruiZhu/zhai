DNA-binding protein inhibitor ID-1 (ID1) serves an essential role in tumor progression, and the self-renewal and pluripotency of embryonic stem cells. However, the effect of ID1 on the stemness and cancer stem cell (CSC)-like properties of gastric adenocarcinoma cells remains to be elucidated. In the present study, effective ID1 knockdown was achieved in gastric cancer (GC) cells using small interfering RNA, and the self-renewal ability and cisplatin (DDP) sensitivity of GC cells was subsequently examined. ID1 knockdown in the MKN-28 and MGC-803 cell lines was demonstrated to significantly suppress colony formation (P=0.005 in MKN-28 and P=0.001 in MGC-803), tumor spheroid formation (P=0.021 in MKN-28 and P=0.037 in MGC-803), cell proliferation (P=0.028 in MKN-28 and P=0.001 in MGC-803) and migration (P=0.002 in MKN-28 and P=0.015 in MGC-803). To the best of our knowledge, the present study revealed for the first time that ID1 knockdown suppresses the expression of the key CSC-associated factors Nanog and octamer-binding protein 4 (Oct-4). It was further demonstrated that ID1 knockdown sensitized GC cells to DDP. In conclusion, knockdown of ID1 attenuates the stem cell like-properties of self-renewal in normal GC cells, potentially through the targeting of Nanog and Oct-4, and subsequently decreases cell proliferation and resistance to DDP. The results of the present study suggest that ID1 functions as an oncogene in GC and regulates the stem cell like-properties of gastric cancer cells by targeting Nanog and Oct-4.
