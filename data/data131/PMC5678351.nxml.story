This study sought to investigate osteosarcoma property changes after neoadjuvant chemotherapy and to analyze any correlation between changes with phospho-AKT (p-AKT) and heat shock protein 70 (HSP70) expression in osteosarcoma cells. Thirty patients with osteosarcoma treated at Liaocheng People's Hospital between January and October, 2016 were given an imaging examination before and after neoadjuvant chemotherapy to examine osteosarcoma tumor properties, with images scored. Immunohistochemistry was used to determine p-AKT and HSP70 expression levels, as well as tumor cell necrosis rate (TCNR), in specimens obtained before and after chemotherapy. The correlation between the imaging changes of osteosarcoma after chemotherapy and the expressions of p-AKT and HSP70 in tumor cells. Compared with pre-chemotherapy, the imaging scores of the 30 patients significantly increased after chemotherapy (P<0.05). The radiographic score of the TCNR ≥90% group was 11.3±0.5, which was significantly higher than that of the TCNR <90% group (8.7±0.3, P<0.05). p-AKT expression in osteosarcoma cells was found in 13.3% of samples (4/30 cases) after chemotherapy, which was significantly lower than prior to chemotherapy (73.3%, 22/30 cases, P<0.05). After chemotherapy, HSP70 expression in osteosarcoma cells was found in 6.7% of samples (2/30 cases), which was significantly lower than prior to chemotherapy (83.3%, 25/30 cases, P<0.05). p-AKT and HSP70 expression levels were found to be correlated with TCNR after chemotherapy (P<0.05). After chemotherapy, p-AKT and HSP70 expression levels demonstrated a positive correlation with TCNR. Tumor property changes, as uncovered by imaging, were significantly inversely correlated with tumor cell p-AKT and HSP70 expression after chemotherapy. Therefore, osteosarcoma properties, as determined through X-ray imaging, were closely related to p-AKT and HSP70 expression in osteosarcoma cells after neoadjuvant chemotherapy. The effect of chemotherapy can be evaluated by observing the above examination results.
