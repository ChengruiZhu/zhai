It illustrates the immense diversity among European countries in their approaches to address the rising burden of chronic disease. Approaches not only vary between but also within countries, and reflect to considerable degree the general approaches of health care financing and organisation taken. Thus, in many countries where strong primary care teams exist there has been a progressive shift in the management of many chronic diseases to nurse-led clinics in primary care, for example in England, Sweden and the Netherlands. The involvement of the non-medical profession in France or Germany is low, partly because of legal and professional restrictions on the deployment of nurses outside hospital. Instead, Germany has introduced dedicated disease management programmes which patients and providers can join voluntarily, while France is incentivising the formation of provider networks so as to improve coordination and multidisciplinary working along the continuum of care. The role of patient self-management is being acknowledged as a key component of effective chronic disease management in many countries; yet, systems that support self-management systematically remain relatively weak in many settings.
