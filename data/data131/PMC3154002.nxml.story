To gain insight into the effect of diabetes on fracture healing, experiments were carried out focusing on chondrocyte apoptosis during the transition from cartilage to bone. Type 1 diabetes was induced in mice by multiple low-dose streptozotocin injections, and simple transverse fractures of the tibia or femur was carried out. Large-scale transcriptional profiling and gene set enrichment analysis were performed to examine apoptotic pathways on total RNA isolated from fracture calluses on days 12, 16, and 22, a period of endochondral bone formation when cartilage is resorbed and chondrocyte numbers decrease. Tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α) protein levels were assessed by ELISA and caspase-3 by bioactivity assay. The role of TNF was examined by treating mice with the TNF-specific inhibitor pegsunercept. In vitro studies investigated the proapoptotic transcription factor FOXO1 in regulating TNF-induced apoptosis of chondrogenic ATDC5 and C3H10T1/2 cells as representative of differentiated chondrocytes, which are important during endochondral ossification. mRNA profiling revealed an upregulation of gene sets related to apoptosis in the diabetic group on day 16 when cartilage resorption is active but not day 12 or day 22. This coincided with elevated TNF-α protein levels, chondrocyte apoptosis, enhanced caspase-3 activity, and increased FOXO1 nuclear translocation (
