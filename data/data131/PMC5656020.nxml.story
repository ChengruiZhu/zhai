Limb sparing surgery in growing young patients with malignant tumors is difficult as invasion of the physis by the tumor or surgical resection through the metaphysis may cause significant limb discrepancy following surgery. At present, hinged tumor prosthesis or biological reconstructions are the main methods following tumor resection in these patients. The aim of the present study was to assess different procedures for the treatment of osteosarcoma around knee joints in immature patients. A retrospective study of 56 patients (<15 years old, open physis) who had been treated for osteosarcoma around the knee joint between January 2007 and December 2015 was performed. Clinical data collected included patient demographics (age at diagnosis, sex and date of diagnosis), tumor characteristics [location, Enneking stage and subtype on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)], treatment (response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy and type of primary surgery) and clinical outcomes (limb function, discrepancy and overall survival). The median age at the time of diagnosis was 12.14 years (range, 3–15 years). There were 32 male patients (57.1%). A total of 41 (82%) tumors were located at the distal femur, and 15 (18%) at the proximal tibia. A total of 49 (87.5%) patients were diagnosed with stage IIB tumors, and 7 (12.5%) had stage III, according to the Enneking stage classification. Different surgical methods, including amputation, rotation-plasty, endoprosthesis and biological instructions (e.g., allograft) were performed according to MRI type classification. During follow-up, 21 patients (37.5%) succumbed to disease. The Musculoskeletal Tumor Society score ranged from excellent to fair functional result. Recurrence (2 cases, 16.67%) and infection (2, cases, 16.67%) were the main complications following endoprosthesis replacement, while delayed union (12 cases, 57.14%) and fracture (3 cases, 14.29%) were the main causes for biological reconstructions. Limb-length discrepancy ranged from 0–10 cm in limb-saving surgery. The overall survival rate was 57.66% with different cohorts in Enneking stages IIB and III, with or without involvement of the physis and different cycles of chemotherapy. Results of the present study indicated that different limb saving surgeries, including epiphysis/physis preservation with biological construction in patients with MRI types I to III and endoprosthetic/osteoarticular reconstruction in patients with MRI types IV and V, are useful in the management of osteosarcoma in growing young patients with proper surgery indications, and knee joint function was maintained with acceptable complications including limb discrepancy, delayed union, infection, recurrence and fracture.
