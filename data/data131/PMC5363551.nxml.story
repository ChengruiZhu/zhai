In this study, the effect of properdistatin, a novel peptide derived from the thrombospondin 1 (TSP-1) domain of properdin, was investigated in three melanoma xenograft models with different TSP-1 expression. The tumors were grown in dorsal window chambers and were treated with 80 mg/kg/day properdistatin or vehicle. Morphological parameters of the tumor vasculature were assessed from high resolution transillumination images. Blood supply time (i.e., the time required for arterial blood to flow from a supplying artery to downstream microvessels) and plasma velocities were assessed from first-pass imaging movies recorded after a bolus of fluorescence-labeled dextran had been administered intravenously. Gene and protein expression of TSP-1 were assessed with quantitative PCR and immunohistochemistry, respectively. Properdistatin treatment inhibited angiogenesis in low TSP-1 expressing tumors but did not alter the vasculature in high TSP-1 expressing tumors. In low TSP-1 expressing tumors, properdistatin selectively removed small-diameter capillaries, but did not change the morphology of tumor arterioles or tumor venules. Properdistatin also reduced blood supply times and increased plasma velocities, implying that the treatment reduced the geometric resistance to blood flow and improved vascular function.
