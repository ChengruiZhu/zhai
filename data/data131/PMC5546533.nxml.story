Immune checkpoint blockade therapeutics, notably antibodies targeting the programmed death 1 (PD-1) receptor and its PD-L1 and PD-L2 ligands, are currently revolutionizing the treatment of cancer. For a sizeable fraction of patients with melanoma, lung, kidney and several other solid cancers, monoclonal antibodies that neutralize the interactions of the PD-1/PD-L1 complex allow the reconstitution of long-lasting antitumor immunity. In hematological malignancies this novel therapeutic strategy is far less documented, although promising clinical responses have been seen in refractory and relapsed Hodgkin lymphoma patients. This review describes our current knowledge of PD-1 and PD-L1 expression, as reported by immunohistochemical staining in both non-Hodgkin lymphoma cells and their surrounding immune cells. Here, we discuss the multiple intrinsic and extrinsic mechanisms by which both T and B cell lymphomas up-regulate the PD-1/PD-L1 axis, and review current knowledge about the prognostic significance of its immunohistochemical detection. This body of literature establishes the cell surface expression of PD-1/PD-L1 as a critical determinant for the identification of non-Hodgkin lymphoma patients eligible for immune checkpoint blockade therapies.
