A bromideâ€“modified silver electrode is reported, in the present study, to catalyze the redox reactions of metalloproteins. This study describes that the bromide ions show very good redox behavior with silver electrode. The cathodic and anodic peak potentials were related to the concentration of bromide ions involved in making bromide-modified silver electrode. The electrode reaction in the bromine solution was a diffusion-controlled process. Positive potential shift of the bromide ions was seen when different proteins were added to the solution using a silver electrode. New cathodic and anodic peaks were observed at different potential ranges for myoglobin, cytochrome c and catalase. A linearly increasing cathodic peak current of bromide ions was seen when the concentration of superoxide dismutase was increased in the test solution. However, no change for albumin was observed when its concentration was increased in the test solution. Present data proves our methodology as an easy-to-use analysis for comparing the redox potentials of different metalloproteins and differentiating the metallo-from non-metalloproteins. In this study, we introduced an interesting method for bio-electrochemical analyses.
