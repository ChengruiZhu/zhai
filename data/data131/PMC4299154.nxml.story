Congenital disease, major trauma, tumour resection and biphosphonate-related osteonecrosis can lead to partial, subtotal, or total loss of the mandibular bone. Minor defects can be easily reconstructed using bone grafts, whereas microvascular free tissue transfer may be unavoidable in the case of major bone loss or poor quality of soft tissue. Simple bone or composite osteocutaneous fibula free flaps have proven invaluable and remain the workhorse for microvascular mandibular reconstruction in daily practice. Our experience with 99 consecutive fibular free flaps confirms the available data in terms of high success rate. In these cases, 90% had total success, while 7 had complete flap failures. Three of our patients showed skin paddle necrosis with bony conservation. This report focuses on the technical refinements used by the authors that can prove valuable in obtaining predictable and precise results: in particular, we discuss surgical techniques that avoid vascular pedicle ossification by removing the fibular periosteum from the vascular pedicle itself and reduce donor site morbidity and aid in management of the position in the new condylar fossa. Finally, new technologies such as intraoperative CT and custom premodelled fixation plates may also increase the predictability of morpho-functional results.
