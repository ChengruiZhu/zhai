Back ground: The aim of this study was to determine the frequency of focal reactive hyperplastic lesions of the oral cavity as reported in the Department of Oral Pathology and Microbiology, Subharti Dental College, Meerut and to compare these data with those of previously reported studies from other regions and countries.
Material and Method: Patient records of the Department of Oral Pathology were retrieved during a 10 year period from 2001 to 2010. Data of all reactive hyperplasias namely focal fibrous hyperplasia (FFH), pyogenic granuloma (PG), peripheral ossifying fibroma (POF) and peripheral giant cell granuloma (PGCG) were reviewed and analyzed for age, gender, and site of location.
Results: There were 209 focal reactive hyperplastic lesions that comprised 12.8% of the 1634 accessed biopsies. FFH was the most common lesion constituting 57.4% of the cases, followed by PG (18.7%), POF (17.7%) and PGCG (6.22%). The mean age of patients at presentation was 31.56 years. The female to male ratio was 1.5:1. The most frequently involved site was the gingiva (81.8%); other sites were the buccal mucosa, lips, tongue, alveolar mucosa and palate. 
Conclusion: Oral lesions are often detected by Dental professionals and surgeons. Knowledge of the frequency and presentation of the most common oral lesions is beneficial in developing a clinical impression of such lesions encountered in practice and to minimize potential dentoalveolar complications.
