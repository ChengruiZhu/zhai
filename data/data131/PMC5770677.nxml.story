Demands for sustainable production of hydrogen are rapidly increasing because of environmental considerations for fossil fuel consumption and development of fuel cell technologies. Thus, the development of high‐performance and economical catalysts has been extensively investigated. In this study, a nanoporous Mo carbide electrode is prepared using a top‐down electrochemical process and it is applied as an electrocatalyst for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Anodic oxidation of Mo foil followed by heat treatment in a carbon monoxide (CO) atmosphere forms a nanostructured Mo carbide with excellent interconnections, and these structural characteristics lead to high activity and durability when applied to the HER. Additionally, characteristic behavior of Mo is observed; metallic Mo nanosheets form during electrochemical anodization by exfoliation along the (110) planes. These nanosheets are viable for chemical modification, indicating their feasibility in various applications. Moreover, the role of carbon shells is investigated on the surface of the electrocatalysts, whereby it is suggested that carbon shells serve as a mechanical barrier against the oxidative degradation of catalysts that accompanies unavoidable volume expansion.
