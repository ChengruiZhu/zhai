Treatment of many cancers has been hampered by the invasive ability of tumor cells. A notable example is brain cancer, which is incurable due to its invasiveness and resulting high tumor recurrence after surgical resection. Here, we analyze further the function of NKCC1, an ion transporter that is known to regulate cell volume and intracellular chloride concentration, and to play an important role in brain tumor cell invasion. Our findings suggest that in addition to its conventional function as an ion transporter, NKCC1 may also interact with the cytoskeleton and affect brain tumor cell migration by acting as an anchor that transduces contractile forces from the plasma membrane to the extracellular matrix en route to cell migration. Moreover, we show that regulation of NKCC1 by a family of unconventional enzymes, the WNK kinases, is an important factor that affects the activity of NKCC1 and may determine the invasive ability of brain tumor cells. We postulate that NKCC1 has multiple functions in brain tumor cell migration and that together with its regulatory enzymes may be therapeutic targets in the treatment of brain tumors or other types of cancer, given the wide expression of these proteins throughout the body.
