The TomoTherapy Hi·Art System allows the application of rotational corrections as a part of the pretreatment image guidance process. This study outlines a custom method to perform an end‐to‐end evaluation of the TomoTherapy Hi·Art roll correction feature. A roll‐sensitive plan was designed and delivered to a cylindrical solid water phantom to test the accuracy of roll corrections, as well as the ability of the automatic registration feature to detect induced roll. Cylindrical target structures containing coaxial inner avoidance structures were placed adjacent to the plane bisecting the phantom and 7 cm laterally off central axis. The phantom was positioned at isocenter with the target‐plane parallel to the couch surface. Varying degrees of phantom roll were induced and dose to the targets and inner avoidance structures was measured using Kodak EDR2 films placed in the target‐plane. Normalized point doses were compared with baseline (no roll) data to determine the sensitivity of the test and the effectiveness of the roll correction feature. Gamma analysis comparing baseline, roll‐corrected, and uncorrected films was performed using film analysis software. MVCT images were acquired prior to plan delivery. Measured roll was compared with induced roll to evaluate the automatic registration feature's ability to detect rotational misalignment. Rotations beyond 0.3° result in statistically significant deviation from baseline point measurements. Gamma pass rates begin to drop below 90% at approximately 0.5° induced rotation at
