 2000/MMP-9siRNA complexes: liposomes). The uptake pathway and transfection efficiency of the polyplexes and liposomes were determined by fluorescence microscopy, flow cytometry, and reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction. The occurrence of intracellular processing was assessed by confocal laser scanning microscopy. Endosomal acidification inhibitors were used to explore the endosomal escape mechanisms of the polyplexes and lysosomes. We concluded that the polyplexes were internalized by non-caveolae- and non-clathrin-mediated pathways, with no lysosomal trafficking, thereby inducing successful transfection, while the majority of liposomes were internalized by clathrin-dependent endocytosis (CDE), caveolae-mediated endocytosis, and macropinocytosis, and only CDE induced successful transfection. Liposomes might escape more quickly than polyplexes, and the digestion effect of acidic organelles on liposomes was faint compared to the polyplexes, although both complexes escaped from endolysosomes via the proton sponge mechanism. This may be the key aspect that leads to the lower transfection efficiency of the Î²-CD-(D3)7/MMP-9siRNA complexes. The present study may offer some insights for the rational design of novel delivery systems with increased transfection efficiency but decreased toxicity.
