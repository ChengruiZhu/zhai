Chromosome biorientation and accurate segregation rely on the plasticity of kinetochore–microtubule (KT-MT) attachments. Aurora B facilitates KT-MT dynamics by phosphorylating kinetochore proteins that are critical for KT-MT interactions. Among the substrates whose microtubule and kinetochore binding is curtailed by Aurora B is the spindle and kinetochore-associated (Ska) complex, a key factor for KT-MT stability. Here, we show that Ska is not only a substrate of Aurora B, but is also required for Aurora B activity. Ska-deficient cells fail to biorient and display chromosome segregation errors underlying suppressed KT-MT turnover. These defects coincide with KNL1–Mis12–Ndc80 network hypophosphorylation, reduced mitotic centromere-associated kinesin localization, and Aurora B T-loop phosphorylation at kinetochores. We further show that Ska requires its microtubule-binding capability to promote Aurora B activity in cells and stimulates Aurora B catalytic activity in vitro. Finally, we show that protein phosphatase 1 counteracts Aurora B activity to enable Ska kinetochore accumulation once biorientation is achieved. We propose that Ska promotes Aurora B activity to limit its own microtubule and kinetochore association and to ensure that KT-MT dynamics and stability fall within an optimal balance for biorientation.
