Precise spatial and temporal gene expression is required for normal development, and aberrant regulation of gene expression is a common factor in many diseases, including cancer. Histone modifications contribute to the control of gene expression by altering chromatin structure and affecting the recruitment of transcriptional regulators. In this study, we demonstrate interplay between two oncogenic proteins, MMSET and EZH2, known to methylate histone H3 on lysine 36 (H3K36) and lysine 27 (H3K27), respectively. Overexpression of MMSET in myeloma cells increases global levels of H3K36 methylation, alters its normal distribution throughout the genome and decreases global levels of H3K27 methylation. We found that while the majority of the genome loses H3K27 methylation in the presence of MMSET, certain loci have augmented recruitment of EZH2 and enhanced H3K27 methylation, leading to transcriptional repression. Repression of these genes likely plays an important role in the disease because MMSET-overexpressing cells show higher sensitivity to small molecule inhibitors targeting EZH2-mediated methylation. Thus, our study suggests that the specific local changes may outweigh the gross global changes we frequently observe in cancer and implicates EZH2 as a novel therapeutic target in myeloma cells.
