In the environment, bacteria often evolve by the acquisition of new genes from different species. Plasmids are small DNA molecules that mediate horizontal gene transfer in bacteria, thus they are fundamental agents for the spread of antibiotic resistances. Plasmids replicate inside the bacterial cytoplasm, and propagate infectiously by contact. Plasmids control these two ways of multiplication, but like many other symbionts they suffer from a tradeoff. If plasmids become very infective, they can spread fast and successfully, but this damages the bacterial hosts they depend upon. If, on the contrary, plasmids become very mild, the host is able to grow better but the ability of plasmids to infect new hosts is hampered. We have studied the regulatory mechanisms plasmids use to overcome this paradox. We discovered that negative feedback, a regulatory motif ubiquitous in the plasmid network, allows transient activation of plasmid functions immediately after plasmids invade a new host. This might be an adaptive strategy for plasmids to be highly infective without damaging their hosts, and it illustrates a natural mechanism for DNA transplantation that could be implemented in synthetic genomic transplants.
