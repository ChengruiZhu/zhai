The role of imaging in the management of rectal malignancy has progressively evolved and undergone several paradigm shifts. Unlike a few decades ago when the role of a radiologist was restricted at defining the longitudinal extent of the tumour with barium enema, recent advances in imaging techniques permit highly accurate locoregional and distant staging of the disease as well as prognostication on those who are likely to have a postoperative recurrence. Computed tomography (CT) has always been the mainstay of imaging when evaluating for distant metastasis, with the advent of positron emission tomography/CT improving its specificity. In rectal malignancy, it is the local extent of the disease that often influences the surgical decision making and need for neoadjuvant therapy. Although endoscopic ultrasound has been the traditional technique for determining the depth of tumour invasion, over the last decade magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has emerged as a very effective tool for accurate T-staging. This review intends to address the status of various imaging modalities and their advantages and limitations in detection, pretreatment staging, and assessment of therapeutic efficacy in rectal cancer, with emphasis on MRI of high spatial resolution.
