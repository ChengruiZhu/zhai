The study included 20 patients, split into two groups of ten, with resistant infected corneal ulcers with or without hypopyon. One group was considered as the control group and treated with local and systemic specific antimicrobial drugs guided with culture and sensitivity tests. The other group started with the same specific therapy as the control group for 1 week with no obvious improvement and then was further treated with argon laser. The ten patients in the control group included five cases of fungal ulcers, three mixed (fungal and bacterial) ulcers, and two viral ulcers. The ten patients in the other group included three cases of fungal ulcers, three mixed (fungal and viral) ulcers, three viral ulcers, and one bacterial ulcer as proven with microbial culture and sensitivity tests. Eight cases of the control group and seven cases of the other group were associated with hypopyon. Before laser treatment, a drop of benoxinate hydrochloride 0.4% and a single drop of fluorescein sodium 0.25% were instilled. Argon laser irradiation of the affected cornea was performed using an argon 532 nm wavelength (Carl Zeiss LSL 532s AG; Carl Zeiss Meditec AG, Jena, Germany). A spot size of 500 Î¼m, pulse duration of 0.2 seconds, and power of 900 mW were used. All cases were followed up for 3 months after healing was achieved.
