Pathological angiogenesis is a hallmark of many diseases. We demonstrated that TR3/Nur77 is an excellent target for pro-angiogenesis and anti-angiogenesis therapies. Here, we report that TR3 transcriptionally regulates endothelial cell migration, permeability and the formation of actin stress fibers that is independent of RhoA GTPase. 1) Amino acid residues 344-GRR-346 and de-phosphorylation of amino acid residue serine 351 in the DNA binding domain, and 2) phosphorylation of amino acid residues in the 41-61 amino acid fragment of the transactivation domain, of TR3 are required for its induction of the formation of actin stress fibers, cell proliferation, migration and permeability. The 41-61 amino acid fragment contains one of the three potential protein interaction motifs in the transactivation domain of TR3, predicted by computational modeling and analysis. These studies further our understanding of the molecular mechanism, by which TR3 regulates angiogenesis, identify novel therapeutic targeted sites of TR3, and set the foundation for the development of high-throughput screening assays to identify compounds targeting TR3/Nur77 for pro-angiogenesis and anti-angiogenesis therapies.
