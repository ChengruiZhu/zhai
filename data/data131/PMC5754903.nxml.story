It has been reported that LMO1 gene was associated with progression, metastasis and apoptosis of leukemia, colorectal cancer and lung cancer. However, the association of LMO1 and gastric cancer remains unclear. The aim of this study is to analyze the relation between LMO1 expression and apoptosis of gastric cancer cells and explore the clinical implications of LMO1 in gastric cancer tissues. The results demonstrated that expression levels of LMO1 and Bcl-2 proteins in gastric cancer tissues were higher than those in adjacent tissues, whereas the opposite was detected for Bax expression (P<0.05). LMO1 protein was associated with TNM staging and lymph node metastasis in gastric cancer (P<0.05). The survival rate of the patients with positive LMO1 gastric carcinoma was lower than that with negative LOM1 expression, and LMO1 was as an independent prognostic factor in COX survival analysis (P<0.05). LMO1-siRNA transfected MKN45 cells had a significant decrease in LMO1 expression and the cell viability, despite of an increase in the apoptotic rate (P<0.05). Following LMO1-siRNA transfection, Bcl-2 expression decreased, while the expression of Bax increased (P<0.05). It's concluded that overexpressed LMO1 in gastric cancer could be as one of new markers of poor prognosis.
