Meckel's diverticulum is the most common congenital anomaly of the gastrointestinal tract. In this report, we aimed to represent a case of intestinal perforation, caused by double Meckel's diverticulum, which is a very rare entity in surgical practice. The patient was a 20-year-old Caucasian man, admitted to hospital with complaints of abdominal pain, nausea, and vomitting during the last 3 days. Physical examination indicated tenderness, rebound, and guarding in the right lower quadrant of abdomen. Abdominal X-ray revealed a few air-liquid levels in the left upper quadrant. In the operation, 2 Meckel's diverticula were observed, one at the antimesenteric side, at 70 cm distance to the ileocecal valve, approximately in 3 cm size, and the other between the mesenteric and antimesenteric sides, approximately in 5 cm size. The first one had been perforated at the tip and wrapped with omentum. A 30 cm ileal resection, including both diverticula with end-to-end anastomosis, was performed. The diagnosis of symptomatic Meckel's diverticulum is considerably hard, especially when it is complicated. Diverticulectomy or segmentary resections are therapeutic options. In patients with acute abdomen clinic, Meckel's diverticulum and its complications should be kept in mind, and the intestines should be observed for an extra diverticulum for caution although it is a very rare condition.
