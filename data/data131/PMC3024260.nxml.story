The complement system, which is the frontline immune defense, constitutes proteins that flow freely in the blood. It quickly detects invading microbes and alerts the host by sending signals into immune responsive cells to eliminate the hostile substances. Inadequate or excessive complement activities harm the host and may lead to immune-related diseases. Thus, it is crucial to understand how the host boosts the complement activity to protect itself and simultaneously establishes tight surveillance to attain homeostasis. Towards this goal, we developed a detailed computational model of the human complement system. To overcome the challenges resulting from the large model size, we applied probabilistic approximation and inference techniques to train the model on experimental data and explored the key network features of the model. Our model-based study highlights the importance of infection-mediated microenvironmental perturbations, which alter the pH and calcium levels. It also reveals that the inhibitor, C4BP induces differential inhibition on the classical and lectin complement pathways and acts mainly by facilitating the decay of the C3 convertase. These predictions were validated empirically. Thus, our results help to elucidate the regulatory mechanisms of the complement system and potentially contribute to the development of complement-based immunomodulation therapies.
