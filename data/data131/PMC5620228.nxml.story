Pancreatic cancer has a devastating prognosis due to 80-90% of diagnostic cases occurring when metastasis has already presented. Activation of the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is a prerequisite for metastasis because it allows for the dissemination of tumor cells to blood stream and secondary organs. Here, we sought to determine the role of SET oncoprotein, an endogenous inhibitor of PP2A, in EMT and pancreatic tumor progression. Among the two major isoforms of SET (isoform 1 and isoform 2), higher protein levels of SET isoform 2 were identified in aggressive pancreatic cancer cell lines. Overexpressing SET isoform 2, and to a lesser extent SET isoform 1, in epithelial cell lines promoted EMT-like features by inducing mesenchymal characteristics and promoting cellular proliferation, migration, invasion, and colony formation. Consistently, knockdown of SET isoforms in the mesenchymal cell line partially resisted these characteristics and promoted epithelial features. SET-induced EMT was likely facilitated by increased N-cadherin overexpression, decreased PP2A activity and/or increased expression of key EMT-driving transcription factors. Additionally, SET overexpression activated the Rac1/JNK/c-Jun signaling pathway that induced transcriptional activation of N-cadherin expression.
