The hippocampus is a part of the cerebral cortex intimately involved in learning and memory behavior. A common cellular model of learning is a long lasting form of long term potentiation (L-LTP) in the hippocampus, because it shares several characteristics with learning. For example, both learning and long term potentiation exhibit sensitivity to temporal patterns of synaptic inputs and share common intracellular events such as activation of specific intracellular signaling pathways. Therefore, understanding the pivotal molecules in the intracellular signaling pathways underlying temporal sensitivity of L-LTP in the hippocampus may illuminate mechanisms underlying learning. We developed a computational model to evaluate whether the signaling pathways leading to activation of the two critical enzymes: protein kinase A and calcium-calmodulin-dependent kinase II are sufficient to explain the experimentally observed temporal sensitivity. Indeed, the simulations demonstrate that these enzymes exhibit different temporal sensitivities, and make a key experimental prediction, that L-LTP is dependent on protein kinase A for intervals larger than 60 sec. Measurements of hippocampal L-LTP confirm this prediction, demonstrating the value of a systems biology approach to computational neuroscience.
