Detecting coincident arrivals of synaptic inputs is a shared fundamental property of many sensory neurons. Such 'coincidence detection' usually refers to the detection of synchronized excitatory inputs only. Experimental evidence, however, indicated that some auditory neurons are also sensitive to the relative timing of excitatory and inhibitory synaptic inputs. This type of sensitivity is suggested to be important for coding temporal information of amplitude-modulated sounds, such as speech and other naturalistic sounds. In this study, we used a minimal model of coincidence detection to identify the key elements for temporal information processing. Our series of simulations demonstrated that (1) the threshold and time window for coincidence detection were the major factors for determining the response properties to excitatory inputs, and that (2) timed interactions between excitatory and inhibitory synaptic inputs are responsible for determining the temporal tuning properties of the neuron. These results suggest that coincidence detection is an essential function of neurons that detect the 'anti-coincidence' of excitatory and inhibitory inputs to encode temporal information of sounds.
