Glutathione S-transferase (GST) genetic polymorphisms has been reported to be associated with osteosarcoma; however, the results of previous studies are conflicting. Thus, in the present study, a meta-analysis was conducted to investigate the effects of GSTM1 and GSTT1 polymorphisms on osteosarcoma risk. A literature search was performed in the PubMed, Cochrane Library and China National Knowledge Infrastructure databases to identify case-control studies published prior to March 2014. Data were extracted and pooled odds ratios (OR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated. In addition, Begg’s test was used to measure publication bias. Sensitivity analysis were performed to ensure the accuracy of the results. The meta-analysis results demonstrated no significant association between the null genotype of GSTM1 and osteosarcoma risk (OR=0.83; 95% CI, 0.37–1.85). By contrast, the results revealed a significant association for the comparison of null vs. non-null genotypes of GSTT1 (OR=1.54; 95% CI, 1.09–2.19). In conclusion, the GSTT1 null genotype may be associated with an increased risk of developing osteosarcoma. Further studies with larger sample sizes and well-designed methodologies are required to verify these conclusions.
