The aim of this study was to analyze the histological changes related to mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinases in bone and cartilage treated with abatacept for rheumatoid arthritis (RA). A total of 20 patients of bone and cartilage were assessed: 10 abatacept with methotrexate (MTX)-treated RA patients were compared with 10 MTX-treated RA patients (control). The histology of bone and cartilage was observed by staining with hematoxylin and eosin and analyzed immunohistochemically for the expression of tumor necrosis factor-α, interleukin-6, CD4 (T cell), CD68 (macrophage), receptor activator of nuclear kappa-B ligand, osteoprotegerin, osteopontin, CD29 (β-1 integrin), phospho-p38 MAPK (Tyr180/Tyr182), phospho-p44/42 MAPK (extracellular signal-regulated kinase, ERK1/ERK2), and phosphor-c-Jun N-terminal kinase. The expressions of CD29 known as mechanoreceptor and ERK known as mechanotransduction signal protein in MAP kinases in the bone and cartilage of patients treated with abatacept were significantly different from those of control. These findings suggest that increases in CD29 and ERK in MAP kinases may change the metabolism of bone and cartilage in RA patients treated with abatacept.
