Transport across physical-chemical interfaces is considered in connection with three particular problems of biological interfaces: the structure and properties of cell membranes, the properties of the lung surfactant, and the effects of ionic currents across excitable membranes. With regard to cell membranes, studies of monolayer permeation suggest that permselectivity on the basis of size is a property of bilayer structure and probably gives rise to the observed dependence of the permeability on partition coefficients. The permeabilities of lipid and protein monolayers are consistent with the bimolecular leaflet (BML) model of the membrane and not with mosaic models. Experiments with the lung surfactant indicate that, in addition to its surface tension-lowering properties, it is unusual in its ability to form a strong two-dimensional network, which probably contributes to alveolar stability. Finally, the results of studies of interfacial ionic transference suggest a new way of accounting for the ionic fluxes in excitable membranes during an action potential without assuming ion-selective pores or carriers. In the suggested mechanism, it is possible to account for the change in ionic selectivity and the proper phasing of the fluxes, as well as other aspects of excitation in natural membranes.
