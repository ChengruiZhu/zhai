The factors that control the rate of tissue growth during development are largely unknown. During embryogenesis, the formation of anucleated red blood cells (erythropoiesis) begins in the liver, with a dramatic expansion in erythropoietic tissue mass, occurring ten times faster than overall embryonic growth. We hypothesized that a network of cell–cell interactions within the erythroid microenvironment regulates this growth burst. To identify these regulatory interactions, we made use of the empirical finding that developmental processes are relatively robust to environmental perturbations. We determined how the frequency of erythroid progenitors in each of four sequential differentiation states varies during early development in vivo. We then modeled this behavior, and computationally selected those interactions that endow the network with resistance to external perturbations. This analysis predicted that erythroblasts in “state 2” of differentiation negatively regulate each other. We found that this autoregulatory interaction is mediated by the death receptor FAS and its ligand, FASL, which are co-expressed in state 2 cells. FAS-mediated cell death occurs only when the frequency of state 2 cells is high enough to permit their sufficient proximity. In this manner, FAS-mediated apoptosis dampens the initially rapid expansion of state 2 cells, and buffers unexpected fluctuations in their number, contributing to the system's robustness. We propose that a similar approach could be used to identify intercellular interactions in other rapidly growing tissues.
