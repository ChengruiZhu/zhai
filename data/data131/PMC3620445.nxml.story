The objective of this study was to analyse the genetic variability and phylogenetic analysis of six strains of rabbit haemorrhagic disease virus (RHDV), including four Czech strains (CAMPV-351, CAMPV-561, CAMPV-562, CAMPV-558) and two French strains (Fr-1, Fr-2), on the basis of a fragment of the VP60 capsid structural protein-coding gene N-terminal region. The results of our own studies were compared to 26 RHDV strains obtained from GenBank. The analysis of the genetic variability of six RHDV strains indicated that the CAMPV-561 strain is the most genetically variable. Less variable were the Fr-1 and Fr-2 strains, while the least variable was CAMPV-351. In turn, the genetic distance among the six analysed strains and 26 strains obtained from GenBank was the greatest for CAMPV-351 and Whn/China [11.3 % according to the observed divergence (OD) method and 12.2 % according to the maximum likelihood (ML) method], while it was the lowest for CAMPV-351 and FRG (0.8 % in both the OD and ML methods). In turn, the scale of the genetic distances among the six analysed strains and five RHDVa strains (99-05, NY-01, Whn/China, Triptis, Iowa2000) ranged from 9.3–10.3 % in the OD method to 10.3–13.7 % in the ML method. The image of phylogenetic dependencies generated for the strains analysed and those obtained from GenBank revealed their distribution to be in five genetic groups (G1–G5), whereas the analysed strains were included in genetic groups 2 and 3.
