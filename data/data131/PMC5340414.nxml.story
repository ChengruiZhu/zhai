Leprosy still affects approximately 200,000 new victims each year. A major challenge of leprosy control is the prevention of permanent disability due to nerve damage. Nerve damage occurs if leprosy remains undiagnosed for extended periods or when patients undergo pathological inflammatory responses termed Type-1 Reactions (T1R). T1R is a rare example where beneficial inflammatory responses are temporal separated from host pathological responses. There is strong experimental evidence that supports a role of host genetic factors in T1R susceptibility. Here, we employed a genome-wide association study (GWAS) to investigate susceptibility factors for T1R in Vietnamese families. We followed up the initial GWAS findings in independent population samples from Vietnam and Brazil and identified a set of cis-eQTL genetic variants for the ENSG00000235140 lncRNA as global risk factors for T1R. To test our proposal that T1R is a strong model for pathological inflammatory responses we evaluated if inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) genetic risk-factors were enriched among T1R risk factors. We observed that more than 10% of IBD-risk loci were nominally associated with risk for T1R suggesting a shared mechanism of excessive inflammatory response in the both disease etiologies.
