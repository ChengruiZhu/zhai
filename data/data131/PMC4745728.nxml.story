Latent membrane protein 1 (LMP1) is identified as the main transforming oncoprotein of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV). LMP1 is frequently expressed in a variety of EBV-associated cancers, including nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC), non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL), Hodgkin disease (HD), and gastric cancer (GC). However, due to conflicting results, the prognostic value of LMP1 expression on clinical outcomes in EBV-associated cancers remains unclear. We performed a meta-analysis on 32 studies with a total of 3752 patients to explore the association between LMP1 expression and overall survival (OS) in EBV-associated cancers. Overall, LMP1 expression was significantly associated with poorer OS (hazard ratio, HR = 1.51, 95% confidence interval, CI, 1.13–2.03), irrespective of cancer type. Further analyses showed that LMP1 expression correlated with poorer OS in NPC (HR = 2.48, 95% CI, 1.77–3.47) and NHL patients (HR = 1.83, 95% CI, 1.07–3.15), but not in HD patients (HR = 0.98, 95% CI, 0.60–1.62) or GC patients (HR = 0.70, 95% CI, 0.44–1.12). Subgroup analyses indicated that the age and geographical factors seemed to have an effect on the clinical outcomes of HD patients with positive LMP1 expression. In conclusion, LMP1 expression can be used as a prognostic biomarker in NPC, NHL, and certain HD patients. This data suggests that novel therapies targeting LMP1 may improve clinical outcomes for EBV-associated cancer patients.
