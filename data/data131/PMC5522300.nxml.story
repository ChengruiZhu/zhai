Considering the critical roles of miR-132/212 participated in central nervous system, many researches started to explored the contributions of miR-132/212 to epilepsy and achieve something worthwhile. Further illuminates all the genes targeted by miR-132/212 may be a valuable means for us to completely understand the working mechanism playing in epilepsy, by which it can influence diverse biological process. This study attempts to establish macrocontrol regulation system and knowledge that miR-212-3p/132-3p effected the epilepsy, for this literature search, miRbase, Vienna RNAfold webserver, Human miRNA tissue atlas, DIANA-TarBase, miRtarbase, STRING, TargetScanhuman, Cytoscape plugin ClueGO + Cluepedia+STRING, DAVID Bioinformatics Resources, Starbase, GeneCards suite and GEO database are comprehensive employed, miR-132-3p/212-3p and its target gene were found have highly expressed in brain and lots of molecular function and metabolic pathways associated with epilepsy may be intervened by it. Meanwhile, the emerging role of miR-132-3p/212-3p being involved in human cancer also been analyzed by several webtools for TCGA data integrative analysis, most remarkably and well worth exploring in our research conclusion that showed miR-132-3p/212-3p may be the core molecular underlying tumor-induced epileptogenesis.
