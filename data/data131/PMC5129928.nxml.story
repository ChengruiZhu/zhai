Serum biochemical indices reflect dynamic physiological and pathophysiological processes within the body, the associations between these markers and the number of stenotic coronary arteries have been rarely studied. 627 healthy controls and 1,049 coronary heart disease (CHD) patients were sequentially recruited in our hospital. The association patterns between serum biochemical markers and the numbers of stenotic coronary arteries were evaluated in a cross-sectional manner. Upon binary multiple logistic regression analysis, the risk factor patterns differed by gender. Age, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL) and homocysteine (HCY) were common risk factors for CHD in both males and females. Upon ordinal multiple logistic regression analysis, age, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL) and lipoprotein (Lp) (a) increased, and HDL decreased, as the number of stenotic coronary arteries increased in male patients. Age and Lp(a) were positively associated with the number of stenotic coronary arteries and total bilirubin (TBil) was negatively associated with the number of stenotic coronary arteries in female patients. Age and Lp(a) were common risk factors positively associated with the number of stenotic coronary arteries in both male and female patients. HDL and LDL were male-specific risk factors and TBil was a female-specific risk factor for an increasing number of stenotic coronary arteries. In conclusion, serum biomarker levels correlated with the number of stenotic coronary arteries and showed gender different patterns.
