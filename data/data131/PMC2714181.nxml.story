Thioredoxins are found in all types of cells and control several essential functions of life, including promotion of cell growth, inhibition of apoptosis, and modulation of inflammation. Thioredoxin has two ‘free’ cysteines in its active site, which are used to break disulfide bonds in oxidized substrate proteins. In the first step, an intermediate thioredoxin-protein complex is formed, which is broken in the second step, releasing the substrate protein in its reduced state. In other words, the disulfide is being transferred from the substrate protein to thioredoxin, or the electrons coming from thioredoxin are shuttled to the protein substrate. The exact reaction mechanism, i.e., the detailed succession of steps in which the reaction takes place, of how this mixed disulfide is broken is not known and has been debated over the last twenty years. With a multidisciplinary approach, combining computational and experimental work, we provide fresh insights into how conformational changes activate the catalytic cysteines with which this universal reduction mechanism is completed with the correct regioselectivity. This work illustrates the strengths of computational approaches in probing phenomena which are otherwise very difficult to investigate experimentally.
