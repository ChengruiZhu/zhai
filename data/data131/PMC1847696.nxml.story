 have identified over 100 genes, but âˆ¼2,700 essential for normal development were excluded from analysis. Paradoxically, these essential genes are five times more likely to be highly conserved in phylogeny than genes with no obvious developmental phenotypes. We screened these 2,700 essential genes for increased adult lifespan by initiating the gene knockdown once the animal had reached adulthood, thus bypassing earlier developmental roles. We identified 64 genes that can extend lifespan when inactivated postdevelopmentally. More than 90% of the genes we identified are conserved from yeast to humans. Many of the newly identified longevity genes extend lifespan as robustly as the most well-characterized longevity mutants. It is possible that the homologues of these genes may also regulate lifespan in other organisms as well. Genetic analysis places some of these genes in known pathways regulated by insulin-like signaling, although many of these gene inactivations function independently of this mechanism of lifespan extension. Surprisingly, a subset of these gene inactivations that induce potent developmental arrest also facilitate enhanced survival in the arrested state, suggesting that aging at any stage may be subject to regulatory control.
