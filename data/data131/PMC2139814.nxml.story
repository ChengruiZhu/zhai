 embryos, the proteins localize as predicted, but surprisingly all forms induce an ectopic axis, indicative of inducing dorsal cell fates. Given this unexpected result, we focused on the membrane-tethered form of β-catenin to resolve the apparent discrepancy between its membrane localization and the hypothesized role of nuclear β-catenin in establishing dorsal cell fate. We demonstrate that overexpression of membrane-tethered β-catenin elevates the level of free endogenous β-catenin, which subsequently accumulates in nuclei. Consistent with the hypothesis that it is this pool of non–membrane-associated β-catenin that signals in the presence of membrane-tethered β-catenin, overexpression of cadherin, which binds free β-catenin, blocks the axis-inducing activity of membrane- tethered β-catenin. The mechanism by which ectopic membrane-tethered β-catenin increases the level of endogenous β-catenin likely involves competition for the adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) protein, which in other systems has been shown to play a role in degradation of β-catenin. Consistent with this hypothesis, membrane-tethered β-catenin coimmunoprecipitates with APC and relocalizes APC to the membrane in cells. Similar results are observed with ectopic plakoglobin, casting doubt on a normal role for plakoglobin in axis specification and indicating that ectopic proteins that interact with APC can artifactually elevate the level of endogenous β-catenin, likely by interfering with its degradation. These results highlight the difficulty in interpreting the activity of an ectopic protein when it is assayed in a background containing the endogenous protein. We next investigated whether the ability of β-catenin to interact with potential protein partners in the cell may normally be regulated by phosphorylation. Compared with nonphosphorylated β-catenin, β-catenin phosphorylated by glycogen synthase kinase-3 preferentially associates with microsomal fractions expressing the cytoplasmic region of N-cadherin. These results suggest that protein–protein interactions of β-catenin can be influenced by its state of phosphorylation, in addition to prior evidence that this phosphorylation modulates the stability of β-catenin.
