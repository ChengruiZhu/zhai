A 59-year-old female with severe aortic stenosis, severe mitral stenosis with mild mitral insufficiency, persistent atrial fibrillation, severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and NYHA class of IV was evaluated by our interdisciplinary heart team. Due to the calculated Euroscore II, logistic Euroscore with 10% and 17% a decision was made towards a transapical TAVI approach. The implantation of a Sapien 3 (Edwards Lifesciences) valve in the aortic position was performed and the perioperative TEE showed a good result. The preoperative imaging revealed a narrow LVOT with risk for post interventional left ventricular outflow tract obstruction. Accordingly, it was decided against the use of balloon-expanding valves for the mitral valve position in the interdisciplinary team, as it is not repositionable. Instead, it was decided for the use of a Lotus (Boston Scientific) valve, as it is repositionable and therefore possible to retract in case of LVOT obstruction. In the present case of double valve intervention, the implantation attempt of a fully repositionable transcatheter heart valve into the native mitral annulus resulted in acute LVOT obstruction requiring immediate removal of the device. The patient was extubated and experienced uneventful postoperative recovery.
