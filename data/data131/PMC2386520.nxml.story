We reviewed the recent literature concerning investigations of esophageal peristaltic function. The gold standard for the assessment of esophageal peristaltic function is manometry with pH monitoring. Even with this investigation modality, however, we are in fact doing no more than estimating esophageal peristaltic function from the manometry and pH results. With esophageal fluoroscopy and scintigraphy, where we observe esophageal motility, there are problems with radiation exposure and handling of radioactive agents that make widespread use difficult. In recent years, the development of multichannel intraluminal impedance (MII) manometry has allowed simultaneous measurement of intraesophageal pressure and assessment of esophageal peristalsis. Using MII it is also possible to distinguish whether gas or liquid is passing down the esophagus. When manometry is performed in conjunction with transnasal esophagogastroduodenoscopy, with this unique combination it is possible to measure the intraesophageal pressure while actually observing the swallowing motion at the same time. Assessment of esophageal peristaltic function is now moving from simple measurement of intraesophageal pressure to simultaneous impedance manometry and endoscopic observation of esophageal peristalsis itself.
