Failure of spermatogenesis, which is presumed to often result from genetic defects, is a common cause of male sterility. Although numerous genes associated with defects in male spermatogenesis have been identified, numerous cases of genetic male infertility remain unelucidated. We report here that the transcription factor RFX2 is a master regulator of gene expression programs required for progression through the haploid phase of spermatogenesis. Male RFX2-deficient mice are completely sterile. Spermatogenesis progresses through meiosis, but haploid cells undergo a complete block in development just prior to spermatid elongation. Gene expression profiling and ChIP-Seq analysis revealed that RFX2 controls key pathways implicated in cilium/flagellum formation, as well as genes implicated in microtubule and vesicle associated transport. The set of genes activated by RFX2 in spermatids exhibits virtually no overlap with those controlled by other known transcriptional regulators of spermiogenesis, establishing RFX2 as an essential new player in this developmental process. RFX2-deficient mice should therefore represent a valuable new model for deciphering the regulatory networks that direct sperm formation, and thereby contribute to the identification of causes of human male infertility.
