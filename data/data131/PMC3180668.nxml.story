Rhabdomyolysis associated with fenofibrate monotherapy is extremely rare. Here, we report a rare case of rhabdomyolysis of the psoas muscle in an 82-year-old man with chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML). He was prescribed fenofibrate because of a hypertriglyceridemia. The patient reported generalized muscle pain and right abdominal pain while receiving fenofibrate monotherapy. An abdominal computed tomography scan and an abdominal ultrasound showed a large and low attenuation and high echogenicity, respectively, in the right middle abdominal area. Laboratory values included a serum creatine concentration of 4.1 mg/dl and a creatinine phosphokinase concentration of 5,882 IU/l. During laparotomy, a large hematoma and necrotic mass was identified in the right psoas muscle. Histological examination revealed that the resected specimens were of the psoas muscle with irregular fiber sizes, degenerating fibers surrounding the inflammatory reaction, and fiber necrosis that is typical for polymyositis. Based on these findings and the clinical history, a diagnosis of fenofibrate-induced rhabdomyolysis was made. To the best of our knowledge, no patient has ever been diagnosed with fulminant psoas rhabdomyolysis due to a fenofibrate monotherapy. This report details the rare case of rhabdomyolysis in a patient with CML associated with fenofibrate monotherapy and offers a review of the literature.
