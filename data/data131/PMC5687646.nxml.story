Podocyte injury underlies many forms of glomerular diseases. Our previous study showed that hyperoside, a naturally occurring flavonoid, could decrease albuminuria at the early stage of diabetic nephropathy by ameliorating renal damage and podocyte injury. However, its protective mechanism against podocyte injury is unknown. A previous study demonstrated that hyperoside might inhibit amyloid Î²-protein-induced neurotoxicity by suppressing mitochondrial dysfunction. Both mitochondrial dysfunction and its upstream determinant mitochondrial fission were closely related to podocyte injury. Thus, in the current study, we tested the effect of hyperoside on mitochondrial dysfunction and mitochondrial fission in adriamycin (ADR)-induced podocyte injury. In the mice model of ADR-induced nephropathy, hyperoside treatment inhibited ADR-induced albuminuria and podocyte injury. Meanwhile, hyperoside also blocked ADR-induced mitochondrial dysfunction and mitochondrial fission. Consistently, in cultured human podocytes, hyperoside suppressed ADR-induced podocyte injury, mitochondrial dysfunction and mitochondrial fission. All these results indicated that hyperoside might inhibit ADR-induced mitochondrial dysfunction and podocyte injury through suppressing mitochondrial fission both
