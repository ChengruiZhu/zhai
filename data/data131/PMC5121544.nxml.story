, atypical forms in which Shiga toxin is not the trigger may occur. Research over the last few years has shown that complement dysregulation secondary to mutations of genes coding for proteins involved in the regulation of the alternative pathway of complement account for most forms of atypical HUS (aHUS). Among these, thrombomodulin (THBD) gene mutations, representing 3â€“5% of all alternative pathway complement component abnormalities, correlate with early disease onset and rapid evolution to end-stage renal failure. aHUS onset is generally sudden, but occasionally the only manifestations of renal TMA are arterial hypertension, proteinuria, and a progressive increase in serum creatinine. Nephrotic syndrome at disease onset is exceptional. We describe the case of an adolescent female who presented with peripheral edema due to nephrotic-range proteinuria with bioptic evidence of TMA. Study of the alternative complement pathway showed a heterozygous missense THBD gene mutation (P501L variant) consistent with aHUS diagnosis. One year later she developed clinical signs of hemolytic anemia. Eculizumab, an anti-C5 monoclonal antibody, was started with rapid improvement. This case report highlights the phenotypic variability in aHUS due to THBD gene mutation. Early diagnosis by renal biopsy followed by genetic screening is required to optimize management in such a rare disease with a severe prognosis.
