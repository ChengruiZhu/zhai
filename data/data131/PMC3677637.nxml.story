Osmotic changes are common environmental challenges for cells, even in multi-cellular organisms, having led to sophisticated adaptation mechanisms. In order to adapt to hyperosmotic stress, yeast cells accumulate glycerol. This is achieved by short-term responses involving metabolic and transmembrane transport changes as well as long-term transcriptional responses. By integrating experimentation and simulation of a mathematical model we resolve the quantitative and temporal characteristics of different processes contributing to glycerol accumulation. We show that osmoadaptation prioritizes the redox and energy balance in glycolysis while rerouting flux from biomass to glycerol production. We further show that the glycerol accumulation network provides osmoadaptation with robustness by compensating for the loss of certain nodes and with the flexibility necessary for responding to different stress situations. Finally we provide novel insight into the roles of transport processes in glycerol accumulation and evidence that trehalose may play a role in yeast osmoadaptation. The present work provides for the first time an integrated dynamic view on a eukaryotic osmolyte system and links signaling with regulation of gene expression and metabolic control.
