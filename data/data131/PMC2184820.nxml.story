T-cell derived suppressor factors (TsF) specific for the random copolymers L-glutamic acid60-L-alanine30-Ltyrosine10 and L-glutamic acid60-L-alanine40, referred to as GAT and GA, respectively, were prepared and partially purified on the approprate antigen immunoadsorbents. GAT-TsF obtained from nonresponder DBA/1 (H-2q) and SJL (H-2s) mice were passed over immunoadsorbents prepared from normal guinea pig serum (NGPS) or guinea pig anti-idiotype antiserum (anti- CGAT) specific for a common cross-reactive idiotype found on most anti- GAT antibodies in all mouse strains tested. Both the directly suppressive activity of the GAT-TsF and the ability of GAT-TsF to induce new suppressor T cells (Ts2) in vitro were adsorbed to and fully recoverable from the guinea pig anti-CGAT-Sepharose immunoadsorbent, while the TsF passed through the control NGPS-Sepharose without appreciable binding. The SJL GAT-TsF specifically eluted from anti-CGAT- immunoadsrobents was shown to still posses I-J determinants. These data provide evidence suggesting a sharing of V region structures between B- cell antibody and T-cell suppressor factor specific for an antigen (GAT) under Ir gene control, in agreement with earlier studies on T and B-cell alloreceptors, T-cell helper factors, and T and B-cell receptors for conventional antigens.
