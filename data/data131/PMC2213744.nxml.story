 In a previous paper it has been shown that the nonpolar-polar anionic detergents can be divided into two main groups. One chemically characterized by a relatively long chain of non-polar alkyl groups, which in solution are in contact with one end of a muscle and, locally adhering to it, produce a permanent negative injury potential. This is generally accompanied by a loss of excitability. The second group, distinguished by a relatively short chain of non-polar alkyl groups acts reversibly, ordinarily preserves the excitability and, in contrast to the first group, produces locally a reverse positive potential. For reasons mentioned before, this appears likely to correspond to an increased activity. These concepts have been tested in this second paper. The measurements of the resting potentials of muscles have been supplemented by measurements on frog sciatics with the result that there are brought about, again by the detergents with long alkyl chains, regular irreversible negative resting potentials and with the short chain compounds reversible positive potentials are aroused. Furthermore, in addition there appeared the hardly expected result that muscle stimulated in the presence of short chain detergents responded with an even higher contraction. We have endeavored to explain this on the basis of general considerations concerning the physical chemistry of the excitatory process. More direct evidence of this rise of excitability under the influence of the short chain non-polar-polar detergents will be presented in the next papers on studies concerning chronaximetric measurements on nerve, referring particularly to the semidetergents, and concerning the effects of detergents in general upon the heart beat of a clam.
