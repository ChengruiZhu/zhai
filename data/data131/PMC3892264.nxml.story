Objectives: To evaluate the effectiveness of beta tricalcium phosphate (β-TCP) alone compared to β-TCP and Demineralized Bone Matrix (DBM) in regenerating localized horizontal maxillary alveolar ridge deficiencies prior to implant placement.
Study Design: The study included 20 patients with horizontal maxillary ridge deficiencies limited to one or more neighbouring teeth and initial ridge width of ≤ 5mmm. Patients were divided equally into two equal groups. Ridge augmentation was performed using Guided Bone Regeneration (GBR) principals. In group I GBR was performed using β-TCP only, while in group II both β-TCP and DBM were used. Following a 6 months healing period, bone cores from both groups were retrieved and implants were inserted. Specimens were examined histologically to calculate percentage of mineralized bone. Apical and crestal changes in ridge dimensions were calculated by digital subtraction using Cone Beam Computed Tomography (CBCT) immediately after graft placement and six months later.
Results: There was a statistically significant difference between the mean area percentage of mineralized bone between both groups where it was 40.1 % (range: 27.76-% 66.29 %) for group I and 68.96 % (range: 60.07 % - 87.33 %) for group II. Radiograpically, the mean ridge width in group I increased crestally to 4.66 mm (range:3.5-5mm) and apically to 6.12 mm (range: 4.1-6.7 mm). In group II the mean ridge width increased crestally to 5.2 mm (range 4.9-5.4mm) and apically to 6.9 mm (range 6.0-7.8 mm). Group II showed more bone gain with a mean of 1.37 mm crestally and 2.44 mm apically. This difference however was not statistically significant
Conclusion: Within the limitations of this study the combination of DBM and β-TCP can be used effectively in cases exhibiting minimal alveolar ridge defects.
