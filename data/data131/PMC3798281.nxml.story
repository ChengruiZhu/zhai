Biotechnology requires the large-scale expression, yield, and storage of recombinant proteins. Each step in protein production has the potential to cause aggregation as proteins, not evolved to exist outside the cell, endure the various steps involved in commercial manufacturing processes. Mechanistic studies into protein aggregation have revealed that certain sequence regions contribute more to the aggregation propensity of a protein than other sequence regions do. Efforts to disrupt these regions have thus far indicated that rational sequence engineering is a useful technique to reduce the aggregation of biotechnologically relevant proteins. To improve our ability to rationally engineer proteins with enhanced expression, solubility, and shelf-life we conducted extensive analyses of aggregation prone regions (APRs) within protein sequences to characterize the various roles these regions play in proteins. Findings from this work indicate that protein sequences have evolved by minimizing their aggregation propensities. However, we also found that many APRs are conserved in protein families and are essential to maintain protein stability and function. Therefore, the contributions that APRs, targeted for disruption, make towards protein stability and function should be carefully evaluated when improving protein solubility
