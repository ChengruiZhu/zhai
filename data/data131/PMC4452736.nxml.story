In total, 560 women were included in the study. The median age was 44 years. The majority were of white European origin, with fully suppressed HIV viral load, CD4 cell count >350 ÂµL and mild or no symptoms of their HIV infection. A total of 62% were sexually active, stating condom use as their sole form of contraception. Of the sexually inactive women, one-third were in steady relationships. Eighty percent reported prior pregnancies, of which the majority had one or more children. Most children were born prior to the women's HIV diagnosis and the mode of conception was predominantly natural. One-quarter of the participating women desired pregnancy, while more than half did not. The remaining quarter either stated that they already had the desired number of children or chose not to answer the question. Fourteen percent stated that their HIV diagnosis ended their wish for children; of these women, the median time of diagnosis was between 1995 and 1996. Pregnancy had been attempted unsuccessfully in one-quarter of study participants. The final question inquired what the risk of mother-to-child transmission was, with all precautions taken. Fifteen percent estimated the risk to be above two percent.
