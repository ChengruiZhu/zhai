Currently, chemotherapy with platinum-based drugs including cisplatin is the most effective therapy for the treatment of non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC). However, the efficacy of chemotherapy is limited due to commonly developed drug resistance. Spindle and kinetochore-associated complex subunit 1 (SKA1) is part of a complex essential for stabilizing the attachment of spindle microtubules to kinetochores and for maintaining the metaphase plate during mitosis. In the present study, we aimed to investigate the role of SKA1 in the process of metastasis and drug resistance of NSCLC. We completed a series of experiments to investigate the function of SKA1 in NSCLC metastasis and drug resistance including qRT-PCR, immunohistochemistry and western blotting, as well as MTT, BrdU, wounded healing, Transwell and gelatin zymography assays. We demonstrated that the expression levels of SKA1 were elevated in NSCLC and were correlated with cancer progression and malignancy. We also reported that SKA1 positively regulated the proliferation and metastatic ability of NSCLC cells. In addition, we determined that SKA1 contributed to cisplatin resistance in NSCLC cells by protecting these cells from cisplatin-induced cell apoptosis. SKA1 also appeared to regulate the ERK1/2 and the Akt-mediated signaling pathways in NSCLC cells. SKA1 is required for metastasis and cisplatin resistance of non-small cell lung cancer.
