Radiation therapy is an effective cancer therapy, but damage to normal tissues surrounding the tumor due to radiotherapy causes severe complications. The importance of the therapeutic area between tumor suppression and normal tissue injury has long been highlighted in radiation therapy. Recent advances in stem cell biology have shown that stem cell (SC) responses to genotoxic stresses of ionizing radiation can improve the therapeutic effect of radiation by repairing damaged cells. In contrast, cancer stem cells (CSCs), a small subpopulation of cells within tumors, are generally resistant to chemotherapy and radiotherapy and cause tumor recurrence. Although the underlying mechanisms are not clearly understood in detail, efforts are still underway to identify SC treatment or CSC resistant pathogenesis of DNA damage agents such as radiation therapy. In response to radiation, CSCs differ from normal SCs in their biological properties due to severe deregulation of the self-renewal ability in CSCs. Differences of cleavage mode, cell cycle characteristics, replication potential, and activation/inactivation of DNA damage treatment and cancer-specific molecular pathways between normal SCs and CSCs confer a malignant phenotype upon CSCs. However, further studies are needed to identify normal SC and CSC-specific targets. In this review, we summarize the current advances in research regarding how normal SCs and CSCs respond to ionizing radiation, with a special emphasis on cell toxicity, radiosensitivity, signaling networks, DNA damage response (DDR) and DNA repair. In addition, we discuss strategies to develop new diagnostic and therapeutic techniques for predicting responses to cancer treatment and overcoming radiation-related toxicity.
