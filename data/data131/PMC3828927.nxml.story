 For this purpose, non-Michaelis behavior of peroxidase activity of Hp (2-2)-Hb complex was analyzed using Eadie-Hofstee, Clearance and Hill plots, in the absence and presence of pharmaceutical dose of ampicillin and coamoxiclav. The results have shown that peroxidase activity of Hp (2-2)-Hb complex is modulated via homotropic effect of hydrogen peroxide as an allostric substrate. On the other hand antioxidant property of Hp (2-2)-Hb complex increased via heterotropic effect of both antibiotics on the peroxidase activity of the complex. Both drugs also have mild effect on quality of homotropic property of the peroxidase activity of Hp (2-2)-Hb complex. Therefore, it can be concluded from our study that both beta-lactam antibiotics can increase peroxidase activity of Hp (2-2)-Hb complex via heterotropic effect. Thus, the two antibiotics (especially ampicillin) may help those individuals with Hp (2-2) phenotype to improve the Hp-Hb complex efficiency of removing hydrogen peroxide from serum under oxidative stress. This can be important in the individuals with phenotype Hp 2-2 who have less antioxidant activity relative to other phenotypes and are susceptible to cardiovascular disorders, as has been reported by other researchers.
