Recent evidence suggests that hypoxia caused by acute myocardial infarction can induce cardiomyocyte apoptosis. Exosomes are signalling mediators that contribute to intercellular communication by transporting cytosolic components including miRNAs, mRNAs, and proteins. However, the systemic regulation and function of exosomal miRNAs in hypoxic cardiomyocytes are currently not well understood. Here, we used small RNA sequencing to investigate the effects of hypoxia stress on miRNAome of rat cardiomyoblast cells (H9c2) and corresponding exosomes. We identified 92 and 62 miRNAs in cells and exosomes, respectively, that were differentially expressed between hypoxia and normoxia. Hypoxia strongly modulated expression of hypoxia-associated miRNAs in H9c2 cells, and altered the miRNAome of H9c2 cells-derived exosomes. Functional enrichment analysis revealed extensive roles of differentially expressed exosomal miRNAs in the HIF-1 signalling pathway and in apoptosis-related pathways including the TNF, MAPK, and mTOR pathways. Furthermore, gain- and loss-of-function analysis demonstrated potential anti-apoptotic effects of the hypoxia-induced exosomal miRNAs, including miR-21-5p, miR-378-3p, miR-152-3p, and let-7i-5p; luciferase reporter assay confirmed that
