We studied with morphometric methods the endocytosis by pheochromocytoma cells of a conjugate of wheat germ agglutinin with ferritin (WGA-Ft) and of horseradish peroxidase (HRP). Quantitative studies indicated that WGA-Ft was cleared slowly from cell surfaces and that it was not recycled to the surface. Cells labeled with WGA-Ft for 15 min at room temperature were washed and incubated in medium containing HRP for 15 or 30 min at 37 degrees C. The greatest proportion of labeled vesicles and tubules contained only WGA-Ft (83.4% at 15 min and 85.3% at 30 min). A very small fraction of labeled vesicles and tubules contained only HRP (0.2% at 15 min and 0.9% at 30 min). Vesicles and tubules at the Golgi apparatus were labeled almost exclusively with WGA-Ft (97% at 15 min and 30 min); the rest had both labels. Most labeled lysosomes contained both labels (80.1% at 15 min and 80.8% at 30 min). Of the remainder more contained WGA-Ft alone (20% at 15 min and 10.9% at 30 min), then HRP alone (none at 15 min and 8.2% at 30 min). In contrast to the various and varying patterns of labeling with WGA-Ft and HRP of the other organelles studied, the vast majority of endosomes contained both markers (94.1% at 15 min and 100% at 30 min); the rest contained WGA-Ft only. These results demonstrate that endosomes are recipients of both fluid phase and adsorptive endocytosis markers; these findings are consistent with the hypothesis that endosomes mediate the sorting out and subsequent intracellular traffic of membrane bound and fluid phase markers. Cisterns of the Golgi apparatus did not contain WGA-Ft; in sharp contrast, when WGA-HRP was used, the cisterns of the Golgi apparatus consistently contained HRP.
