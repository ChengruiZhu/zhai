Pemphigus vulgaris is an autoimmune blistering disease characterized by a loss of epidermal cellâ€“cell adhesion caused by anti-desmoglein (Dsg) autoantibodies. The pathogenesis of PV remains unclear. However, abnormal frequency and function of Th2 cells are believed to contribute to PV. We investigated Nr4a2, a transcription factor, which has been found to regulate T cell differentiation, for its association with Th2 cell differentiation and functions in PV. We found significantly decreased mRNA and protein levels of Nr4a2 in CD4+ T cells from patients with PV, compared with healthy control subjects. In addition, mRNA and protein levels of Nr4a2 in CD4+ T cells were inversely correlated with serum levels of IL-4 and IL-13 in patients with PV. Overexpression of Nr4a2 in CD4+ T cells from patients with PV significantly reduced the mRNA levels of GATA3, IL-4, and IL-13, while Nr4a2 siRNA treatment showed the reverse effects on the expression of these Th2-related cytokines and transcription factors. The data suggest that the altered level of Nr4a2 in CD4+ T cells is associated with the development of PV. Nr4a2 may contribute to the pathogenesis of PV by negatively regulating Th2 activity and secretion of Th2-related cytokines.
