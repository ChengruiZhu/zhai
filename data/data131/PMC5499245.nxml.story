Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are multipotent cells that are currently being investigated in a wide variety of clinical trials for their anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory properties as well as their osteogenic and chondrogenic capabilities. However, there are considerable interdonor variability and heterogeneity of MSC populations, making it challenging to compare different products. Furthermore, proliferation, differentiation, and immunomodulation of MSCs decrease with aging and ex vivo expansion. The sirtuins have emerged as a class of protein deacylases involved in aging, oxidative stress, and metabolism. Sirtuin 3 (SIRT3) is the major mitochondrial deacetylase involved in reducing oxidative stress while preserving oxidative metabolism, and its levels have been shown to decrease with age. This study investigated the role of SIRT3 in MSC differentiation and aging. As MSCs were expanded ex vivo, SIRT3 levels decreased. In addition, SIRT3 depletion reduced MSC differentiation into adipocytes and osteoblasts. Furthermore, overexpression of SIRT3 in later-passage MSCs reduced aging-related senescence, reduced oxidative stress, and enhanced their ability to differentiate. These data suggest that overexpressing SIRT3 might represent a strategy to increase the quality and quantity of MSCs utilized for clinical applications.
