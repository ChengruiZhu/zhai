Previous studies have shown that symmetric tetraalkylammonium ions affect, in a voltage-dependent manner, the conductance of membranes containing many channels formed by the PA65 fragment of anthrax toxin. In this paper we analyze this phenomenon at the single-channel level for tetrabutylammonium ion (Bu4N+). We find that Bu4N+ induces a flickery block of the PA65 channel when present on either side of the membrane, and this block is relieved by large positive voltages on the blocking-ion side. At high frequencies (greater than 2 kHz) we have resolved individual blocking events and measured the dwell times in the blocked and unblocked states. These dwell times have single-exponential distributions, with time constants tau b and tau u that are voltage dependent, consistent with the two-barrier, single-well potential energy diagram that we postulated in our previous paper. The fraction of time the channel spends unblocked [tau u/(tau u + tau b)] as a function of voltage is identical to the normalized conductance-voltage relation determined from macroscopic measurements of blocking, thus demonstrating that these single channels mirror the behavior seen with many (greater than 10,000) channels in the membrane. In going from large negative to large positive voltages (-100 to +160 mV) on the cis (PA65-containing) side of the membrane, one sees the mean blocked time (tau b) increase to a maximum at +60 mV and then steadily decline for voltages greater than +60 mV, thereby clearly demonstrating that Bu4N+ is driven through the channel by positive voltages on the blocking-ion side. In other words, the channel is permeable to Bu4N+. An interesting finding that emerges from analysis of the voltage dependence of mean blocked and unblocked times is that the blocking rate, with Bu4N+ present on the cis side of the membrane, plateaus at large positive cis voltages to a voltage-independent value consistent with the rate of Bu4N+ entry into the blocking site being diffusion limited.
