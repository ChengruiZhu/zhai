When did spliceosomal introns originate, and what is their role? These questions are the central subject of the introns-early versus introns-late debate. Inference of intron evolution from the pattern of intron position conservation is vital for resolving this debate. So far, different methods of two approaches, maximum parsimony (MP) and maximum likelihood (ML), have been developed, but the results are contradictory. The differences between previous ML results are due predominantly to differing assumptions concerning the frequency of target sites for intron insertion. This paper describes a new ML method that treats this frequency as a parameter requiring optimization. Using the pattern of intron position in conserved regions of 684 clusters of gene orthologs from seven eukaryotes, the authors found that, on average, there is one target site per ~12 base pairs. The results of intron evolution inferred using this optimal frequency are more definitive than previous ML results. Since the ML method is preferred to the MP one for large datasets, the current results should be the most reliable ones to date. The results show that during the course of evolution there have been slightly more intron gains than losses, and thus they favor introns-late. These results should shed new light on our understanding of intron evolution.
