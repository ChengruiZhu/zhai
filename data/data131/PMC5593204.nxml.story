To date, only few studies have assessed oral immunotherapy (OIT) for wheat allergy and often describe severe adverse reactions during therapy. We developed partially hydrolyzed wheat-based cereals (pHC), which were used in a multicenter, open-label, OIT pilot study, in immunoglobulin E–mediated wheat allergy children (NCT01332084). The primary objective of the study was to test whether wheat allergic patients tolerate pHC and primary end point was the presence or not of immediate adverse reactions to pHC during the 1-day initial escalation phase (stepwise increased doses of pHC), with evaluation of the maximum dose tolerated. Of the 9 patients enrolled in the trial, 4 discontinued OIT because of mild to severe reactions at the initial escalation phase. The 5 patients who passed the escalation phase consumed pHC daily for 1 to 6 months. One of these patients withdrew due to noncompliance, whereas the 4 others completed the study and successfully passed the wheat challenge test at the end of the study. About 60% of the adverse events were unrelated to the study product. Our study provides preliminary evidence that pHC is tolerated by a subset of wheat allergic patients. Further studies are warranted to test its efficacy as a potential therapeutic option for wheat allergic patients.
