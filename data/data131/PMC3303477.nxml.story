This study was conducted to investigate the effects of α-lipoic acid and coenzyme Q10 on plasma levels of lipids, asymmetric dimethylarginine, oxidative stress in fructose fed rats which provide a model of dietary-induced insulin resistance and to evaluate vascular changes developing in these rats by histologically. Male Sprague Dawley rats were used in this study. The animals were divided into 4 groups. Group 1 did not receive any medication and served as a control. Group 2 received a regular diet and water ad libitum and fructose was administered as % 10 solution in drinking water. Group 3 received α-lipoic acid (100 mg/kg/day) i.p. for 5 weeks and Group 4 received coenzyme Q10 (10 mg/kg/day) i.p. for 5 weeks. For determination of plasma asymmetric dimethylarginine, glutathione and malondialdehyde levels, high-performance liquid chromatography system was used. Homeostatic model assessment as a measure of insulin resistance was calculated. Lipid profile measurements were determined using enzymatic assay on an Auto analyzer. The high fructose diet was significantly associated with an increase in levels of plasma LDL, VLDL and total cholesterol and decrease in level of HDL cholesterol. Plasma asymmetric dimethylarginine, malondialdehyde and glutathione levels were also increase in these rats. α-lipoic acid or coenzyme Q10 supplementation was found to have some positive effect on these parameters. These findings were also demonstrated by morphological observation of the aorta. We demonstrated that administration of α-lipoic acid and coenzyme Q10 notably suppresses oxidative and nitrative stress, hyperinsulinemia, insulin resistance developing in fructose fed rats, a model of metabolic syndrome (MS). These positive effects of α-lipoic acid or coenzyme Q10 can be attributed to its antioxidant activity.
