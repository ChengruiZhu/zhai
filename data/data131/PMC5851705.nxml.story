The mutualistic interaction between the gut microbiota (GM) and its host profoundly shapes many aspects of our physiology. The composition and activity of the gut microbiota is modulated by environmental factors such as dietary habits and antibiotic treatments. In rodents, studies demonstrate that the GM is a crucial regulator of bone metabolism and that modulation of the GM composition by probiotic interventions can prevent castration-induced bone loss. Short-term colonization of germ-free mice with GM results in an activation of CD4+T cells, resulting in increased levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines in bone and thereby activation of osteoclastic bone resorption. Besides these immune-mediated effects on bone mass, the GM is involved in nutritional uptake and may, thereby, regulate overall body growth and bone sizes possibly mediated via altered IGF-I levels. We recently introduced a new term “osteomicrobiology” for the rapidly emerging research field of the role of the microbiota in bone health. This research field is aimed to bridge the gaps between bone physiology, gastroenterology, immunology, and microbiology. Future studies will determine if the GM is a novel therapeutic target for osteoporosis and if the GM composition might be used as a biomarker for fracture prediction.
