Klinefelter syndrome is a disorder of variation of sex chromosome, the most common karyotype being 47XXY. Multiple case reports and articles have been published linking the increased prevalence of psychiatric disorders like Schizophrenia, Schizophreniform psychosis, Attention deficit hyperkinetic disorder, Learning disorder, etc. and seizure disorder in Klinefelter syndrome than in general population, attributing to the extra X chromosome. Here is a case of a 45-year-old gentleman with Klinefelter syndrome with schizophrenia-like psychosis and seizure disorder. He was diagnosed as Klinefelter syndrome 15 years back by genetic testing (47XXY) when he was investigated for infertility. His luteinizing hormone (LH) (32.04 mIU/ml) and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) (50.70 mIU/ml) levels were high and his testosterone level was low (1.76 ng/ml). He had four episodes of seizures in 2004 for which he was started on phenytoin and sodium valproate, and was seizure-free for past 10 years. He was brought to our hospital in July 2014 with complaints of talking and laughing to self, suspicion, hearing voices and aggressive behaviour, which were persistent mildly for past 15 years and aggravated for past 6 months. He was not going for work for past 15 years, does not mingle with relatives or friends.
