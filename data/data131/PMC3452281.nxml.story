A number of women with migraine experience increased incidence of attacks during the perimenstrual period. The Appendix of the International Classification of Headache Disorders (ICHD II) describes two types of migraine without aura related to menstruation: pure menstrual migraine (PMM) and menstrually related migraine (MRM). The phrase “menstrual migraine” is often used to cover both PMM and MRM. Although menstrual migraine is well recognized, further scientific evidence is needed before these definitions can be formally included in the ICHD III. The aim of the present study was to investigate the prevalence of PMM and MRM in the general population in Norway. The survey included 15,000 women, 30–44 years old, residing in the eastern part of Norway. They received a postal questionnaire containing six questions about migraine, headache frequency and the relation of migraine and menstruation. The study included 11,123 women. The questionnaire response rate was 77%. The prevalence of self-reported migraine was 34.8%. Of the migraineurs, 21% reported migraine related to menstruation in at least two of three menstrual cycles, of which 7.7% were considered to have PMM and 13.2% MRM. This corresponds to the prevalence of PMM and MRM in the general population of 2.7 and 4.6%, respectively. Thus, self-reported menstrual migraine among women aged 30–44 years appears to be common in the general population in Norway.
