Understanding the guiding principles behind the evolution of metabolic networks and their regulation is of fundamental importance in a broad range of disciplines reaching from the identification of novel targets to treat infections to the utilization of microbial organisms in biotechnological production processes. In our study, we used an approach that allowed us to identify optimal regulatory strategies for the control of metabolic pathways in a scenario in which the intermediates of a metabolic pathway differ in their toxicity for the host organism. The results of our approach, whose validity we demonstrate through the large-scale analysis of pathway regulation in several thousand prokaryotic metabolic networks, show that toxic intermediates are often associated to strongly regulated enzymes. Additionally, transcriptional regulation preferably targets highly efficient enzymes thereby minimizing the effort in terms of protein production that is required to adjust the flux through a metabolic pathway. Moreover, in an example case, we show how knowledge about key targets of regulation can be used to identify novel antimicrobials that inhibit cellular growth through self-poisoning of the pathogen.
