The chronic conditions growth is determined by an increase of cases of adaptive system imbalance following a recent disease. One of its most significant causes is decrease of crisis importance (a stage of disease) as a moderator of a qualitative changeover of an adaptive system. The contemporary treatment methods increase efficiency of pre-crises adaptive responses, but simultaneously they equalize the crisis to a level, which is insufficient for complete after-crisis alignment of body defenses. But the crisis is the very key to a solution to a chronic conditions problem. One of the ways of the problem solving is medical interventions, which cause sparing provocation crisis and a successive changeover of an adaptive system. Based on this it is worth reviewing critically, studying and developing the existing experience of bio-regulatory therapy, where the principle of sparing provocation is often used. The new term definitions, such as “medical intervention”, “health problems”, “crisis” are described in terms of biomedicine. The patients and physicians should be motivated to deal with chronic conditions correction and the aforesaid sets new tasks before a health care system.
