A 23 years old patient, a professional hi-rank skateboarder, took part in this pilot study. He had a torsion injury of the left knee joint. The main concepts of the rehabilitation program were: functional training in CKC that would involve muscles of the entire kinetic chain of the operated limb; the co-contraction training under the axial load, active extension training, the avoidance of static flexor stretching for at least 24 weeks after the surgery, no passive movements while exercising, the use of posterior translation of the tibia while doing the exercises, and no knee joint extensor strengthening activities in OKC for at least six months after the surgery. In order to evaluate the remodelling of the graft, seven oblique axial MR images (DOA) were taken, on which the graftâ€™s cross-sectional area was measured. The MRI's were performed in the second, sixth, and twelfth week; then in the fourth, sixth, and ninth month, and, finally a year after the surgery. The angle of the graft and PCL was also measured. Additionally, the quality of tendon signal was assessed. For the functional evaluation, isokinetic and isometric tests of the knee extensor and the flexor muscles, along with the tibial rotator functions were performed using Humac Norm device. Postural stability based on COP parameter was established, as well, using the stabilometric platform HUR. For the dynamic stabilography assessment Biodex Balance System device was used. In order to indicate the subjective functional evaluation by the patient, the Lyshom scale and IKDC questionnaires were used.
