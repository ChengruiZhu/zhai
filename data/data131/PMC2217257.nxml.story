 channels share sequence homology, suggesting a conserved secondary structure. Scanning mutagenesis with substitution of alanine and tryptophan in GluR6 channels was performed based on the structure of KcsA. Our assay used disruption of voltage-dependent polyamine block to test for changes in the packing of pore-forming regions. Alanine scanning from D567 to R603 revealed reduced rectification resulting from channel block in two regions. A periodic pattern from F575 to M589 aligned with the pore helix in KcsA, whereas a cluster of sensitive positions around Q590, a site regulated by RNA editing, mapped to the selectivity filter in KcsA. Tryptophan scanning from D567 to R603 revealed similar patterns, but with a complete disruption of spermine block for 7 out of the 37 positions and a pM dissociation constant for Q590W. Molecular modeling with KcsA coordinates showed that GluR6 pore helix mutants disrupting polyamine block pack against M1 and M2, and are not exposed in the ion channel pore. In the selectivity filter, tryptophan creates an aromatic cage consistent with the pM dissociation constant for Q590W. A scan with glutamate substitution was used to map the cytoplasmic entrance to the pore based on charge neutralization experiments, which established that E594 was uniquely required for high affinity polyamine block. In E594Q mutants, introduction of glutamate at positions S593â€“L600 restored polyamine block at positions corresponding to surface-exposed residues in KcsA. Our results reinforce proposals that the pore region of glutamate receptors contains a helix and pore loop analogous to that found in K
