 1. The use of an oxygen chamber in the treatment of pneumonia patients makes it possible to administer this gas for long periods of time under exactly known conditions. The medical and nursing care of the patient is greatly facilitated. 2. Prolonged inhalation of oxygen varying from 40 to 60 per cent appears to be without harm. 3. Oxygen administered to intensely anoxemic patients almost immediately clears up this anoxemia. Cyanosis disappears with the anoxemia. 4. The removal of patients from the high oxygen while they are still sick and while examination shows that there are still extensive edema and infiltration of the lung results in a return of the intense anoxemia. 5. It is sometimes impossible to clear up the anoxemia, even when as high as 60 per cent of oxygen is given, especially when there are considerable edema and infiltration of the lungs. 6. Five cases in which the prognosis was grave recovered. Three cases, one of tuberculosis, one with a Pneumococcus Type III infection, and a third with a pneumonia superimposed on a chronic pulmonary condition, died. 7. In all cases there appeared to be an improvement in the patient's condition. In one case, particularly, with an intense degree of anoxemia, the patient became moribund and pulseless. Following the administration of 60 per cent of oxygen there was a lowering of the heart rate from 160 to 120, the return of the pulse to the radial artery, the color became bright pink, and there was a remarkable change in the clinical condition. 8. The anoxemia of pneumonia is due, in large measure, to an impairment of the respiratory surface of the lungs. The greater the lung involvement the greater the anoxemia. Especially is this so when the pneumonic process extends throughout the lungs so that there are many patches of bronchopneumonia, with accompanying bronchitis and edema, as evidenced by the presence of r√¢les throughout the lungs. 9. Rapid and shallow breathing of the degree observed in pneumonia is, as far as present evidence shows, of less importance in the production of anoxemia.
