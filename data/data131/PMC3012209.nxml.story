ISBT 128 is the global standard for the identification, labeling and information transfer of human blood, cell, tissue and organ products across international borders and disparate health care systems. The system has been designed and perfected over almost two decades to ensure accuracy, safety and efficiency for the benefit of donors, patients and health care workers worldwide. The use of the ISBT 128 standard has grown steadily since a blood bank in Estonia first implemented it in 1997. Today, more than 3,500 facility identifiers for the use of ISBT 128 have been assigned to organizations in 67 countries on six continents. The standard has been accepted by a variety of international standard setting organizations and government regulators. It is managed by ICCBBA, a not-for-profit organization based in the USA that is governed by an international volunteer board of directors. Members of the Board of Directors represent the fields of practice affected by the standard. Advisory groups comprising international experts guide the ongoing development of the ISBT 128 standard to ensure it continues to meet the needs of its users. While there is a cost associated with the implementation and use of the standard, the clear benefits in terms of improved patient safety and ability to meet regulatory traceability requirements justify the costs.
