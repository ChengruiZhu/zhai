) are added to the erbium. The interest to use these hard tissue laser in the treatment of soft tissue lesion was because of the properties of these lasers which are well-absorbed by chromophore water apart from hydroxy appetite crystals. Erbium laser energy is absorbed by collagen, hydroxyapatite, and water components. It allows the laser to cut soft tissue, tooth structure, and bone. In the noncontact mode, the incision is scalpel-like, with very little hemostasis. In contact mode, it performs soft tissue sculpting with adequate hemostasis. The Er,Cr:YSGG is the world’s most advanced dental laser, which is ideal all-tissue laser because all dental tissues contain water, for the multidisciplinary dentist who performs a broad spectrum of procedures. It delivers the highest level of clinician control, operating efficiency, flexibility in tip, and accessory selection. For optimal clinical results and patient comfort in hard and soft tissue procedures, the erbium lasers have set a new standard of clinical performance. The present case series aims to highlight the various soft tissue applications of Er,Cr:YSGG (Waterlase Biolase®, Biolase, Inc, San Clemente, California, USA) in pediatric patients.
