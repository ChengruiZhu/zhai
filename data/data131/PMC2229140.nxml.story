Ion and voltage dependencies of sodium-calcium exchange current were studied in giant membrane patches from guinea pig ventricular cells after deregulation of the exchanger with chymotrypsin. (a) Under zero- trans conditions, the half-maximum concentration (Kh) of cytoplasmic calcium (Cai) for activation of the isolated inward exchange current decreased as the extracellular sodium (Nao) concentration was decreased. The Kh of cytoplasmic sodium (Nai) for activation of the isolated outward exchange current decreased as the extracellular calcium (Cao) concentration was decreased. (b) The current-voltage (I- V) relation of the outward exchange current with saturating concentrations of Nai and Cao had a shallow slope (twofold change in approximately 100 mV) and a slight saturation tendency at very positive potentials. The outward current gained in steepness as the Nai concentration was decreased, such that the Kh for Nai decreased with depolarization. The decrease of Kh for Nai with depolarization was well described by a Boltzmann equation (e alpha.Em/26.6) with a slope (alpha) of -0.06. (c) Voltage dependence of the outward current was lost as the Cao concentration was decreased, and the Kh for Cao increased upon depolarization with a Boltzmann slope of 0.26. (d) The I- V relation of the inward exchange current, under zero-trans conditions, was also almost linear (twofold change in approximately 100 mV) and showed some saturation tendency with hyperpolarization as the Cai concentration was decreased. The Kh for Cai decreased with depolarization (Boltzmann slope, -0.10). Voltage dependence of the inward current was decreased in the presence of a high (300 mM) Nao concentration. (e) In the presence of both Na and Ca on both membrane sides, the I-V relations with saturating Nai show sigmoidal shape and clear saturation at positive potentials. Measured reversal potentials were close to the equilibrium potential expected for a 3 Na to 1 Ca exchange. (f) Nai and Cai interacted competitively with respect to the outward current, but in a mixed competitive-noncompetitive fashion with respect to the inward current. (g) Cai inhibited the outward exchange current in a voltage-dependent manner. The half-effective concentration for inhibition (Ki) by Cai increased upon depolarization with a Boltzmann slope of 0.32 in 25 mM Nai and 0.20 in 100 mM Nai. (h) Nai also inhibited the inward exchange current voltage dependently. The Ki decreased upon depolarization (Boltzmann slope, -0.11 at 3 microM Cai and -0.10 at 1.08 mM Cai).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)
