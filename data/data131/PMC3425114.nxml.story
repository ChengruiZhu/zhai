Use of vasoconstrictors in local anaesthesia is well known. The study was done on 30 patients who underwent removal of bilateral impacted third molars. The aim of the study was to compare the efficacy of lignocaine with clonidine and lignocaine with adrenaline in respect to onset, duration of anaesthesia, and postoperative analgesia along with hemodynamic stability (systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, mean arterial pressure, heart rate in intraoral nerve block. The patients were randomly selected of both sexes (male and female) between the age group of 18–40 years. Patients received 2 mL of 2% lignocaine with adrenaline (12.5 μg/mL) on one side and 2 mL of 2% lignocaine with clonidine (15 μg/mL) on the other side at two different appointments. 2 millilitres of drug was administered in both the test group and the control group. Statistically there was significant decrease in intraoperative and postoperative systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, mean arterial pressure, and heart rate in the lignocaine with clonidine group. The efficacy of clonidine based on visual analog scale was similar to adrenaline. No significant operative complications were observed.
