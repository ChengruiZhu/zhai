Familial combined hyperlipidemia (FCH) is a familial dyslipidemia and the most common familial risk factor for premature coronary heart disease. Its genetic architecture is poorly understood. Rare high-impact variants have been identified in some patients, but have not explained a substantial portion of the trait. FCH has previously been speculated to be a polygenic disorder, but genetic data supporting this hypothesis have so far been incomplete. We provide experimental evidence for the polygenicity and heterogeneity of FCH in a large set of affected families using comprehensive genome-wide variant data. Approximately a third of the affected FCH individuals in our sample had high polygenic burden, and only a minority carried high-impact variants identifiable by genotyping. We show that the polygenic burden of affected FCH family members is comparable to that observed in individuals with similar lipid phenotypes in the general population. Genetic variants identified in large-scale population studies can also underlie the typical phenotypes observed in complex familial diseases such as FCH. Advances in genetic diagnosis based on population samples may thus also benefit FCH families. Families without high polygenic burden are good candidates for sequencing studies to identify rare variants not observable with genotyping.
