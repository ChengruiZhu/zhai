Oxidative stress and inflammation are underlying pathogenic mechanisms associated with the progression of several pathological conditions and immunological responses. Elucidating the role of signalling lipid classes, which include, among others, the isoprostanes, nitro fatty acids, prostanoids, sphingoid bases and lysophosphatidic acids, will create a snapshot of the cause and effect of inflammation and oxidative stress at the metabolic level. Here we describe a fast, sensitive, and targeted ultra-high-performance liquid chromatographyâ€“tandem mass spectrometry metabolomics method that allows the quantitative measurement and biological elucidation of 17 isoprostanes as well as their respective isomeric prostanoid mediators, three nitro fatty acids, four sphingoid mediators, and 24 lysophosphatidic acid species from serum as well as organ tissues, including liver, lung, heart, spleen, kidney and brain. Application of this method to paired mouse serum and tissue samples revealed tissue- and serum-specific stress and inflammatory readouts. Little correlation was found between localized (tissue) metabolite levels compared with the systemic (serum) circulation in a homeostatic model. The application of this method in future studies will enable us to explore the role of signalling lipids in the metabolic pathogenicity of stress and inflammation during health and disease.
