High expectations are placed upon anti-angiogenic compounds for metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC), the first malignancy for which such type of treatment has been approved. Indeed, clinical trials have confirmed that targeting the formation of new vessels can improve in many cases clinical outcomes of mCRC patients. However, current anti-angiogenic drugs are far from obtaining the desirable or expected curative results. Many are the factors probably involved in such disappointing results, but particular attention is currently focused on the validation of biomarkers able to improve the direction of treatment protocols. Because clinical studies have clearly demonstrated that serum or tissue concentration of some angiogenic factors is associated with the evolution of the disease of mCRC patients, they are currently explored as potential biomarkers of prognosis and of tumor response to therapy. However, the complex biology underlying CRC -induced angiogenesis is a hurdle in finding rapid solutions. The aim of this review was to explore molecular mechanisms that determine the formation of tumor-associated vessels during CRC progression, and to discuss the potential role of angiogenic factors as diagnostic, prognostic and predictive biomarkers in CRC.
