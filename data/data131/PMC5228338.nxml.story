Sorafenib was examined to determine whether it improves postoperative effects during early stage renal cell carcinoma (RCC). A total of 133 patients with early renal clear cell carcinoma (T1-2N0M0) with surgical indications were continuously selected. The patients were divided into 3 groups according to different treatments, including the surgery alone group (40 cases), surgery combined with cytokine group (45 cases) and surgery combined with sorafenib group (48 cases), to make a comparison of their clinical effects. The surgery combined with sorafenib group significantly reduced the recurrence rate and increased the survival rate (P<0.05). Its median survival period was >30 months and the other 2 groups were 27 months (P<0.05). In the subsequent 3 months patients were followed up and it was found that the creatinine levels were significantly elevated and hemoglobin levels were significantly decreased. The sorafenib group had significantly lower creatinine levels and higher hemoglobin levels than the other 2 groups (P<0.05). In the 3-month follow-up, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) levels were significantly reduced and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α levels were elevated, although the sorafenib group had significantly decreased VEGF levels and a higher TNF-α level than the other 2 groups (P<0.05). The adverse reaction rate was significantly lower than that of the surgery combined with cytokines group (P<0.05). In conclusion, sorafenib improves the early RCC postoperative survival rate and prolongs the survival time while reducing the recurrence rate. It does not increase adverse reactions, and improves renal function, by decreasing the level of VEGF, and improving the level of TNF-α.
