It is known that obesity is linked to type 2 diabetes, however how obesity causes insulin resistance and diabetes is not well understood. Some extremely obese people are not diabetic, while other less obese people develop severe insulin resistance and diabetes. We believe diabetes occurs when adipose tissue becomes “full,” and fat overflows into other organs such as liver, pancreas, and muscle, causing insulin resistance and diabetes. Peroxisome proliferator activated receptor gamma (PPARg) is essential for the development of adipose tissue and control of insulin sensitivity. PPARg2 is the isoform of PPARg regulated by nutrition. Here we investigate the role of PPARg2 under conditions of excess nutrients by removing the PPARg2 isoform in genetically obese mice, the POKO mouse. We report that removing PPARg2 decreases adipose tissue's capacity to expand and prevents the mouse from making as much fat as a normal obese mouse, despite eating similarly. Our studies suggest that PPARg plays an important antitoxic role when it is induced in liver, muscle, and beta cells by facilitating deposition of fat as relatively harmless lipids and thus prevents accumulation of toxic lipid species. We also show that PPARg2 may be involved in the adaptive response of beta cells to insulin resistance.
