G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) are a large superfamily of integral membrane proteins that share a characteristic 7 transmembrane helix fold. They detect various molecules outside of the cell and signal their presence to the inside of the cell. At least half of the 800 human GPCRs are potential drug targets, so understanding their structure and function is critical. Experimental structures are now available for at least one receptor from each GPCR class. The structure of the 7 helix fold is highly conserved even for receptors with very low sequence similarity. We analyze the available experimental structures and compare the common inter-helical contacts. Our analysis leads to a unified sequence-structure alignment of the GPCR superfamily that can then be used as the starting point for structure prediction of all other GPCRs. A key result of our analysis is a list of conserved contact residues and activation “hot-spots” residues that are critical for GPCR folding and function. We propose that mutations and natural variants of amino acids at these locations in the GPCRs can dramatically influence their activation state and alter intracellular signaling. This provides hypotheses for the molecular mechanisms underlying disease causing mutants for any GPCR.
