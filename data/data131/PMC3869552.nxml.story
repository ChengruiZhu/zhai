Abortion is an important problem in obstetrics throughout the world. The common and standard method for pregnancy termination at first trimester is surgery (curettage). Nowadays, an effective method of pregnancy termination at first trimester is medical treatments. The aim of this study is to compare misoprostol alone or in combination with methotrexate for pregnancy termination at first trimester. This study is a randomized clinical trial. A total of 200 pregnant women at first trimester were randomizedly divided into two groups for termination of pregnancy. The first group received 800 μg vaginal misoprostol. If conceptus residual remained, the same dose of misoprostol was repeated. The second group received 50 mg/m² intramuscular methotrexate, and then 800 μg vaginal misoprostol was administered after 72 h. If conceptus residual remained, the same dose of misoprostol was repeated after 24 h. Abdominal ultrasonography was performed at seventh day for both groups. Should conceptus residual remained or if pregnancy continued, curettage was performed. The results were analyzed statistically in terms of chi-square, and student’s t-test, using the SPSS software. A P-value equal or smaller than 0.05, was considered statistically significant. In this study, 83% of the first group and 81% of the second group had successful abortion. There was a significant correlation between the dose of misoprostol and abortion (P = 0.001) and between type of pregnancy and need for curettage (P < 0.000) in both groups, but there was no significant correlation between gestational age and the numberof doses administered (P = 0.932).In conclusion it seems that pregnancy termination by misoprostol alone or in combination with methotrexate is a safe and cost-effective method.
