Understanding the nature of genetic interactions, known as epistasis, is crucial in biology. The strength and type of epistasis is relevant for the evolution of sex, buffering of genetic variation, speciation, and the topography of fitness landscapes. While epistasis between gene deletions has been the recent focus of research, interactions between randomly selected alleles, which are of the greatest evolutionary interest, have not. We have studied the strength and type of epistasis amongst alleles that confer antibiotic resistance and have found that: in an antibiotic-free environment, the cost of multiple resistance is smaller than expectedâ€”a signature of pervasive positive epistasis amongst alleles that confer resistance to antibiotics; epistatic interactions are allele specific; a significant fraction of resistant mutations can be beneficial in certain resistant genetic backgrounds; some double resistances entail no measurable cost; and some allelic combinations are hotspots for rapid compensation. Overall, our findings provide added reasoning as to why multi-resistance is so difficult to eradicate. Importantly, our results of allelic-specific epistasis reveal an extra layer of complexity on epistatic patterns previously unrecognized.
