Treatment failure followed by relapse and metastasis in patients with non-small cell lung cancer is often the result of acquired resistance to cisplatin-based chemotherapy. A cancer stem cell (CSC)-mediated anti-apoptotic phenomenon is responsible for the development of drug resistance. The underlying molecular mechanism related to cisplatin resistance is still controversial, and a new strategy is needed to counteract cisplatin resistance. We used a nonadhesive culture system to generate drug-resistant spheres (DRSPs) derived from cisplatin-resistant H23 lung cancer cells. The expressions of drug-resistance genes, properties of CSCs, and markers of anti-apoptotic proteins were compared between control cells and DRSPs. DRSPs exhibited upregulation of cisplatin resistance-related genes. Gradual morphological alterations showing epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition phenomenon and increased invasion and migration abilities were seen during induction of DRSPs. Compared with control cells, DRSPs displayed increased CSC and anti-apoptotic properties, greater resistance to cisplatin, and overexpression of p-Hsp27 via activation of p38 MAPK signaling. Knockdown of Hsp27 or p38 decreased cisplatin resistance and increased apoptosis in DRSPs. Clinical studies confirmed that the expression of p-Hsp27 was closely associated with prognosis. Overexpression of p-Hsp27 was usually detected in advanced-stage patients with lung cancer and indicated short survival.
