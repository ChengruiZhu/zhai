Local residual disease occurs in 7-13 % after primary treatment for nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC). To prevent tumor progression and/or distant metastasis, treatment is indicated. Biopsy is the “gold standard” for diagnosing residual disease. Because late histological regression frequently is seen after primary treatment for NPC, biopsy should be performed when imaging or endoscopy is suspicious at 10 weeks. Different modalities can be used in the treatment of local residual disease. Interestingly, the treatment of residual disease has better outcomes than treatment of recurrent disease. For early-stage disease (rT1-2), treatment results and survival rates are very good and comparable to patients who had a complete response after the first treatment. Surgery (endoscopic or open), brachytherapy (interstitial or intracavitary), external or stereotactic beam radiotherapy, or photodynamic therapy all have very good and comparable response rates. Choice should depend on the extension of disease, feasibility of the treatment, and doctor’s and patient’s preferences and experience, as well as the risks of the adverse events. For the more extended tumors, choice of treatment is more difficult, because complete response rates are poorer and severe side effects are not uncommon. The results of external beam reirradiation and stereotactic radiotherapy are better than brachytherapy for T3-4 tumors. Photodynamic therapy resulted in good palliative responses in a few patients with extensive disease. Also, chemotherapeutics or the Epstein-Barr virus targeted therapies can be used when curative intent treatment is not feasible anymore. However, their advantage in isolated local failure has not been well described yet. Because residual disease often is a problem in countries with a high incidence of NPC and limited radiotherapeutic and surgical facilities, it should be understood that most of the above mentioned therapeutic modalities (radiotherapy and surgery) will not be readily available. More research with controlled, randomized trials are needed to find realistic treatment options for residual disease.
