 Meyer (Hymenoptera: Trichogrammatidae). Analyses of frequency and duration of behaviors associated with searching on artificial plants of different complexities were performed. Plant structure had no effect on time associated with locomotion behaviors such as walking, standing and flying. However, it had an impact on the area searched, which was significantly greater on simple plant structure. Also, time spent on a leaf without encountering an egg was greater on complex plant structure compared to simple one. No significant differences were found between simple and complex plant structures regarding time spent walking on the different plant parts such as twigs, limbs, leaf perimeters, and limbs of inferior and superior leaf sides. Results showed that female parasitoids spent less time actively exploring complex than simple plants. Encountering and re-encountering frequencies of eggs were significantly greater on simple than on complex plant structure. Plant structure had no effect on handling time of eggs. This study demonstrates that plant structure can modulate activities inherent to searching and ovipositing, which in turn affects area searched per foraging time unit and therefore host finding success.
