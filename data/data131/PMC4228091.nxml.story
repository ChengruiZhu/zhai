 studies indicate that myelin instability may be an early event in the pathogenesis of MSA. Lipid is a major constituent (78% w/w) of myelin and has been implicated in myelin dysfunction in MSA. However, changes, if any, in lipid level/distribution in MSA brain are unknown. Here, we undertook a comprehensive analysis of MSA myelin. We quantitatively measured three groups of lipids, sphingomyelin, sulfatide and galactosylceramide, which are all important in myelin integrity and function, in affected (under the motor cortex) and unaffected (under the visual cortex) white matter regions. For all three groups of lipids, most of the species were severely decreased (40–69%) in affected but not unaffected MSA white matter. An analysis of the distribution of lipid species showed no significant shift in fatty acid chain length/content with MSA. The decrease in lipid levels was concomitant with increased α-synuclein expression. These data indicate that the absolute levels, and not distribution, of myelin lipids are altered in MSA, and provide evidence for myelin lipid dysfunction in MSA pathology. We propose that dysregulation of myelin lipids in the course of MSA pathogenesis may trigger myelin instability.
