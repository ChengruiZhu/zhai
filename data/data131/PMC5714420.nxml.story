 unit. Due to limitations of our treatment planning system in calculating dose for this treatment, we have developed a fast Monte Carlo code to calculate dose distributions within the patient. The algorithm is written in C and uses voxel density information from CT images to calculate dose in heterogeneous media. To test the algorithm, film‐based dose measurements were made separately in a simple water phantom with a high‐density insert and a RANDO phantom and then compared to doses calculated by the Monte Carlo algorithm. In addition, a separate simulation in GEANT4 was run for the RANDO phantom and compared to both film and the in‐house simulation. All results were analyzed using RIT113 film analysis software. Simulations in the water phantom accurately predict the depth of maximum dose in the phantom at 0.5 cm. The measured PDD along the central axis of the beam closely matches the PDD generated from the Monte Carlo code, deviating on average by only 3% along the depth of the water phantom. Dose measured at planes inside the high‐density insert had a mean difference of 4.9% on cross‐profile measurement. In the RANDO phantom, gamma pass rates vary between 91% and 99% at 3 mm, 3%, and were
