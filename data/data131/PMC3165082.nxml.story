Elevated levels of reactive oxygen species are found in most oncogenically transformed cells and are proposed to promote cellular transformation through mechanisms such as inhibition of phosphatases. BCR-ABL, the oncoprotein associated with the majority of chronic myelogenous leukemias, induces accumulation of intracellular ROS causing enhanced signaling downstream of PI3K. Previously we have shown that the transcription factor NF-κB is activated by BCR-ABL expression and is required for BCR-ABL-mediated cellular transformation. Inhibition of IKKβ and NF-κB leads to cell death through an unknown mechanism. Here, we analyze the potential involvement of NF-κB in moderating BCR-ABL-induced ROS levels to protect from death in response to cell stress. The data confirm that BCR-ABL promotes ROS levels and demonstrate that NF-κB prevents excessive ROS levels. Inhibition of NF-κB leads to an increase in ROS levels and to cell death controlled through ROS-induced JNK activity. The data demonstrate that one function for NF-κB in oncogenesis is the suppression of oncoprotein-induced ROS levels and that inhibition of NF-κB in some cancers, including CML, will increase ROS levels and promote cell death.
