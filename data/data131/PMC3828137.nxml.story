Elucidation of the mechanisms that regulate cell fate has become one of the primary goals of research in cell biology and regenerative medicine. Growth factors are often used to regulate cell fate. However, stochastic cellular responses to growth regulators have prevented precise control of cell fate. We report our investigation of the relationship between heterogeneity and responsiveness in cell fate decisions by both single cells and populations of cells. Our study involved PC12, a cultured cell line for which cell-fates are affected by exposure to growth factors and culture conditions. Computational methods using a mathematical model enabled us to determine the cell-fate decisions rate in single PC12 cells and analyze the population responses to growth factors from experimental data. Our findings reveal that growth factors control cell-fate decisions rate in single PC12 cells, and suggest distinct differences in the mechanisms of actions of growth factors under different culture conditions. In addition, we observed maximum effects of growth factors when a nonextremal, moderate amount of cell-fate heterogeneity exists. Our results give several insights into stochastic cell responses, including the effects of anticancer agents on cancer cells and the optimization of methods to induce the differentiation of stem cells.
