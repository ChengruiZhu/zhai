The macronucleus of Paramecium divides amitotically, and daughter macronuclei with different DNA contents are frequently produced. If no regulatory mechanism were present, the variance of macronuclear DNA content would increase continuously. Analysis of variance within cell lines shows that macronuclear DNA content is regulated so that a constant variance is maintained from one cell generation to the next. Variation in macronuclear DNA content is removed from the cell population by the regulatory mechanism at the same rate at which it is introduced through inequality of macronuclear division. Half of the variation in macronuclear DNA content introduced into the population at a particular fission by inequality of division is compensated for during the subsequent period of DNA synthesis. Half of the remaining variation is removed during each subsequent cell cycle. The amount of variation removed in one cell cycle is proportional to the postfission variation. The cell's power to regulate DNA content is substantially greater than that required to compensate for the small differences that arise during division of wild-type cells. For example, a constant variance was still maintained when the mean difference between sister cells was increased to ten times its normal level in a mutant strain. The observations are consistent with a replication model that assumes that each cell synthesizes an approximately constant amount of DNA which is independent of the initial DNA content of the macronucleus. It is suggested that the amount of DNA synthesized may be largely determined by the mass of the cell.
