Immunological memory—the ability to “remember” previously encountered pathogens and respond faster on re-exposure—is a central feature of the immune response of vertebrates. Exposure to a pathogen results in the clonal expansion of a few relatively rare clones of immune cells which are specific for the pathogen to form a population large enough to control the pathogen. Immunological memory arises from the maintenance of an elevated numbers of these pathogen-specific immune cells. There has been much debate on the contribution of different processes such as the persistence of antigen, cross-reactive stimulation, and homeostasis to the maintenance of the elevated number of “memory” cells. Models have been useful in understanding the contributions of these various processes to the maintenance of memory. The models have shown that the decline rate of memory specific for previously encountered pathogens arises due to exposure to new pathogens—this causes the replacement of a fraction of “old” memory cells with memory cells specific for new pathogens. In this paper Ganusov, Antia, and colleagues use mathematical models to explore how the ability of cross-reactive memory cells to respond to the antigens on more than one pathogen can help in the maintenance of immunological memory.
