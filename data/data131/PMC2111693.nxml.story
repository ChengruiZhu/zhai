Conversion of the nephrogenic mesenchyme into epithelial tubules requires an inductive stimulus from the ureter bud. Here we show with immunofluorescence techniques that the undifferentiated mesenchyme before induction expresses uniformly type I and type III collagens. Induction both in vivo and in vitro leads to a loss of these proteins and to the appearance of basement membrane components including type IV collagen. This change correlates both spatially and temporally with the determination of the mesenchyme and precedes and morphological events. During morphogenesis, type IV collagen concentrates at the borders of the developing tubular structures where, by electron microscopy, a thin, often discontinuous basal lamina was seen to cover the first pretubular cell aggregates. Subsequently, the differentiating tubules were surrounded by a well-developed basal lamina. No loss of the interstitial collagens was seen in the metanephric mesenchyme when brought into contact with noninducing tissues or when cultured alone. Similar observations were made with nonnephrogenic mesenchyme (salivary, lung) when exposed to various heterotypic tissues known to induce tubules in the nephrogenic mesenchyme. The sequential shift in the composition of the extracellular matrix from an interstitial, mesenchymal type to a differentiated, epithelial type is so far the first detectable response of the nephrogenic mesenchyme to the tubule- inducing signal.
