. HC can occur almost anywhere in the body, most common organs being liver and lungs, and are usually solitary. In 25% of cases combination of liver HC with HC in other extra pulmonary locations are found. Cardiac HCs comprise of 0.5â€“2% of all HC cases. Within the heart, HCs are usually situated in the left or right ventricle and rarely found in the peri-cardium. Pericardial HC does not produce symptoms and is often painless and silent, until the cysts grow to a large size over the years, when the usual complications develop, such as cyst rupture, cardiac compression, atrial fibrillation, and even sudden death. We describe the case of a 39 year old house wife, of rural origin, with proximity to livestock, who had an asymptomatic pericardial HC along with a symptomatic hepatic HC. She clinically presented with an abdominal lump for one year with recent onset of abdominal pain for 1 month, when radiological imaging confirmed the diagnosis of an unruptured hepatic HC and a pericardial HC. The patient recovered after pericardiectomy along with excision of the HC over the left ventricle and enucleation of hepatic HC, by thoracoabdominal approach. She is doing well after 5 years of followup without recurrence.
