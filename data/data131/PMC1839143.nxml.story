A major goal in evolutionary biology is to identify the specific genetic mechanisms that have enabled organisms to adapt to their environments. Variation in deer mouse hemoglobin represents an especially promising system for examining the molecular underpinnings of adaptation because it has been possible to establish a mechanistic link between allelic variation in protein function and fitness-related variation in physiological performance. Specifically, adaptive variation in blood biochemistry and aerobic metabolism among mice from different elevations is associated with allelic variation at two closely linked gene duplicates that encode the α-chain subunits of adult hemoglobin. In this study, we report an analysis of DNA sequence variation in the two α-globin gene duplicates of deer mice in order to identify the specific mutations that underlie adaptation to high-altitude hypoxia. The study revealed that allelic differences in hemoglobin-oxygen affinity are attributable to the independent or joint effects of substitutions in five exterior amino acid residues that line the opening of the heme pocket. Additionally, patterns of DNA sequence variation indicate that functionally distinct α-globin alleles are maintained by natural selection that favors different genotypes in different elevational zones.
