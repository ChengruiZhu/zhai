 development-associated RTK signaling, has been discovered. Subsequently, four mammalian Sprouty homologues (Spry-1–4) have been identified. Here, we report the functional characterization of two of them, Spry-1 and -2, in endothelial cells. Overexpressed Spry-1 and -2 inhibit fibroblast growth factor– and vascular endothelial growth factor–induced proliferation and differentiation by repressing pathways leading to p42/44 mitogen-activating protein (MAP) kinase activation. In contrast, although epidermal growth factor–induced proliferation of endothelial cells was also inhibited by Spry-1 and -2, activation of p42/44 MAP kinase was not affected. Biochemical and immunofluorescence analysis of endogenous and overexpressed Spry-1 and -2 reveal that both Spry-1 and -2 are anchored to membranes by palmitoylation and associate with caveolin-1 in perinuclear and vesicular structures. They are phosphorylated on serine residues and, upon growth factor stimulation, a subset is recruited to the leading edge of the plasma membrane. The data indicate that mammalian Spry-1 and -2 are membrane-anchored proteins that negatively regulate angiogenesis-associated RTK signaling, possibly in a RTK-specific fashion.
