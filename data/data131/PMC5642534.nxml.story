Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) is the pathogenic factor of numerous human tumors, yet certain of its encoded proteins have not been studied. As a first step for functional identification, we presented the construction of a library of expression constructs for most of the EBV encoded proteins and an explicit subcellular localization map of 81 proteins encoded by EBV in mammalian cells. Viral open reading frames were fused with enhanced yellow fluorescent protein (EYFP) tag in eukaryotic expression plasmid then expressed in COS-7 live cells, and protein localizations were observed by fluorescence microscopy. As results, 34.57% (28 proteins) of all proteins showed pan-nuclear or subnuclear localization, 39.51% (32 proteins) exhibitted pan-cytoplasmic or subcytoplasmic localization, and 25.93% (21 proteins) were found in both the nucleus and cytoplasm. Interestingly, most envelope proteins presented pan-cytoplasmic or membranous localization, and most capsid proteins displayed enriched or complete localization in the nucleus, indicating that the subcellular localization of specific proteins are associated with their roles during viral replication. Taken together, the subcellular localization map of EBV proteins in live cells may lay the foundation for further illustrating the functions of EBV-encoded genes in human diseases especially in its relevant tumors.
