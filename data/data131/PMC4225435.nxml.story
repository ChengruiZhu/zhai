We included 62 patients with at least the 24 week follow-up for FIB-4 analysis: males 75.8%, heterosexuals 48.4%, HCV+12.9% median age 48.3 years (IQR41.1;53.5), time from HIV diagnosis 11.0 years (IQR7.3;16.7), CD4 cells 659/mm (IQR478;882), nadir CD4 203/mm (IQR115;286), FPR 46 (IQR30;70), baseline (BL) FIB-4 1.11 (IQR0.75;1.35). At BL no differences were observed in the two arms, except for platelets (−34.96 109/L, in the study arm, p=0.028) and CD4 at nadir (−70cell/µL, p0.051). After 24 weeks a significant reduction in total bilirubin (TB) (−0.55 mg/dL, p=0.025) and alkaline phosphatase(AP) (−12.96 UI/L, p=0.002) was observed in the study group. A statistically significant difference in mean change of TB (0.61 mg/dL, p=0.016) and AP (13.23 UI/L, p=0.04) at 24 week between control and study group was observed. No grade 3/4 transaminase elevation was observed for any patient even if HIV/HCV coinfected and receiving MVC. A single HCV negative patient in the control arm had grade 3 bilirubin increase. Including all patients with at least one follow-up HCV status was not associated with an increased risk of detectable VL (n=114, 4072 person-week-follow-up [IQR12;51.6]), nor with FIB-4>1.45 (n=98, 3513 person-week-follow-up [IQR11.4;50.9]).
