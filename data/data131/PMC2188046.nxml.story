A profound decrease in activities of the two lysosomal serine proteinases, elastase, and cathepsin G, was found in neutrophils of four independent beige mutants. Elastase and cathepsin G activities were assayed with the specific synthetic substrates MeO-Suc-Ala-Ala-Pro- Val-MCA and Suc-Ala-Ala-Pro-Phe-pNA, respectively. The defect is intrinsic to cells of beige mice, since transplantation of bone marrow from normal to mutant mice restored normal proteinase activity, and normal mice transplanted with beige marrow produced neutrophils with a deficiency of proteinase activity. The loss of elastase and cathepsin G activity was confirmed by separation of [3H]diisopropylfluorophosphate- labeled proteins on denaturing gels, which also revealed that other serine proteinases are at normal levels in beige neutrophil extracts. The deficiency of lysosomal proteinase activity appears specific, in that four other common neutrophil lysosomal enzymes, plus the spectrum of major neutrophil proteins are not affected by the beige mutation. The deficiency of proteinase activity is likely not the primary genetic alteration of the beige mutation, since more than one proteinase is affected, and heterozygous F1 mice have normal rather than intermediate levels of both proteinases. The lowered proteinase activity may contribute to the high susceptibility of beige mice and Chediak-Higashi patients to infection.
