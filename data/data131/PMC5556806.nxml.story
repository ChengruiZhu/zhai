Stafne bone cavity is a rare mandibular defect that was first reported by Edward C. Stafne in 1942. It commonly presents with a well-demarcated, asymptomatic, unilateral radiolucency that indicates lingual invagination of the cortical bone. A 52-year-old female patient who with nasal bone fracture, visited the hospital. During facial bone computed tomography (CT) for facial area evaluation, a well-shaped cystic lesion was accidentally detected on the right side of the mandible. Compared to the left side, no swelling or deformity was observed in the right side of the oral lesion, and no signs of deformity caused by mucosal inflammation. 3D CT scans, and mandible series x-rays were performed, which showed a well-ossified radiolucent oval lesion. Axial CT image revealed a cortical defect containing soft tissue lesion, which has similar density as the submandibular gland on the lingual surface of the mandible. The fact that Stafne cavity is completely surrounded by the bone is the evidence to support the hypothesis that embryonic salivary gland is entrapped by the bone. In most cases, Stafne bone cavity does not require surgical treatment. We believe that the mechanical pressure from the salivary gland could have caused the defect.
