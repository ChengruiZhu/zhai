Benign anastomotic strictures can occur in up to 22% of patients who undergo colonic or rectal resection. Traditionally, surgery was the preferred method of treatment, but, over time, endoscopic techniques, such as balloon dilation, have become the preferred modality. However, a high stricture recurrence rate of up to 18-20% and the increased risk of perforation due to uncontrolled stretching are its major drawbacks. Endoscopic electrocautery incision (EECI) allows for controlled mucosal incision in predetermined locations of stricture. In this meta-analysis, we have summarized case reports, case series, retrospective studies and prospective studies describing the different endoscopic EECI techniques used for benign lower gastrointestinal tract anastomotic strictures. Our analysis showed that EECI, either alone or in combination with other modalities (e.g. balloon dilation, steroid injection or argon plasma coagulation) is an effective treatment option for both treatment-na√Øve and refractory short non-inflammatory strictures. The overall success rate for EECI-based therapy for benign colorectal stricture was 98.4%, with a stricture recurrence rate of 6.0%. No major adverse event (bleeding, infection or perforation) was reported. Only minor adverse events (abdominal pain) were reported in 3.8% of the population.
