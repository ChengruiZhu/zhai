Complex I has reactive thiols on its surface that interact with the
 mitochondrial glutathione pool and are implicated in oxidative damage in many
 pathologies. However, the Cys residues and the thiol modifications involved
 are not known. Here we investigate complex I thiol modification within
 oxidatively stressed mammalian mitochondria, containing physiological levels
 of glutathione and glutaredoxin 2. In mitochondria incubated with the thiol
 oxidant diamide, complex I is only glutathionylated on the 75-kDa subunit. Of
 the 17 Cys residues on the 75-kDa subunit, 6 are not involved in iron-sulfur
 centers, making them plausible candidates for glutathionylation. Mass
 spectrometry of complex I from oxidatively stressed bovine heart mitochondria
 showed that only Cys-531 and Cys-704 were glutathionylated. The other four
 non-iron-sulfur center Cys residues remained as free thiols. Complex I
 glutathionylation also occurred in response to relatively mild oxidative
 stress caused by increased superoxide production from the respiratory chain.
 Although complex I glutathionylation within oxidatively stressed mitochondria
 correlated with loss of activity, it did not increase superoxide formation,
 and reversal of glutathionylation did not restore complex I activity.
