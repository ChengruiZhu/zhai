Surface patterning (micro-moulding) of dense, biomimetic collagen is a simple tool to produce complex tissues using layer-by-layer assembly. The aim here was to channelise three-dimensional constructs for improved perfusion. Firstly, collagen fibril accumulation was measured by comparative image analysis to understand the mechanisms of structure formation in plastically compressed collagen during µ-moulding. This showed that shape (circular or rectangular) and dimensions of the template affected collagen distribution around moulded grooves and consequently their stability. In the second part, this was used for effective fabrication of multi-layered plastically compressed collagen constructs with internal channels by roofing the grooves with a second layer. Using rectangular templates of 25/50/100 µm widths and 75 µm depth, grooves were µ-moulded into the fluid-leaving surface of collagen layers with predictable width/depth fidelities. These grooves were then roofed by addition of a second plastically compressed collagen layer on top to produce µ-channels. Resulting µ-channels retained their dimensions and were stable over time in culture with fibroblasts and could be cell seeded with a lining layer by simple transfer of epithelial cells. The results of this study provide a valuable platform for rapid fabrication of complex collagen-based tissues in particular for provision of perfusing microchannels through the bulk material for improved core nutrient supply.
