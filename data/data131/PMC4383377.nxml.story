Long periods of starvation are common in the lifecycle of microorganisms. Textbooks routinely describe that during starvation periods, cells die at a constant rate, i.e., exponential decay. The exponential decay of cell survival has been commonly assumed in the literature to analyze and predict population dynamics of microbes. Here, we show that this assumption is true only at high cell density. At low cell density, cells can persevere for extended periods of time, before dying at a constant rate. Quantitatively analyzing the kinetics, we uncover mathematical formulas governing the density-dependent, biphasic decay of cell survival. Using mathematical modeling, we further reveal key underlying processes responsible for the perseverance. Our model highlights a thrifty strategy of bacteria; upon sensing impending starvation, small amounts of nutrients are conserved and used to persevere during starvation periods. In addition to advancing our fundamental understanding of physiology of bacteria in nature, our study will facilitate the analysis and prediction of microbial dynamics in nature. We expect that our findings will have broad impacts. For example, our findings can be used to accurately predict how pathogens survive in natural environments, which will lead to better public health policies.
