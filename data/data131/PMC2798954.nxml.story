No one can produce all his needs by himself. Personal autarky poses a serious danger of collapse in cases of illness, drought, etc. Trade reduces the impact of local catastrophes, thus increasing economic stability. However, the recent series of econo-crises revealed that globalization induces coherence among markets and jeopardizes their sustainability against global failures. Economists try to identify the optimal tariff that balances between the dangers of autarky and the risk of correlated failure. The same problem appears in ecosystems with a population divided among local habitat patches. “Optimal tariff” is translated to optimal migration rate: how should one manipulate connectivity among patches in order to achieve maximum sustainability? Recolonization of habitats that undergo extinction is essential for survival, yet a too strong dispersal leads to coherence and correlated extinction. Here we use individual-based models in order to find the optimal migration rate. We show that this optimum appears when the the system takes a spatial “checkerboard” pattern that maximizes the decoherence. The insights gleaned allow for improved policies for conservation of endangered species (optimizing the effect of corridors, predicting the impact of habitat fragmentation) and, on the other hand, eradication campaigns (like vaccination or pest control).
