Baker's yeast forms smooth round colonies when grown in favorable conditions. When starved for one or more nutrients, yeast can alter its growth pattern to produce complex structures consisting of numerous interacting cells. One mode of growth, the colony morphology response, produces visually striking, lacy colony architectures. We describe both conditions that induce this morphology and also genes and pathways that are required for the response. We demonstrate that low levels of carbon combined with abundant nitrogen trigger complex colony formation. Using a candidate gene approach coupled with genome-wide mutagenesis, we identified genes involved in the production of complex colony morphology. Many of these genes are components of either a MAP kinase cascade or the Ras-cAMP-PKA pathway, two well-studied signaling pathways that are conserved across eukaryotic organisms. Yeast use these pathways to mediate cellular responses to changes in their environment. We observe shared characteristics between complex colonies and biofilms, which are organized communities of microorganisms with relevance to human health and human infrastructure, making colony morphology a candidate model for understanding how microorganisms interact to form complex structures.
