Most motor neurons receive input from the brain before transmitting to the muscle, resulting in a muscle contraction. In some cases, a small group of motor neurons can act independently to control rhythmic muscle contractions. Locomotion in mammals is thought to arise, in a large part, due to neuronal networks of this type residing in the spinal cord. However, the cellular machinery that guarantees the needed rhythmic pattern of electrical activity in these neurons is not fully understood. Here, we use a small circuit that controls stomach contractions in crustaceans like crabs and lobsters, called the pyloric circuit, to investigate potential mechanisms for regulation of neuronal activity. Ion channel proteins are integral to determination of electrical activity type. Recently, experimental studies using cells of the pyloric circuit have shown correlations in the expression of these proteins. Our study uses a mathematical model of neuronal electrical activity to detail how these correlations may be influencing activity type. We found that correlations imposed on model parameters increase the likelihood of a desired behavior, and we therefore conclude that a biological cell utilizing ion-channel correlations will have the advantage of increased robustness of activity type.
