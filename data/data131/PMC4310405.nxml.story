Plasma was obtained from 245 patients enrolled in a prospective multicenter observational study in 21 intensive care units in Finland. Time to return of spontaneous circulation, lowest systolic arterial pressure, and bicarbonate during the first 24 hours were collected. A cerebral performance category of 3 to 5 defined 12‐month poor outcome. Plasma TRP and KP metabolites, kynurenine (KYN), kynurenic acid, 3‐hydroxyanthranilic acid, and the ratio of KYN to TRP were measured by liquid chromatography and mass spectrometry. All KP metabolites at intensive care unit admission were significantly higher in cardiac arrest patients with a nonshockable rhythm compared to those with a shockable rhythm, and kynurenic acid and 3‐hydroxyanthranilic acid correlated with time to return of spontaneous circulation. Patients with higher levels of KYN, KYN to TRP, kynurenic acid, and 3‐hydroxyanthranilic acid had lower 24‐hour systolic arterial pressure and bicarbonate. All KP metabolites and the ratio of KYN to TRP, but not TRP, were significantly higher in patients who died in the intensive care unit in comparison to those who survived. Multivariable logistic regression showed that high kynurenic acid (odds ratio: 1.004; 95% confidence interval: 1.001 to 1.008;
