Frey's syndrome and infra-auricular depressed deformities are the ones of the most common complications that can occur after total parotidectomy. We report 1 case of pleomorphic adenoma occurred in the deep lobe that obtained good results from using acellular dermal matrix (ADM) after total parotidectomy. A 24-year-old man visited the hospital with oval shape mass in right mandibular angle which of 4 cm in size was found in the deep lobe of right parotid gland from Magnetic resonance imaging scanning and a pleomorphic adenoma was suspected. A total parotidectomy was performed while preserving the facial nerve. The material known as ADM were placed in the depressed part from where the mass was removed, and the site was sutured. The surgery site was healed well without any complications such as Frey's syndrome or infra-auricular depressed deformities. The pathological result was confirmed as pleomorphic adenoma. In addition to these advantages, it does not have little potential of deformation by the gravity after the surgery, and there is no restraint on circulation, which makes fabrication free and each deformation into various shapes can be described as another advantage of the reconstruction using the ADM.
