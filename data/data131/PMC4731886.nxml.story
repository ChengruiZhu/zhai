Pharyngocutaneous fistula (PCF) is the most common complication following total laryngectomy and the most difficult to manage. It often causes increased morbidity, delays starting adjuvant therapy, prolongs hospitalisation, increases treatment costs and reduces the quality of life (QoL). The objective of this study is to analyse the predisposing factors and the most important nutritional parameters related to the development of PCF in patients undergoing total laryngectomy and to suggest medical alternatives that might improve results. We performed a retrospective study of 69 patients who underwent either primary or salvage total laryngectomy in our department between January 2008 and January 2012. Risk factors for fistula formation were analysed including tumour characteristics (histology, grading, AJCC stage), treatment (primary or salvage surgery, extent of resection, flap reconstruction, preoperative radiotherapy), comorbidity and nutritional status (preoperative haemoglobin, albumin and prealbumin levels and their changes during hospitalisation). Twenty-four patients developed a PCF (overall incidence 34.8%). Fistula formation was significantly higher in patients with diabetes, preoperative malnutrition (identified from low preoperative albumin and prealbumin levels). After specific nutritional evaluation and support, no patient developed a PCF. Risk factors for PCF formation are extensively treated in the literature but identification of high-risk patients is still controversial. Our study demonstrates that nutritional status of the patient, assessed by preoperative albumin, is also an important risk factor for PCF formation in addition to classical factors. Maintenance of a normal perioperative nutritional status can be helpful to avoid this complication.
