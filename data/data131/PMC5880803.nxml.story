Guidance molecules, such as Netrin-1, and their receptors have important roles in controlling axon pathfinding, modulate biological activities of various cancer cells, and may be a useful target for cancer therapy. Dorsal repulsive axon guidance protein (Draxin) is a novel guidance molecule that binds not only common guidance molecule receptors with Netrin-1, but also directly binds the EGF domain of Netrin-1 through a 22-amino-acid peptide (22aa). By immunostaining, Draxin was positively expressed in small cell carcinoma, adenocarcinoma (ADC), and squamous cell carcinoma of the lung. In addition, western blot analysis revealed that Draxin was expressed in all histological types of lung cancer cell lines examined. Knockdown of Draxin in an ADC cell line H358 resulted in altered expression of molecules associated with proliferation and apoptosis. The Ki-67 labeling index of Draxin-knockdown ADC cells was increased compared to that of control ADC cells. In H358 cells, treatment of 22aa induced phosphorylation of histone H3, but did not change apoptosis-associated enzymes. These data suggest that Draxin might be involved in cell proliferation and apoptosis in lung adenocarcinoma cells.
