Treatments for osteoarthritis (OA) are designed to restore chondrocyte function and inhibit cell apoptosis. Previous studies have shown that activation of the glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor (GLP-1R) leads to anti-inflammatory and anti-apoptotic effects. However, the role of GLP-1R in the pathological process of OA is unclear. In present work, we aimed to demonstrate the potential effect of GLP-1R on chondrocytes and elucidate its underlying mechanisms. We found that activation of GLP-1R with liraglutide could protect chondrocytes against endoplasmic reticulum stress and apoptosis induced by interleukin (IL)-1β or triglycerides (TGs). These effects were partially attenuated by GLP-1R small interfering RNA treatment. Moreover, inhibiting PI3K/Akt signaling abolished the protective effects of GLP-1R by increase the apoptosis activity and ER stress. Activating GLP-1R suppressed the nuclear factor kappa-B pathway, decreased the release of inflammatory mediators (IL-6, tumor necrosis factor α), and reduced matrix catabolism in TG-treated chondrocytes; these effects were abolished by GLP-1R knockdown. In the end, liraglutide attenuated rat cartilage degeneration in an OA model of knee joints in vivo. Our results indicate that GLP-1R is a therapeutic target for the treatment of OA, and that liraglutide could be a therapeutic candidate for this clinical application.
