A proteinâ€“protein interaction network represents the set of pair-wise associations that have been discerned between the constituent proteins of an organism. There are three main types of such networks: (i) those determined from a single high-throughput experiment; (ii) curated, where interactions are compiled from the literature; and (iii) high-confidence, which contain subsets of interactions from total sets that may comprise any from types (i) and (ii). The latter are deemed to better represent those interactions actually occurring in a cell. Through the use of graph-theoretic analyses and a random network connectivity model, we find that biological networks of type (i), determined from a single high-throughput experiment, contain random, indiscriminate, binding patterns. However, networks of type (ii) and type (iii) are not representative of the random model, suggesting that they contain biased influences upon the protein associations. These conclusions have been suspected for some time but are further clarified in this work. Our findings provide an avenue to detect unconstrained or completely random network structures and lend insights into the identification of preferentially connected networks resulting from the underlying biological processes or manual curation.
