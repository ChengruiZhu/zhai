The relationship between voice and posture has been previously investigated. The aim of this study was to evaluate postural alterations in subjects with dysfunctional dysphonia and to analyse their variations after rehabilitation. Forty subjects with hypokinetic dysfunctional dysphonia were submitted to posturographic analysis with alternatively open and closed eyes; subjects were invited to stand upright and breath normally so that the vestibular-spinal reflex could be assessed. The following variables were considered: pressure centre coordinates on frontal and sagittal planes and standard deviations (SD), length and surface of the tract, mean velocity of the oscillations and SD, spectral frequency analysis of oscillations, statokinesigram and stabilogram. At baseline, the parameters showing the highest alterations were surface and velocity SD. All parameters improved after rehabilitation, particularly SD(X) and SD(Y), surface, velocity and relative SD; the centre of pressure shifted backwards in all patients. These results confirm that in subjects with dysfunctional dysphonia, the greater proprioceptive awareness acquired through speech therapy permits improvement in postural performance. Static stabilometry is a fundamental test for demonstrating basal postural alterations and for evaluating improvement after rehabilitation.
