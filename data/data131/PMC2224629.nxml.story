 is implicated in a proliferation of what appear as nuclear envelope replicas in the cytoplasm. The proliferation is associated with intranuclear vesicles which apparently coalesce to form comparatively simple replicas of the nuclear envelope closely applied to the inside of the nuclear envelope. The envelope itself may become disorganized at the time when fully formed annulate lamellae appear on the cytoplasmic side and parallel with it. The concept of interconvertibility of general cytoplasmic vesicles with most of the membrane systems of the cytoplasm is presented. The structure of the annuli in the annulate lamellae is shown to include small spheres or vesicles of variable size embedded in a dense matrix. Dense particles which are about 150 A in diameter are often found closely associated with annulate lamellae in the cytoplasm. Similar structures in other echinoderm eggs are basophilic. In this species, unlike other published examples, the association apparently takes place in the cytoplasm only after the lamellae have separated from the nucleus. If 150 A particles are synthesized by annulate lamellae, as their close physical relationship suggests, then in this species at least the necessary synthetic mechanisms and specificity must reside in the structure of annulate lamellae.
