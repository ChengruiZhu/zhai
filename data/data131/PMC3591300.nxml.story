Muscles are comprised of huge, multinucleated cells that feature a highly organized cytoskeletal architecture consisting of variable numbers of myofibrils, whose formation is not well understood. Each myofibril is an array of sarcomeres, the smallest contractile unit of muscles. The contractile system consists of actin filaments anchored at the Z-discs, which border the sarcomere, and myosin filaments anchored at the M-line in the middle of the sarcomere. In this study, we reveal the role of the Alp/Enigma family proteins Zasp52, Zasp66, and Zasp67 that are required for both the initial assembly and the stability of myofibrils. We also gain new insights into myofibril assembly by following it via live imaging. We can show that Zasp52 and Zasp66 cooperate in Z-disc assembly by binding directly to α-actinin, by interacting genetically, and by forming a ternary complex with α-actinin. As a result, the combined defects of removing both Zasp52 and Zasp66 or Zasp52 and another family member, Zasp67, are much more severe than would be expected from the additive defects of the single mutants. Thus, our results suggest that multiple Alp/Enigma family proteins are required to form the critical complex to initiate Z-disc and myofibril assembly.
