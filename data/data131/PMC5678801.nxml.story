The invertebrate phototransduction system captures and converts environmental light inputs into electrical signals for use in later visual processing. Consequently, one would expect it to be optimised in some way to ensure that only a minimal amount of environmental information is lost during conversion. Confirming this requires an understanding and quantification of the performance limiting noise sources. Photons, which are inherently random and discrete, introduce extrinsic noise. The phototransduction cascade, which converts photons into electrical bumps possessing non-deterministic shapes and latencies, contributes intrinsic noise. Previous work on characterising the relative impact of all these sources did not account for the discrete, causal, point process nature of the problem and thus results were often inconclusive. Here we use non-linear Poisson process filtering to show that photon noise is dominant at low light intensity and cascade noise limiting at high intensity. Further, our analysis reveals that mean bump delay is the most deleterious aspect of the intrinsic noise. Our work emphasises a new approach to assessing sensory noise and provides the first complete description and evaluation of the relative impact of noise in phototransduction that does not rely on continuity, linearity or Gaussian approximations.
