The life of a living cell relies on many distinct proteins to carry out their functions. Most of these functions are rooted in interactions between the proteins and metabolites, small-molecules essential for life. By targeting specific proteins relevant to a disease, drug molecules may provide a cure. A deep understanding of the nature of interactions between proteins and small-molecules (or ligands) through analyzing their structures may help predict protein function or improve drug design. In this contribution, we present a large-scale analysis of a non-redundant set of over 20,000 experimental protein-ligand complex structures available in the current Protein Data Bank. We seek answers to several fundamental questions: How many representative pockets are there that serve as ligand-binding sites in proteins? To what extent can we infer a similar protein-ligand interaction by matching the structures of protein pockets? How different are the ligands found in the same pocket? For a promiscuous protein pocket, how does a pocket maintain favorable interactions with very different ligands? Conversely, how different are those pockets that interact with the same ligand? We find the structural space of protein pocket is small and that both protein promiscuity and ligand promiscuity are very common in Nature.
