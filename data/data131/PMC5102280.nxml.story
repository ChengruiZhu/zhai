Cross-trial comparisons are typically inappropriate as there are often numerous differences in study designs, populations, end points, and loading doses of the study drugs. These differences are clearly reflected in the most recent updates to the European Society of Cardiology (ESC) non-ST elevation acute coronary syndrome (NSTE-ACS) and ST elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) guidelines, which include recommendations for the use of the antiplatelet agents ticagrelor, prasugrel, and clopidogrel, based in part on results from the TRial to assess Improvement in Therapeutic Outcomes by optimizing platelet inhibitioN with prasugrelâ€“Thrombolysis In Myocardial Infarction (TRITON-TIMI) 38, TaRgeted platelet Inhibition to cLarify the Optimal strateGy to medicallY manage Acute Coronary Syndromes (TRILOGY-ACS) and PLATelet inhibition and patient Outcomes (PLATO) trials. Here, we describe each of these trials in detail and explain the differences between them that make direct comparisons difficult. In conclusion, this information, along with the current guidelines and recommendations, will assist clinicians in deciding the most appropriate treatment pathway for their patients with NSTE-ACS and STEMI.
