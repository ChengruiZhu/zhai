The 52-kDa FK506-binding protein (FKBP52), a regulator of steroid hormone receptor signaling, is potentially involved in a variety of hormone-dependent cancer types. The present study investigated the expression and clinical implications of FKBP52 in breast cancer. Immunohistochemistry was performed on samples from 145 breast cancer patients and on 66 unmatched breast non-cancerous tissues (as controls) to determine the expression level of FKBP52. Publicly available microarray and RNA-seq datasets used in the present study were downloaded from the European Bioinformatics Institute ArrayExpress. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis was also performed. FKBP52 expression was moderately higher in the tumors than that in the non-cancerous tissues, but this difference was not statistically significant (P=0.176). However, available microarray datasets exhibited a significant difference in FKBP52 mRNA levels between breast tumors and controls. In the 145 breast cancer patients, elevated FKBP52 expression was significantly associated with advanced Tumor-Node-Metastasis (TNM) stage (P=0.015), lymph node metastasis (P=0.015) and tumors with poor histological differentiation (P=0.047). FKBP52 expression was negatively associated with estrogen receptor expression (P=0.033), but positively associated with human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 expression (P=0.033). However, there was no association between FKBP52 and progesterone receptor expression. Survival analyses demonstrated that FKBP52 was indicative of a poor overall survival rate (P=0.026), which was consistent with the result of Kaplan-Meier analysis, exhibiting a negative association between the mRNA of FKBP52 and overall survival (OS) (P=0.044). Other than for FKBP52 [hazard ratio (HR), 2.315; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.077–4.975; P=0.032], univariate analysis revealed that clinical stage exhibited a significant influence on the prognosis of the breast cancer patients (HR, 2.148; 95% CI, 1.011–4.566; P=0.047). However, multivariate analysis revealed that only clinical stage, not FKBP52, was an independent prognostic factor (HR, 2.721; 95% CI, 1.169–6.335; P=0.020). Patients were further classified according to their OS. Compared with the controls (3.94±2.992), FKBP52 expression in breast cancer patients with OS of ≤3 years (5.39±3.409; P=0.042) or OS of ≤5 years (5.88±3.473; P=0.005) was significantly increased, respectively. However, no significant difference in FKBP52 expression was observed between controls and individuals with an OS time of >3 years (4.84±3.769; P=0.109) or >5 years (5.32±3.372; P=0.090). Elevated FKBP52 expression may be involved in tumor progression and invasion, given its positive association with TNM stage and lymph node metastasis. Although it is not an independent predictor, FKBP52 has promise as a biological marker for estimating the progression of breast cancer.
