The aim of the present study was to prepare an oral tablet from liquid yogurt by reforming the physical properties for easy transportation, long-term storage and also as a complementary dairy product in case of nutrient deficiency. The liquid fresh yogurt was lyophilized at -40°C and 0.03 mTor pressure. The dry powder was homogenized by a 12 mesh size sieve. Some tests such as Carr’s compressibility index, Hausner ratio and the angle of repose were applied to evaluate the flowability of yogurt powder. Study of the deformation of particles during forcing was done by calculation of the elastic recovery index. Carr’s compressibility index percent and Hausner ratio were calculated 15 and 0.94, respectively. The range of repose angle was measured between19-20°. The elastic recovery was obtained up to 60%. Since the hardness of tablets increased by decreasing compression velocity, therefore yogurt powder might have a plastic deformation. The reduction of powder volume due to compression force was about 20% (p < 0.05). Tablets with low fat yogurt showed very good compressibility with 6-12 Strong-Cab (SC) hardness units. Producing a complementary formulated as a tablet from yogurt powder is possible and also maybe therapeutically effective against lactose-intolerance syndrome and preventing antibiotic-associated diarrhea.We suggest that for more authentic confirmation of the type of deformation, it should go through Heckel’s equation analysis, too.
