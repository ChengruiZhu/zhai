Nasopharyngeal adenoid cystic carcinoma (NACC) is a rare malignancy with high local invasiveness. To date, there is no consensus on the imaging characteristics of NACC. To address this, we retrospectively reviewed 10 cases of NACC and summarized the magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) features. MR images of 10 patients with histologically validated NACC were reviewed by two experienced radiologists. The location, shape, margin, signal intensity, lesion texture, contrast enhancement patterns, local invasion, and cervical lymphadenopathy of all tumors were evaluated. Clinical and pathologic records were also reviewed. No patients were positive for antibodies against Epstein-Barr virus (EBV). The imaging patterns of primary tumors were classified into two types as determined by location, shape, and margin. Of all patients, 7 had tumors with a type 1 imaging pattern and 3 had tumors with a type 2 imaging pattern. The 4 tubular NACCs were all homogeneous tumors, whereas 3 (60%) of 5 cribriform NACCs and the sole solid NACC were heterogeneous tumors with separations or central necrosis on MR images. Five patients had perineural infiltration and intracranial involvement, and only 2 had cervical lymphadenopathy. Based on these results, we conclude that NACC is a local, aggressive neoplasm that is often negative for EBV infection and associated with a low incidence of cervical lymphadenopathy. Furthermore, MRI features of NACC vary in locations and histological subtypes.
