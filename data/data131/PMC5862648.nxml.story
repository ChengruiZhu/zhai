This previously healthy 4-year-old boy presented with parieto-temporal brain tumor, diagnosed as CPC grade-3. Screening for cancer-predisposing syndrome revealed heterozygous p53 germline mutation, leading to LFS diagnosis. After tumour resection and systemic chemotherapy, entire craniospinal axis was irradiated due to leptomeningeal seeding, resulting in disease stabilization for nearly 12â€¯months. Blood lymphocytes of LFS patient (p53-deficient) and age-matched tumor-children (p53-proficient) were collected before, during and after craniospinal irradiation and compared with asymptomatic carriers for identical p53 mutation, not exposed to DNA-damaging treatment. In p53-deficient lymphocytes of LFS patient radiation-induced DNA damage failed to induce cell-cycle arrest or apoptosis. Although DNA repair capacity was not impaired, p53-deficient blood lymphocytes of LFS patient showed significant accumulation of 53BP1-foci during and even several months after irradiation, reflecting persistent DNA damage. Electron microscopy revealed DNA abnormalities ranging from simple unrepaired lesions to chromosomal abnormalities. Metaphase spreads of p53-deficient lymphocytes explored by mFISH revealed high amounts of complex chromosomal aberrations after craniospinal irradiation.
