Mammalian cells enter the division cycle in response to appropriate growth signals. For each cell, the decision to do so is critically dependent on the interplay between environmental cues and the internal state of the cell and is influenced by random fluctuations in cellular processes. Indeed, experimental evidence indicates that cell cycle entry is highly variable from cell to cell, even within a clonal population. To account for such variability, a number of phenomenological models have been previously proposed. These models primarily fall into two types depending on their fundamental assumptions on the origin of the variability. “Transition probability” models presume that variability in cell cycle entry originates from the fact that entry in each individual cell is random but also governed by a fixed probability. In contrast, “growth-controlled” models assume that the growth rates across a population are variable and result in cells that are out of phase developmentally. While both kinds of models provide a good fit to experimental data, their lack of mechanistic details limits their predictive power and has led to unresolved debate between their practitioners. In this study, we developed a mechanistically based stochastic model of the temporal dynamics of activation of the E2F transcription factor, which is used here as a marker of the transition of cells from quiescence to active cell cycling. Using this model, we show that “transition probability” and “growth-controlled” models can be reconciled by incorporation of a small number of basic cellular parameters related to protein synthesis and turnover, protein modification, stochasticity, and the like. Essentially our work shows that each kind of phenomenological model holds true for describing a particular aspect of the cell cycle transition. We suggest that incorporation of basic cellular parameters in this manner into phenomenological models may constitute a broadly applicable approach to defining concise, quantitative phenotypes of cell physiology.
