We have discovered that fibrillin-1, which forms extracellular microfibrils, can regulate the bioavailability of transforming growth factor (TGF) β1, a powerful cytokine that modulates cell survival and phenotype. Altered TGFβ signaling is a major contributor to the pathology of Marfan syndrome (MFS) and related diseases. In the presence of cell layer extracellular matrix, a fibrillin-1 sequence encoded by exons 44–49 releases endogenous TGFβ1, thereby stimulating TGFβ receptor–mediated Smad2 signaling. This altered TGFβ1 bioavailability does not require intact cells, proteolysis, or the altered expression of TGFβ1 or its receptors. Mass spectrometry revealed that a fibrillin-1 fragment containing the TGFβ1-releasing sequence specifically associates with full-length fibrillin-1 in cell layers. Solid-phase and BIAcore binding studies showed that this fragment interacts strongly and specifically with N-terminal fibrillin-1, thereby inhibiting the association of C-terminal latent TGFβ-binding protein 1 (a component of the large latent complex [LLC]) with N-terminal fibrillin-1. By releasing LLC from microfibrils, the fibrillin-1 sequence encoded by exons 44–49 can contribute to MFS and related diseases.
