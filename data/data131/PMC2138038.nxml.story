) whether there are signals within the occludin structure that are required for targeting to the sites of junctional interaction. mRNAs transcribed from a series of COOH-terminally truncated occludin mutants were microinjected into the anteroâ€“dorsal blastomere of eight-cell embryos. 8 h after injection, the full-length and the five COOH-terminally truncated proteins were all detected at tight junctions as defined by colocalization with both endogenous occludin and zonula occludens-1 demonstrating that exogenous occludin correctly targeted to the tight junction. Importantly, our data show that tight junctions containing four of the COOH-terminally truncated occludin proteins were leaky; the intercellular spaces between the apical cells were penetrated by sulfosuccinimidyl-6-(biotinamido) Hexanoate (NHS-LC-biotin). In contrast, embryos injected with mRNAs coding for the full-length, the least truncated, or the soluble COOH terminus remained impermeable to the NHS-LC-biotin tracer. The leakage induced by the mutant occludins could be rescued by coinjection with full-length occludin mRNA. Immunoprecipitation analysis of detergent-solubilized embryo membranes revealed that the exogenous occludin was bound to endogenous
