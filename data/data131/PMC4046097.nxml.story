, enlarged and developed embryos or calli. The application of 2,4-D on pollinated flowers stimulated callus development but did not increase the frequency of embryo development from ovules and, thus, was not useful for increasing the frequency of haploid plant recovery. The efficiency of embryo development was accession-dependent and varied from 0 to 24.29%. In optimized conditions, most accessions responded by embryo development exclusively. The highest frequency of embryo development was observed from ovules excised from ovaries 20–22 d after pollination with parsley pollen. Among several media used for ovule culture, 1/2-strength Murashige and Skoog medium with 0.06 μM indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) was the best. It allowed the production of embryos at a similar frequency as on the media supplemented with kinetin, gibberellic acid, putrescine, or thidiazuron, but restricted callus development. Most plants obtained were haploids and diploids derived from parthenogenesis, as evidenced by homozygosity at three independent loci based on isozyme and PCR analyses. In total, considering haploids and embryo-derived homozygous diploids together, 72.6% of regenerated plants were of gametic origin.
