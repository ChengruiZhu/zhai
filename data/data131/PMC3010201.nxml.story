Electromechanical reshaping (EMR) has been recently described as an alternative method for reshaping facial cartilage without the need for incisions or sutures. This study focuses on determining the short- and long-term viability of chondrocytes following EMR in cartilage grafts maintained in tissue culture. Flat rabbit nasal septal cartilage specimens were bent into semi-cylindrical shapes by an aluminum jig while a constant electric voltage was applied across the concave and convex surfaces. After EMR, specimens were maintained in culture media for 64 days. Over this time period, specimens were serially biopsied and then stained with a fluorescent live–dead assay system and imaged using laser scanning confocal microscopy. In addition, the fraction of viable chondrocytes was measured, correlated with voltage, voltage application time, electric field configuration, and examined serially. The fraction of viable chondrocytes decreased with voltage and application time. High local electric field intensity and proximity to the positive electrode also focally reduced chondrocyte viability. The density of viable chondrocytes decreased over time and reached a steady state after 2–4 weeks. Viable cells were concentrated within the central region of the specimen. Approximately 20% of original chondrocytes remained viable after reshaping with optimal voltage and application time parameters and compared favorably with conventional surgical shape change techniques such as morselization.
