Diabetes is often characterized by a failure of insulin production by pancreatic β-cells to properly regulate glucose homeostasis. Insulin resistance can lead to β-cell failure, and our studies have focused on elucidating the mechanisms involved in this postnatal failure. In this study, we evaluated a new, negatively regulated enzyme of the insulin signaling pathway, glycogen synthase kinase 3 (Gsk-3), specifically within insulin-producing pancreatic β-cells. When this enzyme is elevated, it can impair replication and increase cell death, resulting in loss of insulin-producing cells and diabetes. Gsk-3 is also known to regulate cell death and proliferation in neurons. We assessed the role of Gsk-3 on glucose homeostasis in two different mouse models of insulin resistance. We demonstrated that genetically reducing the levels of Gsk-3β in the insulin-resistant mouse improved glucose homeostasis. In another model in which severe insulin resistance is associated with destruction of β-cells, reducing Gsk-3β not only preserved β-cells by increasing proliferation and reducing cell death, but it also corrected diabetes. Controlling activity of Gsk-3 could lead to new hopes for maintaining or improving β-cell number and prevention of diabetes.
