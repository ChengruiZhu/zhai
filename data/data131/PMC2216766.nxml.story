The actions of the optical enantiomers of BAY K 8644 and Sandoz 202,791 were studied on barium inward currents recorded using the whole-cell configuration of the patch clamp technique from enzymatically isolated smooth muscle cells from the rabbit ear artery. The enantiomers were applied by bath perfusion or rapidly by a concentration jump technique, which enabled the study of drug action under equilibrium and nonequilibrium conditions. A larger effect of agonists was seen on peak inward current in 110 mM Ba when small rather than large depolarizations were applied. The midpoint voltage of the steady-state inactivation curve of IBa was -12.8 +/- 1.9 mV (n = 4) in the absence of drug, -16.4 +/- 2.5 mV (n = 4) in 1 microM (+)202,791, and -31.4 +/- 0.4 mV (n = 4) in 1 microM (-)202,791. The rate of onset of action of the agonist and antagonist enantiomers of BAY K 8644 and Sandoz 202,791 was studied by rapid application during 20-ms depolarizing steps from different holding potentials to +30 mV at 1 or 0.2 Hz. The drugs were applied as concentration jumps between two single pulses of a pulse train. The rates of onset of drug action on peak IBa during a 1-Hz pulse train were concentration dependent over the range of 100 nM-3 microM for both (+) and (-)202,791. The rate of onset of inhibition of peak current by antagonist enantiomers was not significantly influenced by the test pulse frequency. At a holding potential of -60 mV, the onset rate of the increase in peak IBa on application of 1 microM of agonist enantiomers (+)202,791 or (-)BAY K 8644 during a train of pulses occurred with mean time constants of 2.1 +/- 0.7 s (n = 7) and 2.3 +/- 0.2 s (n = 4), respectively. The onset of current increase on application of 1 microM (+)202,791 during a single voltage clamp step to 20 mV was faster, with a mean time constant of 380 +/- 80 ms (n = 3).
