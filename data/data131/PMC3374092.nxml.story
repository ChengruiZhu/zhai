The integration host factor (IHF) is a protein which sequence specifically induces a bend of double-stranded DNA by more than 160°. Based on IHF as lead structure, a peptide mimic was introduced resembling the positively charged body of the protein by a lysine dendrimer and the minor groove recognition loop by a cyclopeptide. The proline located close to the tip of the recognition loop intercalates between the base pair plane. It was modified in order to evaluate the influence of the side chain residue with respect to size (1,2,3,4-tetrahydroisoquinoline-3-carboxylic acid), aromaticity (phenylalanine), conformation of the five-membered ring [(4R)-fluoroproline, (4S)-fluoroproline, 3,4-dehydroproline], and the peptide backbone conformation (α-methylproline) on binding dsDNA and bending the double strand. Binding and bending studies were carried out by fluorescence resonance energy transfer experiments and gel electrophoresis using DNA sequences prepared by PCR with the IHF binding site in central or terminal position. Whereas aromatic residues and α-methylproline were not tolerated as proline substitute, incorporation of (4S)-fluoroproline and 3,4-dehydroproline provided enhanced binding.
