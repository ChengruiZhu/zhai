Using these methods, after screening 437 patients in Malawi and 314 in South Africa, the researchers recruited 273 patients to the Malawi cohort and 311 adults to the South African cohort (the training and test cohorts). Following technical failures, 536 microarray samples were available for analysis. The researchers identified a set of 27 transcripts that could distinguish between TB and latent TB and a set of 44 transcripts that could distinguish TB from other diseases. These multi-transcript signatures were then used to calculate a single value disease risk score for every patient. In the test cohorts, the disease risk score had a high sensitivity (95%) and specificity (90%) for distinguishing TB from latent TB infection (sensitivity is a measure of true positives, correctly identified as such and specificity is a measure of true negatives, correctly identified as such) and for distinguishing TB from other diseases (sensitivity 93% and specificity 88%). In the independent validation cohort, the researchers found that patients with TB could be distinguished from patients with latent TB infection (sensitivity 95% and specificity 94%) and also from patients with other diseases (sensitivity 100% and specificity 96%).
