A total of 26 male cadaveric eyes were used, of which four (16.7%) were probably non-Caucasian. Two (8%) of the eyes needed septoplasty, one (4%) needed uncinectomy, and none needed turbinoplasty. Four (16%) lacrimal sacs were anterior to axilla, one (4%) was posterior and 20 (80%) were at the level of the axilla of the middle turbinate. The mean difference of distance from the nasal sill to the anterior edge of the lacrimal sac (from its mid-height) was 39.04 (±4.92) mm. The mean difference of distance from the nasal sill to the posterior edge of the lacrimal sac (from its mid-height) was 45.50 (±4.47) mm. The mean of width and length of the lacrimal sac was 7.54 (±1.44) mm and 13.16 (±5.37) mm, respectively. The mean difference of distance from the anterior edge of the lacrimal sac to the posterior edge of the uncinate process was 14.06 (±3.00) mm, while the mean difference of distance from the anterior nasal spine to the anterior edge of the lacrimal sac (from its mid-height) was 37.20 (±5.37) mm.The mean height of the fundus was 3.26 (±1.09) mm. The mean difference of distance from the superior punctum to the fundus was 12.70 (±1.45) mm, and from the inferior punctum to the fundus was 11.10 (±2.02) mm.
