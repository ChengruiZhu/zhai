 have a thick protective outer membrane that helps them to withstand adverse conditions both outside and within the host. However, in order to cause disease, the bacterium also needs to secrete proteins across this outer membrane. To achieve this, mycobacteria possess so-called type VII secretion systems. One of these systems, the ESX-5 secretion system, is only present in the group of slow-growing mycobacteria, which contains most pathogenic species. In this study, we show that the ESX-5 system is essential for growth of mycobacteria. We found that when we generated a ‘leaky’ outer membrane, by interfering in the construction of the outer membrane, or by introducing an outer membrane porin, the ESX-5 system was no longer essential for growth. We additionally show that ESX-5 mediates uptake of fatty acids, which suggests that ESX-5 substrates can form specific transport systems or pores in the outer membrane required for the uptake of crucial nutrients. Understanding the role of ESX-5 in outer membrane permeability helps us to understand a fundamental difference between fast-growing and slow-growing mycobacteria. Since most pathogenic mycobacteria are slow-growing this helps us to understand the mycobacterial requirements for pathogenesis in more detail.
