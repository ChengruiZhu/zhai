Nineteen children were admitted by AFP. Six confirmed as AFM: age 40(±22.6) months; 66% female, 50% had history of recurrent wheezing. Prodrome: 100% Upper Respiratory Tract Infection(URTI); 4/6(66%) fever; 1/6(16%) vomiting and abdominal pain. Neurological symptoms appeared 5.2(±6) days after prodrome. All children had acute progressive asymmetric limbs weakness, areflexia, intact sensitivity and severe muscles pain; 5/6(83%) had neck muscles weakness; 3/6(50%) had severe respiratory failure: 2 mechanical ventilation and 1 noninvasive ventilatory assistance; 3/6(50%) needed feeding support; 2/6(33.3%) had cranial nerve dysfunction. None had cognitive disability. CFS findings: 5/6 mononuclear pleocytosis; 2/6 increase of proteins and 1/6 albuminocytological dissociation. Spinal cord lesions in MRI was observed in all patients. EMG showed early signs of denervation and low motor neuron in 5/5 patient. Virology: enterovirus could be identified by RT-nested – PCR and genomic sequencing from nasopharyngeal-swab in 5/6(83%); 4/5 typified as EVD68, in 1/5 viral charge was low for typing. Stool samples: EVD68 was identified in 2/6(33%). CSF samples were negative. Treatment: IV immunoglobulin 5/6(83%) patient; 2/6(33%) systemic corticosteroids; 3/6(50%) required ICU admission. All patients had neurologic motor sequelae; 2/6 remain with chronical ventilatory assistance after 6 months of follow-up. None patient dye.
