The interaction of Ca2+ and Ba2+ with a Ca2+-activated K+ channel from rabbit skeletal muscle membranes is studied in planar lipid bilayers. At [Ca2+] greater than or equal to 100 microM in the cis side (the side to which the vesicles are added) and at positive voltages, the channel kinetics consisted of bursts of activity interrupted by long periods of quiescence. We found that the reciprocal of the mean burst time increases linearly with [Ca2+], whereas the mean time for the quiescent (closed) periods is independent of [Ca2+]. The number of quiescent periods is reduced by increasing [K+]. Micromolar amounts of cis Ba2+ do not activate the channel, but induce similar "slow" closings. Also, in this case, the mean burst time is inversely proportional to the [Ba2+] and the mean closed time is independent of [Ba2+]. Raising [K+] either symmetrically or only in the trans side relieved the Ba2+ effect. trans Ba2+ also induces changes in the slow kinetics, but in millimolar amounts. These results suggest that the quiescent periods correspond to a channel blocked by a Ba ion. The voltage dependence of the cis blockade indicates that the Ba2+ binding site is past the middle of the membrane field. The similarities in the slow kinetics induced by Ca2+ and Ba2+ suggest that Ca2+ blocks the channel by binding to the same site. However, binding of Ca2+ to the site is 10(5)- fold weaker.
