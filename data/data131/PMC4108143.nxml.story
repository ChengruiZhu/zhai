Vernal keratoconjunctivitis (VKC) is a relatively rare, chronic form of ocular allergy that can potentially cause severe visual complications. Affecting mainly children and young adults, it is an IgE- and T cell-mediated disease, leading to a chronic inflammation in which eosinophil, lymphocyte and structural cell activation are involved. Treatment of VKC requires a multiple approach that includes conservative measures and pharmacologic treatment. Patients and parents should be made aware of the long duration of disease, its chronic evolution and possible complications. Treatment should be based on the duration and frequency of symptoms and the severity of corneal involvement. Mast cell stabilizers and antihistamines have been proven to be effective for the treatment of mild to moderate forms of VKC. In the most severe cases, topical steroids can be used as rescue medication to reduce conjunctival and corneal inflammation. Immunomodulators that have been investigated for VKC treatment include topical ocular preparations of cyclosporine A and tacrolimus. Topical cyclosporine A has been proven to be effective in the long-term treatment of VKC, significantly improving signs and symptoms without significant side effects.
