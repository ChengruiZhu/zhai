Patients often show varied drug responses ranging from lack of therapeutic efficacy to life-threatening adverse drug reactions. Drug therapy would be greatly improved if it were possible to predict individual drug sensitivity and tailor drugs to patients' genetic makeup. Like all other organisms, humans have a set of transporters and enzymes to detoxify and eliminate foreign molecules including drugs. Understanding the function of genetic variants in these proteins is a key goal toward personalized medicine. To that end, we examined the functional consequences of naturally occurring genetic variants in P-glycoprotein, the most versatile human multidrug transporter. A novel method was developed and employed that can identify function-altering variants in human transporters. This methodology was robust and powerful in that the functional effect of genetic variants can be directly assessed in yeast where all confounding variables in humans are excluded. Surprisingly, the majority of single amino acid substitutions were found to cause alterations in resistance to three tested anticancer agents. This study extends the impact of yeast-based medical research to a new niche, pharmacogenomics.
