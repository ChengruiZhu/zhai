 gene product, known as viral IL-10 (vIL-10). Although these cytokines share many immunosuppressive properties, vIL-10 lacks several of the immunostimulatory activities of cIL-10 on certain cell types. The molecular and cellular bases for this dichotomy are not currently defined. Here, we show that the single amino acid isoleucine at position 87 of cIL-10 is required for its immunostimulatory function. Substitution of isoleucine in cIL-10 with alanine, which corresponds to the vIL-10 residue, abrogates immunostimulatory activity for thymocytes, mast cells, and alloantigenic responses while preserving immunosuppressive activity for inhibition of interferon γ production and prolongation of cardiac allograft survival. Conversely, substitution of alanine with isoleucine in vIL-10 converts it to a cIL-10–like molecule with immunostimulatory activity. This single conservative residue alteration significantly affects ligand affinity for receptor; however, affinity changes do not necessarily alter specific activities for biologic responses in a predictable fashion. These results suggest complex regulation of IL-10 receptor–ligand interactions and subsequent biological responses. These results demonstrate that vIL-10 may represent a captured and selectively mutated cIL-10 gene that benefits viral pathogenesis by leading to ineffective host immune responses. The ability to manipulate the activity of IL-10 in either a stimulatory or suppressive direction may be of practical value for regulating immune responses for disease therapy, and of theoretical value for determining what aspects of IL-10 activity are important for normal T cell responses.
