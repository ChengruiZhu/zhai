The development of the human skeleton is regulated by intricate signaling pathways involving secreted molecules that bind to cell surface receptors to elicit a response in the target cell. Bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) are an important part of this process. Their signaling capacity is regulated on several levels including the extracellular space where inhibitors such as Noggin prevent BMPs from binding to their cognate receptors. We here describe that specific mutations of a single amino acid in GDF5, a member of the BMP family, cause congenital fusion of joints. Investigating the effect of the mutation in detail, we can show that the mutant GDF5 is no longer inhibited by Noggin, thus providing a functional explanation for the patients' phenotype. Furthermore, we show that the mutated residue (N445) is conserved throughout the BMP family, with the exception of BMP9 and BMP10, that carry the same amino acid at this position as the mutant GDF5. Both are, just as the mutant, resistant to inhibition by Noggin. Variants of BMPs that are insensitive to antagonists may induce bone formation more effectively, providing a source for effective, low-dose therapeutics for clinical applications.
