Protein-mediated self-assembly is arguably one of the most promising routes for building complex molecular nanostructures. Here, we report a molecular self-assembly technique that allows programmable, site-specific patterning of double-stranded DNA scaffolds, at a single-base resolution, by 3-nm-long RecA-based nucleoprotein filaments. RecA proteins bind to single-stranded DNA to form nucleoprotein filaments. These can self-assemble onto a double-stranded DNA scaffold at a region homologous to the nucleoproteinâ€™s single-stranded DNA sequence. We demonstrate that nucleoprotein filaments can be formed from single-stranded DNA molecules ranging in length from 60 nucleotides down to just 6 nucleotides, and these can be assembled site-specifically onto a model DNA scaffold both at the end of the scaffold and away from the end. In both cases, successful site-specific self-assembly is demonstrated even for the smallest nucleoprotein filaments, which are just 3 nm long, comprise only two monomers of RecA, and cover less than one helical turn of the double-stranded DNA scaffold. Finally, we demonstrate that the RecA-mediated assembly process is highly site-specific and that the filaments indeed bind only to the homologous region of the DNA scaffold, leaving the neighboring scaffold exposed.
