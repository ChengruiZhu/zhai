Long Interspersed Element-1 (LINE-1 or L1) sequences are the predominant class of autonomous retrotransposons in the human genome and comprise an astounding 17% of human DNA. Although the majority of L1s are considered to be “dead,” an average human genome contains ∼80–100 active L1s. Active L1s encode two proteins (ORF1p and ORF2p) that are required for mobility (retrotransposition) by a “copy and paste” mechanism termed target-site primed reverse transcription. Prior experiments suggested that ORF1p, ORF2p reverse transcriptase activity, and L1 mRNA associate in ribonucleoprotein (RNP) particles and that RNP formation is a necessary step in L1 retrotransposition. However, the difficulty in detecting ORF2p from engineered human L1s has prevented a thorough understanding of its role in L1 retrotransposition. Here, we have exploited epitope and/or RNA–tagging strategies to detect and characterize a “basal” RNP complex from engineered human L1s. We also expanded on previous studies and characterized how mutations in conserved functional domains of ORF1p and ORF2p can adversely affect L1 RNP formation/function. Finally, our strategy allowed us to detect the L1–encoded proteins and L1 RNA in cytoplasmic foci. Thus, we have developed and employed a system to gain greater understanding of LINE-1 retrotransposition at the molecular level.
