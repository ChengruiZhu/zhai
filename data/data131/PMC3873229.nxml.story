Plants deploy plasma membrane immune receptors to survey their environment for potential threats. One of these receptors, FLAGELIN SENSING 2 (FLS2) recognizes bacterial flagellin (flg22) and thereby triggers a multitude of defense responses, enhancing immunity against infectious pathogens. Regulation of the subcellular localization of FLS2 is therefore an important aspect in plant disease resistance. FLS2 is known to shuttle between the plasma membrane and endosomal compartments but enters the late endosomal trafficking pathway upon ligand-dependent activation. A key question is the regulation of activated FLS2 in late endosomal trafficking. Here, we show that FLS2 is internalized into the lumen of multivesicular bodies and discovered by genetic inhibition that this step is regulated by components of the ENDOSOMAL SORTING COMPLEXES REQUIRED FOR TRANSPORT-I (ESCRT-I). Furthermore, we reveal that these ESCRT-I components play crucial roles in plant immunity impacting the flg22-triggered closure of stomata, prominent entry points of pathogenic bacteria, which occurred downstream of the known flg22 responses. These findings highlight the roles of endosomal trafficking in regulating FLS2 subcellular localization and plant immunity.
