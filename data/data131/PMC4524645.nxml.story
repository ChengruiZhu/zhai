The placenta is vital for the proper development of the fetus, not only facilitating the exchange of nutrients, oxygen, and waste between the mother and the fetus but also acting as an interface to the maternal immune system and regulating fetal growth by excreting hormones and growth factors. DNA methylation is important for both placental and embryonic development as loss of proteins involved in DNA methylation can result in placental dysmorphology and early embryonic death. The human placenta has a unique DNA methylation landscape characterized by alternating regions of low methylation, covering silent genes with tissue-specific developmental functions, and high methylation, covering active genes. In order to better understand the significance of this DNA methylation landscape in the human placenta, we performed a cross-species comparison of DNA methylation in mammalian placentas, oocytes, and early embryos from this and other studies. Although the levels and extent of hypomethylation differed between mammalian placentas, what we found to be highly conserved was relatively higher methylation levels over active genes. These same genes also had high methylation in the opossum extraembryonic membrane, a primitive placenta, as well as oocytes and early embryos, suggesting that high methylation over these genes predated placental mammals and is established very early in development.
