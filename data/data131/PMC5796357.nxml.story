. The MCF-7C cell line was established by dose stepwise induction beginning with a low concentration of OHT; the MCF-7T cell line was established by temporal stepwise induction beginning with a high concentration of OHT. Differential miRNA expression profiles between TAM-sensitive (MCF-7) and TAM-resistant (MCF-7C and MCF-7T) breast cancer cell lines were detected and analyzed using RNA sequencing technology. The results of western blot analysis indicated that the level of ERÎ± protein expression in drug-resistant cells was significantly increased. A total of 1,646 miRNAs were detected in all samples, including 1,376 known miRNAs and 270 predicted miRNAs. There were 118 miRNAs expressed at significantly different levels between MCF-7C and MCF-7 cells (P<0.05); among them, 67 miRNAs were upregulated (P<0.05) and 51 miRNA were downregulated (P<0.05). There were 42 miRNAs expressed at significantly different levels between MCF-7T and MCF-7 (P<0.05); among them, 23 miRNAs were upregulated (P<0.05) and 19 miRNAs were downregulated (P<0.05). There were 126 miRNAs with significant differences between MCF-7C and MCF-7T (P<0.05); among them, 76 miRNAs were upregulated (P<0.05) and 50 miRNAs were downregulated. On the basis of the results of the present study, we hypothesize that miR-21, miR-146a, miR-148a, miR-34a and miR-27a may serve important roles in mediating TAM resistance in breast cancer, and have potential as therapeutic targets for TAM-resistant breast cancer.
