The present study aimed to determine the association between changes in Zbtb7a expression levels and heterogeneity of nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) CNE3 sublines. CNE3 sublines were established by screening of serial dilution and continuous passage. Proliferative ability and tumorigenicity of the sublines were analyzed separately by soft-agar colony formation and mouse studies. The NPC tissues from mice were analyzed by histological evaluation and immunohistochemistry. The expression levels of Zbtb7a mRNA and protein were analyzed separately by quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction and western blotting. According to findings from the soft-agar colony formation and mouse studies, two sublines with increased tumorigenicity compared with other sublines were transfected transiently with Zbtb7a short hairpin RNA (shRNA) recombinant plasmid. The changes in viability, migration and invasion abilities were evaluated separately by MTT, colorimetric focus-formation, Transwell migration and invasion assays. The sublines CNE3-GX6 and CNE3-GX11 were selected for subsequent study due to increased tumorigenicity and increased Zbtb7a expression levels compared with the other sublines. High metastatic potency was not observed in all of the sublines. Zbtb7a expression levels were positively associated with tumorigenic degree of the sublines. The growth, migration and invasion abilities of the sublines transfected with Zbtb7a shRNA plasmid were decreased compared with the cells transfected with empty vector in the negative control group. The findings suggest Zbtb7a expression levels may be associated with heterogeneity of CNE3 sublines. Therefore, Zbtb7a may have an important role in the regulatory mechanism of NPC heterogeneity.
