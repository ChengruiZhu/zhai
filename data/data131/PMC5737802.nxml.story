Evidence over the past decades has found that stress, particularly through the corticosterone stress hormones, produces complex changes in glutamatergic signaling in prefrontal cortex, which leads to the alteration of cognitive processes medicated by this brain region. Interestingly, the effects of stress on glutamatergic transmission appear to be “U-shaped,” depending upon the duration and severity of the stressor. These biphasic effects of acute vs chronic stress represent the adaptive vs maladaptive responses to stressful stimuli. Animal studies suggest that the stress-induced modulation of excitatory synaptic transmission involves changes in presynaptic glutamate release, postsynaptic glutamate receptor membrane trafficking and degradation, spine structure and cytoskeleton network, and epigenetic control of gene expression. This review will discuss current findings on the key molecules involved in the stress-induced regulation of prefrontal cortex synaptic physiology and prefrontal cortex-mediated functions. Understanding the molecular and epigenetic mechanisms that underlie the complex effects of stress will help to develop novel strategies to cope with stress-related mental disorders.
