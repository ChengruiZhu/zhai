Cultured bovine adrenal medullary chromaffin cells were stimulated to secrete catecholamines by addition of veratridine or nicotine. The formation of an exocytotic pit exposes a major secretory granule membrane antigen, the enzyme dopamine beta-hydroxylase, to the external medium. By including antiserum to this enzyme in the medium, we were able to visualize sites of exocytosis by decoration of bound antibody using a fluorescent second antibody. Internalization of this antibody- antigen complex was then followed in chase experiments: approximately half the surface complex was internalized in 15-30 min. In other experiments, secretion was triggered in the absence of antiserum, and surface enzyme was revealed by binding antibodies at various times after secretion had been halted by an antagonist. Surface patches of antigen remained discrete from the bulk of the plasma membrane for at least 30 min, although a substantial proportion of the antigen was internalized within this time. Cell surface concanavalin A receptors were internalized at a roughly similar rate, suggesting that mechanisms may be similar. After internalization, chromaffin granule membranes fused to larger structures, possibly lysosomes, and were transported over a few hours to the perinuclear region of the cell.
