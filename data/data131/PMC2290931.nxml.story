Leukocyte interactions with vascular endothelium at sites of inflammation can be dynamically regulated by activation-dependent adhesion molecules. Current models, primarily based on studies with polymorphonuclear leukocytes, suggest the involvement of multiple members of the selectin, integrin, and immunoglobulin gene families, sequentially, in the process of initial attachment (rolling), stable adhesion (arrest), spreading and ultimate diapedesis. In the current study, IL-4-activated human umbilical vein endothelium, which selectively expresses VCAM-1 and an L-selectin ligand but not E- selectin, and appropriate function blocking monoclonal antibodies, were used to study monocyte-endothelial interactions in an in vitro model that mimics microcirculatory flow conditions. In this system, L- selectin mediates monocyte rolling and also facilitates alpha 4 beta 1- integrin-dependent arrest, whereas beta 2-integrins are required for spreading of firmly attached monocytes on the endothelial cell surface but not their arrest. These findings provide the first in vitro evidence for human monocyte rolling on cytokine-activated endothelium, and suggest a sequential requirement for both beta 1- and beta 2- integrin-dependent adhesive mechanisms in monocyte-endothelial interactions.
