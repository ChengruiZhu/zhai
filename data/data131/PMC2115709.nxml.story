Immunolocalization of monoclonal antibodies to Acanthamoeba myosin I showed a cross-reactive protein in nuclei (Hagen, S. J., D. P. Kiehart, D. A. Kaiser, and T. D. Pollard. 1986. J. Cell Biol. 103:2121-2128). This protein is antigenically related to myosin I in that nine monoclonal antibodies and three polyclonal antibodies are cross- reactive. However, studies with affinity-purified antibodies and two- dimensional peptide maps show that the protein is not a proteolytic product of myosin I. We have used cell fractionation and column chromatography to purify this protein. It is a dimer of 34-kD polypeptides with a Stokes' radius of 4 nm. A polyclonal antisera generated against the purified protein confirms the nuclear localization seen with the cross-reactive monoclonal antibodies. The 34- kD protein binds actin filaments in an ATP-insensitive manner with a Kd of approximately 0.25 microM without cross-linking, severing, or capping. No ATPase activity was detected in the presence or absence of actin. It also binds to DNA. These unique properties suggest we have discovered a new class of actin-binding protein. We have given this protein the name NAB for "nuclear actin-binding" protein.
