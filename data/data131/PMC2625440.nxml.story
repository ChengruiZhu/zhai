An important class of chemotherapeutic drugs used in the treatment of cancer induces DNA damage that interferes with DNA replication. The resulting block to replication results in the formation of single-strand gaps in DNA. These gaps can be filled by specialized DNA polymerases, a process associated with the introduction of mutations or by recombination with an undamaged segment of DNA with an identical or similar sequence. Our work shows that diversification of the antibody genes in the chicken B cell line DT40, which is initiated by localized replication-stalling DNA damage, proceeds by formation of a single-strand intermediate. These gaps are generated by the action of a specific nuclease complex, comprising the Mre11, Rad50, and Nbs1 proteins, which have previously been implicated in the initiation of homologous recombination from double-strand breaks. However, in this context, their dysfunction can be reversed by the expression of a bacterial single-strandâ€“specific nuclease, SbcB. Antibody diversification in DT40 thus provides an excellent model for studying the process of replication-stalling DNA damage and will allow a more detailed understanding of the mechanisms underlying gap repair and cellular tolerance of chemotherapeutic agents.
