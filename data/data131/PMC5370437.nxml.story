This review aimed to summarize the current research contents about long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) and some related lncRNAs as molecular biomarkers or therapy strategies in human cancer and cardiovascular diseases. Following the development of various kinds of sequencing technologies, lncRNAs have become one of the most unknown areas that need to be explored. First, the definition and classification of lncRNAs were constantly amended and supplemented because of their complexity and diversity. Second, several methods and strategies have been developed to study the characteristic of lncRNAs, including new species identifications, subcellular localization, gain or loss of function, molecular interaction, and bioinformatics analysis. Third, based on the present results from basic researches, the working mechanisms of lncRNAs were proved to be different forms of interactions involving DNAs, RNAs, and proteins. Fourth, lncRNA can play different important roles during the embryogenesis and organ differentiations. Finally, because of the tissue-specific expression of lncRNAs, they could be used as biomarkers or therapy targets and effectively applied in different kinds of diseases, such as human cancer and cardiovascular diseases.
