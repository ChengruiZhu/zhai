In eukaryotic cells, the RNA polymerase II (Pol II) is a central enzyme that reads the genetic information encoded in the DNA template to synthetize a messenger RNA. To perform its function, Pol II needs to have the substrate nucleoside triphosphate (NTP) diffuse into its deeply buried active site. Despite numerous efforts, the NTP entry routes remain elusive: NTP could diffuse only through the secondary channel, or also via the main channel. The structural information of the transcription bubble is essential to study this process, however, the unpaired non-template DNA of the transcription bubble is absent in the available X-ray crystal structures. In this regard, we have built a structural model of the Pol II elongation complex with reconstructed transcription bubble using existing experimental data. We then performed Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations and applied structural analysis to study the routes of NTP diffusion. We found that sterically the probability of NTP loading through the secondary channel is more than twice that of the main channel. Further analysis of the non-bonded energetic contributions to NTP diffusion suggests that NTP diffusion through the main channel is greatly disfavored by the electrostatic repulsion between the substrate and negatively charged backbones of nucleotides in the non-template strand of the transcription bubble. Altogether, our findings suggest that the secondary channel is the more favorable NTP diffusion route for Pol II transcription elongation.
