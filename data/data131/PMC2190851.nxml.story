We analyzed the molecular mechanism for the immunoglobulin (Ig) multiple isotype expression using a transgenic mouse (TG.SA) model system. Though most of the endogenous mu chain expression was excluded by the expression of the human rearranged mu transgene in the TG.SA mouse, a significant portion of splenic B lymphocytes could express the transgenic human IgM and endogenous mouse IgG simultaneously after stimulation with lipopolysaccharide and interleukin 4. The fluorescence- activated cell sorter-purified population of the human IgM+/mouse IgG+ cells expressed mRNA that consisted of properly spliced sequences of the transgenic VHDJH and the endogenous mouse C gamma genes (trans- mRNA), together with the transgenic human mu mRNA and germline transcripts of the mouse C gamma gene, without apparent rearrangement of the transgene. We also found that a lymphoma tumor, derived from the cross between the TG.SA mouse and another transgenic mouse carrying Ig H chain enhancer-driven c-myc oncogene, expressed about equal levels of the trans-mRNA and the transgenic mu mRNA without DNA rearrangement in either the transgene or the endogenous mouse switch region. These findings strongly support our previous proposal that the trans-splicing can account for the multiple isotype expression in this transgenic model and also suggest that novel molecular mechanism(s) might be involved in this reaction.
