Polychlorinated naphthalenes (PCNs) are the smallest chlorinated polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (Cl-PAHs) and are often called dioxin-like compounds. Chlorophenols (CPs) are important precursors of PCN formation. In this paper, mechanistic and kinetic studies on the homogeneous gas-phase formation mechanism of PCNs from 3-CP precursor were investigated theoretically by using the density functional theory (DFT) method and canonical variational transition-state theory (CVT) with small curvature tunneling contribution (SCT). The reaction priority of different PCN formation pathways were disscussed. The rate constants of crucial elementary steps were deduced over a wide temperature range of 600âˆ’1200 K. The mechanisms were compared with the experimental observation and our previous works on the PCN formation from 2-CP and 4-CP. This study shows that pathways ended with Cl elimination are favored over those ended with H elimination from the 3-CP precursor. The formation potential of MCN is larger than that of DCN. The chlorine substitution pattern of monochlorophenols has a significant effect on isomer patterns and formation potential of PCN products. The results can be input into the environmental PCN controlling and prediction models as detailed parameters, which can be used to confirm the formation routes of PCNs, reduce PCN emission and establish PCN controlling strategies.
