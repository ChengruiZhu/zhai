Epidemiological studies have reported associations between traditional cardiovascular risk factors and carotid intima-media thickness (CIMT) or carotid plaque. However, definite risk factors at different phases of carotid atherosclerosis remain controversial. We aimed to explore risk factors and characteristics of carotid atherosclerosis at different stages in a low-income population with a high incidence of stroke in China. Between April 2014 and January 2015, we recruited 3789 stroke-free and cardiovascular disease-free residents aged â‰¥ 45 years. B-mode ultrasonography was performed to measure CIMT and the presence of carotid plaque. Traditional risk factors were compared between the increased CIMT group and normal CIMT group, and between those with and without carotid plaque. A total of 3789 participants were assessed in this study, with a mean age (standard deviation) of 59.92 (9.70) years. The prevalence of increased CIMT and carotid plaque increased with older age and higher education levels. Age, hypertension, diabetes, and high low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels were risk factors for increased CIMT and carotid plaque. Furthermore, compared to never smoking, passive smoking was positively associated with increased CIMT, with an odds ratio (95% confidence interval) of 1.26 (1.05, 1.53;
