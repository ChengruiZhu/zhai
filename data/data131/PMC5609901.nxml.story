Type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM2) is associated with cardiovascular complications and is characterized by high levels of YKL-40, an inflammatory glycoprotein involved in endothelial dysfunction. We investigated the predictive potential of circulating miR-24 in coronary heart diseases (CHD) DM2 patients with CHD, and control subjects. Blood samples were taken from 94 subjects of both genders, and divided over three groups as follows; patients with CHD, patients with DM2 and CHD, and control subjects. Both miR-24 (using real time PCR) and routine parameters were measured. Using bioinformatic analysis and luciferase assays, we found that miR-24 has high complementarity and a high degree of species conservation with respect to the binding sites within the 3â€² UTR of the YKL-40 mRNA. The expression levels of circulating miR-24, determined by quantitative real time PCR, were significantly decreased in peripheral blood of DM2-CHD and CHD patients compared with controls. Furthermore, miR-24 strongly associated with DM2-CHD, negatively correlated with YKL-40 in DM2-CHD and DM2 patients after conducting multiple regression analysis. These results provide a novel regulatory mechanism of circulating miR-24 in regulating YKL-40 levels in DM2-CHD, may serve as a biomarker for predicting patients with DM2 and CHD.
