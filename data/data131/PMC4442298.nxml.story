We compared the immunoprofile of pituitary adenomas from Romania and Moldova. One hundred and eighty cases coming from Romania (94 cases, group 1) and Moldova (86 cases, group 2) were assessed by immunohistochemistry regarding all six basic hormones expressed in pituitary adenomas. Specific differences and similarities were found and stated for both groups. In group 1, 70% of cases were pituitary adenomas positive for one hormone, 13% were plurihormonal, while 17% were negative. In group 2, 50,3% of the cases expressed only one hormone and 12,5% were negative for all hormones. The highest difference was observed for plurihormonal adenomas, found in about 37,2% of cases for group 2 (2.86 times higher for group 2 compared with group 1). A higher incidence of GH-secreting adenomas characterized group “1,” while group “2” had the highest percent of LH-secreting adenomas, 55% of cases being positive. Triple association was noticed in 4.25% of cases of group 1 and in 8,13% out of total cases, from group 2. Four-hormone association was found only in group 2, noticed in 15,56% of the cases. The present paper highlights strong evidences of a particular and different immunoprofile of pituitary adenomas coming from Romania and Moldova.
