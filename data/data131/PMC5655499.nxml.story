-acylation-independent functions, was recently shown to bind at least six proteins, by specific recognition of a consensus sequence in them. To further refine the rules governing binding to the AR of zDHHC17, we employed peptide arrays based on zDHHC AR-binding motif (zDABM) sequences of synaptosomal-associated protein 25 (SNAP25) and cysteine string protein α (CSPα). Quantitative comparisons of the binding preferences of 400 peptides allowed us to construct a position-specific scoring matrix (PSSM) for zDHHC17 AR binding, with which we predicted and subsequently validated many putative zDHHC17 interactors. We identified 95 human zDABM sequences with unexpected versatility in amino acid usage; these sequences were distributed among 90 proteins, of which 62 have not been previously implicated in zDHHC17/13 binding. These zDABM-containing proteins included all family members of the SNAP25, sprouty, cornifelin, ankyrin, and SLAIN-motif containing families; seven endogenous Gag polyproteins sharing the same binding sequence; and several proteins involved in cytoskeletal organization, cell communication, and regulation of signaling. A dozen of the zDABM-containing proteins had more than one zDABM sequence, whereas isoform-specific binding to the AR of zDHHC17 was identified for the Ena/VASP-like protein. The large number of zDABM sequences within the human proteome suggests that zDHHC17 may be an interaction hub regulating many cellular processes.
