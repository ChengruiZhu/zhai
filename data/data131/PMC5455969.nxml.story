The final cohort consisted of 301 patients (response rate 80%), with 24 patients (6.5%) dissatisfied with the result of TKR. Persistent pain was the most common reason for dissatisfaction (n=10). Dissatisfied patients reported a significantly (P = 0.03) higher mean PCS score (mean±SD, 11.3±10.3), compared to satisfied patients (5.4±6.3) and a significantly (P = 0.02) higher depression component of the DASS (3.5±3.3 vs 1.4±1.6). In addition, dissatisfied patients returned a significantly (P = 0.02) lower internal locus of control (16.6±8.2 vs 21.3±8.2). The dissatisfied group also exhibited a reduced improvement in the OKS and ROM, as well as a lower preoperative grade of osteoarthritis compared to satisfied patients. Preliminary analysis revealed that five patients (21%) became satisfied with their knee despite no intervention occurring between measurements. Of the remaining patients, five patients (21%) did not think their ongoing issues were severe enough to warrant further intervention, and nine patients (38%) were referred directly to the program. It is expected that these results will shed new light on the potential management options for these patients that identify as dissatisfied after a primary unilateral TKR.
