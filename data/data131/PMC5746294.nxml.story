M atorvastatin for 24 h. Proliferation was detected by MTT assay, cell counting, 5-ethynyl-2′-deoxyuridine assay and real-time cell analyzer. Mitochondrial energy metabolism including oxygen consumption rate and extracellular acidification rate were measured using a Seahorse metabolic flux analyzer. Mitochondrial membrane potential was detected under fluorescence microscope following staining with tetramethylrhodamine. Respiratory chain complexes I–V were detected using western blotting. The current study showed that Ang II inhibits the proliferation of HUVECs. Results from the Seahorse metabolic flux analyzer indicated that Ang II decreased basal oxygen consumption, maximal respiration capacity, spare respiration capacity, adenosine triphosphate-linked respiration and non-mitochondrial respiration. By contrast, Ang II increased the proton leak. Additionally, Ang II increased glycolysis, glycolytic capacity and non-glycolytic acidification. Furthermore, these effects were all suppressed by atorvastatin. The results indicated that atorvastatin prevents cellular energy metabolism switching from oxidative phosphorylation to glycolysis induced by Ang II and protected the proliferative ability of HUVECs.
