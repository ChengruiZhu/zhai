Ossifying fibroma is a rare benign osteogenic neoplasm arising from undifferentiated cells of the periodontal ligament. Ossifying fibroma have a well-defined border that differentiates it from fibrous dysplasia clinically, these tumors manifest as a round or ovoid, expansile, painless, slow-growing mass may displace the roots of adjacent teeth and also cause root resorption. They occur at second to fourth decade of life. Radiologically the lesion appears as a dense radiopaque mass surrounded by a thin, well-defined regular radiolucent rim. Patient underwent thorough history taking and complete face, ear, nose, and throat examination. Computed tomography maxilla, orthopantomogram, paranasal sinus reveals entire maxillary sinus involved in one case. Nasal septum deviated to the opposite side, airway reduced on the side of swelling seen in one case. Root resorption seen in two cases and missing teeth in seen in case 1. In our study in case 1, the tumor involved maxillary sinus, medial wall of the nose. The tumors were excised by Weberâ€“Fergusson and in case 2 the tumor was excised by maxillary vestibular approach. Overall recurrence rates after resection is reported to range from 30 to 56%.
