 The present studies have established conditions for the demonstration of cooperative interactions between specific T and B lymphocyte populations in the development of IgE antibody responses in vivo in mice. This has been accomplished by utilizing a system which permits the successful adoptive transfer to irradiated recipients of DNP-specific secondary IgE responses with spleen cells from suitably primed syngeneic donor mice. Thus, adoptively transferred DNP-KLH or DNP-ASC-primed spleen cells produced high levels of anti-DNP antibodies of both IgE and IgG antibody classes in response to challenge with the appropriate homologous priming conjugate but failed to develop more than meager responses to the reciprocal heterologous conjugate. However, when spleen cells from donors primed to the second carrier were concomitantly transferred with hapten-primed lymphocytes, secondary IgE ant-DNP responses were consistently obtained upon challenge with the heterologous conjugate. Moreover, we have been able to elicit augmented primary IgE anti-DNP antibody responses to either DNP-ASC or DNP-KLH after adoptive transfer of spleen cells from donors primed only to the carrier, ASC or KLH, respectively. This adoptive transfer system has enabled us to provide direct proof for the participation of θ-bearing T lymphocytes in antibody responses of the IgE class. Thus, the capacity of ASC-primed spleen cells to effectively cooperate with the DNP-KLH-primed lymphocytes in the adoptive secondary response to DNP-ASC could be abolished by in vitro treatment of such cells with anti-θ serum plus complement. This was true not only for the anti-DNP response of the IgG antibody class, but for the IgE antibody class as well. These studies have, furthermore, demonstrated the capacity to stimulate secondary anti-DNP antibody production in vivo by the concomitant administration of the DNP and relevant carrier determinants on separate molecules. This was more readily seen in the IgE than in the IgG antibody class. Thus, DNP-ASC-primed cells developed significant IgE, but more variable IgG, anti-DNP responses upon challenge with DNP-KLH plus unconjugated ASC. Antibody responses of both classes elicited in this manner were appreciably improved by the transfer of additional carrier (ASC)-primed cells. These and other results presented herein suggest that IgE B lymphocyte precursors may be inherently more sensitive than IgG B cells to at least certain of the functions of T lymphocytes concerned with regulatory mechanisms involved in antibody production.
