Cells regulate the packaging of DNA in the chromatin, and an important process in the development of any eukaryote is the definition of chromatin states. Heterochromatin is a condensed form of chromatin that is usually silent. Short non-coding RNAs participate in the silencing of transposons in animal germ cells and in the establishment of heterochromatin states during early development. These non-coding RNAs guide histone methyltransferases to the histones in the chromatin, which in turn creates binding sites for other factors that keep the heterochromatin condensed. The non-coding RNAs that participate in the establishment of heterochromatic domains are active in germ cells and gonads, and other mechanisms must exist in animal somatic tissues to maintain the established patterns of heterochromatin throughout development. Here, we identify RRP6 as a protein that is necessary for maintaining the condensed state of heterochromatin in a subset of heterochromatic loci in the somatic fruitfly genome. RRP6 is a ribonuclease that plays many roles in RNA processing and in quality control of gene expression. We show that RRP6 is tethered to heterochromatin through an interaction with a histone methyltransferase, and that in the heterochromatin RRP6 acts on transcripts derived from repetitive sequences that need to be degraded to maintain the packaging of the heterochromatin. The importance of ribonucleases for the structure of the heterochromatin had been shown in yeast cells. Our findings show that RNA degradation participates in chromatin silencing also in animal cells.
