Methylmercury (MeHg) is one of the most toxic mercury species, which can cause many systemic damages, but little is known about its effect in the salivary glands. This study aimed to analyze the mercury levels, oxidative stress, and proteomic profile in parotid, submandibular, and sublingual salivary glands of rats, after chronic MeHg intoxication. Two groups of twenty male Wistar rats (90 days of age) were used on the experiment. MeHg group was intoxicated by intragastric gavage with MeHg at a dose of 0.04â€‰mg/kg/day for 60 days, while the control group received only oil. After the period of intoxication, the glands were collected for evaluation of total mercury levels, proteomic profile, and oxidative balance by analyzing the antioxidant capacity against peroxyl radicals (ACAP), lipid peroxidation (LPO), and nitrite levels. Our results have showed that mercury levels were significant in all three glands compared to the respective control. It also showed lower levels of ACAP, as well as higher LPO and nitrite levels. The proteomic profile presented impairments on structural components of cytoskeleton, metabolic pathways, and oxidative biochemistry. Thus, the exposure to MeHg was able to generate oxidative stress that could be associated with changes in the proteomic profile of salivary glands.
