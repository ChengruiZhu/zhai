Background and aims: Capsule endoscopy (CE) represents a novel method which allows safe, non-invasive and rapid exploration of the small bowel. Our aim was to determine the feasibility CE has in assessing tumoral pathology of the small bowel and aiding surgical teams in determining appropriate treatment. Material and Method Our study was conducted on 11 patients who presented tumoral pathology of the small bowel, from a total of 50 patients investigated by VCE. Malignancy was determined on the surgical resection piece, by histological exam. Statistic analysis of the data was conducted using Fisherâ€™s Exact Test. Results Tumoral pathology was represented by: 3 intestinal polyps, 2 benign stromal tumors, 2 malign stromal tumors, 2 adenocarcinomas, one neuroendocrine malign tumor and one duodenal papilla carcinoma. We followed the presence of malign tumors in regards to age. All malign tumors (n=6) were recorded in patients over 60 years old, while benign tumors were recorded in most cases (80%, n=4) in people under 60 years old. One case of benign tumor (intestinal polyp) was observed above 60 years old. Conclusion Capsule endoscopy represents a real help for the surgeon, as it allows identification of small bowel pathology, giving information regarding the approximate localization of lesions, their size and orienting on their nature. Tumoral pathology is encountered mainly with the old age population and can be presented under a multitude of forms. We believe that an efficient method for incipient detection and a protocol to establish malignity is necessary.
