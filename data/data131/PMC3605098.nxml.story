Selection during the evolution of crop plants has resulted in dramatic phenotypic differentiation, and these same selective pressures are expected to have had a significant impact on underlying genomic diversity. Population genomic analyses, especially when coupled with trait-based mapping approaches, thus have the potential to provide unique insights into the evolution of crop plants and their genomes. In this study, we performed a genome-wide analysis of genetic variation in cultivated sunflower and used the resulting data to genetically dissect variation in plant architecture (i.e., branching) and flowering time. We found substantial variation in levels of linkage disequilibrium (LD) across the genome, with islands of elevated LD generally corresponding to genomic regions underlying traits that have been targeted by selection during the evolution of cultivated sunflower. A number of these same regions also exhibited strong population genetic differentiation across the sunflower gene pool, suggesting that they may harbor genes underlying adaptation following domestication. Our analyses also identified numerous genomic regions underlying variation in both plant architecture and flowering time, many of which fall in genomic regions that have not previously been shown to influence these traits using more traditional quantitative genetic approaches.
