Homeostasis is an inherent property of biological systems, which have a general tendency to adapt, i.e., to recover their original state following environmental changes. In cells, this adaptation is mediated by changes in protein expression. Initially, cells respond to environmental changes by altered gene/protein expression; subsequently, the expression of most genes returns to basal levels, albeit not completely, as shown by recent experimental analyses of yeast. Although simple mechanisms for adaptation through network motifs, composed of just a few genes, are well understood, how regulatory networks involving many genes that activate or repress each other can generate adaptive behaviors is unclear. Here, by numerically evolving gene regulatory networks, we obtained a class of genes whose expression dynamics showed adaptation over almost all genes, from which we revealed the general logic underlying such adaptive dynamics with many degrees of freedom, which was not reducible to motifs with a few genes. This adaptation was cooperative, i.e., adaptation of one gene mutually relied upon others' adaptive expressions. Moreover, this collective behavior was robust to noise and mutations. The present study sheds a light on the nature of collective gene expression dynamics allowing for biological homeostasis.
