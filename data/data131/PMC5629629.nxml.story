To investigate the ability of SAHA-induced TRAIL DR5-CTSB crosstalk to initiate the breast cancer autophagy, RTCA assay was performed to assess the effect of SAHA on breast cancer cells, and western blot and ELISA were used to verify the inductive effects on expression of CTSB. Breast cancer cells were transfected with TRAIL DR5 siRNA to block the function of TRAIL DR5. Cell viability and apoptosis of breast cancer cells were analyzed using a muse cell analyzer. The distribution of LC3-II in TRAIL DR5-silenced breast cancer cells treated with SAHA was observed by immunofluorescence microscopy, the mRNA levels of autophagy-related genes were detected by RNA microarray, and the activity of autophagy-related signaling pathways was screened by MAPK antibody array. Results indicated that SAHA did indeed repress the growth of breast cancer cell lines with inducing CTSB expression. Western blot and ELISA results indicated that TRAIL DR5 was involved in the expression of CTSB in SAHA-induced breast cancer cells. Cell viability and apoptosis assays showed that the inactivation of TRAIL DR5 can significantly inhibit the effects of SAHA. An immunofluorescence assay indicated that, with SAHA treatment, MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7 cells underwent apparent morphological changes. While SAHA was added in the TRAIL-DR5 blocked cells, the distribution of LC3-II signal was dispersed, the intensity of fluorescence signal was weaker than that of SAHA alone. RNA array indicated that SAHA significantly increased mRNA expression of autophagy marker LC3A/B whereas the change was significantly reversed in TRAIL DR5-silenced cells. The results of MAPK antibody array showed that SAHA and TRAIL DR5 could affect the activity of AKT1, AKT2, and TOR protein in breast cancer cells. These results provide more evidence that SAHA may stimulate TRAIL DR5-CTSB crosstalk, influence the activity of downstream TOR signalling pathway mainly through the AKTs pathway, and initiate the autophagy of breast cancer cells.
