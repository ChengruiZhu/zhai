Modern genetic studies, including genome-wide surveys for disease-associated loci and copy number variation, provide a list of critical genomic regions that play an important role in predisposition to disease. Using these regions to understand disease pathogenesis requires the ability to first distinguish causal genes from other nearby genes spuriously contained within these regions. To do this we must identify the key pathways suggested by those causal genes. In this manuscript we describe a statistical approach, Gene Relationships Across Implicated Loci (GRAIL), to achieve this task. It starts with genomic regions and identifies related subsets of genes involved in similar biological processesâ€”these genes highlight the likely causal genes and the key pathways. GRAIL uses abstracts from the entirety of the published scientific literature about the genes to look for potential relationships between genes. We apply GRAIL to four very different phenotypes. In each case we identify a subset of highly related genes; in cases where false positive regions are present, GRAIL is able to separate out likely true positives. GRAIL therefore offers the potential to translate disease genomic regions from unbiased genomic surveys into the key processes that may be critical to the disease.
