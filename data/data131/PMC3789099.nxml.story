7B2, a protein initially isolated from the porcine pituitary gland, has been identified in numerous animal and human tissues, with the highest concentrations in the pituitary and hypothalamus. The 7B2 molecule is highly evolutionarily conserved and is considered to be indispensable in the function and regulation of proprotein convertase 2 (PC2). In the present study, the plasma 7B2 immunoreactivity (7B2-IR) of 18 patients with liver disease was studied. Of these patients, seven (three male and four female), aged 37–67 [54.6±13.5 (SD)] years, suffered from liver cirrhosis of cryptogenic (n=2) or alcoholic (n=5) aetiology. The remaining 11 patients (four male and seven female), aged 22–76 [56.1±17.6 (SD)] years, suffered from miscellaneous liver abnormalities. The clinical diagnosis was confirmed in the majority of patients by the histological examination of a percutaneous liver biopsy or by appropriate radiological investigations. Plasma bilirubin, alkaline phosphatase, aspartate aminotransferase, albumin, prothrombin time, electrolytes, urea and creatinine were measured. The plasma 7B2-IR levels were estimated using a sensitive radioimmunoassay (RIA), and the elution position of 7B2-IR was verified by gel chromatography. The mean plasma 7B2-IR concentration in patients with liver disease was 99.44±15.9 pmol/l. In the patients with hepatocellular damage due to metastatic tumours [Ca bronchus, carcinoid (n=6)], the 7B2-IR concentrations were significantly higher [185±36.9 pmol/l, (P<0.05)] compared with the overall subjects with liver damage. The results of the present study demonstrate that 7B2-IR is increased in liver disease, with the highest levels detected in patients with tumourous liver conditions.
