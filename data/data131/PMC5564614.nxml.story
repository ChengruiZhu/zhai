Activation of Wnt/β-catenin signaling is essential for colorectal carcinogenesis. Tankyrase, a member of the poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) family, is a positive regulator of the Wnt/β-catenin signaling. Accordingly, tankyrase inhibitors are under preclinical development for colorectal cancer (CRC) therapy. However, Wnt-driven colorectal cancer cells are not equally sensitive to tankyrase inhibitors, and cellular factors that affect tankyrase inhibitor sensitivity remain elusive. Here, we established a tankyrase inhibitor-resistant cell line, 320-IWR, from Wnt/β-catenin-dependent CRC COLO-320DM cells. 320-IWR cells exhibited resistance to tankyrase inhibitors, IWR-1 and G007-LK, but remained sensitive to a PARP-1/2 inhibitor, olaparib, and several anti-CRC agents. In 320-IWR cells, nuclear localization of active β-catenin was decreased and expression of β-catenin target genes was constitutively repressed, suggesting that these cells repressed the Wnt/β-catenin signaling and were dependent on alternative proliferation pathways. 320-IWR cells exhibited upregulated mTOR signaling and were more sensitive to mTOR inhibition than the parental cells. Importantly, mTOR inhibition reversed resistance to tankyrase inhibitors and potentiated their anti-proliferative effects in 320-IWR cells as well as in CRC cell lines in which the mTOR pathway was intrinsically activated. These results indicate that mTOR signaling confers resistance to tankyrase inhibitors in CRC cells and suggest that the combination of tankyrase and mTOR inhibitors would be a useful therapeutic approach for a subset of CRCs.
