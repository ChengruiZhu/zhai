The induction of high-rate protein secretion entails increased biogenesis of secretory apparatus organelles. We examined the biogenesis of the secretory apparatus in the B cell line CH12 because it can be induced in vitro to secrete immunoglobulin (Ig). Upon stimulation with lipopolysaccharide (LPS), CH12 cells increased secretion of IgM 12-fold. This induced secretion was accompanied by preferential expansion of the ER and the Golgi complex. Three parameters of the rough ER changed: its area and volume increased 3.3- and 3.7-fold, respectively, and the density of membrane-bound ribosomes increased 3.5-fold. Similarly, the area of the Golgi stack increased 3.3-fold, and its volume increased 4.1-fold. These changes provide sufficient biosynthetic capacity to account for the increased secretory activity of CH12. Despite the large increase in IgM synthesis, and because of the expansion of the ER, the concentration of IgM within the ER changed less than twofold during the differentiation process. During the amplification of the rough ER, the expression of resident proteins changed according to one of two patterns. The majority (75%) of rough microsomal (RM) proteins increased in proportion to the increase in rough ER size. Included in this group were both lumenal proteins such as Ig binding protein (BiP), and membrane proteins such as ribophorins I and II. In addition, the expression of a minority (approximately 9%) of RM polypeptides increased preferentially, such that their abundance within the RM of secreting CH12 cells was increased. Thus, the expansion of ER during CH12 differentiation involves preferential increases in the abundance of a few resident proteins, superimposed upon proportional increases in most ER proteins.
