A study was conducted to synthesise and evaluate the anti-inflammatory and anti-microbial activities of mannich bases from 1, 2 – hydroxy pyrazolines. For this, vanillin was reacted with substituted acetophenones and different vanillinyl chalcones were obtained which when coupled with phenyl hydrazine, produced hudroxy 1, 2 – pyrazolines. The hydroxyl pyrazolines were reacted with sulpha drugs and other compounds of biological interest containing free amino group in the presence of formaldehyde when mannich bases of 1, 2- hydroxyl pyrazolines were obtained. The compounds were characterized by elemental analysis, Ultra Violet (UV), Infra Red (IR) and Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) studies. All the newly synthesized compounds have been screened for Anti-inflammatory and Anti-microbial activity. Out of six compounds, para nitro hydroxy pyrazolines of sulphadiazine mannich base (A), nitrohydroxy pyrazoline of sulphacetamide (B) substituted nitro hydroxyl pyrazoline of amino anti-pyrine mannich (F) exhibited significant or oedema in habiting oedem activity. Out of six compounds, para nitro hydroxyl pyrazoline of sulphadiazine mannich base (A) also exhibited anti-microbial activity.
