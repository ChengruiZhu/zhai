Analysis by qRT-PCR revealed that miR-338-3p was downregulated in the tissue samples of 20 OS patients when compared with that in their matched adjacent non-tumor tissues. Furthermore, miR-338-3p was significantly downregulated in three common OS cell lines, namely, MG-63, Saos2, and HOS, when compared with that in the human osteoblast cell line hFOB1.19. Analysis by luciferase reporter assay, qRT-PCR, and western blotting revealed that activator of 90 kDa heat shock protein ATPase homolog 1 (AHSA1) is a direct target of miR-338-3p. miR-338-3p overexpression led to significant reduction in AHSA1 protein levels in MG63 and Saos2 cells. miR-338-3p overexpression reduced cell viability and migration and invasion behavior of MG63 and Saos2 cells. In addition, miR-338-3p overexpression suppressed epithelial–mesenchymal transition (EMT), induced a significant G1-phase arrest and did not affect the apoptosis in both MG-63 and Saos2 cells. Moreover, overexpression of AHSA1 reversed the inhibitory effect of miR-338-3p overexpression on proliferation, cell cycle, apoptosis, EMT, migration, and invasion of MG63 and Saos2 cells, thereby suggesting that miR-338-3p acts as a tumor suppressor in OS cells by targeting AHSA1.
