Serial analysis of gene expression (SAGE) analysis is used to profile the RNA transcripts present in a cell or tissue sample. In SAGE experiments, short portions of transcripts are sequenced in proportion to their abundance. These sequence tags must be mapped back to sequence databases to determine from which gene they were derived. Although the present genome annotation efforts have greatly facilitated this mapping process, a significant fraction of tags remain unassigned. The authors describe a computational algorithm, SAGE2Splice, that effectively and efficiently maps a subset of these unmapped tags to candidate splice junctions (the edges of two exons). In two test cases, 7%–8% of analyzed tags matched potential splice junctions. Based on the availability of RNA, sufficient information to design polymerase chain reaction (PCR) primers, and the confidence score associated with the predictions, 12 candidate splice junctions were selected for experimental tests. Nine of the tested predictions were validated by PCR and sequencing, confirming the capacity of the SAGE2Splice method to reveal previously unknown exons. Using recommended high specificity parameters, 5%–6% of high-quality unmapped SAGE tags were found to map to candidate splice junctions. An Internet interface to the SAGE2Splice system is described at
