) and five risk factors [pre-diabetes/diabetes (HbA1c≥5.7%) inflammation (hsCRP ≥3 mg/L), pre-hypertension/hypertension (SBP/DBP≥130/85 mmHg), high triglycerides (≥150 mg/dL), low high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (<40 (men)/<50 mg/dL (women)]. Sex-stratified, logistic and multinomial logistic regression models estimated concurrent obesity and cardiometabolic risk, with and without abdominal obesity, adjusting for age, smoking, alcohol consumption, physical activity, urbanicity, and income. Irrespective of urbanicity, 78.3% of the sample had ≥1 elevated cardiometabolic risk factor (normal weight: 33.2% had ≥1 elevated risk factor; overweight: 5.7% had none). At age 18–30, 47.4% had no elevated risk factors, which dropped to 6% by age 70, largely due to age-related increase in hypertension risk (18–30 years: 11%, >70 years: 73%). Abdominal obesity was highly predictive of metabolic risk, irrespective of overweight (e.g., “metabolically at risk overweight” relative to “metabolically healthy normal weight” [men: Relative Risk Ratio (RRR) =39.06; 95% Confidence Interval (CI): 23.47, 65.00; women: RRR=22.26; 95% CI: 17.49, 28.33]). To conclude, a large proportion of Chinese adults have metabolic abnormalities. High hypertension risk with age, irrespective of obesity underlies the low prevalence of metabolically healthy overweight. Screening for cardiometabolic-related outcomes dependent upon overweight will likely miss a large portion of the Chinese at-risk population.
