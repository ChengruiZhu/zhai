With ACUC approval, BMAC and leukoreduced PRP were processed from BMA (proximal humerus) and whole blood (jugular vein), respectively, of adult dogs using a commercially available system. Femoral condyles were harvested from adult dogs (n=3) immediately after euthanasia for unrelated reasons and preserved using tissue bank protocol. On day 21 of preservation, cylindrical OCAs (8 mm diam x 8 mm depth) were created (n=36; 12/dog), and randomly assigned to treatments: (1) NEG - bone portion of OCA lavaged with 10 ml saline (2) BMAC - bone portion of OCA lavaged, dried, and then saturated with 0.5 ml BMAC (3) PRP - bone portion of OCA lavaged, dried, and then saturated with 0.5 ml PRP. OCAs were cultured for 7 or 14 days (n=6/group/day), media were changed and collected on days 3, 7, and 14 for biomarker analysis. On days 7 and 14, OCAs were evaluated for viable cell colonization and infiltration using Calcein AM staining. To determine if cells were osteoprogenitors, colony forming unit (CFU) analysis was performed using crystal violet staining to determine CFUs/ml for each BMAC and PRP sample. OCA culture media were assessed for alkaline phosphatase (ALP), dickkopf-related protein (DKK), osteoprotegerin (OPG), osteopontin (OPN), adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), bone morphogenic protein-2 (BMP-2), and bone morphogenic protein-7 (BMP-7) using commercially available assays. Data were compared for statistically significance (pâ‰¤0.05) differences.
