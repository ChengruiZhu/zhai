Cerulein-induced pancreatitis is similar to human edematous pancreatitis, characterized by the dysregulation of digestive enzyme production, edema formation, and an infiltration of inflammatory cells into the pancreas. We previously showed that the Janus kinase 2 (JAK2)/STAT3 pathway mediates inflammatory signaling in cerulein-stimulated pancreatic acinar cells. PPAR-γ has been implicated in the regulation of inflammatory responses in several cells. In the present study, we investigated the role of PPAR-γ in cerulein-induced activation of JAK2/STAT3 in pancreatic acinar cells. Treatment with cerulein induced the activation of JAK2/STAT3 and PPAR-γ expression in AR42J cells. Cerulein-induced PPAR-γ expression was inhibited by AG490, a JAK2/STAT3 inhibitor, in AR42J cells. An immunoprecipitation analysis showed that PPAR-γ binds to STAT3 in cerulein-stimulated AR42J cells. Down-regulation of PPAR-γ by siRNA increased STAT3 phosphorylation in AR42J cells stimulated with cerulein. These results show that PPAR-γ inactivates STAT3 by directly interacting with STAT3 in cerulein-stimulated pancreatic acinar cells. Overexpression of PPAR-γ may be beneficial for preventing pancreatitis by suppressing the activation of STAT3 in pancreatic acinar cells.
