Specialized enzymes add and remove chemical modifications to the histone proteins that package DNA into nucleosomes. These modifications act as labels to recruit various proteins to the DNA locations where they are needed to control DNA functions, such as gene expression. The modifications are usually made and maintained in response to specific signals. However, if a modifying enzyme is itself recruited by the modification it makes, then this positive feedback could cause the modification or its absence to be self-sustaining, and even heritable, once the signal has gone. We used computer simulations to systematically explore the possibilities for such epigenetic states when there is an expanded modification ‘code’ - one that involves the presence or absence of two different modifications rather than just one. We found that this small expansion of the histone code allows hundreds of different modification and enzyme recruitment schemes to give alternative stable and heritable states. These worked best when the nucleosomes in alternative states were differently modified at both positions. All working schemes involved positive feedback and cooperativity between nucleosomes. Thus, even a simple histone code could be used in many ways to make stable and heritable, yet reversible, marks on DNA.
