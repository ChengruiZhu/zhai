 1. Brightness discrimination has been studied with individuals breathing oxygen concentrations corresponding to 7 altitudes between sea level and 17,000 feet. The brightnesses were 0.1, 0.01, and 0.001 millilambert involving only daylight (cone) vision. 2. At these light intensities, brightness discrimination begins to deteriorate at fairly low altitudes. The deterioration is obvious at 8,000 feet, and becomes marked at 15,000 feet, where at low brightness, the contrast must be increased 100 per cent over the sea level value before it can be recognized. 3. The impairment of brightness discrimination with increase in altitude is greater at higher altitudes than at lower. The impairment starts slowly and becomes increasingly rapid the higher the altitude. 4. Impairment of brightness discrimination varies inversely with the light intensity. It is most evident under the lowest light intensities studied, but shows in all of them. However, it decreases in such a way that the deterioration is negligible in full daylight and sunlight. 5. The thresholds of night (rod) vision and day (cone) vision are equally affected by anoxia. 6. The quantitative form of the relation between brightness discrimination Î”
