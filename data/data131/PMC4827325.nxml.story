Nanoparticles (NPs) have been used as novel drug delivery systems. Drug-incorporated NPs for local delivery might optimize the efficacy and minimize the side effects of drugs. Intravenous prostacyclin improves long-term survival in patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH), but it causes serious side effects such as catheter-related infections. We investigated the efficacy and safety of intratracheal administration of a prostacyclin analogue, beraprost (BPS), incorporated NPs in Sugen-hypoxia-normoxia and monocrotaline rat models of PAH and in human PAH pulmonary arterial smooth muscle cells (PASMCs). After a single administration, BPS NPs significantly decreased right ventricular pressure, right ventricular hypertrophy, and pulmonary artery muscularization in the 2 rat models. BPS NPs significantly improved the survival rate in the monocrotaline rat model. No infiltration of inflammatory cells, hemorrhage, or fibrosis was found in the liver, kidney, spleen, and heart after the administration of BPS NPs. No liver or kidney dysfunction was found in the blood examinations. BPS and BPS NPs significantly inhibited the proliferation of human PAH PASMCs after 24 hours of treatment. BPS NPs significantly continued to inhibit the proliferation of human PAH PASMCs at 24 hours after the removal of BPS NPs. BPS NPs significantly induced apoptosis in PAH PASMCs compared to that in non-PAH PASMCs. Intratracheal administration of BPS NPs ameliorates pulmonary hypertension in PAH rat models by a sustained antiproliferative effect and a proapoptotic effect on PAH PASMCs.
