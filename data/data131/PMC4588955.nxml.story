Two hundred fifty-one (19%) reported at least one SRC within the last 6 years while 171 (13%) reported SRC within the previous 12 months. The helmets worn by the players were manufactured by Riddell (52%), Schutt (35%) and Xenith (13%) and were purchased in 2011-2012 (39%), 2009-2010 (33%), 2002-2008 (28%). Mouth guards worn by players included generic models provided by the school (61%) and specialized mouth guards (39%) custom fitted by a dental professional or specifically marketed to reduce the risk of SRC. A total of 115 (8.6%) players sustained 116 SRCs. There was no difference in the rate of SRC {%, 95% CI} by the type of helmet worn [p = 0.454], (Riddell {9.5, 7.4 -12.0}, Schutt {8.1, 5.9 -11.1} and Xenith {6.7, 3.7 -11.8}), as well as the year the helmet was purchased [p = 0.745], (2011-2012 {9.3, 7.0 -12.3}, 2009-2010 {7.9, 5.7 -11.0} and 2002-2008 {8.8, 6.2 -12.3}. The severity (days lost) of SRC was not different (p = 0.883) for players wearing Riddell (13.5: 8.8, 19.0), Schutt (13.0: 10, 21.5) and Xenith (13.5: 10.8, 21.3) helmets. The SRC rate for players who wore a specialized or custom-fitted mouth guard (12.5, 9.8 - 15.8) was higher [RR = 1.9, 1.36 - 2.70], than for players who wore a generic mouth guard provided by their school (6.4, 4.8, 8.3), [p <0.001].
