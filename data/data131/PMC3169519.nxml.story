Treatment timing within the 24-h timescale, that is, circadian (circa, about; dies, day) timing, can change by several fold the tolerability and antitumor efficacy of anticancer agents both in experimental models and in cancer patients. Chronotherapeutics aims at improving the tolerability and/or the efficacy of medications through the administration of treatments according to biological rhythms. Recent findings highlight the need of individualizing circadian delivery schedules according to the patient genetic background. In order to address this issue, we propose a combined experimental and mathematical approach in which molecular mathematical models are fitted to experimental measurements of critical biological variables in the studied experimental model or patient. Optimization procedures are then applied to the calibrated mathematical model for the design of theoretically optimal circadian delivery patterns. As a first proof of concept we focused on the anticancer drug irinotecan. A mathematical model of the drug molecular PK-PD was built and fitted to experimental data in Caco-2 colon cancer cells. Numerical algorithms were then applied to theoretically optimize the chronomodulated exposure of Caco-2 cells to irinotecan.
