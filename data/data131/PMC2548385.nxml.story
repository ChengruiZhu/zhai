Critical to the effective implementation of high throughput methods of synthesis is the necessity for a significant supporting level of automation. There are a number of critical issues associated with the successful introduction, and supporting role, of automation of small molecule chemical synthesis. Clearly there are needs for automation to increase drug candidate synthesis throughput. Automation of repetitive and laborious tasks associated with the synthesis process can release skilled chemists to apply their talents to the more challenging investigational aspects of developing new synthetic protocols. This provides continuity in the compound supply pipeline and ensures an optimal use of the automated platform for compound production. The very high fidelity of performing repetitive processes that can be managed through automation also removes some of the limitations and errors associated with more fallible human operators. This can include very difficult tasks associated with tracking data, and general information and inventory management. Taken collectively, these attributes associated with automation can lead to greater efficiencies, throughputs and improved allocation of human resources with concomitant reductions in costs associated with current day and future drug discovery. In our library development/synthesis paradigm, we feel that automation support must be invoked early in the process and that this automation support must continue throughout the project.
