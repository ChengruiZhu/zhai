Yin Yang 2 (YY2) is a multifunctional zinc-finger transcription factor that belongs to YY family. Unlike the well-characterized YY1, our understanding regarding the biological functions of YY2 is still very limited. Here we found for the first time that in contrast to YY1, which had been reported to be oncogenic, the expression level of YY2 in tumor cells and/or tissues was downregulated compared with its expression level in the normal ones. We also demonstrated that YY2 exerts biological function contrary to YY1 in cell proliferation. We elucidated that YY2 positively enhances p21 expression, and concomitantly, its silencing promotes cells to enter G2/M phase and enhances cell proliferation. Furthermore, we found that YY2 regulation on p21 occurs p53-dependently. Finally, we identified a novel YY2 binding site in the promoter region of tumor suppressor p53. We found that YY2 binds to the p53 promoter and activates its transcriptional activity, and subsequently, regulates cell cycle progression via p53/p21 axis. Taken together, our study not only identifies YY2 as a novel tumor suppressor gene that plays a pivotal role in cell cycle regulation, but also provides new insights regarding the regulatory mechanism of the conventional p53/p21 axis.
