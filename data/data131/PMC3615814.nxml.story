The purpose of this intervention study was to measure the impact of an onsite and online 12-week worksite heart-health campaign designed to reduce metabolic risk factors for employees at BMW of North America, LLC. All participants received three coaching sessions by a registered dietitian (RD), participated in eight educational sessions led by an RD, viewed their pre, midpoint and final biometric data online, and had access to other web-based tools and educational booklets. The program used team-based competition. At baseline and week 12, blood pressure, anthropometric and hematologic parameters were measured, including changes in weight, blood pressure, fasting blood glucose, waist circumference, total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, triglycerides, and smoking habits. Of the 100 individuals that enrolled, 95 completed the program, and 87 met criteria to be eligible for data analysis. Paired t tests demonstrated significant reductions in weight (p<.0001), body mass index (p=.0047), waist circumference (p <.0001), diastolic blood pressure (p=.0018), and systolic blood pressure (p=.0012). Paired t tests for total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, triglycerides, and fasting blood glucose did not indicate any significant improvements. There was an improvement in body mass index and blood pressure classifications after completion of the program. A Friedman’s test of blood pressure classification demonstrated significant improvements in participants’ blood pressure classification from pre-program to midpoint, midpoint to end, and pre-program to end. These results support the effectiveness of a dietitian-led, team-based, worksite heart-health campaign with web-based education to reduce risk factors for metabolic syndrome.
