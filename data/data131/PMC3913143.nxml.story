Menorrhagia is the most common symptom that is experienced by women with bleeding disorders. Von Willebrand disease (VWD) is the most common congenital human bleeding disorder that is manifested as a quantitative deficiency in Von Willebrand factor (VWF) or dysfunction of this factor. The frequency of VWD is similar in both men and women. However, VWD is more readily detected in women due to the presence of severe bleeding associated with menstrual cycles and childbirth. The present study was carried out to find the frequency of VWD, its types, and clinical features of the disease among women with menorrhagia who referred to the Hematology Clinic of the Kermanshah University of Medical Sciences. The study comprised 482 women with menorrhagia. After excluding patients with confounding factors, 56 (11.6%) patients were evaluated for inherited bleeding disorders. We detected 31 (55.3%) patients with VWD. Type 3 of VWD was the most frequent subtype (45.2%) followed in frequency by type 2 (32.3%), and type 1 (22.5%). In conclusion, our study indicated that menorrhagia can be the first symptom of VWD. Therefore, rare coagulation disorders should be considered in women with idiopathic menorrhagia, particularly in regions with high rates of consanguinity.
