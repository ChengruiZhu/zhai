Autophagy is an intracellular recycling and degradation process for regulating tumor progression, survival and drug resistance. Nickel compounds have been identified as human carcinogens. However, the role of nickel-induced autophagy in lung carcinogenesis has not yet been fully elucidated. In this study, we determined that hexokinase 2 (HK2), which phosphorylates glucose and regulates autophagy, is the key mediator in nickel-induced autophagy in lung bronchial epithelial cells. We attempted to investigate the effects of the antidiabetic drug metformin on HK2 expression and lung cancer chemoprevention. Our results showed that metformin decreases nickel-induced autophagy and activation of apoptosis through inhibition of HK2 gene, protein and activity. Furthermore, we demonstrated that lipocalin 2 (LCN2), which is released by neutrophils at sites of infection and inflammation is involved in HK2-driven autophagy pathway. Knockdown of endogenous HK2 and LCN2 by shRNA reduced nickel-elicited autophagy and apoptosis, illustrating that metabolic alteration and inflammatory action are important in nickel-elicited carcinogenesis. We also determined the association between nickel-induced autophagy and apoptosis. Inhibition of nickel-induced autophagy abolished apoptotic cell death in chloroquine-treated, shLC3 Beas-2B cells and Atg5
