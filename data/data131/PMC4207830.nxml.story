Dynamic nature of the protein-protein interactions is an important element of cellular processes such as metabolic reactions and signal transduction, but its atomistic details are still unclear. Computational survey using molecular dynamics simulation is a straightforward method to elucidate these atomistic protein-protein interaction processes. However, a sufficient configurational sampling of the large system containing the atomistic protein complex model and explicit solvent remains a great challenge due to the long timescale involved. Here, we demonstrate that the multiscale enhanced sampling (MSES) successfully captured the atomistic details of the association/dissociation processes of a barnase-barstar complex covering the sampled space from the native complex structure to fully non-native configurations. The landscape derived from the simulation indicates that the association process is funnel-like downhill, analogously to the funnel landscape of fast-folding proteins. The funnel was found to be originated from near-native orientations guided by the shape complementarity between barnase and barstar, accelerating the formation of native inter-molecular interactions to complete the final complex structure.
