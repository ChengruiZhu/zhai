Transcription initiation is an important process that contributes to determining mRNA and eventually protein levels. In multicellular organisms transcription activity of a single gene is regulated by many different signals. This leads to multiple transcription factors binding to the same promoter. Here we study fundamental aspects of this regulation. We show that the formation of a single regulating protein complex, consisting of tens of proteins is a very inefficient mechanism: it is slow and hard to regulate. The formation of small complexes, each leaving a histone modification on the promoter solves these problems. Optimally complexes are assembled in a strict order and new histone modifications sensitize the chromatin for the formation of the next complex. This leads to a cyclic, ordered series of irreversible events that is fast and can be tightly regulated—a cyclic ratchet mechanism; like a mechanical ‘clock’. In the ratchet model, one particular chromatin state allows for RNA polymerase rebinding, which makes bursts in mRNA production a basic feature of the ratchet mechanism. Such bursting transcriptional activity has indeed been observed for eukaryotic genes. The duration of the entire transcription cycle can easily become tens of minutes, even though single proteins reside on the chromatin for only tens of seconds. Although the formation time of protein complexes on chromatin can be highly variable, due to invariable stochasticity in protein binding and disassociation, the duration of the entire transcription cycle can be very precise. As a consequence, cells that are activated at the same moment in time display synchronous transcriptional activity for several transcription cycles. This provides an explanation for transient transcription cycles observed at the level of cell populations.
