Precise radiation therapy (RT) for abdominal lesions is complicated by respiratory motion and suboptimal soft tissue contrast in 4D CT. 4D MRI offers improved contrast although long scan times and irregular breathing patterns can be limiting. To address this, visual biofeedback (VBF) was introduced into 4D MRI. Ten volunteers were consented to an IRB‐approved protocol. Prospective respiratory‐triggered, T2‐weighted, coronal 4D MRIs were acquired on an open 1.0T MR‐SIM. VBF was integrated using an MR‐compatible interactive breath‐hold control system. Subjects visually monitored their breathing patterns to stay within predetermined tolerances. 4D MRIs were acquired with and without VBF for 2‐ and 8‐phase acquisitions. Normalized respiratory waveforms were evaluated for scan time, duty cycle (programmed/acquisition time), breathing period, and breathing regularity (end‐inhale coefficient of variation, EI‐COV). Three reviewers performed image quality assessment to compare artifacts with and without VBF. Respiration‐induced liver motion was calculated via centroid difference analysis of end‐exhale (EE) and EI liver contours. Incorporating VBF reduced 2‐phase acquisition time (
