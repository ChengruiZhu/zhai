Solitary plasmacytoma of the skull is rare and few cases have been reported in the English literature. Plasmacytoma of the skull has a wide spectrum of pathology, including a quite benign, solitary plasmacytoma (SPC), and an extremely malignant, multiple myeloma (MM) at the two ends of the spectrum. The prognosis for solitary plasmacytoma of the skull appears to be good when it can be diagnosed on strict criteria. The clinical features of solitary plasmacytoma of the skull are complex and not easily identified, resulting in a high misdiagnosis rate. A comprehensive examination and analysis which includes radiological examination, immunoglobulin, biochemistry, test for Bence Jones protein in the urine and bone marrow is needed for correct diagnosis. If the skull lesion is isolated, with accompanying marked swelling in the area and tenderness, plasmacytoma must be considered as a possibility for the cause of solitary skull masses. Two cases of solitary plasmacytoma of the skull lesions were retrospectively reviewed, in which a comprehensive examination was used in order to predict the clinical course of solitary plasmacytoma of the skull. The patients received postoperative radiation and/or chemotherapy. Survival following surgery was longer than 2 years for patient 1, and patient 2 is alive at the 18-month follow-up.
