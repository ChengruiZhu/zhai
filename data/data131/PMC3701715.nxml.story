In all eukaryotic cells chromosome partition during mitosis requires a number of processes, including the formation of the mitotic spindle, i.e. the machinery that drives chromosome segregation to the daughter cells. Mitotic entry requires a delicate balance between protein phosphorylation, driven by cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs), and protein dephosphorylation, carried out by specific phosphatases that counteract CDK activity. A critical threshold in CDK activity is indeed required for mitotic entry. In the past few years the Greatwall kinase has also been implicated in mitotic entry through phosphorylation of proteins of the endosulfine family, which in turn inhibit the activity of the PP2A phosphatase that would otherwise dephosphorylate CDK targets. Whether Greatwall and endosulfines have a mitotic function in budding yeast, where PP2A promotes, rather than inhibits, mitotic entry has not been established. Here we show that the Greatwall-endosulfine-PP2A regulatory module is conserved also in budding yeast and that endosulfines from different species are interchangeable for their mitotic function. However, in budding yeast cells endosulfines contribute to full activation and proper localization of PP2A, suggesting that they act as both inhibitors and activators of PP2A. Our data emphasize how the same regulatory module is adapted to meet specific mitotic features in different organisms.
