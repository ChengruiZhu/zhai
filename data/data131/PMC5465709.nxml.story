Differential patterns of white matter disruption have recently been reported in the non-fluent (nfvPPA) and semantic (svPPA) variants of primary progressive aphasia (PPA). No single measure is sufficient to distinguish between the PPA variants, but connected speech allows for the quantification of multiple measures. The aim of the present study was to further investigate the white matter correlates associated with connected speech features in PPA. We examined the relationship between white matter metrics and connected speech deficits using an automated analysis of transcriptions of connected speech and diffusion tensor imaging in language-related tracts. Syntactic, lexical, and semantic features were automatically extracted from transcriptions of topic-directed interviews conducted with groups of individuals with nfvPPA or svPPA as well as with a group of healthy controls. A principal component analysis was performed in order to reduce the number of language measures and yielded a five-factor solution. The results indicated that nfvPPA patients differed from healthy controls on a syntactic factor, and svPPA patients differed from controls on two semantic factors. However, the patient groups did not differ on any factor. Moreover, a correlational analysis revealed that the lexical richness factor was significantly correlated with radial diffusivity in the left inferior longitudinal fasciculus, which suggests that semantic deficits in connected speech reflect a disruption of this ventral pathway, and which is largely consistent with the results of previous studies. Using an automated approach for the analysis of connected speech combined with probabilistic tractography, the present findings demonstrate that nfvPPA patients are impaired relative to healthy controls on syntactic measures and have increased radial diffusivity in the left superior longitudinal fasciculus, whereas the svPPA group was impaired on lexico-semantic measures relative to controls and showed increased radial diffusivity in the uncinate and inferior longitudinal fasciculus bilaterally.
