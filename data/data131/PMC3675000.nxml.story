 is unique in being the most ethanol tolerant organism known. This property lies at the basis of its ecological competitiveness in sugar-rich ecological niches and its use for the production of alcoholic beverages and bioethanol, both of which involve accumulation of high levels of ethanol. Up to now, all research on yeast ethanol tolerance has focused on tolerance of cell proliferation to high ethanol levels. However, the most ecologically and industrially relevant aspect is the capacity of fermenting yeast cells to accumulate high ethanol levels in the absence of cell proliferation. Using QTL mapping by pooled-segregant whole-genome sequence analysis, we show that maximal ethanol accumulation capacity and tolerance of cell proliferation to high ethanol levels have a partially different genetic basis. We identified three specific genes responsible for high ethanol accumulation capacity, of which one gene encodes a protein kinase involved in DNA damage repair. Our work provides the first insight in the genetic basis of maximal ethanol accumulation capacity, shows that it involves different genetic elements compared to tolerance of cell proliferation to high ethanol levels, and reveals for the first time the importance of DNA damage repair in ethanol tolerance.
