Soft neural electrode arrays that are mechanically matched between neural tissues and electrodes offer valuable opportunities for the development of disease diagnose and brain computer interface systems. Here, a thermal release transfer printing method for fabrication of stretchable bioelectronics, such as soft neural electrode arrays, is presented. Due to the large, switchable and irreversible change in adhesion strength of thermal release tape, a low‐cost, easy‐to‐operate, and temperature‐controlled transfer printing process can be achieved. The mechanism of this method is analyzed by experiments and fracture‐mechanics models. Using the thermal release transfer printing method, a stretchable neural electrode array is fabricated by a sacrificial‐layer‐free process. The ability of the as‐fabricated electrode array to conform different curvilinear surfaces is confirmed by experimental and theoretical studies. High‐quality electrocorticography signals of anesthetized rat are collected with the as‐fabricated electrode array, which proves good conformal interface between the electrodes and dura mater. The application of the as‐fabricated electrode array on detecting the steady‐state visual evoked potentials research is also demonstrated by
