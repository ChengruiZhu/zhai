Rhythms in the brain are believed to play an important role in cognition. Disruptions in these oscillations are associated with a number of neurological and psychiatric disorders. Therefore, noninvasive brain stimulation techniques that target these oscillations offer promise as therapeutic tools. In particular, transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS) applies a periodic stimulation waveform to engage specific oscillations in the cortex. Although recent studies provide evidence for the modulation of cortical oscillations by tACS, the exact mechanism by which the effects are produced is poorly understood. We propose two mathematical models of interaction between periodic electrical stimulation and ongoing brain activity that may explain the effects of tACS. In addition, we present a unique dataset in which we stimulated the patientsâ€™ cortical surface with subdural electrodes and observed the responses to stimulation in neighboring electrodes. We found that stimulation enhanced ongoing oscillations both during and immediately after stimulation. This enhancement depended on the brain state, thereby supporting our proposed models. Our results demonstrate the effect of electrical stimulation on cortical oscillations and highlight the importance of considering the state of the brain when designing electrical stimulation therapies for disorders of the central nervous system.
