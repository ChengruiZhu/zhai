Natalizumab is a widely accepted drug for the relapsing–remitting subtype of multiple sclerosis (RRMS). The present longitudinal exploratory study in RRMS patients analyzes the effects of natalizumab treatment on the levels of pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory cytokine protein levels and also the frequency and suppressor function of regulatory T cells. Flow cytometry was used to determine cytokines and regulatory T cell frequency while regulatory T cell suppressor function was assayed in vitro at different time-points after starting with natalizumab. Results showed serum levels of pro-inflammatory interferon gamma and interleukin (IL)-12p70, as well as anti-inflammatory IL-4 and IL-10, were elevated just a few hours or days after first IV infusion of natalizumab. Interestingly, other cytokines like IL-5 or IL-13 were also elevated while pro-inflammatory IL-17, IL-2, and IL-1β increased only after a long-term treatment, suggesting different immune mechanisms. In contrast, we did not observe any effect of natalizumab treatment on regulatory T cell frequency or activity. In conclusion, these results suggest natalizumab has other immunological effects beyond VLA-4 interaction and inhibition of CNS extravasation, the relevance of which is as yet unknown and warrants further investigation.
