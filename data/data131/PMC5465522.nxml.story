Sweet's syndrome is a neutrophilic dermatosis characterized by an abrupt onset of painful erythematous lesions showing neutrophilic infiltrates in the dermis. Fever and an elevated neutrophil level are generally observed. Sweet's syndrome may be idiopathic, malignancy-associated, or drug-induced (mainly involving granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) administration). Although systemic corticosteroids are usually effective, the symptoms of Sweet's syndrome recur in some refractory cases. Herein, we report a case of a 55-year-old Japanese woman with recurrent symptoms of fever (>39Â°C) and painful erythematous lesions on her four extremities, trunk, and neck. Laboratory findings revealed leukocytosis and high levels of C-reactive protein (CRP) and G-CSF. She was diagnosed with a recurrence of Sweet's syndrome, and was exclusively treated with granulocyte and monocyte adsorption apheresis (GMA) therapy once a week for 3 consecutive weeks. After the first session of GMA therapy, all symptoms including the erythematous lesions and fever were completely resolved, and serum G-CSF level was reduced. Leukocyte count, neutrophil count, serum amyloid A protein, and CRP levels were restored within normal ranges by 2 weeks. Thus, GMA therapy can successfully treat a patient with recurrent Sweet's syndrome, potentially related to the restoration of elevated serum G-CSF levels.
