The current study presents the case of a 68-year-old female patient who received biological intensity-modulated radiotherapy (BIMRT) and neoadjuvant chemotherapy for multiple peritoneal metastases of ovarian cancer. The International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics disease stage was IIIc. In addition, the patient presented with urination and defecation difficulties. The result of tumor marker detection showed a carcinoembryonic antigen level of 348.2ng/ml, a cancer antigen 125 level of 2,091 U/ml and a cancer antigen 19-9 level of 113 U/ml. Computed tomography (CT) indicated and ovarian cystic or solid package, enlargement of multiple abdominal and retroperitoneal lymph nodes and abdominal cavity effusion. Positron emission tomography/CT indicated multiple internal organ metastases. The center of the ovarian cystic or solid package was considered to be a malignant tumor. A large amount of ascites were detected, as well as abdominal and retroperitoneal lymph node metastasis. The patient was treated with BIMRT at a total dose of 48 Gy, administered as a single 4.0-Gy dose 12 times. In addition, 100 mg cisplatin was administered as a peritoneal perfusion, followed by two cycles of 180 mg Taxol and 100 mg cisplatin. Furthermore, the enlargement of the lymph nodes was reduced and the tumor in the region of the ovary had decreased in size by 90%. The ascites had disappeared and the abdominal pain was greatly improved. At the time of writing this manuscript, the patient was well and without relapse. Therefore, modern radiotherapy techniques, such as BIMRT, may be considered as a beneficial treatment option for ovarian cancer patients with multiple peritoneal metastases in whom surgery is not suitable.
