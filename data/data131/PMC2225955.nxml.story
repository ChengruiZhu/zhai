 With the use of a specially developed incubation chamber the rates of motility, respiration, and fructolysis were measured simultaneously on semen samples. By inhibiting the respiration with antimycin A, and/or the fructolysis with 2-deoxyglucose, the rates of each of the two ATP-producing pathways could be reduced independently. In this way the ratio of the amount of free energy produced by respiration and by fructolysis could be varied at will from 1 to 0. In uninhibited preparations approximately 75% of the free energy derives from respiration, and 25% from fructolysis. By the use of the absolute rates of respiration, fructolysis, and motility, the efficiency of the conversion of free energy into hydrodynamic work was calculated. After correction for the decay of the preparation during the experiment, this conversion efficiency was found to be 30â€“45% lower for free energy from respiration than for free energy from fructolysis. The difference in distribution of the enzymes for fructolysis and respiration over the flagellum was ruled out as the cause of the efficiency difference. The respiration could be 70% inhibited by oligomycin. It is concluded that approximately one-third of the free energy from respiration is used for maintenance of the mitochondria.
