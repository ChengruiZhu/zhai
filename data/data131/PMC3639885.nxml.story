Clinical phenotypes and disease-risk stratification are most often determined through the direct observations of clinicians in conjunction with published standards and guidelines, where the clinical expert is the final arbiter of the patientâ€™s classification. While this "human" approach is highly desirable in the context of personalized and optimal patient care, it is problematic in a healthcare research setting because the basis for the patient's classification is not transparent, and likely not reproducible from one clinical expert to another. This sits in opposition to the rigor required to execute, for example, Genome-wide association analyses and other high-throughput studies where a large number of variables are being compared to a complex disease phenotype. Most clinical classification systems and are not structured for automated classification, and similarly, clinical data is generally not represented in a form that lends itself to automated integration and interpretation. Here we apply Semantic Web technologies to the problem of automated, transparent interpretation of clinical data for use in high-throughput research environments, and explore migration-paths for existing data and legacy semantic standards.
