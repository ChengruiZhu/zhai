Alternative splicing is thought to be one means for generating the protein diversity necessary for the whole range of cellular functions. While the presence of alternatively spliced transcripts in the cell has been amply demonstrated, the same cannot be said for alternatively spliced proteins. The quest for alternative protein isoforms has focused primarily on the analysis of peptides from large-scale mass spectroscopy experiments, but evidence for alternative isoforms has been patchy and contradictory. A careful analysis of the peptide evidence is needed to fully understand the scale of alternative splicing detectable at the protein level. Here we analysed peptides from eight large-scale data sets, identifying just 282 splice events among 12,716 genes. This suggests that most genes have a single dominant isoform. Many of the alternative isoforms that we identified were only subtly different from the main splice variant, and one in five was generated by substitution of homologous exons by swapping one related exon for another. Remarkably, the alternative isoforms generated from homologous exons were highly conserved, first appearing 460 million years ago, and several appear to have tissue-specific roles in the brain and heart. Our results suggest that these particular isoforms are likely to have important cellular roles.
