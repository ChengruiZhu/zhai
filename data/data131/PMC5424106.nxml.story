Pdx1-cre) were sensitive to axitinib. The anti-proliferative effect was due to a G2/M block resulting in loss of 70â€“75% cell viability in the most sensitive PDAC cell line. However, a surviving sub-population showed a 2- to 3-fold increase in [C-14]deoxyglucose ([C-14]DG) uptake. This was sustained in axitinib-resistant cell lines, which were derived from parental PDAC. In addition to the axitinib-induced increase in [C-14]DG uptake, we observed a translocation of glucose transporter-1 (Glut-1) transporters from cytosolic pools to the cell surface membrane and a 2-fold increase in glycolysis rates measured by the extracellular acidification rate (ECAR). We demonstrated an axitinib-induced increase in phosphorylated Protein Kinase B (pAkt) and by blocking pAkt with a phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase (PI3K) inhibitor we reversed the Glut-1 translocation and restored sensitivity to axitinib treatment. Combination treatment with both axitinib and Akt inhibitor in parental pancreatic cell line resulted in a decrease in cell viability beyond that conferred by single therapy alone. Our study shows that PDAC resistance to axitinib results in increased glucose metabolism mediated by activated Akt. Combining axitinib and an Akt inhibitor may improve treatment in PDAC.
