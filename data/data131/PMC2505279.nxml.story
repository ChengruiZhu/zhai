The article reproduced here describes the triple arthrodesis [9]. Ryerson modified a technique earlier described by Hoke which advocated fusing the subtalar and talo-navicular joints [7]. According to Campbell [5] Ryerson popularized the name “triple arthrodesis.” Hoke had not mentioned fusion of the calcaneo-cuboid joint, although Gill, in a discussion following Hoke’s description states, “an additional arthrodesis os calcis and cuboid is unnecessary.” Thus, it is possible Ryerson introduced the third fusion of the triple arthrodesis, although the record is not clear on this point. Ryerson’s operation, however, was commonly used to stabilize the hindfoot in polio patients, and continues to be used less commonly today for other indications. It is likely Ryerson met Adolf Lorenz (1854–1946), the Professor of Orthopaedics at the University of Vienna at the time of his visit [8, 10]. Lorenz, in turn, had trained with Eduard Albert (1841–1900) who conceived the idea of arthrodesis for paralyzed extremities [2, 3]. As with most surgeons of the time, Ryerson wrote on a wide variety of topics related to spine surgery, infection, and congenital anomalies, although he seemed to have a particular interest in foot surgery.
