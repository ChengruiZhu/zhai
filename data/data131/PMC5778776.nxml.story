The present study investigated the case of a 46-year-old female with primary malignant perivascular epithelioid cell neoplasm (PEComa) of the femur. The patient presented with a 5-month history of right distal thigh pain following trauma. Radiographs of the right distal femur revealed a mixed lytic and sclerotic lesion with subtle areas of cortical destruction and soft tissue extension, consistent with an aggressive tumor. A core biopsy revealed an epithelioid tumor with granular cell features, but a definitive diagnosis could not be made. Due to the aggressive features on radiologic evaluation, the patient underwent a resection of the distal femur and reconstruction with a distal femoral megaprosthesis and hinged knee replacement. The post-resection pathology led to a final diagnosis of primary bone PEComa, with histologic features including epithelioid, granular cell and spindled cell morphologies and biphasic immunoreactivity for melanocytic and smooth muscle markers. The large tumor size (>5 cm), rapid mitotic rate, infiltrative growth pattern, high nuclear grade and cellularity, and the presence of necrosis rendered this a malignant PEComa. The present study discussed the case, including radiographic (radiographs, magnetic resonance imaging and positron emission tomography scans) and histologic appearance and a literature review.
