When cells divide they must segregate copies of their chromosomes to each of their daughters. A particular harmful situation arises when those copies are glued to each other (i.e., nondisjunction) at the moment of division. Previously, it has been possible to genetically favour this scenario, yet it has been difficult to limit the extent of nondisjunction to a single chromosome. We have developed and studied a yeast model where we control nondisjunction of one of its sixteen chromosomes. We show that dividing cells manage to complete nuclear and cell fission and therefore break that chromosome. We further show that new daughter cells then trigger a DNA damage response, yet only after they initiate a new round of replication. Remarkably, an uncommon repair strategy seems to be used to deal with this damage, which involves part of the homologous recombination machinery (i.e., RPA complex and Rad52) but lacks its primary sensor Mre11. Importantly though, both daughter cells arrest their cell cycle in G2 to prevent further damage from occurring. After a while, the cell that still carries an entire copy of the chromosome often survives, leading to aberrant forms of the chromosome in the progeny.
