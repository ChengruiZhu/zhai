The morning surge in blood pressure (BP) coincides with increased cardiovascular (CV) events. This strongly suggests that an altered circadian rhythm of BP plays a crucial role in the development of CV disease (CVD). A disrupted circadian rhythm of BP, such as the non-dipping type of hypertension (i.e., absence of nocturnal BP decline), is frequently observed in metabolic disorders and chronic kidney disease (CKD). The circadian timing system, controlled by the central clock in the suprachiasmatic nucleus of the hypothalamus and/or by peripheral clocks in the heart, vasculature, and kidneys, modulates the 24 h oscillation of BP. However, little information is available regarding the molecular and cellular mechanisms of an altered circadian timing system-mediated disrupted dipping pattern of BP in metabolic disorders and CKD that can lead to the development of CV events. A more thorough understanding of this pathogenesis could provide novel therapeutic strategies for the management of CVD. This short review will address our and othersâ€™ recent findings on the molecular mechanisms that may affect the dipping pattern of BP in metabolic dysfunction and kidney disease and its association with CV disorders.
