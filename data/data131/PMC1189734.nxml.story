Cells have evolved sophisticated ways to respond to DNA damage. This is critical because unrepaired damage can kill cells or cause them to become cancerous. The response to DNA damage has been studied for more than 50 years, and has been found to be extremely complex. The traditional way of understanding this complexity is to divide the process into its component parts with the goal of eventually reconstituting the entire process. In this study, the authors extend classical approaches using genomicsâ€”an approach that involves studying all genes in an organism simultaneously. The authors tested 12 distinct compounds (many used in cancer chemotherapy) that damage DNA and uncovered new genes involved in DNA repair. They then grouped the compounds to define how they attack cells. Using this approach, the study found that many similar DNA-damaging agents act in comparable ways to damage DNA, but surprisingly, similar compounds can also act on cells by very different mechanisms. Specifically grouping the findings together and verifying the significant results lends a high degree of confidence in the data. The development of such a reproducible experimental design is important for inspiring future experiments.
