Computational models help our understanding of complex biological systems, by identifying their key elements and revealing their operational principles. Close comparisons between model predictions and empirical observations ensure our confidence in a model as a building block for further applications. Most current neuronal models, however, are constructed to replicate only a small specific set of experimental data. Thus, it is usually unclear how these models can be generalized to different datasets and how they compare with each other. In this paper, seven neuronal models are examined that are designed to reproduce known physiological characteristics of auditory neurons involved in the detection of sound source location. Despite their different levels of complexity, the models generate largely similar results when their parameters are tuned with common criteria. Comparisons show that simple models are computationally more efficient and theoretically transparent, and therefore suitable for rigorous mathematical analyses and engineering applications including real-time simulations. In contrast, complex models are necessary for investigating the relationship between underlying biophysical processes and sub- and suprathreshold spiking properties, although they have a large number of unconstrained, unverified parameters. Having identified their advantages and drawbacks, these auditory neuron models may readily be used for future studies and applications.
