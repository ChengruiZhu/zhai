Treatment of dermatomyositis (DM) is often achieved with a stepwise algorithm. However, the literature lacks quality evidence to support the use of this therapeutic strategy. The result of a stepwise therapeutic strategy in the management of skin-only DM is presented to better understand the clinical outcomes and allow for future studies. A cohort of 102 patients with DM, 41 of whom had skin-only disease, were seen between July 2009 and April 2013 at a referral-based connective tissue disease clinic. The Cutaneous Dermatomyositis Disease Area and Severity Index was used to prospectively assess disease severity and the outcomes in 41 adult patients with skin-only DM were analyzed. Of the 41 patients with skin-only DM, 23 patients (56.1%) received antimalarial medications alone and 18 patients (43.9%) received second- or third-line agents. Ten patients (24.4%) remained at the first level of the treatment algorithm and received only hydroxychloroquine. Prednisone was included in the treatment regimen for 11 patients with skin-only disease (26.8%). The results show that management of cutaneous DM often requires second-line agents because antimalarial medications alone are insufficient to treat most patients with skin-only disease.
