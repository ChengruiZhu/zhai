MicroRNAs (miRNAs) play major roles in various biological processes and have been implicated in the pathogenesis and malignant progression of glioblastoma multiforme (GBM). The aim of this study was to assess the predictive values of miRNAs for overall survival (OS) of patients with GBM. MiRNA expression profiles and clinical information of 563 GBM patients were obtained from the Cancer Genome Atlas. The most significantly altered miRNAs were identified and miRNA expression profiles were performed, through principal component analysis, the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator method. The survival analysis was performed using the Cox regression models. Additionally, receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis was used to assess the performance of survival prediction. We used the bioinformatics tools to establish the miRNA signature for biological relevance assessment. A linear prognostic model of three miRNAs was developed and the patients were divided into high risk and low risk groups based this model. The area under the ROC curve (AUC) for the three miRNA signature predicting 5-year survival was 0.894 (95%CI, 0.789-1.000) in the testing set and0.841 (95%CI, 0.689-0.993) in all GBM patients. High risk patients had significantly shorter OS than patients with low risk (
