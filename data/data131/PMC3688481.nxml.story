Cellular processes in mammalian cells are tightly regulated to ensure that the cells function properly as a part of an organism. Dysregulation of some of these processes, such as apoptosis, cell proliferation and growth, can lead to cancer. One of the most important regulation mechanisms for cellular processes is via activation of membrane receptors by extra-cellular stimulus. Such cues trigger signal cascades that lead to altered expression of a number of genes in the cell nucleus; a key challenge in biomedicine is to identify which genes respond to a specific stimulus. These so called response genes can be investigated on a whole-genome scale with genomic sequencing, which is a technology that can quantify protein binding to DNA or gene activation. Analysis of such whole-genome data, however, is challenging due to billions of data points measured in the experiments. Here we introduce a novel computational method, SPINLONG, which is a widely applicable novel computational method that integrates multiple levels of deep sequencing data to produce experimentally testable hypotheses. We applied SPINLONG to breast cancer data and found early responsive genes for estrogen receptor and analyzed their regulation. These analyses resulted in a gene whose high activity is associated with decreased breast cancer patient survival.
