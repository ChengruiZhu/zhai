Interstitial Cajal-like Cells (ICLC) were recently recognized in a plethora of non-digestive organs. Here, we describe a cell type of rat mesentery sharing ultrastructural and immunohistochemical features with ICLC. Mesenteric ICLC were demonstrated by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and further tested by light microscope immunohistochemistry. The cell described here fulfils the TEM diagnostic criteria accepted for ICLC: location in the connective interstitium; close vicinity to nerves, capillaries and other interstitial cells; characteristic long, moniliform cell processes; specialized cell-to-cell junctions; caveolae; mitochondria at 5–10% of cytoplasmic volume; rough endoplasmic reticulum at about 1–2%; intermediate and thin filaments, microtubules; undetectable thick filaments. The processes of this mesenteric ICLC were particularly long, with a mean length of 24.91 μm (10.27–50.83 μm), and a convolution index of 2.32 (1.37–3.63) was calculated in order to measure their potential length. Mean distances versus main target cells of ICLC–nerve bundles, vessels, adipocytes and macrophages–were 110.69, 115.80, 205.07 and 34.65 nm, respectively. We also tested the expression of CD117/c-kit, CD34, vimentin, α-smooth muscle actin, nestin, NK-1, tryptase and chymase and the antigenic profile of the mesenteric ICLC was comparable if not identical with that recently observed in ICLC from other extra-digestive tissues. Due to the peculiar aspect of the mesenteric ICLC processes it can be hypothesized that these cells form a three-dimensional network within the mesentery that is at the same time resistant and deformable following stretches consequent to intestine movements, mainly avoiding blood vessels closure or controlling blood vessels rheology. It remains, however, to be established if and how such cells are connected with the archetypal enteric ICC.
