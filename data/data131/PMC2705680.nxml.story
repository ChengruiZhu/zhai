p53-response elements (p53-REs) are 20 base pair DNA segments embedded in the genome that are able to bind anti-tumor protein p53 and trigger biological functions such as DNA repair or self-destruction of the cell. These functions are modulated through selective binding of p53 to degenerate p53-REs. Understanding how the cells choose p53-REs for enacting a specific biological function is crucial for obtaining insight into cancer development. Experimental data indicate that the majority of p53-REs contain a small intervening spacer in the middle of their p53-REs. Here, we propose that there is a relationship between the organization of the p53-REs and binding cooperativity. To test this hypothesis, analysis of existing crystal structures and modeling of p53-DNA complexes was undertaken. The outcome shows that when there are 0â€“2 base pair spacers, there are more interactions between the p53 subunits, and the p53-DNA binding is cooperative. When the spacer sizes are larger, the interactions among p53 subunits are diminished. Our results indicate that cooperativity of the p53-DNA association dominates the genomic organization of the p53-REs and suggest that different mechanisms of activation may be at play for those p53-REs with large spacers.
