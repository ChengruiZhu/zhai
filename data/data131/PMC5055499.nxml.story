Haematopoiesis is the term used to describe the production of blood cells. This is a tightly regulated hierarchical system in which mature circulating blood cells develop from a small population of haematopoietic stem (HSC) and progenitor cells within the microenvironment of the bone marrow. Molecular and genetic abnormalities arising in these stem cells lead to a block in the normal programme of proliferation and differentiation and result in the development of the blood cancers known as the leukaemias and lymphomas. Recently the regulatory role of the bone marrow microenvironment or niche has also become increasingly recognised. The interface between the bone and bone marrow (endosteum) and the region surrounding the blood vessels (perivascular) provide distinct niches harbouring quiescent HSC or proliferative HSC respectively. Current chemotherapeutic regimes can often successfully target the proliferative HSC but disease relapse occurs due to residual quiescent HSC. Understanding these developmental and regulatory processes and the associated cell communication mechanisms are thus crucial to the development of new treatment strategies. The CCN family of proteins have been recognised to play a key role in all aspects of haematopoiesis.
