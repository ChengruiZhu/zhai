Kidney renal papillary cell carcinoma (KIRP) accounts for 10%â€“15% of renal cell carcinoma (RCC), patients with KIRP tend to have a poor prognosis, and there was a lack of effective prognostic indicators for this type of cancer. Currently, owing to the availability of The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), long non-coding RNAs (LncRNAs) have been discovered to indicate a prognostic value in some tumors. In that regard, we analyzed lncRNA-sequencing data of KIRP in TCGA, and among 780 differentially-expressed lncRNAs, we selected 37 lncRNAs which were able to assist the prognosis. In addition, by using the multivariate cox regression analysis, the prognosis index (PI) that consisted of 7 lncRNAs (including AFAP1-AS1, GAS6-AS1, RP11-1C8.7, RP11-21L19.1, RP11-503C24.1, RP11-536I6.2, and RP11-63A11.1) could predict the progression and outcomes of KIRP with accuracy. More importantly, the PI was considered an independent indicator for prognostication of KIRP. Moreover, having categorized patients with KIRP into cohorts of high risk and low risk, according to the PI, we found that the key genes and pathways varied in these two groups. Overall, these LncRNAs, especially the PI, may be conceived as biomarkers and helpful for determining the different pathological stages for KIRP patients. However, their biological functions need to be further confirmed.
