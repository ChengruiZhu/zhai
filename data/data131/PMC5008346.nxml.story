MicroRNAs are critical in various human cancers, including gastric cancer (GC). However, the mechanism underlying the GC development remains elusive. In this study, we demonstrate that miR-448 is increased in GC samples and cell lines. Overexpression of miR-448 facilitated the proliferation of GC cells by stimulating glycolysis. Mechanistically, we identified KDM2B, a reader for methylated CpGs, as the target of miR-448 that represses glycolysis and promotes oxidative phosphorylation. Overexpression of miR-448 reduced both the mRNA and protein levels of KDM2B, whereas KDM2B re-expression abrogated the miR-448-mediated glycolytic activities. Furthermore, we discovered Myc as a key target of KDM2B that controls metabolic switch in GC. Importantly, a cohort of 81 GC tissues revealed that miR-448 level closely associated with a battery of glycolytic genes, in which KDM2B showed the strongest anti-correlation coefficient. In addition, enhanced miR-448 level was significantly associated with poor clinical outcomes of GC patients. Hence, we identified a previously unappreciated mechanism by which miR-448 orchestrate epigenetic, transcriptional and metabolic networks to promote GC progression, suggesting the possibility of therapeutic intervention against cancer metabolic pathways.
