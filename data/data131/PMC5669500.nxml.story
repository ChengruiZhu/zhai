Cells use autophagy to recycle and degrade a wide range of materials, from individual molecules to entire organelles. We perform simulations to study a key step in the initial stages of the autophagy pathway: how the membrane adopts the characteristic cup shape of the phagophore that then engulfs its targets. We find that dimers of the protein Atg17 play a critical role in this membrane shape transition. Atg17 dimers form the 34-nm long, double-crescent shaped core of the Atg1 complex, which is known to be present at the “phagophore assembly site” of yeast. To study protein-assisted membrane remodeling, we integrate coarse-grained protein complexes into a model of membrane shape dynamics. In our simulations, we find that multiple Atg17 dimers cooperate to remove the barriers for the transitions from tube to disk shapes, and from disk to phagophore shapes. In experiment, we confirmed that perturbations of Atg17 membrane interaction have a substantial influence on autophagy induction, up to a to complete loss of detectable autophagic activity. Our combination of simulations and experiments thus shed light on a membrane-shaping function of the unusually shaped Atg1 complex in phagophore assembly.
