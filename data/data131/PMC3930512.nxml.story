New species are created when barriers to reproduction form between groups of organisms that formerly interbred freely. Reduced fertility or viability of hybrid offspring is a common form of reproductive isolation. Hybrid defects are caused by negative interactions between genes that have undergone evolutionary change within each subgroup. Identifying genetic interactions causing disease or trait variation is very difficult, consequently there are few known hybrid incompatibility genes and even fewer cases where both interacting genes are known. Here, we combined mapping of gene expression levels in testis with previous results mapping male sterility traits in hybrid house mice. This new approach to finding genetic causes of reproductive barriers enabled us to identify a large number of hybrid incompatibilities, involving genomic regions with known roles in hybrid sterility and previously unknown regions. Understanding the number and type of genetic interactions is important for developing accurate models used to reconstruct speciation events. The genetics of hybrid sterility in mice may also contribute to understanding basic processes involved in male reproduction and causes of human infertility.
