Pigment patterns are some of the most distinctive, diverse and aesthetically pleasing traits of vertebrates. In turn, these patterns offer an outstanding opportunity to understand the mechanisms underlying the development of adult form and how such mechanisms change evolutionarily. Among the especially wide-ranging pigment patterns of teleost fishes, the most thoroughly studied example is the horizontal striping of zebrafish. In this species, stripes result from the precise arrangements of three classes of pigment cells: black melanophores, yellow or orange xanthophores and silvery iridophores. Previous studies showed that stripe formation requires interactions between melanophores and xanthophores. Nevertheless, roles for factors in the tissue environment experienced by pigment cells, as well as roles for iridophores in the pattern-forming process, have remained largely unexplored. Here we identify molecular mechanisms through which pigment cells are supported as the pattern develops. We further show that stripe development requires not only interactions between melanophores and xanthophores but iridophores as well, identifying a complex, pattern-generating system that may be applicable to understanding patterns and diversity across species. Our findings thus highlight the critical role of the “canvas” on which the pattern is painted, as well as the developmental artistry through which the “paints” are applied.
