We experienced a case with fetal cardiac tumor, which was diagnosed by prenatal ultrasonographic examination, and the diagnosis was confirmed after birth. A pregnancy woman of the 26th week of gestation was referred to our hospital for close examinations of fetal cardiac tumor. Ultrasonographic examinations revealed single homogeneous tumor with the diameter of 14 mm intracardiac space. The tumor was considered to emerge from the ventricular septum and to be occupied in left ventricle. Other cardiac abnormalities were not detected. The fetus was diagnosed to be complicated with the intracardiac tumor, and with the possible rhabdomyoma of heart. The serial ultrasonographic examinations revealed that the fetal cardiac function was normal. The size of the tumor gradually increased, although the fetal cardiac function revealed within normal range. The patient delivered a female infant weighing 2716g with the Apgar score of 9 and 10 at one and 5 minutes after delivery. The infant was confirmed to have cardiac tumors after examination by pediatric cardiologist, and the cardiac function of the infant was diagnosed as normal condition. The computed tomography of the head revealed the intracranial multiple calcification lesions, which indicated the symptoms of tuberous sclerosis.
