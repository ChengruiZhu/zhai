Cardiac hypertrophy (CH) is an independent risk factor for cardiovascular diseases (CVDs). Mitigating or preventing CH is the most effective strategy for the treatment of CVDs. DanHong injection (DH) is a Chinese herbal medicine preparation (CHMP) widely used in clinical treatment of several CVDs in China. However, the direct targets and cellular mechanisms for these protective effects remain unclear. This study was designed to illustrate the direct targets of DH in protecting against CH and investigate CH molecular pathogenesis. A hypertrophic cell model was induced by endothelin-1 (ET-1) on human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (hiPS-CMs). Real time cellular analysis (RTCA) cardio system and high content analysis (HCA) were used to detect the changes in contractile function, morphology and protein level of hypertrophic hiPS-CMs. Agonist and antagonist assay on receptors were performed using calcium mobilization high-throughput screening (HTS). DH significantly attenuated CH by modulating myocardial contractility, suppressing cell area enlargement and down-regulating ET-1-induced brain natriuretic peptide (BNP), actinin alpha 2 (ACTN2) and cardiac muscle troponin T (TNNT2) protein expression (
