DNA methyltransferase 3A (DNMT3A) mutations occurred in 18%~23% of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients, and were considered to be an adverse prognostic factor for adult de novo AML cases. However, the relevant molecular mechanism of the mutation in AML pathogenesis remains obscure. In this study, we established K562 and SKM1 cell model carrying the DNMT3A R882H mutation via transcription activator-like effector nuclease (TALEN) and Clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR/Cas9) technology, and discovered that mutated DNMT3A could promote the proliferative capability of malignant cell clones. Further RNA microarray analysis revealed that some genes crucial for glutathione (GSH) synthesis, including CTH, PSPH, PSAT1 and especially SLC7A11 (the cysteine/glutamate transporter) were significantly up-regulated, which resulted in significant elevation of intracellular GSH levels. A subsequent experiment demonstrated that the mutant clones are resistant to chemotherapy as well as SLC7A11-inhibitorsBy shRNA induced SLC7A11 silencing, we discovered profoundly decreased cellular GSH and cell proliferative ability of DNMT3A mutated clones. Our results provided novel insight into the role of the DNMT3A R882H mutation in AML pathogenesis and suggested that targeting the cellular GSH synthetic pathway could enhance the current therapy for AML patients with the DNMT3A R882H mutation.
