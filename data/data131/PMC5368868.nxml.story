The aim of the study was to find the correlation between CRP and chemerin in development of DN. We choose 90 type-2 diabetic patients between February 2010 and February 2013, who were then divided into DN group and healthy control group. The results of BP showed that there is no difference in SBP and DBP of patients in the three groups. HDL-C of patients in diabetic group and DN group is lower compared with control. CRP in diabetic group and DN group is higher than that of patients in control group. Comparing the patients in DN group with that in diabeteic group, CRP was significantly higher. Chemerin level in the diabetic group and DN group is higher than control group. When comparing the patients in DN group with those in diabeteic group, serum level of chemerin was significantly higher. Serum level of chemerin is negatively correlated with HDL-C and positively correlated with FPG, HbA1c, LDL-C, BUN and Scr. Serum CRP is negatively correlated with HDL-C and positively correlated with FPG, HbA1c, LDL-C, BUN and Scr. Serum level of chemerin is positively correlated with CRP (r=0.701, P<0.05). CRP and chemerin of the DN patients rose significantly, and may participate in the occurrence and development of DN.
