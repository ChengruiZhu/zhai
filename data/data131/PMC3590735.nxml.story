Squamous cell carcinomas of the gingiva make up a significant percentage of oral squamous cell carcinomas and are one of the most common causes of death worldwide. Cancers of the gingiva often escape early detection, and hence an early intervention, since their initial signs and symptoms resemble common dental and periodontal infections. This article presents a case of a 29-year-old female patient who presented with a non-healing wound for about 1.5 months post-extraction. The wound was associated with pain and suppuration. A provisional diagnosis of alveolar osteitis was derived at with a differential diagnosis of osteomyelitis and carcinoma of the alveolus. The patient was advised a complete hemogram, orthopantomograph, and intra-oral periapical radiograph of the extraction socket. An incisional biopsy was carried out. Radiographs revealed extensive bone loss, and the biopsy report confirmed the diagnosis of well-differentiated squamous cell carcinoma of the alveolus. Carcinoma of the gingiva often mimics inflammatory lesions and hence is often misdiagnosed. Therefore, any oral lesion should strike a chord of suspicion, and practitioners should base their diagnosis on careful examination, and valid evidence.
