Fluorogold labeled ~3 per cent of neurons in the nodose ganglia with an average somal perimeter of 137 ± 6.2 μm (range 90–200 μm). All traced neurons (and seemingly all nodose neurons) were immunoreactive for NKCC1. Many (> 90 per cent) were also immunoreactive for vGlut2 and neurofilament and between 50 and 85 per cent expressed α1 ATPase, α3 ATPase or vGlut1. Cough receptor neurons that did not express the above markers could not be differentiated based on somal size, with the exception of neurofilament negative neurons which were significantly smaller (P < 0.05). Less than 10 per cent of fluorogold labeled neurons expressed substance P or CGRP (and these had somal perimeters less than 110 μm) and none expressed somatostatin, calretinin, calbindin or parvalbumin. Two distinct patterns of nNOS labeling was observed in the general population of nodose neurons: most neurons contained cytosolic clusters of moderately intense immunoreactivity whereas less than 10 per cent of neurons displayed uniform intensely fluorescent somal labeling. Less than 3 per cent of the retrogradely traced neurons were intensely fluorescent for nNOS (most showed clusters of nNOS immunoreactivity) and nNOS immunoreactivity was not expressed by cough receptor nerve terminals in the tracheal wall.
