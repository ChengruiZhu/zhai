Selectins play a critical role in initiating leukocyte binding to vascular endothelium. In addition, in vitro experiments have shown that neutrophils use L-selectin to roll on adherent neutrophils, suggesting that they express a nonvascular L-selectin ligand. Using a L- selectin/IgM heavy chain (mu) chimeric protein as an immunocytological probe, we show here that L-selectin can bind to neutrophils, monocytes, CD34+ hematopoietic progenitors, and HL-60 and KG-1 myeloid cells. The interaction between L-selectin and leukocytes was protease sensitive and calcium dependent, and abolished by cell treatment with neuraminidase, chlorate, or O-sialoglycoprotein endopeptidase. These results revealed common features between leukocyte L-selectin ligand and the mucin-like P-selectin glycoprotein ligand 1 (PSGL-1), which mediates neutrophil rolling on P- and E-selectin. The possibility that PSGL-1 could be a ligand for L-selectin was further supported by the ability of P-selectin/mu chimera to inhibit L-selectin/mu binding to leukocytes and by the complete inhibition of both selectin interactions with myeloid cells treated with mocarhagin, a cobra venom metalloproteinase that cleaves the amino terminus of PSGL-1 at Tyr-51. Finally, the abrogation of L- and P-selectin binding to myeloid cells treated with a polyclonal antibody, raised against a peptide corresponding to the amino acid residues 42-56 of PSGL-1, indicated that L- and P-selectin interact with a domain located at the amino- terminal end of PSGL-1. The ability of the anti-PSGL-1 mAb PL-1 to inhibit L- and P-selectin binding to KG-1 cells further supported that possibility. Thus, apart from being involved in neutrophil rolling on P- and E-selectin, PSGL-1 also plays a critical role in mediating neutrophil attachment to adherent neutrophils. Interaction between L- selectin and PSGL-1 may be of major importance for increasing leukocyte recruitment at inflammatory sites.
