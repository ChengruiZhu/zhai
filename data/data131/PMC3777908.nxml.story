Hemoglobin transports oxygen from our lungs to other tissues. Its effectiveness in binding and unbinding of oxygen is based on a type of regulation called allostery. Thereby, already bound oxygen molecules in either of the four binding sites of hemoglobin increase the likelihood of oxygen binding in the other sites; the sites act cooperatively. It is known that the four protein chains of hemoglobin – each containing one oxygen binding site – need to rearrange globally or the cooperativity is lost. But how do the individual chains communicate with each other in this rearrangement? This is still not resolved on the molecular level. By applying the computational technique of molecular dynamics simulations we were able to simulate the motions of the individual atoms of hemoglobin during such a global rearrangement. We present a novel method that allows to directly analyse the coupling of motions within and between the four protein chains and thereby reveal the allosteric mechanism. That allows us to classify which amino acids are important for the cooperativity and in what way: by either pushing other amino acids away or attracting them. Also, we have observed in simulations how pH differences could affect the cooperativity.
