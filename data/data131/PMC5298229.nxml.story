Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) signaling is a potent regulator of angiogenesis, the growth and development of new vessels out of a preexisting vascular network. Angiogenesis requires enhanced survival, proliferation, and motility of the vascular endothelial cells. Crucial signaling endpoints in VEGF-mediated angiogenic response include elevation in intracellular calcium and the activation of the proteins ERK1 and 2 (ERK1/2). In this study, we have developed a novel computer model for the activation of ERK1/2 and calcium downstream of VEGF receptor type 2 (VEGFR2). Our model is the first of its kind to incorporate and investigate the consequences of calcium elevation and the role of a cellular lipid modifier known as sphingosine kinase 1 (SphK1). We also utilize the model to simulate therapeutic strategies targeting VEGF signaling to ERK1/2 indicating inefficiency of single therapies known as tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI) that target receptor phosphorylation. Computer simulations indicate that combination therapy is essential for effective blockade of this important pathway. Our results have important implications for human diseases such as cancer where plethora of anti-VEGF therapies are currently employed. Overall, our computer model sheds new light on a complex feedback involving SphK1 and calcium that radically alters the response of cells to VEGF.
