30 patients after the anatomical reconstruction of ACL took part in this study (23 male, and 7 female, mean age = 28 ± 10,6 years). During the procedure a patellar tendon graft was used. The Insali-Salvati ratio measured with MRI (images taken pre-procedural, and 9 months after the surgery) was used for the assessment of patellar alignment. The measurements were taken by one radiology specialist on MRI scans in sagittal view in PD sequence. During the examination, patellar joint was in flexion (approx.10 degrees). As the point of reference for patella’s position ISR ratio was in the range of 0.8 - 1.2. All patients were operated on by the same team of surgeons and underwent an unified rehabilitation programme led by a team of selected physiotherapists. The main features of the programme were: an early muscle activation (second day after the procedure); mobilisation of the patella and tissues of the anterior compartment of the knee; weight bearing co-contraction exercises, and the sensomotoric training of the entire kinetic chain of the lower limb. The data recorded was statistically analysed using the Wilcoxon signed-rank test in order to establish parameters’ changes within the study group..
