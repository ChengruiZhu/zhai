The duplication of the genetic material is a highly conserved and tightly regulated process that is essential for cell proliferation. DNA synthesis initiates at sites called origins that are distributed throughout the genome. Replication origins are not all used equivalently, and their patterns of activation along the chromosomes give rise to specific profiles, or programs, of DNA replication. These programs change during development and in response to external stimuli, and we have previously shown that they have important consequences for cellular function. However, we still do not understand the mechanisms by which cells establish different replication patterns. Here we investigate the role of the cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) family of proteins, whose activities are critical for cell cycle progression, in regulating the organization of genome duplication. Taking advantage of a system that allows us to precisely modulate CDK activity levels in living cells, we demonstrate that both the temporal and quantitative controls of CDK function are crucial for determining distinct programs of DNA replication. Our work therefore uncovers a fundamental link between CDK activity, a central input in a variety of cellular and developmental processes, and the architecture of genome duplication.
