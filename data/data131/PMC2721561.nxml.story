The medical care of adolescents has become a growth area in many disciplines. There are two major aspects. Firstly, adolescents have specific medical and emotional needs which are not fulfilled either by paediatric or by adult specialists. Secondly, some childhood problems, particularly the congenital deformities, have no equivalent in adult life and so lifelong care is mandatory. Renal damage, especially dysplasia and scarring, leads to a substantial risk of early onset hypertension and, occasionally, to renal failure. Bladder outlet obstruction in utero, such as from a posterior urethral valve, causes irreversible changes to the wall that will act adversely on the kidneys in adolescence or early adulthood. The incidence of renal failure in early adulthood is about 36%. Bladder reconstruction with bowel has been very beneficial in preventing renal failure and improving continence. Life long follow-up is needed because of the high incidence of complications. These include stones, hyperchloraemic acidosis, perforation, anastomotic stenosis and, possibly, cancer. Patients have a normal expectation of sexuality and fertility. Their desires cannot always be achieved but they require considerable emotional and surgical support.
