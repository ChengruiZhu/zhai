Most ligand-receptor interactions result in an immediate generation of various second messengers and a subsequent association of the ligand- receptor complex to the cytoskeleton. Depending on the receptor involved, this linkage to the cytoskeleton has been suggested to play a role in the termination of second messenger generation and/or the endocytic process whereby the ligand-receptor complex is internalized. We have studied how the binding of chemotactic peptide-receptor complexes to the cytoskeleton of human neutrophils is accomplished. As much as 76% of the tritiated formylmethionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine (fMet- Leu-[3H]Phe) specifically bound to intact cells, obtained by a 30-s stimulation with 20 nM fMet-Leu-[3H]Phe, still remained after Triton X- 100 extraction. Preincubating intact cells with dihydrocytochalasin B (dhCB) or washing the cytoskeletal preparation with a high concentration of potassium, reduced the binding of ligand-receptor complexes to the cytoskeleton by 46% or more. Inhibition of fMet-Leu- Phe-induced generation of second messengers by ADP-ribosylating the alpha-subunit of the receptor-coupled G-protein with pertussis toxin, did not reduce the binding of ligand-receptor complexes to the cytoskeleton. However, using guanosine-5'-O-(2-thiodiphosphate) (GDP beta S) to prevent the dissociation of the fMet-Leu-Phe-associated G- protein within electrically permeabilized cells, led to a pronounced reduction (62%) of the binding between ligand-receptor complexes and the cytoskeleton. In summary, in human neutrophils the rapid association between chemotactic peptide-receptor complexes and the cytoskeleton is dependent on filamentous actin. This association is most likely regulated by the activation and dissociation of the fMet- Leu-Phe-associated G-protein.
