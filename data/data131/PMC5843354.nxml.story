The genes and signalling pathways involved in ectodermal organ development (teeth, hair, mammary glands, etc.) are relatively well studied. However, the bio-mechanical processes by which these organs grow and change shape from an early primordium (an epithelial bud similar among different organs) is far less understood, especially in mammalian development. This study combines simple experiments and a multi-scale, cell-based computational model to understand these processes for one ectodermal organ: the tooth. Our model implements the different mechanical properties of the different cell types involved in morphogenesis (i.e. epithelial and mesencymal) and their interactions. By exploring model behaviour and contrasting it with experimental data on tissue growth rates and mechanics we found that, in spite of their relative complexity, the shape changes occurring in early tooth development, the overall sharpness of the tooth and its variation can largely be explained by the two most simple bio-mechanical processes: differential growth and differential adhesion between tooth tissues. These results suggest that simple mechanical interactions between cells and tissues may underlie the complex tissue deformations observed in the morphogenesis of several ectodermal organs.
