The complex nature of primary-open angle glaucoma (POAG) has left researchers exploring the genetic architecture and searching for the missing heritability using a number of different study designs. Over the past decade, many studies have been conducted to explain the etiology of POAG; however, a high proportion of estimated heritability still remains unexplained. GWA studies for POAG have identified significant associations but these associations have only explained a small proportion of the genetic risk (odds ratios range between 1â€“3). In this paper, we sought to confirm the primary genome-wide significant associations that have been discovered so far for glaucoma in phenotypes developed from EMR data in an effort to show that EMR data can be a powerful resource for finding genetic variants influencing POAG susceptibility. Next, we tested for statistical interactions, which can be presented as an important tool in an attempt to explain POAG heritability. We used a reduced list of variants filtered by marginal main effect analysis to look for epistatic interactions. We present our results from replication of gene-based interaction analyses performed in eMERGE and the NEIGHBOR consortium data. Using expression data and annotations from various publicly available databases, the most significant genes that replicated in our analyses show expression in the eye and trabecular meshwork. Analysis for estimation of genetic variance explained by significant associations from previous GWAS and replicated variants from gene-based interactions suggest that these explain 5.6% of variance in eMERGE dataset and also explain 3.4% variance in NEIGHBOR dataset.
