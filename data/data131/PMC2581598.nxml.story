Wrapping of eukaryotic genomes by the histone proteins impacts virtually all known DNA templates processes. Covalent modification of the histone proteins has emerged as a key mechanism for regulation of transcription and other processes. Here, we report high-resolution genomic mapping of a relatively recently described modification, H3K56 acetylation. We find that H3K56ac is localized at all known sites of nucleosome incorporation, not only during genomic replication, but also during replication-independent nucleosome replacement. By measuring changes in histone replacement during M phase (when K56ac is erased by deacetylases), we find evidence suggesting that histone replacement may help control genomic replication programs. Finally, analysis of histone replacement in mutants in the K56 acetylation pathway provide evidence for self-reinforcing patterns of histone replacement, where replacement of a fresh nucleosome is slower than replacement of a nucleosome that has already been replaced once. These results provide a broad perspective on histone incorporation throughout the cell cycle and deepen our understanding of the relationship between histone turnover and histone modification.
