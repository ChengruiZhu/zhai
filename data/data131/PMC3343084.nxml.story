Axons extend great distances to make precise synaptic connections in the developing nervous system. Axons are guided to their targets by the growth cone, a dynamic structure at the axon distal tip that senses extracellular cues telling the axon where to go. In response to guidance cues, growth cones alter their shape and motility resulting in outgrowth and turning. The cytoskeleton (actin and microtubules) underlies growth cone motility and guidance. The signaling mechanisms linking guidance receptors to cytoskeletal change remain mysterious. Here, we define a new signaling mechanism downstream of the guidance receptor UNC-40/DCC involving the GTPases CDC-42 and Rac, which have long been known to control growth cone protrusion. We show that CDC-42 and Rac act in a linear pathway in axon guidance; CDC-42 acts upstream of the GTPase regulatory molecule TIAM-1, which is a GTP exchange factor specific for Rac and which activates Rac signaling. We also show that TIAM-1 acts with UNC-40/DCC signaling in protrusion and axon guidance. Our results imply that Rac GTPase function in axon guidance is complex and that distinct GEFs (TIAM-1 and UNC-73/Trio) might control Rac GTPases in different aspects of axon guidance.
