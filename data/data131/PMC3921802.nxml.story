A female patient from a remote village and poor socioeconomic background presented to our clinic with abdominal pain at the right flank. She had a history of endoscopic double J stent placement four years prior. However, the details were not available, as neither the patient nor her relatives were aware of the history. An ultrasonography was performed and revealed moderate hydronephrosis of the right kidney with two calculi measuring 2.9 cm at the pyeloureteral junction (PUJ), a 2.6 cm calculus in the renal pelvis, and a 4 cm vesicle calculus. An intravenous urography revealed delayed excretion of contrast medium in the right kidney. A cystoscopy was then performed and the lower end of the forgotten double J stent was cut along with the encrusted stone in bladder [1, 2]. Removal of the large encrusted bladder stone was aided by lithotripsy. This was followed by the removal of the two PUJ calculi and the remaining portion of the encrusted double J stent, which was extracted with relative ease via a right-sided open pyelolithotomy [3]. The post-operative course was uneventful and her kidney function test was absolutely normal following the procedures. The patient was found to be stone-free and was discharged home. In light of this situation we have deemed it necessary to maintain contact and ensure regular follow-up visits for patients with double J stent placements in order to avoid such dangerous complications in the future. By following this custom, we aim to reduce the patient morbidity and avoid any unnecessary inconvenience.
