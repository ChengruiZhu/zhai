Sixty six patients of either sex with a diagnosis of schizophrenia as per DSM III-R criteria were enrolled in an open, non-comparative study. They were treated with loxapine over a duration of 6 weeks. The assessment of the patients was carried out using the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) and Clinical global Impression (CGI) Scale. The side effects were noted on the Extrapyramidal Rating Scale and Asberg Scale for side effects. There was a statistically significant improvement in all the item scores of PANSS except ‘Guilt Feeling’ and ‘Depression’. A similar significant improvement was also observed in the factor scores and cluster scores of PANSS. On analysis there was substantial improvement in the negative scale ratings on PANSS in the negative subtyped group (13 sub). The average dose of loxapine received by patients at the time of completion of the study was 96.75+36 mg per day. The most commonly reported side effects were dryness of mouth, constipation & drowsiness. Loxapine appeared to be effective and well tolerated in the treatment of acute exacerbation in schizophrenia. Evaluation of loxapine in the treatment of negative symptoms of schizophrenia merits particular attention.
