Plasmode is a term used to describe a data set that has been derived from real data but for which some truth is known. Statistical methods that analyze data from high dimensional experiments (HDEs) seek to estimate quantities that are of interest to scientists, such as mean differences in gene expression levels and false discovery rates. The ability of statistical methods to accurately estimate these quantities depends on theoretical derivations or computer simulations. In computer simulations, data for which the true value of a quantity is known are often simulated from statistical models, and the ability of a statistical method to estimate this quantity is evaluated on the simulated data. However, in HDEs there are many possible statistical models to use, and which models appropriately produce data that reflect properties of real data is an open question. We propose the use of plasmodes as one answer to this question. If done carefully, plasmodes can produce data that reflect reality while maintaining the benefits of simulated data. We show one method of generating plasmodes and illustrate their use by comparing the performance of 15 statistical methods for estimating the false discovery rate in data from an HDE.
