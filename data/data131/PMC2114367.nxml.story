A 365-bp fragment from the 5' region of the human transferrin receptor gene has been subcloned and sequenced. This fragment contains 115 bp of flanking sequence, the first exon, and a portion of the first intron. It contains a TATA box, several GC-rich regions, and is able to efficiently promote expression of the bacterial CAT gene in mouse 3T3 cells. Sequence comparisons demonstrate that this DNA segment has homology to the promoter regions of the human dihydrofolate reductase gene and the mouse interleukin 3 gene, as well as to a monkey DNA sequence that has homology to the SV40 origin and promotes expression of an unidentified gene product. Several high molecular mass proteins that interact with the transferrin receptor gene promoter have been identified. The activity of these proteins is transiently increased in 3T3 cells that have been stimulated by serum addition. This increase precedes a rise in transferrin receptor mRNA levels in the cytoplasm, which in turn precedes entry of the cells into S phase. DNase I footprinting of the transferrin receptor promoter reveals several protein binding sites. Two of the sites are within the conserved GC- rich region of the promoter. One of these binding sites probably interacts with Spl, while the second interacts with an uncharacterized protein.
