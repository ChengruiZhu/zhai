In eukaryotes, mRNAs include a stretch of adenosine nucleotides at their 3′ end termed the poly(A) tail. In the cytoplasm, the poly(A) tail stimulates translation of the mRNA into protein, and protects the transcript from degradation. Evidence suggests that poly(A) tails may play distinct roles in RNA metabolism in the nucleus, but little is known about these functions and mechanisms. We show here that poly(A) tails can stimulate transcript decay in the nucleus, a function mediated by the ubiquitous nuclear poly(A) binding protein PABPN1. We find that PABPN1 is required for the degradation of a viral nuclear noncoding RNA as well as an inefficiently exported human mRNA. Importantly, the targeting of RNAs to this decay pathway requires the PABPN1 and poly(A) polymerase-dependent extension of the poly(A) tail. Nuclear transcripts with longer poly(A) tails are then selectively degraded by components of the nuclear exosome. These studies elucidate mechanisms that mammalian cells use to ensure proper mRNA “quality control” and may be important to regulate the expression of nuclear noncoding RNAs. Furthermore, our results suggest that the poly(A) tail has diverse and context-specific roles in gene expression.
