Bone marrow involvement (BMI) is a well‐known poor prognostic factor in patients with diffuse large B‐cell lymphoma (DLBCL). This study robustly investigated the significance of monoclonal immunoglobulin gene rearrangement combined with histologic B‐cell aggregates in bone marrow (BM) in the detection of a poor prognostic group. Pretreatment BM samples of 394 DLBCL patients were analyzed via the immunoglobulin gene rearrangement study and the microscopic examination. Monoclonal immunoglobulin gene rearrangement was detected in 25.4% of cases. Histologic B‐cell aggregates with the features of large B‐cell lymphoma aggregates, small cell B‐cell lymphoma aggregates, or B‐cell aggregates of unknown biological potential were observed in 12% of cases (6.9%, 1.3%, and 3.8%, respectively). Histologic B‐cell aggregates were more associated with monoclonality than polyclonality. Cases with both monoclonality and histologic B‐cell aggregates demonstrated close association with poor prognostic factors such as a higher International Prognostic Index score and showed an inferior overall survival rate when compared to cases with only monoclonality or only histologic B‐cell aggregates. From the findings, a combination of monoclonality and histologic B‐cell aggregates within the bone marrow was highly associated with poor prognosis and could be used to determine high‐risk DLBLC patients with greater sensitivity and specificity than conventional microscopic examination or immunoglobulin gene rearrangement study alone.
