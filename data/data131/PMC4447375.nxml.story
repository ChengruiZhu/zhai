Sleep is important for long lasting memories. There exists, however, a controversy regarding the mechanisms by which sleep modifies synapses to consolidate enduring memories. One theory posits that sleep weakens synapses, leading to the forgetting of all but the strongest memories. The alternative theory proposes that sleep promotes both weakening and strengthening of different connections, the latter through a process known as long-term potentiation (LTP). Here we measured the levels of a phosphorylated protein related to LTP during the sleep cycle of rats and used the data to build models of sleep-dependent synaptic plasticity. By feeding one model with spikes recorded from the rat hippocampus, we observed that LTP during sleep not merely strengthens certain connections, but actually reorganizes how these connections are ranked in strength, leading to substantial changes of the overall pattern. A more detailed model of hippocampus and cortex showed that the interaction of the mechanisms predicted by the competing theories promotes a more efficient control of which memories are stored. Our results provide a step forward in the understanding of the cognitive role of sleep by indicating that the current competing theories are not mutually exclusive. Instead, each constitutes an important stage of memory consolidation.
