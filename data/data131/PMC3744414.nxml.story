Males and females exhibit many differences in morphology, behavior and physiology, yet they share the vast majority of their genomes. Most differences between the sexes are therefore thought to be the product of gene expression differences between females and males. Studies of sex differences in expression assume that genes expressed more in males encode male traits, and genes expressed more in females encode female traits, and this assumption is a key foundation to genetic studies of sexual dimorphism and sexual conflict. Despite this key assumption, this relationship has yet to be empirically tested, as the main model organisms for studies of sex-biased gene expression lack multiple male and female morphs. Here, we use the two male morphs in the wild turkey to show that the magnitude of male-biased gene expression correlates with the manifestation of sexually dimorphic traits. Males with less manifestation of sexual dimorphism in phenotype were both demasculinized for male-biased genes, as well as feminized for female-biased genes. This pattern encompassed the majority of expressed loci, suggesting that evolutionary changes in the magnitude of sexual dimorphism may be achieved by small changes in the magnitude of sex-biased transcription across thousands of genes.
