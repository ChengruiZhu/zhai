 on wheat plants, the electrical penetration graph or electropenetrography (EPG) technique was applied. Nine EPG waveforms (types/subtypes) were identified and described on stem and on ear head of wheat plants, as follows: Z, Np, Df1a, Df1b, Df2, Df3a, Df3b, Df4a, and Df4b. For the waveforms Df1, Df2, Df3, and Df4, stylets were severed to determine, via histological studies, the location of the stylet tip and/or salivary sheath tip in plant tissue. Waveform Z was visually correlated with the bug standing still on the plant surface, whereas during Np the bug was walking. Df1a and Df1b represent initial stylet insertion, deep penetration of the stylets into the plant tissue, and secretion of salivary sheath. Df2 represents xylem sap ingestion on stem and on ear head. Waveforms Df3a and Df4a were related to the cell rupturing feeding strategy (laceration and maceration tactics) on stem and on ear head (seed endosperm), respectively. Waveforms Df3b and Df4b represent ingestion of cellular contents derived from cell rupturing activities on stem and on ear head (seed endosperm), respectively. With this fundamental knowledge in hand, future studies can use EPG to develop novel pest management solutions.
