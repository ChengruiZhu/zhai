Antibody-targeted superantigen has been developed into a new strategy to treat many malignant tumors. In this study, for specific targeting to gastric cancer cell, superantigen SEB (Staphylococcal Enterotoxin B) was genetically fused to the single-chain variable fragment of gastric carcinoma-associated antibody MG7(MG7-scFv) that recognizes the MG7 antigen frequently expressed in gastric cancer cell. The recombinant MG7-scFv/SEB fusion proteins are expressed in E. coli as inclusion bodies, and the purified MG7-scFv/SEB retains high binding affinity with gastric cancer cell SGC-7901 (positive MG7 antigen expression). When incubated with effector cellâ€”peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), MG7-scFv/SEB could effectively inhibit the proliferation and induce apoptosis of SGC-7901. After being treated with MG7-scFv/SEB, PBMCs remarkably increased the production of Th1 cytokines (IFN-gamma, IL-2), and slightly increased the production of Th2 cytokines (IL-4, IL-10) in vitro. It was observed that gastric-tumor-bearing rats administrated with MG7-scFv/SEB showed more inflammatory cell infiltration, more significant tumor inhibition, and longer survival time than those of rats treated with SEB or NS (Normal Saline). The data indicated that MG7-scFv/SEB fusion protein could specifically target gastric cancer cell, enhance the activity of T cells and induce tumor cell apoptosis to exert the antitumor effect on gastric cancer.
