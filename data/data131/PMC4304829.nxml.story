During the past several decades, the incidence of human male reproductive abnormalities such as hypospadias, undescended testicles, testicular cancer, and low sperm counts has increased. Environmental factors—and in particular, exposure to environmental estrogens—have been implicated as contributing factors and, indeed, developmental exposure to a range of estrogenic chemicals induces similar defects in male rodents. Given the wide variety of ‘weak’ estrogenic chemicals found in everyday products, understanding how estrogenic exposures affect sperm production has direct human relevance. Here we show that brief exposure of newborn male mice to exogenous estrogen affects the developing spermatogonial stem cells of the testis and this, in turn, permanently alters spermatogenesis in the adult. Specifically, estrogens adversely affect meiotic recombination, a process that is essential for the production of haploid gametes. Subtle changes in the levels of recombination increase the incidence of meiotic errors, resulting in the elimination of cells before they become sperm. Thus, in addition to their other potential effects on the developing brain and reproductive tract, our results suggest that estrogenic exposures can act to reduce sperm production by affecting the spermatogonial stem cell pool of the developing testis.
