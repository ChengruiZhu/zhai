Breast cancer is the second leading cause of cancer death in women and the presence of metastasis significantly decreases survival. MicroRNAs are involved in tumor progression and the metastatic spreading of breast cancer. Here, we reported that a microRNA, mmu-miR-1894, significantly decreased the lung metastasis of 4TO7 mouse breast cancer cells by 86.7% in mouse models. Mmu-miR-1894-3p was the functional mature form of miR-1894 and significantly decreased the lung metastasis of 4TO7 cells by 90.8% in mouse models. A dual-luciferase reporter assay indicated that mmu-miR-1894-3p directly targeted the tripartite motif containing 46 (Trim46) 3â€²-untranslated region (UTR) and downregulated the expression of Trim46 in 4TO7 cells. Consistent with the effect of mmu-miR-1894-3p, knockdown of Trim46 inhibited the experimental lung metastasis of 4TO7 cells. Moreover, knockdown of human Trim46 also prohibited the cell proliferation, migration and wound healing of MBA-MD-231 human breast cancer cells. These results suggested that the effect of knockdown of Trim46 alone was sufficient to recapitulate the effect of mmu-miR-1894 on the metastasis of the breast cancer cells in mouse and that Trim46 was involved in the proliferation and migration of mouse and human breast cancer cells.
