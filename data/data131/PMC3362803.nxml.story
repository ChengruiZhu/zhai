This paper investigates the possibility for iron fortification of food using a new preparation method for protein gel particles in which iron is entrapped in the presence of ascorbate using cold-set gelation. The effect of ascorbate on the iron-induced cold-set gelation process of whey protein was studied in order to optimize the ratio of iron/ascorbate. Subsequently, the effect of ascorbate on iron bio-accessibility was assessed in vitro. Rheology was used to study the protein gel formation, and the stability of the gel particles was determined by measuring the iron and protein content at different pH. In vitro studies were performed with the TNO Intestinal Model (TIM). Ascorbate appeared to affect the gel formation process and increased the gel strength of the iron-induced cold-set gels at specific iron/ascorbate ratio. With the Feâ€“protein gel particles being stable at a broad pH range, the release of iron from the particles was studied as a function of time. The low release of iron indicated a good encapsulation efficiency and the capability of whey protein to keep iron bound at different conditions (pH and presence of calcium). Results obtained with the TIM showed that ascorbate, when added to the protein gel particles, was very successful in enhancing the recovery and absorption of iron. The in vitro Fe
