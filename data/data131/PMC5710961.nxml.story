Histone methylation is one of the major epigenetic modifications, and various histone methylases and demethylases participate in the epigenetic regulating. JMJD2C has been recently identified as one of the histone lysine demethylases. As one member of the Jumonji-C histone demethylase family, JMJD2C has the ability to demethylate tri- or di-methylated histone 3 and 2 in either K9 (lysine residue 9) or K36 (lysine residue 36) sites by an oxidative reaction, thereby affecting heterochromatin formation, genomic imprinting, X-chromosome inactivation, and transcriptional regulation of genes. JMJD2C was firstly found to involve in embryonic development and stem cell regulation. Afterwards, aberrant status of JMJD2C histone methylation was observed during the formation and development of various tumors, and it has been reported to play crucial roles in the progression of breast cancer, prostate carcinomas, osteosarcoma, blood neoplasms and so on, indicating that JMJD2C represents a promising anti-cancer target. In this review, we will focus on the research progress and prospect of JMJD2C in tumors, and provide abundant evidence for the functional application and therapeutic potential of targeting JMJD2C in tumors
