We performed a prospective cohort study of 1911 CHD patients aged 40 and older. Cox models were used to estimate the association of traditional factors [sex, age, fasting blood glucose (FBG), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), blood pressure (BP), and cigarette use] and risk scores with all-cause and cardiovascular mortality. During a mean follow-up of 4.9 years, 232 deaths were identified, 159 of which were cardiovascular-related. Both 4-year and whole follow-up data showed age, sex, HDL-C, LDL-C, and FBG were significantly associated with the risk of mortality, while BP and smoking were not significant predictors in all models. We incorporated age, sex, FBG, HDL-C, and LDL-C to establish risk scores for all-cause and cardiovascular mortality in the 4-year and whole follow-up study. These risk scores were positively associated with the risk of death as quartiles and continuous variables. Assessed by the area under the receiver operating characteristic curves (AUROCs), these risk scores demonstrated strong discriminatory capacity, from 0.744 to 0.763; and the utility of these scores was confirmed with AUROCs from 0.736 to 0.756 (all
