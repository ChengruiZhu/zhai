p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling has been implicated in the cancer development and progression. However, the precise mechanism of this association remains unknown. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the association between p38 and cancer progression, including investigations into the effects on cell proliferation, resistance to thalidomide, indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO) expression and prognosis in patients with esophageal cancer. The present retrospective study included patients with stage Iâ€“III esophageal cancer. A total of 228 patients with esophageal cancer were recruited to analyze the expression of phosphorylated (p)-p38 and IDO in tumor, and normal tissues through immunohistochemistry. Depression status was measured using the Zung Self-Rating Depression Scale. P38 cDNA was transfected into esophageal cancer cells to assess tumor cell viability, sensitivity to thalidomide treatment and IDO gene expression. Western blotting and flow cytometry was used to analyze protein expression alterations, and apoptosis in esophageal cancer cells. P-p38 protein was expressed in 68.9% of cancer tissues, and was significantly associated with depressive symptoms, tumor recurrence and poor survival of patients.
