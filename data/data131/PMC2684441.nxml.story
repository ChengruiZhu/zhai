Analysis of cellular 7,8-dihydro-8-oxo-2′-deoxyguanosine (8-oxo-dGuo) as a biomarker of oxidative DNA damage has been fraught with numerous methodological problems. This is primarily due to artifactual oxidation of dGuo that occurs during DNA isolation and hydrolysis. Therefore, it has become necessary to rely on using the comet assay, which is not necessarily specific for 8-oxo-dGuo. A highly specific and sensitive method based on immunoaffinity purification and stable isotope dilution liquid chromatography (LC)-multiple reaction monitoring (MRM)/mass spectrometry (MS) that avoids artifact formation has now been developed. Cellular DNA was isolated using cold DNAzol (a proprietary product that contains guanidine thiocyanate) instead of chaotropic- or phenol-based methodology. Chelex-treated buffers were used to prevent Fenton chemistry-mediated generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and artifactual oxidation of DNA bases. Deferoxamine was also added to all buffers in order to complex any residual transition metal ions remaining after Chelex treatment. The LC-MRM/MS method was used to determine that the basal 8-oxo-dGuo level in DNA from human bronchoalveolar H358 cells was 2.2 ± 0.4 8-oxo-dGuo/10
