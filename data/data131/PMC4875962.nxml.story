Edoxaban, a once daily non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulant, is a direct, selective, reversible inhibitor of factor Xa (FXa). In healthy subjects, single oral doses of edoxaban result in peak plasma concentrations within 1.0–2.0 h of administration, followed by a biphasic decline. Exposure is approximately dose proportional for once daily doses of 15–150 mg. Edoxaban is predominantly absorbed from the upper gastrointestinal tract, and oral bioavailability is approximately 62 %. Food does not affect total exposure to edoxaban. The terminal elimination half-life in healthy subjects ranges from 10 to 14 h, with minimal accumulation upon repeat once daily dosing up to doses of 120 mg. The steady-state volume of distribution is approximately 107 L, and total clearance is approximately 22 L/h; renal clearance accounts for approximately 50 % of total clearance, while metabolism and biliary secretion account for the remaining 50 %. Intrinsic factors, such as age, sex and race, do not affect edoxaban pharmacokinetics after renal function is taken into account. Oral administration of edoxaban results in rapid changes in anticoagulatory biomarkers, with peak effects on anticoagulation markers (such as anti-FXa), the prothrombin time and the activated partial thromboplastin time occurring within 1–2 h of dosing.
