 Anxiety is a common problem in dentistry which could affect the correct treatment and involve failure. Oral premedication is needed to treat several anxious patients. Many people are so highly anxious that oral sedation is not effective and need to be under deep sedation or even general anaesthesia in order to receive dental care. In these patients, due to a high level of anxiety, even the insertion of an intravenous catheter can be difficult. Benzodiazepines have been the most commonly used anxiolytic in these cases, but many may be associated with paradoxical reactions. Melatonin has a good potential to be used in this field as alternative to benzodiazepines because it may induce a natural sleepiness and improve sedation. The purpose of this paper was to summarize what is known about the use of melatonin in oral health and as dental premedication in anxious dental patients. Databases were searched for the relevant published literature to 30 April 2015. The following search items were used in various combinations: melatonin, premedication, anxiety, dental, sedation and anaesthesia. Few articles were found about this aspect, and the use of melatonin is still a controversial aspect in dental field. More detailed/specific studies are necessary to extend the therapeutic possibilities of melatonin as premedication in dentistry.
