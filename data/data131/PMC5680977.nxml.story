) for 24 to 72 h. Cell morphology was examined by light microscopy, and cell viability was checked by 3-[4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl]-5-[3-carboxymethoxypheny]-2-[4-sulfophenyl]-2H-tetrazolium (MTS). The expression of ERK1/2 and p38 MAPK, as well as their signaling-related molecules, was measured by Western blot and real-time polymerase chain (RT-PCR) reaction. At the 1% oxygen level, cell morphology had no appreciable changes compared to the control up to 72 h of exposure under light microscopy, whereas the results of MTS showed a slight but significant reduction in cell viability after 72 h of hypoxia. On the other hand, ERK1/2 and p38 phosphorylation remarkably increased in these cells after 24 to 72 h of hypoxia. In sharp contrast, the expression of transcription factor B-cell lymphoma 6 (Bcl-6) was significantly downregulated in response to hypoxic stress. Other intracellular molecules relevant to the ERK1/2 and p38 signaling pathway, such as protein kinase A, protein kinase C, Bcl-2, nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2, tristetraprolin, and interleukin-10(IL-10), had no significant alterations after 24 to 72 h of hypoxic exposure. We conclude that hypoxic stress increases the phosphorylation of both ERK1/2 and p38 but decreases the level of Bcl-6 in rat kidney epithelial cells.
