Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer death. As most of lung cancer patients were diagnosed with the advanced stage, early detection is considered as the most effective strategy to reduce high mortality. Thus, it is desirable to identify specific biomarkers at early stages of lung tumorigenesis. GPRC5A is a lung tumor suppressor gene. GPRC5A deficiency is linked to lung cancer development. We hyposthesized that, dysregulated gene expression that results from Gprc5a deficiency may provide potential biomarkers at early stages of lung tumorigenesis. By analysis of top 20 upregulated genes in mouse tracheal epithelial cells (MTEC) of Gprc5a knockout (KO) vs wild-type (WT), we found that ceruloplasmin, lipocalin-2, and periostin are not only upregulated in lung epithelial cells of Gprc5a-ko mice, but also expressed at high levels in lung tumor tissues of Gprc5a-ko mice. This suggests that increased expression of these genes is associated with lung tumorigenesis. Importantly, expression of ceruloplasmin, lipocalin-2, and periostin has also been found to be significantly increased, both at mRNA and protein levels, in the lung tissues from NSCLC patients, which is correlated with repressed GPRC5A. Thus, dysregulated ceruloplasmin, lipocalin-2, and periostin may be used as potential biomarkers at early stages of lung tumorigenesis.
