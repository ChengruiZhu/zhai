Animals differ in how they sense and process information obtained from the environment. An important part of this information processing is used to find food. In terms of foraging, local decision making determines how successful individuals are at finding food on longer timescales. Using an artificial-world model, we studied different kinds of decision making to understand how local information processing affects larger scale behavioral patterns and their evolution. We compared a restricted decision making (less memory) to extended decision making (more memory). We then compared the evolution of decision making and behavioral actions (moving and scanning for food) in patchy and uniform environments. Our results show that with restricted decision making individuals face a trade-off in the patchy environment: they try to stay in patches by not moving forward too far, but to do so they sacrifice how fast they travel between patches. With extended decision making this trade-off completely disappears because decision making allows moving forward to be avoided in patches. Instead moving forward can be used exclusively for faster traveling between patches and for selecting bigger patches. Our results show how changes in local decision making can significantly alter what evolutionary forces are faced and can eliminate evolutionary trade-offs.
