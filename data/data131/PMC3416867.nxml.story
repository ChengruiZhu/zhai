Chromatin packaging of eukaryotic genomes has wideranging, yet poorly understood, effects on gene regulation. Curiously, many histone modifications occur on the majority of genes, yet their loss typically affects a small subset of those genes. Here, we examine gene expression defects in 200 chromatin-related mutants during a stress response, finding that chromatin regulators have far greater effects on the dynamics of gene expression than on the steady-state transcription. By grouping mutants according to their shared defects in the stress response, we systematically recover known chromatin-related complexes and pathways, and predict several novel pathways. Finally, by integrating genome-wide changes in the locations of five prominent histone modifications during the stress response with our functional data, we uncover a novel role for the “activating” histone modification H3K4me3 in gene repression. Surprisingly, H3K4 methylation appears to act in conjunction with H3S10 phosphorylation in the repression of ribosomal biosynthesis genes. Repression of ribosomal protein genes and ribosomal RNA maturation genes occur via distinct pathways. Our results show that steady-state studies miss a great deal of important chromatin biology, and identify a surprising role for H3K4 methylation in ribosomal gene repression in yeast.
