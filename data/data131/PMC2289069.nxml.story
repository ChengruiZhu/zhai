The trafficking of lymphocytes from the blood and into lymphoid organs is controlled by tissue-selective lymphocyte interactions with specialized endothelial cells lining post capillary venules, in particular the high endothelial venules (HEV) found in lymphoid tissues and sites of chronic inflammation. Lymphocyte interactions with HEV are mediated in part by lymphocyte homing receptors and tissue-specific HEV determinants, the vascular addressins. A peripheral lymph node addressin (PNAd) has been detected immunohistologically in mouse and man by monoclonal antibody MECA-79, which inhibits lymphocyte homing to lymph nodes and lymphocyte binding to lymph node and tonsillar HEV. The human MECA-79 antigen, PNAd, is molecularly distinct from the 65-kD mucosal vascular addressin. The most abundant iodinated species by SDS- PAGE is 105 kD. When affinity isolated and immobilized on glass slides, MECA-79 immunoisolated material binds human and mouse lymphocytes avidly in a calcium dependent manner. Binding is blocked by mAb MECA- 79, by antibodies against mouse or human LECAM-1 (the peripheral lymph node homing receptor, the MEL-14 antigen, LAM-1), and by treatment of PNAd with neuraminidase. Expression of LECAM-1 cDNA confers PNAd binding ability on a transfected B cell line. We conclude that LECAM-1 mediates lymphocyte binding to PNAd, an interaction that involves the lectin activity of LECAM-1 and carbohydrate determinants on the addressin.
