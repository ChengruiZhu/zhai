Animal development is highly stereotypic in the face of changing environmental conditions and individual genetic differences. At the same time, developmental processes can evolve rapidly, suggesting that selectable genetic variation is hidden beneath this apparent stability. To better understand the relationship between these seemingly opposed properties of robustness and evolvability, we measured how natural variation in gene expression propagates across a network of interacting genes underlying early development in sea urchins. We found that gene interactions are not equal across development: expression variation is well buffered during early development by the use of on/off switch-like (rather than continuously tunable) regulatory mechanisms, while during later development it has a greater impact on the expression of downstream target genes and on morphology. Using a breeding design, we were able to detect a substantial genetic component to the observed variation in gene expression. Interestingly, the degree of genetic contribution was greatest during early development and specifically at points of switch-like regulation, suggesting that the properties of developmental gene regulatory networks that underlie robustness also promote the accumulation of genetic variation that could seed adaptation.
