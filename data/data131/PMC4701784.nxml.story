In nineteen patients (ten males), median age 68 years, 13 patients had entero-vesical fistulae, and 6 patients had entero-vaginal fistulae. The fistulae were caused by complicated diverticular disease in 16 patients (84 %), Crohn’s disease (two patients), and ulcerative colitis (one patient). All cases were attempted laparoscopically. Operative treatment involved separation of the inflammatory mass and resection of the affected colorectal segment. There were three conversions (16 %), all three requiring bladder repair considered too extensive for laparoscopic means. In two further patients small bladder defects were sutured laparoscopically, the remaining patients required no bladder repair. The inferior mesentric artery (IMA) was preserved in all cases. Median operative time was 180 min. Two patients received a protective ileostomy: one converted patient and one cachectic patient with Crohn’s disease under immune-modulating therapy. Both ileostomies were closed. Altogether, there were five complications in five patients (26 %), four of them were minor (Clavien grade I and II). The cachectic patient with Crohn’s disease suffered a major (grade IIIb) complication (stoma prolapse, treated by early closure of the ileostomy). There was no anastomotic leakage and no mortality. Median hospital stay was 12 days.
