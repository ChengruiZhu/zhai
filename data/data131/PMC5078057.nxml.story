Polymorphisms in TP53 are involved in the progression of different types of cancer. A rare novel TP53 variant (rs78378222 A > C allele) was found via whole-genome sequencing in 2011. This variant was shown to significantly increase the risk of glioma, colorectal adenoma and prostate cancer. Functional analysis further revealed that this variant hindered TP53 expression and its downstream effect on apoptosis. Several studies have investigated the relationship between rs78378222 and cancer susceptibility. However, the results were not consistent. We conducted the first meta-analysis to give a more credible assessment on the association about this variant and cancer risk. Our meta-analysis included 34 studies consisting of 36599 cases and 91272 controls. These studies were mostly on the basis of high-grade data from Genome-wide association studies (GWASs). The results indicated that TP53 rs78378222 was significantly associated with an increased risk of overall cancer (AC vs. AA: OR = 1.511, 95% CI = 1.285â€“1.777). Furthermore, stratified analyses indicated that rs78378222 increased the risk of nervous system cancer, skin cancer and other cancer. To summarize, this meta-analysis suggested that rs78378222 C allele is a potent risk factor for overall cancer.
