Reproductive isolation characterized by male sterility and decreased viability is important for speciation, because it suppresses free genetic exchange between two diverged populations and accelerates the genetic divergence. One of the reproductive isolation phenomena, hybrid sterility (sterility in hybrid animals), is possibly caused by deleterious interactions between diverged genetic factors brought by two distinct populations. The polymorphism not only in protein-coding sequences but also in transcriptional regulatory sequences can cause the genetic incompatibility in hybrid animals. However, the precise genetic mechanisms of hybrid sterility are mostly unknown. Here, we report that the expression of X-linked genes derived from one mouse subspecies was largely misregulated in the genetic background of another subspecies. The misregulated expression of the X-linked genes subsequently affected the global expression of autosomal genes. The results collectively indicate that hybrid sterility between the two mouse subspecies is caused by misregulation of gene expression due to genetic incompatibility in the transcriptional regulatory circuitry. Such genetic incompatibility in transcriptional regulation likely underlies reproductive isolation in general.
