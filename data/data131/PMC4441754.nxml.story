Three cycles to test the usability and feasibility were conducted. Each cycle included 11-19 unique participants ranging in age from 16 to 28 years. Following the testing period for each cycle, 15% to 25% of participants took part in the post-cycle interview. Participants perceived the final version of the diary as useful, easy to learn, and efficient to use. Psychometric properties were then tested with a sample of 65 participants (6 aged 14-17 years old; 59 aged 18-28 years old). All items in the diary had substantial between- and within-subjects variability (percent of variance for the two participant groups ranged from 20.64 to 75.60 and 23.74 to 79.21, respectively). Moreover, the Migraine Disability Assessment (MIDAS) included in the diary had adequate between-subjects reliability (R1F=0.66, RKF=0.98), but low within-subjects reliability (RC=0.51). Critical elements of the diary demonstrated adequate convergent and concurrent validity, particularly in the older age group (18-28 years). The validity of some critical elements of the diary could not be explored in the younger age group due to the small subgroup size. The case study provides an example of the potential utility of the diary.
