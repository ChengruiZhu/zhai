The molecular machinery of chromosome segregation during cell division is one of the most sophisticated molecular biology mechanisms employing the interplay of different proteins and forces. The long filamentous tube-shaped microtubule structure is a central player in chromosome segregation and cell division, making it an important physiological and therapeutic target. However, the driving force for microtubule disassembly and dynamic instability, and hence force generation, is still not fully understood. In our all-atom molecular dynamics simulations we calculated the energy of interactions, within a microtubule cylinder, that is responsible for microtubule stability. We broke this energy down to individual contributions of every residue and domain. Different energy profiles enabled us to unravel the driving force behind microtubule disassembly and force generation, a longstanding unanswered biological question. We also elucidated the mechanism of disassembly and explained the effects of different factors on disassembly rates. Our list of energetic contribution of single amino acid residues could also serve in tailor-designing engineered microtubules that could be used for therapeutic and diagnostic purposes.
