Multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) have seen increasing application in consumer products over the past decade, resulting in an increasing risk of human exposure. While numerous toxicological studies have been performed using acute high doses of various carbonaceous nanomaterials, the effects of longer-term, low doses of MWCNTs remain relatively unexplored. This study examined bronchoscopy-derived healthy human bronchial epithelial cells exposed in submerged culture to noncytotoxic doses of MWCNTs over 7 days. Under these conditions, doses as low as 3 μg/mL caused altered cell morphology, superficially resembling fibroblasts. Electrical impedance of the epithelial monolayer was greatly reduced following MWCNT exposure. However, Western blot and polymerase chain reaction showed no elevated expression of the fibroblast markers, vimentin, α-smooth muscle actin, or fibronectin, indicating that a mechanism other than epithelial–mesenchymal transition may be responsible for the changes. Phalloidin and tubulin immunostaining showed disruption of the cytoskeleton, and confocal imaging showed a reduction of the tight junction proteins, zona occludens 1 and occludin. We propose that MWCNTs interfere with the cytoskeleton of the lung epithelium, which can result in a harmful reduction in barrier function over time, even at noncytotoxic doses.
