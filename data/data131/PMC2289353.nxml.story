We have used an antibody against the ryanodine receptor/calcium release channel of skeletal muscle sarcoplasmic reticulum to localize a calcium release channel in sea urchin eggs. The calcium release channel is present in less than 20% of immature oocytes, where it does not demonstrate a specific cytoplasmic localization, while it is confined to the cortex of all mature eggs examined. This is in contrast to the cortical and subcortical localization of calsequestrin in mature and immature eggs. Immunolocalization of the calcium release channel reveals a cortical reticulum or honeycomb staining network that surrounds cortical granules and is associated with the plasma membrane. The network consists of some immunoreactive electron-dense material coating small vesicles and elongate cisternae of the endoplasmic reticulum. The fluorescent reticular staining pattern is lost when egg cortices are treated with agents known to affect sarcoplasmic reticulum calcium release and induce cortical granule exocytosis (ryanodine, calcium, A-23187, and caffeine). An approximately 380-kD protein of sea urchin egg cortices is identified by immunoblot analysis with the ryanodine receptor antibody. These results demonstrate: (a) the presence of a ryanodine-sensitive calcium release channel that is located within the sea urchin egg cortex; (b) an altered calcium release channel staining pattern as a result of treatments that initiate the cortical granule reaction; and (c) a spatial and functional dichotomy of the ER which may be important in serving different roles in the mobilization of calcium at fertilization.
