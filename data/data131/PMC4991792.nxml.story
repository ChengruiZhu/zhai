Ovules, being the progenitors of seeds, hold an important role in crop production. Ovule is a complex organ connecting two generations, i.e. diploid sporophytic cells and haploid female gametophytes (FG). Fertilization of female gametes leads to the development of embryo and endosperm while the sporophytic cells of ovules become seed coats. Because of its importance for plant reproduction, the development of ovules is tightly controlled. The integument cells are divided in a polar way so that integument cell layers fully enclose a mature FG, leaving an opening only for pollen tube entrance. The integuments also instruct FG development, synchronizing the two generations. Receptor-like kinases, especially STRUBBELIG (SUB), are crucial both for the establishment of ovular polarity and the intercellular communication between sporophytic and gametophytic cells. However, how SUB is post-translationally regulated, as would be expected for cell-surface proteins, is unclear. We report here that the dynamic trafficking of SUB via a subpopulation of endosomes is crucial for its functionality during ovule development. The membrane association of SUB was impaired when the recycling route from the
