The immune system reacts to the presence of a viral pathogen within the host by the elicitation of an immune response. This response is characterized by the activation and proliferation of specific cell types, which, for instance, produce neutralizing antibodies or kill cells infected by the virus. Cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) function as an important protecting element of the system by recognizing and clearing infected viral target cells. Surprisingly, estimates of the killing efficacy of CTLs vary about four orders of magnitude across experimental methods and viral systems. In some studies, CTL killing efficacies were estimated by employing pre-treated cells that mimick virus infected cells. In general, cells signal their infection by a pathogen to the immune system by presenting viral peptides on their cellular surface. For the experimentally pretreated cells, these peptides were artificially loaded onto the surface at very high densities. In this paper, we study to what extent the variation in peptide densities can explain the variation found in killing efficacy estimates across methods and viral systems. We found that peptide densities explain only up to two orders of magnitude in killing efficacy variation. The remaining variation must originate from other sources, which might be specific to the viral study system.
