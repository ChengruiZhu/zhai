 precursors of DC and monocytes are not attracted by MIP-3α. LCs lose the migratory responsiveness to MIP-3α during their maturation, and non-LC DCs do not acquire MIP-3α sensitivity. The notion that MIP-3α may be responsible for selective LC recruitment into the epidermis is further supported by the following observations: (a) MIP-3α is expressed by keratinocytes and venular endothelial cells in clinically normal appearing human skin; (b) LCs express CC chemokine receptor (CCR)6, the sole MIP-3α receptor both in situ and in vitro; and (c) non-LC DCs that are not found in normal epidermis lack CCR6. The mature forms of LCs and non-LC DCs display comparable sensitivity for MIP-3β, a CCR7 ligand, suggesting that DC subtype–specific chemokine responses are restricted to the committed precursor stage. Although LC precursors express primarily CCR6, non-LC DC precursors display a broad chemokine receptor repertoire. These findings reflect a scenario where the differential expression of chemokine receptors by two different subpopulations of DCs determines their functional behavior. One type, the LC, responds to MIP-3α and enters skin to screen the epidermis constitutively, whereas the other type, the “inflammatory” DC, migrates in response to a wide array of different chemokines and is involved in the amplification and modulation of the inflammatory tissue response.
