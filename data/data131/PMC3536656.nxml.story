Congenital disorders of sexual differentiation are rare diseases in which there is discordance between chromosomal, gonadal, and phenotypic sex. Unfortunately, only a minority of patients clinically diagnosed with disorders of sex development (DSD) obtains a molecular diagnosis, indicating that our understanding of the factors and signaling pathways mediating gonadal development and sex determination is far from complete. Using mouse models, we show that the insulin receptor (INSR) and the IGF type I receptor (IGF1R) are required to mediate different aspects of adrenogonadal development such as adrenal specification, testicular differentiation, and ovarian development. We found that a complex dynamic transcriptional program is initiated in somatic progenitor cells of the bipotential gonadal primordium prior to sex determination. A significant fraction of this genetic program is prematurely altered in the somatic progenitors lacking insulin/IGF signaling, which explains adrenal agenesis and the incapacity of XX and XY mutant gonads to develop into ovaries or testes. This finding sheds light on a crucial, but so far underestimated, signaling pathway underlying sex determination in mice and potentially DSDs in humans.
