The ability of mammals to navigate is well studied, both behaviourally and in terms on the underlying neurophysiology. Navigation is a well studied topic in computational fields such as machine learning and signal processing. However, studies in computational neuroscience, which draw together these findings, have mainly focused on specific navigation tasks such as spatial localisation. In this paper, we propose a single probabilistic model which can support multiple tasks, from working out which environment you are in, to computing a sequence of motor commands that will take you to a sensory goal, such as being warm or viewing a particular object. We describe how these tasks can be implemented using a common set of lower level algorithms that implement ‘forward and backward inference over time’. We relate these algorithms to recent findings in animal electrophysiology, where sequences of hippocampal cell activations are observed before, during or after a navigation task, and these sequences are played either forwards or backwards. Additionally, one function of the hippocampus that is preserved across mammals is that it integrates spatial and non-spatial information, and we propose how the forward and backward inference algorithms naturally map onto this architecture.
