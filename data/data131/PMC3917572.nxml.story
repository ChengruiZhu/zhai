The SVZ (subventricular zone) contains neural stem cells and progenitors of various potentialities. Although initially parsed into A, B, and C cells, this germinal zone is comprised of a significantly more diverse population of cells. Here, we characterized a subset of postnatal PRPs (PDGF-AA-responsive precursors) that express functional PDGFα and β receptors from birth to adulthood. When grown in PDGF-AA, dissociated neonatal rat SVZ cells divided to produce non-adherent clusters of progeny. Unlike the self-renewing EGF/FGF-2-responsive precursors that produce neurospheres, these PRPs failed to self-renew after three passages; therefore, we refer to the colonies they produce as spheroids. Upon differentiation these spheroids could produce neurons, type 1 astrocytes and oligodendrocytes. When maintained in medium supplemented with BMP-4 they also produced type 2 astrocytes. Using lineage tracing methods, it became evident that there were multiple types of PRPs, including a subset that could produce neurons, oligodendrocytes, and type 1 and type 2 astrocytes; thus some of these PRPs represent a unique population of precursors that are quatropotential. Spheroids also could be generated from the newborn neocortex and they had the same potentiality as those from the SVZ. By contrast, the adult neocortex produced less than 20% of the numbers of spheroids than the adult SVZ and spheroids from the adult neocortex only differentiated into glial cells. Interestingly, SVZ spheroid producing capacity diminished only slightly from birth to adulthood. Altogether these data demonstrate that there are PRPs that persist in the SVZ that includes a unique population of quatropotential PRPs.
