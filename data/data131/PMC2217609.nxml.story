Changes of 42K efflux (J23K) caused by ouabain and/or furosemide were measured in isolated epithelia of frog skin. From the kinetics of 42K influx (J32K) studied first over 8-9 h, K+ appeared to be distributed into readily and poorly exchangeable cellular pools of K+. The readily exchangeable pool of K+ was increased by amiloride and decreased by ouabain and/or K+-free extracellular Ringer solution. 42K efflux studies were carried out with tissues shortcircuited in chambers. Ouabain caused an immediate (less than 1 min) increase of the 42K efflux to approximately 174% of control in tissues incubated either in SO4-Ringer solution or in Cl-Ringer solution containing furosemide. Whereas furosemide had no effect on J23K in control tissues bathed in Cl-rich or Cl-free solutions, ouabain induced a furosemide-inhibitable and time-dependent increase of a neutral Cl-dependent component of the J23K. Electroconductive K+ transport occurred via a single-filing K+ channel with an n' of 2.9 K+ efflux before ouabain, normalized to post- ouabain (+/- furosemide) values of short-circuit current, averaged 8-10 microA/cm2. In agreement with the conclusions of the preceding article, the macroscopic stoichiometry of ouabain-inhibitable Na+/K+ exchange by the pump was variable, ranging between 1.7 and 7.2. With increasing rates of transepithelial Na+ transport, pump-mediated K+ influx saturated, whereas Na+ efflux continued to increase with increases of pump current. In the usual range of transepithelial Na+ transport, regulation of Na+ transport occurs via changes of pump-mediated Na+ efflux, with no obligatory coupling to pump-mediated K+ influx.
