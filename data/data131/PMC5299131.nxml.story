The present study investigated the prognostic factors predicting survival of patients with sepsis and acute kidney injury (AKI) undergoing continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT). This retrospective observational study included 165 sepsis patients treated with CRRT. The patients were divided into two groups; the survivor group (n=73, 44.2%) vs. the nonsurvivor group (n=92, 55.8%). AKI was defined by the 2012 Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes Clinical Practice Guidelines. We analyzed medical histories, clinical characteristics and laboratory findings of the enrolled patients when they started CRRT. In addition, we performed binary logistic regression and cox regression analysis. In the survivor group, urine output during the first day was significantly higher compared with the nonsurvivor group (55.7±66.3 vs. 26.6±46.4, p=0.001). Patients with urine output <30 mL/hour during the 1st day showed worse outcomes than ≥30 mL/hour in the logistic regression (hazard ratio 2.464, 95% confidence interval 1.152-5.271, p=0.020) and the cox regression analysis (hazard ratio 1.935, 95% confidence interval 1.147-3.263, p=0.013). In conclusion, urine output may predict survival of septic AKI patients undergoing CRRT. In these patients, urine output <30 mL/hour during the first day was the strongest risk factor for in-hospital mortality.
