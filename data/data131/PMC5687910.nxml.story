Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) in patients with Turner syndrome (TS) is an uncommon neuropsychiatric presentation that has not been well characterized in the scientific literature. Though no clear psychiatric component is syndromic to TS, the clinical manifestations of certain neuropsychiatric disorders, including mood, anxiety and eating disorders, have all been well documented in patients with TS. However, the presence of OCD in these patients has not been previously described. This report details a 19-year-old TS patient who presented with OCD since the age of 13, comorbid with several other psychiatric pathologies, including bipolar I disorder, anorexia nervosa and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). It will also discuss those comorbidities in relation to the patientâ€™s genetic syndrome and mention the contribution it makes to her multiple disabilities diagnosis as well as her patient-specific therapy. Patients with TS often present to treating physicians for overwhelming somatic complaints, likely resulting in poor recognition of psychiatric disorders. Thus, OCD may be significantly under-diagnosed in patients with TS and should be explored by clinicians treating this vulnerable population.
