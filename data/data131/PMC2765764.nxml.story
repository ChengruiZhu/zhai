Among Chinese immigrants, a higher proportion of care received from Chinese-speaking general practitioners (GPs) was associated with a lower probability of being diagnosed with neurotic disorders (OR = 0.87; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.80–0.95), drug dependence (OR = 0.22; 95% CI 0.14–0.35), adjustment reaction (OR = 0.39; 95% CI 0.33–0.46) and depressive disorder not elsewhere classified (OR = 0.47; 95% CI 0.42–0.52), as well as a lower rate of mental health service utilization (RR = 0.65%; 95% CI 0.61–0.69). Among the comparison group, a higher proportion of primary care received from Chinese-speaking GPs was associated with a lower probability of being diagnosed with affective psychoses (OR = 0.53; 95% CI 0.47–0.59), neurotic disorders (OR = 0.49; 95% CI 0.47–0.51), drug dependence (OR = 0.28; 95% CI 0.24–0.32), acute reaction to stress (OR = 0.54; 95% CI 0.51–0.57), adjustment reaction (OR = 0.36; 95% CI 0.33– 0.39), depressive disorder not elsewhere classified (OR = 0.30; 95% CI 0.29–0.32) and anxiety/depression (OR = 0.83; 95% CI 0.80–0.86), and with lower rates of mental health service utilization (RR = 0.32; 95% CI 0.30–0.33).
