Bone marrow-derived stem cells (BMDSCs) play an essential role in organ repair and regeneration. The molecular mechanisms by which hormones control BMDSCs proliferation and differentiation are unclear. Our aim in this study was to investigate how a lack of ovarian or/and thyroid hormones affects stem cell number in bone marrow lineage. To examine the effect of thyroid or/and ovarian hormones on the proliferative activity of BMDSCs, we removed the thyroid or/and the ovaries of adult female rats. An absence of ovarian and thyroid hormones was confirmed by Pap staining and Thyroid Stimulating Hormone (TSH) measurement, respectively. To obtain the stem cells from the bone marrow, we punctured the iliac crest, and aspirated and isolated cells by using a density gradient. Specific markers were used by cytometry to identify the different BMDSCs types: endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs), precursor B cells/pro-B cells, and mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs). Interestingly, our results showed that hypothyroidism caused a significant increase in the percentage of EPCs, whereas a lack of ovarian hormones significantly increased the precursor B cells/pro-B cells. Moreover, the removal of both glands led to increased MSCs. In conclusion, both ovarian and thyroid hormones appear to have key and diverse roles in regulating the proliferation of cells populations of the bone marrow.
