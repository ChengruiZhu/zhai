Imagine driving a car when you hear the sentence, “Take the next left.” Immediately, auditory “left” neurons begin to fire. But to use this information a few seconds later when you reach the junction, these neurons should persist in their firing after the auditory stimulus has been removed. This persistent activity, believed to be the basis for working memory, is maintained by a recurrent neural network in memory-related cortical areas. Previous studies showed that a network can maintain memories of “which” stimulus was observed. It has recently been shown that synapses between excitatory cells in the prefrontal cortex, where persistent activity is often observed, exhibit activity-dependent dynamics. Different forms of synaptic dynamics such as depression and facilitation were observed. In this work, we use a mathematical model of a recurrent neural network to analyze the effect of introducing dynamic synapses in the context of persistent activity. We find that the initiation of persistent firing can depend on the duration of the input. These results open the possibility that recurrent neural networks can encode not only “which” stimulus was observed, but also for “how long.”
