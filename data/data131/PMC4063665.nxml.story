Understanding complex biological systems, especially at intracellular scales, has always been a big challenge, owing to the difficulties in measuring and manipulating such small quantities. Computational modeling brings promising possibilities to this area. The model organism we have studied here is the diatom, a single cellular silicifying organism. Diatoms live in most water habitats and they use the very low concentrations of silicon in the oceans to develop beautifully complex silica structures. The cell control strategies acting on this process have been a long-standing open question. In this work, we have modeled the silicon uptake, transport and synthesis in diatoms in different cell compartments. To find the best set of free parameters of the model we solved the inverse problem using parameter identifiability, global optimization, sensitivity and perturbation techniques. The resulting model is a framework for manipulating and testing different properties of cells; for example, we have tested the cell control on silicon uptake by changing the expression level of the transporter proteins. Such modeling, described in this work, is both a necessary and important tool for understanding the cell strategies over control of material transport and synthesis.
