Invariant chain (Ii), which associates with major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II molecules in the endoplasmic reticulum, contains a targeting signal for transport to intracellular vesicles in the endocytic pathway. The characteristics of the target vesicles and the relationship between Ii structure and class II localization in distinct endosomal subcompartments have not been well defined. We demonstrate here that in transiently transfected COS cells expressing high levels of the p31 or p41 forms of Ii, uncleaved Ii is transported to and accumulates in transferrin-accessible (early) endosomes. Coexpressed MHC class II is also found in this same compartment. These early endosomes show altered morphology and a slower rate of content movement to later parts of the endocytic pathway. At more moderate levels of Ii expression, or after removal of a highly conserved region in the cytoplasmic tail of Ii, coexpressed class II molecules are found primarily in vesicles with the characteristics of late endosomes/prelysosomes. The Ii chains in these late endocytic vesicles have undergone proteolytic cleavage in the lumenal region postulated to control MHC class II peptide binding. These data indicate that the association of class II with Ii results in initial movement to early endosomes. At high levels of Ii expression, egress to later endocytic compartments is delayed and class II-Ii complexes accumulate together with endocytosed material. At lower levels of Ii expression, class II- Ii complexes are found primarily in late endosomes/prelysosomes. These data provide evidence that the route of class II transport to the site of antigen processing and loading involves movement through early endosomes to late endosomes/prelysosomes. Our results also reveal an unexpected ability of intact Ii to modify the structure and function of the early endosomal compartment, which may play a role in regulating this processing pathway.
