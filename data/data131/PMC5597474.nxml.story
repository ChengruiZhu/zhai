There were 100 unlinked infections in couples followed for a median of 806 days. Forty-five infections occurred in women [1.85/100 couple-years; 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.35 to 2.47]. Risk of female unlinked infection (vs. nonseroconverting females) was associated with reporting being drunk weekly/daily vs. moderate/nondrinkers at baseline [adjusted hazard ratio (aHR) = 5.44; 95% CI: 1.03 to 28.73], genital ulcers (aHR = 6.09; 95% CI: 2.72 to 13.64), or genital inflammation (aHR = 11.92; 95% CI: 5.60 to 25.37) during follow-up adjusting for age, years cohabiting, income, contraceptive use, previous pregnancies, history of sexually transmitted infections, and condomless sex with study partner. Fifty-five infections occurred in men (1.82/100 couple-years; 95% CI: 1.37 to 2.37). Risk of male unlinked infection was associated with genital inflammation (aHR = 8.52; 95% CI: 3.82 to 19.03) or genital ulceration (aHR = 2.31; 95% CI: 2.05 to 8.89), reporting â‰¥1 outside sexual partner (aHR = 3.86; 95% CI: 0.98 to 15.17) during follow-up, and reporting being drunk weekly/daily vs. moderate/nondrinkers at baseline (aHR = 3.84; 95% CI: 1.28 to 11.55), controlling for age, income, circumcision status, and history of sexually transmitted infection.
