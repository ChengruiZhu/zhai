The diversity of medical factors makes the analysis and judgment of uncertainty one of the challenges of medical diagnosis. A well-designed classification and judgment system for medical uncertainty can increase the rate of correct medical diagnosis. In this paper, a new multidimensional classifier is proposed by using an intelligent algorithm, which is the general fuzzy cerebellar model neural network (GFCMNN). To obtain more information about uncertainty, an intuitionistic fuzzy linguistic term is employed to describe medical features. The solution of classification is obtained by a similarity measurement. The advantages of the novel classifier proposed here are drawn out by comparing the same medical example under the methods of intuitionistic fuzzy sets (IFSs) and intuitionistic fuzzy cross-entropy (IFCE) with different score functions. Cross verification experiments are also taken to further test the classification ability of the GFCMNN multidimensional classifier. All of these experimental results show the effectiveness of the proposed GFCMNN multidimensional classifier and point out that it can assist in supporting for correct medical diagnoses associated with multiple categories.
