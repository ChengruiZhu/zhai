The Amplatzer Cardiac Plug (ACP) is one of the most commonly used devices for percutaneous left atrial appendage (LAA) closure in order to prevent a stroke in patients with atrial fibrillation and contraindication for long-term oral anticoagulation therapy. We have previously described a patient who had experienced an embolization of the ACP device about 12 months after implantation and the device could be percutaneously retrieved. A few years later, he suffered from a posterior stroke and a stroke located in the brainstem as well as a transischemic attack (TIA). In order to protect him from further cardioembolic events a reocclusion of the LAA with the new generation of ACP device, the Amplatzer Amulet, was performed. A stable position of the device within follow-up period could be confirmed and the patient was free of additional strokes/TIA or bleeding events. This case stresses the importance of proper LAA sizing in order to prevent device embolization and notes that LAA size is not static. Moreover, it demonstrates that repeated implantation of an LAA occlusion device was still possible; one should be aware of undersizing the LAA dimensions and that the modifications of new generation LAA occlusion devices may overcome limitations of first-generation devices in order to prevent a cardioembolic stroke.
