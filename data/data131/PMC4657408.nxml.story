Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is a common microvascular complication caused by diabetes mellitus (DM) and is a leading cause of vision impairment and loss among adults. Here, we performed a comprehensive proteomic analysis to discover biomarkers for DR. First, to identify biomarker candidates that are specifically expressed in human vitreous, we performed data-mining on both previously published DR-related studies and our experimental data; 96 proteins were then selected. To confirm and validate the selected biomarker candidates, candidates were selected, confirmed, and validated using plasma from diabetic patients without DR (No DR) and diabetics with mild or moderate nonproliferative diabetic retinopathy (Mi or Mo NPDR) using semiquantitative multiple reaction monitoring (SQ-MRM) and stable-isotope dilution multiple reaction monitoring (SID-MRM). Additionally, we performed a multiplex assay using 15 biomarker candidates identified in the SID-MRM analysis, which resulted in merged AUC values of 0.99 (No DR versus Mo NPDR) and 0.93 (No DR versus Mi and Mo NPDR). Although further validation with a larger sample size is needed, the 4-protein marker panel (APO4, C7, CLU, and ITIH2) could represent a useful multibiomarker model for detecting the early stages of DR.
