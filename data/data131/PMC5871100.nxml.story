Conflicting results to identify the relationship between tooth loss and cancer risk. Therefore, a dose-response meta-analysis was performed to clarify and quantitative assessed the correlation between tooth loss and cancer risk. Up to March 2017, 25 observational epidemiological studies were included in current meta-analysis. Tooth loss was significantly associated with a higher risk of cancer. Additionally, tooth loss was associated with significantly a higher risk of esophageal cancer, gastric cancer, head and neck cancer, colorectal cancer, pancreas cancer, lung cancer, prostate cancer, bladder cancer and hematopoietic cancer. Subgroup analysis showed consistent findings. Furthermore, a significant dose-response relationship was observed between tooth loss and cancer risk. Increasing per 10 of tooth loss was associated with a 9% increment of cancer risk, 14% increment of esophageal cancer risk, 9% increment of gastric cancer risk, 31% increment of head and neck cancer risk, 4% increment of colorectal cancer risk, 7% increment of pancreas cancer risk, 19% increment of lung cancer risk, 2% increment of bladder cancer risk and 3% increment of hematopoietic cancer risk. Considering these promising results, tooth loss might be harmful for health. Large sample size, different ethnic population and different cancer type are warranted to validate this association.
