The trauma group differed significantly from the non-trauma group in the measured angle of the tibial tunnel in the ap radiograph (trauma group 28.4°, non-trauma group 22.67°; p = 0.013). The Hamstring group differed significantly from the BTB group in the measured inclination angle of the femoral tunnel in the ap radiograph (HS group 54.86°, BTB group 62.78°; p = 0.015). There was also a significant difference concerning the tibial tunnel in the ap radiograph (HS group 29.56°, BTB group 21.63°; p = 0.0001). Comparing the two groups for the femoral tunnel placement-techniques we could find significant differences in the femoral ap-radiographs (inclination angle: TT = 59.04°, AM = 45.64°; p = 0.0001). The analysis of the 4 subgroups revealed differences in the tibial ap images: The BTB trauma group had an average of 23.56° relative to the BTB non-trauma group of 16.91° (p=0.013). The HS groups among themselves did not differ significantly, but the HS non-trauma group had a significantly higher angle with 29.38° to 16.91° in the BTB non-trauma group (p = 0.0003). In addition there was a significant difference when comparing the transtibial trauma group with the transtibial non trauma group (TT trauma = 27.66°, TT non trauma = 21.15°; p = 0.017)
