The purpose of this study is to investigate the interplay effect between dynamic MLC movement and tumor respiratory motion in volumetric‐modulated arc therapy (VMAT)‐based lung SBRT treatment delivered by the flattening filter‐free (FFF) beam of a Varian TrueBeam machine. Six lung cancer patients with tumor motions ranging between 0.5–1.6 cm were recruited in this study. All patients underwent 4D‐CT scan with audiocoaching. A two‐arc VMAT plan was retrospectively generated using Varian's Eclipse planning system for each patient. To explicitly describe the interplay effect, the contributions of each control point in the original static VMAT plans to each respiratory phase were calculated, and then ten new VMAT plans corresponding to different respiratory phases were generated and imported back into Eclipse planning system to calculate the radiation dose based on the CT images of related respiratory phase. An in‐house 4D dose calculation program with deformable registration capacity was used to calculate the accumulative 4D dose distribution of the targets. For all patients, the PTV coverage dropped significantly with increased respiratory motion amplitude. However, V100 and D90 of the GTV and
