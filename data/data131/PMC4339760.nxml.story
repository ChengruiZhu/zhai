 During 11.6 million person-years of follow-up, 114 859 people had an initial non-fatal or fatal CVD presentation. By age 90 years, current vs never smokers’ lifetime risks varied from 0.4% vs 0.2% for subarachnoid haemorrhage (SAH), to 8.9% vs 2.6% for peripheral arterial disease (PAD). Current smoking showed no association with cardiac arrest or sudden cardiac death [hazard ratio (HR) = 1.04, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.91–1.19).The strength of association differed markedly according to disease type: stable angina (HR = 1.08, 95% CI 1.01–1.15),transient ischaemic attack (HR = 1.41, 95% CI 1.28-1.55), unstable angina (HR = 1.54, 95% CI 1.38–1.72), intracerebral haemorrhage (HR = 1.61, 95% CI 1.37–1.89), heart failure (HR = 1.62, 95% CI 1.47–1.79), ischaemic stroke (HR = 1.90, 95% CI 1.72–2.10), MI (HR = 2.32, 95% CI 2.20–2.45), SAH (HR = 2.70, 95% CI 2.27–3.21), PAD (HR = 5.16, 95% CI 4.80–5.54) and abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) (HR = 5.18, 95% CI 4.61–5.82). Population-attributable fractions were lower for women than men for unheralded coronary death, ischaemic stroke, PAD and AAA. Ten years after quitting smoking, the risks of PAD, AAA (in men) and unheralded coronary death remained increased (HR = 1.36, 1.47 and 2.74, respectively).
