 mutant cancers. However, as with other targeted agents, treatment with PARP inhibitors generates acquired resistance within these tumors. The mechanism of this acquired resistance is poorly understood. We established cell lines that are resistant to PARP inhibitor by continuous treatment with the drug, and then used RNA sequencing to compare gene expression. Pathway analysis on the RNA sequencing data indicates that NF-κB signaling is preferentially up-regulated in PARP inhibitor-resistant cells, and that knockdown of core components in NF-κB signaling reverses the sensitivity to PARP inhibitor in resistant cells. Of therapeutic relevance, we show that PARP inhibitor-resistant cells are sensitive to an NF-κB inhibitor in comparison to their parental controls. Malignancies with up-regulation of NF-κB are sensitive to bortezomib, a proteasome inhibitor that is currently used in the clinic. We also show that treatment with bortezomib results in cell death in the PARP inhibitor-resistant cells, but not in parental cells. Therefore we propose that up-regulation of NF-κB signaling is a key mechanism underlying acquired resistance to PARP inhibition, and that NF-κB inhibition, or bortezomib are potentially effective anti-cancer agents after the acquisition of resistance to PARP inhibitors.
