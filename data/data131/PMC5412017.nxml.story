Neonatal periostin-knockout mice and their wildtype littermates were subjected to MI or sham surgery. In the wildtype mice after MI, fibrosis was detectable at 3 days and fibrotic tissue was completely replaced by regenerated myocardium at 21 days. In contrast, in the knockout mice, significant fibrosis in the infarcted area was present at even 3 weeks after MI. Levels of phosphorylated-histone 3 and aurora B in the myocardium, detected by immunofluorescence and western blotting, were significantly lower in knockout than in wildtype mice at 7 days after MI. Similarly, angiogenesis was decreased in the knockout mice after MI. Expression of both the endothelial marker CD-31 and α-smooth muscle actin was markedly lower in the knockout than in wildtype mice at 7 days after MI. The knockout MI group had elevated levels of glycogen synthase kinase (GSK) 3β and decreased phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K), phosphorylated serine/threonine protein kinase B (p-Akt), and cyclin D1, compared with the wildtype MI group. Similar effects were observed in experiments using cultured cardiomyocytes from neonatal wildtype or periostin knockout mice. Administration of SB216763, a GSK3β inhibitor, to knockout neonatal mice decreased myocardial fibrosis and increased angiogenesis in the infarcted area after MI.
