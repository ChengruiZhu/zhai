The ability of bacteria to evolve and adapt to new environments most often results from the acquisition of new genes by horizontal transfer. Plasmids have a preponderant role in gene exchanges through their ability to transfer DNA by conjugation, a process that transports DNA between bacteria. Besides, plasmids are autonomous DNA molecules that are faithfully transmitted to cell progeny during vegetative cell multiplication. In this study, we report a system composed of two proteins, StbA and StbB, which act to balance plasmid R388 physiology between two modes: a maintenance mode (vertical transmission) and a propagation mode (horizontal transmission). We demonstrate that StbA is essential to ensure faithful assortment of plasmid copies to daughter cells. In turn, StbB is required for plasmid R388 adequate localization for conjugation. This is the first report of a system which reconciles plasmid segregation and conjugation. Furthermore, R388 belongs to the IncW family of conjugative plasmids, which are of particular interest due to their exceptionally broad host range. We show that the StbAB system is conserved among a wide variety of conjugative plasmids, mainly broad host range plasmids. Thus, the Stb system could constitute an interesting therapeutic target to prevent the spread of adaptive genes.
