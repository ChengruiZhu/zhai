We investigated whether β-adrenergic antagonists attenuates dietary fat absorption through the regulation of pancreatic lipase (PNLIP) expression in pancreatic acinar cells in the context of high fat diet feeding. Male six-week-old C57BL/6 mice were assigned into an ad libitum fed control diet (CON) and a high fat diet (HIGH). Within each diet group, subgroups of mice were treated with vehicle (VEH) or propranolol, a β-adrenergic antagonist (BB). Over 12 weeks, body weight gain observed in HIGHVEH was mitigated in HIGHBB (+103% vs. +72%). Increase in fecal fat amount observed in HIGHVEH was further increased in HIGHBB. Increase in PNLIP expressions observed in HIGHVEH pancreatic tissues was abolished in HIGHBB. PNLIP expression in mouse primary pancreatic acinar cells and 266-6 cell lines increased with isoproterenol treatment, which was blocked by propranolol. Isoproterenol increased PNLIP expression in a cAMP/protein kinase A/ cyclic AMP response element binding protein (CREB)-dependent manner. CREB directly bound to the CRE on the mouse PNLIP promoter and transactivated PNLIP expression. These results suggest that sympathetic activation increases dietary fat absorption through the upregulation of PNLIP expression and that a β-adrenergic antagonist attenuates obesity development partly through the downregulation of PNLIP expression and inhibition of dietary fat absorption in the context of high fat diet feeding.
