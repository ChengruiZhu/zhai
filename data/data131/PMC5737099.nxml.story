From 1990 to 2015, the prevalence of all glaucoma ranged from 2.59% (95% CI = 1.96–3.49) to 2.58% (95% CI = 1.94–3.47). For different subtypes of glaucoma, the overall prevalence of POAG ranged from 1.03% (95% CI = 0.67–1.58) in 1990 to 1.02% (95% CI = 0.67–1.57) in 2015, PACG from 1.41% (95% CI = 1.18–1.68) to 1.40% (95% CI = 1.17–1.68). The overall prevalence of secondary glaucoma was 0.15% (95% CI = 0.10–0.23) during this period. The number of people with all glaucoma in China was 5.92 million (95% CI = 4.47–7.97) in 1990, and 13.12 million (95% CI = 9.88–17.68) in 2015. This increasing trend was also witnessed in different subtypes of glaucoma. The number of people affected by POAG increased from 2.35 million (95% CI = 1.54–3.60) in 1990 to 5.22 million (95% CI = 3.40–7.98) in 2015, PACG from 3.22 million (95% CI = 2.70–3.84) to 7.14 million (95% CI = 5.97–8.53), and secondary glaucoma from 0.34 million (95% CI = 0.23–0.53) to 0.76 million (95% CI = 0.51–1.17). In 2015, more than half (54.42%) of the glaucoma cases were PACG, followed by POAG (39.79%) and secondary glaucoma (5.79%). By 2050, the number of all glaucoma cases in China will be 25.16 million (95% CI = 18.96–33.86). In the multivariable meta–regressions, the odds ratio (OR) for each decade’s increase in age was 1.43 (95% CI = 1.33–1.55) for POAG, and 1.65 (95% CI = 1.51–1.80) for PACG; males were more likely to have POAG (OR 1.36, 95% CI = 1.17–1.59), but less likely to have PACG (OR 0.53, 95% CI = 0.46–0.60) compared with females. After adjustment of age and gender, people living in urban areas were more likely to have POAG compared with those in rural areas (OR 1.54, 95% CI = 1.02–2.35). People in Northeast China were at a higher risk (OR 1.77, 95% CI = 1.07–2.94) of having PACG than people in East China. Among the six regions, East China owed the most POAG and PACG cases, whereas Northwest China owed the least.
