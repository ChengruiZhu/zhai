In the time it takes you to read this paragraph, one person will have undergone a lower limb amputation due to diabetic foot disease. With the global diabetes population on the rise and set to reach 330 million by 2025, the need for research into therapies and technologies that have the potential to prevent amputation is dire. There is much debate about the best way to treat these wounds, and one treatment that is shrouded with controversy is Hyperbaric Oxygen Therapy (HBOT). There are currently no conclusive data showing that HBOT can assist chronic wound healing, but there has been some clinical success. In light of how expensive properly designed clinical trials can be, we must turn to alternative methods of assessment, such as the theoretical model presented here. The mathematical model reproduces a number of clinical observations. A key result is that while HBOT can assist chronic diabetic wounds, it holds little benefit for wounds that would heal of their own accord. This model represents a useful tool to analyse the optimal protocol, and the results and insights gained from the model may be used to improve both the success rate and thus the cost-effectiveness of this therapy.
