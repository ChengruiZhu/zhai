 study, patient cohort data, and the cBioPortal for Cancer Genomics and Kaplan-Meier Plotter websites. Experiments using T47D and ZR75-1 demonstrated AR-overexpressing cell lines decreased in cell proliferation through downregulation of ER, but FOXA1 did not change. Knockdown of FOXA1 resulted in a significantly reduced cell viability. Patients with immunohistochemically AR(-)/FOXA1(-) tumor frequently showed node metastasis, high grade, and high Ki-67 proliferation, therefore, significantly worse survival in ER-positive disease. AR and FOXA1 mRNA levels were significantly higher in ER-positive than in ER-negative tumors and AR-low/FOXA1-low tumors showed high grade, frequent basal-like subtype and worse disease-free survival in ER-positive cancers of public gene dataset, similarly to patient cohort results. The Kaplan-Meier Plotter analysis independently validated patients with both low AR/FOXA1 tumor were significantly associated with worse relapse-free survival in ER-positive cancers. This study suggests that distinctive clinicopathological features according to AR and FOXA1 are determined and a lack of both biomarkers is an independent poor prognostic factor in ER-positive tumors.
