-acetylcysteine (NAC) on human gingival fibroblasts (HGFs) under oxidative stress induced by hydrogen peroxide. Real-time cytotoxicity analyses reveals that resveratrol and quercetin enhanced cell proliferation even under oxidative stress. Of the antioxidants tested, resveratrol is the most effective at inhibiting ROS production. HGFs incubated with resveratrol and quercetin up-regulate the transcription of type I collagen gene after 3 h, but only resveratrol sustained this up-regulation for 24 h. A measurement of the oxygen consumption rate (OCR, mitochondrial respiration) shows that resveratrol generates the highest maximal respiratory capacity, followed by quercetin and NAC. Simultaneous measurement of OCR and the extracellular acidification rate (non-mitochondrial respiration) reveals that resveratrol and quercetin induce an increase in mitochondrial respiration when compared with untreated cells. NAC treatment consumes less oxygen and enhances more non-mitochondrial respiration. In conclusion, resveratrol is the most effective antioxidant in terms of real-time cytotoxicity analysis, reduction of ROS production, and enhancement of type I collagen synthesis and mitochondrial respiration in HGFs.
