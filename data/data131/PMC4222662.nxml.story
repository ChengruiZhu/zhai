In humans, telomerase is expressed in the germline and stem, but is repressed in somatic cells, which limits replicative lifespan of the latter. To unleash cell proliferation, telomerase is reactivated in most human cancers, but some cancer cells employ alternative lengthening of telomeres (ALT) based on homologous recombination (HR) to escape senescence. Recombination-based telomere maintenance similar to ALT was originally discovered in budding yeast deficient in telomerase activity. Two types of telomere arrangement that depend on two genetically distinct HR pathways (RAD51- and RAD59-dependent) were identified in post-senescent survivors, but the transition to telomere maintenance by HR is poorly understood. Here, we show that one of the earliest steps of short telomere rearrangement in telomerase-negative yeast is directly related to the “short telomere rescue pathway” proposed 20 years ago by Lundblad and Blackburn, which culminates in the acquisition of subtelomeric Y′ element by shortened telomere. We found that this telomere rearrangement depends on Rad52 strand annealing activity stimulated by Rad59, thus it is distinct from Rad51-dependent Y′ amplification process observed in type I survivors. We show that continuous repair of critically short telomeres in telomerase-negative cells delays the onset of senescence and prepares the ground for telomere maintenance by HR.
