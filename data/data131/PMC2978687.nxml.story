Completion of DNA replication is essential for cellular survival. Both endogenous processes and exogenous DNA damage can lead to lesions that impede DNA replication or result in an accumulation of DNA gaps. Recombination plays an important role in facilitating replication completion under conditions of replication stress or DNA damage. One DNA damage tolerance mechanism involving recombination factors, template switch, uses the information on the newly synthesized sister chromatid to fill in the gaps arising during replication under damaging conditions. This process leads to the formation of repair structures involving sister chromatid junctions in the proximity of replication forks. The template switch structures can be detected by 2D gel electrophoresis of replication intermediates as cruciform, X-shaped intermediates. Additional factors and regulatory pathways are required for the resolution of such structures to prevent their toxic effects. In this work, we have dissected the recombination/replication factors required for the formation of template switch intermediates. Another recombination mechanism, which has been implicated in the restart of collapsed forks, is break-induced replication (BIR). This study allows us to identify the core factors required for template switch and to distinguish this process from other recombination-mediated processes promoting DNA repair.
