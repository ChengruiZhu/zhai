We are always learning regularities in the world around us: where things are, and in what order we might find them. Our knowledge of these contingencies can be relied upon if we later want to use them to make decisions. However, there is little agreement about the neurobiological mechanism by which learned contingencies are deployed for decision making. These are different kinds of decisions than simple habits, in which we take actions that have in the past given us reward. Neural mechanisms of habitual decisions are well-described by computational reinforcement learning approaches, but have not often been applied to ‘model-based’ decisions that depend on learned contingencies. In this article, we apply reinforcement learning to investigate model-based decisions. We tested participants on a serial reaction time task with changing sequential contingencies, and choice probes that depend on these contingencies. Fitting computational models to reaction times, we show that two sets of predictions drive simple response behavior, only one of which is used to make choices. Using fMRI, we observed learning and decision-related activity in hippocampal and ventral cortical areas that is computationally linked to the learned contingencies used to make choices. These results suggest a critical role for a hippocampal-cortical network in model-based decisions for reward.
