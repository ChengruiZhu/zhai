 The injection of thioglycollate medium into the peritoneal cavity of the mouse induces high levels of macrophage fibrinolytic activity due to the production and secretion of a plasminogen activator, a trypsinlike serine protease, which is absent in unstimulated macrophages. Intraperitoneal injection of endotoxin or mineral oil can stimulate only a fraction (<10%) of the fibrinolytic activity of thioglycollate cells, similar to the partial stimulation (<10%) seen 1â€“2 days after phagocytosis of latex or SRBC by unstimulated macrophages. The endotoxin-stimulated macrophages contain and release relatively low levels of plasminogen activator, but these primed cells can be triggered to produce and secrete high levels of enzyme, by phagocytosis of latex. Under conditions where the plasminogen activator is induced and secreted, there are no effects on the production and/or release of lysozyme or intracellular acid hydrolases, Discovery of a two-stage procedure for inducing macrophage plasminogen activator made it possible to study the role of cell priming and phagocytosis separately. Endotoxin was a more effective priming agent, weight for weight, than lipid A:BSA complex. Secretion of the plasminogen activator was induced only by thioglycollate, or endotoxin and latex. In situ fibrinolysis was induced by these agents and mineral oil, BCG, and fetal calf serum, in decreasing order of effectiveness. Phagocytosis of latex in all cases except thioglycollate stimulation, increased fibrinolytic activity from three- to sixfold. Latex and a variety of other particles such as
