The developmental separation of ON and OFF pathways is one of the fundamental features of the visual system. In the mouse retina, some bi-stratified ON-OFF RGCs are refined into mono-stratified ON or OFF RGCs during the first postnatal month. However, the process by which the RGCs' physiological receptive field properties mature remains incompletely characterized, mainly due to the lack of a reliable and efficient method to classify RGCs into different subtypes. Here we have developed an innovative analysis, Spike Triggered Covariance â€“ Non-Centered (STC-NC), and demonstrated that this technique can accurately characterize the receptive field properties of ON, OFF and ON-OFF center cells. We show that, in wildtype mouse, RGCs gradually develop sensitivity to focal stimulation after eye opening, and the development of ON-OFF receptive field center properties correlates well with their dendritic laminar refinement. Furthermore, overexpression of NT-3 accelerates the developmental decrease of receptive field center size in ON-OFF cells. Our study is the first to establish the STC-NC analysis which can successfully identify ON-OFF subtype RGCs and to demonstrate how receptive field development relates to a neurotrophic driver in the retina.
