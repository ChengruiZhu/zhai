Sepsis occurs when a patient develops a whole body immune response due to infection. In this condition, white blood cells called neutrophils circulate in an active state, seeking and eliminating invading bacteria. However, when neutrophils are activated, healthy tissue is inadvertently targeted, leading to organ damage and potentially death. Even though sepsis kills millions worldwide, there are still no specific treatments approved in the United States. This may be due to the complexity and diversity of the bodyâ€™s immune response, which can be managed well using computational modeling. We have developed a computational model to predict how different levels of neutrophil activation impact survival in an overactive inflammatory conditions. The model was utilized to assess the effectiveness of a simulated experimental sepsis treatment which modulates neutrophil populations and activity. This evaluation determined that treatment timing plays a critical role in therapeutic effectiveness. When utilized properly the treatment drastically improves survival, but there is also risk of causing patient harm when introduced at the wrong time. We intend for this computational model to support and guide further development of sepsis treatments and help translate these preliminary results from bench to bedside.
