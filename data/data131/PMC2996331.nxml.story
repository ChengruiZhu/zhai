The simultaneous analysis of gene expression in cancer using microarrays is a standard approach for monitoring disease-related modifications involved in tumorigenesis, triggering malignant properties and clinical behavior. However, the factors that drive these alterations most often remain elusive. We sought to identify transcription factors that mediate the transcriptional effects of the receptor tyrosine kinase/RAS oncoprotein pathway, a frequently activated oncogenic signaling system, in cultured colorectal cancer cells. We used an integrated approach combining molecular and functional assays, as well as computational tools, to identify regulatory factors that trigger the alterations of gene expression and modulate cellular growth. We identified the YBX1 protein, a member of the highly conserved family of cold shock domain transcription factors, as a regulator of signaling effects triggered by the RAS cancer gene. Then we assayed the messenger RNA expression of YBX1 and YBX1-responsive target genes by interrogating microarrays, and also expression of the YBX1 protein by immunohistochemistry in colorectal tumors. We found that YBX1 expression is correlated with a bad clinical outcome in colon cancer patients.
