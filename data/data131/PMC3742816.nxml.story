The present study aimed to investigate the correlation between the expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and its receptors, the Flt-1 and KDR proteins, with clinical pathology and microvessel density (MVD) in ovarian cancer tissue. The protein expression levels of VEGF and its receptors, Flt-1 and KDR/Flk-1, were detected in 48 cases of ovarian cancer using the streptavidin-biotin complex (SABC) immunohistochemical method, and tumor MVD was evaluated using F8 factor (FVIII-RA). The expression of the VEGF, Flt-1 and KDR proteins was not significantly associated with the pathological type, extent of differentiation or clinical stage of ovarian cancer. However, the co-expression of VEGF and Flt-1 was markedly correlated with differentiation and clinical stage (P<0.01). The co-expression levels of VEGF and receptor Flt-1 in malignant neoplasms with lymph node metastasis was significantly higher compared with malignant neoplasms without lymph node metastasis (P<0.05). The expression level of KDR in patients with hepatic metastasis was significantly higher compared with patients without hepatic metastasis (P<0.05). The co-expression level of VEGF and KDR in patients with hepatic metastasis was significantly higher compared with patients without hepatic metastasis (P<0.05) and the Flt-1 expression level in patients with ascites <1,000 ml was significantly lower than that in patients with ascites â‰¥1000 ml (P<0.05). The mean MVD of VEGF- and KDR-positive patients was significantly higher compared with VEGF- and KDR-negative patients (P<0.05). The expression of VEGF and its receptors is involved in the malignant transformation of ovarian tumors, tumor progression and metastasis, as well as ascites formation and angiogenesis.
