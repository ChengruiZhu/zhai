Intestinal lamina propria T lymphocytes (LP-Ts) have a markedly low proliferative potential both in vivo and in vitro. Here, we have identified that the capacity of antigen-presenting cells to release cysteine upon receptorâ€“ligand interactions represents a critical parameter for proliferation of LP-Ts. The availability of cysteine is limiting for the intracellular production of glutathione, which in turn is essential for cell cycle progression. When cysteine is provided either directly or by addition of the reducing agent 2-mercaptoethanol to cystine-containing culture medium, proliferation of LP-T is fully restored. Importantly, coculture with peripheral blood monocytes that easily take up cystine, reduce cystine, and secrete cysteine also restores reactivity of LP-Ts to T cell receptor/CD3 stimulation. In marked contrast, lamina propria macrophages lack this capacity to elaborate cysteine, and thereby secure physiological unresponsiveness to antigen exposure in the intestinal microenvironment. The well-documented local recruitment of blood monocytes in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) may thus represent an important parameter underlying hyperresponsiveness of T cells, an essential component of the pathogenesis of IBD.
