Exacerbations of COPD that result in acute respiratory failure requiring intubation and mechanical ventilation have high morbidity and mortality. This study is a retrospective observational study that compared the outcomes of 237 patients with COPD and acute respiratory failure requiring intensive care unit (ICU) admission according to modality of initial therapy: mask continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP), medical therapy, or intubation. Of the patients treated with CPAP initially, only 16% failed and required intubation compared with 62% of those treated medically (p=0.001). The median length of ICU stay was 5 days in those treated with CPAP, compared with 7 days for those medically treated, and 8.5 days for intubated patients (p=0.001). When compared with mask CPAP, and after adjusting for potentially confounding differences, mortality was significantly higher if patients were initially intubated (adjusted odds ratios [OR] 15.7; 95% confidence interval [CI] 4.2, 59) or given medical therapy (OR 5.1; CI 1.2, 20.8). In COPD patients with acute respiratory failure, initial treatment with mask CPAP was associated with significantly better outcomes than other treatment modalities, even after adjusting for potentially confounding differences in disease severity.
