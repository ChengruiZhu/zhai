Here we review the technical aspects of our experience with the neuroendoscopic bilateral nostril (binostril) transsphenoidal approach for pituitary adenomas. A total of 42 patients were treated in our hospital from September 2013 to December 2015. Total tumor resection was completed in 31 cases, nearly full resection was achieved in 9 cases, and partial resection was achieved in 2 cases. In most cases clinical symptoms were relieved after surgery. These included 18/22 cases with visual field and vision disorders; 19/25 cases with headaches; 11/15 cases where high baseline PRL returned to normal levels; 6/7 cases where elevated blood GH returned to normal levels; and 2/3 cases where elevated blood ACTH returned to normal levels after surgery. Postoperative complications were observed in 13 patients: 8 cases of diabetes insipidus, 4 cases of cerebrospinal fluid rhinorrhea, and 1 case of subarachnoid hemorrhage. Among the key advantages of the neuroendoscopic binostril transsphenoidal approach for pituitary adenoma resection are its minimally-invasive nature, clear exposure of the operative field, high full-excision rates, improved peri-operative safety, and minor patient trauma with fewer postoperative complications.
