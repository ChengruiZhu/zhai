Neuraxial blockade such as spinal anaesthesia can cause severe hypotension due to pharmacological sympathectomy resulting in potential deleterious consequences for the patient. Prevention of this spinal anaesthesia induced hypotension is of utmost importance especially in pregnant population as the life of mother as well as fetus is at risk. Several techniques and methodologies have been adopted for the prevention of this neuraxial hypotension with varying degree of success. The administration of intravenous fluids to optimize the blood volume during sympathectomy has been the most popular and widely used as the first line of therapy among these techniques. The intravenous fluids can be used both before and during the administration of spinal anaesthesia, the techniques appropriately named as pre-loading and co-loading respectively. Numerous research studies and available literary evidence suggests that both of these techniques can be equally effective in prevention of hypotension. The use of colloids has been observed to be more effective for pre-loading due to their longer half-life in the intravascular compartment. However, it has also been suggested that no technique is efficient in preventing the hypotension alone and has to be coupled with judicious use of vasopressors.
