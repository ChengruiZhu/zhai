New regimens based on 2 or more novel agents are sought to shorten or to simplify treatment of tuberculosis (TB), including drug-resistant forms. Prior studies showed that the novel combinations of bedaquiline (BDQ) plus pretomanid (PMD) plus pyrazinamide (PZA) and PMD plus moxifloxacin (MXF) plus PZA shortened the treatment duration necessary to prevent relapse by 2 to 3 months and 1 to 2 months, respectively, compared with the current first-line regimen, in a murine TB model. These 3-drug combinations are now being studied in clinical trials. Here, the 4-drug combination of BDQ+PMD+MXF+PZA was compared to its 3-drug component regimens and different treatment durations of PZA and MXF were explored, to identify the optimal regimens and treatment times and to estimate the likelihood of success against drug-resistant strains. BDQ+PMD+MXF+PZA rendered all mice relapse-free after 2 months of treatment. PZA administration could be discontinued after the first month of treatment without worsening outcomes, whereas the absence of MXF, PZA, or BDQ administration from the beginning necessitated approximately 0.5, 1, or 2 months, respectively, of additional treatment to attain the same outcome.
