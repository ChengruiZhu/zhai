Although two related species may appear similar, the genetic pathways that underpin this shared biology may have drifted and changed. This phenomenon is known as Developmental System Drift (DSD). One consequence of DSD is that equivalent genes may play different roles in phenotypically similar, related species but there have been no systematic studies to examine this. How often do genes have different functions in similar species? Are certain genes more likely to change functions? Finally, what are the molecular changes that drive this? Here, we compare the effects of reducing the levels of over 1300 different genes in two species of nematode worm. These worms are very similarâ€” they live in the same ecological niche, and have near-identical development and behavior. We find that over 25% of conserved genes have different functions in these two species, showing that DSD has a major impact on how gene function evolves. Intriguingly, we find that genes that have arisen recently are most likely to change functions and that this is often driven by changes in their expression. This is the first systematic comparison of loss of function phenotypes in related species and sheds light on how genetic pathways rewire during DSD.
