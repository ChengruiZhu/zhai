Various plastic procedures are done to enhance esthetics, relieve hypersensitivity or even prevent root caries. The most predictable plastic procedure is the coronally advanced flap procedure, with subepithelial connective tissue. Owing to the second surgical donor site and difficulty in procuring a sufficient graft in multiple recessions, various alternative additive membranes are used. This is a case report, the first of its kind, wherein a bilaterally occurring multiple Millers class I recession was managed by using Platelet-rich Fibrin (PrF) and amniotic membrane, in a 40-year-old male, who presented to the Department of Periodontics. He complained of hypersensitivity in relation to the upper right and left back region, a bilateral Millers class I recession in relation to 15, 16, and 25, 26 of 3 mm each. Both the recessions were planned for root coverage with coronally advanced flap and additive membrane. The sites were randomly assigned for the use of platelet-rich fibrin and an aminotic membrane. The clinical outcome of the surgical procedure accounted for 100% root coverage, an enhanced gingival biotype, with both the membranes. Furthermore, the results were stable even after seven months in the amniotic membrane-treated site. Hence, the use of amniotic membrane as a novel approach to root coverage is more advantageous than PrF owing to the laboratory preparation of the autologous biomaterial.
