Neurons in the cerebral cortex are highly interconnected. However, the mechanisms of coordinated processing in the neuronal network are not yet understood. Theoretical studies have proposed synchronized electrical impulses (spikes) propagating between groups of nerve cells as a basis of cortical processing. Indeed, animal studies provide experimental evidence that spike synchronization occurs in relation to behavior. However, the observation of sequences of synchronous activity has not been reported so far, presumably due to two fundamental problems. First, the long-standing lack of simultaneous recordings of large populations of neurons, which only recently were enabled by advances in recording technology. Second, the absence of proper tools required to find these activity patterns in such high-dimensional data. Addressing the second issue, we introduce here a fully automatized mathematical method that advances an existing visual approach to identify sequences of synchronous events in large data sets. We demonstrate the efficacy of our method on a range of simulated test data that capture the characteristics and variability of experimental data. Our tool will serve future studies in their search for spike time coordination at millisecond precision in the brain.
