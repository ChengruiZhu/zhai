Hepatoblastoma (HB) is one of the most common hepatic malignancies in the pediatric population. HB are composed of a variety of tumors, which derived from different origins and had varying clinical outcomes. However, the unclear underlying mechanisms of HB limited exploring novel biomarkers and effective therapeutic targets. We searched microarray datasets on Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database and selected GSE75271 and GSE75283 datasets for comprehensive analysis. Weighted gene correlation network analysis (WGCNA) was employed to identify genes which were associated with tumor malignant phenotypes, including HB subtypes, Cairo classification and tumor stage. Coexpression analysis of identified genes was also performed and lncRNA-miRNA-mRNA network was finally conducted. Our results showed that a total of 22 lncRNAs, 13 miRNAs and 66 mRNAs were identified to be associated with tumor malignant phenotypes. Mechanistically, these molecules might promote the malignant phenotypes via regulating metabolic pathways. Among of them, 6 miRNAs (hsa-miR-106b, hsa-miR-130b, hsa-miR-19a, hsa-miR-19b, hsa-miR-20a and hsa-miR-301a), 8 lncRNAs (NR_102317, XR_245338, XR_428373, XR_924945, XR_929728, XR_931611, XR_935074 and XR_946696), and 6 mRNAs (
