Viruses encode a wide array of proteins whose principle function is to disable the surveillance and effector functions of the immune system. A common viral target is the MHC class I antigen processing and presentation pathway, which is a potent mechanism used by the host for the detection and killing of virally infected cells. In this study we have delineated the immune evasion mechanism of the cowpox-encoded CPXV203 protein, which is known to potently block the normal trafficking of MHCI from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) to the plasma membrane. CPXV203 does this by highjacking an ER-retrieval system that usually serves to capture defective, chaperone complexed MHCI proteins in the Golgi and send them to the ER. We show that CPXV203 adopts a compact beta-sandwich structure and engages evolutionarily conserved MHCI determinants that are located under the peptide-binding platform. The viral protein binds a variety of different MHCI proteins weakly at the pH found in the ER, but the affinity and half-life are significantly augmented at the more acidic conditions found in the Golgi. Together these data suggest that CPXV203 works cooperatively with the endogenous ER retrieval process to promiscuously target fully assembled MHCI, thereby preventing T-cell killing of cowpox infected cells.
