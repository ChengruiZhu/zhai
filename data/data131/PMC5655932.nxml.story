Acellular xenogeneic tissues have the potential to provide ‘off‐the‐shelf’ grafts for anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) repair. To ensure that such grafts are sterile following packaging, it is desirable to use terminal sterilization methods. Here, the effects of gamma and electron beam irradiation on the biological and biomechanical properties of a previously developed acellular porcine superflexor tendon (pSFT) were investigated. Irradiation following treatment with peracetic acid was compared to peracetic acid treatment alone and the stability of grafts following long‐term storage assessed. Irradiation did not affect total collagen content or biocompatibility (determined using a contact cytotoxicity assay) of the grafts, but slightly increased the amount of denatured collagen in and decreased the thermal denaturation temperature of the tissue in a dose dependant fashion. Biomechanical properties of the grafts were altered by irradiation (reduced ultimate tensile strength and Young's modulus, increased failure strain), but remained superior to reported properties of the native human ACL. Long term storage at 4°C had no negative effects on the grafts. Of all the conditions tested, a dose of minimum 25 kGy of gamma irradiation had least effect on the grafts, suggesting that this dose produces a biocompatible pSFT graft with adequate mechanical properties for ACL repair. © 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.
