Separating the time scale of oscillations from that of the phase dynamics allowed for reducing a network of coupled neural mass models to a system of phase oscillators. We studied the dynamics of networks of phases and their synchronization characteristics as being seminal for functional neural networks. We put particular focus on effects of time delays in the coupling on the network dynamics and contrasted that to effects due to altered structural connectivity. Does neuroanatomical structure prescribe all the macroscopic activity patterns that we observe through electrophysiological brain recordings? We found that heterogeneity in structural coupling and distributed delays have equivalent effects on the shape of phase distributions, i.e., on functional connectivity. The contribution of changes in structural connectivity to network synchronization can therefore not readily be distinguished from that of distributed delays. Interestingly, the emergence of phase clusters in networks requires a subtle interplay between coupling and delays, which may form a window into disentangling structural effects from those induced by delay distributions. Therefore, when investigating neural network behavior, both structural connectivity and delay distribution should be addressed.
