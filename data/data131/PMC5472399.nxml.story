Diverticulitis is a common ailment that is prevalent in the developed world. As such, the management of diverticulitis places a substantial economic burden on healthcare. Research is ongoing to further elucidate both the pathogenesis of the disease, as well as ways to reduce associated expenditures. One of these emerging areas of research calls into question the use of antibiotics during treatment of acute uncomplicated diverticulitis. Current guidelines are largely based on expert opinion, with little evidence supporting the standard practice of antibiotic therapy. In this literature review, we have compiled and analyzed the latest collection of evidence in managing acute uncomplicated diverticulitis. There have been two randomized controlled trials (RCTs) performed that assessed the possibility of treating acute uncomplicated diverticulitis without antibiotics. Both the Antibiotika Vid Okomplicerad Divertikulit (AVOD) study and Daniels, et al. have found that an observational approach to acute uncomplicated diverticulitis is not inferior to antibiotic treatment and does not result in increased complication or recurrence rates. We also reviewed a single-center cohort study, a prospective observational study, and two retrospective case-controlled studies comparing observational management versus antibiotic treatment in patients with acute uncomplicated diverticulitis. We found the results were comparable; there was no difference in complication rates or recurrence in any study. The consensus among the studies reviewed challenges the current practice guidelines issued by the American Gastroenterological Association. However, given the geographical difference in diverticular disease and inherent bias found in these studies, we cannot recommend a modification of the guidelines. Based on this literature review, we feel compelled to suggest, and strongly recommend, further research be conducted in the United States in order to bolster the already significant evidence against antibiotic therapy in acute uncomplicated diverticulitis.
