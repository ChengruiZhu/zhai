Obesity is an excess fat mass leading to metabolic diseases. Dietary management is a conventional strategy to promote weight loss. As energy buffering, in the form of esterified fatty acids, and secretory organ, the adipose tissue has a pivotal role in obesity and its related complications. A comprehensive insight of adipose tissue response during and after calorie restriction might improve obesity management. Modern nutrition research study the impact of diet on health by combining multiple datasets to provide an holistic view of tissue physiopathology. To identify significant clusters of fatty acids, transcripts or bio-clinical parameters related to weight change along calorie restriction and subsequent weight follow-up in obese individuals, the issue of different datasets integration must be resolved. Here, we implemented an innovative multistep approach to infer multi-data networks and compare clusters of network components. This original strategy highlighted an unexpected central role of a minor adipose tissue fatty acid, myristoleic acid, which is not provided by food. Its link to transcripts encoding enzymes from a pathway converting glucose into fat that mediates favorable metabolic effects makes myristoleic acid a key factor of the positive impact of fat mass reduction.
