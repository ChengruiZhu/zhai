Spike adaptation is a property of most neurons. When spike time adaptation occurs over multiple time scales, the dynamics can be described by a power-law. We study the computational properties of a leaky integrate-and-fire model with power-law adaptation. Instead of explicitly modeling the adaptation process by the contribution of slowly changing conductances, we use a fractional temporal derivative framework. The exponent of the fractional derivative represents the degree of adaptation of the membrane voltage, where 1 is the normal leaky integrator while values less than 1 produce increasing correlations in the voltage trace. The temporal correlation is interpreted as a memory trace that depends on the value of the fractional derivative. We identify the memory trace in the fractional model as the sum of the instantaneous differentiation weighted by a function that depends on the fractional exponent, and it provides non-local information to the incoming stimulus. The spiking dynamics of the fractional leaky integrate-and-fire model show memory dependence that can result in downward or upward spike adaptation. Our model provides a framework for understanding how long-range membrane voltage correlations affect spiking dynamics and information integration in neurons.
