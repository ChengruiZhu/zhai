Dry eye syndrome is a prevalent disease that affects visual acuity, activities of daily living, and quality of life. A number of contributory factors affect the severity of dry eye syndrome, including autoimmune disease, environmental surroundings, contact lens use, hormonal changes, anatomical features, chronic inflammation, infections, and iatrogenic factors, such as medications or surgery. Symptoms may include intermittent or constant blurry vision, discomfort, burning, foreign body sensation, hyperemia, dryness, and photophobia. The severity of dry eye syndrome can range from very mild disease to extremely severe cases with vision-threatening consequences. A variety of dry eye treatment modalities exist to address the different causes, symptoms, and consequences of ocular surface disease, including artificial tears, lubricating gels, ophthalmic inserts, anti-inflammatory drops, and surgical procedures. In this paper, an assortment of literature pertaining to the treatment of dry eye syndrome, in particular hydroxypropyl cellulose ophthalmic inserts, is reviewed. These inserts can be used effectively as monotherapy, or in conjunction with other therapies, and should be considered in the treatment of dry eye syndrome.
