A 1:1 matched case-control study was conducted to analyze the association between three common interleukin (IL)-17A and IL-17F single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and the risk of developing gastric cancer. Genotyping of SNPs rs2275913, rs763780 and rs3748067 within the IL-17 gene were detected by performing polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis. Gastric cancer patients were more likely to be cigarette smokers, alcohol drinkers and have a family history of cancer in their first-degree relatives. Patients carrying the rs763780 polymorphism were correlated with a significant increased risk of gastric cancer in codominant, dominant and recessive models. Additionally, individuals with the rs763780 polymorphism were correlated with a markedly increased risk of gastric cancer among alcohol drinkers in codominant, dominant and recessive models. Furthermore, a significant correlation was identified between the rs763780 polymorphism and the consumption of alcohol. However, no association was identified between rs2275913 and rs3748067 polymorphisms and the risk of developing gastric cancer. Thus, the present study reported that the rs763780 polymorphism may be associated with risk of developing gastric cancer in the population studied, particularly in alcohol drinkers.
