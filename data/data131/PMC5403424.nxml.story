Osteosarcoma is an aggressive pediatric tumor affecting growing bones that typically occurs in adolescents and young adults. Although advances in treatment have been made in recent years, a high proportion of patients relapse due to metastases, which are frequently resistant to chemotherapy and pose a significant threat to long-term survival. Previous studies have demonstrated that the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is associated with cancer occurrence and metastasis, and our previous study demonstrated the occurrence of EMT in osteosarcoma. Notch is a regulator involved in several cellular processes, and previous studies have identified that the Notch signaling pathway may be activated during chemotherapy. However, whether chemotherapy affects the EMT remains to be elucidated. To address this issue, in the present study osteosarcoma cells were exposed to sublethal doses of doxorubicin, which resulted in upregulation of the expression of genes in the Notch signaling pathway and its target genes. Furthermore, doxorubicin treatment promoted mesenchymal-like properties and enhanced the migration and invasion of cells. In addition, treatment with the selective Î³-secretase inhibitor DAPT was able to prevent the EMT and inhibit the
