The Vitamin D receptor (VDR) expressed in normal breast tissue and breast tumors has been suggested as a new prognostic biomarker in breast cancer (BC). Besides, increasing evidence supports the view that the detection of circulating tumor cells (CTCs) predicts outcome in early and metastatic BC. Consequently, an evaluation of VDR expression in the CTCs of BC patients may allow optimization of their treatment. As an attempt to profile and subtype the CTCs of metastatic patients, we established an innovative fluorescence technique using nine BC cell lines to visualize, define, and compare their individual VDR status. Afterwards, we tested the CTC presence and VDR expression in blood samples (cytospins) collected from 23 metastatic BC patients. The results demonstrated major differences in the VDR levels among the nine cell lines, and VDR positive CTCs were detected in 46% of CTC-positive patients, with a total of 42 CTCs individually analyzed. Due to the limited number of patients in this study, no correlation between VDR expression and BC subtype classification (according to estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR) and HER2) could be determined, but our data support the view that VDR evaluation is a potential new prognostic biomarker to help in the optimization of therapy management for BC patients.
