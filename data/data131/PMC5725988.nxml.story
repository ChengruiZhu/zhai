Many methods for vasculature induction have been reported recently. In this review, we introduced several methods which are adjustable vascularization in three-dimensional tissues according to three steps. First, “selection” provides potents for engineered tissues with vascularization ability. Second, “assembly technology” is used to fabricate tissues as three-dimensional structures and simultaneously inner neo-vasculature. Third, a “perfusion” technique is used for maturation of blood vessels in three-dimensional tissues. In “selection”, selection of cells and materials gives the ability to promote angiogenesis in three-dimensional tissues. During the cell assembly step, cell sheet engineering, nanofilm coating technology, and three-dimensional printing technology could be used to produce vascularized three-dimensional tissues. Perfusion techniques to perfuse blood or cell culture medium throughout three-dimensional tissues with a unified inlet and outlet could induce functional blood vessels within retransplantable three-dimensional tissues. Combination of each step technology allows simulation of perivascular microenvironments in target tissues and drive vascularization in three-dimensional tissues.
