Triple negative breast cancers (TNBC) have poor prognosis compared to other breast cancer subtypes and represent 15-20% of breast cancers diagnosed. Unique targets and new molecularly-targeted therapies are urgently needed for this subtype. Despite high expression of Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor, inhibitors such as lapatinib have not shown therapeutic efficacy in TNBC patients. Herein, we report that treatment with the covalent JNK inhibitor, JNK-IN-8, synergizes with lapatinib to cause cell death, while these compounds as single agents have little effect. The combination significantly increases survival of mice bearing xenografts of MDA-MB-231 human TNBC cells. Our studies demonstrate that lapatinib treatment increases c-Jun and JNK phosphorylation indicating a mechanism of resistance. Combined, these compounds significantly reduce transcriptional activity of Nuclear Factor kappa B, Activating Protein 1, and Nuclear factor erythroid 2-Related Factor 2. As master regulators of antioxidant response, their decreased activity induces a 10-fold increase in reactive oxygen species that is cytotoxic, and is rescued by addition of exogenous antioxidants. Over expression of p65 or Nrf2 also significantly rescues viability during JNK-IN-8 and lapatinib treatment. Further studies combining JNK-IN-8 and lapatinib may reveal a benefit for patients with TNBC, fulfilling a critical medical need.
