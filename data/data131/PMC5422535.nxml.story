Angiogenesis is a process by which vessels are formed through preexisting ones, and this plays a key role in the progression of solid tumors. However, tumor vessels are influenced by excessive pro-angiogenic factors, resulting in deformed structures that facilitate the intravasation of tumor cells into the circulation and subsequent metastasis. Moreover, abnormal tumor vessels have low blood perfusion and thereby decreased oxygen infusion into tumors. This results in a hostile microenvironment that promotes epithelialâ€“mesenchymal transition (EMT), a process in which epithelial cells lose their polarity and gain increased motility, which is associated with metastasis and invasion. Here, we demonstrate that gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) facilitate tumor vasculature normalization, increase blood perfusion and alleviate hypoxia in melanoma tumors. Additionally, AuNPs were observed to reverse EMT in tumors, accompanied by the alleviation of lung metastasis. These AuNPs inhibited the migration of B16F10 cells and reversed EMT in B16F10 cells, indicating that AuNPs could directly regulate EMT independent of improvements in hypoxia. Taken together, our data demonstrated that AuNPs could induce tumor vasculature normalization and reverse EMT, resulting in decreased melanoma tumor metastasis.
