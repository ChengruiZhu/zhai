Proliferator-activated receptor-γ (PPAR-γ) is a nuclear receptor that acts as a transcription factor in several types of tissue. PPAR-γ ligands are known to inhibit numerous cancer cell processes, including pancreatic cancer cell proliferation through terminal differentiation. Previous studies concerning the inhibitory effect of PPAR-γ ligands derived from thiazolidinediones (TZDs) on the metastatic potential of cancer cells have been reported. The present study aimed to investigate whether pioglitazone, a prescription TZD class drug and a ligand of PPAR-γ, inhibits the proliferation and metastasis of pancreatic cancer cells. The inhibitory effect of pioglitazone on the proliferation of the Capan-1, Aspc-1, BxPC-3, PANC-1 and MIApaCa-2 pancreatic cancer cell lines was analyzed. Alterations in carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), interleukin-8 (IL-8) and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) mRNA expression levels subsequent to pioglitazone treatment were examined in BxPC-3 cells by quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. In addition, whether the oral administration of pioglitazone prevents tumorigenesis and spontaneous BxPC-3 cell lymph node and lung metastases was investigated using a rectal xenograft model. Pioglitazone treatment resulted in the inhibition of proliferation in all five pancreatic cancer cell lines
