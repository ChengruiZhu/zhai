In this report, we have examined the requirement for the retinoblastoma (Rb) gene family in neuronal determination with a focus on the developing neocortex. To determine whether pRb is required for neuronal determination in vivo, we crossed the Rb−/− mice with transgenic mice expressing β-galactosidase from the early, panneuronal Tα1 α-tubulin promoter (Tα1:nlacZ). In E12.5 Rb−/− embryos, the Tα1:nlacZ transgene was robustly expressed throughout the developing nervous system. However, by E14.5, there were perturbations in Tα1:nlacZ expression throughout the nervous system, including deficits in the forebrain and retina. To more precisely define the temporal requirement for pRb in neuronal determination, we functionally ablated the pRb family in wild-type cortical progenitor cells that undergo the transition to postmitotic neurons in vitro by expression of a mutant adenovirus E1A protein. These studies revealed that induction of Tα1:nlacZ did not require proteins of the pRb family. However, in their absence, determined, Tα1:nlacZ-positive cortical neurons underwent apoptosis, presumably as a consequence of “mixed signals” deriving from their inability to undergo terminal mitosis. In contrast, when the pRb family was ablated in postmitotic cortical neurons, there was no effect on neuronal survival, nor did it cause the postmitotic neurons to reenter the cell cycle. Together, these studies define a critical temporal window of requirement for the pRb family; these proteins are not required for induction of neuronal gene expression or for the maintenance of postmitotic neurons, but are essential for determined neurons to exit the cell cycle and survive.
