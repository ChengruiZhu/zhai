Paraoxonase1 (PON1) activity is closely related to coronary artery disease (CAD). However, whether PON1 activity can predict the degree of coronary stenosis remains unknown. In the present study, the serum PON1 activity and related factors that influence PON1 activity were analyzed in 186 patients with diagnostic coronary angiography. The serum PON1 activity was determined using a spectrophotometry-based assay in 186 patients with diagnostic coronary angiography, in which coronary stenosis severity was graded and clinically defined as single- or multi-vessel stenosis >50%. Target lesion stenosis was quantified via quantitative coronary angiography (QCA). The serum PON1 activity was significantly decreased in the CAD group, the multiple coronary stenosis subgroup, and the diabetes mellitus subgroup compared with each control group. The PON1 activity was positively correlated with the High density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) and Apolipoprotein A1 (ApoA1). Males, smoking, diabetes, and heart failure were identified as factors that influenced PON1 activity. Furthermore, a Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve (ROC) analysis indicated that a PON1 activity cut-off point of 330 U/L could predict CAD with a sensitivity of 52% and a specificity of 65%. In conclusion, low PON1 activity predicted the degree of coronary lesion, particularly in multiple vessel lesions, smokers, and diabetes, which may represent a biochemical marker for the severity of CAD.
