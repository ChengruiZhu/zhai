Ewing sarcoma breakpoint region 1 (EWSR1) fusion with Friend leukemia integration 1 transcription factor (FLI1) induced by a translocation of chromosome 11 with 22 contributes to Ewing sarcoma development. To date, the precise molecular mechanisms about EWSR1/FLI1 involving in Ewing sarcoma development remains to be defined. This study explored the potential critical gene targets of EWSR1/FLI1 knockdown in Ewing sarcoma cells on the gene expression profile based on online dataset, performed Limma algorithm for differentially expressed genes identification, constructed the transcriptional factor (TF)-gene regulatory network based on integrate transcriptional regulatory element database (TRED). The data showed up- and down-regulation of differentially expressed genes over time and peaked at 72Â h after EWSR1/FLI1 knockdown in Ewing sarcoma cells. SMAD3 were up-regulated and FLI1, MYB, E2F1, ETS2, WT1 were down-regulated with more than half of their targets were down-regulated after EWSR1/FLI1 knockdown. The Gene Ontology (GO) and pathway annotation of these differentially expressed genes showed a consistent trend in each group of samples. Totally, there were 355 differentially expressed genes occurring in all five comparison groups of different time points, in which 39 genes constructed a dysregulated TF-gene network in Ewing sarcoma cell line A673 after EWSR1/FLI1 knockdown. These data demonstrated that knockdown of EWSR1/FLI1 expression led to transcriptome changes in Ewing sarcoma cells and that Ewing sarcoma development and progression caused by altered EWSR1/FLI1 expression may be associated with more complex transcriptome changes.
