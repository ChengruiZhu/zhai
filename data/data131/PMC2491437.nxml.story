Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry (FT-ICR/MS) is the best MS technology for obtaining exact mass measurements owing to its great resolution and accuracy, and several outstanding FT-ICR/MS-based metabolomics approaches have been reported. A reliable annotation scheme is needed to deal with direct-infusion FT-ICR/MS metabolic profiling. Correlation analyses can help us not only uncover relations between the ions but also annotate the ions originated from identical metabolites (metabolite derivative ions). In the present study, we propose a procedure for metabolite annotation on direct-infusion FT-ICR/MS by taking into consideration the classification of metabolite-derived ions using correlation analyses. Integrated analysis based on information of isotope relations, fragmentation patterns by MS/MS analysis, co-occurring metabolites, and database searches (KNApSAcK and KEGG) can make it possible to annotate ions as metabolites and estimate cellular conditions based on metabolite composition. A total of 220 detected ions were classified into 174 metabolite derivative groups and 72 ions were assigned to candidate metabolites in the present work. Finally, metabolic profiling has been able to distinguish between the growth stages with the aid of PCA. The constructed model using PLS regression for OD
