A total of 25 patients were enrolled. The 14 patients treated surgically sustained injuries at 46.98 ± 9.73 years of age, were repaired at 28.14 ± 14.06 days, and evaluated at 50.62 ± 10.11 years of age. The 11 patients treated non-operatively sustained injuries at 55.6 ± 10.45 years of age (p = 0.05), attempted therapy an average of 4.6 ± 3.22 months, and were evaluated at 58.4 ± 8.31 years of age (p= 0.06). The LEFS for the surgical and non-surgical groups was 74.71 ± 5.38 and 68.5 ± 7.92 (p = 0.04), respectively. SF-12 mental and physical components scores were similar between groups. The average single leg hop of the injured extremity in the surgical and non-surgical groups was 119.1 ± 27.68 cm and 56.1 ± 31.2 cm (p = 0.0001), respectively. When compared to the uninjured leg, the average single leg hop in the injured leg was 5.1 ± 12.1 cm and 1.2 ± 17.2 cm (p = 0.51) shorter in both the surgical and non-surgical groups, respectively. The LEFS had a weak correlation with the average single leg hop and age in the surgical (R2 = 0.2478 and 0.0664, respectively) and non-surgical (R2 = 0.0023 and 0.052, respectively) groups. The patient's perception of strength was similar between the surgical and non-surgical groups (86.07 ± 12.12% and 83.6 ± 14.15%, p = 0.64). All patients in the operative group were able to return to pre-injury activities whereas three were unable to in the non-operative group (chi-square stat = 4.33, p = 0.03).
