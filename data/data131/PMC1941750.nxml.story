Transposons are present at high copy number in diverse organisms ranging from single-celled bacteria to complex mammals and plants. Transposons are mobile genetic elements that can replicate and move to new locations within the genome. An ongoing debate exists regarding whether transposons are merely genetic parasites or whether they confer a benefit to the host organism. Previous studies have demonstrated that mobilization of transposable elements is induced in response to different cell stresses. Here, we describe the direct mechanism by which the fission yeast Tf2 class of retrotransposons is physiologically activated in response to changes in environmental oxygen. Tf2 transcription and mobilization are dramatically induced under low oxygen by the yeast ortholog of mammalian SREBP, a transcription factor that controls cholesterol homeostasis. Our studies demonstrate that Tf2 elements direct oxygen-dependent transcription of adjacent sequences, and a genome-wide survey identified several genes whose expression is under Tf2 control. These findings suggest that mobilization of Tf2 to new locations in the genome could reengineer the cell's transcriptional network with potentially beneficial consequences to the host.
