Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada (VKH) disease and central serous chorioretinopathy (CSC) develop serous retinal detachment; however, the treatment of each disease is totally different. Steroids treat VKH but worsen CSC; therefore, it is important to distinguish these diseases. Here, we report a case with CSC which was diagnosed by en face optical coherence tomography (OCT) imaging during the course of VKH disease. A 50-year-old man was referred with blurring of vision in his right eye. Fundus examination showed bilateral optic disc swelling and macular fluid in the right eye. OCT showed thick choroid, and en face OCT images depicted blurry choroid without clear delineation of choroidal vessels. Combined with angiography findings, this patient was diagnosed with VKH disease and treated with steroids. Promptly, fundus abnormalities resolved with the reduction of the choroidal thickness and the choroidal vessels became visible on the en face images. During the tapering of the steroid, serous macular detachment in the right eye recurred several times. Steroid treatment was effective at first; however, at the fourth appearance of submacular fluid, the patient did not respond. At that time, the choroidal vessels on the en face OCT images were clear, which significantly differed from the images at the time of recurrence of VKH. Angiography also suggested CSC-like leakage. The tapering of the steroids was effective in resolving the fluid. Secondary CSC may develop in the eye with VKH after steroid treatment. En face OCT observation of the choroid may be helpful to distinguish each condition.
