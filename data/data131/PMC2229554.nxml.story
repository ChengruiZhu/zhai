/Pi cotransporter (NaPi-IIa) have been shown previously to contain functionally important sites by applying the substituted cysteine accessibility method (SCAM). Incubation in methanethiosulfonate (MTS) reagents of mutants that contain novel cysteines in both loops led to full inhibition of cotransport activity. To elucidate further the role these regions play in defining the transport mechanism, a double mutant (A203C-S460C) was constructed with novel cysteines in each region. The effect of cysteine modification by different MTS reagents on two electrogenic transport modes (leak and cotransport) was investigated. MTSEA (2-aminoethyl MTS hydrobromide) and MTSES (MTS ethylsulfonate) led to full inhibition of cotransport and increased the leak, whereas incubation in MTSET (2-[trimethylammonium]ethyl MTS bromide) inhibited only cotransport. The behavior of other double mutants with a cysteine retained at one site and hydrophobic or hydrophilic residues substituted at the other site, indicated that most likely only Cys-460 was modifiable, but the residue at Ala-203 was critical for conferring the leak and cotransport mode behavior. Substrate interaction with the double mutant was unaffected by MTS exposure as the apparent P
