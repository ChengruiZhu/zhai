Ras signaling pathways play an important role in cellular proliferation and survival, and inappropriate activation of Ras frequently results in cell transformation and cancer. Human T-cell leukemia/lymphoma virus type 1 (HTLV-1) is the etiological agent of the adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma (ATLL), a severe malignancy that has a poor prognosis and exhibits resistance to conventional chemotherapy. Although the mechanisms involved in cell transformation by HTLV-1 have not been completely clarified, it is generally thought that Tax plays a pivotal role in the process. We have previously proposed that a functionally active Ras protein is needed for efficient anti-apoptotic activity of Tax. In this study we report data indicating that the apoptotic resistance of cells expressing Tax, constitutively or transiently, is linked to the intracellular levels of Ras-GTP. Indeed, we found that Tax-positive cells have a high content of active Ras, and that inhibition of Ras signaling, using the antagonist farnesyl thyosalicylic acid (FTS), increases their sensitivity to apoptosis. FTS treatment was also accompanied by a decrease in ERK, but not Akt, phosphorylation. Thus, all together our data suggest that the interaction between Tax and Ras could be important to ATLL pathogenesis, and indicate Ras as a possible target for therapeutic intervention in ATLL patients.
