In 2009, consensus guidelines were published on intensification of insulin therapy using the premix analog biphasic insulin aspart (BIAsp) 30 in the treatment of type 2 diabetes, based on the recommendations of an international, independent expert panel. The guidelines included recommendations and titration algorithms for intensification from basal insulin once (OD) or twice daily (BID) to BIAsp 30 BID, from OD BIAsp 30 to BID, and from BID BIAsp 30 to three times daily (TID). Building on these recommendations, the objective was to develop similar, simple and effective guidelines for intensification switch from a BIAsp 30 to a mid-/high-ratio premix regimen for the vast majority of patients with type 2 diabetes. A panel of independent experts with extensive clinical experience in premix analog therapy met in October 2009 to review the therapeutic role of mid- and high-ratio premixes (BIAsp 50 and 70, respectively). The panel outlined a series of algorithms for intensifying BIAsp 30 BID and TID with mid-/high-ratio premixes, along with practical suggestions relating to intensification for individual patients. A simple tool to aid dose adjustment was also developed. The guidelines suggested here should assist physicians in introducing mid-/high-ratio premixes to optimize the insulin therapy of patients with type 2 diabetes who are failing to achieve glycemic targets on a BIAsp 30 BID or TID regimen.
