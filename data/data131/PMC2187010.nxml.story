The results of this study with the P815 mastocytoma confirm the results of previous studies that showed that the passive transfer of tumor- sensitized T cells from immunized donors can cause the regression of tumors growing in T cell-deficient (TXB) recipients, but not in normal recipients. The key additional finding was that the expression of adoptive immunity against tumors growing in TXB recipients is immediately preceded by a substantial production of cytolytic T cells in the recipients' draining lymph node. On the other hand, failure of adoptive immunity to be expressed against tumors growing in normal recipients was associated with a cytolytic T cell response of much lower magnitude, and a similar low magnitude response was generated in TXB recipients infused with normal spleen cells and in tumor-bearing control mice. Because the passively transferred sensitized T cells possessed no cytolytic activity of their own, the results indicate that the 6-8-d delay before adoptive immunity is expressed represents the time needed for passively transferred helper or memory T cells to give rise to a cytolytic T cell response of sufficient magnitude to destroy the recipient's tumor. In support of this interpretation was the additional finding that inhibition of the expression of adoptive immunity by the passive transfer of suppressor T cells from tumor- bearing donors was associated with a substantially reduced cytolytic T cell response in the recipient's draining lymph node. The results serve to illustrate that interpretation of the results of adoptive immunization experiments requires a knowledge of the events that take place in the adoptively immunized recipient. They support the interpretation that suppressor T cells function in this model to "down- regulate" the production of cytolytic effector T cells.
