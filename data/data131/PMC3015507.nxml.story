The diagnostic accuracy of laparoscopy for impalpable testis is well recognized. However, in some cases, laparoscopic findings may be misleading, and a viable gonad may be missed with significant medico-legal implications. From January 1993 to December 2000, 202 patients with 219 impalpable testes were evaluated. In 95 cases, the gonad was immediately visualized, and in 5, the presence of a testis was documented by inserting the scope into the processus vaginalis. In the 119 remaining cases, no gonad was seen while entering the abdomen with the laparoscope. All patients with documented vas and vessels exiting the inguinal ring were surgically explored. Ten testes were found, 8 ectopic, with significant changes in shape and position, and 2 were canalicular. In the absence of hormone stimulation, no testes were found while exploring patients with cord structures coursing a closed inguinal ring and with contralateral hypertrophy. In 1 patient with absent vas and vessels, the testis was found at the lower renal pole while removing a dysplastic kidney. Despite technical refinements and an increase in clinical practice, a small percentage of viable testes may be missed with laparoscopic findings consistent with absent/vanished inguinal testis. Therefore, inguinal exploration is mandatory in all these cases.
