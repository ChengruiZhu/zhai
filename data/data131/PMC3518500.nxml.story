Antigen-specific immune responses against peptides derived from missense gene mutations have been identified in multiple cancers. The application of personalized peptide vaccines based on the tumor mutation repertoire of each cancer patient is a near-term clinical reality. These peptides can be identified for pre-validation by leveraging the results of massive gene sequencing efforts in cancer. In this study, we utilized NetMHC 3.2 to predict nanomolar peptide binding affinity to 57 human HLA-A and B alleles. All peptides were derived from 5,685 missense mutations in 312 genes annotated as functionally relevant in the Cancer Genome Project. Of the 26,672,189 potential 8â€“11 mer peptide-HLA pairs evaluated, 0.4% (127,800) display binding affinities < 50 nM, predicting high affinity interactions. These peptides can be segregated into two groups based on the binding affinity to HLA proteins relative to germline-encoded sequences: peptides for which both the mutant and wild-type forms are high affinity binders, and peptides for which only the mutant form is a high affinity binder. Current evidence directs the attention to mutations that increase HLA binding affinity, as compared with cognate wild-type peptide sequences, as these potentially are more relevant for vaccine development from a clinical perspective. Our analysis generated a database including all predicted HLA binding peptides and the corresponding change in binding affinity as a result of point mutations. Our study constitutes a broad foundation for the development of personalized peptide vaccines that hone-in on functionally relevant targets in multiple cancers in individuals with diverse HLA haplotypes.
