The invention and application of high-throughput technologies for DNA sequencing have resulted in an increasing abundance of biological sequence data. DNA or protein sequence data are naturally arranged as discrete linear sequences, and one of the fundamental challenges of analysis of sequence data is the description of how those sequences are arranged. Individual sites may be very sequentially heterogeneous or highly clustered into more homogeneous regions. However, progress in addressing this challenge has been hampered by a lack of suitable methods to accurately identify clustering of similar sites when there is no a priori specification of anticipated cluster size or count. Here, we present an algorithm that addresses this challenge, demonstrate its effectiveness with simulated data, and apply it to an example of genetic polymorphism data. Our algorithm requires no a priori knowledge and exhibits greater power than any other unsupervised algorithms. Furthermore, we apply model averaging methodology to overcome the natural and extensive uncertainty in cluster borders, facilitating estimation of a realistic profile of sequence heterogeneity and clustering. These profiles are of broad utility for computational analyses or visualizations of heterogeneity in discrete linear sequences, an enterprise of rapidly increasing importance given the diminishing costs of nucleic acid sequencing.
