Biomedical knowledge is complex and in constant evolution and growth, making it difficult for researchers to keep up with novel discoveries. Ontologies have become essential to help with this issue since they provide a standardized format to describe knowledge that facilitates its storing, sharing and computational analysis. However, the effort to keep a biomedical ontology up-to-date is a demanding and costly task involving several experts. Much of this effort is dedicated to the addition of new elements to extend the ontology to cover new areas of knowledge. We have developed an automated methodology to identify areas of the ontology that need extension based on past versions of the ontology as well as external data such as references in scientific literature and ontology usage. This can be a valuable help to semi-automated ontology extension systems, since they can focus on the subdomains of the identified ontology areas thus reducing the amount of information to process, which in turn releases ontology developers to focus on more complex ontology evolution tasks. By contributing to a faster rate of ontology evolution, we hope to positively impact ontology-based applications such as natural language processing, computer reasoning, information integration or semantic querying of heterogenous data.
