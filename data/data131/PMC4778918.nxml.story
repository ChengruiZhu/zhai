The pentameric ligand-gated ion channels constitute a large family of membrane proteins that are expressed in animals and certain bacteria. Their molecular architecture and function is conserved throughout the family. In mammals, they operate as receptors of the neurotransmitters acetylcholine, serotonin, GABA, and glycine and play a key role in electrical signal transduction at chemical synapses. These receptors are called ionotropic because they open a selective ion conduction path across the membrane upon binding of the neurotransmitters to a site that is exposed to the extracellular medium. Ligand binding promotes a conformational change in the extracellular domain that is transmitted over more than 50 Ã… to the pore domain. Due to this long-range effect, pentameric ligand-gated ion channels have become important model systems for the study of allosteric processes, a mechanism that is of large importance for biology and entails the regulation of a protein activity by an effector that binds to a distant domain. In the present study, we investigated the role that residues in the contact region between the ligand-binding and the pore domains of two bacterial pentameric ligand-gated ion channels of known structure have in the transduction of conformational changes. Our study shows that single mutations severely influence the functional properties, with certain mutations preventing activation. The results underline the importance of highly conserved residues in the domain interface for the transmission of allosteric signals and thus likely apply also to other family members.
