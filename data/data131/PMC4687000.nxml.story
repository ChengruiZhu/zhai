When defectors appear in a population of cooperators due to mutation or migration, defectors should become more common because they exploit the resource provided by cooperators without making a fair contribution to its production. The environmental degradation caused by defectors eventually leads to population collapse, and should result in the extinction of cooperators and defectors alike. By explicitly tracking all individuals in a spatially-structured environment where they can migrate to different locations, we find that cooperation can survive due to under-appreciated consequences of defector-induced population collapse. Population collapse creates vacant territories which can support the growth of cooperator but not defector migrants. This leads to the counterintuitive result that cooperation sometimes survives better when defectors are initially present compared to when they are initially absent. When defectors are initially present, the emergence of mutants best adapted to defector-degraded environments can also promote cooperation. Thus, by reducing population size through physiological and evolutionary mechanisms, defectors create “built in” mechanisms that protect cooperation from defectors. This may help explain the near ubiquity of cooperation despite its inherent vulnerability.
