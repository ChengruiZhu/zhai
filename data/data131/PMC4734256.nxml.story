Testicular seminoma is a common malignancy, accounting for 35â€“50% of testicular tumors. Comprehensive therapies lead to good curative efficacy. However, the factors that affect prognosis remain to be elucidated. The aim of the present study was to analyze the 3-, 5- and 10-year survival rate of patients with testicular seminoma as well as the associated factors of prognosis. The clinical data from 58 patients diagnosed with testicular seminoma were collected betweeen January 1999 and January 2014. The survival rate for this group was evaluated using the Kaplan-Meier method. Associated factors of prognosis were analyzed using the log-rank test. The results showed that approximately 62.1% of the cases were in the 30- to 50-year age group. From this age group, 94.8% of patients survived for 3 years, 86.2% for 5 years and 70.7% for 10 years. A significant difference was identified for the different clinical stages, pathological types and postoperative treatment in the 3-, 5- and 10-year survival rates (P<0.05). In conclusion, the clinical stages, pathological types and postoperative treatments significantly affect the prognosis of testicular seminoma. Selection of an appropriate method of treatment including the clinical stages and histological types, is the key element in testicular seminoma therapy.
