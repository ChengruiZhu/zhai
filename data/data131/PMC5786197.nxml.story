, 2.5% grade). Each bout was separated by a 5-min recovery period. RPE responses were simultaneously estimated by an observer and self-estimated by the participant during each bout using the Adult OMNI Walk-Run Scale. Session RPE responses were simultaneously estimated by the same observer and self-estimated by the participant 5-min post-exercise session. Analysis of variance indicated no significant mean differences between observer RPE and participant RPE (p > 0.05) except for males during the running bout (p < 0.05). Additionally, there were no significant mean differences between the observer RPE and the participant RPE for the session ratings (p > 0.05). Finally, strong positive correlations were found between observer and participant RPE ranging from 0.79–0.84 for exercise bouts and moderate-strong positive correlations ranging from 0.58–0.64 for the exercise session. Results support the use of the OMNI RPE Scale in a direct observation procedure to estimate exertion in female and male young adults performing intermittent treadmill walking and running. This observation-based procedure provides the practitioner with an opportunity to independently evaluate the perceptual intensity of individuals involved in aerobic exercise.
