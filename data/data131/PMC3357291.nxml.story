The paraventricular nucleus (PVN) of the hypothalamus controls the autonomic neural output to the liver, thereby participating in the regulation of hepatic glucose production (HGP); nevertheless, mechanisms controlling the activity of liver-related PVN neurons are not known. Transient receptor potential vanilloid type 1 (TRPV1) is involved in glucose homeostasis and colocalizes with liver-related PVN neurons; however, the functional role of TRPV1 regarding liver-related PVN neurons has to be elucidated. A retrograde viral tracer was used to identify liver-related neurons within the brain-liver circuit in control, type 1 diabetic, and insulin-treated mice. Our data indicate that TRPV1 regulates liver-related PVN neurons. This TRPV1-dependent excitation diminished in type 1 diabetic mice. In vivo and in vitro insulin restored TRPV1 activity in a phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/protein kinase Câ€“dependent manner and stimulated TRPV1 receptor trafficking to the plasma membrane. There was no difference in total TRPV1 protein expression; however, increased phosphorylation of TRPV1 receptors was observed in type 1 diabetic mice. Our data demonstrate that TRPV1 plays a pivotal role in the regulation of liver-related PVN neurons. Moreover, TRPV1-dependent excitation of liver-related PVN neurons diminishes in type 1 diabetes, thus indicating that the brain-liver autonomic circuitry is altered in type 1 diabetes and may contribute to the autonomic dysfunction of HGP.
