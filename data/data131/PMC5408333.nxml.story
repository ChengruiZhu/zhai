-dimethylamino)pyridine (DMAP)
mediates efficient aerobic oxidation of alcohols. Mechanistic study
of this reaction shows that the catalyst undergoes an in situ oxidative
self-processing step, resulting in conversion of DBED into a nitroxyl
that serves as an efficient cocatalyst for aerobic alcohol oxidation.
Insights into this behavior are gained from kinetic studies, which
reveal an induction period at the beginning of the reaction that correlates
with the oxidative self-processing step, EPR spectroscopic analysis
of the catalytic reaction mixture, which shows the buildup of the
organic nitroxyl species during steady state turnover, and independent
synthesis of oxygenated DBED derivatives, which are shown to serve
as effective cocatalysts and eliminate the induction period in the
reaction. The overall mechanism bears considerable resemblance to
enzymatic reactivity. Most notable is the “oxygenase”-type
self-processing step that mirrors generation of catalytic cofactors
in enzymes via post-translational modification of amino acid side
chains. This higher-order function within a synthetic catalyst system
presents new opportunities for the discovery and development of biomimetic
catalysts.
