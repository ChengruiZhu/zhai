Fifteen women and 19 men underwent the open procedure with a mean age of 47.1 years (6.7) and 13 women and 21 men were in the arthroscopic group with a mean age of 45.0 (6.9). No pre-surgery differences were found between groups based on age, sex, DASH or VAS scores. Both groups demonstrated a significant improvement in subjective measures and grip strength by 12-months post-surgery, and no significant differences were found between groups at any time point. The DASH, our primary outcome, decreased from a mean (SD) of 47.5 (14.5) pre-surgery to 21.9 (21.8) at 12-months post-surgery in the Open group and from 52.7 (16.0) to 22.6 (21.1) in the Arthroscopic group. VAS-pain scores (%) decreased in the Open group from 62.5 (17.2) pre-operatively to 30.0 (26.5) at 12-months. In the arthroscopic group, scores decreased from 63.7 (15.9) to 26.2 (24.6). Grip strength (kg) increased on the affected side from 23.6 (14.9) to 29.3 (16.3) and 21.4 (15.4) to 29.8 (15.4) for Open and Arthroscopic groups, respectively. The number of participants to reach the minimum clinically significant change did not differ between groups, 17 in the open group and 19 in the arthroscopic group. Ten in each group did not reach this threshold. Based on post hoc regression analysis, no factors (age, gender, WCB status, or smoking status) were found to be significant predictors of DASH or VAS outcome at 12-months post-surgery. However, this study was not adequately powered to draw any specific conclusions in this regard. The only significant difference between study groups was that the arthroscopic technique resulted in longer surgery time, 34.0 versus 22.5 minutes (p=0.005).
