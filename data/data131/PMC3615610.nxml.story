Connexin-43, a major gap junction protein, and cytokeratin-19, one of the intermediate filament keratins, are known to be markers of well-differentiated epithelium. In this study, we investigated the expression of these markers in the head region, lungs, and abdominal organs of 10 human mid-term fetuses. The expression of connexin-43 was found to be restricted to the dura mater, kidney, and adrenal cortex. In the kidney, we found a clear site-dependent difference in the expression pattern of these markers: connexin-43 expression was observed in the tubules of the renal cortex whereas cytokeratin-19 was strongly expressed in the collecting ducts and renal pelvis. This difference remained unchanged throughout the fetal stages examined. Immunoreactivity was not observed for either of the markers in the intrarenal vessels, including the glomeruli, and mesangial cells. Connexin-43 expression seemed to be restricted to the metanephric vesicle-derived structures that differentiate in the urogenital ridge of the splanchnic mesoderm. The adrenal cortex also originates from the same para-aortic mesoderm. In contrast, in the urogenital organs, cytokeratin-19 seemed to be expressed in ducts derived from the urogenital sinus.
