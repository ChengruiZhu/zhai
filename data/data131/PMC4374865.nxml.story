Genome-wide analysis of human populations is useful in shedding light on the evolutionary history of the human genome, with a wide range of applications from reconstructing past associations between different population histories to disease mapping. In this manuscript we report on the application of genome-wide data to southern African populations and the identification of genome-wide signatures of selection pre- and post-admixture. Several signals of selection, before and after admixture, were identified, some of which involved loci associated with human diseases, including malaria, influenza, tuberculosis and HIV/AIDS. These results may reflect adaptations of southern African populations to infectious diseases. Consistent with previous studies, this study highlights the significance of the San in the genetics of human populations, as they are distinct from the other populations in many respects i.e. haplotype structure, locations of recombination hotspots, copy number and population structure. Furthermore, our study demonstrates the admixture of the San, Bantu-speaking populations and populations of Eurasian ancestry in some of the southern and eastern African populations. It illustrates the value in correcting for this stratification in future genome-wide association studies, and suggests that a future admixture mapping in these populations would likely be warranted and successful.
