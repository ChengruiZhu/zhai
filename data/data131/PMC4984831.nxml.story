Primary bone lymphoma is a rare and peculiar extranodal presentation of non-Hodgkinâ€™s lymphoma, which threatens human health. It can be defined as a lymphoma that occurs in the bone, consisting of a single bone lesion with or without regional lymphadenopathies, and its underlying causes are largely unknown. In this case report, we describe a male who presented with left-sided distal forearm pain, swelling of 2 months duration, and progressive limited wrist motion for about 1 month. The patient had no significant medical history except diabetes. Magnetic Resonance Imaging demonstrated a sheet-like bone destruction area in the left-sided radius, localized discontinuous bone cortex, and adjacent soft tissue masses. Finally, a bone biopsy examined by histopathological and immunochemical methods confirmed a diagnosis of primary bone diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. Due to the rarity of this disease, the level of evidence supporting some diagnostic and therapeutic decisions remains low, and therefore, the details of the rare case may facilitate treatment of similar diseases and provide insight about this obscure lymphoproliferative malignancy. Also, related recent literature reports of primary bone lymphoma are reviewed.
