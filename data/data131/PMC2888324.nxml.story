Sepsis is a complex syndrome with its wide spectrum of severity, and is one of the most common causes of death in Critical Care Units. The Surviving Sepsis campaign launched in 2004, is aimed at improving diagnosis, management and survival of patients with sepsis. Care bundles are a group of best evidence based interventions which when instituted together, gives maximum outcome benefit. Care Bundles are simple, uniform and have universal practical applicability. Surviving Sepsis campaign guidelines in 2008 incorporated two sepsis care bundles. The Resuscitation bundle includes seven key interventions to be achieved in 6-h while four interventions have to be completed within 24-h in the Management bundle. Compliance with a bundle implies achieving all the specified goals in that bundle. Limitations to care bundles include the quality of the evidence on which they are based, and that the relative contributions of each element of the bundle are not known. Several observational studies support the hypothesis that sepsis care bundles have an important role in improving outcomes from sepsis. Critical Care Units should develop management strategies to ensure compliance with the sepsis bundles in order to decrease hospital mortality due to severe sepsis.
