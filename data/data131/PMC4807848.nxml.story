Individual cells must have the capability for rapid morphological transformations under various physiological conditions. One of the most drastic shape transformations occurs during the transition from spread to rounded morphologies. When this transition occurs rapidly, there is insufficient time for significant changes in surface area to occur, although the final size of the rounded cell indicates a significant reduction in apparent cell surface area at light microscope resolution. By contrast, high-resolution scanning electron micrographs of rapidly rounded cells reveal that a large amount of surface area is stored in a highly convoluted surface morphology consisting of bleb-like protrusions (BLiPs) and other small structures that are unrecognizable at lower resolution. This surface reserve is an important part of the mechanism that allows rapid and efficient large scale transformations of cell shape. Remarkably, although this convoluted morphology has been observed for decades, there has been very little effort recognizing and including this surface surplus in mathematical modeling of cell morphology and physiology. In this paper, we develop three complementary models to fill this void and lay the foundation for future investigations of the mechanisms that drive cellular morphological dynamics.
