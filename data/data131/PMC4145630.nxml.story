 SS35. Optimization has been carried out in two stages using statistical experimental design, viz. medium optimization and optimization of fermentation parameters. For medium optimization, Plackett–Burman design followed by central composite design (CCD) was used, while for optimization of fermentation parameters one-variable-at-a-time method followed by CCD was used. Carbon and nitrogen sources in the medium have been revealed to be the significant factors for enzyme production (carboxymethylcellulose 18.05 g/L; yeast extract 8 g/L and peptone 2 g/L). The inorganic salts have been found to be insignificant components of medium. Optimum fermentation parameters for optimized medium were: initial medium pH 5.65, incubation temperature = 40 °C, shaking speed = 120 rpm, and inoculum size = 6.96 %, v/v. Interestingly, the influence of all four parameters was almost independent with no interlinks. Secondly, the overall effect of all parameters was also low, as indicated by linear, square and interaction regression coefficients that were at least one order of magnitude lower than the intercept in the model equation. These results essentially meant that medium components dominate overall enzyme production process in comparison to fermentation parameters.
