An RNA molecule is made up of a linear sequence of nucleotides, which form pairwise interactions that define its folded three-dimensional structure; the particular structure largely depends on the specific sequence. These base-pairing interactions are stabilizing, and the RNA will tend to fold in a particular way to maximize stability. Consider some nucleotide sequence that optimally folds into some structure in isolation; if this sequence is now embedded inside a larger sequence, then either the original structure will be a robust subcomponent of the larger folded structure, or it will be disrupted due to new interactions between the original sequence and the surrounding sequence. We explore this property of context robustness of structure and in particular define the property of “self containment” to describe intrinsic context robustness—i.e., the tendency for certain sequences to be structurally robust in many different sequence contexts. Self containment turns out to be a strong characteristic of a class of RNAs called microRNAs, whose biogenesis process depends on the maintenance of structural robustness. This finding will be useful in future efforts to characterize novel miRNAs, as well as in understanding the regulation and evolution of noncoding functional RNAs as modular units.
