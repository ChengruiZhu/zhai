John, your greengrocer, arranges apples and oranges in order of price. Being on a budget, you choose the fruit to the left, because it is always cheaper. Last week it was apples; this week it's oranges. Your ability to choose the fruit on the left, be it apples or oranges, is an example of systematicity: a property of human cognition whereby having some cognitive abilities means having certain others. Explaining why cognitive ability is organized this way is a basic question for cognitive science. Cognitive scientists generally agree that systematicity depends on some form of structured representations. However, they have been unable to provide a complete answer without relying on some overly strong assumptions about the nature of these representations. We provide an alternative explanation, using a mathematical theory of structure called Category Theory. Our previous work dealt with a special case, where ability extends to all possible combinations of constituents. Some domains (e.g., aspects of language) are only quasi-systematic: capacity extends to some but not all possible combinations. The current work presents our more general theory of (quasi-)systematicity, which includes our previous explanation as a special case.
