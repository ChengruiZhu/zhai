We develop two Feldkamp-type reconstruction algorithms with no backprojection weight for circular and helical trajectory with planar detector geometry. Advances in solid-state electronic detector technologies lend importance to CT systems with the equispaced linear array, the planar (flat panel) detectors, and the corresponding algorithms. We derive two exact Hilbert filtered backprojection (FBP) reconstruction algorithms with no backprojection weight for 2D fan-beam equispace linear array detector geometry (complement of the equi-angular curved array detector). Based on these algorithms, the Feldkamp-type algorithms with no backprojection weight for 3D reconstruction are developed using the standard heuristic extension of the divergent beam FBP algorithm. The simulation results show that the axial intensity drop in the reconstructed image using the FDK algorithms with no backprojection weight with circular trajectory is similar to that obtained by using Hu's and T-FDK, algorithms. Further, we present efficient algorithms to reduce the axial intensity drop encountered in the standard FDK reconstructions in circular cone-beam CT. The proposed algorithms consist of mainly two steps: reconstruction of the object using FDK algorithm with no backprojection weight and estimation of the missing term. The efficient algorithms are compared with the FDK algorithm, Hu's algorithm, T-FDK, and Zhu et al.'s algorithm in terms of axial intensity drop and noise. Simulation shows that the efficient algorithms give similar performance in axial intensity drop as that of Zhu et al.'s algorithm while one of the efficient algorithms outperforms Zhu et al.'s algorithm in terms of computational complexity.
