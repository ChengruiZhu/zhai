During cell division, chromosomes must be distributed accurately to daughter cells to protect against aneuploidy, a state in which cells have too few or too many chromosomes, and which is associated with diseases such as cancer and birth defects. This process begins with the generation of an exact copy of each chromosome and the establishment of tight linkages that hold the newly duplicated sister chromosomes together. These linkages, generated by the cohesin complex, are essential to resist the pulling forces of the spindle, which will pull the sister chromosomes apart into the two new daughter cells. Here we examine the establishment of cohesin at the pericentromere, the region surrounding the site of spindle attachment and where its forces are strongest. We find that a dedicated pathway promotes cohesin establishment in this region through a two-step mechanism. In the first step, a group of proteins, known as the Ctf19 complex, promote the association of cohesin with this region. In the second step, the Csm3 protein, which is coupled to the DNA replication machinery, ensures its conversion into functional linkages. We demonstrate the importance of this process for accurate chromosome segregation during cell division.
