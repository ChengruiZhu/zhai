Brain development is a dynamic and complex process that requires highly orchestrated interaction between neural stem cells. Therefore, investigating these dynamics is fundamental for understanding brain development and disease. However, difficulties to record and quantify neural stem cells behavior inside the brain pose a major limitation. We were recently able to mimic brain development in the Petri dish by generating highly organized multicellular structures containing human neural stem cells termed Neural Rosettes. Here we present a newly developed method to record, quantify and analyze the dynamic movements of neural stem cells within rosettes as reflection of their behavior inside the developing brain. We first confirmed that neural stem cells move radially in rosettes similarly to authentic stem cells residing in the developing brain. We then defined novel measures to assess how well these neural stem cells organize into rosettes in culture and found that organization decreases as stem cells progress in culture. Finally, we demonstrated that disruption of rosette structures by specific drugs impairs organization dynamics of neural stem cells. Our findings offer a first insight into neural stem cell dynamics during brain development, and a potential methodology for functional studies and drug discovery.
