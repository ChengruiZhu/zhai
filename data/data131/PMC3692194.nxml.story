The congenital granular cell epulis (CGCE) is a rare tumor, which is apparent at birth. The histogenesis is still uncertain, but several theories, including origin from epithelial, undifferentiated mesenchymal cells, pericytes, fibroblasts, smooth muscle cells, and nerve-related cells have been proposed. This case report describes management of a 2-day-old baby girl having a large, round, soft, single 3 Ã— 4 cm, pedunculated swelling, on the lower anterior ridge, which was causing difficulty in feeding. Clinical diagnosis of congenital epulis (CE) was made and lesion was excised under conscious sedation. A vessel running over the surface of the lesion was continuous on the alveolar ridge. To reduce intra-operative hemorrhage transfixion suture was passed around the vessel on the alveolar ridge. Then the lesion was excised from the base of peduncle with a scalpel. Histopathologically, the diagnosis of a congenital granular cell lesion of the jaw was given. Follow up of 3 months shows no signs of recurrence. CGCE may interfere with feeding, requiring a conservative excision as soon as the child is fit to undergo surgery. Tendency for recurrence and malignant transformation has not been documented.
