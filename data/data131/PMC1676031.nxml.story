A large variety of cellular processes, such as the formation of filopodia or transport vesicles, require that large protein complexes are precisely positioned on intracellular membranes to execute a specific task and then are promptly disassembled to perform their function elsewhere. Small GTPases play a major role in the spatiotemporal control of these complexes. Their function is based on the unique property of cycling between the active GTP-bound state, in which they enable complex formation, and the inactive GDP-bound state, which promotes complex dissolution. Recent experiments based on fluorescence recovery after photobleaching have found that some small GTPases rapidly cycle within protein complexes, causing continuous release and recruitment of the complex components. The seemingly futile cycling is accompanied by a large excess of the active form. This puzzling behavior challenges one's intuition and calls for the application of quantitative methods. Here, Goryachev and Pokhilko use computational modeling to identify regulatory mechanisms that could enable GTPases to cycle with the experimentally observed frequency and efficiency. They show that to achieve high activity and turnover simultaneously, the concentrations of the regulatory molecules that control GTPase cycling should be tightly maintained within the optimal range.
