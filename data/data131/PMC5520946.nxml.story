Peroxiredoxin (Prdx) 2 is an antioxidant protein that utilizes its redox-sensitive cysteine groups to reduce hydrogen peroxide molecules and protect cells against oxidative damage from reactive oxygen species (ROS). However, its function in trophoblasts at the maternalâ€“fetal interface has not been clarified yet. In this study, significantly lower Prdx2 expression was found in the first-trimester villous cytotrophoblasts of patients with recurrent miscarriage (RM) than in cytotrophoblasts from healthy controls. Further, Prdx2 knockdown inhibited proliferation and increased apoptosis of trophoblast cells. The reason for this may be an increase in the level of cellular ROS after knockdown of Prdx2, which may subsequently lead to an increase in the expression of phosphorylated p53 (p-p53) and p38-MAPK/p21. Prdx2 knockdown also impaired the fusion of BeWo cells induced by forskolin. Bioinformatics analysis identified a c-Myc-binding site in the Prdx2 promoter region, and chromatin immunoprecipitation verified that c-Myc directly bound to a site in this locus. Suppression and overexpression of c-Myc resulted in reduction and increase of Prdx2 expression respectively. Furthermore, we demonstrated that c-Myc was downregulated in the first-trimester cytotrophoblasts of patients with RM, and its downregulation is also related with inhibited cell proliferation, increased apoptosis, as well as upregulated p21 expression and p-p53/p53 ratio. Our findings indicate that Prdx2 might have an important role in the regulation of trophoblast proliferation and apoptosis during early pregnancy, and that its expression is mediated by c-Myc. Thus, these two proteins may be involved in the pathogenesis of RM and may represent potential therapeutic targets.
