Eukaryotic genomes have been reshaped by chromosomal rearrangements during evolution. However, the comparison of distantly related species has uncovered unusually large genomic regions with conserved gene organization. A widely accepted explanation is that, in those regions, there exist genes with joint and/or intricate regulation, which, if altered, might affect the performance of the carriers. We used a system that allowed us to precisely disrupt one of the largest genomic regions that has been conserved in the fruit flies since âˆ¼63 million years ago and performed a variety of assays devised to detect differences in organismal performance and anomalous gene expression. Despite the overrepresentation of genes with expression profiles related to male fertility and detection of chemical stimuli in this genomic region, as well as the presence of genes expressed during development and putatively regulated by long distantly located sequences, we do not find evidence of diminished viability and fertility or of anomalous levels of expression. These results lead us to propose that regulatory constraints might not suffice to explain the maintenance of the integrity of some of the best candidate regions in one of the most dynamic eukaryotic genomes.
