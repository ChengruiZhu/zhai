This study aims to explore the role of the SDF-1/CXCR4 axis in mediating BMSCs and SCI recovery. BMSCs were collected and SCI rat models were established. Wistar rats were assigned into the blank control, sham, SCI, SCI + BMSCs, SCI + BMSCs + SDF-1, SCI + BMSCs + AMD3100 (an inhibitor of SDF-1/CXCR4 axis) and SCI + BMSCs + SDF-1 + AMD3100 groups. Hind limb motor function was measured 7, 14, 21 and 28 days after operation. qRT-PCR, western blotting and ELISA was performed to determine the expressions of SDF-1, CXCR4, NGF, BDNF, GFAP and GAP-43, TNF-α, IL-1β, L-6 and IFN-γ. Hind limb motor function scores 7 days after the operation were reduced in the SCI rats of the blank control and sham groups. Hind limb function was found to be better in the SCI + BMSCs and SCI + BMSCs + SDF-1 groups than in the SCI, SCI + BMSCs + AMD3100 and SCI + BMSCs + SDF-1 + AMD3100 groups 14, 21 and 28 days after operation. Furthermore, the SCI group had lower SDF-1, CXCR4, NGF, BDNF and GAP-43 expressions but higher GFAP, TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-6 and IFN-γ than the blank control and sham groups 28 days after operation. While, the SCI + BMSCs, SCI + BMSCs + SDF-1 and SCI + BMSCs + SDF-1 + AMD3100 groups displayed opposite trends to the SCI and SCI + BMSCs + AMD3100 groups. In conclusion, SDF-1/CXCR4 axis promotes recovery after SCI by mediating BMSCs.
