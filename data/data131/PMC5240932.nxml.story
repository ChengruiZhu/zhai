. In response to high dietary zinc, HIZR-1 activates transcription of multiple genes that encode a network of proteins that store and detoxify excess zinc. Furthermore, our results suggest HIZR-1 itself is the high zinc sensor, since it directly binds zinc ions in the ligand-binding domain that regulates transcriptional activation. These findings advance the understanding of zinc homeostasis and nuclear receptor biology. Nuclear receptors were initially characterized as receptors for hormones such as estrogen, indicating complex animals use these transcription factors to monitor their internal environment. However, nuclear receptors are present in simple organisms that lack endocrine signaling, suggesting these transcription factors might have a primordial function in sensing the external environment. Our results identify a new class of nuclear receptor ligands, the inorganic ion zinc, and a new function for nuclear receptors in directly sensing levels of a nutrient. We speculate that nutrient homeostasis mediated by direct binding of nutrients to the ligand-binding domain is a primordial function of nuclear receptors, whereas endocrine signaling in complex animals mediated by direct binding of hormones to the ligand-binding domain is a derived function of nuclear receptors that appeared later in evolution.
