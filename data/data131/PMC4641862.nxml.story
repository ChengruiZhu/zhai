Pneumatosis intestinalis is a rare condition that affects 0.03% of the population. Pneumatosis cystoides intestinalis (PCI) is characterized by the presence of multiple gas-filled cysts in the intestinal wall and the submucosa and/or intestinal subserosa. It is usually a secondary finding caused by a wide variety of underlying gastrointestinal or extragastrointestinal diseases. Here, we present the case of a 47-year-old man who was referred to our gastroenterology department with a history suggestive of intermittent small bowel obstruction associated with abdominal pain. Abdominal computed tomography demonstrated PCI of the small bowel. The mesentery and branches of the superior mesenteric artery and superior mesenteric vein were twisted with minimal pneumoperitoneum. Exploratory laparotomy was performed, and demonstrated segmental small bowel PCI secondary to hypermobile mesentery. The affected segment of the ileum was resected, and jejunoileal anastomosis was performed. Here, we report a rare case of segmental PCI probably due to repeated twisting of hypermobile mesentery. The clinical and imaging features of this disorder may mimic those of visceral perforation or bowel ischemia. PCI can be a cause of severe abdominal pain that may require surgical intervention.
