In the interest of continuing structure-function studies, highly purified sodium channel preparations from the eel electroplax were incorporated into planar lipid bilayers in the presence of veratridine. This lipoglycoprotein originates from muscle-derived tissue and consists of a single polypeptide. In this study it is shown to have properties analogous to sodium channels from another muscle tissue (Garber, S. S., and C. Miller. 1987. Journal of General Physiology. 89:459-480), which have an additional protein subunit. However, significant qualitative and quantitative differences were noted. Comparison of veratridine-modified with batrachotoxin-modified eel sodium channels revealed common properties. Tetrodotoxin blocked the channels in a voltage-dependent manner indistinguishable from that found for batrachotoxin-modified channels. Veratridine-modified channels exhibited a range of single-channel conductance and subconductance states. The selectivity of the veratridine-modified sodium channels for sodium vs. potassium ranged from 6-8 in reversal potential measurements, while conductance ratios ranged from 12-15. This is similar to BTX-modified eel channels, though the latter show a predominant single-channel conductance twice as large. In contrast to batrachotoxin-modified channels, the fractional open times of these channels had a shallow voltage dependence which, however, was similar to that of the slow interaction between veratridine and sodium channels in voltage-clamped biological membranes. Implications for sodium channel structure are discussed.
