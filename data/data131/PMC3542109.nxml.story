Twenty-four ( mean ± SE; 24.0 ± 0.9 years; 180.5 ± 5.8 cm; 83.7 ± 0.5 kg) resistance-trained men completed 6 wks of periodized RT (3x/wk). Participants were assigned to one of two groups based upon maximal voluntary contraction of the quadriceps (Biodex) to lean mass (LM) ratio. Group 1 (n = 13; MIPS) consumed one serving of NO-Shotgun® (whey protein, casein protein, branched-chain amino acids, creatine, beta alanine, and caffeine) before each workout and one serving of NO-Synthesize® (whey protein, casein protein, branched-chain amino acids, creatine, and beta alanine; Vital Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Davie, FL) immediately after each workout and on non-RT days. Group 2 (n = 11; Placebo; PLA) consumed a flavor-matched isocaloric maltodextrin placebo. Serum insulin-like growth factor 1, human growth hormone, testosterone, body composition (DXA), circumferences, 1-repetition maximal strength (1RM) of the upper (chest press) and lower body (leg press), and anaerobic power (Wingate test) were assessed before and after the intervention. Statistical analysis included a 2 × 2 (group x time) ANOVA with repeated measures. Tukey LSD post hoc tests were used to examine pairwise differences. Significance was set at p < 0.05.
