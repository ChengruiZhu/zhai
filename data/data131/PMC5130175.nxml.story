Myelination is an important process that enables fast propagation of action potential along the axons. Schwann cells (SCs) are the specialized glial cells that ensure the ensheathment of the corresponding axons in the Peripheral Nervous System. In order to do so, SCs and axons need to communicate to organize the myelinating segments and the clustering of sodium channels at the nodes of Ranvier. We have investigated the early events of myelination in the zebrafish embryo. We here identify ndrg4 as a novel neuronal factor essential for sodium channel clustering at the nodes. Immuno-labeling analysis show defective vesicle patterning along the axons of ndrg4 mutants, while timelapse experiments monitoring the presence and the transport of these vesicles reveal a normal behavior. Molecular analysis unravels a novel function of ndrg4 in controlling the expression of the t-SNARE/NSF machinery required for vesicle docking and release. However, inhibiting specifically regulated synaptic vesicle release does not lead to sodium channel clustering defects. We thus propose that ndrg4 can regulate this process, at least partially, through its ability to regulate the expression of key components of the t-SNARE/NSF machinery, responsible for clustering of sodium channels along myelinated axons.
