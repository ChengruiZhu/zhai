Twenty-one patients with a mean age of 14.9 Â± 2.9 years completed the emotional trauma assessment and 52.2% of respondents were female. The most common concurrent injury was a meniscal tear (47.8%) and 9.5% of patients reported a prior ACL rupture and reconstruction. Regarding specialization, one-third of athletes played one sport only, 52.4% of athletes played multiple sports while focusing on one above the others, and 14.2% of athletes balanced their sports equally. Single-sport athletes scored significantly higher on the athletic identity questionnaire (single-sport mean 57.2; multi-sport mean 52.1; p = .02). The majority of patients experience traumatic symptoms in all three major categories as 86.4% endorsed avoidance symptoms, 81.8% admitted intrusion symptoms, and 81.8% admitted hyperarousal symptoms. Older athletes were significantly more likely to experience stronger emotionally traumatic symptoms (p = .03) as 16 - 21 year old athletes scored a mean of 62.6 on the Impact of Events Scale compared to 39.6 for 7 - 15 year old athletes. While male patients experienced stronger traumatic symptoms than female patients, the separation was not found to be statistically significant (male 50.2; female 43.6; p = .12).
