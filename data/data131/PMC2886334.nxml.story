Colorectal cancer continues to be an important public health concern, despite improvements in screening and better systemic chemotherapy. The integration of targeted therapies in the treatment of colon cancer has resulted in significant improvements in efficacy outcomes. Angiogenesis is important for tumor growth and metastasis and is an important target for new biological agents. Bevacizumab is a humanized recombinant antibody that prevents vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) receptor binding, and inhibits angiogenesis and tumor growth. The addition of bevacizumab to fluoropyrimidine-based chemotherapy, with or without irinotecan or oxaliplatin, in both the first- and second-line treatment of metastatic colorectal cancer, significantly increased median progression-free survival and overall survival in select randomized phase III studies. Ongoing studies are evaluating the role of bevacizumab in the adjuvant treatment of colon cancer. Common toxicities associated with bevacizumab include hypertension, bleeding episodes, and thrombotic events. This review will focus on the integration of bevacizumab in the treatment paradigm of colon cancer and the management of its side effects.
