Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBM) readjust their volumes after swelling in hypotonic media. This regulatory volume decrease (RVD) is associated with a loss of cellular K+ and is thought to be promoted by an increased permeability to this ion. In contrast, no change in volume was observed when K+ permeability of PBM in isotonic media was increased to comparable or higher levels using valinomycin. Moreover, valinomycin-induced 86Rb+ loss in K+-free medium was considerably slower than in K+-rich medium. These results suggest that anion conductance limits net salt loss in isotonic media. Direct measurements of relative conductance confirmed that in volume-static cells, anion conductance is lower than that of K+. In volume-regulating cells depolarization occurred presumably as a result of increased anion conductance. Accordingly, the efflux of 36Cl from PBM was markedly increased by hypotonic stress. Since both membrane potential and intracellular 36Cl concentration are reduced in hypotonically swollen cells, the increased efflux is probably due to a change in Cl- permeability. Anions and cations seem to move independently through the volume-induced pathways: the initial rate of 86Rb uptake in swollen cells was not affected by replacement of external Cl- by SO=4; conversely, 36Cl fluxes were unaffected by substitution of K+ by Na+. The data indicate that anion conductance is rate-determining in salt and water loss from PBM. An increase in anion conductance is suggested to be the critical step of RVD of human PBM.
