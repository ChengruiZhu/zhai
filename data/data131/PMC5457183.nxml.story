 (BTO) nanoparticles (NPs) were fabricated by electrospinning. Physicochemical properties, including fiber morphology, microstructure, composition, thermal stability, surface roughness, and surface wettability, of these fibrous scaffolds were studied. The dielectric properties of the scaffolds were evaluated. The results showed that the randomly oriented BTO/PLLA composite fibrous scaffolds had the highest dielectric permittivity of 1.19, which is of the same order of magnitude as the natural bone. The combined effects of fiber orientation and electrical activity on the osteogenic responses of bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BM-MSCs) were specifically investigated. Randomly oriented composite fibrous scaffolds significantly promoted polygonal spreading and encouraged early osteogenic differentiation in BM-MSCs, whereas aligned composite fibrous scaffolds promoted cell elongation and discouraged osteogenic differentiation. These results evidenced that randomly fiber orientation and biomimetic electric activity have combining effects on osteogenic differentiation of BM-MSCs. Our findings indicate that coupling effects of multi-physical properties should be paid more attention to mimic the microenvironment for enhancing osteogenic differentiation of BM-MSCs.
