The pluripotency transcription factor NANOG has been implicated in tumor development, and NANOG-expressing cancer cells manifest stem cell properties that sustain tumor homeostasis, mediate therapy resistance and fuel tumor progression. However, how NANOG converges on somatic circuitry to trigger oncogenic reprogramming remains obscure. We previously reported that inducible NANOG expression propels the emergence of aggressive castration-resistant prostate cancer phenotypes. Here we first show that endogenous NANOG is required for the growth of castration-resistant prostate cancer xenografts. Genome-wide chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing coupled with biochemical assays unexpectedly reveals that NANOG co-occupies a distinctive proportion of androgen receptor/Forkhead box A1 genomic loci and physically interacts with androgen receptor and Forkhead box A1. Integrative analysis of chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing and time-resolved RNA sequencing demonstrates that NANOG dynamically alters androgen receptor/Forkhead box A1 signaling leading to both repression of androgen receptor-regulated pro-differentiation genes and induction of genes associated with cell cycle, stem cells, cell motility and castration resistance. Our studies reveal global molecular mechanisms whereby NANOG reprograms prostate cancer cells to a clinically relevant castration-resistant stem cell-like state driven by distinct NANOG-regulated gene clusters that correlate with patient survival. Thus, reprogramming factors such as NANOG may converge on and alter lineage-specific master transcription factors broadly in somatic cancers, thereby facilitating malignant disease progression and providing a novel route for therapeutic resistance.
