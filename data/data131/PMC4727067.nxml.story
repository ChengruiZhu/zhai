Heat shock proteins (HSPs) are involved in tumour immunity, and are correlated with survival and drug resistance in numerous types of cancer. The present study investigated the expression of HSPs and multiple drug resistance (MDR) in human chondrosarcoma. HSP and P-glycoprotein (the MDR1 gene product) expression was evaluated by immunohistochemical analysis of paraffin-embedded sections obtained from 37 patients with chondrosarcoma (19 male and 18 female; aged 33â€“85 years; mean age, 48.5 years). HSP73 and 90 were significantly overexpressed in patients with local recurrence: HSP73 was expressed in 7/7 patients (100%) with local recurrence and 9/18 patients (50%) without recurrence (P<0.02), while HSP90 was expressed in all patients with recurrence but only 8/18 (44%) without recurrence (P<0.02). A marked association was also identified between HSP expression and survival. HSP72 and 73 were significantly overexpressed in tumours from patients who succumbed to the disease (all positive for HSP72 and 73; P<0.05). No differences were observed between HSP27, 73 or 90-positive or -negative tumours according to age or gender. In addition, HSP72 expression was correlated with differentiation of the tumours (P<0.02). These results indicate that HSP72, 73 and 90 may function as novel prognostic markers for chondrosarcoma, and initiate further studies regarding the use of such markers for the identification of patients with poor prognosis.
