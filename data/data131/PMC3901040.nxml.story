Most dialysis patients were not up-to-date with both vaccinations. They were, however, more up-to-date with their influenza than their pneumococcal vaccination. Non-English speakers did not appear to be disadvantaged. GP electronic reminder systems may have influenced influenza uptake but this study did not demonstrate a correlation and this is likely due to the lack of GP respondents; the effectiveness of electronic reminders merits further studies as a tool to improve vaccination rates in at-risk populations. Most patients visited their GP at least annually but preferred to receive their vaccinations at the hospital. Vaccinating in the dialysis unit and maintaining an electronic record accessible to GPs or generating a letter for GPs may help fill the vaccination gap in these patients. Overall, more evidence is required for the effectiveness of such vaccinations and their frequency, but in the meantime UK national guidelines were not being followed with a large proportion of patients remaining unvaccinated against influenza and in particular pneumococcal disease. This audit highlights the importance of local data collection, discussions around correlations influencing outcomes and publication of results to improve standards of care at a national level.
