Six types of celiac axis anatomic variations were identified in our study. A total of 546 of the 600 patients had a normal celiac axis anatomy. Anatomic variations were seen in 5.5% of patients. Ambiguous anatomy was seen in 3.5% of the patients. CHA originated from celiac axis in 95.83% of the patients. Variations in anatomic origin of CHA were seen in 8 patients. Ambiguous dual pathway was seen in 4 patients. Normal Sp-preportal course of CHA was identified in 97.78% of cases, Sp-retroportal course in 7 patients, Tp-preportal course in 2, Tp-retroportal in 1, Ip-preportal in 1 and through Ligamentum venosum in 2 patients. Normal origin of RHA from HAP was seen in 79.6% patients. Replaced origin of RHA was seen in 15.16% cases and Accessory origin of RHA was seen in 5.16% cases. LHA originated from HAP in 81.5% patients. Replaced LHA origin was seen in 10.8% cases and Accessory LHA origin seen in 7.6% cases. MHA originated from RHA in 41.3% patients, LHA in 27.83% and from CHA in 4.5% cases. Origin of MHA could not be defined in 26.3% of patients. GDA originated from CHA in 97.6% of patients, from celiac axis in 1.6%, from RHA in 0.33% in patients. Trifurcation of CHA was seen in 7.16% and quadrifurcation of CHA in 2.16%.
