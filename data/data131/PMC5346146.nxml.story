, one of the most important edible macroalgae in Japan, were studied. Recruits were mainly generated by vegetative reproduction at the margins of filamentous holdfasts. They first appeared in late spring and peaked in summer as upright thalli of the previous generation withered. After producing recruits, holdfasts withered indicating that holdfasts were also annual, the same as upright thalli. All recruits produced main branches and became new upright thalli in early autumn. During this transitional period, the thallus density decreased due to the crowded conditions induced by simultaneous growth initiation. After this early mortality, however, thallus density remained almost constant over much of the growth season. Thallus growth continued during winter and the stand biomass peaked in spring. During this biomass accumulation, development of a thallus size hierarchy was moderate and no size-dependent mortality was observed. Main branch number per thallus was also constant until spring, indicating the main branches also persisted after being produced in early autumn. This lack of severe intraspecific competition both at a thallus and main branch level is supported by the ambient wave condition of the habitat which gives moderate undulation and enables light and nutrients to be supplied to each thallus, and allowed the
