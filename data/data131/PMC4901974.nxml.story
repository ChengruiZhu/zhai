A total of 100 knees (mean age±standard deviation 70±11 years) of 84 consecutive patients who have previously undergone primary TKA and complained about postoperative knee pain or stiffness after TKA were prospectively included. All patients underwent clinical and radiological examination including standardized radiographs and Tc-99m-HDP-SPECT/CT as part of a routine diagnostic algorithm. The diagnosis before and after SPECT/CT imaging, as well as the final treatment were recorded. Femoral and tibial TKA component position (varus-valgus, flexion-extension, internal rotation-external rotation) was determined on 3D reconstructed images using a customized analysis software. Intensity and anatomical distribution of 99mTc-HDP-SPECT/CT bone tracer uptake was determined using a validated localisation scheme. Maximum intensity values were recorded as well as ratios between the respective value and the background tracer activity (proximal mid-shaft of the femur). Level of significance was p<0.05. Univariate analysis (Chi square test, Pearson correlation, t-test for independent samples) was performed to identify any correlations between component position, tracer uptake and diagnosis. For all analysis, p<0.05 was considered statistically significant.
