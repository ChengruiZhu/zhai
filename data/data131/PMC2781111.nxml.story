Promiscuous proteins generally bind a large array of diverse ligand structures. This may be facilitated by a very large binding site, multiple binding sites, or a flexible binding site that can adjust to the size of the ligand. These aspects also increase the complexity of predicting whether a molecule will bind or not to such proteins which frequently function as exogenous compound sensors to respond to toxic stress. For example, transporters may prevent absorption of some molecules, and enzymes may convert them to more readily excretable compounds (or alternatively activate them prior to further clearance by other detoxification enzymes). Nuclear hormone receptors may respond to ligands and then affect downstream gene expression to upregulate both enzymes and transporters to increase the clearance for the same or different molecules. We have assessed the ability of many different ligand-based and structure-based computational approaches to model and predict the activation of human PXR by steroidal compounds. We find the most effective computational approach to identify potential steroidal PXR agonists which are clinically relevant due to their widespread use in clinical medicine and the presence of mimics in the environment.
