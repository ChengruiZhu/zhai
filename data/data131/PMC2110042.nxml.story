Sulfate incorporation into the guinea pig pancreas was investigated by light (LM) and electron microscope (EM) autoradiography using a system of minilobules incubated in vitro for 60 min in Krebs-Ringer bicarbonate medium (KRB) containing 35SO4(-2). In acinar cells, examined by EM autoradiography, the label was found concentrated over Golgi elements (including condensing vacuoles) and zymogen granules. 35SO4(-2) was also incorporated by the epithelial cells of the entire pancreatic duct system, the incorporation being surprisingly high in the epithelium of the major ducts. In all ductal epithelia, autoradiographic grains appeared over the Golgi complex and the plasmalemma. Since a contribution of duct epithelium to the sulfated compounds found in the discharged secretion could not be ruled out, a purified zymogen granule fraction was used as a source material for the isolation of sulfated compounds of acinar origin. The presence of 35S- radioactivity in the zymogen granules and condensing vacuoles of this fraction was ascertained by autoradiography (of sectioned pellets). From a lysate of this zymogen granule fraction, a soluble sulfated compound of low isoelectric point and high molecular weight was isolated by gel filtration under conditions that allowed its satisfactory separation from the bulk of the secretory proteins.
