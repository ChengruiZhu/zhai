Invasion of human tissues by the parasitic protozoan Entamoeba histolytica is a multistep process involving, as a first step, the recognition of surface molecules on target tissues by the amebas or trophozoites. This initial contact is followed by the release of proteolytic and other activities that lyse target cells and degrade the extracellular matrix. In other parasitic diseases, as well as in certain cancers, the interaction of invasive organisms or cells with fibronectin (FN) through specific receptors has been shown to be the initial step in target cell recognition. Interaction with FN triggers the release of proteolytic activities necessary for the effector cell migration and invasion. Here, we describe the specific interaction of Entamoeba histolytica trophozoites with FN, and identify a 37-kD membrane peptide as the putative receptor for FN. The interaction between the parasite and FN leads to a response reaction that includes the secretion of proteases that degrade the bound FN and the rearrangement of amebic actin into "adhesion plates" at sites of contact with FN-coated surfaces. The kinetics of the interaction was determined by measuring the binding of soluble 125I-FN to the trophozoites and visualization of the bound protein using specific antibodies. Degradation of FN was measured by gel electrophoresis and the release of radioactivity into the incubation medium. Focal degradation of FN was visualized as black spots under the trophozoites at contact sites with fluorescent FN. We conclude that the interaction of E. histolytica with FN occurs through a specific surface receptor. The interaction promotes amebic cytoskeleton changes and release of proteases from the parasite. The binding and degradation of extracellular matrix components may facilitate the migration and penetration of amebas into tissues, causing the lesions seen in human hosts.
