Chloride self-exchange across the human erythrocyte membrane at alkaline extracellular pH (pHO) and constant neutral intracellular pH (pH(i)) can be described by an exofacial deprotonatable reciprocating anion binding site model. The conversion of the transport system from the neutral to the alkaline state is related to deprotonation of a positively charged ionic strength- and substrate-sensitive group. In the absence of substrate ions ([ClO] = 0) the group has a pK of approximately 9.4 at constant high ionic strength (equivalent to approximately 150 mM KCl) and a pK of approximately 8.7 at approximately zero ionic strength. The alkaline ping-pong system (examined at constant high ionic strength) demonstrates outward recruitment of the binding sites with an asymmetry factor of approximately 0.2, as compared with the inward recruitment of the transport system at neutral pHO with an asymmetry factor of approximately 10. The intrinsic half-saturation constant for chloride binding, with [Cli] = [Clo], increased from approximately 30 mM at neutral to approximately 110 mM at alkaline pHO. The maximal transport rate was a factor of approximately 1.7 higher at alkaline pHO. This increase explains the stimulation of anion transport, the "modifier hump," observed at alkaline pHO. The translocation of anions at alkaline pHO was inhibited by deprotonation of another substrate- sensitive group with an intrinsic pK of approximately 11.3. This group together with the group with a pK of approximately 9.4 appear to form the essential part of the exofacial anion binding site. The effect of extracellular iodide inhibition on chloride transport as a function of pHO could, moreover, be simulated if three extracellular iodide binding constants were included in the model: namely, a competitive intrinsic iodide binding constant of approximately 1 mM in the neutral state, a self-inhibitor binding constant of approximately 120 mM in the neutral state, and a competitive intrinsic binding constant of approximately 38 mM in the alkaline state.
