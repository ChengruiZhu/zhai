Gastric cancer (GC) is one of the leading causes of cancer-related deaths worldwide and the disease outcome commonly depends upon the tumour stage at the time of diagnosis. However, this cancer can often be asymptomatic during the early stages and remain undetected until the later stages of tumour development, having a significant impact on patient prognosis. However, our comprehension of the mechanisms underlying the development of gastric malignancies is still lacking. For these reasons, the search for new diagnostic and prognostic markers for gastric cancer is an ongoing pursuit. Modern mass spectrometry imaging (MSI) techniques, in particular matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionisation (MALDI), have emerged as a plausible tool in clinical pathology as a whole. More specifically, MALDI-MSI is being increasingly employed in the study of gastric cancer and has already elucidated some important disease checkpoints that may help us to better understand the molecular mechanisms underpinning this aggressive cancer. Here we report the state of the art of MALDI-MSI approaches, ranging from sample preparation to statistical analysis, and provide a complete review of the key findings that have been reported in the literature thus far.
