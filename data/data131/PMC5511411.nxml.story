 or of the role of its thigmotropic stigma. Carefully designed manual pollination experiments along with critical field observations revealed naturally deposited pollen load to be too low to cause permanent closure of stigma lobes. A strong relationship exists between the threshold pollen load on stigma, its permanent closure and fertilization. Of the various pollination treatments undertaken, fruits were formed only in open and manual cross pollinations when ∼9200 pollen of legitimate type is deposited on the stigma. Thigmosensitivity further limited the opportunity for the deposition of optimum pollen loads. Although, frequented by as many as seven different visitors, an average of 8 bats per night are available for as many as 30 trees which reflects a baseline deficiency of effective pollinators. This limitation in pollen and pollinator availability affects pollination success of this species and ends up with low fruit set. Fluorescence microscopy reveals successful germination and tube growth of pollen grains of both self and cross type but fruit-set is 100 % in cross-pollinated pistils only. Despite slower rates of ovule penetration and evidence of delayed fertilization, absolutely no fruit initiation occurs in self-pollinated pistils. This strongly points towards self incompatibility being late acting.
