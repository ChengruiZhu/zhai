We subjected 48 of our samples from transcriptional clusters 1, 2, 3, and 5 to Infinium HumanMethylation450 arrays. Samples belonging to transcriptional clusters 1â€“3 still showed visible relationships to each other by methylation, but cluster 5, with known chromosomal abnormalities, no longer formed a cohesive group. Within transcriptional clusters 2 and 3, controlling for fetal sex and gestational age in the identification of differentially methylated sites, compared to the healthier cluster 1, dramatically reduced the number of significant sites, but increased the percentage that demonstrated a strong linear correlation with gene expression (from 5% and 2% to 9% and 8%, respectively). Locations exhibiting a positive relationship between methylation and gene expression were most frequently found in CpG open sea enhancer regions within the gene body, while those with a significant negative correlation were often annotated to the promoter in a CpG shore region. Integrated transcriptome and epigenome analysis revealed modifications in TGF-beta signaling, cell adhesion, oxidative phosphorylation, and metabolism pathways in cluster 2 placentas, and aberrations in antigen presentation, allograft rejection, and cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction in cluster 3 samples.
