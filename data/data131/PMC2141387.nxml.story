 1. All dyes appearing in gastric juice after intravenous injection in the dog are characterized by having their chromogen in the electropositive ion under suitable conditions. 2. All dyes eliminated in pancreatic juice ionize with the chromogen electronegative under proper circumstances. 3. The amphoteric characteristics of certain dyestuffs, as well as the changes in charge associated with reversible reduction in others, have been taken into consideration, and the lack of success of previous investigators in finding a common characteristic of dyes secreted by the gastric glands differentiating them from those secreted by the pancreas, has been shown to have been due to failure to take these potentialities of the dyestuffs into account. 4. Several possible hypotheses concerning the mechanism of selectivity to dyestuffs have been considered. Differences in distribution in acid, neutral, and alkaline phases will not account for selective secretion without postulating also specific membrane permeability. It is pointed out that the theory most thoroughly in accord with all the facts observed is based upon the pore concept. To restrain electronegative dyes by polar adsorption, the pores of the membranes of the gastric glands would have to be positively charged. Such pores would constitute an electrostatic filter, restraining from passage all mobile ions of the same charge. The anions, which in plasma are mostly chloride, could pass this barrier into the secretion. In order to have hydrochloric acid formation, anion exchange would have to occur, bicarbonate, lactate, or some other anion from the gland lumen returning to balance chloride entering, leaving the hydrogen ion from the weaker acid in the secretion. This tentative theory can also be seen to fit many of the facts of pancreatic secretion, where electropositive dyes are restrained, and alkali is secreted.
