A total of 110 session report cards, 24 questionnaires, 10 interviews and 16 hours of video recording were analysed. The responses from interviews and questionnaires were compared with the discourse analysis of the session video recordings and session report cards. A greater percentage of goals were completed in the Skype sessions. Whilst there were breaks in internet connection, this did not reduce the number of goals achieved. The ratio of turn moves and utterance functions were the same for therapist and child in both session formats; the only difference identified was the increased use of requests for objects/action in the F2F session. The discourse analysis supported the participant observations that the children worked harder and focused better in the Skype sessions. The presence of clarifications and the reduced numbers of interruptions were in line with other research observations that the speakers were able to judge the mood of the conversation partner in remote interaction. Costs of Skype SLT were lower than equivalent F2F sessions. The combination of positive findings suggests that Skype SLT sessions are potentially acceptable and are likely to have a useful role to play in service provision.
