As background for a serological definition of the unique antigens of chemically induced sarcomas, we have typed a series of fibroblast and sarcoma cell lines of BALB/c and C57BL/6 origin by cytoxicity and absorption tests for murine leukemia virus (MuLV)-related cell surface antigens and known alloantigens. 7 of the 17 cultured lines expressed the range of cell surface antigens associated with MuLV (GIX, GCSA, gp70, p30), and this was invariably associated with MuLV production. In nonproducer lines of C57BL/6 (but not BALB/c) origin, a MuLV-gp70-like molecule was found on the surface of fibroblasts and sarcoma cells. The alloantigenic phenotype of these MuLV+ and MuLV- cell lines was H-2D+, H-2K+, Thy-1.2+ or -, PC.1+ or -, Lyt-1.2-, Lyt-2.2-, Ia.7-, and TL.2-. A unique antigen was defined on the BALB/c ascites sarcoma Meth A with antisera prepared in BALB/c or (BALB/c X C57BL/6)F1 mice. Tissue culture lines derived from this tumor were MuLV-, which facilitated serological study of the antigen. Absorption analysis indicated that the antigen was restricted to Meth A; it could not be detected in normal or fetal BALB/c tissue MuLV+ or MuLV- fibroblast lines, 12 syngeneic or allogeneic sarcomas, or normal lymphoid cells from 13 different inbred mouse strains.
