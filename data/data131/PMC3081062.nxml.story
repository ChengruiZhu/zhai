Gli1 is an established oncogene and its expression in Estrogen Receptor (ER) α negative and triple negative breast cancers is predictive of a poor prognosis; however, the biological functions regulated by Gli1 in breast cancer have not been extensively evaluated. Herein, Gli1 was over-expressed or down-regulated (by RNA interference and by expression of the repressor form of Gli3) in the ERα negative, human breast cancer cell lines MDA-MB-231 and SUM1315. Reduced expression of Gli1 in these two cell lines resulted in a decrease in migration and invasion. Gli1 over-expression increased the migration and invasion of MDA-MB-231 cells with a corresponding increase in expression of MMP-11. Silencing MMP-11 in MDA-MB-231 cells that over-expressed Gli1 abrogated the Gli1-induced enhancement of migration and invasion. Sustained suppression of Gli1 expression decreased growth of MDA-MB-231 in vitro by increasing apoptosis and decreasing proliferation. In addition, silencing of Gli1 reduced the numbers and sizes of pulmonary metastases of MDA-MB-231 in an in vivo experimental metastasis assay. In summary, Gli1 promotes the growth, survival, migration, invasion and metastasis of ERα negative breast cancer. Additionally, MMP-11 is up-regulated by Gli1 and mediates the migration and invasion induced by Gli1 in MDA-MB-231.
