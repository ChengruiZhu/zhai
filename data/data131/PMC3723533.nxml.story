The sex-determining role of the human Y chromosome makes it male-specific, and always present in only a single copy. This solo lifestyle has endowed it with some bizarre features, among which are eight large DNA units constituting about a quarter of the chromosome's length, and containing many genes important for sperm production. These units are called palindromes, since, taking into account the polarity of the DNA strands, the sequence is the same read from either end of the unit. We investigated the details of a process (gene conversion) that transfers sequence variants in one half of a palindrome into the other, thereby maintaining >99.9% similarity between the halves. We analysed patterns of sequence variants within one palindrome in a set of Y chromosomes whose evolutionary relationships are known. This allowed us to identify past gene conversion events, and to demonstrate a bias towards events that eliminate new variants, and retain old ones. Gene conversion has therefore acted during human evolution to retard sequence change in these regions. Analysis of the chimpanzee and gorilla versions of the palindrome shows that the dynamic processes we see in human Y chromosomes have a deep evolutionary history.
