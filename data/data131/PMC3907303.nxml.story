An increasing amount of evidence demonstrates a close relation between inflammation and cancer development, which reveals the importance of the tumor microenvironment for the development of cancers. Recently, a molecular pathway linking inflammation to cell transformation, which is a prerequisite to cancer development, has been discovered. This molecular pathway is based on a positive inflammatory feedback loop between NF-ÎºB, Lin28, Let-7 microRNA and IL6, allowing the occurrence of an epigenetic switch leading to cell transformation. Here, we propose a computational model to account for the dynamics of this epigenetic switch. We show that an irreversible bistable switch is at the core of the dynamics of the system. The model further indicates that oncogenes (activators of the switch) and tumor suppressors (inhibitors of the switch) regulate the occurrence of cell transformation by modulating the threshold of inflammatory signal needed to induce the switch. Stochastic simulations of the model suggest that molecular fluctuations are able to trigger cell transformation, highlighting possible links between stochasticity and cancer development. Finally, the model predicts a crucial role of competing endogenous RNAs (ceRNAs) for the dynamics of the epigenetic switch and the occurrence of cell transformation.
