Cellular networks, such as metabolic and transcriptional regulatory networks (TRNs), do not operate independently but work together in unison to determine cellular phenotypes. Further, the phenotype and architecture of one network constrains the topology of other networks. Hence, it is critical to study network components and interactions in the context of the entire cell. Typically, efforts to reconstruct TRNs focus only on immediately proximal data such as gene co-expression and transcription factor (TF)-binding. Herein, we take a different strategy by linking candidate TRNs with the metabolic network to predict systems-level responses such as growth phenotypes of TF knockout strains, and compare predictions with experimental phenotype data to select amongst the candidate TRNs. Our approach goes beyond traditional data integration approaches for network inference and refinement by using a predictive network model (metabolism) to refine another network model (regulation) â€“ thus providing an alternative avenue to this area of research. Understanding how the networks function together in a cell will pave the way for synthetic biology and has a wide-range of applications in biotechnology, drug discovery and diagnostics. Further we demonstrate how metabolic models can integrate and reconcile inconsistencies across different data-types.
