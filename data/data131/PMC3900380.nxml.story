Before a cell divides, its genome must be faithfully duplicated to ensure that the daughter cell receives an exact copy of the parental genetic material. However, this process requires disruption of chromatin, the combination of DNA and histone proteins, whose structure and function have to be readily restored afterwards. This is achieved through a nuclear process known as DNA replication, which represents the basis for biological inheritance. In eukaryotes, genome replication starts from distinct genomic locations termed replication origins. Origins fire in a temporally regulated, cell-type dependent manner and timing of DNA replication is therefore the result of this concerted origin activation. However, replication timing is not encoded in the genome and its regulatory mode remains to a large degree unresolved. Here, we systematically study the relationship between chromatin, represented by histone modifications and chromatin binding proteins, and DNA replication timing. We report combinatorial histone modification patterns exhibiting regulatory potential for this process and we characterize those elements that might contribute to further elucidate the regulatory mode of this fundamental cellular process.
