 occupying a further interval before the growth acceleration appears. 2. The reaction time of the phototropic response of the sporangiophore following stimulation by unilateral illumination is also compound, and is made up of at least three components comparable to those of the direct growth response. 3. The reaction time of each mode of response is constant for a particular intensity of illumination, provided that the duration of the exposure period exceeds a certain value. Below that value the reaction time increases progressively as the exposure time decreases. 4. The reaction time of each mode of response is found to vary similarly as a function of the duration of exposure to light. It is therefore concluded that the two responses are based on the same light-sensitive system. This conclusion accords with the conception of plant phototropism developed by Blaauw. 5. If a constant representing the action-time is subtracted from the reaction times for either mode of response, the reciprocals of the resulting numbers follow a linear sequence when plotted against the durations of the exposure to light. The rate of the process occurring during the latent period is therefore considered to be directly proportional to the amount of preceding photochemical change.
