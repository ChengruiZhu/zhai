 model to differentiate embryonic stem (ES) cells simultaneously into mature neurons and endothelial cells. Murine ES cells are differentiated within an artificial environment composed of PA6 stromal cells and a serum-free medium. Upon these basal culture conditions ES cells preferentially differentiate into neurons. The addition of basic fibroblast growth factor (FGF2) to the medium allows the simultaneous maturation of neurons and endothelial cells, whereas bone morphogenetic protein (BMP)4 drives endothelial differentiation to the disadvantage of neural commitment. The responsiveness of the system to exogenous cytokines was confirmed by genes expression analysis that revealed a significant up-regulation of endothelial genes in presence of FGF2 and a massive down-regulation of the neural markers in response to BMP4. Furthermore, the role played by single genes in determining endothelial and neural fate can be easily explored by knocking down the expression of the target gene with lentiviruses carrying the corresponding shRNA sequence. The possibility to address the neural and the endothelial fate separately or simultaneously by exogenous stimuli combined with an efficient gene silencing strategy make this model an optimal tool to identify environmental signals and genes pathways involved in both endothelial and neural specification.
