Suppressor factor derived from three different murine T cell hybridomas were characterized . They specifically inhibited 4-hydroxy-3-nitrophenyl acetyl cutaneous sensitivity responses. The factors bind antigen and bear I-J and idiotypic determinants, but lack conventional immunoglobulin constant-region determinants. The factors function during the induction phase of the immune response, by inducing a second population of suppressor cells (Ts(e)). Suppressor factor can inhibit both cellular and plaque-forming cell responses in appropriate strains of mice. These hybridoma suppressor factors directly suppress strains of mice that are Igh-V homologous with the strain producing the factor. Thus, there is an apparent Igh-V restriction in the activity of these factors. However, this is a pseudogenetic restriction because these factors generate second order suppressor cells (Ts(e)) in Igh-incompatible mice, but in order to express the suppressive activity, the cells must be adoptively transferred into recipients that are Igh compatible with the strain producing the suppressor factor. Finally, it was shown that the factor-induced Ts(e) population is under an apparent dual genetic restriction. Thus, Igh and H-2 homology is required in order for the Ts(e) population to express its suppressive activity.
