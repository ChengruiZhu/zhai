Permanent implant of sealed radioactive sources is an effective technique for treating cancer. Typically, the radioactive sources are implanted in and near the disease, depositing radiation absorbed dose locally over several months. There may be instances where these patients must undergo unrelated surgical procedures when the radioactive material remains active enough to pose risks. This work explores these risks, discusses strategies to mitigate those risks, and describes a case study for a permanent iodine‐125 (I‐125) prostate brachytherapy implant patient who developed colorectal cancer and required surgery six months after brachytherapy. The first consideration is identifying the radiological risk to the patient and staff before, during, and after the surgical procedure. The second is identifying the risk the surgical procedure may have on the efficacy of the brachytherapy implant. Finally, there are considerations for controlling the radioactive substances from a regulatory perspective. After these risks are defined, strategies to mitigate those risks are considered. We summarize this experience with some guidelines: If the surgical procedure is near (e.g., within 5–10 cm of) the implant; and, the surgical intervention may dislodge sources enough to compromise treatment or introduces radiation safety risks; and, the radioactivity has not sufficiently decayed to background levels; and, the surgery cannot be postponed, then a detailed analysis of risk is advised.
