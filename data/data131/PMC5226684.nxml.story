 lives a complex and rich life despite having only 302 neurons. The full connectivity between these neurons (its “connectome”) has been measured, making it an ideal model system for understanding how neural processing generates behavior. However, unlike most animals, it doesn’t appear to have neural circuits dedicated to generating rhythmic motion. Even the simple rhythmic behavior of forward locomotion is believed to be ultimately driven by stretch-receptive proprioception as the worm changes body shape. Computational models of connectome dynamics can capture behavioral responses, making them valuable for studying neural dynamics. We consider a model of the full-connectome dynamics which, without external input, is in a static neural state. We show that proprioception-like input can bring the system into a rhythmic state similar to locomotion. We then show that arbitrary external inputs across all neurons can only excite some combination of six neural patterns, and that the shape and dynamics of these patterns are determined by the connectome. Furthermore, two of these patterns correspond to forward locomotion, such that the connectome facilitates locomotion-like responses. We thus find that the connectome itself is not random, but is ideally tuned for generating behavior.
