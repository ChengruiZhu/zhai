We analyzed a prospective cohort of consecutive ST‐segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) patients from a regional STEMI system with data on patient demographics, low‐density lipoprotein cholesterol levels, CVD risk factors, medication use, and outpatient visits over the 2 years prior to STEMI. We determined pre‐STEMI eligibility according to American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association guidelines and the prior Third Report of the Adult Treatment Panel guidelines. Our sample included 1062 patients with a mean age of 63.7 (13.0) years (72.5% male), and 761 (71.7%) did not have known CVD prior to STEMI. Only 62.5% and 19.3% of individuals with and without prior CVD were taking a statin before STEMI, respectively. In individuals not taking a statin, median (interquartile range) low‐density lipoprotein cholesterol levels in those with and without known CVD were low (108 [83, 138]  mg/dL and 110 [87, 133] mg/dL). For individuals not taking a statin, only 38.7% were statin eligible by ATP III guidelines. Conversely, 79.0% would have been statin eligible according to American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association guidelines. Less than half of individuals with (49.2%) and without (41.1%) prior CVD had seen a primary care provider during the 2 years prior to STEMI.
