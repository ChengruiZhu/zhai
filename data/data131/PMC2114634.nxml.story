Our goal was to determine the direction of force generation of the inner dynein arms in flagellar axonemes. We developed an efficient means of extracting the outer row of dynein arms in demembranated sperm tail axonemes, leaving the inner row of dynein arms structurally and functionally intact. Sperm tail axonemes depleted of outer arms beat at half the beat frequency of sperm tails with intact arms over a wide range of ATP concentrations. The isolated, outer arm-depleted axonemes were induced to undergo microtubule sliding in the presence of ATP and trypsin. Electron microscopic analysis of the relative direction of microtubule sliding (see Sale, W. S. and P. Satir, 1977, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 74:2045-2049) revealed that the doublet microtubule with the row of inner dynein arms, doublet N, always moved by sliding toward the proximal end of the axoneme relative to doublet N + 1. Therefore, the inner arms generate force such that doublet N pushes doublet N + 1 tipward. This is the same direction of microtubule sliding induced by ATP and trypsin in axonemes having both inner and outer dynein arms. The implications of this result for the mechanism of ciliary bending and utility in functional definition of cytoplasmic dyneins are discussed.
