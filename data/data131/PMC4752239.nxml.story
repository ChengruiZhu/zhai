DNA methylation is a chemical modification of DNA present in many prokaryotic genomes. The best-known role of DNA methylation is as a component of restriction-modification systems. In these systems, restriction enzymes target foreign DNA for cleavage, while DNA methylation protects the host genome from destruction. Studies in a handful of organisms show that DNA methylation may also act independently of restriction systems and function in genome regulation. However, a lack of technologies has limited the study of DNA methylation to a small number of organisms, and the broader patterns and functions of DNA methylation remain unknown. Here we use SMRT-sequencing to determine the genome wide DNA methylation patterns of more than 200 diverse bacteria and archaea. We show that DNA methylation is pervasive and present in more than 90% of studied organisms. Analysis of this data enabled annotation of the specific DNA binding sites of more than 600 restriction systems, revealing their extraordinary diversity. Strikingly, we observed widespread DNA methylation in the absence of restriction systems. Analyses of these patterns reveal that they are conserved through evolution, and likely function in genome regulation. Thus DNA methylation may play a far wider function in prokaryotic genome biology than was previously supposed.
