The engineering of T lymphocytes to express chimeric antigen receptors (CARs) aims to establish T cell-mediated tumor immunity rapidly. In this study, we conducted a pilot clinical trial of autologous or donor- derived T cells genetically modified to express a CAR targeting the B-cell antigen CD19 harboring 4-1BB and the CD3ζ moiety. All enrolled patients had relapsed or chemotherapy-refractory B-cell lineage acute lymphocytic leukemia (B-ALL). Of the nine patients, six had definite extramedullary involvement, and the rate of overall survival at 18 weeks was 56%. One of the two patients who received conditioning chemotherapy achieved a three-month durable complete response with partial regression of extramedullary lesions. Four of seven patients who did not receive conditioning chemotherapy achieved dramatic regression or a mixed response in the haematopoietic system and extramedullary tissues for two to nine months. Grade 2–3 graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) was observed in two patients who received substantial donor-derived anti-CD19 CART (chimeric antigen receptor-modified T) cells 3–4 weeks after cell infusions. These results show for the first time that donor-derived anti-CD19 CART cells can cause GVHD and regression of extramedullary B-ALL. This study is registered at
