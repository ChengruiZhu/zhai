Paranodin/contactin-associated protein (caspr) is a transmembrane glycoprotein of the neurexin superfamily that is highly enriched in the paranodal regions of myelinated axons. We have investigated the role of its association with F3/contactin, a glycosylphosphatidyl inositol (GPI)-anchored neuronal adhesion molecule of the Ig superfamily. Paranodin was not expressed at the cell surface when transfected alone in CHO or neuroblastoma cells. Cotransfection with F3 resulted in plasma membrane delivery of paranodin, as analyzed by confocal microscopy and cell surface biotinylation. The region that mediates association with paranodin was mapped to the Ig domains of F3 by coimmunoprecipitation experiments. The association of paranodin with F3 allowed its recruitment to Triton X-100â€“insoluble microdomains. The GPI anchor of F3 was necessary, but not sufficient for surface expression of paranodin. F3-Ig, a form of F3 deleted of the fibronectin type III (FNIII) repeats, although GPI-linked and expressed at the cell surface, was not recovered in the microdomain fraction and was unable to promote cell surface targeting of paranodin. Thus, a cooperative effect between the GPI anchor, the FNIII repeats, and the Ig regions of F3 is required for recruitment of paranodin into lipid rafts and its sorting to the plasma membrane.
