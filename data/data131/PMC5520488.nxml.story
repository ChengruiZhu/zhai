Cutaneous melanoma is a very deadly cancer because of its proclivity to metastasize. Despite the recent development of targeted and immune therapies, patient survival remains low. It is therefore crucial to enhance understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying invasion. We previously identified tetraspanin 8 (TSPAN8) as an important modulator of melanoma invasiveness, and several of its transcriptional regulators, which affect TSPAN8 expression during melanoma progression toward an invasive stage. This study found that TSPAN8 promoter contains consensus-binding sites for p53 transcription factor. We demonstrated that p53 silencing was sufficient to turn on Tspan8 expression in non-invasive melanoma cells and that p53 acts as a direct transcriptional repressor of TSPAN8. We also showed that p53 modulated matrigel invasion in melanoma cells in a TSPAN8-dependent manner. In conclusion, this study reveals p53 as a negative regulator of Tspan8 expression. As TP53 gene is rarely mutated in melanoma, it was hitherto poorly studied but its role in apoptosis and growth suppression in melanoma is increasingly becoming clear. The study highlights the importance of p53 as a regulator of melanoma invasion and the concept that reactivating p53 could provide a strategy for modulating not only proliferative but also invasive capacity in melanoma treatment.
