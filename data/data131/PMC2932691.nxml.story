In the course of cancer development, cells lose regulation of the cell cycle and quality control of DNA replication. As a result, many genomic alterations accumulate, among them amplifications and deletions of chromosomal regions of varying sizes. Oncogenes that drive transformation often reside in amplified regions, while tumor suppressors are deleted, yet for thousands of genes the effect of altering gene copy number is unknown. Since only genomic alterations that ultimately affect protein levels can have functional importance, a global proteomic approach that directly measures such changes is desirable. Here, we examined output of chromosomal alterations on the proteins in a system-wide manner. We analyzed the global protein expression of cancer cells compared to normal cells using mass-spectrometryâ€“based quantitative proteomics and quantified a large part of the expressed proteome. We compared the protein data to genomic data and matched changes in gene copy number to protein expression level changes for each gene. Overall, gene copy number changes explain only a few percent of observed protein expression changes. Knowledge of when genomic and proteomic changes correlate may help in a better understanding of regulatory mechanisms in tumor development.
