Metastasis-associated in colon cancer-1 (MACC1) has been reported to be overexpressed in diverse human malignancies, and the increasing amount of evidences suggest that its overexpression is associated with the development and progression of many human tumors. However, the prognostic and clinicopathological value of MACC1 in colorectal cancer remains inconclusive. Therefore, we conducted this meta-analysis to investigate the effect of MACC1 overexpression on clinicopathological features and survival outcomes in colorectal cancer. PubMed, CNKI, and Wanfang databases were searched for relevant articles published update to December 2015. Correlation of MACC1 expression level with overall survival (OS), disease-free survival (DFS), and clinicopathological features were analyzed. In this meta-analysis, fifteen studies with a total of 2,161 colorectal cancer patients were included. Our results showed that MACC1 overexpression was significantly associated with poorer OS and DFS. Moreover, MACC1 overexpression was significantly associated with gender, localization, TNM stage, T stage, and N stage. Together, our meta-analysis showed that MACC1 overexpression was significantly associated with poor survival rates, regional invasion and lymph-node metastasis. MACC1 expression level can serve as a novel prognostic factor in colorectal cancer patients.
