Patients with Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) have multiple symptoms. Nursing care is based on six core competencies and one of them is person-centred care that includes the aspect of professional symptom relief. The aim was to clarify a meaning of the concept of Symptom-reducing actions in the context of COPD. Databases MEDLINE and CINAHL were searched between 1982 and February 2016 and 26 publications were found. Two dictionaries and three books were investigated. The method of Walker & Avant was followed. The use of the concept of Symptom-reducing actions may be categorized by the sub-concepts of supervision, information, and patient education. Exploration of defining attributes was symptom management, instructions, support, motivation, explanation, advice, teaching, and learning. Antecedent occurrences were related to factors that affect the patientâ€™s level of function such as physical performance and cognitive function. Symptom-reducing actions offer a way to support patients with COPD in self-management. Symptom-reducing actions can mediate facts in a purposeful process performed by the nurse to enable the patient to take control over and manage unpleasant symptoms by a person-centred, planned process. The nurse can achieve this via supervision, information, and patient education with an integrated emotional component. Evaluating the outcomes is needed.
