Calcium currents (ICa) were measured in frog ventricular myocytes using the whole-cell patch clamp technique and a perfused pipette. To gain insight into the role of G proteins in the regulation of ICa in intact cells, the effect of internal perfusion with hydrolysis-resistant GTP analogues, guanylyl 5'-imidodiphosphate (GppNHp) or guanosine 5'- thiotriphosphate (GTP gamma S), on ICa stimulated by isoproterenol (Iso) or forskolin (Forsk) was examined. Significant differences were observed between the effects of the two GTP analogues. Internal perfusion of GppNHp resulted in a near-complete (approximately 80%) and irreversible inhibition of Iso-stimulated ICa. In contrast, internal perfusion with GTP gamma S resulted in only a partial (approximately 40%) inhibition of Iso- or Forsk-stimulated ICa. The fraction of the current not inhibited by GTP gamma S remained persistently elevated after the washout of Iso but declined to basal levels upon washout of Forsk. Excess internal GTP or GppNHp did not reduce the persistent ICa. Internal adenosine 5'-thiotriphosphate (ATP gamma S) mimicked the GTP gamma S-induced, persistent ICa. GppNHp sometimes induced a persistent ICa, but only if GppNHp was present at high concentration before Iso exposure. Inhibitors of protein kinase A inhibited both the GTP gamma S- and ATP gamma S-induced, persistent ICa. We conclude that: (a) GTP gamma S is less effective than GppNHp in inhibiting adenylyl cyclase (AC) via the inhibitory G protein, Gi; and (b) the persistent ICa results from a long-lived Gs-GTP gamma S complex that can activate AC in the absence of Iso. These results suggest that different hydrolysis- resistant nucleotide analogues may behave differently in activating G proteins and imply that the efficacy of G protein-effector molecule interactions can depend on the GTP analogue with which the G protein is activated.
