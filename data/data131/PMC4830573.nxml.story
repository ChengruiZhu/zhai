In budding yeast, DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) are mostly repaired by gene conversion (GC) in which an intact region with homology to both ends serves as template for repair. If only one of the DSB ends shares homology with another region, repair proceeds via break-induced replication (BIR), which, unlike GC, can lead to nonreciprocal translocations. We previously showed that a Recombination Execution Checkpoint (REC) delays BIR thereby preventing it from acting on breaks that can be repaired by GC. Here, we induced two DSBs such that only one end from each break shares homology with an ectopic donor so that although repair can proceed via GC, it will result in DNA rearrangement. We asked whether REC would inhibit GC-mediated repair in this scenario. We found that REC does not restrict such repair; however, repair by GC is faster when both ends are derived from a single DSB. We suggest that the DSB ends engage in a coordinated search for homology that favors both ends engaging the same donor, thus avoiding complex chromosomal rearrangements. Moreover, when the two ends of a DSB share homology with different loci, recombination of one end with its partner impedes repair of the other end.
