To successfully complete a task, we need to monitor our performance. If performance drops, we need to change our behaviour. We do this by adjusting cognitive control, an ensemble of processes through which behaviour is adapted to suit the task. In this study, we first used chronic recordings in the frontal lobe of macaque monkeys to characterise neurophysiological markers that reflect these processes: a brain potential reflecting performance monitoring and a sustained oscillatory signal reflecting cognitive control. It has been suggested that cognitive control, performance monitoring, and their neurophysiological markers are under the influence of dopamine. To understand how the input of dopamine is critical, we followed changes in the markers and performance during slow dopaminergic depletion. This protocol doubles up as a study of the early phase of Parkinson’s disease, when dopaminergic cells are dying but motor symptoms have yet to emerge. Whilst the performance monitoring potential attenuated at the end of the depletion, the performance itself did not. The oscillatory signals showed only subtle changes in comparison, despite the depletion. Together these results bring into question the simple idea that dopamine directly modulates frontal cortex, which in turn directly modulates cognition. We consider how the brain may compensate for a dopamine lesion, and whether the markers measure what we think they do. Our results question a current idea that neurophysiological markers can be directly used to predict dopamine loss in patients with conditions like Parkinson’s disease.
