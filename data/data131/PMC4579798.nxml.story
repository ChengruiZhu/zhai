Extraskeletal myxoid chondrosarcoma (ESMC) of the vulva is an extremely rare tumor and currently, there is little available information on its biological behavior and treatment strategy. The present study reports a case of recurrent ESMC of the vulva in a 32-year-old female. The patient presented with an increasingly painful mass of the right vulva, at the site of an exision which had been performed 7-months previously. The tumor mass was histopathologically diagnosed as primary ESMC of the vulva and subsequently, vulvectomy was performed. Cytological examination showed negative surgical margins. Intraoperative radiation therapy at a single dose of 10 Gy was administered to the bed of the removed tumor. The patient refused chemotherapy and five months after surgery, a new lesion was identified in the inguinal region. Bilateral inguinal-femoral lymph node dissection was performed and external beam radiation therapy at a dose of 40 Gy was administered to the inguinal region. Follow-up examination seven months after surgery revealed no evidence of disease progression and at present, the patient remains alive. This study highlights the importance of analyzing each clinical case of ESMC as this may lead to the development of guidelines for the optimal treatment of this rare tumor.
