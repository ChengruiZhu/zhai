Therapeutic drug monitoring is aimed at using drug concentration measurements to manage a patientâ€™s medication requirement and optimise clinical outcome, particularly in respect of drugs with narrow therapeutic index. Typically, immunoassay methods of various techniques are employed with the advantage of rapid turnaround time and ease of operation. The chromatographic methods are specific and cost effective, though more demanding and require technical expertise. The most crucial aspect of any therapeutic drug monitoring service is the expert clinical interpretation of drug concentration measurements taking into consideration individual pharmacokinetic variability in drug disposition across different populations. The setting up of a therapeutic drug monitoring service requires enormous resources, both in terms of equipment and trained personnel. This poses considerable constraints in developing countries due to limited scarce resources, coupled with ignorance among health practitioners on the relevance of therapeutic drug monitoring in clinical practice. Consequently, the need for advocacy, training and encouragement of health practitioners on the usefulness of therapeutic drug monitoring in enhancing patient care and overall clinical outcome in a developing country such as Nigeria can never be over-emphasised.
