 Ultrastructural studies were performed on normal and abnormal cilia and basal bodies associated with the choroidal epithelium of the chick embryo. Tissues were prepared in each of several fixatives including: 1% osmium tetroxide, in both phosphate and veronal acetate buffers; 2% glutaraldehyde, followed by postfixation in osmium tetroxide; 1% potassium permanganate in veronal acetate buffer. Normal cilia display the typical pattern of 9 peripheral doublets and 2 central fibers, as well as a system of 9 secondary fibers. The latter show distinct interconnections between peripheral and central fibers. Supernumerary fibers were found to occur in certain abnormal cilia. The basal body is complex, bearing 9 transitional fibers at the distal end and numerous cross-striated rootlets at the proximal end. The distal end of the basal body is delimited by a basal plate of moderate density. The tubular cylinder consists of 9 triple fibers. The C subfibers end at the basal plate, whereas subfibers A and B continue into the shaft of the cilium. The 9 transitional fibers radiate out from the distal end of the basal body, ending in bulblike terminal enlargements which are closely associated with the cell membrane in the area of the basal cup. One or 2 prominent basal feet project laterally from the basal body. These structures characteristically show several dense cross-bands and, on occasion, are found associated with microtubules.
