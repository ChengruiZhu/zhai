Apical ballooning syndrome (ABS), also known as Takotsubo cardiomyopathy, was first reported by Dote and colleagues in Japanese literature in 1991 in a review of five cases. Case series have highlighted the association of severe psychological stressors as the major precipitating factors of this syndrome. Status Epilepticus and Sub-Arachnoid hemorrhage are also now established independent etiologies for this phenomenon in patients without coronary artery disease. We report a case of reversible apical ventricular dysfunction in a 50-year-old male presenting with status asthmaticus who quickly underwent intubation. Following this, he had ST elevations in precordial leads with mild cardiac enzyme leak. Subsequent cardiac catheterization revealed a left ventricular ejection fraction of 25â€“30% with apical aneurismal segment. No obstructive disease was observed. Three days later there was marked clinical improvement; the patient was extubated and repeat echocardiography revealed a remarkable return to normal ventricular size and systolic function. Our case demonstrates that excess use of beta-agonists may be a potential risk factor for ABS and raises the possibility of cathecholamine cardiotoxicity being mediated via beta-receptors. Furthermore, it also negates the propensity of apical ballooning so far reported only in women with respiratory distress without confounding emotional stressors.
