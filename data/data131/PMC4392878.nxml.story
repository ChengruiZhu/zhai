Isomorellin or forbesione alone inhibited the growth of these CCA cell lines in a dose-dependent manner and showed selective cytotoxicity against CCA cells but not against Chang cells. Isomorellin/doxorubicin combination showed a synergistic growth inhibitory effect on KKU-M139 and KKU-M156 cells, while the forbesione/doxorubicin combination showed a synergistic growth inhibitory effect on KKU-100 and KKU-M139 cells. The percentages of apoptotic cells were significantly higher in the combined treatments than in the respective single drug treatments. The combined treatments strongly enhanced the expression of Bax/Bcl-2, activated caspase-9 and caspase-3, while suppressing the expression of survivin, procaspase-9 and procaspase-3, compared with single drug treatments. The degree of suppression of NF-κB activation mediated by a decrease in the expression of NF-κB/p65, a reduction of the pIκB-α level and an increase in the IκB-α protein level, was significantly higher in the combined treatment groups than in the single drug treatment groups. The degree of suppression of MRP1 protein expression was also significantly higher in the combined treatment than in the single drug treatment groups.
