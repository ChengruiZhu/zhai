Prostate cancer is a threat to men and usually occurs in aged males. Though prostate specific antigen level and Gleason score are utilized for evaluation of the prostate cancer in clinic, the biomarkers for this malignancy have not been widely recognized. Furthermore, the outcome varies across individuals receiving comparable treatment regimens and the underlying mechanism is still unclear. We supposed that genetic feature may be responsible for, at least in part, this process and conducted a two-cohort study to compare the genetic difference in tumorous and normal tissues of prostate cancer patients. The Gene Expression Omnibus dataset were used and a total of 41 genes were found significantly differently expressed in tumor tissues as compared with normal prostate tissues. Four genes (SPOCK3, SPON1, PTN and TGFB3) were selected for further evaluation after Gene Ontology analysis, Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathway analysis and clinical association analysis. MIR1908 was also found decreased expression level in prostate cancer whose target genes were found expressing in both prostate tumor and normal tissues. These results indicated that these potential biomarkers deserve attention in prostate cancer patients and the underlying mechanism should be further investigated.
