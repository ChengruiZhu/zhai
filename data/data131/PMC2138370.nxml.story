/ml by 4–6 hr. Exposure to actinomycin prior to or shortly after viral induction effectively blocks interferon synthesis by cells of both types. However, macrophages become refractory to actinomycin by 30–60 min compared with 607–120 min for RK cells, a finding which suggests earlier and more rapid transcription of interferon-specific messenger RNA in macrophages. Macrophages harvested from the peritioneal cavity of rabbits injected intravenously with NDV 48 hr previously also exhibit slightly reduced capacity to synthesize interferon, but this tolerant state is less marked than is tolerance to production of circulating interferon in intact rabbits. Interferon is also synthesized by rabbit macrophages not infected with virus but simply incubated at 37°C in medium with or without added bacterial endotoxin. Uninfected polymorphonuclear leukocytes, rabbit kidney and spleen cells produced no detectable interferon under similar conditions of cultivation. No interferon was released by intact macrophages incubated at 4°C or by ultrasonically disrupted macrophages incubated at 37°C. Although interferon titers were found to be higher when uninfected cultures were exposed to 10–100 µg/ml of
