Chromosome region 15q11q13, known for its instability, is highly susceptible to clinically relevant genomic rearrangements, such as supernumerary marker chromosomes formed by the inverted duplication of proximal chromosome 15. Inv dup(15) results in tetrasomy 15p and partial tetrasomy 15q. The large rearrangements, containing the Prader-Willi/Angelman syndrome critical region (PWS/ASCR), are responsible for the inv dup(15) or idic(15) syndrome. Diagnosis is achieved by standard cytogenetics and FISH analysis, using probes both from proximal chromosome 15 and from the PWS/ASCR. Microsatellite analysis on parental DNA or methylation analysis on the proband DNA, are also needed to detect the parent-of-origin of the inv dup(15) chromosome. Array CGH has been shown to provide a powerful approach for identifying and detecting the extent of the duplication. The possible occurrence of double supernumerary isodicentric chromosomes derived from chromosome 15, resulting in partial hexasomy of the maternally inherited PWS/ASCR, should be considered in the differential diagnosis. Large idic(15) are nearly always sporadic. Antenatal diagnosis is possible. Management of inv dup(15) includes a comprehensive neurophysiologic and developmental evaluation. Survival is not significantly reduced.
