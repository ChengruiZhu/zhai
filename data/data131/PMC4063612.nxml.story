The gastrointestinal tract is the most common location for primary extranodal non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) with cases less commonly found in the intestine. The majority of primary intestinal B-cell lymphomas are exophytic, whereas enteropathy-associated T-cell lymphomas present predominantly as thickened plaques, ulcers or strictures. Crohnâ€™s disease (CD) is a chronic inflammatory disease of the intestines with fissures and ulcers, which is difficult for clinicians to diagnose based on endoscopic observations alone. Malignant lymphoma must be considered when clinically diagnosed CD is refractory to medication or when its clinical course becomes aggressive. The current study presents a rare case of primary colon T-cell lymphoma in a 16-year-old male with poor prognosis, as well as a case of gastrointestinal lymphoma occurring in the duodenum and colon in a 62-year-old male with a 10-year history of NHL. It was difficult to determine the diagnosis by a single endoscopic biopsy as the majority of biopsy specimens revealed mixed inflammation within which the lymphoma cells were difficult to identify. The present study indicated that it is important to recognize ulcerative or stenotic lymphoma and to differentiate it from CD as it exhibits a much more aggressive clinical behavior. The correct diagnosis may be confirmed by careful histopathological study and ancillary examination.
