Proteomic analysis identified differentially expressed proteins between zoledronic acid-resistant and aggressive DU145R80 prostate cancer (PCa) cells and their parental DU145 cells. Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) showed a strong relationship between the identified proteins within a network associated with cancer and with homogeneous cellular functions prevalently related with regulation of cell organization, movement and consistent with the smaller and reduced cell-cell contact morphology of DU145R80 cells. The identified proteins correlated in publically available human PCa genomic data with increased tumor expression and aggressiveness. DU145R80 exhibit also a clear increase of alpha-v-(αv) integrin, and of urokinase receptor (uPAR), both included within the same network of the identified proteins. Interestingly, the actin-rich structures localized at the cell periphery of DU145R80 cells are rich of Filamin A, one of the identified proteins and uPAR which, in turn, co-localizes with αv-integrin, in podosomes and/or invadopodia. Notably, the invasive feature of DU145R80 may be prevented by blocking anti-αv antibody. Overall, we unveil a signaling network that physically links the interior of the nucleus via the cytoskeleton to the extracellular matrix and that could dictate PCa aggressiveness suggesting novel potential prognostic markers and therapeutic targets for PCa patients.
