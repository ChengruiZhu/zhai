-methyldiethanolamine, they were synthesized aqueous dispersions of polyurethane cationomers, from which films were prepared after adding 0–2 wt% graphene. In order to obtain nanocomposites, graphene was previously noncovalent functionalized in tetrahydrofurane in the field of ultrasound. The chemical structure and the morphology of obtained nanocomposites were analyzed by IR spectroscopy, atomic force microscopy (AFM), and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) microcalorimetry methods. It was found that the presence of graphene results in increased thermal and mechanical strength of received polymer films and contributes to the increase in hydrophobicity of generally hydrophilic coatings prepared from waterborne polyurethane cationomers. Based on received results, possible interactions between graphene and phase structure of polyurethane cationomers were discussed. Relating to the so far described applications of graphene for the modification of polyurethanes, the novelty of this work is the concept of incorporation of graphene particles to polyurethane cationomer chains exclusively through a simple noncovalent functionalization and to investigate the effect of graphene on the properties obtained in this way of thin polyurethane film.
