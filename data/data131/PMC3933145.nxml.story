The process of building new blood vessels (angiogenesis) and controlling the propagation of blood vessels (anti-angiogenesis) are fundamental to human health, as they play key roles in wound healing and tissue growth. More than 500 million people may stand to benefit from anti- or pro-angiogenic treatments in the coming decades [National Cancer Institute (USA), Cancer Bulltetin, volume 3, no. 9, 2006]. The use of animal models to assay angiogenesis is crucial to the search for therapeutic agents that inhibit angiogenesis in the clinical setting. Examples of persons that would benefit from these therapies are cancer patients, as cancer growth and spread is angiogenesis-dependent, and patients with aberrant angiogenesis in the eye, which may lead to blindness or defective sight. Recently, anti-angiogenesis therapies have been introduced successfully in the clinic, representing a turning point in tumor therapy and the treatment of macular degeneration and heralding a new era for the treatment of several commonly occurring angiogenesis-related diseases. On the other hand, pro-angiogenic therapies that promote compensatory angiogenesis in hypoxic tissues, such as those subjected to ischemia in myocardial or cerebral hypoxia due to occluding lesions in the coronary or cerebral arteries, respectively, and in cases of poor wound healing, are also being developed. In this review, the current major and newly introduced preclinical angiogenesis assays are described and discussed in terms of their specific advantages and disadvantages from the biological, technical, economical and ethical perspectives. These assays include the corneal micropocket, chick chorioallantoic membrane, rodent mesentery, subcutaneous (s.c.) sponge/matrix/alginate microbead, s.c. Matrigel plug, s.c. disc, and s.c. directed
