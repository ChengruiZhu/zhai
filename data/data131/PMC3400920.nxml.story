The 7 and 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccines are mostly used in routine infant immunizations to prevent the development of pneumococcal disease. Currently, the dosing schedule approved and recommended for PCV7 and PCV13 in infants is 3 primary doses followed by a booster dose in the second year of life. However, a number of countries use a 2-dose only primary series with a booster dose in the second year of life. This review is aimed at providing the reader with a broad perspective on the currently available evidence which supports the clinical use of such reduced dosing schedules for the PCV7 and PCV13 vaccines. Recent evidence has been able to promulgate the immunogenicity and in some cases the effectiveness of the reduced dosing schedule for these vaccines. These findings may reduce costs as well as minimize supply and administration problems relating to the provision of the pneumococcal conjugated vaccines (PCVs). However, some caution is warranted since some inferior data have emerged with regards to the antibody immune response to certain pneumococcal serotypes following the implementation of such reduced dosing regimens. In addition, it is proposed that prospective surveillance be undertaken in all countries which have adopted the reduced-dosage immunization programs. This review may go some way in educating healthcare practitioners and healthcare policy decision makers at large.
