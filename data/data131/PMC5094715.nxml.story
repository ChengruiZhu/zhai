Polyploidy is frequently observed in eukaryotes, including in human liver cells and cancer. Evolutionary studies also suggest that polyploidy has contributed to species diversification and novel adaptation in fungi, plants and animals. However, artificially-constructed polyploids often display chromosome instability and quickly convert to aneuploids. This phenomenon conflicts with observations that many species derived from ancient genome duplications have maintained the extra number of chromosomes following polyploidization. What happened during the early stages of these polyploidy events that stabilized the duplicated genomes? We used laboratory evolution experiments to investigate this process. After being propagated in a rich medium at 23°C for 1000 generations, newly-constructed tetraploid yeast cells had evolved stable genomes. In addition, evolved cells acquired resistance to stresses specific to tetraploids and exhibited a more diploid-like transcriptome profile. Further analyses indicated that Sch9—the functional ortholog of mammalian S6 kinase involved in protein homeostasis, G1 progression, stress response and nutrient signaling—contributed to the evolved phenotypes. Evolved cells increased the protein abundance and stability of Sch9. Reconstitution experiments showed that overexpression of
