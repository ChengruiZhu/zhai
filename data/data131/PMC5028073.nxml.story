During the repeated execution of precision movement tasks, humans face two formidable challenges from the motor system itself: dimensionality and noise. Human motor performance involves biomechanical, neuromotor, and perceptual degrees of freedom far in excess of those theoretically needed to prescribe typical goal-directed tasks. At the same time, noise is present in the human body across multiple scales of observation. This high-dimensional and stochastic character of biological movement is the fundamental source of variability ubiquitously observed during task execution. However, it is becoming clear that these two challenges are not merely impediments to be overcome, but rather hold a key to understanding how humans maintain motor performance under changing circumstances, such as those caused by fatigue, injury, or aging. In this work, by studying skilled human participants as they play a virtual shuffleboard game, we demonstrate the fundamental importance of adopting a dynamical perspective when analyzing the motor variability observed over many trials. Using this dynamical approach, we can not only study the geometry of observed inter-trial variability, but can also theoretically describe and experimentally characterize how it is temporally generated and regulated. Furthermore, our theoretical framework and model-based data analysis approach helps to unify previous variability analysis approaches based on stability, correlation, control theory, or task manifolds alone. This conceptual unification supports the idea that such seemingly disparate features of motor variability arise from a single, relatively simple underlying neurophysiological process of motor regulation.
