 1. Murine SK poliomyelitis virus has been transferred from mouse to guinea pig with the establishment of a fixed strain of cavian passage virus. 2. The disease thus produced in guinea pigs is characterized by the occurrence of flaccid paralysis. Typical poliomyelitic lesions are found in the anterior horn of the spinal cord. 3. Guinea pigs are susceptible to infection with murine virus by the intracerebral, intravenous, intraperitoneal, and subcutaneous route; cavian passage virus produces paralysis only upon intracerebral or intravenous injection. Neither virus paralyzes guinea pigs by feeding or nasal instillation. 4. The potency of the virus (murine or cavian) in guinea pigs is considerably lower than in mice and compares with the titer of the original SK strain in monkeys. In paralyzed guinea pigs the virus is found only in the central nervous system and not in extraneural sites, such as blood or abdominal viscera. 5. Attempts to cultivate cavian passage virus in tissue culture have yielded evidence of some  monkeys. Of a total of 35 monkeys injected intracerebrally with guinea pig passage virus 26 failed to respond with any manifest symptoms of disease; 8 monkeys showed various signs of definite involvement of the central nervous system consisting of tremor, convulsions, facial palsy, and localized pareses; 1 monkey developed typical flaccid paralysis. 9. Following injection with cavian virus the virus may be recovered from the tissues of normal monkeys but not from the tissues of convalescent monkeys shortly after a paralyzing attack of poliomyelitis due to SK or Aycock virus. 10. Immunization of monkeys with early cavian passage virus by the subcutaneous route has given no clear-cut evidence of protection against intracerebral reinfection with SK poliomyelitis virus. Neither has there been any evidence of effective interference in monkeys injected intravenously with early cavian passage virus and intracerebrally with RMV poliomyelitis virus. 11. The bearing of the experimental data upon the epidemiology of the human disease is discussed.
