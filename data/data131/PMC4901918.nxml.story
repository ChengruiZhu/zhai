Baseball pitchers (n=143 age=15.7±1.2; height=165.0±43.8cm; weight=72.2±12.6kg) participating in all team activities were block randomized by school to intervention (INV n=88) or control (CON n=76) groups. The INV group received an Athletic Trainer supervised posterior shoulder flexibility and strengthening program (3x/week for 8-weeks). The CON group participated in their usual training. All pitchers participated in a 4-week interval-throwing program immediate to the start of practice. Bilateral shoulder ROM and strength were assessed pre-post program using a digital inclinometer (DI) to measure supine external rotation(ER), internal rotation (IR), and horizontal adduction (HA) ROM with the scapula stabilized at 90 degrees of abduction. Standard manual muscle testing was used for strength assessments using a hand held dynamometer with arm at the side(ER-0) and in supine 90 degrees/90 degrees (ER-90, IR-90) then normalized to body weight (BW). Injuries were recorded over the subsequent baseball season. Two trials were averaged and used to calculate deficits (non-dominant-dominant) and pre-post change scores to examine the ability of the program to ameliorate baseline deficits associated with injury risk. A one-way ANOVA was used to compare change scores between groups and a 2-way ANOVA (group by injury) to examine the change scores influence on injury (α=0.05).
