Triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) is an aggressive type of breast cancer with high heterogeneity. To date, there is no efficient therapy for TNBC patients and the prognosis is poor. It is urgent to find new biomarkers for the diagnosis of TNBC or efficient therapy targets. As an area of focus in the post-genome period, long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) have been found to play critical roles in many cancers, including TNBC. However, there is little information on differentially expressed lncRNAs between TNBC and non-TNBC. We detected the expression levels of lncRNAs in TNBC and non-TNBC tissues separately. Then we analyzed the lncRNA expression signature of TNBC relative to non-TNBC, and found dysregulated lncRNAs participated in important biological processes though Gene Ontology and Pathway analysis. Finally, we validated these lncRNA expression levels in breast cancer tissues and cells, and then confirmed that 4 lncRNAs (RP11-434D9.1, LINC00052, BC016831, and IGKV) were correlated with TNBC occurrence through receiver operating characteristic curve analysis. This study offers helpful information to understand the initiation and development mechanisms of TNBC comprehensively and suggests potential biomarkers for diagnosis or therapy targets for clinical treatment.
