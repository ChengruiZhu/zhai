The aim of the present study was to perform a retrospective analysis to investigate the outcome and toxicity of radiation (RT) and chemoradiation (CRT) in elderly, inoperable patients >70 years old. Between 2003 and 2012, 1,024 patients with squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) of the esophagus were treated at the Department of Thoracic Cancer, West China Hospital (Chengdu, China). Of these patients, 37 were >70 years old and had not undergone surgery, and were selected for analysis. Of these 37 patients, CRT had been administered to 20 (54%). Actuarial survival rates were determined by the Kaplan-Meier method. The one-year survival rate in the CRT group (n=20) was 85%, while 35% of patients in the RT group (n=17) survived for more than one year. The overall and progression-free survival in the CRT group versus the RT group were 17 months [95% confidence interval (CI), 11.861–22.139] versus eight months (95% CI, 6.674–9.326) (P=0.013) and 14 months (95% CI, 9.617–18.383) versus five months (95% CI, 2.311–7.689) (P=0.01), respectively. Patients irradiated with a dose of >50 Gy exhibited an improved survival rate compared with patients who received a dose of ≤50 Gy (18 vs. 14 months; P=0.049). Furthermore, patients with an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) score of ≤1 had an improved prognosis compared with those with an ECOG score of 2 (14 vs. seven months; P=0.006). The two regimens were well-tolerated and there were no therapy-associated mortalities. The current retrospective study indicated that patients of >70 years old with inoperable esophageal SCC and a good ECOG score exhibit comparably better safety levels with CRT and improved survival rates compared with RT alone.
