The main pathological characteristic of glomerulonephritis is diffuse mesangial cell proliferation. MiR-34a is associated with the proliferation of various organs and cancer cells. However, the role of miR-34a in renal proliferation diseases is not clear. Therefore, this study aimed to elucidate the mechanism of miR-34a in the regulation of renal mesangial cell proliferation. The miR-34a expression level at different time points in an anti-Thy1 mesangial proliferative nephritis rat model was determined by qRT-PCR. The cell proliferation rate and cell cycle changes were measured in the in vitro cultured rat mesangial cells (RMCs). Our results suggested that miR-34a expression was negatively correlated with the degree of cell proliferation in the anti-Thy1 nephritis model. MiR-34a could extend the G0/G1 phase and block cell proliferation in RMCs. Dual-luciferase assay results showed that there were binding sites of miR-34a at 3′-UTR of platelet-derived growth factor receptor-β (PDGFR-β). MiR-34a can inhibit PDGFR-β protein expression at a post-transcriptional level, suppress Ras/MAPK signaling pathways, and down-regulate expression of cell cycle proteins at the G0/G1 phase, such as cyclin D1, CDK4/CDK6. In addition, miR-34a may also inhibit RMC proliferation by directly targeting cyclin E and CDK2. MiR-34a inhibits exogenous stimuli-induced proliferation of mesangial cells. Expression levels of phospho-PDGFR-β and phospho-MEK1 (an important downstream molecule in PDGFR-β-induced signaling pathway) were significantly increased in the anti-Thy-1 nephritis rat model. These results suggest that miR-34a may regulate RMC proliferation by directly inhibiting expressions of PDGFR-β, MEK1, and cell cycle proteins, cyclin E and CDK2.
