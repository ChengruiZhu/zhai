Expression of the β-globin gene is regulated by interactions between a distant Locus Control Region (LCR) and regulatory elements in or near the gene. We previously showed that LCR activity requires specific β-globin intron elements to consistently activate transgene expression in mice. These important intronic elements fail to transmit through lentivirus vectors designed for gene therapy of Sickle Cell Anemia. In this study, we identify intron modifications that reveal functional cooperation between the β-globin intronic enhancer and an intronic Oct-1 site. LCR activity in transgenic mice is also potentiated by an intronically located Igμ 3′MAR element. During induction of erythroid gene expression, the modified intron directs relocalization of the transgene away from the nuclear periphery towards more central neighbourhoods, and this movement mimics relocalization by the endogenous β-globin locus. Lentivirus vectors with the modified intron produce high titer virus stocks that express the transgene to therapeutic levels in erythroid cells. These findings have implications for understanding the mechanism of LCR activity, and for designing safe and effective lentivirus vectors for gene therapy.
