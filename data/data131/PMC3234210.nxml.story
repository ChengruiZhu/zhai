Far from being silent and static, the habitat of a cell is usually composed by multiple and simultaneous signals. We can consider nutrients, hormones, temperature, light, and other stimuli as elements building a default environment in which cells grow, divide and die. This environment, which has an intrinsically fluctuating nature, is the setting in which cells process all incoming stimuli. Here we examine the role that this background activity –or signaling chatter– plays in the transmission of information in a typical human cell. We address this question using a cellular model of signal transduction that we simulate using both random and periodic stimuli. We find that the level of background chatter determines the response of the whole signaling network to external stimuli. Different areas of the network are activated by specific levels of background activity, routing the information through chatter-dependent paths. In this way, different levels of chatter allow the network to select between different responses, given the same stimulus. These features depend on the architecture and functional connectivity of a truly biological network, since we find that randomized versions of the model are incapable of showing this behavior.
