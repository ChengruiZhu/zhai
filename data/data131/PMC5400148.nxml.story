The groups were demographically comparable at baseline. The Constant score had improved significantly at follow-up in both the OSG and the ASG (p=0.003 and 0.011 respectively). No improvement was detected in the PTG. The OSG revealed a significant improvement compared to the PTG at follow-up (p=0.011), otherwise no significant differences were found. For the Watson & Sonnabend score the OSG revealed significant improvement in 13/14 questions. The corresponding was found in the ASG and the PTG in 9/14 questions (p=0.14). Using ultra-sound 1/20 patients in the OSG revealed a full-thickness rotator cuff rupture on the index side. The corresponding was found for 1/18 in the ASG and 4/28 in the PTG (p=0.29). On the contralateral side 2/20 patients in the OSG revealed a full-thickness rotator cuff tear. The corresponding was found for 1/18 in the ASG and 4/28 in the PTG (p=0.36). On the x-rays 3/20 patients in the OSG revealed moderate or severe osteoarthritis in the index shoulder. The corresponding was found for 1/18 in the ASG and 0/28 in the PTG (p=0.12). 1/20 patients in the OSG revealed osteoarthritis in the contra-lateral shoulder. The corresponding was found for 1/18 in the ASG and 0/28 in the PTG (p=0.11).
