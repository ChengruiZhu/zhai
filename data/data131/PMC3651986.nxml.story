Managing persistent and symptomatic urachal anomalies requires wide surgical excision of all anomalous tissue with a cuff of bladder tissue via the open approach. We report 7 cases with complete laparoscopic removal of symptomatic urachal remnants with or without a cuff of bladder tissue. We expected that this technique would be less invasive and have lower morbidity. We report on the feasibility of this approach, including efficacy and outcomes. Eight patients with a mean age of 36.5 years who had symptomatic urachal diseases underwent laparoscopic excision between July 2004 and July 2012. With the use of four ports, the urachal remnant was dissected transperitoneally and then removed via the umbilicus port. The clinical results of laparoscopic urachal remnant excision as a minimally invasive surgery, the perioperative records, and pathologic results were evaluated. There were no intraoperative or postoperative complications. Mean surgery time was 2.7 hours. Mean hospital stay was 14.6 days. The patients with bladder cuff resection had a long admission and Foley catheterization period (mean, 14.4 and 11 days). Pathological evaluations were 6 cases of infected urachal cysts, 1 case of infected urachal sinus, and 1 case of urachal adenocarcinoma. We found no postoperative complications including any symptom recurrence or voiding difficulty during a mean follow-up of 46.3 months. The perioperative surgical outcomes achieved infection control and symptomatic relief and additionally good cosmesis. Complete laparoscopic removal of symptomatic urachal remnants with or without a cuff of bladder tissue seems to be a safe, effective, and better cosmetic alternative with the advantages of a minimally invasive approach.
