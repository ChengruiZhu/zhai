In addition to their number and structure, the position and spatial dynamics of chromosomes are under tight control, as direct interactions between chromosomes can contribute to the activation or repression of genes. Here, we focus on a particular type of interaction, known as somatic homolog pairing, which occurs between the maternal and paternal copies of chromosomes. While the role of somatic pairing on downstream homology-driven processes is well-established, there is much to be learned about how homologous chromosome segments find each other, physically align, and form stable pairing interactions within somatic cells. Taking advantage of a novel high-throughput FISH technology and the fact that homologous chromosomes are intimately paired along their lengths in the somatic cells of Drosophila, we have conducted a screen for factors that are important for the fidelity of somatic pairing. Ultimately, the characterization of these pairing genes will shed light on the mechanism of pairing, as well as pairing-mediated processes that have implications for development and disease. Finally, the efficacy of our screen for pairing genes suggests that the high-throughput FISH technology described here will prove useful for studying forms of nuclear organization and chromosome positioning beyond pairing.
