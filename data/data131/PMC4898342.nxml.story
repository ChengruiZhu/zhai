Two male and three female patients were studied. All of the patients presented with a reduced serum phosphate level (0.38–0.60 mmol/L) accompanied with hyperphosphaturia at 10.9–23.8 mmol/24 h. The serum potassium level was also reduced or at lower range (2.56–3.54 mmol/L), but the 24-h urinary potassium was relatively increased. Urinalysis also demonstrated increased excretion of glucose in four patients. Urine protein electrophoresis showed low-to-moderate molecular weight protein. Three patients manifested urine acidification function impairment. Four patients had accompanying renal insufficiency. Three patients had difficulty walking and presented with a reduction in height (2.5–14 cm). Renal biopsy revealed that most of the glomeruli were normal accompanied by mild interstitial fibrosis with inflammatory cell infiltration. ADV treatment was subsequently ceased. Patients were treated with regular phosphate supplementation, citrate acid potassium and calcium bicarbonate. After 6-month treatment, the bone pain was significantly alleviated. Serum creatinine of one patient returned to normal levels and two patients who had difficulty walking were able to walk independently.
