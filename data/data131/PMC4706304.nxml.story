Proteins are fascinating molecular machines capable of organizing themselves into well-defined hierarchical structures through a huge number of conformational changes to accomplish a wide range of cellular functions. Protein conformational changes may be characterized by transitions from a low-energy conformation to another. Computer simulations and in particular molecular modelling may be able to predict protein transition dynamics and kinetics, thus playing a key role in describing protein tendencies towards specific conformational rearrangements. Approaching this problem from an energetic point of view is of great importance especially in case of amyloidogenic proteins, given the intimate interconnection between the functional energy landscape and aggregation risk. In this work we have employed molecular modelling techniques to shed light into conformational dynamics and kinetics of the Josephin Domain, part of the protein Ataxin 3, which is responsible for the spinocerebbellar ataxia 3, also called Machado Joseph Disease. In greater detail, we have employed enhanced sampling approaches to provide an estimation of the free energy landscape characterizing the transition pathway among several known molecular arrangements of the Josephin Domain.
