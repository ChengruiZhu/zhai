Steroid hormones are cholesterol derivates that control many aspects of animal physiology, including development of the adult organisms, growth, energy storage, and reproduction. In insects, pulses of the steroid hormone ecdysone precede molting and metamorphosis, the regulation of hormonal synthesis being a crucial step that determines animal viability and size. Reduced levels of the small ubiquitin-like modifier SUMO in the prothoracic gland block the synthesis of ecdysone, as SUMO is needed for cholesterol intake. Here we show that SUMO is required for the expression of Scavenger Receptors (Class B, type I). These membrane receptors are necessary for lipid uptake by the gland. Strikingly, their expression is sufficient to recover lipid content when SUMO is removed. The expression of the Scavenger Receptors depends on Ftz-f1, a nuclear transcription factor homologous to mammalian Steroidogenic factor 1 (SF-1). Interestingly, the expression of Ftz-f1 also depends on SUMO and, in addition, Ftz-f1 is SUMOylated. This modification modulates its capacity to activate the Scavenger Receptor Snmp1. The role of SUMO, Scavenger Receptors, and Ftz-f1 on lipid intake is conserved in other tissues that synthesize steroid hormones, such as the ovaries. These factors are conserved in vertebrates, with mutations underlying human disease, so this mechanism to regulate lipid uptake could have implications for human health.
