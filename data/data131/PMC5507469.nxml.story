The HLA complex is a region of the human genome containing immune system genes. Our study concerns those HLA genes that orchestrate defense against viral infections. Distinguishing HLA genes from other human genes is their extensive variation within individuals, families and populations. One advantage of this genetic variation is to increase the depth and breadth of the weaponry used against viruses; another is to impede the spread of infection within families and communities. A drawback to HLA variation is that bone-marrow transplants between donors and patients of different HLA type trigger immune reactions that attack and can kill the patient. For some patients an HLA identical family member can be the donor, but for others an unrelated HLA identical donor is sought. Facilitating these searches are registries, listing millions of possible donors whose HLA types were determined by gene sequencing. During the last ten years, this effort produced exponential growth in the number of HLA variants sequenced. This gave us the unprecedented opportunity to compare more than 10,000 sequences and distinguish aspects of the variation that are important for immune functions, from those that are not. First, however, we needed to develop software that could handle this mass of data.
