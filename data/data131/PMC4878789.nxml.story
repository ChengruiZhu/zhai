These findings show that the risk of several (but not all) common bacterial, viral, and fungal infections was higher among people prescribed glucocorticoids for a range of underlying diseases than among people matched for age, gender, and underlying disease who were not prescribed glucocorticoids. Notably, the relative risk of LRTI and local candidiasis was particularly high during the first weeks of glucocorticoid exposure. Several aspects of the study design may affect the accuracy of these findings. For example, the use of medical records may have resulted in some misclassification of infectious outcomes. However, the finding of a high risk of LRTI in patients prescribed systemic glucocorticoids should be considered before prescribing these drugs, particularly in patients with asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. The finding of an association between low blood albumin level and increased infection risk needs further investigation to determine whether a low albumin level is a direct risk factor for infection or a marker for other underlying causes of debilitation that increase the risk of infection, but it may be worth considering monitoring albumin level before and during glucocorticoid treatment.
