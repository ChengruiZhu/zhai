 This is an investigation of the effects on the late after-potential of immersing frog sartorius muscles in three kinds of modified Ringer's fluid; hypertonic, low chloride, and potassium-free. The late after-potential has been attributed to the depolarizing effect of an accumulation of potassium, during a preceding train of impulses, in the intermediary space of the model of a muscle fiber proposed by Adrian and Freygang. Both the hypertonic and low chloride solutions prolonged the late after-potential reversibly and the potassium-free solution shortened it. The effect of the low potassium solution fitted those data calculated from the model, but the effect of the hypertonic and low chloride solutions required an increase in size of the intermediary space of the model in order to fit the calculated data. An electron microscopic study of the muscles showed that the size of the transverse tubular system changed reversibly in the hypertonic and low chloride solutions in almost the amount necessary to fit the experimental data to the calculated data. This agreement between the change in size of the transverse tubular system and that of the intermediary space indicates that the intermediary space may be the transverse tubular system.
