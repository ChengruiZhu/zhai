This paper reports a detailed ultrastructural and immunocytochemical investigation of the structure of the milk fat globule membrane (MFGM) in a variety of species. The process follows the same pattern in all mammals so far investigated. The initial (or primary) MFGM immediately on release from the mammary cell is a continuous unit membrane with a thin underlying layer of cytoplasmic origin and a monolayer of phospholipid separating it from the core lipid. This structure changes rapidly as the milk fat globule (MFG) moves into the alveolar lumen. The unit membrane plus the underlying layer of cytoplasm modifies drastically into discontinuous patches and networks. These are superimposed upon a continuous apparently structureless sheet of electron dense material stabilising the MFG and similar to that which bounded the lipid in the cell. The underlying layer of the patches increases in electron density and immunocytochemistry demonstrates localisation of MFGM proteins in this layer. In four species, the dense material shows ordered paracrystalline molecular arrays in section and en face views. All the arrays show the same basic pattern and unit size as determined by optical diffraction. Similar patches, networks and arrays are present on the surface of expressed MFG. Negative staining of lipid-extracted expressed MFGs shows similar patches and networks of membrane. These also occasionally show the crystalline arrays and label with MFGM protein antibodies. Similar networks and strands of plasma membrane on the MFG surface are shown by our CLSM examination of unfixed expressed MFG from mice genetically modified to express a fluorescent molecule as a normal plasma membrane constituent.
