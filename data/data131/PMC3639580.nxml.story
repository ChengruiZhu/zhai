1.2 pore-only simulations, after the simulated voltages from the previous study were recalculated using the correct method, new insight into which is provided here. Including the voltage-sensing domains in the simulated channel brought the linear currentâ€“voltage regime closer to the experimentally accessible voltages. The simulated permeation rate, however, still underestimated the experimental rate, because formation of the knock-on intermediate occurred too infrequently. Reducing the interaction strength between the ion and the selectivity filter did not increase conductance. In complementary simulations of gramicidin A, similar changes in interaction strength did increase the observed permeation rate. Permeation nevertheless remained substantially below the experimental value, largely because of infrequent ion recruitment into the pore lumen. Despite the need to apply large voltages to simulate the permeation process, the apparent voltage insensitivity of the permeation mechanism suggests that the direct simulation of permeation at the single-ion level can provide fundamental physiological insight into ion channel function. Notably, our simulations suggest that the knock-on permeation mechanisms in K
