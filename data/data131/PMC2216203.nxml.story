Intracellular pH (pHi) of the squid axon is regulated by a stilbenesensitive transporter that couples the influx of Na+ and HCO3- (or the equivalent) to the efflux of Cl-. According to one model, the extracellular ion pair NaCO3- exchanges for intracellular Cl-. In the present study, the ion-pair model was tested by examining the interaction of the reversible stilbene derivative 4,4'-dinitrostilbene- 2,2'-disulfonate (DNDS) with extracellular Na+ and HCO3-. Axons (initial pHi approximately 7.4) were internally dialyzed with a pH 6.5 solution containing 400 mM Cl- but no Na+. After pHi, as measured with a glass microelectrode, had fallen to approximately 6.6, dialysis was halted. In the presence of both external Na+ and HCO3- (pHo = 8.0, 22 degrees C), pHi increased due to the pHi-regulating mechanism. At a fixed [Na+]o of 425 mM and [HCO3-]o of 12 mM, DNDS reversibly reduced the equivalent acid-extrusion rate (JH) calculated from the rate of pHi recovery. The best-fit value for maximal inhibition was 104%, and for the [DNDS]o at half-maximal inhibition, 0.3 mM. At a [Na+]o of 425 mM, the [HCO3-]o dependence of JH was examined at 0, 0.1, and 0.25 mM DNDS. Although Jmax was always approximately 20 pmol cm-2 s-1, Km(HCO3-) was 2.6, 5.7, and 12.7 mM, respectively. Thus, DNDS is competitive with HCO3-. At a [HCO3-]o of 12 mM, the [Na+]o dependence of JH was examined at 0 and 0.1 mM DNDS. Although Jmax was approximately 20 pmol cm-2 s-1 in both cases, Km(Na+) was 71 and 179 mM, respectively. At a [HCO3-]o of 48 mM, Jmax was approximately 20 pmol cm-2 s-1 at [DNDS]o levels of 0, 0.1, and 0.25 mM. However, Km(Na+) was 22, 45, and 90 mM, respectively. Thus, DNDS (an anion) is also competitive with Na+. The results are consistent with simple competition between DNDS and NaCO3-, and place severe restrictions on other kinetic models.
