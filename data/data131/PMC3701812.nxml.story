In a recent issue of Nature, an article appeared discussing the issue of “Sizing up a slow assault on Cancer” (Nature 2013;496:14-15). This article attempted to clarify various approaches that the clinician might employ in bringing cancer under control. It also discussed the role of the immune system with regard to its capability for controlling tumor growth. In addition, it covered possible directions that might be taken to improve present responses to immunotherapy based on utilizing T-cell activity directed against the tumor. While there is some validity to the concept that cell mediated immunity is utilized by the host in its attempt to control evolving malignancy, this process actually represents only a minor role taken by the hosts immune system to accomplish what is needed for tumor control. Clinical studies at Precision Biologics have demonstrated that for tumor growth to be effected properly by the hosts immune system, expression of a specific humoral IgG1 response directed against immunogenic tumor glycoproteins on the cell surface membrane, constitutes the primary method needed for tumor control. Failure to obtain significant levels of the needed IgG response almost invariably results in recurrence and progression of disease.
