General Practitioners suffer from guideline fatigue. They come fast and furious in many complicated forms. Cow’s milk allergy (CMA) is one of the most common presentations of food allergy seen in early childhood presenting to primary and secondary care. The early and accurate diagnosis continues to be highlighted in many countries worldwide. International surveys have found that primary care clinicians would like clearer explanations for the options for the diagnosis of CMA and in so doing a means to increase their understanding of management options for both IgE and Non IgE mediated CMA. In 2013 in response to General Practitioner demands, the UK guideline, ‘Diagnosis and management of non-IgE-mediated CMA in infancy—a UK primary care practical guide’ was published in this journal. This Milk Allergy in Primary Care (MAP) guideline outlines in simple algorithmic form how to diagnose, manage and refer children with CMA in a primary care setting. Based on the international uptake of the MAP guideline, a global practical guideline International MAP is presented by the Venter and Brown et al to help practitioners in primary care settings. It incorporates further published UK guidance, feedback from UK healthcare professionals and affected families and, importantly, also international guidance and expertise.
