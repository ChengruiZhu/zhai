One of the fundamental problems in biology is understanding how phenotypic variations arise among individuals in a population. Recent research has shown that phenotypic variations can arise due to probabilistic cell-fate decisions driven by inherent randomness (noise) in the process of gene expression. One of the manifestations of such stochasticity in gene expression is the production of mRNAs and proteins in bursts. Bursting in gene expression is known to impact cell-fate in diverse systems ranging from latency in HIV-1 viral infections to cellular differentiation. Recent single-cell experiments provide evidence for complex arrival processes leading to bursting, however an analytical framework connecting such burst arrival processes with the corresponding higher moments of mRNA/protein distributions is currently lacking. We address this issue by invoking a mapping between general models of gene expression and systems studied in queueing theory. The framework developed and the results derived lead to new approaches for testing commonly used assumptions in modeling gene expression and for accurate estimation of burst parameters. Notably, the phenomenon of stochastic bursting has been observed in a wide range of disciplines ranging from neuroscience and finance to cell biology. The approaches developed and results obtained in this work will thus contribute towards quantitative characterization of burst processes in diverse systems of current interest.
