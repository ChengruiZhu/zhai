Cell division requires coordination of many different cellular components. Cytokinesis is the process by which the cytoplasm divides between the two forming daughter cells. During cytokinesis, centralspindlin is truly central, as it organizes microtubule bundle structures, recruits other factors to the site of division, and anchors the plasma membrane at the inter-cellular bridge while the two daughter cells are waiting for the final separation. Centralspindlin is a heterotetramer composed of two molecules of a kinesin-6 motor subunit, MKLP1, and two molecules of the second subunit, CYK4. For efficient microtubule bundling, both the microtubule motor subunit MKLP1 and the non-motor CYK4 subunit are required. However, it has remained unclear how CYK4 contributes to this activity. Here, we took a combinatorial approach to investigate this process, using in vitro reconstitution and structural analyses by atomic force microscopy and FÃ¶rster resonance energy transfer. We revealed that the CYK4 dimer binds to a hitherto unknown globular domain at the neck of the MKLP1 dimer and optimizes the configuration of two motor domains, making them suitable for antiparallel microtubule bundling. This provides novel insight into how other kinesin superfamily molecules with non-canonical neck structures may work.
