Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs), a major component of cancer stroma, play an important role in cancer progression but little is known about how CAFs affect tumorigenesis and development. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small non-coding RNAs that can negatively regulate target mRNA expression at post-transcriptional levels. In head and neck cancer (HNC), our analysis of miRNA arrays showed that miR-7, miR-196 and miR-335 were significantly up-regulated in CAFs when compared with their paired normal fibroblasts (NFs). FAP, Î±-SMA and FSP, specific markers of CAFs, were significantly expressed in CAFs. Functionally, exogenous expression of miR-7 in NFs induced a functional conversion of NFs into CAFs. In contrast, inhibition of miR-7 expression in CAFs could induce a functional conversion of CAFs into NFs. Our study demonstrated that overexpression of miR-7 in NFs significantly increased the migration activity and growth rates of cancer cells in co-culture experiments. Mechanistically, we confirmed that the RASSF2-PAR-4 axis was mainly responsible for miR-7 functions in CAFs using bioinformatics methods. Overexpression of miR-7 in CAFs led to down-regulation of RASSF2, which dramatically decreased the secretion of PAR-4 from CAFs and then enhanced the proliferation and migration of the co-cultured cancer cells. Thus, these results reveal that the inactivation of the RASSF2-PAR-4 axis controlled by miR-7 may be a novel strategy for gene therapy in HNCs.
