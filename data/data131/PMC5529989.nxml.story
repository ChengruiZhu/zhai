The aim of the present study was to investigate the association between the BRAF V600E mutation and ultrasound features of the thyroid in papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC). Fresh thyroid carcinoma tissue and paracarcinoma tissue were obtained from 34 patients undergoing surgery for PTC. The BRAF V600E mutation was detected by PCR amplification and direct DNA sequencing. The thyroid ultrasound results were compared between patients with and without the BRAF V600E mutation. Eighteen out of 34 cases were identified with the BRAF V600E mutation (52.9%), while 16 cases did not have the BRAF V600E mutation (47.1%). Additionally, no BRAF V600E mutation was detected in paracarcinoma tissue in the 34 cases. The results of ultrasound imaging suggested that there were no significant differences in tumor size, whether the border was clear, or in tumor calcification (presence or absence) between patients with and without BRAF V600E mutation (P>0.05). The BRAF V600E mutation rate was high in patients with PTC. There was no significant correlation between BRAF V600E mutation and thyroid ultrasound features. Thyroid ultrasound features are therefore unable to predict the presence of the BRAF V600E mutation in patients with PTC.
