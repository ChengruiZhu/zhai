We analyzed the transport of KCl solutions through the bacterial cellulose membrane and concentration boundary layers (CBLs) near membrane with pressure differences on the membrane. The membrane was located in horizontal-plane between two chambers with different KCL solutions. The membrane was located in horizontal-plane between two chambers with different KCL solutions. As results from the elaborated model, gradient of KCL concentration in CBLs is maximal at membrane surfaces in the case when pressure difference on the membrane equals zero. The amplitude of this maximum decreases with time of CBLs buildup. Application of mechanical pressure gradient in the direction of gradient of osmotic pressure on the membrane causes a shift of this maximum into the chamber with lower concentration. In turn, application of mechanical pressure gradient directed opposite to the gradient of osmotic pressure causes the appearance of maximum of concentration gradient in chamber with higher concentration. Besides, the increase of time of CBLs buildup entails a decrease of peak height and shift of this peak further from the membrane. Similar behavior is observed for distribution of energy dissipation in CBLs but for pressure difference on the membrane equal to zero the maximum of energy dissipation is observed in the chamber with lower concentration. We also measured time characteristics of voltage in the membrane system with greater KCl concentrations over the membrane. We can state that mechanical pressure difference on the membrane can suppress or strengthen hydrodynamic instabilities visible as pulsations of measured voltage. Additionally, time of appearance of voltage pulsations, its amplitude, and frequency depend on mechanical pressure differences on the membrane and initial quotient of KCl concentrations in chambers.
