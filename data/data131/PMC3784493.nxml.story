Inflammation is driven by inflammatory mediators. Interleukin 17A (IL-17) is implicated in chronic and severe inflammation and exaggerates production of inflammatory mediators. This is due, at least in part, to the IL-17-attenuated degradation of mRNAs encoding these inflammatory mediators, but the underlying mechanism has remained elusive. Most of these mRNAs contain AU-rich elements in their 3â€²-untranslated region and are targeted by AU-binding proteins (AUBps) that promote either mRNA degradation or stabilization. Here we show that IL-17 directs the AU-mediated mRNA degradation (AMD pathway) by modulating the interaction of degrading and stabilizing AUBps via microRNA16 (miR16). Whereas microRNAs target mRNAs to the RISC pathway for degradation by binding to a seed sequence, miR16 drives degradation by the AMD pathway without an apparent seed sequence. Transcriptome analyses have revealed that the expression of 8% of all eukaryotic transcripts is dependent on the AMD pathway. Therefore, the impact of IL-17 on inflammatory diseases may extend beyond the production of inflammatory mediators to processes like tissue repair, cell cycle, etc. In addition, targeting AUBp and/or miR16 may provide a novel therapeutic option to combat the IL-17 axis of inflammation.
