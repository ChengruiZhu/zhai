Gastric cancer (GC) is the second leading cause of global cancer mortality. Most GC patients are diagnosed with advanced-stage disease and show extremely poor prognosis. All of the GC research has a common interest to search for the specific and sensitive biomarkers for early diagnosis of GC. Number of microRNAs play important role in GC. We carried out a systematic review of published miRNA profiling studies that compared the miRNA expression profiles between GC tissues and paired noncancerous gastric tissue. A vote-counting strategy was followed with the collection of information like total number of studies reporting differential expression of miRNA, total number of tissue samples used in the studies, direction of differential expression and fold change. A total of 352 differentially expressed microRNAs were reported in the 14 microRNA expression profiling studies that compared GC tissues with normal tissues with 120 microRNAs reported at least in two studies. In the group of consistently reported microRNAs, miR-21 was reported upregulated in 10 studies followed by miR-25, miR-92, and miR-223 upregulated in eight studies. MiR-375 and miR-148a were found downregulated in six and five studies, respectively, followed by miR-638 in four studies. MiR-107 and miR-103 were reported in nine and eight studies, respectively, but their expression were inconsistent. From this study, the most consistently reported upregulated microRNA was found to be miR-21. This systematic review study of human GC microRNA expression profiling studies would provide information on microRNAs with potential role as the biomarkers in gastric cancer.
