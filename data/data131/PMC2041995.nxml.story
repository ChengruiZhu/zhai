Mammals are a fairly young class of animals, first appearing about 70 million years ago. Such recent common descent does not allow the evolutionary process to create much diversity within the class, and indeed, the physiology among different mammals is remarkably similar. This similarity enables the use of various small mammals, especially rats and mice, as model systems for the study of biological phenomenon and disease. Experiments unfeasible or unethical to perform on humans are conducted on these model animals, with the postulation that insights gained from them are applicable to the human system. In this article, we present an exception to this rule. We bring evidence that ZIPK, a gene with important roles in programmed cell death, has undergone accelerated evolution in the rat and mouse, thus diverging considerably from a well-conserved consensus in all vertebrates, from fish to man. We also show that this sequence divergence caused changes in the protein's properties, including its localization within the cell, and the proteins with which it interacts. Still, the basic biologic function of ZIPK is conserved in both systems, and we propose an adaptive mechanism that compensates for the sequence divergence in rodents.
