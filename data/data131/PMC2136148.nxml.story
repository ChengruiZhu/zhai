) a plateau which represented a decrement in the rate of viral production. This pattern of viral multiplication occurred in monkey testicular tissue cultures which have as the liquid phase either ox serum ultrafiltrate or monkey serum-chicken embryonic extract medium. The presence of a solid medium composed of chicken plasma, clotted either with chicken embryonic extract or bovine thrombin, did not alter the pattern of viral multiplication. The shape of the growth curve as established by any of four different techniques for tissue cultivation, was shown to be independent of the cultural technique employed. For cultures of monkey testicular tissue, the amount of virus in the tissue was as much as tenfold greater than that in the liquid of the same cultures. Moreover, viral production was evident earlier and was detectable for a longer period of time in the tissue than in the liquid phase. The rapidly incremental phase of the growth cycle, when large quantities of virus were released into the liquid phase, coincided in time with the destruction of the spindle-shaped cells, which extended from the explants. Although destruction of outgrowth cells was marked, there remained cells within the explants capable of supporting the growth of poliomyelitis virus.
