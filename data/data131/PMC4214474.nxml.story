Carcinosarcoma of the breast is an extremely rare and clinically aggressive tumor possessing carcinomatous components and malignant mesenchymal elements, with few cases reported in the literature. The prognosis of breast carcinosarcoma is poor when compared with more common types of breast cancer, such as ductal or lobular carcinoma. Furthermore, carcinosarcoma presents a diagnostic and therapeutic challenge due to the diversity in histology pattern and the lack of consensus regarding diagnostic criteria and effective systemic management. A 51-year-old female presented to the Department of Medical Oncology of the Second Affiliated Hospital of Zhejiang University (Hangzhou, China) with the complaint of lumbago and physical examination revealed a small mass in the right breast near the areola. Mammography and magnetic resonance imaging revealed two small masses, which were <1 cm in diameter. Positron emission tomography/computed tomography showed a maximum standardized uptake volume of 3.46 for one soft tissue nodule and multiple bones that were exhibiting radioactive enhancement. The patient was diagnosed with a breast carcinosarcoma with bone metastases and breast intraductal carcinoma. The response to chemotherapy was poor and the patient succumbed to the disease within one month of diagnosis.
