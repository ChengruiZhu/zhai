The formation of new and distinct species during evolution often occurs in rapid bursts of diversification in which many species arise within a short time frame. The ecological and genetic factors that promote these radiations are much debated. Here, we examine genome-wide patterns of molecular evolution that accompanied a rapid adaptive radiation among 13 species of wild tomato—the ecologically and reproductively diverse group that gave rise to the domesticated tomato. By analyzing patterns of genetic variation in thousands of expressed genes from multiple populations and species, we identify genome-wide signatures of rapid consecutive speciation events during 2.5 million years of diversification in this group. These signatures include pervasive shared ancestral variation and frequently discordant signals of relatedness among different parts of the genome. Our analyses find evidence for three unique sources of genetic variation that fuel adaptive diversification in this group—postspeciation hybridization, rapid accumulation of new mutations, and recruitment from ancestral variation—and identify specific examples of putatively adaptive loci drawn from each source. Recent analyses of other rapid radiations have also inferred a role for at least one of these mechanisms; our finding of all three simultaneously at work within the same diversifying clade suggests that they might be a universal feature of rapid adaptation to diverse environmental niches.
