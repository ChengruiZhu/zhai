A total of 94 shoulders met inclusion criteria and had sufficient follow-up data to be included in the study. Of these, 24% were professional athletes (19% NFL, 3% MLB, 1% NBA, 1% NHL), 31% were college athletes, 33% were high school athletes and the remaining played recreationally. Of these, 61% were classified as “collision” and 29% as “limited contact” sports. 22% were overhead athletes. A total of 78 primary repairs and 16 revision repairs were performed using the same arthroscopic technique with an average of 5.6 anchors. The recurrence rate was 6/94 (6.4%) at a mean follow-up of 4.3 years (range 2.3 - 8.3). The mean postoperative scores were as follows: ASES=91.5/100; Rowe=84.3/100; VAS=0.8/10; satisfaction=8.8/10. Return to sports at the previous level for at least one season was possible in 88% of patients. Statistical analyses revealed a significant increase in risk of recurrence amongst high school and recreational athletes. No recurrences were observed amongst professional or college level athletes. No significant difference in recurrence rates were observed in regards to age, time to surgery, type of athlete (collision vs limited contact), repair of SLAP lesion, number of anchors, overhead athlete or revision surgery.
