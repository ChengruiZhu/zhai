We have been able to isolate clones of sperm whale muscle myoglobin (Mb)-reactive T cells from (C57BL/6 x A/J)F1 [(B6A)F1] mice. Four types of clones were isolated, distinguished by their patterns of recognition of Mb cyanogen bromide (CNBr) fragments and antigen presenting cell (APC) requirements. Individual T cell clones proliferated in response to one of three CNBr fragments of Mb. Dose-response curves of all clones were identical for native Mb and the appropriate fragment. T cell clones reactive to fragment 1-55 did not proliferate in response to peptide 15-22 (a peptide that binds to serum antibody directed against 1-55). These data support previous findings suggesting differences between antigen recognition by T and B cells, i.e., T cells may not recognize antigen in its native conformation and/or T and B cells may recognize distinct epitopes on the same antigen. Using T cell clones to analyze genetic control of responsiveness to Mb, we found that certain (B6A)F1 T cells recognize Mb presented by low responder strain APC. Thus, genetically determined low responsiveness in this case is probably not due to failure of APC function. We also found that responsiveness to certain Mb epitopes mapped to the I-A subregion whereas others mapped, via gene complementation, to the I-A and I-E subregions. We found no examples of responsiveness mapping to the I-C subregion and suggest an alternative explanation for previous reports mapping genetic control of responsiveness to certain Mb determinants to I-C.
