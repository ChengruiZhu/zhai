The endogenous ATP can be regarded as a substrate and an allosteric modulator in cellular signal transduction. We analyzed the properties of allosteric and substrate ATP-binding sites and found that the allosteric ATP-binding sites are less conserved than the substrate ATP-binding sites. Allosteric ATP molecules adopt both compact and extended conformations in the allosteric binding sites, while substrate ATP molecules adopt extended conformations in the substrate binding sites. The two different conformational characteristics may be responsible for ATP to exert distinct biological functions in cell signaling. In addition, to our knowledge, this study illuminates the first comprehensive atomic level investigations of ATP access to the corresponding allosteric and substrate ATP-binding sites. Specially, both the adenine and triphosphate parts of ATP could be an allosteric trigger to propagate the signal from the allosteric to functional sites. The detailed mechanism presented in this study may apply to other enzymes in complex with allosteric or substrate ATP molecules, and provide important insights for the molecular basis of ATP acting as a substrate and an allosteric modulator in cell signaling.
