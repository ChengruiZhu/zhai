All athletes were male, with an average age of 34.4 years (range 23-59). The patient cohort consisted of 4 professional NFL players and 36 recreational athletes. Average follow-up duration was 2.5 years (range 2 - 6.0 years). The most common mechanisms of injury occurred during the bench press (n=26) and contact sport participation (n=14). Sixteen injuries were complete avulsions involving both the clavicular and sternocostal heads, while 24 were isolated sternocostal head avulsions. Average pre-injury bench press of 396 lbs (range 170-500 lbs) was restored to 241 lbs post-operatively (range 140-550 lbs). Single Assessment Numeric Evaluation (SANE) scores averaged 93.6 (range 62-100) with an average overall patient satisfaction rated at 9.6 out of 10 (range 6-10). All athletes returned to their pre-injury level of activity at average 5.5 months post-op (range 4.5-6.5 months). Isokinetic evaluation assessing adduction strength revealed an average decrease of <11% (avg. 9.9%, range -18 - 41%) compared with the contralateral extremity. Application of the Bak criteria revealed 50% of athletes scored as excellent, 35% as good and 15% as fair. One athlete developed a pulmonary embolus 10 days post-op. Two athletes required a 2nd surgery (5%), both were re-injured within 3 weeks of surgery.
