Accurate assessment of the aortic valve area (AVA) and evaluation of the aortic root are important for clinical decision-making in patients being considered for transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI). Real-time three-dimensional transesophageal echocardiography (RT3D-TEE) provides accurate and reliable quantitative assessment of aortic valve stenosis and the aortic root. We performed two-dimensional transthoracic echocardiography (2D-TTE), real-time 2D transesophageal echocardiography (RT2D-TEE) and RT3D-TEE in 71 consecutive patients referred for TAVI. RT3D-TEE multiplanar reconstruction was used to measure aortic root parameters, including left ventricular outflow tract (LVOT) diameter and area, aortic annulus diameter, aortic annulus area, and AVA. RT3D-TEE methods for planimetry and the LVOT-derived continuity equation for the estimation of AVA showed a good correlation. As iatrogenic coronary ostium occlusion is a potentially life-threatening complication, we evaluated the distances from the aortic annulus to the coronary ostia using RT3D-TEE. Based on our findings, we conclude that the geometry of the aortic root and aortic valve can be reliably and feasibly evaluated using RT3D-TEE, which is important for protecting against potential complications of TAVI, such as underestimation of the size of the aortic annulus that can result in aortic regurgitation and dislocation of the valve, or overestimation can lead to annulus rupture.
