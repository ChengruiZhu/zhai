There were 127 patients that met the inclusion criteria, including 63 patients in the NB group (32 males, 31 females) and 64 patients in the control group (26 males, 38 females). There were no significant differences between the NB group and the control group with respect to age (15.7 ± 1.4 vs. 15.5 ± 1.4, p = 0.26), sex (p = 0.29), BMI (23.7 ± 3.6 vs. 23.8 ± 3.6, p = 0.91), or type of graft used (67% patellar tendon autograft, 33% hamstring autograft vs. 70% patellar tendon autograft, 30% hamstring autograft, p = 0.85). Univariate analysis showed a significantly higher deficit at six months in the NB group with respect to fast isokinetic extension strength (17.6% vs. 11.3%, p = 0.008), as well as fast (12.8% vs. 8.3%, p = 0.029) and slow (9.9% vs. 5.5%, p = 0.029) isokinetic flexion strength. There was no difference in slow extension isokinetic strength deficit between the two groups (NB 22.1% vs. control 18.9%, p = 0.246).. With respect to function, there were no differences in deficit for vertical jump (NB 9.3% vs. control 11.3%, p = 0.267), single hop (NB 7.5% vs. control 7.6%, p = 0.970), or triple hop (NB 7.9% vs. control 6.5%, p = 0.375) between the two groups. A higher percentage of patients in the control group met criteria for return to sports at six months. (88.9% vs. 68.3%, p = 0.008).
