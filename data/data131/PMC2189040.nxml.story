A panel of mutant class II genes have been constructed using site- directed mutagenesis and DNA-mediated gene transfer. Using this technique, Ak beta polypeptides have been altered by substituting one or more Ad beta-specific residues at polymorphic positions in the beta 1 domain. Transfection of M12.C3 B lymphoma cells with most mutant Ak beta* genes results in the expression of Ak beta* Ad alpha molecules on the cell surface. However, the substitution of a single d allele residue at position 78 or 86 in the Ak beta polypeptide results in either the complete absence or very low levels, respectively, of cell surface expression of the Ak beta* Ad alpha molecule, but does not alter Ak beta* Ak alpha expression. The T.86 Ak beta* Ad alpha is expressed primarily in an intracellular compartment while the T.78 Ak beta* molecule does not appear to be produced. The core-glycosylated T.78 Ak beta* polypeptide does, however, form a complex intracellularly with the core-glycosylated Ii polypeptide. Substitution of the combination of d allele residues at Ak beta polymorphic positions 9, 12, 13, 14, and 17 results in the absence of Ak beta* Ak alpha cell surface expression but does not alter the expression of this mutant Ak beta* polypeptide with the Ad alpha polypeptide. These allele-specific expression mutants demonstrate that substitution at certain beta 1 domain positions may result in the alteration of Ia cell surface expression and that the transport of Ia molecules from the Golgi apparatus to the cell surface may be regulated by signals that are determined by the interaction of polymorphic residues in both the alpha and beta polypeptides.
