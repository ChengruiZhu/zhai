7-Oxysterols are major toxic components in oxidized low-density lipoprotein and human atheroma lesions, which cause lysosomal membrane permeabilization (LMP) and cell death. Autophagy may function as a survival mechanism in this process. Here, we investigated whether 7-oxysterols mixed in an atheroma-relevant proportion induce autophagy, whether autophagy induction influences 7-oxysterol-mediated cell death, and the underlying mechanisms, by focusing on cellular lipid levels, oxidative stress, and LMP in 7-oxysterol-treated macrophages. We found that 7-oxysterols induced cellular lipid accumulation, autophagy dysfunction, and cell death in the form of both apoptosis and necrosis. Exposure to 7-oxysterols induced autophagic vacuole synthesis in the form of increased autophagy marker microtubule-associated protein 1A/1B-light chain 3 (LC3) and LC3-phosphatidylethanolamine conjugate (LC3-II) and autophagic vacuole formation. This led to an accumulation of p62, indicating a reduction in autophagic vacuole degradation. Importantly, autophagy induction significantly reduced 7-oxysterol-mediated cell death by diminishing LMP and oxidative stress. Moreover, autophagy induction minimized cellular lipid accumulation induced by 7-oxysterols. These findings highlight the importance of autophagy in combating cellular stress, LMP, and cell death in atherosclerosis. Therefore, activation of the autophagy pathway may be a potential therapeutic strategy for prevention of necrotic core formation in atherosclerotic lesions.
