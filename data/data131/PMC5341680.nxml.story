After obtaining institutional ethics committee approval, 60 patients posted for thyroid and major neck surgeries under American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) grade I and II were recruited for the study. Written informed consent was obtained. Pre-operatively indirect laryngoscopy was performed in all the patients to assess baseline vocal cord function. All patients were premedicated and induced and maintained as per standardized anaesthesia protocol. Patients were randomized using a sealed envelope technique to either Group K where intubation was performed using Kings vision laryngoscope or Group T where intubation was performed using True view laryngoscope. Glottis visualization was graded in all patients and intubated. Ten minutes prior to extubation injection. dexmedetomidine 1 Î¼g/kg was administered. Once patients satisfied extubation criteria, laryngoscopy was performed using respective video-laryngoscope in each group, patient extubated under vision and assessed for vocal cord visualization and mobility grade (VMG) and patient reactivity score (PRS). Heart rate, systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure and mean arterial pressure was also noted. Total intraoperative morphine consumption was recorded. Vocal cord function was assessed again before the day of discharge by indirect laryngoscopy.
