The diffusion of useful information in generalized networks, such as those consisting of wireless physical substrates and social network overlays is very important for theoretical and practical applications. Contrary to previous works, we focus on the impact of user interest and its features (e.g., interest periodicity) on the dynamics and control of diffusion of useful information within such complex wireless-social systems. By considering the impact of temporal and topical variations of users interests, e.g., seasonal periodicity of interest in summer vacation advertisements which spread more effectively during Springâ€“Summer months, we develop an epidemic-based mathematical framework for modeling and analyzing such information dissemination processes and use three indicative operational scenarios to demonstrate the solutions and results that can be obtained by the corresponding differential equation-based formalism. We then develop an optimal control framework subject to the above information diffusion modeling that allows controlling the trade-off between information propagation efficiency and the associated cost, by considering and leveraging on the impact that user interests have on the diffusion processes. By analysis and extensive simulations, significant outcomes are obtained on the impact of each network layer and the associated interest parameters on the dynamics of useful information diffusion. Furthermore, several behavioral properties of the optimal control of the useful information diffusion with respect to the number of infected/informed nodes and the evolving user interest are shown through analysis and verified via simulations. Specifically, a key finding is that low interest-related diffusion can be aided by utilizing proper optimal controls. Our work in this paper paves the way towards this user-centered information diffusion framework.
