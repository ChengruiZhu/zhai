In the present study, we examined the gastroprotective effect of selenium against ethanol-induced gastric mucosal lesions in rats. The gastric mucosal lesions were produced by oral administration with various concentrations of ethanol for three days, and 80% ethanol treatment was determined to be the optimal condition for induction of gastric damage. To identify the protective effect of selenium on ethanol-induced gastric damage, various doses of selenium were given as pretreatment for three days, and then gastric damage was induced by 80% ethanol treatment. Selenium showed a protective effect against ethanol-induced gastric mucosal lesions in a dose dependent manner. Specifically, 100 μg/kg selenium showed the highest level of gastroprotection. In addition, selenium markedly attenuated ethanol-induced lipid peroxidation in gastric mucosa and increased activities of radical scavenging enzymes, such as superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase, and glutathione peroxidase in a dose-dependent manner. Histological data showed that 100 μg/kg selenium distinctly reduced the depth and severity of the ethanol induced gastric lesion. These results clearly demonstrate that selenium inhibits the formation of ethanol-induced gastric mucosal lesions through prevention of lipid peroxidation and activation of enzymatic radical scavenging.
