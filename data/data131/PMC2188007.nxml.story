The primary antigen-specific antibody response of various strains of mice to TEPC-15/PnC immune complexes has been examined. We found that both BALB/c and C3H mice were good responders to the PnC antigen; however, C3H mice were low responders, whereas BALB/c mice were high responders to the TEPC-15/PnC complexes. Using congenic strains on the C3H and BALB/c background, we have shown that the response to the complexes is not restricted by gene products of the H-2 complex or by the Igh (allotype) locus. However, responsiveness may be controlled by genes linked to the Igh locus, since we have shown that strains that are Ighj, Ighd, and Ighf are low responders, whereas strains that are Igha, Ighb, and Ighe are high responders to the immune complex. Moreover, responsiveness correlates with the expression of the T15 Id as measured using the anti-T15 monoclonal antibody, AB1-2. Thus, strains such as BALB/c, BALB.B, BALB.K, and CB-20, which express high levels of T15 (AB1-2) Id in their PFC response to PnC are relatively high responders to TEPC-15/PnC complexes, whereas C3H, C3H.SW, and C3H- OH, which express low levels of the T15 (AB1-2) Id, are low responders to the complexes. Finally, we found that BALB/c mice are high responders to complexes formed with T15+ antibodies, whereas they are low responders to complexes formed using T15- antibodies. The results suggest that the antigen-specific response to these immune complexes is Id-restricted.
