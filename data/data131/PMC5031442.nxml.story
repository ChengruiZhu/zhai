Osteoblasts, which are the cells that produce bone, line the inner surface of the bone and are adjacent to the marrow that generates all the different blood cells. Osteoblasts have a close relationship with hematopoiesis, and it has been shown that a transient elimination of osteoblasts leads to the decrease of hematopoietic stem cells and progenitor cells. Fibronectin (FN) is an extracellular matrix protein with a known role in hematopoiesis in vitro that is secreted by osteoblasts. Here, we analyze the role of FN in hematopoiesis and find that an isoform that contains the extra domain A (EDA) and is produced by the osteoblasts affects both the number and future behavior of a subset of immune cells. EDA-FN protects against excessive fibrotic tissue formation in a liver fibrosis model. The same process, however, is detrimental in cancer, because it prevents the organism from mounting a potent immune response against the cancer and induces an increase of cancer growth. Mechanistically, we find that the EDA domain binds to the cell surface receptor α5β1 integrin and enhances the production of the anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive factor arginase-1. We conclude that EDA-FN production by osteoblasts modulates immune cell behavior, and that interfering with this mechanism opens up new possibilities for enhancing an immune reaction against cancer.
