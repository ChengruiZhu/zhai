As high-throughput technologies for molecular abundance profiling are becoming more inexpensive and accessible, computational inference of gene interaction networks from such data based on well-founded statistical principles is imperative to advance the understanding of regulatory mechanisms in various biological systems. Reverse engineering of gene networks has traditionally relied on analysis of whole-genome microarray data; here we present a new method, GINI, to infer gene networks from ISH images, thereby enabling exploration of spatial characteristics of gene expressions for network inference. Our method generates a Markov network, which encapsulates globally meaningful statistical-dependencies from vector-valued gene spatial patterns. In other words, we advance the state-of-art in both the usage of richer forms of expression data, and the employment of principled statistical methodology for sound network inference on such new form of data. Our results show that analyzing the spatial distribution of gene expression enables us to capture information not available from microarray data. Such an analysis is especially important in analyzing genes involved in embryonic development of Drosophila to reveal specific spatial patterning that determines the development of the 14 segments of the adult fly.
