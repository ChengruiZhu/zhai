Radiofrequency ablation (RFA) and microwave ablation (MWA) are currently the dominant modalities to treat unresectable liver tumors. Monitoring the ablation process with b-mode-sonography is often hampered by artefacts. Furthermore, vessels may cause cooling in the adjacent tumor target (heat-sink-effect) with risk of local recurrence. The present study evaluated infrared-thermography to monitor surgical RFA/MWA and detect heat-sink-effects in real-time. RFA and MWA of perfused porcine livers was conducted at peripheral and central-vessel-adjacent locations, and monitored by real-time thermography. Ablation was measured and evaluated by gross pathology. The mean time for ablation was significantly longer in RFA compared with MWA (8 vs. 2 min). Although mean macroscopic ablation diameter was similar (RFA, 3.17 cm; MWA, 3.38 cm), RFA showed a significant heat-sink-effect compared with MWA. The surface temperature during central RFA near vessels was 1/3 lower compared with peripheral RFA (47.11±8.35°C vs. 68.72±12.70°C; P<0.001). There was no significant difference in MWA (50.52±8.35°C vs. 50.18±10.35°C; P=0.74). In conclusion, thermography is suitable to monitor the correct ablation with MWA and RFA. The results of the current study demonstrated a significant heat-sink-effect for RFA, but not MWA near vessels. MWA reaches consistent surface temperatures much faster than RFA. With further
