Abductor lesions are increasingly recognized as a source of recalcitrant laterally based hip pain and dysfunction. There is a growing body of evidence that many of these may be amenable to endoscopic repair. To report the demographic data and outcomes of endoscopic hip abductor repair. Twelve patients underwent endoscopic abductor repair with 2-year follow-up. These patients were prospectively assessed with modified Harris hip and iHOT scores. The indications for surgery were clinical and MRI findings of symptomatic abductor tears that had failed conservative treatment. All patients underwent concomitant or prior arthroscopy of the joint. Repair was performed with suture anchors using an iliotibial band-sparing endoscopic technique; followed by a 4-month structured rehabilitation protocol. Follow-up was obtained on all patients at 24 months. The average age was 56 years (range 39â€“77 years). These were all females. All demonstrated improved modified Harris hip scores, averaging 43 points (preop 42; postop 85). Eleven of 12 (92%) demonstrated improved iHOT scores, averaging 52 points (preop 21; postop 73). Ten patients had accompanying intra-articular pathology including 10 labral tears,
