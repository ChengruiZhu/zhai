To form neural circuits, axons must navigate through the developing nervous system to reach their correct targets. Axon navigation is led by the growth cone, a structure at the tip of the growing axon that responds to extracellular guidance cues. Many of these guidance cues and their receptors have been identified. However, much less is known about the internal signaling events that give rise to the structural changes required for growth cone steering. A key component of the internal response is MIG-10, a protein that becomes asymmetrically localized in response to the extracellular cues. MIG-10 is thought to serve as a scaffold that can spatially control outgrowth-promoting proteins within the growth cone. However, we do not know the identity of the outgrowth-promoting proteins that associate with MIG-10. Here we report that MIG-10 associates physically with the actin regulatory protein ABI-1. We present genetic evidence indicating that ABI-1 functions downstream of MIG-10 to mediate its outgrowth-promoting activity. Additional genetic evidence indicates that these proteins function in both attractive and repulsive guidance signaling pathways. We also present evidence suggesting that the connection between MIG-10 and ABI-1 represents a phylogenetically conserved mechanism for the control of cellular outgrowth.
