This study investigated the status of work-life imbalance among hospital nurses in Japan
and impact of work-life imbalance on job satisfaction and quality of life. A
cross-sectional survey of 1,202 nurses (81% response rate) was conducted in three Japanese
acute care hospitals. Participants were divided into four groups for actual work-life
balance (Group A: 50/50, including other lower working proportion groups [e.g., 40/50];
Group B: 60/40; Group C: 70/30; and Group D: 80/20, including other higher working
proportion groups [e.g., 90/10]). We also asked participants about desired work-life
balance, and private and work-related perspectives. Satisfactions (job, private life, and
work-life balance), quality of life, and stress-coping ability were also measured. All
data were compared among the four groups. Most nurses sensed that they had a greater
proportion of working life than private life, and had a work-life imbalance. Actual WLB
did not fit compared to desired WLB. When the actual working proportion greatly exceeds
the private life proportion, nursesâ€™ health could be in danger, and they may resign due to
lower job satisfaction and QOL. Simultaneous progress by both management and individual
nurses is necessary to improve work-life imbalance.
