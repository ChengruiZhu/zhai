 Phage coats or ghosts, composed entirely of protein, appear to be responsible for protecting the phage nucleic acid from degradation by factors in the surrounding medium; attachment of the virus to its susceptible host; and delivering the nucleic acid to the interior of the cell. In addition, the ghosts have a number of biological actions which resemble similar actions of the parent phage. Thus, they both "kill" cells, inhibit pentosenucleic acid formation, interfere with subsequent infection by other virus particles, block adaptive enzyme formation, induce or trigger lysis of the host, and cause a leakage of phosphorus-containing fragments from the cell. Results to date fail to demonstrate a direct involvement of the ghosts in the passage of genetic information to the progeny. Several of the above changes induced in the host cell following attachment of ghosts could be derived from an alteration in but a single metabolic reaction. The stoichiometry of the ghost-bacterial cell interaction is different from that of the parent phage. Experiments to distinguish between a variable response of the host cell to reaction at different sites and a state of heterogeneity in the ghost preparations suggest the former but they are not decisive.
