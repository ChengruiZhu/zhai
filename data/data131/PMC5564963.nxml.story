Patient reported outcomes (PRO) following surgery is vital to determining treatment efficacy and is valuable for executing comparative trials. Traditional legacy measures used to assess outcomes of patients undergoing arthroscopic hip surgery have included the modified Harris Hip Score (mHHS), the Non-arthritic Hip Score (NAHS) and the Hip Outcome Score (HOS), among others. Each of these PROs have been touted for specific advantages and criticized for certain limitations. In addition, clinical results documented for each of these PROs cannot be easily compared with those from other measures employed in patients undergoing different procedures in varying anatomic locations. The Patient Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) tool was developed by the National Institute of Health to provide efficient, precise and valid patient-reported outcome data. While PROMIS has been broadly utilized due to its efficiency and generalizability, it has not yet been validated among patients undergoing hip arthroscopy. The purpose of this study was to determine whether the PORMIS Computer Adaptive Testing (CAT) tool demonstrates validity against commonly used legacy PRO measures among a population of patients undergoing arthroscopic hip surgery.
