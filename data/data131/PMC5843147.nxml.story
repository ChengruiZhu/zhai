The environment in which an individual resides is likely to change how she or he responds to infection. However, most of our understanding about host responses to infection arises from experimental studies conducted under uniform environmental conditions in the laboratory. We wished to investigate whether findings in the laboratory translate into the wild. Therefore, in this study, we placed common strains of laboratory mice into large, outdoor enclosures to investigate how a more natural environment might impact their ability to combat intestinal worm infections. We found that while mice are able to clear worm infections in the laboratory, mice residing outdoors harbored higher worm burdens and larger worms than their laboratory cousins. The longer the mice lived outdoors, the greater the number and size of worms in their guts. We found that outdoor mice harbored more diverse gut microbes and even specific bacteria that may have impacted worm growth and survival inside the mice. Mice kept outdoors also produced decreased immune responses of the type essential for worm expulsion. Together, these results demonstrate that the external environment significantly alters how a host responds to worms and germs in her or his gut, thereby leading to variation in the outcome of infections.
