, number: ChiCTR-OOB-15007543). The prevalence of metabolic syndrome in breast cancer (32.6%) was obviously higher than that in control population (18.2%) (p<0.001; OR: 2.173, 95%CI: 1.793 to 2.633). With age stratification, the prevalence of metabolic syndrome in breast cancer group aged below 60 years (24.9%, p<0.001; OR: 2.216, 95%CI: 1.744 to 2.816) and equal/above 60 years (58.3%, p<0.001; OR: 2.291, 95%CI: 1.580 to 3.322) were also statistically higher than those (13.0% & 37.9%) in control population, respectively. Breast cancer women were more likely to have preobese (BMI 25.0-29.9) or obesity (BMI â‰¥30.0), broader waist circumference, lower HDL-C level, higher systolic and/or diastolic blood pressure and higher fasting blood glucose level compared to the control population, corresponding prevalence were 31.7%vs.19.4%, 76.0%vs.29.6%, 37.4%vs.30.4%, 34.2%/27.3%vs.27.6%/14.2% and 25.0%vs.20.1%, respectively (p<0.01). In summary, there is high prevalence of metabolic syndrome and its components in Chinese breast cancer women, and metabolic syndrome is closely related with breast cancer. Therefore, screening and prevention strategy of metabolic syndrome should be carried out in the management of breast cancer.
