The intramembrane particles on the presynaptic membrane and on the membrane of synaptic vesicles were studied at freeze-fractured neuromuscular junctions of the frog. The particles on the P face of the presynaptic membrane belong to two major classes: small particles with diameters less than 9 nm and large particles with diameters between 9 and 13 nm. In addition, there were a few extralarge particles with diameters greater than 13 nm. Indirect stimulation of the muscle, or the application of black widow spider venom, decreased the concentration of small particles on the presynaptic membrane but did not change the concentration of large particles. Three similar classes of particles were found on the P face of the membrane of the synaptic vesicles. The concentrations of large and extralarge particles on the vesicle membrane were comparable to the concentrations of these particles on the presynaptic membrane, whereas the concentration of small particles on the vesicle membrane was less than than the concentration of small particles on the presynaptic membrane. These results are compatible with the idea that synaptic vesicles fuse with the presynaptic membrane when quanta of transmitter are released. However, neither the large nor the extralarge particles on the P face of the presynaptic membrane can be used to trace the movement of vesicle membrane that has been incorporated into the axolemma.
