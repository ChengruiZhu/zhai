Median raphe cyst is a rare lesion located on the median raphe. The cyst wall is lined by cuboidal to columnar cells, transitional (urothelial) cells, stratified squamous cells or a mixture of these. The normal urethral mucosa and the median raphe cyst usually lack melanocytes and/or melanin pigment. However, albeit extremely rare, the presence of melanin pigment and/or melanocytes in median raphe cyst, namely pigmented median raphe cyst, has been previously reported. The current case report presents the sixth case of pigmented median raphe cyst and discusses the possible mechanism of melanocytic colonization in this tumor. A 48-year-old male presented with a nodule on the ventral surface of the penis. Histopathological study revealed that the cyst wall was covered by uniform bland cuboidal to urothelial cells. The peculiar observation was the presence of dendritic melanocytes among the epithelial cells. Therefore, a diagnosis of pigmented median raphe cyst was determined. Immunohistochemically, stem cell factor and endothelin-1 were not expressed in the epithelial cells of the cyst wall. It is well-known that melanocytes are rarely found in various non-melanocytic tumors, a phenomenon termed ‘colonization’. The mechanism by which melanocytes appear in median raphe cyst remains unclear. The present report is the first to demonstrate that melanocytic proliferation and differentiation factors, such as stem cell factor and endothelin-1, are not involved in the pigmentation of median raphe cyst. In addition, aberrant melanocytic migration may contribute to the development of this type of lesion.
