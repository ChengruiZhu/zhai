Myogenesis is an important biological process that occurs during both skeletal muscle regeneration and postnatal growth. Growing evidence points to the critical role of microRNAs (miRNAs) in myogenesis. Our analysis of miRNA expression patterns reveal that miRNAs of miR-17-92 cluster are dramatically downregulated in C2C12 cells after myogenesis stimulation, are strongly induced in mouse skeletal muscle after injury and decrease steadily thereafter and are downregulated with age in skeletal muscle during mouse and porcine postnatal growth. However, their roles in muscle developmental processes remain elusive. We show that the miR-17-92 cluster promotes mouse myoblast proliferation but inhibits myotube formation. miR-17, -20a and -92a target the actin-associated protein enigma homolog 1 (ENH1). The silencing of ENH1 increased the nuclear accumulation of the inhibitor of differentiation 1 (Id1) and represses myogenic differentiation. Furthermore, the injection of adenovirus expressing miR-20a into the tibialia anterior muscle downregulates ENH1 and delays regeneration. In addition, the downregulation of miR-17-92 during myogenesis is transcriptionally regulated by E2F1. Overall, our results reveal a E2F1/miR-17-92/ENH1/Id1 regulatory axis during myogenesis.
