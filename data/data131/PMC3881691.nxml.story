The current study presents a retrospective comparison, performed at a single academic center, of preoperative chemoradiation (CRT) and perioperative chemotherapy (CT) in addition to surgery in locally advanced but resectable adenocarcinoma of the esophagogastric junction (AEG). A total of 29 consecutive patients with locally advanced AEGs were retrospectively analyzed. Treatment consisted of preoperative CRT (mean dose, 45.0 Gy) plus two cycles of CT with cisplatin and 5-FU or perioperative CT with epirubicin, cisplatin and capecitabine (three cycles preoperatively and postoperatively). Within four to six weeks following preoperative treatment, surgical therapy was performed. Median overall survival was 21.0 months in the perioperative CT group versus 41.7 months in the CRT group [P=0.36; hazard ratio (HR), 1.50; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.58–3.84]. Three-year survival rates were 55 and 38%, respectively, in favor of the CRT group, and progression-free survival was 20.0 months in the CT group compared with 24.1 months in the CRT group (P=0.71; HR, 1.19; 95% CI, 0.46–3.05). The total number of major surgical complications was almost equal in the two groups. Margin-free resections were achieved in all patients of the CRT group, but only 76.9% of the CT group (P=0.05). In addition, significantly higher R0 resection rates and an increased number of pathological complete remissions were demonstrated in the CRT group compared with those of the CT group. These results appear to indicate a trend for improved progression-free and overall survival for the CRT group. As postoperative morbidity and mortality rates were similar in the two groups, the results support the use of CRT for patients with advanced AEG tumors.
