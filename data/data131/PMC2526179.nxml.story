Crosslinks, linking the complementary stands of the DNA double helix, can lead to cell death, because they are so effective at interfering with normal genomic transactions such as DNA replication. This property of crosslinking agents has long been utilized in cancer therapy. The purpose of our research is to understand the function of DNA repair proteins in cellular responses to DNA interstrand crosslinking agents. MSH2 is a central protein in the recognition of DNA mismatches, and we previously found that it plays an important role in protecting cells against the toxicity of crosslinks. The MLH1 protein functions in DNA mismatch repair in a later step, and we hypothesized that MLH1 may also be involved in repair of crosslinks. We were surprised to find that MLH1 function is important for DNA crosslink-induced signaling, rather than DNA repair. MLH1-deficient cells are more resistant to crosslinks and have defective signaling to processes that signal cell death. This work may have clinical consequences, as mutations in MSH2 and MLH1 are common in tumors. MSH2-deficient cells may be more vulnerable to DNA crosslink-inducing agents than normal, while MLH1-deficient cells have a greater potential to survive crosslinking treatment, which could instead potentiate further tumor initiation.
