Epithelia are the most common tissue type in multicellular organisms. Understanding processes that make them acquire their final shape has implications to pathologies such as cancer progression and birth defects such as spina bifida. During development, epithelial tissues are remodeled by mechanical forces applied at the Adherens Junctions (AJs). The AJs form a belt-like structure below the apical surface that functions to both mechanically link epithelial cells and enable cells to remodel their shape and contacts with their neighbors. In order to study epithelial morphogenesis in a quantitative and systematic way, it is necessary to measure the changes in the shape of the AJs over time. To this end we have built a complete computational pipeline to process image volumes generated by laser scanning confocal microscopy of epithelial tissues where the AJs have been marked with AJ proteins tagged with GFP. The system transforms input voxel intensity values into a symbolic description of the cells in the tissue, their connectivity and their temporal evolution, including the discovery of mitosis and apoptosis. As a proof of concept, we employed the data generated by our system to study aspects of morphogenesis of the
