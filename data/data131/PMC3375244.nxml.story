Apoptosis is a physiological form of cell death that is fundamental for development, growth and homeostasis in multi-cellular organisms. Deviations in the apoptosis machinery are known to be involved in cancer, neurodegenerative disorders, and autoimmune diseases. The proteins Bax and Bak are essential for executing apoptosis, yet the mechanism of their activation is not properly understood at the structural level. To understand this mechanism, we investigated how the electronic density is reorganized (i.e., how charge is transferred) inside the Bax molecule when Bax binds a functional peptide of its natural activator protein. We identified the specific interactions responsible for the exposure of the functional sites of Bax, rendering Bax active. Furthermore, we found a network of charge transfer that conveys activation information from the Bax activation site, through the hydrophobic core of Bax, to the well-distanced functional sites of Bax. This network consists of three residues inside the hydrophobic core of Bax, which are present also in the hydrophobic core of Bak, suggesting that these residues are functionally important and thus potential drug targets. We provide a straightforward and accessible methodology to identify the key residues involved in the fast activation of proteins during signal transduction.
