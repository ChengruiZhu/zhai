Chemicals can interact with the genetic material giving rise to the formation of covalent adducts. These alterations can lead to adverse consequences, including cancer, reproductive impairment, development anomalies, or genetic diseases. In search for an assay allowing identification of hazardous compounds that might form covalent adducts with nucleic acids, electrochemistry (EC)/liquid chromatography (LC)/mass spectrometry (MS) is presented. EC/LC/MS is a purely instrumental approach. EC is used for oxidative activation, LC for the fractionation of the reaction mixture, and MS for the detection and characterization of the reaction products. To test the system capabilities, we investigated the formation of covalent adducts produced by guanosine and acetaminophen (APAP). Electrochemical activation of mixtures of guanosine and APAP gave rise to the formation of four isomers of (guanosine + APAP-2H). Mass voltammograms as well as dose–response-curves were used to obtain insights in the mechanism of adduct formation. These experiments revealed that a mechanism involving radical intermediates is favored. The initial step of adduct formation is the conversion of both APAP and guanosine into radicals via one-electron–one-proton reactions. Among different competing reaction pathways, the generated radical intermediates undergo intermolecular reactions to form covalent adducts between guanosine and APAP.
