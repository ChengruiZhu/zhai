From 2010 to 2014, 138 biopsies received from 35 different organ sites were analysed by LCM-MS/MS using Congo Red staining to visualise amyloid deposits. There was insufficient tissue in the block for LCM for 7 cases. An amyloid forming protein was ultimately identified in 121 out of 131 attempted cases (94 %). Of the 121 successful cases, the Mayo Clinic amyloid proteomic signature (at least two of Serum Amyloid P, ApoE and ApoA4) was detected in 92 (76 %). Low levels of additional amyloid forming proteins were frequently identified with the main amyloid forming protein, which may reflect co-deposition of fibrils. Furthermore, vitronectin and clusterin were frequently identified in our samples. Adding vitronectin to the amyloid signature increases the number of positive cases, suggesting a potential 4th protein for the signature. In terms of clinical impact, amyloid typing by immunohistochemistry was attempted in 88 cases, reported as diagnostic in 39, however, 5 were subsequently revealed by proteomic analysis to be incorrect. Overall, the referring clinician’s diagnosis of amyloid subtype was altered by proteomic analysis in 24 % of cases. While LCM-MS/MS was highly robust in protein identification, clinical information was still required for subtyping, particularly for systemic versus localized amyloidosis.
