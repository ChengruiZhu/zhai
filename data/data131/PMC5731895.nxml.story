Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease is a main complication of type 2 diabetes. Isoquercitrin are employed for antidiabetic therapies, but the effects on liver function and the hepatocytes are unclear. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of isoquercitrin on the T2DM-induced hepatic injury in rats. Isoquercitrin (10 mg/kg/d, 30 mg/kg/d), sitagliptin phosphate (10 mg/kg/d) was given orally for 21 days. The administration of isoquercitrin at 10 mg/kg/d and 30 mg/kg/d showed a dose dependent. Compare to the negative control (treated with saline), rats medicated with isoquercitrin (30 mg/kg/d) and sitagliptin phosphate (10 mg/kg/d) improved the clinical symptoms, FBG and glucose tolerance, reduced serum ALT, AST and IR, but increased TP, Alb, SOD, GSH, MDA, HDL-C, INS and GLP-1. On histology, Rats of these to groups presented nearly normal liver tissue and Langerhans, degeneration, necrosis and apoptosis were markedly reduced. Instead, hepatocytes showed regenerate. These two groups also showed significant increase in mRNA expression of PKA, AKT, PKCa, InsR and PI3K, and a decrease in DPP-IV mRNA level. These results indicated that treatment with isoquercitrin protects against hepatic injury by T2DM.
