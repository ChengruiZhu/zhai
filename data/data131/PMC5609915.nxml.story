Global DNA hypomethylation in leukocytes has been associated with increased risk for a variety of cancers. However, the role of leukocyte global DNA hypomethylation in glioma development, if any, is largely unknown. To define this role, we performed a case-control study with 390 glioma patients and 390 controls with no known cancer. Levels of 5-methylcytosine (5-mC%), a marker for global DNA methylation, were measured in leukocyte DNA. Overall, median levels of 5-mC% were significantly lower in glioma cases than in controls (3.45 vs 3.82, P=0.001). Levels of 5-mC% differed significantly by age and sex among controls and by tumor subtype and grade among glioma cases. In multivariate analysis, lower levels of 5-mC% were associated with a 1.31-fold increased risk of glioma (odds ratio = 1.31, 95% confidence interval = 1.10-1.41). A significant dose-response trend was observed in quartile analysis (P=0.001). In an analysis further stratified by clinical characteristics at baseline, the association between lower levels of 5-mC% and glioma risk was evident only among younger participants (age <52 years), women, and those with aggressive tumor characteristics, such as glioblastoma subtype, high tumor grade (grade III or IV), and absence of
