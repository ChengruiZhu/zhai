Extracting and characterizing small signals in a noisy background is a universal problem in sensory processing. In human audition, this is referred to as the cocktail party problem. Weakly electric knifefish face a similar difficulty. Objects in their environment produce distortions in a self-generated electric field that are used for navigation and prey capture in the dark. While we know prey signals are small (microvolt range), and other environmental signals can be many times larger, we know very little about prey detection in a natural electrosensory landscape. To better understand this problem, we present an analysis of small object discrimination and detection using a recently developed model of the fish's electric field. We show that the electric sense is extremely blurry: two prey must be about five diameters apart to produce distinct signals. But this blurriness can be an asset when prey must be detected in a background of large distracters. We show that the commonly observed “knife-like” scanning behaviour of these fish causes a prey signal to “pop-out” from the blurry background signal. Our study is the first to our knowledge to describe specific motion-generated electrosensory cues, and it provides a novel example of how self-motion can be used to enhance sensory processing.
