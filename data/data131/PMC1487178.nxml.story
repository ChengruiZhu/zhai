Now that the finished reference sequence of the human genome is available, focus has shifted towards understanding fundamental aspects of its functions. Meiotic recombination between maternal and paternal chromosomes serves an important mechanistic and evolutionary role in the transmission of the genome. Although significant progress has been made towards fine-mapping meiotic recombination events along human chromosomes, the characterization of factors that influence the position and frequency of crossovers remains a challenge. These authors have used data generated by the International HapMap Project as well as experimental analysis of a collection of three-generation Centre d'Etude du Polymorphisme Humain (CEPH) families, to show that chromosomal regions containing imprinted genes (i.e., genes transcribed only from one allele in a parent-of-originâ€“specific manner) exhibit higher rates of meiotic recombination than nonimprinted chromosomal regions. This characteristic is common for all major human populations. The major sequence determinants of recombination rates are likely to be different at imprinted and nonimprinted regions. Moreover, epigenetic modifications associated with imprinted regions may play an important role in increasing the frequency of meiotic crossovers and determining their position. Taken together these results suggest that a complex series of factors control meiotic recombination in the human.
