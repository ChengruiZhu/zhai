The aim of our study was to compare the results of the TTE (transthoracic echocardiography) with the results obtained by the ECG-gated 64 slices CT during the followup of patients with bicuspid aortic valve (BAV), after aortic valve replacement; in particular we evaluated the aortic root and the ascending aorta looking for a new algorithm in the followup of these patients. From January 1999 to December 2009 our attention was focused on 67 patients with isolated surgical substitution of aortic valve; after dismissal they were strictly observed. During the period between May and September 2010, these patients underwent their last evaluation, and clinical exams, ECG, TTE, and an ECG-gated-MDCT were performed. At followup TTE results showed an aortic root of 36.7 ± 4 mm and an ascending aorta of 39.6 ± 4.8 mm. ECG- gated CT showed an aortic root of 37.9 ± 5.5 mm and an ascending aorta of 43.1 ± 5.2. The comparison between preoperative and postoperative TTE shows a significant long-term dilatation of the ascending aorta while the aortic root diameter seems to be stable. ECG-gated CT confirms the stability of the aortic root diameter (38.2 ± 5.3 mm versus 37.9 ± 5.5  mm; <0.0001) and the increasing diameter value of the ascending aorta (40.2 ± 3.9 mm versus 43.1 ± 5.2 mm;
