Fitting simple models of therapy for viral diseases, such as hepatitis C virus (HCV) or human immunodeficiency virus, to patient data has yielded significant insights into the underlying viral dynamics. In general, these models assume that, once therapy is started, the drug has a constant effectiveness. More realistic assumptions are that drug effectiveness either depends directly on the drug concentration or varies over time. Here a previously introduced varying-effectiveness (VE) differential equation model is studied in the context of HCV infection. We show that the previously-unsolved VE model can be transformed into a Bessel equation and derive an analytic solution in terms of modified Bessel functions with time-varying arguments. These analytic solutions can be more readily used to fit the model to patient data than the underlying differential equations. We also find approximate solutions and establish the asymptotic behavior of the system. Typically viral load measurements exhibit a biphasic decline after therapy initiation. We show that the rate of second phase decay is determined by the death rate of infected cells multiplied by the maximum effectiveness of therapy, whereas the rate of first phase decline may depend on multiple parameters, resulting in differing first phase declines across various HCV therapies.
