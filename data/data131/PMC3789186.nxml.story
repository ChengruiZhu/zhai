Anoikis, a Bax-dependent apoptosis triggered by detachment from the extracellular matrix, is often inhibited in metastatic cancer cells. Using a couple of isogenic human colon cancer cell lines derived either from the primary tumor (SW480) or from a lymph node metastasis (SW620), we found that only SW480 cells were sensitive to anoikis. Bim upregulation but not Mcl-1 degradation was determined to be a critical factor of anoikis initiation in SW480 cells. ERK-mediated phosphorylation targets Bim for ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation. A MEK inhibitor (PD0325901) was able to increase Bim expression in SW620 cells and to sensitize these cells to anoikis. Thus, in both cell lines anoikis is under the control of proteins of the Bcl-2 family. Most interestingly, the BH3-mimetic ABT-737 was found not only to increase the level of apoptosis in suspended SW480 cells but also to sensitize SW620 cells to anoikis. Accordingly, both cell lines cultured in suspension were found to be primed for death, as determined by the detection of Bcl-2:Bim and Bcl-xL:Bim complexes. In contrast, adherent SW480 and SW620 cells were resistant to ABT-737. This indicates that, whether or not they undergo anoikis, colon cancer cells that have detached from the extracellular matrix might go through a transient state, where they are sensitive to BH3 mimetics. This would confer to compounds such as Navitoclax or ABT-199 a therapeutic window where they could have anti-metastatic potential.
