Cells in multicellular organisms are organized hierarchically. A stem cell gives rise to a chain of dividing and progressively differentiating offspring. At the end of this chain (called a lineage) are terminally differentiated cells that perform their function and undergo programmed cell death, to be replaced by new divisions of less differentiated cells. Here we are interested in the design of such lineages. At one extreme, one can imagine that a loss of terminally differentiated cells only results in divisions of cells in close hierarchical proximity to them, giving rise to very short division trees. On the other hand, it is possible that a long chain of increasingly primitive cells gets activated in response to the loss of differentiated cells. We expect that an important type of selection pressure acting upon tissue design is the minimization of mutations that happen in the course of everyday tissue maintenance (homeostasis). For example, tumor suppressor gene inactivation (two consecutive mutations) is an early rate-limiting step in many cancers. Using mathematical and computational methods, we find that the length of division trees is anti-correlated with the likelihood of double mutations, and lengthening the trees may provide an evolutionary advantage to the organism by delaying the onset of cancer.
