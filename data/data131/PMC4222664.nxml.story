Computers cannot yet recognize objects as well as humans can. Computer vision might learn from biological vision. However, neuroscience has yet to explain how brains recognize objects and must draw from computer vision for initial computational models. To make progress with this chicken-and-egg problem, we compared 37 computational model representations to representations in biological brains. The more similar a model representation was to the high-level visual brain representation, the better the model performed at object categorization. Most models did not come close to explaining the brain representation, because they missed categorical distinctions between animates and inanimates and between faces and other objects, which are prominent in primate brains. A deep neural network model that was trained by supervision with over a million category-labeled images and represents the state of the art in computer vision came closest to explaining the brain representation. Our brains appear to impose upon the visual input certain categorical divisions that are important for successful behavior. Brains might learn these divisions through evolution and individual experience. Computer vision similarly requires learning with many labeled images so as to emphasize the right categorical divisions.
