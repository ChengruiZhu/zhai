The purpose of the current study was to evaluate the anti-inflammatory activity of tetramethlpyrazine on oxazolone-induced colitis mice. Spleen mononuclear cells (SMC), lamina propria mononuclear cells (LPMC) and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) were isolated from oxazolone-induced colitis and normal mice. The colitis cells treated by oxazolone were randomly divided into model, low dose, middle dose and high dose groups treated with 0, 0.5, 1.0 and 2.0 g/L tetramethlpyrazine, respectively. The apoptotic rate of SMC and LPMC in the oxazolone-induced group was lower than that in the normal group. Compared with model group, apoptotic rate of SMC was significantly increased in the high dose group, while the apoptotic rate of LPMC in the middle dose group was increased. Compared with SMC, LPMC and PBMC of normal group, the mRNA level of nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kB), transcription factor-activated protein-1 (AP-1) and nuclear factor of activated T cells (NF-AT) were higher in model group. Tetramethylpyrazine inhibited the increase of NF-kB, AP-1 and NF-AT mRNA induced by oxazolone. For SMC, LPMC and PBMC there was significant difference in the mRNA level of AP-1 among the three different doses of tetramethylpyrazine treated groups. However, no significant difference was observed in the mRNA levels of NF-AT and NF-ÎºB between normal and middle groups. Tetramethylpyrazine promoted the apoptotic rate of SMC and LPMC
