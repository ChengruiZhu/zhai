Epigenetic packaging of DNA sequence into chromatin is a major force in shaping the function of complex genomes. Different types of chromatin have distinct effects on gene expression, and thus chromatin state imparts distinct features on the associated genomic DNA. Our study focuses on the transition between two opposing chromatin states: euchromatin, which generally correlates with gene expression, and heterochromatin, which is typically refractive to gene expression. While heterochromatin is capable of spreading into euchromatic domains, the parameters that influence such spreading are unknown. We established heterochromatin at ectopic sites in the genome and evaluated whether specific DNA sequences affected the extent of heterochromatin spreading and the transition between heterochromatin and euchromatin. We found that the nature of the genomic DNA neighboring the heterochromatic sequence dramatically affected the extent of heterochromatin spreading. In particular, the presence of genes antagonized the spread of heterochromatin, whereas neutral sequence elements were incorporated into the domain. This study demonstrates that genome sequence and chromatin identity are inextricably linked; features of both interact to determine the structural and functional fate of underlying DNA sequences.
