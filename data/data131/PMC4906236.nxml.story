The content for the LIN was subdivided into six primary information topics with interview videos featuring rheumatologists, allied health professionals, and persons with SLE. Usability and acceptability of the LIN was tested on 43 females with SLE. Of these, 37 (86%) completed telephone interviews. The average age was 43.6 (SD 15.9) years and disease duration averaged 14.1 (SD 10.8) years. Median time spent on LIN was 16.3 (interquartile range [IQR]:13.7, 53.5) minutes and median number of sessions was 2 (IQR: 1, 3). Overall, Likert ratings (0=strongly disagree; 7=strongly agree) of website usability and content were very high, with 75% scoring >6 out of 7 on all items. All participants agreed that LIN was easy to use, would recommend it to others with SLE, and would refer to it for future questions about SLE. Very high ratings were also given to relevancy, credibility, and usefulness of the information provided. Overall, 73% of the participants rated all topics helpful to very helpful. Participants who reported more prior knowledge about SLE rated items regarding improvement in knowledge and helpfulness relatively lower than persons with less prior knowledge. Most participants commented that the LIN would be very useful to those newly diagnosed with SLE. Minor revisions were recommended.
