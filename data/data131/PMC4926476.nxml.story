Previous studies showed that SDF-1α is a catabolic factor that can infiltrate cartilage, decrease proteoglycan content, and increase MMP-13 activity. Inhibiting the SDF-1α/CXCR4 signalling pathway can attenuate the pathogenesis of osteoarthritis (OA). Recent studies have also shown that SDF-1α enhances chondrocyte proliferation and maturation. These results appear to be contradictory. In the current study, we used a destabilisation OA animal model to investigate the effects of SDF-1α/CXCR4 signalling in the tibial subchondral bone and the OA pathological process. Post-traumatic osteoarthritis (PTOA) mice models were prepared by transecting the anterior cruciate ligament (ACLT), or a sham surgery was performed, in a total of 30 mice. Mice were treated with phosphate buffer saline (PBS) or AMD3100 (an inhibitor of CXCR4) and sacrificed at 30 days post ACLT or sham surgery. Tibial subchondral bone status was quantified by micro-computed tomography (μCT). Knee-joint histology was analysed to examine the articular cartilage and joint degeneration. The levels of SDF-1α and collagen type I c-telopeptidefragments (CTX-I) were quantified by ELISA. Bone marrow mononuclear cells (BMMCs) were used to clarify the effects of SDF-1α on osteoclast formation and activity
