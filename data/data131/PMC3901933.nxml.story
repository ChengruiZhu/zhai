One of an essential characteristic of human skin are time dependent mechanical properties. Here, we demonstrate that stiffness of human dermal fibroblast correlates with age and it can be restored after anti-wrinkle tripeptide treatment. The stiffness of human fibroblasts isolated from donors of 30-, 40- and 60 years old were examined. Additionally the effect of anti- wrinkle tripeptide of latter cells was investigated. The atomic force microscopy measurements were performed on untreated fibroblast as well as on treated with the peptide. The Young’s modulus for two indentation depths 200 and 600 nm of each cell type was determined. The Young’s modulus increases with age of the cells. The highest values of Young’s modulus were obtained for fibroblasts collected from 60 years old donors, for indentation depth of ~200 nm. For larger indentation depth of 600 nm there are no significant differences in stiffness between cells. Fibroblasts treated with the anti-wrinkle tripeptide exhibit lower Young’s modulus. The cells derived from 40- and 60-years old donors restored stiffness characteristic to the level of 30 years old subjects. The results show correlation between stiffness and age of the human fibroblast as well as impact of anti-wrinkle tripeptide on the mechanical properties of skin cells.
