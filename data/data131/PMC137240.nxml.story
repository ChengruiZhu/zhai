Early approaches to the development of oxygen carriers involved the			 use of stroma-free hemoglobin solutions. These solutions did not require blood			 typing or crossmatching and could be stored for long periods. In addition, a			 variety of methods have been developed in chemically modifying and stabilizing			 the hemoglobin molecule. Several hemoglobin therapeutics are now in clinical			 trials as temporary alternatives to blood or as therapeutic agents for			 ischemia. The various hemoglobin products under development are derived from			 three principal sources: human, bovine and genetically engineered hemoglobin.			 Diaspirin cross-linked hemoglobin (DCLHb), administered at doses ranging from			 approximately 20-1000 ml, has been investigated in a number of clinical trials			 in patients undergoing orthopedic, abdominal aortic repair, major abdominal			 surgery, cardiac surgery and in critically ill patients with septic shock. In			 several studies, DCLHb was effective in avoiding the transfusion. However,			 Baxter Healthcare Corporation (Chicago, Illinois, USA) stopped the development			 of DCLHb after two unsuccessful trials in trauma patients. Bovine polymerized			 hemoglobin has also been extensively studied. Several phase II and phase III			 trials have been performed with this product in hemorrhagic surgery, cardiac			 surgery and vascular surgery, but data have not yet been published. Hemoglobin			 therapeutics could provide an important new option as an alternative to blood			 transfusion. Furthermore, they may be able to provide an immediate on-site			 replacement for traumatic blood loss, prevent global ischemia and organ			 failure, treat focal ischemia, and provide effective hemodynamic support for			 septic shock-induced hypotension.
