Job's syndrome also known as hyper-IgE syndrome is a rare disorder associated with immunodeficiency. It includes recurrent abscesses of staphylococcal origin affecting skin and musculoskeletal system, recurring pneumonia and pneumatoceles, eosinophilia, craniofacial, and bone growth changes. This case report describes the disease and anesthetic management. Ten-year-old male child weighing 18 kg was diagnosed recently as Job's syndrome and was posted for abscess drainage over chest, back, upper, and lower limb. He had associated severe mental retardation. The choice of anesthetic technique was based on multiple surgical sites and associated mental retardation. Due to associated mental retardation child was sedated under our vigilance with syrup midazolam 9 mg orally and EMLA cream applied with occlusive dressing 30 min prior to shifting to OT. Upon arrival to the OT, pulse oximetry, noninvasive blood pressure, Electrocardiogram, temperature probe, cardioscope were attached. Inhalation induction done with sevoflurane and IV line secured with 22G cannula. Glycopyrolate 0.1 mg + fentanyl 30 mcg + Propofol 30 mg given intravenously. General anesthesia was maintained with bag and mask ventilation with oxygen + nitrous oxide + sevoflurane with spontaneous ventilation. Postoperative period was uneventful. This case is presented in view of rarity of its occurrence and frequency of repeated surgical intervention and anesthesia. Associated mental retardation in this case could be an isolated incident or could be an occurrence related to underlying disease process itself.
