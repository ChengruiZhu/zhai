The male gamete of the Gregarine Lecudina tuzetae has been studied with transmission electron microscopy and microcinematography. It is characterized by a flagellar axoneme of 6 + 0 pattern, a reduction of the chondriome, and the abundance of storage polysaccharide or lipid bodies. The movements of the flagella are of the undulating type and they are performed in the three dimensions of space. They are very slow, with a cycle time of about 2s. The structure of the axoneme components are similar to those of flagella with a 9 + 2 pattern. Each doublet has overall dimensions of 350 x 220 A; the space between the adjacent doublets is about 160 A. The A subfiber bears arms like dynein arms. The diameter of the axoneme is about 1,000 A. The basal body consists of a cylinder of dense material 2,500 A long and 1,300- 1,400 A in diameter; a microtubule 200 A in diameter is present in the axis. This study shows that a 6 + 0 pattern can generate a flagellar movement. The mechanism of the flagellar movement of the male gamete of L. tuzetae does not require the presence of central microtubules and it would include molecular interactions of the dynein-tubulin type between the adjacent peripheric doublets. The slowness of the movements is discussed in terms of the axoneme's structure and its energy supply. Finally, the phylogenetic significance of this flagella is examined on the basis of the morphopoietic potentialities of the centriolar structures.
