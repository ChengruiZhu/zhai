-butylidenephthalide (BP), are wide-ranging in nature, including impacts on cancer cell apoptosis, cell cycle arrest, and cancer cell senescence. The compound also exhibits a relatively high level of penetration through the blood-brain barrier (BBB). Taken together, its actions have been shown to have anti-proliferative, anti-chemoresistance, anti-invasion, anti-migration, and anti-dissemination effects against GBM. In addition, a local drug delivery system for the subcutaneous and intracranial implantation of BP wafers that significantly reduce tumor size in xenograft models, as well as orthotopic and spontaneous brain tumors in animal models, has been developed. Isochaihulactone (ICL), another kind of plant product, possesses a broad spectrum of pharmacological activities, including impacts on cancer cell apoptosis and cell cycle arrest, as well as anti-proliferative and anti-chemoresistance effects. Furthermore, these actions have been specifically shown to have cancer-fighting effects on GBM. In short, the results of various studies reviewed herein have provided substantial evidence indicating that BP and ICH are promising novel anticancer compounds with good potential for clinical applications.
