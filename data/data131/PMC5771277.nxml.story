The patient, a 40-year-old male, was referred to our clinic with intermittent nausea, vomiting and symptomatic anemia for 4 months. Notable hematological indices were low hemoglobin levels of 9.6 g/dl and hematocrit levels of 35.8%, while after receiving two units of concentrated red blood cells, at discharge; they achieved levels of 15.2 g/dl and 42.3%, respectively. Esophagogastroduodenoscopy revealed a 3 cm antral pedunculated polyp, prolapsing into pylorus thus causing intermittent pyloric obstruction and anemia. Histological examination revealed a hyperplastic polyp without evidences of malignancy. No atrophy, metaplasia, dysplastic changes or Helicobacter pylori infection were detected in samples taken from the antrum and the corpus; however, the examination provided evidence for gastritis. Follow-up endoscopy was provided after 12 weeks to see polypectomy site after a course of Pantoprazole administration, and to define symptom-free time after polypectomy. Endoscopic removal of complicated gastric polyps should be considered at the time of initial diagnostic endoscopy. Endoscopic resection of polyps enables to determine the exact histopathologic type as well as to effectively treat symptomatic gastric outlet obstruction and anemia.
