The distribution of galactosyl transferase was studied using trans and cis Golgi fractions isolated by a modification of the Ehrenreich et al. procedure (1973. J. Cell Biol. 59:45-72) as well as an intact Golgi fraction isolated by a new one-step procedure. Two methods of assay were used. The first method analyzed the ability of Golgi fractions to transfer galactose (from uridine diphosphogalactose [UDP-gal] substrate) to the defined exogenous acceptor ovomucoid. The second method assessed the transfer of galactose from UDP-gal substrate to endogenous acceptors (endogenous glycosylation). The trans Golgi fraction (Golgi light) was highly active by the first method but revealed only low activity by the second method. Golgi fractions enriched in central and cis elements (the Golgi intermediate, heavy and especially the intact Golgi fraction) were highly active in both methods of assay. The endogenous glycosylation approach was validated by gel fluorography of the endogenous acceptors. For all Golgi fractions, transfer of galactose was revealed to secretory glycopeptides. It is concluded that galactosyl transferase activity in vivo occurs primarily in central and cis Golgi elements but not trans Golgi vesicles.
