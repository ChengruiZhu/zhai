At the end of the embryonic period of human development, c-kit immunoreactive (c-kit IR) cells identifiable as interstitial cells of Cajal (ICC) are present in the oesophagus and stomach wall. In the small and large bowel, c-kit-IR cells appear later (in the small bowel at 9 weeks, and in the colon at 10â€“12 weeks), also in the MP region. The object of this study was to determine the timing of appearance and distribution of c-kit IR cells in the human embryonic and foetal duodenum. I used immunohistochemistry to examine the embryonic and foetal duodenum for cells expressing CD117 (Kit), expressed by mature ICC and ICC progenitor cells and CD34 to identify presumed ICC progenitors. Enteric plexuses were examined by way of antineuron-specific enolase and the differentiation of smooth muscle cells was studied using antidesmin antibodies. At the end of the embryonic period of development, c-kit IR cells were solely present in the proximal duodenum in the form of a wide belt of densely packed cells around the inception of the myenteric plexus (MP) ganglia. In the distal duodenum, c-kit IR cells emerged at the beginning of the foetal period in the form of thin rows of pleomorphic cells at the level of the MP. From the beginning of the fourth month, the differences in the distribution of ICC in the different portions of the duodenum were established, and this relationship was still present in later developmental stages. In fact, in the proximal duodenum, ICC of the MP (ICC-MP), ICC of the circular muscle (ICC-CM) and ICC of the septa (ICC-SEP) were present, and in the distal duodenum ICC-MP and ICC-SEP only. In conclusion, in the humans there is a difference in the timing and patterns of development of ICC in the proximal duodenum compared to the distal duodenum.
