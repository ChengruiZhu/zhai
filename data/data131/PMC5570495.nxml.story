Cellular senescence is an irreversible arrest of cell proliferation. Senescence is understood to be a universal barrier that all cancers must overcome during their evolution. Developing ways to induce senescence in cancer cells is therefore an attractive strategy to identify targets for cancer therapy. However, a lack of understanding of this complex process has meant that little progress has been made in translating senescence induction into the clinic. Here we describe the identification and validation of a panel of inducers of senescence phenotypes from a large-scale siRNA screen. We show that the senescence response can be induced to varying degrees in genetic backgrounds mimicking common cancer mutations, allowing for a prioritisation of approaches. We also show that partial senescence responses can be triggered in cancer cells in the absence of genes considered by some to be essential for a senescence response. However, distinct differences in proliferation arrest are observed different backgrounds. These results advance our understanding of the complexity of senescence biology. This study has identified several potential targets for drug discovery. Interestingly, our results show the potential for therapeutic intervention in some backgrounds which are so far refractory to current treatments.
