Most species go extinct because humans have cleared their habitat. Habitat loss can also cause people to lose some of the services provided by ecosystems, such as the removal of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere or the protection of coastal communities from storm damage. There are two broad strategies for stopping and reversing habitat loss: we can either protect habitat that is currently intact, or we can restore habitat that has already been cleared. Superficially, we might imagine that, as with human health, “prevention is better than cure,” and that therefore habitat protection should be given priority over habitat restoration. However, there is currently no scientific theory to justify this belief. Here, we used an ecosystem model and dynamic optimization tools from mathematics to show that habitat restoration (such as tree planting) can, surprisingly, be more cost-effective than habitat protection (such as designating a national park) for two case studies. We discovered that the best decision depends on the relative costs of the two actions, the rate at which habitat is being lost, and the time lag between restored habitat being as useful as intact habitat for securing species and ecosystem services.
