A method to investigate light and radiation field congruence utilizing a commercially available amorphous silicon electronic portal imaging device (EPID) was developed. This method employed an EPID, the associated EPI software, and a diamond‐shaped template. The template was constructed from a block tray in which Sn/Pb wires, 1 mm in diameter, were embedded into a diamond shaped groove milled into the tray. The collimator jaws of the linac were aligned such that the light field fell directly on the corners of the diamond. A radiation detection algorithm within the EPI software determined the extent of the radiation field. The light and radiation field congruence was evaluated by comparing the vertexes of the diamond reference structure to the detected radiation field. In addition, the digital jaw settings were recorded and later compared to the light field detected on the films and EPIs. Three linear accelerators were tracked for a period ranging from 2–8 months. Light radiation field congruence tests with films and EPIs were comparable, yielding a difference of less than 0.6 mm, well within the allowed 2‐mm tolerance. A disparity was observed in the magnitude of the detected light field. The
