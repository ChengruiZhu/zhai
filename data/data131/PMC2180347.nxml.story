 The effect of alcohol ingestion upon the development of naturally occurring and stilbestrol-induced arteriosclerosis was studied in the domestic fowl. In two experiments, a 15 per cent ethyl alcohol solution was used for drinking purposes, and in a third experiment wine containing 12 per cent of it was administered. The caloric intake of both food and alcohol was carefully controlled by pair-feeding, a glucose solution being used for drinking purposes to equalize the caloric intakes of the control birds with those of the alcohol-treated birds. A total of 224 cockrels was studied, and the period of observation for each experiment lasted 12 months. The degree of arteriosclerosis in the thoracic and abdominal aortas was determined in the gross and microscopically, and the degree of lipide infiltration was determined microscopically. The gross grading of arteriosclerotic lesions agreed closely with the microscopic analysis of intimal thickening and lipide infiltration of the arterial wall. The gross gradings were subjected to a critical statistical analysis which allowed precise statements to be made on the probability that a real effect would be overlooked. This analysis yielded no evidence that alcohol or the wine used had affected the degree of gross arteriosclerosis or lipide infiltration.
