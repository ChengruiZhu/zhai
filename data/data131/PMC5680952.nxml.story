Adipose-derived stem cells (ASCs) can be applied extensively in the clinic because they can be easily isolated and cause less donor-site morbidity; however, their application can be complicated by patient-specific factors, such as age and harvest site. In this study, we systematically evaluated the effects of age on the quantity and quality of human adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells (hASCs) isolated from excised chest subcutaneous adipose tissue and investigated the underlying molecular mechanism. hASCs were isolated from donors of 3 different age-groups (i.e., child, young adult, and elderly). hASCs are available from individuals across all age-groups and maintain mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) characteristics. However, the increased age of the donors was found to have a significant negative effect on hASCs frequency base on colony-forming unit fibroblasts assay. Moreover, there is a decline in both stromal vascular fraction (SVF) cell yield and the proliferation rate of hASCs with increasing age, although this relationship is not significant. Aging increases cellular senescence, which is manifested as an increase in SA-Î²-gal-positive cells, increased mitochondrial-specific reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, and the expression of
