Genetic restrictions governing the induction and expression of suppressor T cells (Ts) in tolerance to 1-fluoro-2,4-dinitrogenzene (DNFB) contract sensitivity were studied. Tolerance was induced by using 2,4-dinitrophenyl (DNP)-modified lymphoid cells (DNP-LC) as tolerogen. Two kinds of Ts were found-those produced by DNP-LC syngeneic to the donor of the Ts (syninduced Ts), and those produced by DNP-LC allogeneic to the donor of Ts (alloinduced Ts). Studies employing congenic resistant mouse strains indicated that recognition of DNP-modified-major histocompatibility region determinants on the tolerogenic DNP-LC was essential for the induction of both types of Ts. Non-H-2 genetic background was irrelevant to Ts induction. Mapping studies indicated that induction of both syninduced and alloinduced Ts was associated with recognition of DNP-modified-MHC region determinants which map to the right of the H-2G region (i.e., H-2D gene products). Tolerization of donor mice with DNP-LC which were H-2D region compatible, but not with H-2K or I region compatible DNP-LC, was both sufficient and required for the induction of hapten-specific syninduced Ts. Tolerization of donor mice with DNP-LC which were incompatible only at the H-2D region was sufficient for the induction of alloinduced Ts. These Ts were capable of suppressing recipient mice only if the recipients shared the H-2D region with the strain providing the DNP-LC tolerogen, and were not capable of suppressing recipients sharing all but the H-2D region with the tolerogen.
