The cytochrome P450 1B1 (CYP1B1) is a heme-thiolate monooxygenase involved in both estrogen biosynthesis and metabolism. For instance, CYP1B1 catalyzes the hydroxylation of E2 leading to the production of 4-hydroxyestradiol that may act as a potent carcinogenic agent. In addition, CYP1B1 is overexpressed in different tumors including breast cancer. In this scenario, it is worth mentioning that CYP1B1 expression is triggered by estrogens through the estrogen receptor (ER)Î± in breast cancer cells. In the present study, we evaluated whether the G protein estrogen receptor namely GPER may provide an alternate route toward the expression and function of CYP1B1 in ER-negative breast cancer cells, in main players of the tumor microenvironment as cancer associated fibroblasts (CAFs) that were obtained from breast cancer patients, in CAFs derived from a cutaneous metastasis of an invasive mammary ductal carcinoma and in breast tumor xenografts. Our results show that GPER along with the EGFR/ERK/c-Fos transduction pathway can lead to CYP1B1 regulation through the involvement of a half-ERE sequence located within the CYP1B1 promoter region. As a biological counterpart, we found that both GPER and CYP1B1 mediate growth effects
