Inside the nucleus of a cell, DNA is associated with proteins to form a complex three-dimensional structure referred to as chromatin. The structure of chromatin influences how accessible specific DNA sequences are to transcription factors, and therefore chromatin accessibility is an important determinant of gene expression. To better understand how patterns of chromatin accessibility change over time, we quantitatively measured levels of chromatin accessibility in two yeast species and their diploid hybrid. We show that significant differences in chromatin accessibility exist between these two species and occur upstream of genes that are enriched for specific biological functions. We also develop new statistical methods to understand the genetics of variation in chromatin accessibility. Finally, we show that the relationship between chromatin accessibility and gene expression is complex, and many of the observed differences in chromatin accessibility between these two species may not influence gene expression levels. Thus, our work highlights the need to develop additional experimental and statistical methods to distinguish between functionally significant and benign changes in chromatin accessibility.
