Computational biology research is frequently conducted by virtual teams: groups of scientists in different locations that use shared resources and online communication tools to collaborate on a problem. It is imperative that the next generation of computational biologists can easily work in these interdisciplinary, distributed settings. However, most undergraduate research training programs are hosted by a single institution. In this report, we describe a new summer undergraduate research program in which students conduct biomolecular modeling research with the Rosetta software in research groups around the world. The students each conducted their own research project in a university-based group while collaborating with other students and members of the Rosetta Commons at a distance using everyday tools such as Slack, Skype, GitHub, and Google Hangouts. When compared with in-person summer research training programs, students report similar or even improved outcomes, including the development of a sense of community and increases in their scientific self-efficacy, scientific identity, and science values. Furthermore, our program attracts a diverse group of students and thus has the potential to help broaden participation in computational biology.
