 sensitive cells growing in 5 per cent peptone at different stages of growth. (1) Growth rate of infected and uninfected cells; (2) RNA, DNA, and protein content; (3) volume of the cell; (4) phage yield per cell by plaque count; (5) phage yield per cell by cell and plaque count; (6) lysis time. The growth rate decreases as the cell concentration increases. The lysis time and the protein N per cell are nearly independent of the growth rate; all the other values increase as the growth rate increases. The ratio See PDF for Equation is nearly constant. RNA and DNA per cell increase less rapidly than the volume, so that NA per unit volume is not constant, but decreases as the size of the cell increases. The phage yield measured under conditions in which the infected cells do not grow (by plaque count) is very nearly proportional to the size of the cell. The phage yield per cell, under conditions in which the infected cells do grow, increases more rapidly than the size of the cells. The phage yield per cell under these conditions may be calculated by the equation See PDF for Equation The determining factor for the variation in phage yield is the growth rate of the cells. This, in turn, is determined by the composition of the medium. III. The growth and phage production of
