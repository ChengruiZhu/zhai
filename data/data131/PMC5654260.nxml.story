There are many hematological disorders in the human circulation involving significant alteration of the shape and size of red blood cells (RBCs), e.g. sickle cell disease (SCD), spherocytosis, diabetes, HIV, etc. These morphological alterations reflect subtle multiscale processes taking place at the protein level and affecting the cell shape, its size, and rigidity. In SCD, in particular, there are multiple shape types in addition to the sickle shape, directly related to the sickle hemoglobin polymerization inside the RBC, which is induced by hypoxic conditions, e.g., in the post-capillary regions, in the spleen, etc. Moreover, the induced stiffness of RBCs depends on the de-oxygenation level encountered in hypoxic environments. Here, we develop a new computational framework based on deep convolutional networks in order to classify efficiently the heterogeneous shapes encountered in the sickle blood, and we complement our method with an independent shape factor analysis. This dual approach provides robust predictions and can be potentially used to assess the severity of SCD. The method is general and can be adapted to other hematological disorders as well as to screen diseased cells from healthy ones for different diseases.
