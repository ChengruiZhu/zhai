Gastric cancer (GC) is among the most frequent types of cancer worldwide. Therefore, understanding the biology of GC tumorigenesis is important for appropriate diagnosis and patient surveillance. The miR-191/425 cluster has been reported to be overexpressed in various human cancers, but the tumorigenic role and clinical significance of miR-191/425 overexpression in gastric carcinogenesis is currently undefined. In this study, the expression of miR-191 and miR-425 in GC tissue and serum was assessed, and the relationship between miRNA expression and clinicopathological data was analyzed. We found that miR-191 and miR-425 were both significantly increased in human GC tissues relative to adjacent normal controls. In addition, miR-191 levels correlated with GC tumor stage and metastatic state. Furthermore, the level of serum miR-191 was significantly higher in the GC group than in the control group when using serum miR-16 as an endogenous control. Finally, inhibition of miR-191 or miR-425 in the GC cell lines HGC-27 not only reduced cell proliferation and cell cycle progression but also impaired cell migration and invasion. Taken together, our results revealed the oncogenic roles of miR-191 and miR-425 in gastric carcinogenesis, and indicated the potential use of serum miR-191 as a novel and stable biomarker for GC diagnosis.
