Protein synthesis is a fundamental mechanism capturing the rejuvenation of DNA–encoded genetic information by its translation into molecular effectors—proteins. Its regulation can be used to change the protein content and thus to adapt a cell to changing environmental conditions. Translation requires mRNAs delivering genetic information of corresponding genes, tRNAs carrying amino-acids, ribosomes as the molecular translators, and accessory proteins/factors facilitating the entire process. There are numerous regulatory mechanisms that modulate translation at its various stages. Here we describe one such a translational control mechanism called reinitiation. Most eukaryotic mRNAs contain only a single translatable gene (ORF); however, in many of them this gene is preceded by a short coding sequence (uORF) that is in some cases translated first. In order to reinitiate translation on the downstream main ORF, a ribosome has to stay bound to mRNA after it has terminated short uORF translation. This requires a concerted action of specific mRNA elements surrounding the uORF and selected initiation factors. Our results delineate how these key players interact with each other and suggest a sequence of general events that ought to take place on short uORF to enable the ribosome to reach and translate the main ORF downstream.
