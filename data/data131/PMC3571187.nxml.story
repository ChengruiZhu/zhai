The presenters have been involved with telemonitoring deployments utilising a range of different service models. The presentation will describe this spectrum of models, ranging from ‘closed-loop’ systems where triage and response is largely automated, through to centralised telemonitoring teams providing expert clinical triage. Each model has its own strengths and weaknesses. For example, automated systems will reduce costs, but may lessen the ‘human’ elements of care often valued by patients. Conversely, a centralised team of nurses offering clinical triage and response is likely to give added value to a telemonitoring service, but at the cost of substantial financial outlay. Many models of delivery sit within these polar opposites, and the relative strengths and weaknesses of key examples will be discussed. In addition to a theoretical overview, the presentation will also allow for the discussion of real-world experiences of developing and operationalizing different models of triage and response. Examples from Yorkshire and the Humber will be discussed, and delegates will be asked to share their own experiences and perspectives. A specific example from a GP practice in Yorkshire will also highlight how models of triage and response can be tailored to dovetail with existing processes.
