Heritability of a trait refers to the proportion of phenotypic variation that is due to genetic variation among individuals. It provides important information about the genetic basis of complex traits and indicates whether a phenotype is an appropriate target for more specific statistical and molecular genetic analyses. Recent studies have leveraged the increasingly ubiquitous genome-wide data and documented the heritability attributable to common genetic variation captured by genotyping microarrays for a wide range of human traits. However, heritability is not a fixed property of a phenotype and can vary with population-specific differences in the genetic background and environmental variation. Here, using a computationally and memory efficient heritability estimation method, we report the heritability for a large number of traits derived from the large-scale, population-based UK Biobank, and, for the first time, demonstrate the moderating effect of three major demographic variables (age, sex and socioeconomic status) on heritability estimates derived from genome-wide common genetic variation. Our study represents the first comprehensive heritability analysis across the phenotypic spectrum in the UK Biobank.
