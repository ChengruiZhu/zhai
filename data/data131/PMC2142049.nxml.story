 1. Experiments were carried out to decide whether a homogeneous phase (solubility) theory or a micellar-structural theory more adequately describes the behavior of dried collodion membranes with solutions of strong electrolytes. 2. A number of dried collodion membranes were prepared from an electrochemically inactive collodion preparation (state I); the characteristic concentration potentials across them were low, about 30 mv. The membranes were activated by oxidation (state II) to give maximum or nearly maximum concentration potentials (about 50 mv.). The oxidized membranes are dried, dissolved in alcohol-ether, and a new set of dry collodion membranes prepared from this solution (state III). The concentration potentials across these membranes are low. 3. Since the properties of a homogeneous phase should not be influenced by a rearrangement of its constituent particles, the experimental results do not support a homogeneous phase (solubility) theory, but they agree with the predictions of the micellar-structural theory. The characteristic behavior of dried collodion membranes in solutions of strong inorganic electrolytes is therefore due to the micellar character of its interstices.
