Association between CYP17 T-34C (rs743572) polymorphism and breast cancer (BC) risk was controversial. In order to derive a more definitive conclusion, we performed this meta-analysis. We searched in the databases of PubMed, EMBASE and Cochrane for eligible publications. Pooled odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) were used to assess the strength of association between CYP17 T-34C polymorphism and breast cancer risk. Forty-nine studies involving 2,7104 cases and 3,4218 control subjects were included in this meta-analysis. In overall, no significant association between CYP17 T-34C polymorphism and breast cancer susceptibility was found among general populations. In the stratified analysis by ethnicity and source, significant associations were still not detected in all genetic models; besides, limiting the analysis to studies with controls in agreement with HWE, we also observed no association between CYP17 T-34C polymorphism and breast cancer risk. For premenopausal women, we didn't detect an association between rs743572 and breast cancer risk; however, among postmenopausal women, we observed that the association was statistically significant under the allele contrast genetic model (OR = 1.10, 95% CI = 1.03â€“1.17,
