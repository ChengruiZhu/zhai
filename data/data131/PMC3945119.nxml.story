Proteins are fundamental building blocks of cells. They perform a variety of biological functions, many of which are essential to the vitality and normal functioning of cells. Proteins have to be located at the appropriate regions inside a cell to perform their functions. Therefore, when proteins change their locations, they may acquire new or different functions. However, the relationships between the locations and functions of proteins are difficult to analyze because protein locations are often represented in distinct and manually-defined categories of subcellular regions. Many proteins have complex or subtle differences in their localization patterns that can be hardly represented by these categories. Here, we present an automated analysis tool for generating quantitative signatures of protein localization patterns without requiring manual or automated assignments of proteins into distinct categories. We show that our tool can identify proteins located at the same subcellular regions more accurately than existing categorization-based methods. Our tool allows comprehensive and more accurate studies of the relationships between protein localizations and functions. By knowing where proteins are located and how their locations were changed, we may discover their functions and better understand how they acquire these functions.
