A 29-year-old Hispanic male, with a history of hyperthyroidism, presented to the emergency department with progressive weakness, predominantly in the lower extremities since morning. Earlier that day, the patient was seen in the same emergency department for difficulty in swallowing. He was diagnosed with uvulitis and received intramuscular dexamethasone and was discharged with amoxicillin for ten days. At home, he started to develop cramps in his lower extremities associated with paresthesias, which progressed to severe weakness to the point where he could not get out of bed. He returned to the hospital and revealed that he had suffered a similar episode following a steroid injection five years ago. He had not sought medical attention as it resolved spontaneously. He denied strenuous exercise, carbohydrate-rich meal, or alcohol ingestion. The patient had been noncompliant with atenolol and methimazole for the past month after losing his medical insurance. On examination, the patient appeared alert and calm. His vitals were significant for tachycardia of 123 beats per minute. Thyromegaly and tenderness were absent on examination of the neck. Muscle strength was 5/5 in the ankle dorsiflexors and ankle plantar flexors bilaterally, but the strength of the iliopsoas, quadriceps, and hamstrings was only 2/5 bilaterally. Deep tendon reflexes were diminished throughout to 1+. Laboratory findings were significant for profound hypokalemia, hypophosphatemia, low thyroid stimulating hormone, and elevated free T3 and T4 levels suggestive of hyperthyroidism. His electrolytes were replaced aggressively and his home medications were restarted. His electrolyte imbalance corrected and his symptoms resolved within a day and he was discharged home.
