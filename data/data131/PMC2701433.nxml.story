A total of 513 patients were recruited across 38 sites. The mean ± standard deviation (SD) age at first depressive episode was 38.7 ± 15.9 years, the mean duration of depression 10.6 ± 12.3 years. The most common psychiatric comorbidities in the previous 24 months were anxiety/panic (72.6%) and obsessive/compulsive disorders (13.4%), while 35.9% had functional somatic syndromes. Most patients (65.1%) reported pain from any cause. Monotherapy with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) was prescribed at enrolment in 64.5% and 6.4% of the cases, respectively. The most commonly prescribed agents were sertraline (17.3%), escitalopram (16.2%), venlaflaxine (15.6%) and paroxetine (14.8%). The mean HADS subscores for depression and anxiety were 13.3 ± 4.2 and 12.2 ± 3.9, respectively; 76.4% of patients could be defined as being 'probable cases' for depression and 66.2% for anxiety. The mean total score of VAS-pain in the last week was 42.9 ± 27.1, with highest scores reported in the 'interference of pain with daily activities' and in 'amount of time patient was awake and had pain'. From SF-36, the worst health status was found for role limitations due to emotional problem, mental health and social functioning. A mean score < 50 (that is, below the standardised population norm) was also found in all remaining domains. The SF-36 summary scores and EQ-5D (health status and VAS) were lower in patients with moderate/severe pain than in those with no or mild pain.
