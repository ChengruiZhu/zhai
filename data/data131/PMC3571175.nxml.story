Regarding the overall Help4Mood system, participants raised three main issues, integration with treatment; configurability to support local best practice; and affordability for health services. Monitoring was discussed in terms of complexity, privacy in shared spaces, and crisis. Clinicians proposed physiological, mood, and neuropsychomotor variables that might be monitored, which would yield a complex picture of the patient’s state. Obtrusiveness (of monitors) and intrusiveness (to routines and environment) were raised as important barriers. Patients felt that Help4Mood should provide them with tailored resources in a crisis; clinicians were clear that Help4Mood should not be used to detect acute suicide risks. Three main design characteristics emerged for the Virtual Agent—ease of use, interaction style, and humanoid appearance. The agent should always react appropriately, look and behave like a good therapist, and show positive or neutral emotion. Core functions of the decision support system were characterized by the themes adaptation, informing treatment, and supporting clinician-patient interaction. The decision support system should adapt the patient’s session with the Virtual Agent in accordance with the patient’s mood and stamina. Monitoring data should be presented as a one-page summary highlighting key trends to be discussed with the patient during a consultation.
