The present study is aimed at the overall improvement in the efficacy, reduced toxicity and enhancement of therapeutic index of cisplatin. Nanocapsules of cisplatin containing ethylcellulose have been prepared using solvent evaporation technique under ambient conditions. The prepared nanocapsules were used for controlled drug release of anticancer agents with gold and iron oxide nanoparticles. The drug-entrapped nanocapsules were characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) studies indicated the absence of chemical interactions between the drug, polymer and metal nanoparticles. The drug loaded nanoparticles are spherical in shape and had average diameter in the range of 100-300 nm. Drug release study showed that the acidic media provided a faster release than the phosphate buffer media. These findings were also compared statistically through calculating mean, standard deviation and coefficient of variation for various polymer nanocapsules. However, the drug release for gold nanoparticles/anticancer drug (Au-cis) incorporated ethylcellulose nanocapsules was controlled and slow compared to iron oxide nanoparticles-cisplatin incorporated ethylcellulose nanocapsules. Hence, gold nanoparticles act as good trapping agents which slow down the rate of drug release from nanocapsules.
