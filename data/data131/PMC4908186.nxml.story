Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) have been proved to play important roles in the tumorigenesis and development of several human malignancies. Our study aims to investigate the expression and function of lncRNA-UCA1 in osteosarcoma. lncRNA-UCA1 expression was detected in osteosarcoma tissues and cell lines by using qRT-PCR. Association between lncRNA-UCA1 levels and clinicopathological factors and patient's prognosis was analyzed. The roles of lncRNA-UCA1 in regulating osteosarcoma cell proliferation, apoptosis, migration, and invasion were evaluated in vitro. We found that lncRNA-UCA1 expression was upregulated in osteosarcoma tissues and cell lines. High lncRNA-UCA1 expression was significantly correlated with large tumor size, high tumor grade, positive distant metastasis, and advanced clinical stage. Multivariate regression analysis identified lncRNA-UCA1 overexpression as an independent unfavorable prognostic factor. lncRNA-UCA1 knockdown inhibited osteosarcoma cell proliferation, promoted cell apoptosis, and suppressed cell invasion and migration, whereas lncRNA-UCA1 overexpression showed opposite effects. These findings suggested that lncRNA-UCA1 may contribute to osteosarcoma initiation and progression, and would be not only a novel prognostic marker but also a potential therapeutic target for this disease.
