The purpose of this study is developing and applying psychological skill training (PST) program as one of the methods of intervention for psychological rehabilitation in order for a successful recovery of the professional soccer player (K). He is currently on rehabilitation training after an injury, and we tried to see the results of this program. It was designed as a program of 17 sessions including 3 interviews and diagnostic checks (psychological skill questionnaire: PSQ, profiles of mood states: POMS) and 14 sessions of PST (goal setting, anxiety reduction, concentration, confidence). After the application of the program, the levels of anxiety reduction, goal setting, concentration, and confidence were visibly increased, and in POMS, which is an indicator of physical rehabilitation process of K, vigor was increased. Meanwhile negative emotions, such as tension, depression, and fatigue were decreased. This program was developed for K, and therefore it has some difficulties in applying it to other players. However, the significance of this study is that it could serve as a basis on developing programs for other players in the rehabilitation process. In addition, it has also proven that PST can be used as a successful method for psychological rehabilitation intervention.
