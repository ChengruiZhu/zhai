, the central molecular clock is regulated by transcriptional and translational feedback loops that drive rhythmic waves of gene expression. Additionally, the clock is controlled by post-translational modifications, including phosphorylation of a core negative regulator, PERIOD (PER). Using a proteomic approach, we identified two key phosphorylation sites within PER that cooperate to establish proper daily rhythms. Mutation of both residues results in a period of âˆ¼30 hrs, whereas single mutant phenotypes are less severe suggesting these sites normally cooperate to control the pace of the clock. Biochemical and immunohistochemical data demonstrate that altered PER phosphorylation and changes in protein stability give rise to behavioral defects. Other mutations in the vicinity of the two sites above also alter circadian period, thereby confirming a new regulatory domain of PER. Our results also suggest that the phospho-residues identified in this study regulate phosphorylation in another important domain of PER. Together our data establish that cooperativity between neighboring phospho-sites as well as interactions between different phosphorylated domains of PER control its stability and overall circadian periodicity.
