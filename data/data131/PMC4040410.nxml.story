Protein glycosylation, as an important post-translational modification, is implicated in a number of ailments. Applying proteomic approaches, including mass spectrometry (MS) analyses that have played a significant role in biomarker detection and early diagnosis of diseases, to the study of glycoproteins or glycopeptides will facilitate a deeper understanding of many physiological functions and biological pathways involved in cancer, inflammatory and degenerative diseases. The abundance of glycopeptides and their ionization potential are relatively lower compared to those of non-glycopeptides; therefore, sample enrichment is necessary for glycopeptides prior to MS analysis. The application of nanotechnology in the past decade has been rapidly penetrating into many diverse scientific research disciplines. Particularly in what we now refer to as the “glycoproteomics area”, nanotechnologies have enabled enhanced sensitivity and specificity of glycopeptide detection in complex biological fluids, which are critical for disease diagnosis and monitoring. In this review, we highlight some recent studies that combine the capabilities of specific nanotechnologies with the comprehensive features of glycoproteomics. In particular, we focus on the ways in which nanotechnology has facilitated the detection of glycopeptides in complex biological samples and enhanced their characterization by MS, in terms of intensity and resolution. These studies reveal an increasingly important role for nanotechnology in helping to overcome certain technical challenges in biomarker discovery, in general, and glycoproteomics research, in particular.
