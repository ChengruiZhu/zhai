This report proposes a concept for the standardization of immunohistochemical evaluation. Immunohistochemical staining has several problems associated with the sensitivity of the technical process and standardization of the assessment of potent staining. We provided data focusing on this concept through immunostaining for CD154 in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). We used two types of anti-CD154 antibody as primary antibodies in immunohistochemical staining, as previously reported. Western blot analysis confirmed strong CD154 expression in the cultured cell line PC10, but not in LK2. We also assessed CD154 expression in SCID mouse xenografts of these cell lines. SCID xenograft data on western blot analysis were consistent with those of cultured cell lines. These xenografts could thus be used as positive or negative tissue controls for CD154 immunostaining. Primary antibodies should therefore be confirmed as recognizing target lesions, while control tissue specimens should be objectively confirmed as having target products using another experimental method. Our method would allow results to be unified at more than one laboratory and could act as an objective control assessment method in immunohistochemistry.
