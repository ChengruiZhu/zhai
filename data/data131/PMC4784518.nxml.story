Increasingly, the potential for school mental health programming to enhance the well-being of children and youth is being recognized and realized. When evidence-based practices in mental health promotion and prevention are adopted in a whole school manner, students show positive social emotional and academic benefits. These findings have stimulated a proliferation of mental well-being programming for Canadian schools, with variability across offerings in terms of supporting evidence, costs and ease of implementation. In the absence of coordination and guidance, there has been uneven uptake of high-quality programming, resulting in a patchwork of sometimes competing efforts across our country. In order to build cohesive and sustainable evidence-based programming, intentional, explicit and systematic effort must be afforded to matters of implementation and scale-up. In Canada, School Mental Health ASSIST has been developed to provide leadership, implementation support and embeddable resources to the province of Ontarioâ€™s 72 school districts, and 5000 schools, with a view to ensuring long-term sustainability of best-in-class school mental health practices. Key elements for uptake and scale-up are described, with an implementation science lens and an emphasis on aspects that are generalizable across jurisdictions.
