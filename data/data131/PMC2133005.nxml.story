 muscle cells was initiated immediately upon the presentation of growth factor–coated beads that induce both AChR cluster formation and dispersal. Whereas the density of AChRs decreased with time, the fine structure of the hot spot remained relatively constant. Although AChR, rapsyn, and phosphotyrosine disappeared, a large part of the original hot spot–associated cytoskeleton remained. This suggests that the dispersal involves the removal of a key linkage between the receptor and its cytoskeletal infrastructure. The rate of hot spot dispersal is inversely related to its distance from the site of synaptic stimulation, implicating the diffusible nature of the signal. PTPase inhibitors, such as pervanadate or phenylarsine oxide, inhibited hot spot dispersal. In addition, they also affected the formation of new clusters in such a way that AChR microclusters extended beyond the boundary set by the clustering stimuli. Furthermore, by introducing a constitutively active PTPase into cultured muscle cells, hot spots were dispersed in a stimulus- independent fashion. This effect of exogenous PTPase was also blocked by pervanadate. These results implicate a role of PTPase in AChR cluster dispersal and formation. In addition to RTK activation, synaptic stimulation may also activate PTPase which acts globally to destabilize preexisting AChR hot spots and locally to facilitate AChR clustering in a spatially discrete manner by countering the action of RTKs.
