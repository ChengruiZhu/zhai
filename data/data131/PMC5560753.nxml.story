In clinical practice, the organ in which a cancer arises typically classifies it. However, developments in our understanding of cancer have revealed that this method overlooks key aspects of cancer biology relevant to both disease prevention and treatment. In fact, work characterizing the genetic make-up of cancers arising in a single organ has revealed that a shared organ of origin does not necessarily imply biological similarity (i.e. not all lung cancers share similar biological and molecular properties). While this approach, known as “within-a-tissue subtyping,” identifies key differences between cancers that arise in a single organ, a broader perspective may highlight important biological similarities between cancers across organs. Here we utilize this second approach, or “across-tissue subtyping,” to gain insight into similarities between cancers (of different organs) that share the same histology—or appear similarly under a microscope. Using publicly available data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), we compare gene expression of two major classes of solid tumors—adenocarcinomas (which arise from cells that form glands) and squamous cell carcinomas (which arise from flattened cells that form physical barriers). We identify several genes and biological pathways that may be common to adenocarcinomas and serve as targets for highly versatile therapies.
