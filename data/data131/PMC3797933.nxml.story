Colonic perforation occurs in a variety of clinical scenarios and colonoscopy-associated perforation is one of the important reasons for colonic perforation. Colonoscopy-associated perforation may be diagnosed during colonoscopy procedure by the visualization of evident colonic wall defect or, after the completion of colonoscopy, by the visualization of leaked air in the peritoneal or retroperitoneal space. Recently, the incidence of colonoscopy-associated perforation increased because of the introduction of colorectal endoscopic submucosal dissection. Traditionally, colonoscopy-associated perforation was managed surgically. However, medical management has been introduced widely and endoscopic clipping is the most important component for the medical management of colonoscopy-associated perforation. Timely administration of antibiotics is also important. Large perforations, diagnostic colonoscopy-associated perforations, large amount of pneumoperitoneum, and severe abdominal pain have been reported to be predictive of the necessity of surgery after endoscopic clipping. Surgery should be performed if patients show clinical deterioration even after the initiation of medical management.
