This study is to explore the effect of valsartan-eluting stents on neointima formation after stenting and to elucidate possible mechanisms how locally used valsartan prevents in-stent restenosis (ISR). METHOD: valsartan- and carriereluting stents were manufactured by using multi-layer-coated technology. Bare stents, carrier-eluting stents and valsartan– eluting stents were implanted into the abdominal aortas of the rabbits respectively. Quantitative angiography (QA) before, immediately after and 3 months after stent implantation were compared between the groups of bare (n=8), carrier-eluting (n=8) and valsartan-eluting stent (n=10), which allows the comparison of vascular diameters of aortas as well as indices of vascular neointimal formation, i.e. luminal area (LA), neointimal area (NIA), inner elastic membrane luminal area (IELA) and the maximal inner-membrane thickness (MIT) in 15 rabbits. α-Actin protein expression were detected by Envision two-step immunohistochemistry. Mean positive indices (MPI) of the above protein were analyzed semi-quantatively by IMS(Information Management System) cell image analysis system. MPI=positive area×OD (optical density). Collagen deposition in neointima was observed through MASSON stain among the three groups.
