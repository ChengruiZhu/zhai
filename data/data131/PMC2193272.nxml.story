Cross-linking of FcεRI induces the activation of three protein tyrosine kinases, Lyn, Syk, and Bruton's tyrosine kinase (Btk), leading to the secretion of a panel of proinflammatory mediators from mast cells. This study showed phosphorylation at Ser-473 and enzymatic activation of Akt/protein kinase B, the crucial survival kinase, upon FcεRI stimulation in mouse mast cells. Phosphorylation of Akt is regulated positively by Btk and Syk and negatively by Lyn. Akt in turn can regulate positively the transcriptional activity of interleukin (IL)-2 and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α promoters. Transcription from the nuclear factor κB (NF-κB), nuclear factor of activated T cells (NF-AT), and activator protein 1 (AP-1) sites within these promoters is under the control of Akt activity. Accordingly, the signaling pathway involving IκB-α, a cytoplasmic protein that binds NF-κB and inhibits its nuclear translocation, appears to be regulated by Akt in mast cells. Catalytic activity of glycogen synthase kinase (GSK)-3β, a serine/threonine kinase that phosphorylates NF-AT and promotes its nuclear export, seems to be inhibited by Akt. Importantly, Akt regulates the production and secretion of IL-2 and TNF-α in FcεRI-stimulated mast cells. Altogether, these results revealed a novel function of Akt in transcriptional activation of cytokine genes via NF-κB, NF-AT, and AP-1 that contributes to the production of cytokines.
