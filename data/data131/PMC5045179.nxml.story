Feeding and sleep are fundamental behaviours that are controlled by diverse neuropeptides. While feeding is associated with wake periods, sleep prevents feeding. Both feeding and sleep are timed to specific parts of the day by internal clocks, presumably to optimise behaviour and metabolic processes. We investigated the functions of Allatostatin A (AstA) peptides in the fruit fly. AstA is produced by neurons as well as by endocrine cells in the midgut epithelium. Thermogenetic activation of subsets of AstA-producing cells in the brain and midgut revealed that AstA affects both feeding and sleep in opposite directions: feeding is reduced by AstA signalling, while sleep is promoted. Others could previously show that insect AstA also inhibits gut motility and release of digestive enzymes from the gut. An attractive conclusion is that AstA signalling helps to put flies in a digestive energy-saving state. Interestingly, a set of six AstA-expressing PLP neurons are in close contact to neurons central to the circadian clock network, and express functional receptors for the clock output signal PDF. This opens the possibility that PLP neurons are at the interface between clock, feeding and sleepâ€”a hypothesis that needs to be tested in the future.
