Oligodendrocytes are the myelinating cells of the central nervous system. Together with astrocytes, oligodendrocytes form networks of coupled glial cells—so-called panglial networks—which are built by gap junctions, i.e. intercellular channels composed of connexin proteins. Pelizaeus-Merzbacher–like disease is an inherited early onset myelin disorder of the central nervous system. Certain mutations of the connexin47 gene, which is expressed by oligodendrocytes, cause this disease. Although the course of the human disease is conspicuous and progressive, connexin47 null mice do not show obvious phenotypic alterations suggesting that the disease may be caused by gain of detrimental function due to the connexin47 mutations. Here we introduced a missense mutation that was found in Pelizaeus-Merzbacher–like disease patients into the connexin47 mouse gene. Expression of the mutant connexin47 gene in oligodendrocytes resulted in myelin malformations in young mice but to a relatively mild extent. From a comparison of connexin47 null and connexin47 mutant mice, we conclude that the human Pelizaeus-Merzbacher–like disease is caused by loss of gap junctional coupling, which results in a decreased number of cells coupled within glial networks, and not by a gain of detrimental function of the mutated protein.
