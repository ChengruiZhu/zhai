Most of the patients with lung cancer are diagnosed at advanced stage, and they often lose the opportunity of surgical therapy, most of whom fail to reach good prognosis after chemotherapy. Recently, a few clinical studies have confirmed the role of adoptive T-cell transfer in the maintenance therapy of cancer patients. Here, we provided statistical insights into the role of CIKs in advanced lung cancer from three different levels, cell model (in vitro co-culture system), mice model (in situ lung cancer), and clinical research (in lung cancer patients of different progression stages). We optimized the components of supplements and cytokines on activating and expanding CIK cells. Based on this, we explored a new serum-free medium for in vitro activation and expansion of CIK cells. Moreover, we found that activated CIK cells could efficiently kill lung cancer cells in cell-to-cell model in vitro and significantly reduce the tumor growth in mice. For the clinical research, the OS rates of patients received combination of chemotherapy and CIK treatment were significantly improved compared to the OS rates of patients only received chemotherapy. Additionally, CIK therapy represented good toleration in our study. All the results suggested that combination of immunotherapy with traditional therapy will be a feasible and promising method for the treatment of lung cancer.
