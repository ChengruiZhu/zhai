Epigenetic regulator JMJD3 plays an important role in both tumor progression and somatic cell reprogramming. Here, we explored the effect of JMJD3 on the stem cell-like characteristics of breast cancer and its underlying mechanism involving stemness-related transcription factor Oct4. Our data revealed that, in breast cancer cells lines and an orthotopic xenograph mouse model of breast cancer, ectopic overexpression of JMJD3 suppressed stem cell-like characteristics of breast cancer cells, whereas knockdown of JMJD3 promoted these characteristics. Oct4 mediated the suppressive effects of JMJD3 on the stemness of breast cancer cells. The inhibitory effect of JMJD3 on Oct4 was independent of demethylase activity, but mediated via degradation of PHF20. Furthermore, we applied an agonist of the vitamin D receptor, paricalcitol, and found that it induced JMJD3 in breast cancer cells. Our data showed that administration of paricalcitol suppressed stem cell-like characteristics and Oct4 expression. Taken together, JMJD3 inhibits the stem cell-like characteristics in breast cancer by suppression of stemness factor Oct4 in a PHF20-dependent manner. Administration of paricalcitol leads to upregulation of JMJD3 that suppresses Oct4 expression and the stem cell-like characteristics in breast cancer.
