The objective of this study is to evaluate the effect of formulation variables on different evaluation properties such as cumulative percentage release and swelling index in development of two layered buccal mucoadhesive system consisting of a highly water soluble drug risedronate sodium. The mucoadhesive systems were developed with varied concentrations of the polymers (1-2%) using plasticizer/permeation enhancer (25–50% w/w of polymer). Two layered films comprised of risedronate sodium with chitosan (85% deacetylated) and hydroxypropylmethyl cellulose (HPMC 4KM) interpolymer complex of different ratios were prepared by solvent casting method. An impermeable backing membrane of ethyl cellulose was incorporated into the films. The study shows the effect of multipolymeric films on the release of a bisphosphonates derivative. The optimized formulations showed films with uniform drug content (90.91 ± 0.17–105.53% ± 2.15), thickness (0.22 ± 0.01 mm to 0.31 ± 0.06 mm), mucoadhesivity (26 ± 3.61–42.33 ± 2.82 g), and controlled drug release profile up to a period of 10 hours. The films were also studied for swelling index, moisture uptake, viscosity, folding endurance, water vapor transmission rate, and mucoadhesive time.
