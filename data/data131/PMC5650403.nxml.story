The aim of this study was to explore differences in the effects of modifiable factors on oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) occurring in the lower oral fissure (LOF) and upper oral fissure (UOF). We conducted a case-control study with 697 OSCC patients (119 UOF and 578 LOF) and 1910 frequency-matched controls in Fujian province, China. Data on demographic characteristics and possible modifiable factors was collected using a structured questionnaire. Unconditional logistic regression was utilized to calculate the odds ratios (ORs) and corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Alcohol drinking was more strongly associated with an increased risk of OSCC-LOF than OSCC-UOF. Tobacco smoking, the number of teeth lost ≥5, wearing denture, and recurrent oral ulceration showed similarly associations with OSCC-LOF and -UOF risk. Similarly, the beneficial effects of tea consumption, tooth-brushing ≥2times per day, high intake of fresh fish, seafood, green-leafy vegetables, other vegetables and fruits were not significantly different on OSCC-LOF and -UOF. Although most of the modifiable factors exert similar effects on both OSCC sites, this study suggests that the sites of oral cavity in LOF may be affected more by alcohol drinking than the sites in UOF. Further studies with larger samples are warranted to confirm our findings.
