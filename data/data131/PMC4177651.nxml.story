The ability of hesperidin (HP) to form complexes with five metals; cobalt, nickel, zinc, calcium and magnesium was investigated. The complexation was studied using U.V spectroscopic titration, in methanol as well as aqueous buffer solutions (physiological conditions). Potential complexes were studied by IR and NMR spectroscopy, melting point and their solubility were also evaluated. The interaction of HP and its metal complexes with DNA was investigated by U.V spectroscopy. HP and its potential complexes were also tested for their ability to inhibit alpha amylase and alpha glucosidase enzymes. The results indicated that HP can form 1:1 complexes with cobalt, nickel and zinc in methanolic solution but not in aqueous buffers. Both HP and its metal complexes were found to intercalate DNA, at physiological condition, with preference to GC rich sequences. HP-metal complexes appeared to have higher affinity towards poly A DNA than the free HP. Neither HP nor its complexes exhibited antimicrobial activity against Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa or Candida albicans. Results showed that HP has little inhibitory action on glucosidase and amylase enzymes with no obvious effect of complexation on the behavior of free HP.
