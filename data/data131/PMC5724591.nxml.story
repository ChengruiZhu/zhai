This article compares two algorithms for determining beam weights and wedge filters for conformal treatment planning. One algorithm, which is based on dose‐gradient analysis, provides analytic formulas for determining beam weights, wedge angles, and collimator angles (i.e., wedge orientations) so that the dose distribution is homogeneous in the target volume. The second algorithm is based on the concept of the super‐omni wedge (i.e., the arrangement of two pairs of orthogonal nominal wedged beams), numerically optimize beam weights, wedge angles, and collimator angles so that the dose requirements to targets and organs at risk are satisfied to the best. Three clinical cases were tested. For the first case, both algorithms resulted in comparable homogeneous dose distributions in the target volume. For the second case, the second algorithm resulted in much lower doses to the eyes plus a better homogeneous dose distribution in the target volume. For the third case, only the second algorithm was applicable, and the treatment plan it developed met the prescribed requirements. The results show that the first algorithm is better in terms of feasibility, whereas the second is better in terms of applicability and the quality of treatment plans.
