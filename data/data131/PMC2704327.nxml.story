Fatty liver is commonly associated with alcohol or metabolic syndrome. We aimed to examine the longitudinal aspects of fatty liver, and clarify the independent predictors for the development or regression of fatty liver. In the present study, the clinical features of 1578 Japanese adults (1208 men and 370 women; 35 to 69 years of age) who visited our center both in 2000 and 2007â€“2008 were recorded and compared, including liver status diagnosed by ultrasonography. Of the 1578 participants, 217 (13.8%) showed fatty liver development, and 74 (4.7%) showed fatty liver regression. Logistic regression analysis revealed that body mass index and percentage body fat were strongly associated with the development or regression of fatty liver. Metabolic syndrome-related disorders such as serum levels of total cholesterol, triglyceride, uric acid, and fasting blood glucose were also associated with clinical course to some degree. However, the history of alcohol intake, the presence of metabolic syndrome, blood pressure, and habitual physical exercise were not independent predictors for the development or regression of fatty liver. Our present data suggest that control of body weight in men and the percentage body fat in women are particularly important for the prevention or treatment of fatty liver.
