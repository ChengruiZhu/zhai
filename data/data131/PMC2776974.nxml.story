Centromeres tend to be the last regions to be assembled in genome projects, as their mapping is hampered by their characteristically high repeat DNA content and lack of genetic recombination. Using unique markers derived from these repeat-rich regions, we were able to generate and annotate physical maps of two maize centromeres. Functional centromeres are defined not so much by their primary DNA sequence as by the presence of CENH3, a special histone that replaces canonical histone H3 in centromeric nucleosomes. Little is known about how deposition of CENH3 is regulated, or about the interplay between centromeric repeats and CENH3. By graphing the density of CENH3 nucleosomes onto the physical map, we delineated the functional centromeres in today's maize genome. We then used the large number of LTR retrotransposon insertions, for which the corn genome is well known, as “archeological evidence” to reconstruct the historic centromere boundaries. This was possible because i) some retrotransposon families of maize (CRM) appear to possess a unique ability to preferentially target centromeres during integration and ii) insertion times of individual retrotransposons can be calculated. Here we show that the centromere boundaries in maize have changed over time and are heavily influenced by centromeric and non-centromeric repeats.
