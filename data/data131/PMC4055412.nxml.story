Cell function is determined by highly organized networks of biological molecules. An important class of protein pathways maintains the transmission of signals from the cell membrane to the nucleus. These signaling pathways are reused for different purposes at an evolutionary scale and in different cell types of the same organism. However, it is largely unknown how this flexibility is achieved and how this flexibility is balanced with the high degree of evolutionary conservation of some signaling proteins and the need for robustness against intra- and extra-cellular perturbations.We show how functional roles of signaling proteins determine patterns of evolutionary conservation, protein abundance (the average over different human cell lines and its variability) and disease mutations. Projecting pathway annotations on protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks, a picture emerges in which PPIs between variable and less conserved receptors and stable and conserved proteins of the core signal transmission machinery largely modulate signaling activity in a tissue-specific manner. This has important implications for the distribution of disease mutations in signaling pathways, which need to be considered for the understanding of their effect.
