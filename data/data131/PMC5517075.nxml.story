 is a good model to investigate this issue as tube size is strictly regulated. In addition, tracheal system development represents also an excellent system to study the molecular mechanisms employed by signalling pathways to instruct cells to form tubular structures. Here we describe that EGFR, which triggers one of the principal conserved pathways acting reiteratively during development and homeostasis, is required to restrict tube elongation. We find that EGFR regulates the accumulation and subcellular localisation of Crumbs and Serpentine, two factors previously known to regulate tube length. We show that Crumbs and Serpentine are loaded in common endosomes, which require EGFR for proper organisation, ensuring delivery of both cargoes to their final destination. We also report that during tracheal development the apical determinant Crumbs undergoes a complex pattern of recycling, which involves internalisation and different sorting pathways. Our analysis identifies EGFR as a hub to coordinate both cell intrinsic properties, namely Crumbs-dependant apical membrane growth, and extrinsic mechanisms, Serpentine-mediated extracellular matrix modifications, which regulate tube elongation. We suggest that the regulation of the endocytic traffic of specific cargoes could be one of the molecular mechanisms downstream of the EGFR, and therefore could regulate different morphogenetic and pathological EGFR-mediated events.
