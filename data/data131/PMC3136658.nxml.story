Nevi are important risk markers of melanoma. The study aim was to describe changes in nevi of children using longitudinal data from a population-based cohort. Overview back photography and dermoscopic imaging of up to 4 index back nevi was performed at age 11 (baseline) and repeated at age 14 (follow-up). Of 443 children (39% females) imaged at baseline, 366 children (39% females) had repeated imaging three year later. At age 14, median back nevus counts increased by 2; 75% of students (n=274) had at least one new back nevus and 28% (n=103) had at least one nevus that disappeared. Of 936 index nevi imaged dermoscopically at baseline and follow-up, 69% (645 nevi) had retained the same dermoscopic classification from baseline evaluation. Only 4% (n=13) of nevi assessed as globular at baseline were classified as reticular at follow-up, and just 3% (n=3) of baseline reticular nevi were classified as globular at follow-up. Of 9 (1%) index nevi that disappeared at follow-up, none showed halo or regression at baseline. In conclusion, the relative stability of dermoscopic pattern of individual nevi in the face of the overall volatility of nevi during adolescence suggests that specific dermoscopic patterns may represent distinct biologic nevus subsets.
