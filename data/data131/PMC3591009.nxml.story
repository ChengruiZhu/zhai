Osteosarcomas (OS) are extremely uncommon in maxillofacial region (6%-10% of all sarcomas). Jaw lesions are diagnosed on average two decades later than sarcomas of long bone, with a peak incidence between 20 and 40 years. Head and neck OS (HNOS) are associated with a lower metastatic rate than long bone OS, and they have a better 5-year survival rate, ranging between 27% and 84%. Approximately 80% of HNOS originate from soft tissues, while 20% arise from bone. The majority of OS were classified as osteoblastic HNOS (77.0%), followed by chondroblastic (15.8%) and fibroblastic (3.4%). Patients older than 60 years were more likely to be diagnosed with other histologic types compared with patients 60 years or younger. The authors describe a rare case of Stage II high-grade mixed chondroblastic and fibroblastic osteosarcoma of the upper jaw diagnosed in a subject older than 60 years. CT i.e., total body scintigraphy, radiograph of chest, and epathic ultrasonography have been executed to staging (T3N0M0). The size of the tumor >6 cm, histopathological findings, and patient older than 60 years, made necessary a multimodality therapy. Surgery (right subtotal maxillectomy with closure of surgical area by local sliding and advanced cheek flap) and adjuvant radiotherapy (for overall 6500 Gy) were the definitive treatment. Follow-up at 2 years shows no local recurrence and the patient is disease free.
