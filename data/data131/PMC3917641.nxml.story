Objectives: The aim of this study was to estimate the prevalence of dental erosion and to investigate possible associations among dental erosion and medical history, dietary and lifestyle habits in a sample of adolescents in Greece. 
Study design: The study sample consisted of 770 adolescents, 374 boys and 396 girls aged 13 to 16 years. All individuals were clinically examined and answered questions regarding their medical history, rate and frequency of drinks and food consumption and lifestyle habits. Statistical analysis of the questionnaire items was performed by using the multiple logistic regression analysis model. 
Results: Two hundreds and sixty adolescents were diagnosed as having dental erosion, giving a prevalence rate 33.8%. The habit of holding drinks in the mouth before swallowing [OR=2.85, 95% CI=1.45-5.58] (p=0.002), the ingestion of acidic drinks at bedtime [OR=0.24, 95% CI=0.11-0.53] (p=0.000), the consumption of car- bonated drinks [OR=3.99, 95% CI=1.37-11.59] (p=0.011) and fruit juices [OR=0.12, 95% CI=0.04-0.38] (p=0.000) were the most important associated factors of dental erosion. 
Conclusions: The prevalence of dental erosion in the study sample was 33.8% while dental erosion experience was associated with frequency and habits of consumption of some dietary components.
