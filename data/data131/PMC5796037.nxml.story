Gastric cancer (GC) is the second most frequent cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide. MicroRNAs are single-stranded RNA molecules of 21–23 nucleotides that regulate target gene expression through specific base-pairing interactions between miRNA and untranslated regions of targeted mRNAs. In this study, we generated a multistep approach for the integrated analysis of miRNA and mRNA expression. First, both miRNA and mRNA expression profiling datasets in gastric cancer from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) and The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) identified 79 and 1042 differentially expressed miRNAs and mRNAs, respectively, in gastric cancer. Second, inverse correlations between miRNA and mRNA expression levels identified 3206 miRNA–mRNA pairs combined with 79 dysregulated miRNAs and their 774 target mRNAs predicted by three prediction tools, miRanda, PITA, and RNAhybrid. Additionally, miR-204, which was found to be down-regulated in gastric cancer, was ectopically over-expressed in the AGS gastric cancer cell line and all down-regulated targets were identified by RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) analysis. Over-expression of miR-204 reduced the gastric cancer cell proliferation and suppressed the expression of three targets which were validated by qRT-PCR and luciferase assays. For the first time, we identified that
