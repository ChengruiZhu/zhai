Here, a case of Ewingâ€™s sarcoma family of tumors (ESFT) of the femur with an unusual clinical course is reported. At 20 years of age, the patient had undergone curettage of a bone tumor of the right femur which was diagnosed as ESFT. One cycle of chemotherapy with vincristine and cyclophosphamide and radiotherapy for a total dose of 40 Gy was administered. The patient did not develop any recurrence or metastases for the following 18 years, in spite of the inadequacy of the initial treatment. At 38 years of age, he was referred to our institution with right thigh pain that had persisted for several months. Radiographs and magnetic resonance imaging findings showed a mass lesion in his proximal femur extending to the soft tissue. An open biopsy was performed and the lesion was diagnosed as recurrence of ESFT, although a molecular biological investigation did not reveal any expression of the characteristic fusion genes that have previously been reported. The patient received standard multimodal therapy employing standard combination chemo-therapy for ESFT and wide surgical excision. The patient has been disease-free for 9 years since the treatment. This patient may have a rare subtype of ESFT with an unknown chromosomal translocation and relatively non-aggressive biological behavior.
