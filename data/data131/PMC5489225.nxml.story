Most contemporary studies of gene-environment interactions focus on gene variants that are known to bear strong and reliable associations with the traits of interest. The strategy is intuitive because it helps limit the number of tests performed by focusing on a relatively small number of gene variants. However, this approach is predicated on an implicit assumption that these loci are strong candidates for interactions owing to their established relationships with the index traits. The counter-argument is that, because these loci have highly consistent signals within and between populations that vary by environmental characteristics, the probability that these variants interact with other factors is low. The current analysis tests whether variants with strong marginal effects signals (i.e., those prioritized through conventional genome-wide association analyses) are strong or weak candidates for gene-environment interactions. Here we describe analyses focused on lipids and BMI that test this hypothesis by comparing marginal effect signals with variance effect signals and those derived from explicit genome-wide, gene-environment interaction analyses. We conclude that for BMI, there are features of the top-ranking marginal effect loci that render them stronger candidates for interactions than is true of variants with weaker marginal effects signals. These findings are likely to help optimize the efficiency of future gene-environment interaction analyses by providing evidence-based rankings for strong candidate loci.
