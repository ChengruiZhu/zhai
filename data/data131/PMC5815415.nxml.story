A validity test was conducted to determine how care level–based nurse-to-resident ratios compare with actual daily care times per resident in Germany. Stability across different long-term care facilities was tested. Care level–based nurse-to-resident ratios were compared with the standard minimum nurse-to-resident ratios. Levels of care are determined by classification authorities in long-term care insurance programs and are used to distribute resources. Care levels are a powerful tool for classifying authorities in long-term care insurance. We used observer-based measurement of assignable direct and indirect care time in 68 nursing units for 2028 residents across 2 working days. Organizational data were collected at the end of the quarter in which the observation was made. Data were collected from January to March, 2012. We used a null multilevel model with random intercepts and multilevel models with fixed and random slopes to analyze data at both the organization and resident levels. A total of 14% of the variance in total care time per day was explained by membership in nursing units. The impact of care levels on care time differed significantly between nursing units. Forty percent of residents at the lowest care level received less than the standard minimum registered nursing time per day. For facilities that have been significantly disadvantaged in the current staffing system, a higher minimum standard will function more effectively than a complex classification system without scientific controls.
