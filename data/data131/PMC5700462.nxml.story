Establishing low‐cost, high‐throughput, simple, and accurate single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) genotyping techniques is beneficial for understanding the intrinsic relationship between individual genetic variations and their biological functions on a genomic scale. Here, a straightforward and reliable single‐molecule approach is demonstrated for precise SNP authentication by directly measuring the fluctuations in electrical signals in an electronic circuit, which is fabricated from a high‐gain field‐effect silicon nanowire decorated with a single hairpin DNA, in the presence of different target DNAs. By simply comparing the proportion difference of a probe‐target duplex structure throughout the process, this study implements allele‐specific and accurate SNP detection. These results are supported by the statistical analyses of different dynamic parameters such as the mean lifetime and the unwinding probability of the duplex conformation. In comparison with conventional polymerase chain reaction and optical methods, this convenient and label‐free method is complementary to existing optical methods and also shows several advantages, such as simple operation and no requirement for fluorescent labeling, thus promising a futuristic route toward the next‐generation genotyping technique.
