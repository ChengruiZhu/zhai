Base-pairing of box C/D small nucleolar RNAs (snoRNAs) with the target RNA guides site-specific ribose methylation by fibrillarin (Nop1), a highly conserved methyltransferase. Some box C/D snoRNAs, like yeast U3, U14 and U8 in higher eukaryotes are not involved in methylation but are essential for pre-rRNA processing. Biochemical and computational analyses have led to the identification and characterization of most box C/D snoRNA targets. Several snoRNAs classified as ‘orphan’ snoRNAs lack a guide sequence or have complementarity to RNA that is not characterized. Considering the recent number of studies underscoring association of box C/D snoRNAs with genetic disorders including Prader–Willi Syndrome (PWS), cancer and obesity, it is feasible that apart from ribose methylation and RNA processing, these snoRNAs are involved in several other cellular processes. Here, we report a novel and unexpected function for two yeast orphan box C/D snoRNAs, snR4 and snR45, in site-specific base acetylation. We demonstrate that these box C/D snoRNAs guide cytosine acetylation by Kre33, a factor essential for assembly and processing of the 90S pre-ribosome. Kre33 is known to acetylate a subset of tRNAs with the help of the adaptor protein Tan1. However, here we show Kre33 dependent acetylation of 18S rRNA is guided by orphan snoRNAs. Our results expand the functional repertoire of box C/D snoRNPs and highlight yet another remarkable cellular modularity, where a single enzyme targets different substrates by means of either protein or RNA adaptors.
