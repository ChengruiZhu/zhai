 study has shown that mTOR inhibitors, together with cytotoxic agents, exhibit tumor cell killing activity. A number of non-randomized studies in HER2-positive trastuzumab-resistant metastatic breast cancer have revealed the antitumor activity of mTOR inhibitors when used together with standard chemotherapy plus trastuzumab. In the present study, the expression levels of phosphorylated (p)-mTOR and p-4E-BP1 were analyzed in breast cancer patients prior to and following NAC, to determine whether p-mTOR and p-4E-BP1 affect the response to NAC and the subsequent survival. Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissues representing matched pairs of core biopsy (pre-NAC) and surgical specimen (post-NAC) from 83 patients with invasive ductal carcinomas were collected. Immunohistochemistry was performed to evaluate the expression of p-mTOR and p-4E-BP1 using a semi-quantitative scoring system by two pathologists. It was found that the expression of p-mTOR and p-4E-BP1 was downregulated following NAC. The decrease in mTOR expression following NAC was found to positively correlate with HER2 expression and the reduction of tumor sizes. The high expression of p-mTOR and p-4E-BP1 in pre-NAC specimens was associated with poor disease-free survival (DFS). Furthermore, the high expression of p-mTOR in post-NAC specimens was associated with poor DFS, regardless of whether the expression was high or low in the pre-NAC specimens. In conclusion, NAC was found to decrease the expression levels of p-mTOR and p-4E-BP1. The p-mTOR expression post-NAC may potentially serve as a predictor for DFS. However, further study is required to clarify the mechanism and to evaluate the predictive value of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/Akt/mTOR/4E-BP1 pathway in NAC.
