Genomes from different organisms produce noncoding RNAs that are not translated to make proteins and whose functions are largely unknown. There are approximately 2,000 noncoding RNAs that make up almost 25% of the yeast genome compared to the approximately 6,000 protein coding genes that make up 70% of the yeast genome. With this large number of ncRNAs there is a need for large-scale studies to determine the functional roles of ncRNAs. We take advantage of a recently developed resource of 532 yeast strains in which individual noncoding RNA genes have been deleted. We grow these yeast noncoding RNA deletion strains in different conditions and catalogue how each noncoding RNA contributes to cell growth. Improvement or inhibition of cell growth under particular conditions implicates the deleted RNA in cellular responses to those conditions. We have also investigated in more detail the function of specific noncoding RNAs, revealing examples of how a deletion influences nearby genes, and other examples of noncoding RNAs that regulate genes at distant genomic locations. We have made our extensive data on the fitness of noncoding RNA deletion mutants publically available for searching and bulk download in a new online resource, called
