MiR-374a appears to play a complex role in non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Here, we demonstrate a dual role for miR-374a in NSCLC pathogenesis. The effects and modulatory mechanisms of miR-374a on cell growth, migration, invasion, and in vivo tumorigenesis and metastasis in nude mice were also analyzed. The expression of miR-374a was examined in NSCLC and non-cancerous lung tissues by quantitative real-time reverse transcription-PCR (qRT-PCR), and in situ hybridization, respectively. miR-374a directly targets CCND1 and inactivates PI3K/AKT and Ras-mediated cell cycle signalings, as well as epithelial–mesenchymal transition (EMT). This not only dramatically suppressed cell growth, migration, invasion,and metastasis, but also elevated A549 and pc-9 NSCLC cell sensitivity to cisplatin (DDP) while increasing survival time of tumor-bearing mice. Interestingly, miR-374a serves an inverse function in SPCA-1 and H1975 NSCLC cells by directly targeting PTEN to activate Wnt/β-catenin and Ras signalings and its downstream cascade signals. Surprisingly, transcription factor c-Jun bound to the promoter region of human miR-374a and suppressed miR-374a in A549 and pc-9 cells while inducing it in SPCA-1 and H1975 cells. Increased levels of miR-374a appeared to serve a protective role by targeting CCND1 in early-stage NSCLC (Stages I and II). Inversely, increased miR-374a was an unfavorable factor when targeting PTEN in more advanced staged NSCLC patients. Our studies are the first to demonstrate that miR-374a plays divergent roles in NSCLC pathogenesis at different stages of the disease and implicate the potential application of miR-374a targeting for cancer therapy.
