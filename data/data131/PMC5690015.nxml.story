); and 2) Gafchromic EBT3 film parallel to beam in acrylic slab to assess changes in surface and percent depth doses in PA geometry. To assess sensitivity of delivered dose to variations in patient lateral position, measurements at central axis using the pinpoint chamber geometry were taken at lateral couch displacements of 2, 5, and 10 mm for 6 MV FFF. The maximum percent difference for point‐dose measurements was 3.24% (6 MV FFF) and 2.30% (10 MV FFF). The average percent difference for point‐dose measurements was less than 1.10% for all beam energies and rail geometries. The maximum percent difference between calculated and measured dose can be as large as 13.0% if no couch model is used for dose calculation. The presence of the couch structures also impacts surface dose and PDD, which was evaluated with Gafchromic film measurements. The upstream shift in the depth of dose maximum (dmax) was found to be 10.5 mm for 6 MV FFF and 5.5 mm for 10 MV FFF for ‘Rails In’ configuration. Transmission of the treatment beam through the couch results in an increase in surface dose (absolute percentage) of approximately 50% for both photon energies (6 MV FFF and 10 MV FFF). The largest sensitivity to lateral shifts occurred at the lateral boundary of the rail structures. The mean magnitude (standard deviation) of the deviation between shifted and centered measurements over all field sizes tested was 0.61% (0.61%) for 2 mm shifts, 0.46% (0.67%) for 5 mm shifts, and 0.86% (1.46%) for 10 mm shifts.
