WD repeat protein 79 (WDR79) is a member of the WD-repeat protein family and functions as a scaffold protein during telomerase assembly, Cajal body formation and DNA double strand break repair. We have previously shown that WDR79 is frequently overexpressed in cell lines and tissues derived from non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and it accelerates cell proliferation in NSCLC. However, the detailed mechanism underlying the role of WDR79 in the proliferation of NSCLC cells remains unclear. Here, we report the discovery of a molecular interaction between WDR79 and USP7 and show its functional significance in linking the Mdm2-p53 pathway to the proliferation of NSCLC cells. We found that WDR79 colocalized and interacted with USP7 in the nucleus of NSCLC cells. This event, in turn, reduced the ubiquitination of Mdm2 and p53, thereby increasing the stability and extending the half-life of the two proteins. We further found that the functional effects of WDR79 depended upon USP7, because the knockdown of USP7 resulted in their attenuation. Finally, we demonstrated that WDR79 promoted the proliferation of NSCLC cells via USP7. Taken together, our findings reveal a novel molecular function of WDR79 and may lead to broadly applicable and innovative therapeutic avenues for NSCLC.
