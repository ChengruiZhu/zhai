Cockayne syndrome is a devastating inherited disease; the average life span of those afflicted is 12 years. Cockayne syndrome patients have features of premature aging, are highly sensitive to sunlight, and suffer from numerous developmental and neurological disorders. The majority of Cockayne syndrome patients have mutations in the CSB protein; however, how these mutations can lead to Cockayne syndrome is largely unknown. CSB is essential for transcription-coupled DNA repairâ€”a process that preferentially removes bulky DNA lesions that stall transcription, such as those created by ultraviolet light. In eukaryotes, DNA is packaged into nucleosomes, which consists of DNA wrapped around a set of core histone proteins, and nucleosomes can create barriers to the DNA repair process. In this study, we found that CSB can slide histones along DNA. We also found that histone chaperones, proteins that accept and donate histones, greatly facilitate this process. Importantly, we show that CSB derivatives that are unable to move nucleosomes or collaborate with histone chaperones cannot repair UV-induced DNA lesions. Our study reveals that nucleosome remodeling by CSB is important for transcription-coupled DNA repair and suggests that an inability to efficiently mobilize nucleosomes might contribute to the underlying mechanism of Cockayne syndrome.
