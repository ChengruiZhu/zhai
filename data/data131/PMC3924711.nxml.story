Atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome (aHUS) is a rare thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA) characterized by the triad of hemolytic anemia, thrombocytopenia, and acute renal failure. Eculizumab, a monoclonal complement C5 antibody which prevents the induction of the terminal complement cascade, has recently emerged as a therapeutic option for aHUS. We report a case of aHUS successfully treated with eculizumab. A 51-year-old male was admitted to the hospital following a mechanical fall. His past medical history was significant for rheumatic valve disease and mitral valve replacement; he was on warfarin for anticoagulation. A computed tomography scan of the head revealed a right-sided subdural hematoma due to coagulopathy resulting from a supratherapeutic international normalized ratio (INR). Following treatment with prothrombin complex concentrate to reverse the INR, urine output dropped and his serum creatinine subsequently increased to 247.52 μmol/l from the admission value of 70.72 μmol/l. Laboratory evaluation was remarkable for hemolytic anemia, thrombocytopenia, elevated lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), low haptoglobin, and low complement C3. A renal biopsy was consistent with TMA, favoring a diagnosis of aHUS. Treatment with eculizumab was initiated which resulted in the stabilization of his hemoglobin, platelets, and LDH. Hemodialysis was terminated after 2.5 months due to improvement in urine output and solute clearance. The interaction between thrombin and complement pathway might be responsible for the pathogenesis of aHUS in this case. Eculizumab is an effective therapeutic agent in the treatment of aHUS. Early targeting of the complement system may modify disease progression and thus treat aHUS more effectively.
