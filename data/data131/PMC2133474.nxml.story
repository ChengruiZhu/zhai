 1. A group of 34 monkeys were infected intracerebrally with 0.1 cc. of a 10 per cent virus suspension. Following infection, 9 animals were treated with daily injections of 700 to 100 mg., 16 with 50 to 10 mg. and 9 with 5 mg. of vitamin C for a period of 2 weeks. In the whole group there were 6 animals that survived without showing any evidence of paralysis. 2 of these had received 50 to 10 mg. while 4 had received 5 mg. All of 19 untreated control monkeys, infected simultaneously with the same amount of virus, developed paralysis. 2. Another group of 6 monkeys were infected intracerebrally with 0.05 cc. of virus. Following infection, one animal was treated in the same manner with 25 mg. and 5 with 5 mg. of vitamin C. In the whole group there was one animal that survived without showing any evidence of paralysis. This animal had received 5 mg. All of 7 untreated control monkeys, infected simultaneously with the same amount of virus, developed paralysis. 3. A third group of 22 monkeys were infected intracerebrally with 0.01 cc. of virus. Following infection, one animal was treated in the same manner with 100 mg., 2 with 50 to 10 mg., and 19 with 5 mg. of vitamin C. In the whole group there were 12 animals that survived without showing any evidence of paralysis. One of these had received 10 mg., while 11 had received 5 mg. Of 12 untreated control monkeys, infected simultaneously with the same amount of virus, 2 failed to show any paralytic symptoms and 10 developed paralysis. 4. A summary of the results obtained in all three groups shows: (
