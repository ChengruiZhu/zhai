 Associated with the intoxication of intestinal obstruction there exists a definite impairment of the excretory function of the kidneys. The degree of functional depression corresponds roughly with the intensity of the clinical intoxication. The decrease in the urea ratio and in the capacity of the kidneys to excrete sodium chloride is more marked than is the percentage decrease of phenolsulfonephthalein elimination. The great increase in the non-protein nitrogen of the blood usually observed in acute intestinal obstruction, which has hitherto been explained as being due entirely to an increased rate of protein catabolism, is due in part to retention of the products released from the injured cell protein. It is probable that the impaired renal function is due to direct action of the toxic substances upon the renal epithelium. The actual demonstration of this renal injury is perhaps the strongest evidence so far obtained to prove the presence of an actual toxic substance in the blood during intestinal obstruction. This obscure disability of the kidneys during the height of the intoxication of acute ileus should always be considered in the clinical management of this condition. It may also serve as a guide to indicate the degree of intoxication.
