The cellular basis for the adaptive immune response during antigen recognition relies on a specialized protein interface known as the immunological synapse (IS). Understanding the biophysical basis for protein patterning by deciphering the quantitative rules for their formation and motion is an important aspect of characterizing immune cell recognition and thence the rules for immune system activation. We propose a minimal mathematical model for the physical basis of dynamic membrane protein patterning in the IS, which encompass membrane mechanics, protein binding kinetics and motion, and fluid flow in the synaptic cleft. In particular we quantify the nucleation, growth and stabilization of proteins domains. We describe a phase diagram of possible protein patterns by two dimensionless parameters; a ratio of membrane elasticity to protein stiffness, and the ratio of a hydrodynamic time scale for fluid flow relative to the protein binding rate. Direct comparison with experiment suggests that passive processes i.e. viscous fluid flow, elastic membrane bending and protein binding kinetics, can describe the short-time formation and transport of protein clusters, while active cytoskeletal processes enable long-time stabilization of the IS.
