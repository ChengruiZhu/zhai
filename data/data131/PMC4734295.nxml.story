Tumor-like hypophysitis is an uncommon sellar condition that presents as inflammatory lesions on the structures of the pituitary gland. The diagnosis and management of hypophysitis poses a significant challenge, as its clinical manifestation and appearance in imaging studies are difficult to distinguish from that of pituitary tumors. The present retrospective study summarizes two rare cases of primary granulomatous hypophysitis, two cases of lymphocytic hypophysitis, and three cases in which a pathological diagnosis was not determined due to the use of hormone replacement therapy only. The mean age of the patients studied was 45.71Â±22.16 years, and the patients comprised two males and five females. The clinical signs of hypophysitis included headache, fever, gradual decrease in visual acuity, nausea and vomiting. Enhanced magnetic resonance imaging revealed sellar and pituitary stalk lesions, with iso- or hypodense signals on T1-weighted images. Transsphenoidal surgery was performed in three cases. It was challenging to diagnose hypophysitis due to the lack of any significant specific clinical signs. A transsphenoidal biopsy with fast-frozen pathology is able to diagnose hypophysitis. Glucocorticoid therapy may be a potential treatment for hypophysitis, as complete removal of pituitary masses may disable pituitary function.
