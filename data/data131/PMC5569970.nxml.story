) in the regulation of the epithelial phenotype in cells of breast derived, non-malignant, MCF10A cell line. GRAF1 was shown to be localized to cell-cell junctions, and its depletion resulted in accelerated cell migration velocity, elongation of the cells and cell colonies, impaired monolayer integrity and significant disruption of desmosomes with a loss of associated keratin filaments. These processes were accompanied by formation of larger focal adhesions, an increased number of contractile actin stress fibers, reduction in epithelial markers and increase in mesenchymal markers such as epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT)-specific transcription factors Snail-1 and Snail-2, as well as N-cadherin, and vimentin. Moreover, unlike control cells, GRAF1 knocked-down cells demonstrated anchorage-independent growth in soft agar. GRAF1 expression in several highly invasive breast cancer cell lines was low, as compared to the non-malignant MCF10A cells, while overexpressing of GRAF1 in the malignant BT-549 cell line led to a decrease of mesenchymal markers, especially the Snail-1 and 2. Altogether, our analysis suggests that GRAF1 plays a role in the maintenance of normal epithelial phenotype and its depletion leads to an EMT-like process that might be involved in neoplastic transformation.
