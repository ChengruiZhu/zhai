We searched several scientific databases and conference proceedings up to March 15, 2010 for controlled studies comparing target vessel revascularization (TVR) between DES and BMS. Summary odds ratios (OR) for the primary endpoint TVR and secondary endpoints infarction, stent thrombosis and death were calculated using random-effect models. A total of 29 studies (3 randomized controlled trials RCT) involving 7549 (202 in RCT) patients were included. The need for target vessel revascularization in the DES group tended to be lower compared to BMS for the 3 RCT (OR 0.50 [0.24–1.00]; p = 0.051) and for observational studies (0.62 [0.49–0.79]; p<0.001). There was no significant difference in the risk for myocardial infarction in the RCT (OR 1.25 [0.22–6.99]; p = 0.250) but a lower risk for DES based on the observational studies 0.68 [0.49–0.95]; p = 0.023. The risk for stent thrombosis was found to be non-different in the RCT (OR 0.78 [0.03–21.73], p = 0.885) while it was in favor of DES in the observational studies (0.58 [0.38 – 0.84]; p<0.001). The mortality was not significantly different between DES and BMS in the RCT's (OR 2.22 [0.17 – 29.50]; p = 0.546) while the observation studies showed a decreased mortality in the DES group (0.69 [0.55–0.85]; p<0.001).
