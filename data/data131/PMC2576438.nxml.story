Non-coding RNAs have been shown to modulate transcriptional expression of genes in human cells. This form of gene regulation has been shown to be the result of RNA directing silent state epigenetic changes to the targeted gene promoter. Shortly after this seminal observation, small RNAs targeted to AT-rich regions of gene promoters were shown to modulate gene activation, termed RNA activation. While much is known regarding non-coding RNA-mediated transcriptional gene silencing, the mechanism of RNA activation has remained elusive. Here, we present evidence that RNA activation is the result of deregulation of endogenous bidirectional transcription. The antisense transcript in the bidirectionally transcribed gene is shown here to be operative in directing silent state epigenetic marks to the sense gene promoter. Suppression of the antisense transcript results in gene activation. Overall, these data support the notion that bidirectional transcription is an endogenous mechanism whereby RNA-directed gene regulation is operative and that RNA activation is the result of a disruption of this endogenous pathway. An understanding of this mode of RNA-based regulation will prove exceptionally useful in understanding gene expression as well as potential therapeutic approaches to controlling gene expression in human cells.
