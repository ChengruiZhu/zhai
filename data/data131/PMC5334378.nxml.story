B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia (B-CLL) presents with progressive accumulation of monoclonal B cells in the peripheral blood, bone marrow and lymphoid organs. B-CLL is characterized by heterogeneous clinical outcome. The expression of Toll-like receptors (TLRs) and their association with other prognostic factors in B-CLL patients remain unclear. The aim of our study was to evaluate the expression of TLR2, TLR4 and TLR9 genes and their significance as biological markers in patients with B-CLL. Sixty patients with newly diagnosed B-CLL were evaluated. The healthy control group included 20 age-matched individuals. Using quantitative reverse transcriptase PCR, the mRNA expression of genes TLR2, TLR4 and TLR9 was measured. TLR4 gene expression was lower in B-CLL patients as compared to the control group and TLR2 gene expression was higher in B-CLL patients than in healthy individuals. TLR9 gene expression was higher in the control group than in patients with B-CLL. TLR4 mRNA expression was lower in patients with advanced-stage CLL (Rai stages III and IV) than in patients with early stage disease (Rai stages 0–II). TLR2 gene expression was higher in patients with advanced-stage CLL (Rai stages III and IV) than in patients with early stage disease (Rai stages 0–II;
