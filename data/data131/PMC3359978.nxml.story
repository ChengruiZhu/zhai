Synaptic transmission is mainly mediated by the triggered release of neurotransmitters from synaptic vesicles (SVs). To regulate synaptic transmission and neuronal activity, neurons also release neuropeptides and hormones from dense core vesicles (DCVs). While SVs can be recycled locally at the synapse, DCVs have to be newly synthesized in the cell body after release. The formation of new DCVs requires a multi-step maturation process. During this maturation, the neuropeptides are processed into their active form and factors that would disturb DCV release are removed. Only properly matured DCVs are able to undergo efficient release after stimulation. Since DCV biogenesis mainly uses the normal secretory pathway, an elaborate machinery must exist that guarantees efficient sorting and retention of DCV cargo. Previously, we identified the small GTPase RAB-2 and its effector RIC-19/ICA69 to be involved in the retention of soluble cargo in DCVs. In a screen for molecules that regulate RAB-2 activity during DCV maturation, we identified the evolutionarily conserved TBC domain-containing protein, TBC-8. We demonstrate that TBC-8 is a putative RAB-2 GAP, which also binds to RIC-19/ICA69. Thus, RAB-2 might recruit its own GAP via its effector RIC-19, which suggests that a highly dynamic cycling of RAB-2 is required for DCV maturation.
