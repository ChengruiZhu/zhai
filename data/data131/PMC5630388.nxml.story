Accumulating evidence shows the important role of long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) in competing endogenous RNA (ceRNA) networks for predicting survival in tumor patients. However, prognostic biomarkers for lung squamous cell carcinoma (LUSC) are still lacking. The objective of this study is to identify a lncRNA signature for evaluation of overall survival (OS) in 474 LUSC patients from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database. A total of 474 RNA sequencing profiles in LUSC patients with clinical data were obtained, providing a large sample of RNA sequencing data, and 83 LUSC-specific lncRNAs, 26 miRNAs, and 85 mRNAs were identified to construct the ceRNA network (fold change>2, P<0.05). Among these above 83 LUSC-specific lncRNAs, 22 were assessed as closely related to OS in LUSC patients using a univariate Cox proportional regression model. Meanwhile, two (FMO6P and PRR26) of the above 22 OS-related lncRNAs were identified using a multivariate Cox regression model to construct a risk score as an independent indicator of the prognostic value of the lncRNA signature in LUSC patients. LUSC patients with low-risk scores were more positively correlated with OS (P<0.001). The present study provides a deeper understanding of the lncRNA-related ceRNA network in LUSC and suggests that the two-lncRNA signature could serve as an independent biomarker for prognosis of LUSC.
