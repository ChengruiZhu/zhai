Mechanisms that regulate the tolerance to dietary proteins or the loss of this and subsequent development of disease are poorly understood. In food allergy, there is growing awareness of the urgency in understanding these events to aid in the development of next-generation therapies and interventions. This review focuses on the accumulating evidence related to food allergy that develops after transplantation. This intriguing immunological phenomenon has been described in several different types of transplant settings and to variety of different foods. We outline these studies and the evidence from them that support transplant-acquired food allergy being a process regulated by both the donor allergic status and the recipient genetics and treatments. A number of key risk factors seem prevalent throughout transplant-acquired food allergy and include type of transplant, age and general health of the recipient, modality of immunosuppression and potentially the genetics of both donor and recipient. Importantly, these studies provide a window into better general understanding of food allergy, and facilitate clearer understanding of the critical immunological and epidemiological factors needed to allow the adoptive transfer of a food-specific allergic disease from one individual to another.
