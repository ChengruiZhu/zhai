Objective: This study aims to analyze the stress of the students from the nursing department within the Medical Midwife and Nurse School from our University. Subjects and methods: For this purpose a questionnaire, comprising the factors the students consider important for their academic preparation during the first year, was elaborated and applied to 100 students. Results: The result analysis revealed no significant differences as far as the genders of the subjects were concerned. In the same way, the prior academic background or the student experience did not influence the level of stress. The social and economic factors seem to be involved in choosing a career and thus influence the academic stress. For this purpose, a questionnaire comprising the factors the students consider important for their academic preparation during the first year, was elaborated and applied to 100 students. We used the Students t-test to determine differences between groups and considered p<0.05 as significant. Conclusions: The stress equally affects the nursing department students, regardless of their gender or prior studies. Social and economic factors play a role in adapting to a new academic environment, having higher expectations and requirements.
