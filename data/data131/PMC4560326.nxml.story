Sorafenib is an effective treatment for unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) characterized by disease stabilization. However, the response rates are very low (<9%percnt;), and a complete response is rarely achieved. We report an extremely rare case of a HCC patient with multiple lung metastases treated with sorafenib who achieved a complete response for a long period. A 77-year-old woman was diagnosed with chronic hepatitis C in 1990. In 2007, a HCC detected in the liver was treated with percutaneous ethanol injection therapy. Subsequently, recurrence of HCC in the liver was treated with microwave coagulonecrotic therapy in 2010. In April 2011, a computed tomography (CT) scan revealed innumerable multiple metastases spread diffusely in both lungs. Tumor marker levels were extremely high [α-fetoprotein (AFP) 76,170 ng/ml, lens culinaris agglutinin-reactive fraction of AFP 7.5%percnt;, des-γ-carboxyprothrombin (DCP) 63,400 mAU/ml]. Sorafenib was administered at a reduced dose of 400 mg/day because of old age. Four months after sorafenib treatment, AFP and DCP had decreased to within normal levels, and the multiple lung metastases had disappeared. Currently, sorafenib is administered at a reduced dose of 400 mg/day, and the complete response has been maintained for 48 months.
