It was possible to terminate the induced unresponsive state to bovine serum albumin (BSA) and the natural unresponsive state to autologous thyroglobulin in rabbits (RTg) by immunization with complexes composed of heterologous cross-reacting antibody and the tolerated antigens. The unresponsive state was terminated in rabbits made unresponsive by neonatal injections of BSA and then 3 mo later injected with complexes composed of BSA and guinea pig antihuman serum albumin. This termination was manifested by the presence of anti-BSA plaque-forming cells. Similarly, the natural unresponsive state was terminated in adult rabbits injected with complexes between RTg and guinea pig antibovine thyroglobulin (BTg) in that thyroid lesions and circulating anti-RTg were produced. The results can be best explained by the presence of unresponsive T cells and competent B cells, where the guinea pig gamma globulin (antibody) activates T cells specific for the guinea pig gamma globulin portion of the complexes and thus permits stimulation of B cells competent to the exposed determinants of the tolerated (BSA or RTg) portion of the complexes. The detailed mechanism for the activation of B cells in tolerant animals is discussed.
