The inhibition of adhesion between aggregates and layers of embryonic retinal cells by concanavalin A (Con A) and Con A-mediated rearrangements of Con A receptors on retinal cells were studied. A short incubation of aggregates and layers with 10 micrograms/ml Con A substantially reduced aggregate-to-layer adhesion in a subsequent assay without soluble lectin present. This effect of Con A was dose- dependent, temperature-sensitive, involved events subsequent to Con A binding, and was reduced by cytochalasin B. The inhibition produced by succinylated Con A was substantially increased by incubation with antibody to Con A. Visualization of ConA- receptor complexes by fluorescence microscopy revealed that binding of Con A induced clearing of Con A receptors from filopodia, flattened regions of growth cones, and the edges of axons. This clearing reaction was prevented by the same agents that reduced Con A's inhibition of cell adhesion: low temperature, succinylation of Con A, or cytochalasin B. Aggregate-layer adhesion was restored by releasing Con A at 37 degrees C. Inhibitors of protein and ATP synthesis did not prevent recovery of ability to make adhesions. However, release of Con A at lowered temperatures did not prevent recovery. The results suggest that intercellular adhesion is inhibited by events associated with redistribution of Con A-receptor complexes on retinal cells.
