 in cultures, it was found that they failed to develop at a temperature ranging from 2.5–8°C., but developed slowly at a temperature of 11.5–13.5°C. The minimum temperature for development seems to lie between 8° and 11.5–13.5°C. At temperatures ranging in various cultures from 18–29°C. ova developed to their final stage in 7 to 12 days. Undeveloped ova subjected to a freezing temperature for a period of 4 days were viable at the end of that time. Fully developed ones remained alive when exposed out of doors for a period of 7 days at a temperature ranging from 5–62°F. Undeveloped ova survived desiccation at room temperature for a period of 16 days, but not for 41 days. Fully developed eggs were alive after desiccation for 18 days, but not after 49 days. In another instance they were no longer viable after 10 days. Embryos within ova kept in physiological salt solution at room temperature survived during a period of a little over 12 months. Fully developed ova kept in soil outdoors under circumstances approaching natural conditions contained living embryos after a period of 8 months. From a study of a series of artificially infested chickens killed at short intervals it appears that the ova of
