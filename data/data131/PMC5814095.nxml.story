, which causes a skin disease called Buruli ulcer, a neglected emerging disease. It is the third most common mycobacterial disease after tuberculosis and leprosy. Studies have shown how mycolactone plays a pivotal role in Buruli ulcer pathogenesis, and identified it as an attractive therapeutic target. This multifunctional cytotoxin exerts multiple local and global responses, including ulcerative, analgesic, and anti-inflammatory effects. Prompted by its lipid-like structure, we used extensive multi-resolution simulations to probe mycolactone’s interactions with model membranes. Our results suggest that mycolactone is sequestered in membranes where it alters several dynamical, physical, and mechanical properties. It also behaves as a linactant, localizing at the interface between lipid domains and decreasing the inter-domain line tension. Our results shed light on how mycolactone permeates host cell membranes and is distributed between lipid and aqueous environments. These findings have significant implications for the toxin’s distribution in the host environment and mechanisms of pathogenicity. Understanding the toxin’s distribution and mechanism of trafficking will have ramifications for targeted diagnostics, therapeutic approaches, and our understanding of Buruli ulcer pathogenesis.
