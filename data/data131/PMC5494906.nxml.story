Preoperative chemoradiotherapy (CRT) followed by mesorectal excision is the standard treatment for patients with locally advanced rectal cancer (LARC). The balance between treatment efficacy and toxicity is a major issue in the clinical management of these patients. There is a requirement for the identification of predictive molecular biomarkers for the response of patients to CRT. The present study aimed to analyze the association between microRNA (miRNA/miR) expression and treatment efficacy in patients with LARC who were treated with preoperative CRT. From previous clinical trials, 55 patients for the test cohort and 130 patients for the validation cohort met the criteria for the present investigation. Through reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction analysis, the expression of miR-21, −31, −125b, −145 and −630 in the diagnostic biopsies was analyzed. The primary endpoint of tumor regression was evaluated according to Mandard's Tumor Regression Grade (TRG) system. In the test cohort, a significant association was identified between low miRNA-145 expression and TRG1+2 (P=0.0003). Similarly, this association was identified in the validation cohort, although it did not reach statistical significance. Furthermore, a significant association between high miRNA-21 expression and TRG1+2 (P=0.035) was observed in the validation cohort. The remaining miRNAs analyzed were not associated with TRG. The results of the present study highlight the clinical importance of miRNAs in LARC and underline the necessity for validation studies in this setting.
