Singlet exciton fission allows the
fast and efficient generation
of two spin triplet states from one photoexcited singlet. It has the
potential to improve organic photovoltaics, enabling efficient coupling
to the blue to ultraviolet region of the solar spectrum to capture
the energy generally lost as waste heat. However, many questions remain
about the underlying fission mechanism. The relation between intermolecular
geometry and singlet fission rate and yield is poorly understood and
remains one of the most significant barriers to the design of new
singlet fission sensitizers. Here we explore the structureâ€“property
relationship and examine the mechanism of singlet fission in aggregates
of astaxanthin, a small polyene. We isolate five distinct supramolecular
structures of astaxanthin generated through self-assembly in solution.
Each is capable of undergoing intermolecular singlet fission, with
rates of triplet generation and annihilation that can be correlated
with intermolecular coupling strength. In contrast with the conventional
model of singlet fission in linear molecules, we demonstrate that
no intermediate states are involved in the triplet formation: instead,
singlet fission occurs directly from the initial 1B
