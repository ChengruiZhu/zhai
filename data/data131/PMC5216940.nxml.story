Several studies have assessed the clinicopathological and prognostic value of cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) expression in patients with head and neck cancer (HNC), but their results remain controversial. To address this issue, a meta-analysis was carried out. A total of 29 studies involving 2430 patients were subjected to final analysis. Our results indicated that COX-2 expression was not statistically associated with advanced tumor stage (OR, 1.23; 95% CI, 0.98–1.55) but correlated with high risk of lymph node metastasis (OR, 1.28; 95% CI, 1.03–1.60) and advanced TNM stage (OR, 1.33; 95% CI, 1.06–1.66). Moreover, COX-2 expression had significant effect on poor OS (HR, 1.93; 95% CI, 1.29–2.90), RFS (HR, 2.02; 95% CI, 1.00–4.08) and DFS (HR, 5.14; 95% CI, 2.84–9.31). The results of subgroup analyses revealed that COX-2 expression was related with high possibility of lymph node metastasis in oral cancer (OR, 1.49; 95% CI, 1.01–2.20) and advanced TNM stage in oral cancer (OR, 1.58; 95% CI, 1.05–2.37) and no site-specific HNC (OR, 1.64; 95% CI, 1.02–2.62). However, subgroup analyses only showed a tendency without statistically significant association between COX-2 expression and survival. Significant heterogeneity was not found when analyzing clinicopathological data, but it appeared when considering survival data. No publication bias was detected in this study. This meta-analysis suggested that COX-2 expression could act as a prognostic factor for patients with HNC.
