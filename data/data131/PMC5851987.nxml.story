MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are known to contribute to many metabolic diseases, including diabetes. In this study, we investigated the role of miR199a-5p in the regulation of hepatic insulin sensitivity. Ad-anti-miR199a-5p adenoviruses were injected into male C57BL/6J WT mice fed a high-fat diet to inhibit miR199a-5p expression before the glucose levels and insulin resistance were assessed. Similarly, Ad-miR199a-5p adenoviruses were injected into male C57BL/6J WT mice to cause the overexpression of miR199a-5p. To investigate the roles of autophagy-related protein 14 (ATG14) and miR199a-5p in the regulation of insulin sensitivity, we injected Ad-miR199a-5p with or without Ad-ATG14 viruses into WT C57BL/6J mice before performing functional assays. Moreover, we infected HepG2 cells or primary hepatocytes with Ad-anti-miR199a-5p or Ad-miR199a-5p viruses to determine the effect of miR199a-5p on insulin resistance in vitro. Finally, we explored the clinical relevance of miR199a-5p by examining the expression level of miR199a-5p in liver samples derived from diabetes patients. We first demonstrated that knocking down miR199a-5p led to decreased glucose tolerance and clearance in vivo, whereas the overexpression of miR199a-5p had the opposite effect. We further identified ATG14 as the target of miR199a-5p, and ATG14 partially rescued miR199a-5p-potentiated glucose and insulin tolerance. In addition, transmission electron microscopy data and western blot data regarding ATG14, LC3 and BECLIN1 illustrated that miR199a-5p regulates autophagy via ATG14. Knocking down miR199a-5p in primary hepatocytes and HepG2 cells suppressed the insulin-stimulated phosphorylation of insulin receptor β, glycogen synthase kinase 3β and protein kinase B, whereas the overexpression of miR199a-5p further potentiated their phosphorylation. Finally, we detected upregulated miR199a-5p levels, which were correlated with reduced ATG14 mRNA levels and downregulated autophagy in liver samples obtained from diabetes patients. Our study uncovered a novel biological role of miR199a-5p in the regulation of hepatic insulin sensitivity via ATG14-mediated autophagy.
