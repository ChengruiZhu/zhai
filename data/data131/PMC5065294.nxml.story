Xuebijing injection (XBJ) has long been used to treat infectious diseases in China. The therapeutic effect of XBJ is probably associated with anti-inflammatory effects. However, the precise mechanisms responsible for the effects of XBJ remain unknown. The present study was conducted in order to evaluate the protective effects of XBJ in a rat model of D-galactosamine (D-Gal)- and lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced acute liver injury. In the present study, the rats were injected with D-Gal and LPS intraperitoneally to induce acute liver injury. Two hours prior to D-Gal and LPS administration, the treatment group was administered XBJ by intravenous infusion. The effects of XBJ on D-Gal- and LPS-induced expression of tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha-induced protein 8-like 2 (TIPE2), nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB), matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) and heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) as well as mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling was examined using reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR), western blot analysis, immunofluorescence, as well as by analysing the serum levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines and the transaminases, alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST). Myeloperoxidase (MPO), malondialdehyde (MDA) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) levels in the rat liver tissues were also measured. For histological analysis, hematoxylin and eosin (H&E)-stained liver samples were evaluated. The results showed that XBJ upregulated TIPE2 and HO-1 expression, reduced the expression of NF-κB65 and MMP-9, inhibited the LPS-induced gene expression of c-jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) and p38 MAPK, decreased the generation of pro-inflammatory cytokines [interleukin (IL)-6, IL-13 and TNF-α], inhibited ALT and AST activity, and ameliorated D-Gal- and LPS-induced liver injury. The histological results also demonstrated that XBJ attenuated D-Gal- and LPS-induced liver inflammation. It was found that XBJ may prevent LPS-induced pro-inflammatory gene expression through inhibiting the NF-κB and MAPK signaling pathways by upregulating TIPE2 expression, thereby attenuating LPS-induced liver injury in rats. The marked protective effects of XBJ suggest that it has the potential to be used in the treatment of LPS-induced liver injury.
