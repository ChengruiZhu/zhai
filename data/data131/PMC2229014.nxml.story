A novel, small conductance of Cl- channel was characterized by incorporation into planar bilayers from a plasma membrane preparation of lobster walking leg nerves. Under conditions of symmetrical 100 mM NaCl, 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, single Cl- channels exhibit rectifying current-voltage (I-V) behavior with a conductance of 19.2 +/- 0.8 pS at positive voltages and 15.1 +/- 1.6 pS in the voltage range of -40 to 0 mV. The channel exhibits a negligible permeability for Na+ compared with Cl- and displays the following sequence of anion permeability relative to Cl- as measured under near bi-ionic conditions: I- (2.7) greater than NO3- (1.8) greater than Br- (1.5) greater than Cl- (1.0) greater than CH3CO2- (0.18) greater than HCO3- (0.10) greater than gluconate (0.06) greater than F- (0.05). The unitary conductance saturates with increasing Cl- concentration in a Michaelis-Menten fashion with a Km of 100 mM and gamma max = 33 pS at positive voltage. The I-V curve is similar in 10 mM Tris or 10 mM HEPES buffer, but substitution of 100 mM NaCl with 100 mM tetraethylammonium chloride on the cis side results in increased rectification with a 40% reduction in current at negative voltages. The gating of the channel is weakly voltage dependent with an open-state probability of 0.23 at -75 mV and 0.64 at +75 mV. Channel gating is sensitive to cis pH with an increased opening probability observed for a pH change of 7.4 to 11 and nearly complete inhibition for a pH change of 7.4 to 6.0. The lobster Cl- channel is reversibly blocked by the anion transport inhibitors, SITS (4-acetamido, 4'-isothiocyanostilbene-2,2'-disulfonic acid) and NPPB (5- nitro-2-(3-phenylpropylamino)benzoic acid). Many of these characteristics are similar to those previously described for small conductance Cl- channels in various vertebrate cells, including epithelia. These functional comparisons suggest that this invertebrate Cl- channel is an evolutionary prototype of a widely distributed class of small conductance anion channels.
