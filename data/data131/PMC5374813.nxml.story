Regional techniques provides excellent post operative pain relief in pediatric patients. Transversus abdominis plane (TAP) block is a newer regional technique available. Though there is emerging evidence proving the efficacy of TAP blocks, there is limited literature on use of TAP catheters in pediatric patients. TAP catheters were placed in two children following laparotomy with transverse incisions and in both epidural was avoided, with good post operative pain relief. Ultrasound guidance was used in one child, while in the other the catheter was placed under direct vision after dissection of the plane between transversus abdominis and internal oblique. Intermittent boluses of high volumes of local anesthetic (0.6-0.7 ml/kg) were used through the TAP catheter, ensuring that the maximum permissible level of bupivacaine was not exceeded. In adults, continuous abdominal catheters have found a place for post-operative pain management, when epidural analgesia is contraindicated. At present, the use of TAP catheters by pediatric anesthesiologists is limited, though there exists diverse clinical scenarios when these catheters may be of benefit. Contraindication of neuraxial blockade and septic patients are the two scenarios we have reported. In conclusion, TAP catheters are effective analgesia technique for laparotomies with transverse incision in pediatric patients.
