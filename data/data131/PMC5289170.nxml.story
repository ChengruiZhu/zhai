Six patients (13%) had a single dislocation; four (9%) had recurrent dislocations. The risk of dislocation was lower in reconstructions with a dual-mobility cup (one of 24 [4%]) than in those without (nine of 23 [39%]) (hazard ratio, 0.11; 95% CI, 0.01–0.89; p = 0.038). Three patients (6%; one with a preceding structural allograft reconstruction, one with poor initial fixation as a result of an intraoperative fracture, and one with a cemented stem) had loosening and underwent revision. Infections occurred in 13 reconstructions (28%). Median duration of surgery was 6.5 hours (range, 4.0–13.6 hours) for patients with an infection and 5.3 hours (range, 2.8–9.9 hours) for those without (p = 0.060); blood loss was 2.3 L (range, 0.8–8.2 L) for patients with an infection and 1.5 L (range, 0.4–3.8 L) for those without (p = 0.039). The cumulative incidences of implant failure at 2 and 5 years were 2.1% (95% CI, 0–6.3) and 17.3% (95% CI, 0.7–33.9) for mechanical reasons and 6.4% (95% CI, 0–13.4) and 9.2% (95% CI, 0.5–17.9) for infection, respectively. Reasons for reconstruction failure were instability (n = 1 [2%]), loosening (n = 3 [6%]), and infection (n = 4 [9%]). Mean MSTS functional outcome score at followup was 70% (range, 33%–93%).
