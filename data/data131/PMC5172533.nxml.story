Neuroblastoma is a pediatric cancer that usually affects children within the first five years of life. The survival rate for the high-risk form of the disease is 40â€“50%, and patients suffering metastatic recurrences have no known curative therapeutic options. Drugs targeted to specific genetic alterations in neuroblastoma may be more effective. Although neuroblastomas generally have few actionable genetic alterations at diagnosis, targetable mutations that confer therapy resistance may be selected for over time. Here, we analyzed cancer gene panel sequencing data from 151 neuroblastomas acquired at various time points during therapy to further define how the genomic landscape of neuroblastoma evolves. We found that relapsed tumors tended to have a higher frequency of mutations potentially targetable with currently available therapies, particularly in the RAS/MAPK pathway. Our data support the concept that therapeutic decisions targeting specific oncogenic mutations should be based on sequencing data obtained as close to the intervention as possible, and not be reliant on archived diagnostic material. Prospective clinical trials will be required to determine if sequencing data obtained at the time of tumor progression can lend to improved neuroblastoma patient outcomes.
