, including drug efflux and mitotic checkpoint proteins. Human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2/ERBB2) gene amplification is associated with benefit from taxane therapy in breast cancer yet high HER2 expression also correlates with poor survival in both breast and ovarian cancer. The pre-mRNA splicing factor 4 kinase PRP4K (PRPF4B), which we identified as a component of the U5 snRNP also plays a role in regulating the spindle assembly checkpoint (SAC) in response to microtubule-targeting drugs. In this study, we found a positive correlation between PRP4K expression and HER2 status in breast and ovarian cancer patient tumors, which we determined was a direct result of PRP4K regulation by HER2 signaling. Knock-down of PRP4K expression reduced the sensitivity of breast and ovarian cancer cell lines to taxanes, and low PRP4K levels correlated with in vitro-derived and patient acquired taxane resistance in breast and ovarian cancer. Patients with high-grade serous ovarian cancer and high HER2 levels had poor overall survival; however, better survival in the low HER2 patient subgroup treated with platinum/taxane-based therapy correlated positively with PRP4K expression (HR = 0.37 [95% CI 0.15-0.88]; p = 0.03). Thus, PRP4K functions as a HER2-regulated modifier of taxane sensitivity that may have prognostic value as a marker of better overall survival in taxane-treated ovarian cancer patients.
