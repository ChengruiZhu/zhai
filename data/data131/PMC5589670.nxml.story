To explore the relationship between certain pathogens, such as chlamydia pneumonia (Cpn) and cytomegalovirus (CMV), and carotid atherosclerosis (AS) in a Chinese population.Twenty-five carotid atherosclerotic stenosis patients from the Beijing Tiantan Hospital (affiliated with Capital Medical University) participated in the study. After undergoing digital subtraction angiography (DSA) and/or computed tomography angiography (CTA), the degree of carotid artery stenosis was over 70% in all cases, and the patients underwent carotid endarterectomy. Plaque specimens were obtained during surgery. The streptavidin-peroxidase (SP) method was used to test the Cpn and CMV antigens in the specimens, and the relationship between the Cpn and CMV pathogen infections and AS was analyzed based on the test results. In the group of 25 carotid atherosclerotic specimens, the detection rate of the Cpn-specific antigens was 84.0% (21/25). In the control group, the detection rate was 13.3% (2/15) in the ascending aortic intima. Thus, the between-group difference was significant (P<0.01). The CMV-specific antigen detection rate was 72.0% (18/25) using the same experimental group specimens, and the detection rate was zero in the control group. Thus, there were significant between-group differences (P<0.01). Due to the high detection rate of Cpn- and CMV-specific antigens in carotid atherosclerotic plaque in a Chinese population, it can be inferred that pathogens such as Cpn and CMV are one factor associated with carotid atherosclerosis.
