Automatic mode switching (AMS) algorithms were designed to prevent tracking of atrial tachyarrhythmias (ATA) or other rapidly occurring signals sensed by atrial channels, thereby reducing the adverse hemodynamic and symptomatic consequences of a rapid ventricular response. The inclusion of an AMS function in most dual chamber pacemaker now provides optimal management of atrial arrhythmias and allows the benefit of atrioventricular synchrony to be extended to a population with existing atrial fibrillation. Appropriate AMS depends on several parameters: a) the programmed parameters; b) the characteristics of the arrhythmia; c) the characteristics of the AMS algorithm. Three qualifying aspects constitute an AMS algorithm: onset, AMS response, and resynchronization. Since AMS programs also provide data on the time of onset and duration of AMS episodes, AMS data may be interpreted as a surrogate marker of ATAs recurrence. Recently, stored electrograms corresponding to episodes of ATAs have been introduced, thus clarifying the accuracy of AMS in detecting ATAs Clinically this information may be used to assess the efficacy of an antiarrhythmic intervention or the risk of thromboembolic events, and it may serve as a valuable research tool  for evaluating the natural history and burden of ATAs.
