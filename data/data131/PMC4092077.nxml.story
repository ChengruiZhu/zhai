Residents’ competency-based training and multidisciplinary cooperation are needed for rapid sequence spinal anaesthesia for fetal distress. Multiple standard but ‘crash’ spinal anaesthesia for non-obstetric procedures is imperative for acquisition of experienced hands. The purpose of this review is to share our modest experiences in the use of rapid spinal anaesthesia for emergency Caesarean delivery in pregnant women complicated with fetal distress. Fetal distress diagnosis is made promtly, intravenous line put in place in labour ward. Pre-loading or not, one-touch, non-touch spinal technique prevents unnecessary delay and further fetal hypoxic injury. Spinal pack is on stand by in the operating room at all time. Preloading is possible during the waiting period for other care providers otherwise coloading is used. A single wipe of the back with chlorhexidine lotion is frequently used for scrubbing. Lidocaine infiltration or spay is essential and does not waste time but opioid as adjuvant to bupivacaine wastes a lot of time to constitute and measure. So, opioid should be avoided. Average of 2.5 ml of 0.5% hyperbaric bupivacaine is frequently used in our centres. Surgery starts almost immediately after cleaning and drapping of the patient by the obstetrician. Ephedrine is made handy and constituted in case there is hypotension which fluid alone cannot treat.
