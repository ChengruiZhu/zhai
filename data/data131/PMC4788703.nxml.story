Colloidal lipid particles such as solid lipid nanoparticles and liquid crystalline nanoparticles have great opportunities as drug carriers especially for lipophilic drugs intended for intravenous administration. In order to evaluate drug release from these nanoparticles and determine their behavior after administration, emulsion droplets were used as a lipophilic compartment to which the transfer of a model drug was measured. The detection of the model drug transferred from monoolein cubic particles and trimyristin solid lipid nanoparticles into emulsion droplets was performed using a flow cytometric technique. A higher rate and amount of porphyrin transfer from the solid lipid nanoparticles compared to the monoolein cubic particles was observed. This difference might be attributed to the formation of a highly ordered particle which leads to the expulsion of drug to the surface of the crystalline particle. Furthermore, the sponge-like structure of the monoolein cubic particles decreases the rate and amount of drug transferred. In conclusion, the flow cytometric technique is a suitable technique to study drug transfer from these carriers to large lipophilic acceptors. Monoolein cubic particles with their unique structure can be used successfully as a drug carrier with slow drug release compared with trimyristin nanoparticles.
