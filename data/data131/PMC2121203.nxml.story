Mouse and human natural killer T (NKT) cells recognize a restricted set of glycosphingolipids presented by CD1d molecules, including self iGb3 and microbial α-glycuronosylceramides. The importance of the canonical Vα14-Jα18 TCR α chain for antigen recognition by NKT cells is well recognized, but the mechanisms underlying the Vβ8, Vβ7, and Vβ2 bias in mouse have not been explored. To study the influences of thymic selection and the constraints of pairing with Vα14-Jα18, we have created a population of mature T cells expressing Vα14-Jα18 TCR α chain in CD1d-deficient mice and studied its recognition properties in vitro and in vivo. Transgenic cells expressed a diverse Vβ repertoire but their recognition of endogenous ligands and synthetic iGb3 was restricted to the same biased Vβ repertoire as expressed in natural NKT cells. In contrast, α-GalCer, a synthetic homologue of microbial α-glycuronosylceramides, was recognized by a broader set of Vβ chains, including the biased NKT set but also Vβ6, Vβ9, Vβ10, and Vβ14. These surprising findings demonstrate that, whereas Vβ8, Vβ7, and Vβ2 represent the optimal solution for recognition of endogenous ligand, many Vβ chains that are potentially useful for the recognition of foreign lipids fail to be selected in the NKT cell repertoire.
