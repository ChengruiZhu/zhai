Arthroscopic biceps tenodesis is a good choice for treating proximal lesions of the biceps tendon. However, there are few descriptions of the surgical approach. We introduce a technique for proximal biceps tenodesis using positioning portals and placing suture anchors. Our patients had a minimum of 12 months of follow-up. Between January 2010 and June 2012, a total of 49 patients (21 men, 28 women) underwent arthroscopic biceps tenodesis. The pathology was mainly associated with proximal lesions of the biceps tendon, with the diagnosis confirmed in all patients. Patients were evaluated preoperatively and then up to and including the final follow-up. Their pain and conditions were assessed using the Constant, American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons (ASES), and University of California at Los Angeles (UCLA) scores for pain; range of active forward flexion; and active range of motion. All data were analyzed statistically. All patients were operated on successfully. They achieved good healing during the follow-up (mean 14 months; range 12–34 months). Before surgery the ASES, Constant, and UCLA scores were 17.0, 39.4, and 15.4, respectively. After surgery they were 33.6, 89.1, and 31.2, respectively. The scores had significantly improved: ASES scores from 17.0 to 33.6 (
