Macrophages play a key role in atherosclerotic plaque formation and rupture. These phagocytic cells are important in the scavenging of modified lipoproteins, unwanted or dead cells and cellular debris through efferocytosis. Sirtuin1 (Sirt1), a member of the conserved sirtuin family and a key regulator in the progression of atherosclerosis exerts protective effects by regulating autophagy, a well-known survival mechanism. Inhibition of autophagy may also result in defective efferocytosis. This study aimed to investigate the effect of Sirt1 on the efferocytosis of oxidized low-density lipoprotein (ox-LDL)-induced apoptotic RAW264.7 cells through upregulation of autophagy. The apoptotic cells were incubated with high and low concentrations of Sirt1 activator resveratrol (RSV) and Sirt1 inhibitor nicotinamide (NAM) as well as autophagy inhibitor 3-methyladenine (3-MA) + low concentration RSV. Apoptosis was determined by flow cytometry (FCM) of annexin-V/propidium iodide (AV/PI) dual staining. Total proteins were extracted and protein levels were detected through western blot analysis. The ox-LDL uptake and efferocytosis of apoptotic RAW264.7 cells were detected by oil red O staining and calculation of the phagocytic index of apoptotic RAW264.7 cells. The expression of Sirt1 and autophagy marker proteins was simultaneously increased with the stimulation of low concentration RSV (all P<0.05) and decreased in low and high NAM groups (all P<0.05), compared with the control group. Efferocytosis was highest in the low concentration RSV group (P<0.001) and relatively lower in the low and high concentration NAM groups (both P<0.05) compared with the control group, which was similar to the change in the expression of Sirt1 and autophagy marker proteins. The results showed that the efferocytosis of apoptotic RAW264.7 cells was significantly improved with the upregulation of Sirt1-mediated autophagy. Therefore, Sirt1 may serve as a novel therapeutic target for the treatment of atherosclerosis.
