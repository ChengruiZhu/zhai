We study the ion density and temperature in the predipolarization and postdipolarization plasma sheets in the Earth's magnetotail using 9 years (2001–2009) of Cluster data. For our study we selected cases when Cluster observed dipolarization fronts (DFs) with an earthward plasma flow greater than 150km/s. We perform a statistical study of the temperature and density variations during the DF crossings. Earlier studies concluded that on average, the temperature increases while the density decreases across the DF. Our statistical results show a more diverse picture: While ∼54% of the DFs follow this pattern (category A), for ∼28% the temperature decreases while the density increases across the DF (category B). We found an overall decrease in thermal pressure for category A DFs with a more pronounced decrease at the DF duskside, while DFs of category B showed no clear pattern in the pressure change. Both categories are associated with earthward plasma flows but with some difference: (1) category A flows are faster than category B flows, (2) the observations indicate that category B flows are directed perpendicular to the current in the near-Earth current sheet while category A flows are tilted slightly duskward from this direction, and (3) the background
