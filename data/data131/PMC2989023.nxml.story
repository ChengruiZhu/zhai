Even in current orthopaedic practice, some cases are still not suitable candidates for hip replacement and hip fusion remains the only option in these highly selected patients. In this retrospective study we describe the long-term clinical outcome, quality of life and radiological evaluation of all adjacent joints in a cohort of 47 hip fusions. The main objective of our study was to show the long-term effects of a fusion. Thirty patients were analysed after an average of 18.2 years (range 6.2–30.5 years) with a mean SMFA of 31.2 (range 9–70). The VAS for pain for the fused hip was an average 1.9 (range 0–8), for the contralateral hip 2.0 (0–8), for the ipsilateral knee 2.0 (0–8), for the contralateral knee 1.8 (0–8) and for the lower back 3.6 (0–8). Average walking distance was 115 minutes (range 10–unlimited). Although the hip arthrodesis has lost popularity, it still is an option for the young patient with severe hip disorders, while leaving the possibility to perform a THA at a later stage. If the arthrodesis is performed with an optimal alignment of the leg, complaints from the adjacent joints are minimal, even in the long-term, and an acceptable quality of life can be obtained. We believe that in highly selected cases a hip fusion, even in current practice, is still a valid option.
