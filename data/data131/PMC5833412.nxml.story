 (UPEC). Inhibition of host cell death may allow intracellular persistence of live bacteria, while promoting host cell death causes tissue damage and releases the microbes. Both crystals and urinary tract obstruction lead to tubular cell death and kidney injury. Among the pathomechanisms, apoptosis, necroptosis, and autophagy represent key processes. With respect to malignant disorders, traditional therapeutic efforts have focused on directly promoting cancer cell death. This may exploit tumor-specific characteristics, such as targeting Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor (VEGF) signaling and mammalian Target of Rapamycin (mTOR) activity in renal cancer and inducing survival factor deprivation by targeting androgen signaling in prostate cancer. An area of intense research is the use of immune checkpoint inhibitors, aiming at unleashing the full potential of immune cells to kill cancer cells. In the future, this may be combined with additional approaches exploiting intrinsic sensitivities to specific modes of cell death such as necroptosis and ferroptosis. Here, we review the contribution of diverse cell death mechanisms to the pathogenesis of urinary tract-associated diseases as well as the potential for novel therapeutic approaches based on an improved molecular understanding of these mechanisms.
