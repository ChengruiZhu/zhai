Surgical resection of lips is a relatively rare procedure. A defective lip may cause the patient to feel socially vulnerable as well as functionally handicapped and the defect will influence the patient's self-esteem and body image. Patients with labial defects also experience speech problems along with drying and crusting of the tissues in the area of defect. The lip and cheek provide a valve mechanism for speech. Rehabilitation of patients with this type of surgery creates numerous challenges for both the surgical and the maxillofacial prosthetic teams. The goals of prosthetic treatment include regaining favorable speech and restoration of esthetics. This case report presents a 65-year-old woman who was referred for restoration of her lost lip. This case paper describes a quick and simple method of positioning magnets with lip prosthesis attached to maxillary denture and thus esthetics and speech of the patient is restored. Use of retention magnets simplify the clinical and laboratory phase retains the denture and makes it stable and comfortable for the patient. The advent of magnets has enhanced the dental practitioner's capabilities with a remarkably improved potential for increasing prosthesis stability and preserving tissue.
