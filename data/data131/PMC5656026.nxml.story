The overexpression of the oncogene human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER-2) has been associated with decreased disease-free survival and is a marker of poor prognosis of invasive breast cancer. Although the high efficacy of trastuzumab, a drug that targets the HER-2 oncogene, has been widely recognized, the efficiency of the treatment remains at ~30%. Therefore, novel effective treatments are required for patients with recurrent metastatic breast cancer. The present study aimed to investigate the effects of an engineered antibody-like molecule administered alone or in combination with trastuzumab on the tumor growth and metastasis of HER-2-positive breast cancer. Another aim was to investigate novel cancer therapies for HER-2-positive breast cancer. The engineered antibody-like molecule consists of the amino-terminal fragment (ATF) of human urokinase-type plasminogen (uPA) and is conjugated with the Fc fragment of human immunoglobulin G1 (ATF-Fc). The anti-cancer effect of ATF-Fc (alone and in combination with trastuzumab) on tumor cells and in a nude mouse tumor model was evaluated by detecting the expression of uPA, urokinase plasminogen activator receptor (uPAR) and HER-2.
