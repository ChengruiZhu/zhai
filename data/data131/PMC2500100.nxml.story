Pathological examination includes gross & microscopic examinations at different magnification. Through the steps of examination, we obtain many images that can be used for telepathology. Telepathology is the practice of pathology at a distance, viewing images on a monitor rather than directly through a light microscope. It can be used for primary diagnosis, second opinion, quality assurance and distance learning. Telepathology is classified into Static, Dynamic, Hybrid and Whole Slide Imaging (WSI). We have a successful experience in Egypt in applying the static & dynamic techniques in a pilot project between the Italian Hospital in Cairo (NPO) and the Civico Hospital in Palermo. This project began in 2003 and continued till now. From the second year 2004, Ospedale S. Giovanni e Paolo Hospital in Venice, Charing Cross Hospital in London and the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center Health System (UPMC) in the USA participated actively in our project. During the past five years we consulted on many problematic pathological cases with these different specialized pathological centers in Italy, UK & USA. In addition to the highly specialized scientific value of consulting on the cases and exchanging knowledge, we saved a lot of time and money and succeeded in providing our patients with a better medical service.
