Cellular signal transductions processes are based on protein interactions. Proteins can either associate transiently with each other or form stable complexes, and the strength of the interaction is described by the affinity (the affinity is the ratio between the rate of dissociation and association). Protein complexes with similar affinities can bind and dissociate with different rates, and these rates describe the kinetic properties of protein binding. These kinetic rates are important for signaling; however, to what extent individual changes in such rate constants are biologically important or whether the affinity is more crucial might be different in different signaling processes. In this study we analyze whether association rates are conserved during evolution, because evolutionary conservation of protein biochemical properties is usually a valuable indication of its importance. We analyzed the binding of Ras proteins to effector domains, which are central proteins in many signal transduction pathways, in different organisms. On the basis of homology modeling and energy calculations we find that association rates are conserved, although the sequence similarity decreases compared to the human protein. Our finding should encourage further analysis of the importance of kinetics for cellular signal transduction.
