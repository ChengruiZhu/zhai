A branched network of growing actin filaments, pushing against a membrane, provides the force for certain cellular movements. The Arp2/3 complex plays a central role in this process by generating new filaments and branch points. A number of proteins bind to and, in some cases, regulate Arp2/3. It is important to determine, in the cell, the precise roles of each of the many Arp2/3 regulators in generating actin networks during a complex, multistep, cellular movement. In yeast, endocytosis occurs at the plasma membrane in association with the assembly and movement of cortical actin patches, which contain six Arp2/3 regulators. We have used the actin patch as a model system to determine the specific roles of these regulators during patch assembly and movement. We used high-speed video microscopy, coupled with computer-aided particle tracking, to monitor the movement of fluorescently labeled actin patches in cells with one or more mutations of the Arp2/3 regulators. The sensitivity of this technique allowed us to identify previously unappreciated functions for Arp2/3 regulators and to assign each of the regulators a specific role during actin patch assembly and movement. Our results demonstrate that Arp2/3 regulatory proteins play overlapping roles at certain stages of actin patch movement, but distinct roles at other stages. In addition, our results provide new insight into how the assembly of an actin filament networks powers the movement of endocytic vesicles away from the membrane.
