A concept of virtual sensor array based on electrically controlled variation of affinity properties of the receptor layer is described. It was realized on the base of integrated electrochemical chemotransistor containing polyaniline as the receptor layer. Electrical control of the redox state of polyaniline was performed in five-electrode configuration containing four electrodes for conductivity measurements and one Ag/AgCl reference electrode. All the electrodes were integrated on the same glass chip. A room-temperature ionic liquid was used for the electrical connection between the reference electrode and chemosensitive material. Conductivity measurements demonstrated effective potential-controlled electrochemical conversions of the receptor material between different redox states. Binding of trimethylamine at three different potentials, corresponding to the different states of the receptor material, was studied. Concentration dependencies and binding kinetics were analyzed. The results demonstrated that the kinetic as well as the equilibrium binding properties of the receptor layer can be controlled by electrical potential, thus providing a possibility to form a virtual sensor array using only a single sensing element.
