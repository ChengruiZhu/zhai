Cellular systems are dynamic in nature, perform various biological functions and can adapt to their environment through compositional and structural remodeling. This remodeling is initiated by the binding of external ligands to receptor proteins on the cell surface or other stimuli resulting in the activation of various signaling pathways. The activation of signaling pathways in turn results in altered gene-expression which leads to changes in the molecular composition both inside and outside the cell. Thus, a thorough study of the complex interconnectivity of signaling pathways using dynamic data is necessary to understand the biological function and environmental adaptation. Protein phosphorylation is a key event in the activation of signaling pathways. We have developed an advanced computational approach to decipher the connections between different signaling pathways using time-resolved phosphoprotein data provided by the Alliance for Cellular Signaling. Important signaling events such as activation of glycogen synthase kinase 3 by protein kinase B (Akt) are captured by our reconstructed network. Novel links as well as testable hypotheses are also generated by our analysis approach.
