The class I selective inhibitor of the histone deacetylases, mocetinostat, has promising antitumor activities in both preclinical studies and the clinical trials. To understand how mocetinostat induces apoptosis, we examined the effects of mocetinostat on miR-31, a proapoptotic microRNA that was previously found to be epigenetically silenced in prostate cancer. We found that miR-31 was significantly upregulated by mocetinostat in prostate cancer cells. Antiapoptotic protein E2F6, the target of miR-31, was decreased by mocetinostat treatment. When miR-31 was blocked with an inhibitor, the ability of mocetinostat to induce apoptosis was reduced. We further demonstrated that mocetinostat enhanced the activity of docetaxel in apoptosis induction. While siRNA knockdown of E2F6 sensitized cancer cells to mocetinostat-induced apoptosis, overexpression of E2F6 blocked mocetinostat-induced apoptosis. In an orthotopic xenograft model, we demonstrated that mocetinostat activated miR-31, decreased E2F6, induced apoptosis, and significantly reduced prostate cancer growth. Importantly, we found that mocetinostat also increased miR-31 expression, decreased E2F6, and induced apoptosis in the primary prostate cancer stem cells. Thus, activation of miR-31 and downregulation of E2F6 constitute an important mechanism in mocetinostat-induced apoptosis in prostate cancer.
