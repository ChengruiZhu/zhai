Using the T cell receptor (TCR) as a sensor, T cells of the immune system constantly migrate in lymphoid organs and probe the surface of antigen-presenting cells (APCs) for foreign antigens, a sign of pathogen infection. Antigen binding by TCRs leads to T cell activation and subsequent immune response to combat the pathogens. Interestingly, although T cells respond well to antigens on APCs, they do not recognize the same antigens in solution. What is it that makes antigens on APCs recognizable? To address this, we used lipid bilayers and plastic surfaces to construct artificial APCs with defined antigen number, composition, and configuration. We found that T cells respond to very few individual foreign antigens on artificial APCs, and contrary to some current opinion, formation of antigen clusters on APCs is not required for antigen recognition by T cells. TCR triggering, however, requires T cell adhesion to the APC surface and then occurs only if the T cells are able to move. We propose that at the dynamic T cellâ€“APC interface, antigen on APCs activates T cells by applying force to the TCR and deforming its structure, which cannot be achieved by soluble antigens due to their lack of anchorage.
