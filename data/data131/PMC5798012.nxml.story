Many hip arthroscopy patients experience significant pain in the immediate postoperative period. Although peripheral nerve blocks have demonstrated efficacy in alleviating some of this pain, they come with significant costs. Local infiltration analgesia (LIA) may be a significantly cheaper and efficacious treatment modality. Although LIA has been well studied in hip and knee arthroplasty, its efficacy in hip arthroscopy is unclear. The purpose of this retrospective study is to determine the efficacy of a single extracapsular injection of bupivacaine–epinephrine during hip arthroscopy in reducing the rate of elective postoperative femoral nerve blocks. A retrospective review of 100 consecutive patients who underwent primary hip arthroscopy at a single medical center was performed. The control group consisted of 50 patients before the implementation of the current LIA protocol, whereas another 50 patients received a 20-ml extracapsular injection of 0.25% bupivacaine–epinephrine under direct arthroscopic visualization after capsular closure. In the post-anesthesia care unit (PACU), patients were offered a femoral nerve block for uncontrolled pain. The rate of femoral nerve block, and total opioid consumption, was compared between groups. The proportion of patients receiving elective femoral nerve blocks was significantly less in the LIA group (34%) as compared with the control group (56%;
