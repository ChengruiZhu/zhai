Previous studies proposed that serum uric acid (UA), an endogenous antioxidant, could be a protective factor against bone loss. However, recently, a study with a population of US adults did not note the protective effects of serum UA. Therefore, the exact association between serum UA and bone health remains unclear. We performed a retrospective consecutive cohort study in a Chinese population to examine the association between serum UA and bone health. This cross-sectional study included 17,735 individuals who underwent lumbar spine bone mineral density (BMD) measurements as part of a health examination. In covariance analyses (multivariable-adjusted), a high serum UA level was associated with a high BMD, T-score, and Z-score. In binary logistic regression analyses (multivariable-adjusted), a high serum UA level was associated with low odds ratios (ORs) for at least osteopenia and osteoporosis in male (age ≥50 years) (OR = 0.72–0.60 and OR = 0.49–0.39, respectively) and postmenopausal female participants (OR = 0.61–0.51 and OR = 0.66–0.49, respectively). In conclusion, serum UA is associated with BMD, the T-score, and the Z-score, and has a strong protective effect against at least osteopenia and osteoporosis.
