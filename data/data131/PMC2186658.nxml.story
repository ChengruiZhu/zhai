Levels of zymosan-induced arachidonic acid (20:4) metabolism by peritoneal macrophages elicited with inflammatory agents and resident macrophages were similar. Thyioglycollate (THIO)-elicited macrophages represented the exception; however, the diminished metabolism by these cells was reproduced by exposing resident cells to 5 mg/ml THIO broth in vitro. In contrast, reduced prostaglandin synthesis by macrophages from mice variously treated with the immunologic agents, Corynebacterium parvum or Bacille Calmette Guerin (BCG), closely correlated with enhanced antitoxoplasma activity, one measure of macrophage activation. This relationship, although not causative, suggested that the capacity for 20:4 metabolism is a function of the macrophage activation state. Modulation of macrophage 20:4 metabolism in vivo apparently required factors in addition to lymphocyte-derived products. Treatment of resident macrophages in vitro with BCG lymphokine was without effect on 20:4 release or prostaglandin synthesis. Activated macrophages from animals inoculated i.p. with C. parvum exhibited reduced 20:4 release and also failed to metabolize 70% of the 20:4 released in response to a zymosan stimulus. Consequently, the quantities of 20:4 metabolites formed were significantly less than expected from 20:4 release. These activated macrophages displayed greatly reduced synthesis of prostacylcin and leukotriene C compared with other 20:4 metabolites. It appeared that factors that regulate macrophage 20:4 metabolism influence the level of the inducible phospholipase and synthetic enzymes for specific 20:4 oxygenated products.
