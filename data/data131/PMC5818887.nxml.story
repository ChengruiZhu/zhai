In genetic data modeling, the use of a limited number of samples for modeling and predicting, especially well below the attribute number, is difficult due to the enormous number of genes detected by a sequencing platform. In addition, many studies commonly use machine learning methods to evaluate genetic datasets to identify potential disease-related genes and drug targets, but to the best of our knowledge, the information associated with the selected gene set was not thoroughly elucidated in previous studies. To identify a relatively stable scheme for modeling limited samples in the gene datasets and reveal the information that they contain, the present study first evaluated the performance of a series of modeling approaches for predicting clinical endpoints of cancer and later integrated the results using various voting protocols. As a result, we proposed a relatively stable scheme that used a set of methods with an ensemble algorithm. Our findings indicated that the ensemble methodologies are more reliable for predicting cancer prognoses than single machine learning algorithms as well as for gene function evaluating. The ensemble methodologies provide a more complete coverage of relevant genes, which can facilitate the exploration of cancer mechanisms and the identification of potential drug targets.
