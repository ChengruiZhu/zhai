Local measurements of the fall in oxygen pressure on stimulation of slices of the retina of the honeybee drone by flashes of light were made with oxygen microelectrodes and used to calculate the kinetics of the extra oxygen consumption (delta QO2) induced by each flash. The action spectrum for delta QO2 was obtained from response-intensity curves in response to brief (40 ms) monochromatic light flashes. The action spectrum of receptor potentials was obtained with the same experimental conditions. The two action spectra match closely: they deviate slightly from the photosensitivity spectrum of the drone rhodopsin (R). The deviation is thought to be due to wavelength- dependent light scattering and absorption in the preparation. In these experiments, the visual pigment was first illuminated with orange light, which is known to convert the bistable drone photopigment predominantly to the R state from the metarhodopsin (M) state. When long (300-900 ms) light flashes were used to elicit delta QO2, the responses to different wavelengths could not be matched in time course (as for the short flashes). Flashes producing large R-to-M conversions produced a prolonged delta QO2. The prolongation did not occur after double flashes, which produced both large R-to-M and M-to-R conversions. Similar changes in the length of afterpotentials in the photoreceptor cells and in a long-lasting decrease in photoreceptor intracellular K+ activity were found after long single or double flashes. The results are interpreted to show that the initial event for stimulation by light of metabolism in the drone retina is the same as that for stimulation of electrical responses (i.e., absorption of photons by R). Absorption of photons by M can produce an inhibitory effect on this stimulation.
