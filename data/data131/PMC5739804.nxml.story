Elevated levels of insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I) are associated with carcinogenesis and cancer progression. However, the molecular mechanisms by which IGF-I promotes prostate cancer development remain to be elucidated. Docetaxel chemotherapy is an important therapeutic strategy in many types of human cancers including prostate cancer. In this study, we showed that IGF-I rendered PC-3 and DU145 cells more resistant to docetaxel treatment. IGF-I treatment decreased miR-143 expression, but increased the expression levels of IGF-I receptor (IGF-IR) and insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS1), direct targets of miR-143. Overexpression of miR-143 abolished IGF-I-induced chemoresistance to docetaxel treatment, decreased expression levels of IGF-I, IRS1, and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) in prostate cancer cell lines. Furthermore, docetaxel treatment significantly inhibited VEGF transcriptional activation, whereas IGF-I treatment induced VEGF transcriptional activation in a dose-dependent manner. Forced expression of IGF-IR and IRS1 cDNAs without the 3â€™ UTR regions restored miR-143-inhibited VEGF transcriptional activation. Finally, miR-143 inhibited tumor growth and made cells more sensitive to docetaxel treatment for decreasing tumor growth
