Retrospective observational study on patients with surgical pathology admitted to ICU of a tertiary hospital, during 7 years, with a stay â‰¥ 5 days. The variables analyzed were age, sex, Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II (APACHE II), duration of stay, hospital and ICU mortality, original service, reason for admission, geographical place of residence, and the use of invasive techniques such as mechanical ventilation (MV), tracheotomy, and techniques of continuous renal replacement (CRR). Two groups were defined; one with intermediate stay, the one that exceeds the average of our population (> 5 days) and another with long stay patients (> 14 days). Readmissions were excluded. Firstly, the analysis of differential characteristics of patients was performed, this was according to the duration of their stay using either a contrast equal averages when the variable contrast between the two groups was quantitative or the Chi-square test when the variable analyzed was qualitative. For both tests, the existence of significant differences between groups was considered when the significance level was less than 5%. And, secondly, a model forecast ICU survival of these patients, regardless of length of stay in ICU, using a binary logistic regression analysis was performed.
