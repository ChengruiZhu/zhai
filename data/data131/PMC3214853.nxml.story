Penile growth is under androgenic control. Human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) has a stimulatory effect on testicular steroidogenesis and penile growth. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effect of hCG treatment on the gonadal response and penile growth in male idiopathic hypogonadotrophic hypogonadism (IHH) presenting with micropenis. A total of 20 IHH patients who met the criteria for micropenis were included in this study. hCG (1,500-2,000 IU) was administrated intramuscularly, 3 times per week, for 8 weeks. Basic laboratory and hormonal indexes (including serum testosterone and LH levels), penis length (flaccid and stretched), and testicular volume were measured before and 24 weeks after hCG treatment. The patients' mean age was 18.9 years (range, 12 to 24 years). The mean serum testosterone level was significantly increased after hCG treatment (baseline, 2, 4, 12, and 24 weeks: 0.90±1.35 ng/ml, 1.77±1.31 ng/ml, 3.74±2.24 ng/ml, 5.49±1.70 ng/ml, and 5.58±1.75 ng/ml, respectively; p<0.05). Mean penile length also increased significantly 24 weeks after treatment (flaccid length: from 3.39±1.03 cm to 5.14±1.39 cm; stretched length: from 5.41±1.43 cm to 7.45±1.70 cm; p<0.001). Mean testicular volumes increased significantly as well (left: from 5.45 cc to 6.83 cc; right: from 5.53 cc to 7.03 cc). There were no remarkable adverse effects of the hCG treatment. The hCG treatment increased the serum testosterone level, penile length, and testicular volume in IHH patients. Our results suggest that hCG treatment has a beneficial effect on gonadal function and penile growth in patients with IHH presenting with micropenis.
