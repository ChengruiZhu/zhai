The operative limb had higher peak adduction (-0.14° ± 7.3 vs. -6.1° ± 5.0, p=0.001) and higher peak pelvic obliquity (14.0° ±6.2 vs. 10.5° ±5.7, p=0.01) compared to the non-operative limb. While there was no significant difference in peak ground reaction force (23.2 N/kg ± 4.7 vs. 24.5 N/kg ± 4.5, p=0.15), the operative limb had lower peak knee flexion (53.3° ± 13.5 vs. 59.6° ±10.0, p=0.004), ankle dorsiflexion (14.5° ± 7.5 vs. 18.6° ± 6.5, p=0.007), and external knee flexor moment (1.4 Nm/kg ± 0.61 vs. 1.9 Nm/kg ± 0.62, p=0.002) leading to the operative limb having less power absorption at the knee (0.38 Ws/kg ± 0.31 vs. 0.58 Ws/kg ± 0.28, p=0.005). At initial contact the operative limb was more adducted (-5.0° ± 7.6 vs. -8.6° ± 3.9; p=0.02) and flexed (56.3° ± 11.4 vs. 52.5° ± 12.7; 0.06) at the hip and more flexed at the knee (21.5° ± 17.1 vs. 17.2° ± 13.6; p=0.06). The operative limb also had more pelvic elevation (8.1° ± 7.0 vs. 5.5° ± 3.8; p=0.04) and had more trunk rotation (rotation relative to the lab; -11.4° ±7.2 vs. -5.3° ±8.6; p=0.004). Eight of the 28 operative limbs had an asymmetry greater than 10% of the non-operative limb on one of the kinematic or kinetic variables; though all eight limb asymmetries occurred on different movement variables.
