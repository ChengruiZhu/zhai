In the last decade, significant progress has been made in expanding the scope and depth of publicly available immunological databases and online analysis resources, which have become an integral part of the repertoire of tools available to the scientific community for basic and applied research. Herein, we present a general overview of different resources and databases currently available. Because of our association with the Immune Epitope Database and Analysis Resource, this resource is reviewed in more detail. Our review includes aspects such as the development of formal ontologies and the type and breadth of analytical tools available to predict epitopes and analyze immune epitope data. A common feature of immunological databases is the requirement to host large amounts of data extracted from disparate sources. Accordingly, we discuss and review processes to curate the immunological literature, as well as examples of how the curated data can be used to generate a meta-analysis of the epitope knowledge currently available for diseases of worldwide concern, such as influenza and malaria. Finally, we review the impact of immunological databases, by analyzing their usage and citations, and by categorizing the type of citations. Taken together, the results highlight the growing impact and utility of immunological databases for the scientific community.
