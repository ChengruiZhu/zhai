A 21-year-old male professional Caucasian dancer presented severe instability without any pain in his right knee lasting for one year. The patient did not describe any specific traumatic event but his both knees received repeatitive direct pretibial trauma during hyperflexion of the knee while landing to the floor. At the physical examination, posterior sagging of the tibia was observed on the affected side at 90o of knee flexion and step off test and posterior drawer test were positive preoperatively under general anesthesia. The Tegner Lysholm score was evaluated as 59 (poor). A magnetic resonance image (MRI) revealed the isolated total rupture of PCL. The treatment of choice was arthroscopic single bundle reconstruction of PCL with ipsilateral autologous hamstring tendon. A standard arthroscopic exploration of the joint was performed preoperatively and we didn't observe any meniscal, cartilage or ligamentous lesion. Anteromedial and anterolateral portals were made in order to visualize the posterior cortex of the tibia with a 70 degree scope. Intra-operative fluroscopy was used to confirm proper tunnel position. During postoperatively first week, the patient was allowed to mobilize nonweight bearing with the use of two crutches without functional knee brace. Quadriceps musculature and passive range of motion was trained.
