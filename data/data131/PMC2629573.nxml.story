JC virus is a highly prevalent human polyomavirus. Infection with this virus is generally benign and asymptomatic despite viral persistence in the kidney of many people. However, in immunocompromised individuals, very rarely, the infection can progress to become a potentially deadly brain disease called Progressive Multifocal Leukoencephalopathy (PML). The discrepancy between very high viral prevalence and low incidence of PML suggests that there could be some unique viral characteristics that regulate the progression from the asymptomatic infection to the PML. Identification of such factors will help us to understand the basis of PML development and hopefully will lead to the creation of new diagnostic and treatment tools for managing PML. In this work, we demonstrate that the part of the viral surface protein that is thought to be responsible for viral interaction with cellular receptors and infection acquires specific mutations that appear to be critical for the development of PML. These mutations are found more frequently than by simple chance and therefore are thought to be “positively selected.” Based on these results, we hypothesize that the specific mutations in the viral VP1 protein that we have identified are critical for the evolution of JC virus to the version associated with PML.
