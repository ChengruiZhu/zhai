All organisms require the capability to control gene expression. In eukaryotes, transcription factors play an important role in gene regulation by recognizing specific DNA control regions associated with each gene. The DNA binding domains of transcription factors belong to evolutionarily conserved families with different protein folds. An example is the homeodomain family. Although this DNA binding domain has been studied for a long time, the properties that determine DNA binding specificity are still not clear. We previously showed in a crystal structure that the homeodomain of a transcription factor Pdx1 (Pancreatic and duodenal homeobox 1) binds DNA in 2 different conformations. In this paper, we used Molecular Dynamics simulations to show that both of these conformations are stable in solution. This is surprising since it is often assumed that proteins recognize DNA by finding a single lowest energy state. This study shows that transcription factors may bind DNA in an ensemble of conformations. This scenario may facilitate their finding the correct binding site among the 3 billion basepairs of DNA in the human genome. It may also provide flexibility in the DNA sequence that homeodomains can recognize to promote gene transcription.
