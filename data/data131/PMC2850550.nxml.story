Fluid overload, a common complication following cardiac surgery in infants is often difficult to manage. Dialysis can be used in severe cases, but may not be well tolerated. In such patients, peritoneal drainage could be an alternative option for fluid removal. We report the case of a newborn with a truncus arteriosus who developed postoperatively a complicated clinical course with right ventricular dysfunction, prerenal condition as well as fluid overload despite diuretic therapy. Dialysis was indicated for fluid removal. Peritoneal dialysis was started using a surgically placed Tenckhoff catheter and stopped due to inefficacy and leaks and no other modalities of dialysis were used. However, the catheter was left in place over a period of two months for fluid drainage and removed because of unexplained fever. In order to determine the effect of peritoneal drainage, we selected a period of one week before and one week after the removal of the drain to compare daily clinical data, urine electrolytes and renal function and found a positive effect on fluid balance control. We conclude that the fluid removal by continuous peritoneal drainage is a simple and safe alternative that can be used to control fluid balance in infants after cardiac surgery.
