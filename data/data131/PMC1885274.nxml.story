Many complex networks are naturally divided into communities or modules, where links within modules are much denser than those across modules. For example, human individuals belonging to the same ethnic groups interact more than those from different ethnic groups. Cellular functions are also organized in a highly modular manner, where each module is a discrete object composed of a group of tightly linked components and performs a relatively independent task. It is interesting to ask whether this modularity in cellular function arises from modularity in molecular interaction networks such as the transcriptional regulatory network and proteinâ€“protein interaction (PPI) network. We analyze the yeast PPI network and show that it is indeed significantly more modular than randomly rewired networks. However, we find little evidence that the structural modules correspond to functional units. We also fail to observe any evolutionary conservation among yeast, fly, and nematode PPI modules. We then show by computer simulation that modular structures can arise during network growth via a simple model of gene duplication, without natural selection for modularity. Thus, it appears that the structural modules in the PPI network may have originated as an evolutionary byproduct without much biological significance.
