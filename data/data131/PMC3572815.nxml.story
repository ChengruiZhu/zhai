In several previously reported studies, metabolic syndrome (MS) was found to be associated with colorectal adenomas. While the incidence of colorectal adenoma is growing in Korean population, there are only few studies that examined the association between MS and colorectal adenoma in Korea. The aim of this study was to investigate relationships between prevalence of colorectal adenoma and MS components. We conducted a cross sectional study using data from individuals who had undergone complete colonoscopy for health examinations at the Health Promotion Center of Korea University Medical Center from July 1, 2004 to July 31, 2010. A total of 7481 subjects (4459 males and 3022 females) were included; 1733 subjects with pathologically proven adenoma were assigned to the case group, and other 5748 subjects were assigned to the non-case group. All the participants underwent colonoscopy and received blood biochemical tests (fasting blood sugar [FBS], insulin, lipid profile, hemoglobin, blood urea nitrogen [BUN], creatinine). Univariate analysis showed that the prevalence of colorectal adenoma was higher in individuals with higher blood pressure, body mass index (BMI), total cholesterol (TC), triglyceride (TG), FBS and lower high-density lipoprotein cholesterols (HDL-C) levels, compared to those with low levels. Multiple logistic regression analysis revealed that high levels of BMI (OR 1.17, 95% CI 1.01-1.34, P trend = 0.01), TG (OR 1.27, 95% CI 1.07-1.51, P trend = 0.006), and FBS (OR 1.19 95% CI 1.01-1.40, P trend = 0.05) were significantly associated with prevalence of colorectal adenoma. Subjects with high levels of BMI, TG and FBS have increased prevalence of developing colorectal adenoma in Korea.
