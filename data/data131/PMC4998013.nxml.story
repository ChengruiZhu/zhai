Growing evidence indicates that the presence of extensive oxidative stress plays an essential role in the initiation and progression of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Amyloid-β (Aβ) aggregation is involved in the elevation of oxidative stress, contributing to mitochondrial dysfunction and lipid peroxidation. In the present study, human placenta amniotic membrane-derived mesenchymal stem cells (hAMMSCs) were intravenously injected into C57BL/6J-APP transgenic mice. hAMMSCs significantly ameliorated spatial learning and memory function, and were associated with a decreased amount of amyloid plaques of the brain. The correlation of oxidative stress with Aβ levels was lower in the hAMMSCs-injected group than in the phosphate-buffered saline (PBS)-injected group, as indicated by the increased level of antioxidative enzymes and the decreased level of lipid peroxidation product. The glutathione (GSH) level and ratio of GSH to glutathione disulfide were higher in the hAMMSC group than in the PBS group. The superoxide dismutase activity and malonaldehyde level were improved significantly as the level of Aβ decreased, but there was no such trend in the PBS group. As a result, our findings represent evidence that hAMMSC treatment might improve the pathology of AD and memory function through the regulation of oxidative stress.
