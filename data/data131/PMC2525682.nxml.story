Many enzymes have the remarkable ability to catalyze several different chemical transformations. For example, IMP dehydrogenase catalyzes both an NAD-linked redox reaction and a hydrolase reaction. These reactions utilize distinct catalytic residues and protein conformations. How did Nature construct such a complicated catalyst? While using computational methods to investigate the mechanism of the hydrolase reaction, we have discovered that IMP dehydrogenase contains two sets of catalytic residues to activate water. Importantly, the simulations are in good agreement with previous experimental observations and are further validated by subsequent experiments. Phylogenetic analysis suggests that the simpler, less efficient catalytic machinery was present in the ancestral enzyme, but was lost when the eukaryotic lineage diverged. We propose that the primordial IMP dehydrogenase utilized the less efficient machinery exclusively, and that this mechanism became obsolete when the more sophisticated catalytic machinery evolved. The presence of the less efficient machinery could facilitate adaptation, making the evolutionary challenge of the IMPDH reaction much less formidable. Thus our simulations provide an unanticipated window into the evolution of a complex enzyme.
