The ability to accurately predict values of complex phenotypes from genotype data will revolutionize plant and animal breeding, personalized medicine, and evolutionary biology. To date, genomic prediction has utilized high-density single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) genotyping arrays, but the availability of sequence data opens new frontiers for genomic prediction methods. This article is the first application of genomic phenotype prediction using whole-genome sequence data in a substantial sample of a higher eukaryote. We use ∼2.5 million SNPs with minor allele frequency greater than 2.5% derived from genomic sequences of the “Drosophila Genetic Reference Panel” to predict phenotypes for two traits, starvation resistance and startle-induced locomotor behavior. We systematically address prediction within versus across sexes, genomic best linear unbiased prediction (GBLUP) versus a Bayesian approach, and the effect of SNP density. We find that (i) genomic prediction can be efficiently implemented using sequence data via GBLUP, (ii) there is little gain in predictive ability if the number of SNPs is increased above 150,000, and (iii) neither implicit nor explicit marker selection substantially improves the predictive ability. Although the findings must be seen against the background of small sample sizes, the results illustrate both the potential of the approach and the challenges ahead.
