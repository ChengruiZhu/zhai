Gametes form through a special type of cell division called meiosis. During meiosis, two nuclear divisions take place successively; the first division is specific only to meiosis, in that homologous chromosomes segregate from each other. Homologous chromosome segregation requires physical association of the homologous chromosomes by a structure called chiasma that forms at the site of recombination. This association is thought to contribute to proper attachment of homologous chromosomes to the spindle, leading to their proper segregation. In this study, we examined the functions of chiasmata during the first division in fission yeast by analyzing chromosome dynamics and segregation in several different mutants lacking chiasmata. We found that, in addition to proper spindle attachment of homologous chromosomes, chiasmata contribute to proper spindle attachment of replicated chromosomes more substantially than previously had been thought. In addition, even when chromosomes are improperly attached to the spindle, chiasmata eventually cause proper chromosome segregation. Our findings reinforce the significance of the physical association of homologous chromosomes in proper spindle attachment of chromosomes and have unveiled a previously unidentified, chiasma-dependent mechanism that ensures proper chromosome segregation.
