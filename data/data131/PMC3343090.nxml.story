Although many diseases spread so easily between humans that someone could be infected by any of his or her daily social contacts, such is not the case for sexually transmitted diseases. Most of us have a very limited number of concurrently ongoing sexual partnerships, and thus the contact network over which sexually transmitted diseases spread tends to be very sparsely connected. The exact structure of these sexual networks plays an important role in how easy and fast sexually transmitted diseases spread through a population, and how effective various health care interventions will be. In this paper we use a simulation model to understand how the collective sexual behaviour of individuals relates to the summary measures of network structure (such as “lifetime number of partners”, and “duration of previous partnership”) that are typically used to build models of disease transmission over sexual networks. Based on our understanding of this relationship, we simulated sexual networks which have summary measures of network structure that are very similar to that of a real sexual network. Using these networks in disease transmission models will increase our ability to predict the effectiveness of health care interventions.
