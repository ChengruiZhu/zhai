Major depressive disorder and bipolar disorders are among the commonest neuropsychiatric conditions, affecting persons of both sexes which belong to all age groups. Comorbidity is the rule rather than the exception; anxiety spectrum disorders, somatoform disorders, eating disorders and substance use disorders frequently co-exist with mood disorders. Catatonia is a serious complication of the latter and every patient with a severe affective exacerbation should be assessed for the presence of catatonic signs and symptoms. In a significant minority of patients, symptoms show treatment resistance; many patients experience severe hopelessness and suicidal ideation, causing high rates of morbidity and mortality in afflicted individuals. Pharmacological management is challenging and currently available psychotropic agents often fall short of inducing remission. Second generation antipsychotics have been shown in a number of studies as having an antidepressant and mood stabilizing effect. Aripiprazole is a novel antipsychotic which is being increasingly used in difficult to treat mood disorders patients. Several controlled and uncontrolled studies have shown the efficacy and safety of this medication in subjects of all ages. Here a case series of three patients is presented who suffered from refractory mood disorders but responded to aripiprazole with complete remission of affective symptoms.
