Prostaglandin E (PGE)2 produced by osteoblasts acts as a potent stimulator of bone resorption. Inflammatory bone loss is accompanied by osteoclast formation induced by bone-resorbing cytokines, but the mechanism of PGE2 production and bone resorption in vivo is not fully understood. Using cytosolic phospholipase A2α (cPLA2α)-null mice, we examined the role of cPLA2α in PGE2 synthesis and bone resorption. In bone marrow cultures, interleukin (IL)-1 markedly stimulated PGE2 production and osteoclast formation in wild-type mice, but not in cPLA2α-null mice. Osteoblastic bone marrow stromal cells induced the expression of cyclooxygenase (COX)-2 and membrane-bound PGE2 synthase (mPGES) in response to IL-1 and lipopolysaccharide (LPS) to produce PGE2. Osteoblastic stromal cells collected from cPLA2α-null mice also induced the expression of COX-2 and mPGES by IL-1 and LPS, but could not produce PGE2 due to the lack of arachidonic acid release. LPS administration to wild-type mice reduced femoral bone mineral density by increased bone resorption. In cPLA2α-null mice, however, LPS-induced bone loss could not be observed at all. Here, we show that cPLA2α plays a key role in PGE production by osteoblasts and in osteoclastic bone resorption, and suggest a new approach to inflammatory bone disease by inhibiting cPLA2α.
