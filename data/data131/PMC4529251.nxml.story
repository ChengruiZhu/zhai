 in the 1990s revealed the presence of conserved blocks of duplicated genes, indicating an ancestral duplication of the entire genome. Subsequent work has clarified when this event occurred and what genomic rearrangements followed, but the underlying mechanistic origin of such a large-scale event remains poorly understood. Here we used a large-scale phylogenetic approach to examine the individual evolutionary histories of all yeast genes and assessed the time at which each duplication occurred. This survey revealed evidence for an ancient hybridization event between two ancestral species in the lineage in which the whole-genome duplication had occurred. We further characterize this hybridization event and the properties of the putative parental species. We propose that the whole-genome duplication was a direct consequence of this hybridization, providing a means by which the initially sterile hybrid could regain fertility. This scenario provides a mechanistic understanding of the origin of the ancient yeast whole-genome duplication and brings a radically different perspective on the interpretation of the origin and evolutionary consequences of whole-genome duplications in eukaryotic lineages.
