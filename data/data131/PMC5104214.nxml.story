The present study aimed to investigate the expression of Golgi phosphoprotein-3 (GOLPH3) protein in colon cancer tissues and the association with the prognosis of patients. In total, 98 patients with colon cancer admitted to The First Affiliated Hospital of Henan University of Science and Technology for surgery between June 2011 and June 2013 were taken as the observation group. In addition, 15 healthy individuals, determined by enteroscopy, were taken as the control group. The expressions of GOLPH3 mRNA and protein were detected by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction and immunohistochemistry, respectively. The patients were divided into GOLPH3-positive and GOLPH3-negative groups according to the expression of GOLPH3. The expression of GOLPH3 in colon cancer and its association with the prognosis of patients was analyzed. The expression of GOLPH3 mRNA and protein in colon cancer tissues was significantly increased compared with normal colon mucosa (P<0.05); among the tissues, GOLPH3 was not expressed in 29 patients and positively expressed in 69 patients. The expression of GOLPH3 was negatively associated with the tumor differentiation degree, and positively associated with tumor invasion depth, lymph node metastasis and clinical stages in GOLPH3-positive patients. The cumulative recurrence rates at 1, 2 and 3 years were significantly lower in GOLPH3-negative patients (P<0.05). The survival rates at 1, 2 and 3 years in the GOLPH3-positive group were significantly higher than that of the GOLPH3-negative patients (P<0.05). In conclusion, the positive expression of GOLPH3 mRNA and protein in colon cancer tissue was significantly increased compared with the control group. GOLPH3 expression was closely associated with the pathological features, consisting of tissue typing, clinical stage, degree of tumor invasion and lymph node metastasis, and GOLPH3 expression. Patients with GOLPH3 overexpression also had a poor prognosis.
