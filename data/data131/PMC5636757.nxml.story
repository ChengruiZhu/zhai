 anniversary of Korea Circulation Society. Between November 2005 and December 2016, more than 62,000 patients were registered from 50 primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) centers in Korea. DES in AMI may be safe and effective, however, there is concern about increased stent thrombosis after DES implantation in AMI patients, requiring longer-term dual anti-platelet therapy to reduce the risk of late stent thrombosis. Device innovation is needed to overcome issues such as stent thrombosis and restenosis by using new coating materials with biocompatible polymers, different coating methods using non-polymer techniques, bioabsorbable stents and pro-healing stents. In this review article, we describe the current usage of DES in AMI in Korea and introduce novel DES uses in development for patients with AMI. We have developed many types of DES in our research laboratory. Abciximab-coated stents inhibited platelet thrombi and restenosis. Furthermore, anti-oxidants (carvedilol, probucol and alpha-lipoic acid) were used for stent coating. Currently we are developing novel DESs using polymer-free and natural binding techniques, peptide coating stents, gene-and-drug delivery, bioabsorbable stents using 3D printing, endothelial progenitor cell capturing stents to promote reendothelialization and reduce stent thrombosis. New DESs in development may be safe and effective in preventing late stent thrombosis and restenosis in patients with AMI.
