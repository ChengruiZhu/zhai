We elucidate by computational means the processes by which the development of the mammalian embryo during its first four to five days occurs, as it is transformed from a single stem cell into hundreds of cells of different tissue types. We are interested in understanding the fundamental processes of how gene expression dynamics within each cell is coupled to the mechanical forces between cells, such that cells move to take up their positions as part of different tissues depending on the genes they express. Recent experiments which track single cell movement and division in conjunction with their gene expression dynamics suggest various hypotheses as to how this coupling functions to pattern the embryo. We have developed a computational model which can test these hypotheses. The model consists of dividing cells, interacting with each other through mechanical forces, within a confinement of embryo boundary. Each cell contains a genetic network of specific genes which influence cell adhesion properties and cell division plane directions. We explicitly simulate the formation of the trophectoderm and endoderm layers of cells which illuminates the principles by which the embryo is robustly patterned.
