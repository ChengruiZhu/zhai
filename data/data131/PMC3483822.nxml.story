Water-filtered infrared-A (wIRA) radiation has been described as supportive for tissue regeneration. We sought to investigate in detail the wIRA effect at different temperatures in 3T3 fibroblasts that were treated with glyoxal to induce formation of advanced glycation end products (AGEs). Nonirradiated and nonglyoxal-treated cells served as controls. Experiments were carried out over a range of 37°–45°C with exact temperature monitoring to distinguish between temperature and wIRA effects. Metabolic activity was assessed by resazurin assay. Mitochondrial membrane potential was assessed by JC-1 vital staining. Apoptotic changes were determined by vital staining with annexin V and YO-PRO-1 and determination of subG1 DNA content. Temperature had a dominant effect overriding effects exerted by wIRA or glyoxal treatment. The number of apoptotic cells was significantly higher at 45°C, while the percentage of healthy cells was significantly lower at 45°C. WIRA irradiation itself or in combination with glyoxal treatment exerted no damaging effects on the fibroblasts at physiological (37°–40°C) or higher (42°–45°C) temperatures compared to untreated controls. Temperatures of 45°C, which can occur during inappropriate application of infrared irradiation, damage cells even in the absence of wIRA or glyoxal application.
