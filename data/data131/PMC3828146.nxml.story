Antibiotic resistance is one of the most pressing threats on human health worldwide. Such resistance has been increasing largely due to widespread antibiotic usage. However, it has also been noticed that under certain growth limiting conditions, there is an increase in resistance frequency that is independent of the presence of antibiotics. Such increases in antibiotic resistance frequency can greatly affect the dynamics of antibiotic resistance emergence and spread. Yet currently their causes are far from understood. Many assume that we observe more resistance mutations when growth is limited, because more mutations occur under such conditions. Here we use whole genome sequencing to show that increases in resistance frequency to two different antibiotics under starvation cannot be explained by increased mutagenesis. We further show that at least some of the increase in resistance frequency is likely to be explained by natural selection that favors certain resistance mutations conferring increased fitness under starvation. These results are intriguing as they demonstrate that positive selection may contribute to increases in the frequency of certain antibiotic resistance mutations, even in the absence of selection exerted by the presence of antibiotics.
