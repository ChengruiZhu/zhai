Cytokinesis partitions a mother cell into two daughter cells at the end of each cell-division cycle. A significant amount of new plasma membrane is needed at the cleavage furrow during cytokinesis in many cell types. Membrane expansion is achieved through the balance of exocytosis and endocytosis. It is poorly understood where and when the membrane is deposited and retrieved during cytokinesis. By tracking individual vesicles with high spatiotemporal resolution and using electron microscopy, we found that new membrane is deposited relatively evenly along the cleavage furrow in fission yeast, while the rim of the division plane is the predominant site for endocytosis. The secretory vesicles/compartments carrying new membrane are mainly delivered along formin-nucleated actin cables by myosin-V motors. Surprisingly, we find that both exocytosis and endocytosis at the division site are ramped up before contractile-ring constriction and last until daughter-cell separation. We discovered that two putative vesicle tethers, the exocyst and TRAPP-II complexes, localize to different sites at the cleavage furrow to promote tethering of different, yet overlapping, classes of secretory vesicles/compartments for exocytosis and new membrane deposition.
