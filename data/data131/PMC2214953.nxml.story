It is well known that cardiac action potentials are shortened by increasing the external calcium concentration (Cao). The shortening is puzzling since Ca ions are thought to carry inward current during the plateau. We therefore studied the effects of Cao on action potentials and membrane currents in short Purkinje fiber preparations. Two factors favor the earlier repolarization. First, calcium-rich solutions generally raise the plateau voltage; in turn, the higher plateau level accelerates time- and voltage-dependent current changes which trigger repolarization. Increases in plateau height imposed by depolarizing current consistently produced shortening of the action potential. The second factor in the action of Ca ions involves iK1, the background K current (inward rectifier). Raising Cao enhances iK1 and thus favors faster repolarization. The Ca-sensitive current change was identified as an increase in iK1 by virtue of its dependence on membrane potential and Ko. A possible third factor was considered and ruled out: unlike epinephrine, calcium-rich solutions do not enhance slow outward plateau current, ikappa. These results are surprising in showing that calcium ions and epinephrine act quite differently on repolarizing currents, even though they share similar effects on the height and duration of the action potential.
