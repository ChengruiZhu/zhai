A total of 184 patients were included with 101 allocated to surgery and 73 to non-surgical treatment. Those allocated to surgery were younger (OR=0.87, P<0.0001), had a lower BMI (OR=0.83, P=0.007), less likely to be smokers (OR=0.04, P=0.002), more likely to have a known traumatic injury (OR=2.40, P=0.002), and had a lower comorbidity score (OR=0.74, P=0.096). Table 1 contains the results of all clinical outcomes measures used. At baseline the surgery group tended to be in more pain and have a higher, worse, WORC score. Both the surgical group and non-surgical group tended to improve on all outcome measures across the follow up period with the surgery group improving at a faster rate and to a greater degree after 8 or 16 weeks post baseline (see figure 1). Several variables predicted improvements across time in the surgical group including: older age, non-diabetic, shorter duration of symptoms, being male, without a known traumatic injury and a lower BMI. For the non-surgical group the following variables predicted improved outcomes across time: shorter duration of symptoms, higher baseline activity score, non-smoker, non-workerâ€™s compensation case, nonsmoker, younger in age and lower BMI. These predictors varied by outcome measure.
