Chromosomal translocations are one of the most common types of genomic rearrangements, which may have a relevant impact on cell development. They are often generated from DNA double-strand breaks that are inaccurately repaired by DNA repair machinery. In this study, we have developed genetic assays in yeast to analyze the molecular mechanisms by which these translocations can arise. We found evidence showing that the classical nonhomologous end-joining repair pathway can be a source of chromosomal translocations, with a relevant role for yeast DNA polymerase Pol4 in such processes. The involvement of Pol4 is based on its efficient gap-filling DNA synthesis activity during the joining of overhanging DNA ends with short sequence complementarity. In addition, we discovered that DNA polymerase Pol4 can be modified during the repair of the breaks via phosphorylation by Tel1 kinase. This phosphorylation seems to have important structural and functional implications in the action of Pol4, which can finally influence the formation of translocations. This work provides a useful tool for deciphering factors and mechanisms involved in DNA double-strand break repair and identifying the molecular pathways leading to chromosomal translocations in eukaryotic cells.
