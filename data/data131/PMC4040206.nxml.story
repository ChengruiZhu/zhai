To achieve tumor control for radiotherapy, a dose distribution is planned which has a good chance of sterilizing all cancer cells without causing unacceptable normal tissue complications. The aim of the present study was to achieve an accurate calculation of dose for small field dimensions and perform this by evaluating the accuracy of planning system calculation. This will be compared with real measurement of dose for the same small field dimensions using different detectors. Practical work was performed in two steps: (i) determination of the physical factors required for dose estimation measured by three ionization chambers and calculated by treatment planning system (TPS) based on the latest technical report series (IAEATRS-398) and (ii) comparison of the calculated and measured data. Our data analysis for small field is irradiated by photon energy matched with the data obtained from the ionization chambers and the treatment planning system. Radiographic films were used as an additional detector for the obtained data and showed matching with TPS calculation. It can be concluded that studied small field dimensions were averaged 6% and 4% for 6 MV and 15 MV, respectively. Radiographic film measurements showed a variation in results within ±2% than TPS calculation.
