 cells triggers the differential read-out of identical genomes. A critical interaction between two protein molecules – a protein kinase (DivL) and a response regulator (DivK) – is known to occur exclusively in one daughter cell and to thereby regulate differentiation. However, mapping the observed signaling interconnections that drive asymmetric division has been difficult to reconcile with traditional models of bacterial signaling. Here we determine how DivL detects and processes this DivK signal. Although DivL has an architecture that is typical of histidine kinases, which normally act by regulating the phosphorylation state of the appropriate response regulator, DivL's essential functions do not require kinase activity and DivL does not add or remove phosphate from DivK. Instead we find that DivL has converted its output kinase domain into an input sensor domain that specifically detects phosphorylated DivK, and we identify key features of DivL that underlie this specificity. This novel reassignment of sensory functions reverses the conventional kinase-to-response-regulator signaling flow and logically couples linear signaling pathways into complex eukaryote-like networks to regulate cell development.
