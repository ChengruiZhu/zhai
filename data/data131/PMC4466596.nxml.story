In this work we develop a neurophysiologically inspired dynamical model that is capable of solving a complex behavioral task testing cognitive stability and flexibility. We can individually fit the behavior of each of 20 human subjects that conducted this stability-flexibility task during functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). The physiological nature of our model allows us to estimate the energy consumption of the rule-representing module, which we use to predict the hemodynamic fMRI response. Through this model-based prediction, we localize the rule module to a frontoparietal network known to be required for cognitive stability and flexibility. In this way we both validate our model, which is based on noisy attractor dynamics, and specify the computational role of a cortical network that is well-established in human neuroimaging research. Additionally, we quantify the individual stability of the rule-representing states and relate this stability to individual differences in energy consumption during task switching versus distractor inhibition. Hereby we show that the activation of a thalamocorticostriatal network involved in the dopaminergic modulation of cognitive stability is modulated by the model-derived stability of the frontoparietal rule-representing network. Altogether, we show that noisy dynamic systems are likely to implement the basic computations underlying cognitive stability and flexibility.
