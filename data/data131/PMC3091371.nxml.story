The purpose of this study was to evaluate the long-term caries preventive effects of school-based fluoride mouth rinse (FMR) program in adults aged 20 years and older. 637 mothers aged from 20 to 39 years were surveyed. Clinical examinations were carried out for subjects to obtain data on dental caries prevalence when they visited local health centers to take their children for medical and dental check-ups at 1.5- or 3-years old. We also obtained information regarding the FMR program: the duration that the subjects participated between nursery school and junior high school. When analyzing data, subjects were divided into 4 groups: FMR from nursery to junior high school group (N-JH group, n=22), FMR limited to the elementary school group (El group, n=62), FMR no-experience group (n=545), and other subjects whose FMR experience is not clear (n=8). For evaluation of the FMR program effect, multiple regression analysis was used. As independent variable, the FMR program patterns were converted into dummy data, and mean DMFT was used as dependent variable. The results of multiple regression analysis between mean DMFT and FMR program patterns showed that the N-JH group and El group were negatively associated with the mean DMFT (ß=-0.20, p<0.001 for N-JH group and ß=-0.11, p=0.003 for El group).
