In spite of the evidence that the malignant transformation of gastric hyperplastic polyps (HPs) is a rare event, it must always be taken into account during diagnosis. The aim of the current study was to clarify the mechanism of the malignant transformation of gastric hyperplasia polyps, with focus on phenotypic expression, cell proliferation and p53 overexpression. Immunohistochemistry for mucin phenotypic markers, including MUC1, MUC2, MUC5AC, MUC6, tight junction factors (claudin-3, -4 and -18), an intestinal phenotypic marker [caudal type homeobox 2 (Cdx2)], Ki-67 proliferative index and p53 overexpression, was performed on archival specimens of gastric polyps excised from six patients. Histologically, the intermingled components of several lesions were present in these polyps. Furthermore, the cancer components were predominantly differentiated adenocarcinoma. Immunohistochemically, all hyperplastic components expressed MUC5AC, but did not exhibit positivity for MUC2. Additionally, the majority of hyperplastic components were immunonegative for claudin-3, while claudin-3 positivity was observed in the majority of areas of dysplasia and carcinoma. Expression of claudin-4 was also observed in the majority of cases and claudin-18 was preserved in the hyperplastic, dysplastic and adenocarcinomatous lesions of all cases. Nuclear accumulation of Cdx2 was detected in almost all the samples with dysplasia and carcinoma, while nuclear p53 was detected in 24â€“80% of the dysplastic areas and >85% of the cancer components. The Ki-67 labeling index appeared to correlate with neoplastic progression. The observations provided evidence that the mechanism underlying malignant transformation of gastric HPs may occur by multistep carcinogenesis, such as the hyperplasia-adenoma (dysplasia)-adenocarcinoma sequence, and these neoplastic cells may acquire various phenotypes during this process.
