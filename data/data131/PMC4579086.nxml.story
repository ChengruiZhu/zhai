Complex and flexible behavior likely results from the ability of groups of neurons in the brain to reconfigure dynamically the information flow across different brain areas, depending on what the brain is engaged in (processing a stimulus or carrying out a task). Here, we investigate how oscillations of cortical activity in the gamma frequency range (50â€“80 Hz) may influence dynamically the direction and strength of information flow across different groups of neurons. By recording neural activity and measuring information flow between multiple locations in visual cortex during the presentation of Hollywood movies, we found that the arrangement of the phase of gamma oscillations at different locations indicated the presence of waves propagating along the cortical tissue. These waves were observed to propagate along the direction with the maximal flow of information transmitted between neural populations. The gamma waves changed direction during presentation of different movie scenes, and when this happened, the strength of information flow in the direction of the gamma wave propagation was transiently reinforced. These findings suggest that the propagation of gamma oscillations may reconfigure dynamically the directional flow of cortical information during sensory processing.
