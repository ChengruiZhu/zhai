In the frog retinal pigment epithelium (RPE), the cellular levels of cyclic AMP (cAMP) were measured in control conditions and after treatment with substances that are known to inhibit phosphodiesterase (PDE) activity (isobutyl-1-methylxanthine, SQ65442) or stimulate adenylate cyclase activity (forskolin). The cAMP levels were elevated by a factor of 5-7 compared with the controls in PDE-treated tissues and by a factor of 18 in forskolin-treated tissues. The exogenous application of cAMP (1 mM), PDE inhibitors (0.5 mM), or forskolin (0.1 mM) all produced similar changes in epithelial electrical parameters, such as transepithelial potential (TEP) and resistance (Rt), as well as changes in active ion transport. Adding 1 mM cAMP to the solution bathing the apical membrane transiently increased the short-circuit current (SCC) and the TEP (apical side positive) and decreased Rt. Microelectrode experiments showed that the elevation in TEP is due mainly to a depolarization of the basal membrane followed by, and perhaps also accompanied by, a smaller hyperpolarization of the apical membrane. The ratio of the apical to the basolateral membrane resistance increased in the presence of cAMP, and this increase, coupled with the decrease in Rt and the basolateral membrane depolarization, is consistent with a conductance increase at the basolateral membrane. Radioactive tracer experiments showed that cAMP increased the active secretion of Na (choroid to retina) and the active absorption of K (retina to choroid). Cyclic AMP also abolished the active absorption of Cl across the RPE. In sum, elevated cellular levels of cAMP affect active and passive transport mechanisms at the apical and basolateral membranes of the bullfrog RPE.
