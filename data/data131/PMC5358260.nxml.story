An 18-year-old girl was diagnosed as “bronchiectasis” for hemoptysis and treated by using embolization intervention 19 months ago. Two months ago she was diagnosed as iron-deficiency anaemia for fatigue. Eight days ago she was diagnosed again as hypertension for headache, anxiety, frowsty, nausea, vomiting and blood pressure 180/70 mmHg. In order to know the etiology of hypertension she was sent to our hospital. Vascular murmur was heard in bilateral carotid, subclavian and the back. 4 / 6 pan systolic murmur and stronger heart sound were heard in each valve auscultation area. Bilateral radial artery pulsations were symmetrical, but bilateral femoral, popliteal and dorsal arteries of foot were weakened. The results of hemoglobin (HB), globulin, creaction protein (CRP) and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) were abnormal. Thicker wall and narrower lumen in decreasing aorta were found by aorta CTA scanning. The aorta arteritist was clearly diagnosed and treated by hormone until ESR returned to normal. Finally, artificial vascular was replaced successfully by surgery. Now the patient is fine and has already been working for a year. This case gives us the inspiration: A detailed examination to patient is very important, which avoid missed diagnosis or misdiagnosis and missed the best opportunity for treatment.
