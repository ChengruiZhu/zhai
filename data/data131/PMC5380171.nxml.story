Metformin has been proven to be one of the most safe and effective antihyperglycemic agents. Through more than six decades of metformin use, it became the most studied hypoglycemic agent; through these studies, it showed a marvelous non-glycemic related effect. These effects include modulation of different points of cancer timeline, weight reduction, cardiovascular health, thyroid diseases, polycystic ovaries disease and many other medical conditions. The aim of this review was to assess the effect of metformin on non-diabetes related medical diseases. We have examined the studies published in PubMed and summarized different randomized controlled trials, observational trials and review articles. This review has summarized most of the non-glycemic effects of metformin. Metformin has been solidly shown to be effective in weight control with certain medications, effective in neuroprotection, in endothelial health, in control of anti-HIV agent side effects and many other crucial health jeopardies. The effects in cancer timeline modulation have taken the biggest part, since it was the most studied area outside the diabetes field. Having mentioned all the above privileges, and in addition to the robust evidence in glycemic control, this consolidates the position of metformin as a first line agent in treatment of diabetes and pre-diabetes. Perhaps in the near future, we may see other indications to use metformin in non-diabetes patients.
