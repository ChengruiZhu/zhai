Solid lipid nanoparticles have been increasingly utilised for improving oral bioavailability of drugs. Simvastatin is biopharmaceutical class 2 drug with poor oral bioavailability of 5%. In the present study, simvastatin solid lipid nanoparticles were successfully prepared by hot melt emulsification process and optimised with respect to surfactant and lipid concentration, and drug loading. The nanoparticles were characterised for entrapment efficiency, particle size, morphology, crystallinity and thermal behavior. Optimised formulations prepared from solid lipids glyceryl behenate and glyceryl palmitostearate containing Tween 80 as surfactant exhibited satisfactory entrapment efficiencies above 96% and mean particle size below 200 nm. The electron micrographs indicated that lipid nanocarriers were almost spherical in appearance. X-ray diffraction and differential calorimetric studies proved that the drug was amorphised in the lipid matrix and did not crystallise out. To improve the physical as well as chemical stability of formulations, dry adsorbed nanoparticles were prepared by evaporative drying method using a carrier. The adsorbed nanoparticles demonstrated good flow properties and satisfactory reconstitution properties. Pharmacodynamic studies of simvastatin solid lipid nanoparticles revealed improved reduction in total cholesterol values as compared to pure drug powder indicating improved bioavailability.
