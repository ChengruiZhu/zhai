When HIV-1, murine leukemia virus (MLV), or other retroviruses infect a cell, the virus generates a DNA copy of the viral RNA genome and ligates the cDNA within host chromosomal DNA. This integration reaction occurs at sites throughout the host cell genome, but little is known about how integration sites are selected. We attempted to identify markers predictive of retroviral integration by comparing the genome-wide binding sites for more than 60 factors with 14 retroviral integration datasets. We borrowed Precision-Recall methods from the Information Retrieval field for extracting information from highly skewed datasets such as these. For MLV and other gammaretroviruses, strong association was observed with STAT1, acetylation of H3 and H4 at several positions, and methylation of H2AZ, H3K4, and K9. We generated a supermarker by combining high scoring markers. The supermarker localized within 2 kB of 75% of MLV proviruses and predicted the likelihood of integration within specific chromosomal regions in a cell-type specific manner. This study identified chromosomal features highly favored for retroviral integration. It also provides clues to the mechanism by which retrovirus integration sites are selected, and offers a tool for predicting cell-type specific proto-oncogene activation by retroviruses.
