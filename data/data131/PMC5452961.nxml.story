Abnormal hemostasis in cancer patients has prev iously been studied. The primary objective of the present study was to evaluate the association between preoperative hemostasis markers and clinicopathological parameters, and to identify a hemostasis marker affecting survival in patients following curative resection for colorectal cancer. A total of 170 patients who underwent curative surgery for colorectal carcinoma were evaluated. Preoperative coagulation tests included platelet, prothrombin time (PT), activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT), fibrinogen, D-dimer and fibrinogen degradation product (FDP). The clinicopathological variables, including age, gender, tumor location (rectum/colon), tumor size (≥5 cm vs. <5 cm), depth of tumor invasion, lymph node metastasis, stage, lymphovascular invasion, margin involvement and histological differentiation were analyzed. The median age of analyzed patients was 63 years (range, 28–84). The male to female ratio was 62:38. Increased levels of plasma fibrinogen, PT and platelet count (PLT) were associated with larger tumor size (P<0.001, P=0.015 and P=0.002, respectively). Increased plasma fibrinogen levels were significantly associated with depth of tumor invasion and stage (P=0.014 and P=0.048, respectively). Increased plasma D-dimer and FDP levels were significantly associated with tumor node metastasis stage (P=0.031 and P=0.002, respectively). Prolonged PT level (≥11.7 sec), hyper-fibrinogenemia (≥327 mg/dl), high D-dimer level (≥1.3 µg/ml) and increased FDP level (≥2.7 µg/ml) were the prognostic factors associated with shorter survival. Preoperative plasma fibrinogen level was significantly associated with tumor size and depth of tumor invasion. Preoperative plasma prolonged PT level, hyperfibrinogenemia, high D-dimer level and increased FDP level may function as hemostasis markers that predict overall survival in operable patients with colorectal cancer.
