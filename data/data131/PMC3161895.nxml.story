Traditionally cells in a population have been assumed to behave identically by using deterministic mathematical equations describing average cell behavior, thus ignoring its inherent randomness. A single cell stochastic model has therefore evolved in the literature to overcome this drawback. However, this single cell perspective does not account for interaction between the cell population and its environment. Since stochastic behavior leads to each cell acting differently, the cumulative impact of individual cells on their environment and consequent influence of the latter on each cell could constitute a behavior at variance. Thus in nature, cells are constantly under the influence of a highly dynamic environment which in turn is influenced by the dynamics of the cell population. A typical single cell stochastic model ignores such an interaction between the population and its environment, and uses probability distribution of a single cell to represent the entire population, which may lead to inappropriate predictions. In this study, we propose a population balance model coupled with stochastic gene regulation to demonstrate the behavior of a population in which its interactive behavior with its environment is considered. Our simulation results show that bistability is neither sufficient nor necessary for bimodal distributions in a population.
