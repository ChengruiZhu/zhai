As an important part of immune system, T cells fight infections by recognizing signs of foreign invaders. A molecule on the surface of these cells—called the T cell receptor—recognizes and binds to protein components (peptides) from bacteria, viruses, and other pathogens that are displayed on the surface of other cells. The T cells can then use this information to orchestrate the fight against infection. Vaccination involves injecting into the body foreign peptides that mimic a pathogen, therefore tricking it into raising a T cell response against that pathogen that will be protective in the event of a real infection. We studied T cell responses in mice injected with one of several peptides to which the T cell receptor binds more or less strongly. Contrary to expectations, we found that the peptide that interacted most strongly with the T cell receptor did not provoke the strongest T cell response. This may be nature's way of preventing harmful inflammatory damage due to excessively strong T cell activation. Our work shows that peptides that bind the T cell receptor with medium strength may be best to use for vaccines. Current vaccine strategies seeking to design peptides that bind with maximum strength to the T cell receptor may need to be reconsidered in light of our findings.
