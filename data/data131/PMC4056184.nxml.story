Cancer cell-derived micro-particles (MPs) play important regulatory roles on cellular and system levels. These activities are attributed in part to protein factors carried by MPs. However, recruitment strategies for sequestering certain protein factors in MPs are poorly understood. In the current study, using exogenous and endogenously expressed phospholipid-binding probes, we investigated the distribution of membrane phospholipids in MPs as a potential mechanism for electrostatically enriching cationic protein factors in MPs. We detected a significant level of externalised phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) at the outer surface of MPs. This was accompanied, in the inner leaflet of the MP membrane, by a greater density of negatively charged phospholipids, particularly phosphatidylserine (PS). The local enrichment of PS in the inner surface of MPs was correlated with an elevated presence of small GTPases in a polybasic region (PBR)-dependent fashion. By employing a series of RhoA derivatives, including constitutively active and RhoA derivatives lacking a PBR, we could demonstrate that the congregation of RhoA in MPs was dependent on the presence of the PBR. A chimer with the fusion of PBR sequence alone to GFP significantly enhanced GFP localisation in MPs, indicative of a positive contribution of electrostatic interactions in RhoA recruitment to MPs.
