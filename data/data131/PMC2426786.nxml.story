Cardiovascular disease is the major cause of mortality worldwide and accounts for approximately 40% of all deaths. Dyslipidemia is one of the primary causes of atherosclerosis and effective interventions to correct dyslipidemia should form an integral component of any strategy aimed at preventing cardiovascular disease. Fibrates have played a major role in the treatment of hyperlipidemia for more than two decades. Fenofibrate is one of the most commonly used fibrates worldwide. Since fenofibrate was first introduced in clinical practice, a major drawback has been its low bioavailability when taken under fasting conditions. Insoluble Drug Delivery-Microparticle fenofibrate is a new formulation that has an equivalent extent of absorption under fed or fasting conditions. In this review, we will discuss the clinical pharmacology of fenofibrate, with particular emphasis on this novel formulation, as well as its lipid-modulating and pleiotropic actions. We will also analyze the major trial that evaluated fibrates for primary and secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease, the safety and efficacy profile of fibrateâ€“statin combination treatment, and the current recommendations regarding the use of fibrates in clinical practice.
