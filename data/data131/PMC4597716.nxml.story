Our series involves 7 patients with 5 Schatzker type II and 2 Schatzker type III lateral tibial plateau fractures treated by a single surgeon, using a medial approach for the arthroscopic assisted fixation. There were 5 males and 2 females. The average age at the time of surgery was 34.2 years, (29-52). All of the patients underwent plain radiography and CT scanning in each knee Time from injury to surgery was 7.2 days (4-12 days). Length of follow up was 9 months (6-22 months). There was 2 lateral meniscus tear that treated with partial meniscectomy and 1 MCL injury that treated conservativeely. Surgery was performed in four steps. First step was diagnostic arthroscopy of the injured knee, , second step was reduction of the fracture using a sylindiric tube with fluoroscopic guidance, third step was the arthroscopic verification of the fracture reduction, and finally percutaneous osteosynthesis of the fracture.Care is taken to keep the flow to gravity or, if using a pressure controlled pump, to set the pressure at approximately 40 millimeters of mercury. This will help alleviate the risk of compartment syndrome. Compartment firmness should be continuously monitored throughout the procedure.
