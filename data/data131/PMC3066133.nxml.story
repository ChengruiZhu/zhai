Constant turnover of proteins is part of normal cellular physiology. Newly synthesized proteins that fail to fold are recognized by dedicated receptors and tagged for immediate degradation. The tag usually consists of a chain of a small protein, ubiquitin, and is recognized by the proteasome. We introduce a new tool to interfere with proteasomal degradation: a ubiquitin-specific protease domain (EBV-DUB) derived from Epstein-Barr Virus. This EBV-DUB, when expressed in mammalian cells, preemptively removes ubiquitin chains (deubiquitylation) and so frustrates substrate recognition and engagement by the proteasome. The natural history of misfolded, secretory proteins is poorly understood because of the strict coupling of recognition, tagging for degradation, and proteolysis. The EBV-DUB uncouples these processes and stabilizes short-lived intermediates, an activity that helped us to address the question of how such misfolded proteins are extracted from the relevant cellular compartments. Our data are consistent with the idea that unfolded substrates targeted for degradation are threaded through a narrow pore of the chaperone protein known as p97. In order to pass through the pore, the protein must first have any already attached ubiquitin chains removed; a second cycle of ubiquitylation is then required to allow engagement of the proteasome. Entry of substrate into the proteolytic chamber again requires removal of ubiquitin. We thus propose two rounds of ubiquitin attachment and removal in the course of the extraction and degradation of misfolded proteins.
