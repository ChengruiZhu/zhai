This study aimed to explore the underlying genes and pathways associated with pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) by bioinformatics analyses. Gene expression profile GSE43795 was downloaded from the Gene Expression Omnibus database. The differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between six PDAC and five non-neoplastic pancreatic tissue samples were analyzed using the limma package. Gene ontology (GO) and pathway enrichment analyses of DEGs were performed, followed by functional annotation and protein-protein interaction (PPI) network construction. Finally, the sub-network was identified and pathway enrichment analysis was performed on the contained DEGs. A total of 374 downregulated and 559 upregulated DEGs were identified. The downregulated DEGs were enriched in GO terms associated with digestion and transport and pathways related to metabolism, while the upregulated DEGs were enriched in GO terms associated with the cell cycle and mitosis and pathways associated with the occurrence of cancer including the cell cycle pathway. Following functional annotation, the oncogene pituitary tumor-transforming 1 (PTTG1) was upregulated. In the PPI network and sub-network, cell division cycle 20 (CDC20) and BUB1 mitotic checkpoint serine/threonine kinase B (BUB1B) were hub genes with high connectivity degrees. Additionally, DEGs in the sub-network including cyclin B1 (CCNB1) were mainly enriched in the cell cycle and p53 signaling pathways. In conclusion, the cell cycle and p53 signaling pathways may play significant roles in PDAC, and DEGs including CDC20, BUB1B, CCNB1 and PTTG1 may be potential targets for PDAC diagnosis and treatment.
