Renal cell carcinoma (RCC) accounts for 3% of all cancer-related mortalities in adults. The risk factors for the development of RCC remain under investigation. Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is a key mediator of angiogenesis and is crucial for the development and metastasis of tumors, including RCC. VEGF gene polymorphisms may alter VEGF protein concentrations, affect the process of angiogenesis and may be involved in inter-individual variation in carcinogenesis. In the present study, a systematic review and meta-analysis were performed based on published case-control studies in order to estimate the association between VEGF gene polymorphisms and the susceptibility to RCC. A total of five studies that involved eight polymorphisms and were published between January 2000 and December 2012 were identified from PubMed. The results of this systematic review and meta-analysis indicate that the VEGF 936C/T, 1612G/A, −1154G/A, −2549I/D, −460T/C and 405G/C gene polymorphisms are not associated with the risk of RCC. There was no polymorphism in 702C/T and RCC and the −2578C/A gene polymorphism may be associated with an increased risk of RCC. However, due to the limitations of the present study, further high quality case-control studies are warranted to confirm these findings.
