A complete understanding of how gene regulatory networks are wired in a biological system is important in many areas of biology and medicine. The most popular method for investigating a gene network has been based on experimental perturbation studies, where the expression of a gene is experimentally manipulated to observe how this perturbation affects the expressions of other genes. Such experimental methods are costly, laborious, and do not scale to a perturbation of more than two genes at a time. As an alternative, genetical genomics approach uses genetic variants as naturally-occurring perturbations of gene regulatory system and learns gene networks by decoding the perturbation effects by genetic variants, given population gene-expression and genotype data. However, since there exist millions of genetic variants in genomes that simultaneously perturb a gene network, it is not obvious how to decode the effects of such multifactorial perturbations from data. Our statistical approach overcomes this computational challenge and recovers gene networks under SNP perturbations using probabilistic graphical models. As population gene-expression and genotype datasets are routinely collected to study genetic architectures of complex diseases and phenotypes, our approach can directly leverage these existing datasets to provide a more effective way of identifying gene networks.
