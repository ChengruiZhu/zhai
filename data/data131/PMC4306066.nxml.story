Patients over 75 years old, with four or more attendances to the ED between 1 January 2010 and 31 December 2010 with at least one attendance due to chest pain, were selected from a database. Data was collected on demographic details, visit history, disposition and admission outcomes. Each patient was followed up for 12 months after the index episode via the hospital electronic registry for adverse cardiac outcome. Adverse cardiac outcomes included death from cardiac event, acute myocardial infarction (ST elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI)/non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI)) or unstable angina. A total of 158 patients with 4 or more visits to the ED accounted for 290 visits with chest pain during 2010. There is a high prevalence of coronary risk factors in this cohort (hypertension 92.4%, hyperlipidaemia 65.2%, diabetes 49.4% and smoking 26.6%). The hospital admission rate was also high at 83.5%. Over the ensuing 12 months, 8 patients died of a primary cardiac event and a further 29 patients developed 36 non-fatal cardiac events. We could not establish any significant relationship between increase in adverse cardiac outcome and individual risk factors or even two or more risk factors (
