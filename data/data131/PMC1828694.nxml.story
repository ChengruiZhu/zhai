The polygenic model of cancer susceptibility suggests that multiple alleles contribute to the excess familial risk of most common cancers. Candidate gene association studies have been a commonly used approach in the search for such alleles. We have investigated over 700 common variants in genes that are candidates for breast cancer susceptibility in a large case-control study of breast cancer, but no single variant was identified at an appropriate level of statistical significance. The purpose of this study was to consider these data as a whole, using a novel method, the admixture maximum likelihood test, to test the hypothesis that a proportion (unknown) of the variants we investigated are associated with breast cancer. After adjusting for population substructure, we found evidence for association that was robust to all but the most extreme assumptions about the degree of population stratification. Genes in the cell-cycle control and steroid hormone metabolism and signalling pathways were the main contributors. These results suggest that a proportion of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in these candidate genes are associated with breast cancer risk, but that the effects of individual SNPs are likely to be small. Large sample sizes from multicentre collaboration will be needed to identify associated SNPs with certainty.
