The genetic interval 15q11.2-q13.3 on human chromosome 15 contains several so-called “imprinted genes” which are subject to epigenetic marking leading to activity from only one parental copy. This is in contrast to non-imprinted genes, whose activity is independent of their parent-of-origin. Deletions affecting the 15q11.2-q13.3 interval cause Prader-Willi and Angelman syndromes (PWS/AS), depending on whether the deletions are paternally or maternally derived respectively. Duplications at the PWS/AS interval region may also lead to neurodevelopmental disorders, including developmental delay (DD), autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and schizophrenia (SZ). Due to presence of imprinted genes within the region, the parental origin of these duplications may be key to the pathogenicity. We show, for the first time, that paternal duplications lead to an increased risk of developing DD/ASD/multiple congenital anomalies (MCA) but, unlike maternal duplication, do not appear to increase risk for SZ. This study refines the distinct roles of maternal and paternal duplications at 15q11.2-q13.3, underlining the critical importance of maternally active imprinted genes in the contribution to the incidence of psychotic illness. This work will have tangible benefits for patients with 15q11.2-q13.3 duplications by aiding genetic counseling.
