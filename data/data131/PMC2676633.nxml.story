We studied the mechanism governing the delivery of nucleic acid-based drugs (NABD) from microparticles and nanoparticles in zero shear conditions, a situation occurring in applications such as in situ delivery to organ parenchyma. The delivery of a NABD molecule from poly(DL-lactide-co-glycolide) (PLGA) microparticles and stearic acid (SA) nanoparticles was studied using an experimental apparatus comprising a donor chamber separated from the receiver chamber by a synthetic membrane. A possible toxic effect on cell biology, as evaluated by studying cell proliferation, was also conducted for just PLGA microparticles. A mathematical model based on the hypothesis that NABD release from particles is due to particle erosion was used to interpret experimental release data. Despite zero shear conditions imposed in the donor chamber, particle erosion was the leading mechanism for NABD release from both PLGA microparticles and SA nanoparticles. PLGA microparticle erosion speed is one order of magnitude higher than that of competing to SA nanoparticles. Finally, no deleterious effects of PLGA microparticles on cell proliferation were detected. Thus, the data here reported can help optimize the delivery systems aimed at release of NABD from micro- and nanoparticles.
