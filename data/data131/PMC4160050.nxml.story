Finite element (FE) analysis has become an increasingly popular technique in the study of human joint biomechanics, as it allows for detailed analysis of the joint/tissue behavior under complex, clinically relevant loading conditions. A wide variety of modeling techniques have been utilized to model knee joint ligaments. However, the effect of a selected constitutive model to simulate the ligaments on knee kinematics remains unclear. The purpose of the current study was to determine the effect of two most common techniques utilized to model knee ligaments on joint kinematics under functional loading conditions. We hypothesized that anatomic representations of the knee ligaments with anisotropic hyperelastic properties will result in more realistic kinematics. A previously developed, extensively validated anatomic FE model of the knee developed from a healthy, young female athlete was used. FE models with 3D anatomic and simplified uniaxial representations of main knee ligaments were used to simulate four functional loading conditions. Model predictions of tibiofemoral joint kinematics were compared to experimental measures. Results demonstrated the ability of the anatomic representation of the knee ligaments (3D geometry along with anisotropic hyperelastic material) in more physiologic prediction of the human knee motion with strong correlation (
