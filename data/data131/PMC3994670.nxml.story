The mechanical properties of the light-cured composite resins are related to the material composition, but also vary according to the light-source characteristics used for polymerization. In this study we followed the compressive strength variation for a light-cured composite resin according to the time of exposure to the curing light. With that end in view,18 test pieces were made from a light-cured hybrid composite material (Filtek Z250). The test pieces where then submitted to a compressive force by a mechanical properties universal testing machine. Our results didnâ€™t show an increase of the compressive strength according to the light-curing time increasing, than only in the light-curing time limit indicated by the manufacturer. A longer light-curing time may induce a shrinkage polymerization growth with the formation of internal tensions inside the material. The composite materials light-curing in short layers as long as there is indicated by the manufacturer seems to be a safer method to make the best from a resin qualities, then an exaggerated increase of the light-curing time. The light-curing is indicated to be done in the direction of the compressive forces. To confirm this supposition other mechanical tests are also necessary
