Globins are a superfamily of widely studied and diverse globular proteins whose function is tightly related to their oxygen affinity and reactivity. Two prominent members are the well-known tetrameric hemoglobin and the monomeric myoglobin, both involved in reversible oxygen storage and transport in mammals. Truncated hemoglobins form one of the three main monophyletic branches of this superfamily, presenting an interesting paradigm for structure-function prediction studies, as a result of their well-known and conserved fold. In the present work we started from the working hypothesis that states that “it is possible to predict the function starting solely from sequence information through the determination of structure based chemical reactivity patterns related to oxygen reactivity” and predicted oxygen reactivity for over 1000 truncated hemoglobins and analyzed the results in an evolutionary context. Our results taught us many interesting and novel features of these proteins, underscoring flexibility and adaptability of the globin fold. The work also shows that it is possible to characterize protein function in greater detail if specific sequence-to-function bridges are built upon a solid structural basis.
