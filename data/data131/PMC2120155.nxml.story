We describe a novel approach to study tyrosine-phosphorylated (PY) integrins in cells transformed by virally encoded tyrosine kinases. We have synthesized a peptide (PY beta 1 peptide) that represents a portion of the cytoplasmic domain of the beta 1 integrin subunit and is phosphorylated on the tyrosine residue known to be the target of oncogenic tyrosine kinases. Antibodies prepared against the PY beta 1 peptide, after removal of cross-reacting antibodies by absorption and affinity purification, recognized the PY beta 1 peptide and the tyrosine-phosphorylated form of the intact beta 1 subunit, but did not bind the nonphosphorylated beta 1 peptide, the nonphosphorylated beta 1 subunit or other unrelated tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins. The anti- PY beta 1 antibodies labeled the podosomes of Rous sarcoma virus- transformed fibroblasts, but did not detectably stain nontransformed fibroblasts. The localization of the tyrosine phosphorylated beta 1 subunits appeared distinct from that of the beta 1 subunit. Adhesion plaques were stained by the anti-beta 1 subunit antibodies in Rous sarcoma virus-transformed fibroblasts plated on fibronectin, whereas neither podosomes nor adhesion plaques were labeled on vitronectin or on uncoated plates. Anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies labeled podosomes, adhesion plaques and cell-cell boundaries regardless of the substratum. One of the SH2 domains of the p85 subunit of phosphatidylinositol-3- kinase bound to the PY beta 1 peptide, but not to the non- phosphorylated beta 1 cytoplasmic peptide. Other SH2 domains did not bind to the PY beta 1 peptide. These results show that the phosphorylated form of the beta 1 integrin subunit is detected in a different subcellular localization than the nonphosphorylated form and suggest that the phosphorylation on tyrosine of the beta 1 subunit cytoplasmic domain may affect cellular signaling pathways.
