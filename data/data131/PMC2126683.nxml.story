. With mosquitoes infected directly from a yellow fever patient the infectivity seems to become manifest after a longer period of incubation than with those infected with the animal blood. In the former, at least 12 days are said to be necessary before they become infectious, and this hypothesis seems to be borne out by the present experiment. On the other hand, the mosquitoes which were engorged with the infected blood of the guinea pig were found to be capable of transmitting the disease within 8 days after the feeding. This discrepancy may be explained by the fact that the number of leptospira existing in experimentally infected guinea pigs is far greater than that in human blood. The frequency with which positive transmission by the stegomyia was obtained in both instances was very small indeed, in view of the number of mosquitoes employed. It appears that even under natural circumstances the percentage of mosquitoes that eventually become infected with the yellow fever microbe by sucking the blood may be very small. It has already been shown by previous investigators that to transmit yellow fever from a patient to a non-immune person requires from 0.1 to 2 cc. of blood at the height of disease. According to my estimate a female stegomyia may take up 0.01 cc. or even less. Apparently a mosquito occasionally becomes infectious by taking up the one or two organisms which happen to be circulating in the peripheral blood of man, and it is these occasionally infected few which carry the disease. It is not difficult to realize the extent of ever increasing danger from a constant supply of the microbic virus which an endemic center or an epidemic of yellow fever can provide. One infected mosquito may mean many patients, and the life of such a mosquito is usually longer than that of the persons whom it fatally infects. Finally, it is of interest to note that the development and maintenance of
