Osteochondroma and synovial chondromatosis are frequently reported benign bony and cartilaginous lesions. Osteochondroma is distinguished by a cartilage-capped bony exostosis on the exterior surface of the bone, whereas synovial chondromatosis is secondary to metaplasia and is characterized by multiple cartilaginous loose bodies within the synovium. We present an atypical case of synovial chondromatosis developing in a bursa sec­ondary to an underlying osteochondroma of the proximal medial tibia in a child. It is extremely rare to see both these conditions occurring in one location simultaneously. Moreover, this association is an unusual occurrence in the pediatric age group. The patient underwent surgical excision of the lesions and the final diagnosis was confirmed on histology. Simulation to malignant degeneration is often observed and vigilant assessment of both lesions is essential to exclude the possibility of sarcomatous transformation in those who present with these conditions since clinical, radiological, and histopathological features may overlap. However, a proper preoperative distinction may prevent an unnecessary aggressive therapeutic approach, which stood true for our case.
