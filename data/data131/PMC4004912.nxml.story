Thyroid peroxidase (TPO) abnormality is one of the causes of congenital
hypothyroidism. Two missense mutations were found as a compound heterozygous mutation in
two siblings with congenital goitrous hypothyroidism. One of these mutations, G614A
(R175Q), was a novel mutation. Characterization of the novel mutation and a cotransfection
experiment with two mutated TPO mRNAs were carried out. G614A-mRNA introduced into CHO-K1
cells expressed TPO protein with the same molecular weight as that of wild-type mRNA. The
R175Q-TPO was thought to possess enzyme activity. In terms of localization, a very small
amount of mutated TPO was expressed on the plasma membrane of CHO-K1 cells. This plasma
membrane expression of R175Q-TPO was insufficient to perform thyroid hormone synthesis,
but was markedly different from R665W-TPO. When G614A- and C2083T-mRNAs were
cotransfected, cell surface TPO-positive cells were only 13.1% in contrast to 54.4% for
wild-type mRNA. The low positivity and intensity of cell surface TPO suggested that in the
patientsâ€™ thyroids thyroid hormone synthesis was hardly performed. The congenital
hypothyroidism of the patients was thought to be a result of the mutations of the TPO gene
(G614A/C2083T).
