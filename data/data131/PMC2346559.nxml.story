Methionine is an essential amino acid that is highly toxic at elevated levels, and the liver is primarily responsible for buffering its concentration in circulation. Intracellularly, methionine is needed for the synthesis of S-adenosylmethionine (AdoMet), the major biological methylating agent. Methionine used for AdoMet synthesis can be replenished via remethylation of homocysteine. Alternatively, homocysteine can be converted to cysteine via the transsulfuration pathway. A specific feature of liver methionine metabolism is the existence of twin pathways for AdoMet synthesis and degradation. In this study, we analyzed the dependence of methionine metabolism on methionine concentration in liver cells using a combined experimental and theoretical approach. We find a sharp transition in rat hepatocyte metabolism from methionine conservation to a disposal mode with an increase in methionine concentration above its physiological range. Mathematical modeling reveals that this transition is afforded by an allosteric mechanism for switching between parallel metabolic pathways. This study demonstrates a novel mechanism of trigger behavior in biological systems by which the substrate for the metabolic network switches metabolic flux between parallel tracks for sustaining two different metabolic modes.
