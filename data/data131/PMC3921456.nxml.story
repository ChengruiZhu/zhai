Epithelial–mesenchymal transitions (EMTs) are essential manifestations of epithelial cell plasticity during tumor progression. Transforming growth factor-β(TGF-β) modulates epithelial plasticity in tumor physiological contexts by inducing EMT, which is associated with the altered expression of genes. In the present study, we used DNA micro-array analysis to search for differentially expressed genes in the TGF-β1 induced gallbladder carcinoma cell line (GBC-SD cells), as compared with normal GBC-SD cells. We identified 225 differentially expressed genes, including 144 that were over-expressed and 81 that were under-expressed in the TGF-β1 induced GBC-SD cells. NT5E (CD73) is the most increased gene, while the Fc fragment of the IgG binding protein (FcGBP) is the most decreased gene. The expression patterns of these two genes in gallbladder adenocarcinoma and chronic cholecystitis tissue were consistent with the micro-array data. Immunochemistry and clinicopathological results showed that the expression of NT5E and FcGBP in gallbladder adenocarcinoma is an independent marker for evaluation of the disease progression, clinical biological behaviors and prognosis. The data from the current study indicate that differential NT5E and FcGBP expressions could be further evaluated as biomarkers for predicting survival of patients with gallbladder cancer and that NT5E and FcGBP could be promising targets in the control of gallbladder cancer progression.
