The olfactory bulb is one of only two brain regions in which new neurons are added persistently in substantial numbers even in adult animals. This leads to an ongoing turnover of interneurons, in particular of the inhibitory granule cells, which constitute the largest cell population of the olfactory bulb. The function of this adult neurogenesis in olfactory processing is only poorly understood. Experiments show that it contributes to perceptual learning. We present a basic computational model that is built on fundamental aspects of the granule cells and their connections with the excitatory mitral cells, which convey the olfactory information to higher brain areas. We show that neurogenesis can reshape the network connectivity in response to olfactory input so as to reduce the correlations between the bulbar representations of even highly similar stimuli. The neurogenetic adaptation of the stimulus representations provides a natural explanation of the perceptual learning and the different response of young and old granule cells to novel odors that have been observed in experiments. The model makes experimentally testable predictions for training protocols that enhance the discriminability of odor mixtures.
