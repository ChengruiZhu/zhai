Cells must be able to detect and respond to changes in their surroundings. Often environmental cues, such as hormones or growth factors, are received by membrane receptors that in turn activate intracellular signaling pathways. These pathways then transmit information about the stimulus to the cellular components required to elicit an appropriate response. In many cases, the nature of the response depends on the dose of the stimulus. Thus, in addition to relaying qualitative information (e.g., the presence or absence of a stimulus), signaling pathways must also transmit quantitative information about the intensity of the stimulus. Here we introduce “dose-to-duration” encoding as an effective strategy for relaying such information. We demonstrate that by providing a mechanism for overcoming saturation effects, modulation of signal duration increases the range of stimulus concentrations for which dose-dependent responses are possible. This increased dynamic range produces the counterintuitive result of “signaling beyond saturation” in which dose-dependent responses are still possible after apparent saturation of the receptors. Finally, we demonstrate that dose-to-duration encoding is used in the yeast mating response pathway and presents a simple mechanism that can account for current experimental observations.
