Hypertensive patients usually have a higher risk of new‐onset diabetes mellitus (NOD) which may trigger cardiovascular diseases. In this study, the effectiveness of six antihypertensive agents with respect to NOD prevention in hypertensive patients was assessed. A network meta‐analysis was conducted to compare the efficacy of specific drug classes. PubMed and Embase databases were searched for relevant articles. Results of the pairwised meta‐analysis were illustrated by odd ratios (OR) and a corresponding 95% confidence interval (CI). The probabilities and outcome of each treatment were ranked and summarized using the surface under the cumulative ranking curve (SUCRA).Twenty‐three trials were identified, including 224,832 patients with an average follow‐up period of 3.9 ± 1.0 years. The network meta‐analysis showed that patients treated by angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs) were associated with a lower risk of NOD compared to placebo (PCB), calcium channel blockers (CCBs) and β‐blockers, while diuretic appeared to be ineffective for NOD prevention. Network meta‐analysis results of specific drugs showed that enalapril exhibited distinct advantages and hydrochlorothiazide also exhibited a reliable performance. Our results suggested that both ARBs and angiotensin converse enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs), especially candesartan and enalapril, were preferable for NOD prevention in hypertensive patients. Hydrochlorothiazide also exhibited a reliable performance in comparison with other agents.
