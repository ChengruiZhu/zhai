Novel cancer treatment strategies are urgently needed since currently available non-surgical methods for most solid malignancies have limited impact on survival rates. We used conditionally replicating adenoviruses as cancer-fighting agents since they are designed to target and lyse cells with specific aberrations, leaving healthy cells undamaged. Highly malignant cells, however, down-regulate the adenovirus receptor, impairing infection and subsequent cell death. We demonstrated that disruption of the MEK pathway (which is frequently activated in cancer) up-regulated this receptor, resulting in enhanced adenovirus entry. Although receptor expression was restored, disruption of signaling interfered with adenovirus replication due to cell cycle arrest, presenting an opposing trade-off. We developed a dynamical systems model to characterize the response of cancer cells to oncolytic adenovirus infection and drug treatment, providing a means to enhance therapeutic efficacy of combination treatment strategies. Our simulations predicted improved therapeutic efficacy when drug treatment and infection occurred simultaneously. We successfully validated predictions and found that a CAR-independent mechanism may be responsible for regulating adenovirus production and cell death. This work demonstrates the utility of modeling for accurate prediction and optimization of combinatorial treatment strategies, serving as a paradigm for improved design of anti-cancer combination therapies.
