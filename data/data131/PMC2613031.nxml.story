Control of gene expression is central for cell operation. Transcription regulation is a first step to control gene expression and is largely mediated by DNA-binding factors. These recruit or prevent RNA polymerase binding to promoters of specific genes. Recently, a novel way to control transcription has emerged from studying nutritional stress in bacteria. In this case, a small nucleotide effector, ppGpp, with the help of a protein DksA, interacts with the secondary channel of RNAP, affecting RNA polymerase kinetics at promoters without binding to specific DNA sequences. This interaction results in up-regulation and down-regulation of genes involved in responding to nutritional stress. This work describes TraR, a factor found on conjugative plasmids that can regulate gene expression similarly to DksA, but in the absence of any nucleotide effector, like ppGpp. Thus, regulation of transcription similarly to DksA/ppGpp may be a more general mechanism. The presence of TraR on conjugative plasmids suggests a role for TraR in pathogenicity, virulence, and antibiotic resistance. These observations should provide a basis for new studies designed to combat antibiotic resistance and virulence in emerging pathogens.
