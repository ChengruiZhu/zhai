Despite many advances in conventional treatment strategies, there is no effective treatment modality for malignant gliomas. Gene therapy may offer a promising option for gliomas and several gene therapy approaches have shown anti-tumor efficiency in previous studies. Mesenchymal stem cell-based gene therapies, in which stem cells are genetically engineered to express therapeutic molecules, have shown tremendous potential because of their innate homing ability. In this study, human menstrual blood-derived MSCs (MenSC), a novel type of multipotential MSCs displays tropism for human malignant glioma when used as a gene delivery vehicle for therapeutics. Secretable trimeric TRAIL (stTRAIL) contains the receptor-binding domain of TRAIL, a death ligand that induces apoptosis in tumor cells. To overexpress stTRAIL, MenSCs were infected with efficient adenoviral serotype 35 vectors that had no influence on its broad multipotency and low immunophenotype. The modified MenSCs served as an excellent local drug delivery system for tumor site-specific targeted delivery and demonstrated therapeutic efficacy in an animal xenografts tumor model of U-87 MG cells. The MenSC-stTRAIL cells induced antitumor effects
