Myosin Va, a member of Class V myosin, functions in organelle motility, spindle formation, nuclear morphogenesis and cell motility. The purpose of this study is to explore the expression and localization of myosin Va in testicular cancer and prostate cancer, and its specific roles in tumor progression including cell division, migration and proliferation. We detected myosin Va in testicular and prostate tumor tissues using sqRT-PCR, western blot, and immunofluorescence. Tumor samples showed an increased expression of myosin Va, abnormal actin and myosin Va distribution. Immunofluorescence images during the cell cycle showed that myosin Va tended to gather at cytoplasm during anaphase but co-localized with nucleus during other phases, suggesting the roles of myosin Va in disassembly of spindle microtubule, movement of chromosomes and normal cytokinesis. In addition, multi-nucleation and aberrant nuclear morphology were observed in myosin Va-knockdown cells. Wounding assay and CCK-8-based cell counting were conducted to explore myosin Va roles in cell migration, viability and proliferation. Our results suggest that myosin Va plays essential roles in maintaining normal mitosis, enhancing tumor cell motility and viability, and these properties are the hallmark of tumor progression and metastasis development. Therefore, an increased understanding of myosin Va expression and function will assist in the development of future oncodiagnosis and -therapy.
