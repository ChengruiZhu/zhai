Current corneal assessment technologies make the process of corneal evaluation extremely fast and simple, and several devices and technologies show signs that help in identification of different diseases thereby, helping in diagnosis, management, and follow-up of patients. The purpose of this review is to present and update readers on the evaluation of cornea and ocular surface. This first part reviews a description of slit lamp biomicroscopy (SLB), endothelial specular microscopy, confocal microscopy, and ultrasound biomicroscopy examination techniques and the second part describes the corneal topography and tomography, providing up-to-date information on the clinical recommendations of these techniques in eye care practice. Although the SLB is a traditional technique, it is of paramount importance in clinical diagnosis and compulsory when an eye test is conducted in primary or specialist eye care practice. Different techniques allow the early diagnosis of many diseases, especially when clinical signs have not yet become apparent and visible with SLB. These techniques also allow for patient follow-up in several clinical conditions or diseases, facilitating clinical decisions and improving knowledge regarding the corneal anatomy.
