. A small circular stimulus directed toward the impaled receptor produced membrane hyperpolarization. Application of a steady annular light to the receptor periphery resulted in diminution of the receptor's response to the stimulus. The effects of illumination of the surrounding receptors were isolated by directing a small, steady desensitizing light to the impaled receptor and then applying a peripheral stimulus. Brief stimuli produced a transient decrease in resistance with rapid onset and offset, a time-course similar to that of the response diminution. For some cells a depolarization that coincided with the resistance decrease was seen. During illumination with prolonged stimuli the resistance decrease was followed by a slow increase. After offset resistance rose transiently above the original value and then returned slowly to its original value. The slow resistance changes were not accompanied by changes in membrane voltage. The response diminution, resistance decrease, and depolarization were not observed in retinas treated with aspartate or hypoxia. It is therefore concluded that these effects are mediated by horizontal cells. The diminution is achieved by shunting the receptor potential and may play a role in field adaptation.
