These findings when combined with the findings of several secondary analyses suggest that, in African children, a three-dose intramuscular artesunate regimen is non-inferior to the WHO-recommended regimen for the treatment of severe malaria. The studyâ€™s open-label design may limit the accuracy of its findings, as may its use of a primary endpoint midway through drug treatment rather than at the end (the researchers note that 60% of deaths from severe malaria occur during the first 24 hours of illness and that parasitemia is harder to measure later during treatment) and its use of parasite clearance rather than death as the primary endpoint (case fatality rates in severe malaria treatment trials are very low, so a much larger study would be needed if death were used as the primary endpoint). Overall, these findings support the use of the three-dose intramuscular artesunate regimen for the treatment of severe malaria. Importantly, however, 22% of the children in the study developed delayed anemia, irrespective of treatment regimen. Thus, although further studies are needed to clarify whether treatment with artesunate or the malaria infection itself was responsible for the delayed anemia, patients treated with artesunate for severe malaria should be routinely monitored for this complication.
