Protein-protein interactions play a central role in life processes at the molecular level. The structural information on these interactions is essential for our understanding of these processes and our ability to design drugs to cure diseases. Limitations of experimental techniques to determine the structure of protein-protein complexes leave the vast majority of these complexes to be determined by computational modeling. The modeling is also important for revealing the mechanisms of the complex formation. The 3D modeling of protein complexes (protein docking) relies on the structure of the individual proteins for the prediction of their assembly. Thus the structural accuracy of the individual proteins, which often are models themselves, is critical for the docking. For the docking purposes, the accuracy of the binding sites is obviously essential, whereas the accuracy of the non-binding regions is less critical. In our study, we systematically analyze the accuracy of the binding sites in protein models produced by high-throughput techniques suitable for large-scale (e.g., genome-wide) studies. The results indicate that this accuracy is adequate for the low- to medium-resolution docking of a significant part of known protein-protein complexes.
