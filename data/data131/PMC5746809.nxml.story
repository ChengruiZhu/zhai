Leaf-cutting ants are insects that use plant material to grow fungus from which they feed. These fungus-growing ants perform various behavioral activities to establish an environment conducive to the fungus. Among these behaviors are activities that can serve to detect materials harmful to the colony, such as licking, scraping, chopping, etc. However, there are substances that may not be detected as harmful to the fungus on first contact. Cycloheximide (CHX) is one such substance, described as a fungicide that inhibits the synthesis of proteins in eukaryotes, although its mechanism of action remains unclear. The present study aimed at evaluating the behavioral changes of worker ants, time carrying orange pellets, waste deposition and mortality, when subjected to seven days of CHX-incorporated pellets and another seven days of CHX-free pellets. The fungicide adversely and structurally affected the leaf-cutter ant colonies. Their behavior went through changes, such as an increase in pellet-licking frequencies and cleaning among the ants from the third day onward. Moreover, there was an increase in time carrying orange pellets, as well as in the mortality of workers during CHX incorporation.
