Treatment of ischemic hypertensive patients with hydrochlorothiazide can precipitate cardiac arrhythmias. The present study was undertaken to evaluate the diuretic potential of green tea alone and its effects on hydrochlorothiazide in interactive groups. Rats were treated with high (500 mg/kg, p.o.) and low (100 mg/kg, p.o.) dose of green tea extract in alone and interactive groups for 30 days. Standard, high, and low dose interactive groups received hydrochlorothiazide (10 mg/kg, p.o.) on the day of experiment. Effect of different treatments was that assessed by evaluating diuretic action, diuretic activity, percentage of saline load excreted, and sodium and potassium levels in urine. Green tea in both high and low doses showed significant diuretic potential and when it is combined with hydrochlorothiazide resulted in significant improvement in the activity compared to hydrochlorothiazide alone treated group. It can be concluded that green tea extract when combined with hydrochlorothiazide showed significant increase in diuretic activity. Most important observation of the present study is even though the combination increases the diuretic potential, it is responsible for decrease in urinary potassium loss.
