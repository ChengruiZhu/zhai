During meiosis, diploid germ cells that become eggs or sperm undergo a single round of DNA replication followed by two consecutive chromosomal divisions. The segregation of chromosomes at the first meiotic division is dependent in most organisms on at least one genetic exchange, or crossover event, between chromosome homologs. Homologs that do not receive a crossover frequently undergo nondisjunction at the first meiotic division, yielding gametes that lack chromosomes or contain additional copies. Such events have been linked to human disease and infertility. Recent studies suggest that the Mlh1-Mlh3 complex is an endonuclease that resolves recombination intermediates into crossovers. Interestingly, this complex also acts as a matchmaker in DNA mismatch repair (MMR) to remove DNA replication errors. How does one complex act in two different processes? We investigated this question by performing a mutational analysis of the baker’s yeast Mlh3 protein. Five mutations were identified that disrupted MMR but not crossing over, and one mutation disrupted crossing over while maintaining MMR. Using a combination of biochemical and genetic analyses to further characterize these mutants we illustrate the importance of protein-protein interactions for Mlh1-Mlh3’s activity. Importantly, our data illustrate how defective meiotic components can alter the outcome of meiotic recombination events. They also provide new insights for the basis of infertility syndromes.
