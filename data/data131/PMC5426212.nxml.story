The purpose of this study is to investigate whether nicotinic acid (NA) and nicotinamide (NAM) reduce the Alzheimer disease (AD)-related gene expression in brain tissues of amyloid beta (Aβ)-injected mice. Male Crj:CD1 (ICR) mice were divided into 6 treatment groups; 1) control, 2) Aβ control, 3) Aβ + NA 20 mg/kg/day (NA20), 4) Aβ + NA40, 5) Aβ + NAM 200 mg/kg/day (NAM200), and 6) Aβ + NAM400. After 1-week acclimation period, the mice orally received NA or NAM once a day for a total of 7 successive days. On day 7, biotinylated Aβ42 was injected into mouse tail vein. At 5 hours after the injection, blood and tissues were collected. Aβ42 injection was confirmed by Western blot analysis of Aβ42 protein in brain tissue. NAM400 pre-treatment significantly reduced the gene expression of amyloid precursor protein and presenilin 1 in brain tissues. And, NAM200 and NAM400 pre-treatments significantly increased sirtuin 1 expression in brain tissues, which is accompanied by the decreased brain expression of nuclear factor kappa B by 2 doses of NAM. Increased expression of AD-related genes was attenuated by the NAM treatment, which suggests that NAM supplementation may be a potential preventive strategy against AD-related deleterious changes.
