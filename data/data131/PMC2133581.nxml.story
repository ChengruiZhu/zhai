 The generally held view has been that in any immune serum only a single antibody would be induced by and react with a single antigen. Were this true the various manifestations of antibody activity should show a quantitative parallelism. It has already been shown (1), however, that with antipneumococcus horse serum the mouse protective potency does not parallel the maximum amount of specifically precipitable protein except within certain well defined groups of antisera. The simplest explanation of this situation is that different horses form antibodies differing in specific protective capacity, but from our studies it seems probable that in any immune serum there may occur a mixture of antibodies which, while directed against the same antigen, possess different protective capacities, different avidities, etc. It would now appear that this latter hypothesis is the more tenable since the experiments here reported indicate the existence of antibodies of various protective potencies in horse antisera. It would not be unreasonable to hold that the antibodies of a single serum represent a series of substances with varying properties. On the basis of the present immunological fractionation experiments, the following deductions seem permissible. 1. Antipneumococcus horse sera must contain at least three, possibly many, antibody substances which react with the capsular polysaccharide. These are: (
