The objective of the present study was to investigate the application values of the intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) and the three-dimensional conformal radiation therapy (3D-CRT) in the treatment of nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC). A total of 124 patients diagnosed with nasopharyngeal carcinomas were included into the study and randomly divided into the control group and the observation group, with 62 patients in each group. The 3D-CRT combined with postoperative chemotherapy were performed on the control group and the observation group received IMRT combined with postoperative chemotherapy, and then were followed up for a median duration of 25.5 months. Comparison of the survival analysis of the two groups showed no differences between them in terms of the total effective rate and effectiveness (P>0.05), or radiotherapy complications (P>0.05). In addition, no significant differences between the two groups were found in the follow-up local tumor control probability (TCP), regional lymph node control rate, distant metastasis-free rate, tumor-free survival rate, recurrence rate and overall survival rate (P>0.05). Furthermore, there was no difference between the two groups in the overall score of quality of life (P>0.05). The present study concludes that the IMRT and the 3D-CRT have almost the same short-term and long-term clinical effects in the treatment of nasopharyngeal carcinoma and both of them have high effectiveness and safety.
