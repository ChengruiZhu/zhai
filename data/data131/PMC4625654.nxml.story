Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is a rare and devastating disease which is characterized by worsening dyspnea and exercise tolerance. These patients are often found to have concomitant, depression, anxiety and impaired health-related quality of life (HRQOL). The interrelationship of dyspnea, depression and HRQOL in these patients is not well studied. Retrospective analysis was performed on 46 PAH patients (mean age 51.73). Patients completed Medical Outcomes Study Short - Form 36 V2 (SF-36) to measure HRQOL, Modified Medical Research Council (mMRC) Dyspnea Scale and Zung Depression Scale (ZDS). Physical Health Composite Scores (PCS) and Mental Health Composite Scores (MCS) were derived from SF-36. Spearman’s correlation was computed to determine degree of correlation between pairs of scales. 46 patients (12 males, 34 females; median age 51.4 yr) with confirmed PAH were considered for the study of which 36 patients (9 males, 27 females, median age 50.1 yr), were eligible for further analysis. MMRC Dyspnea Scale Score was 1.0 (Q1 to Q3:1.0 to 2.0). Median MCS was 52.1 (Q1 to Q3:41.7 to 57.1) and PCS was 37.9 (Q1 to Q3: 30.7 to 49.6). There was a significant negative correlation between dyspnea and PCS (r =−0.660,
