Casting-type calcifications and a histopathological picture with cancer-filled duct-like structures have been presented as breast cancer with neoductgenesis. We correlated mammographic features and histopathological neoductgenesis with prognosis in a DCIS cohort with long follow-up. Mammographic features were classified into seven groups according to Tabár. Histopathological neoductgenesis was defined by concentration of ducts, lymphocyte infiltration, and periductal fibrosis. Endpoints were ipsilateral (IBE) in situ and invasive events. Casting-type calcifications and neoductgenesis were both related to high nuclear grade, ER- and PR-negativity, and HER2 overexpression but not to each other. Casting-type calcifications and neoductgenesis were both related to a nonsignificant lower risk of invasive IBE, HR 0.38 (0.13–1.08) and 0.82 (0.29–2.27), respectively, and the HR of an in situ IBE was 0.90 (0.41–1.95) and 1.60 (0.75–3.39), respectively. Casting-type calcifications could not be related to a worse prognosis in DCIS. We cannot explain why a more aggressive phenotype of DCIS did not correspond to a worse prognosis. Further studies on how the progression from in situ to invasive carcinoma is driven are needed.
