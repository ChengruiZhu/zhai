Type 2 diabetes mellitus is becoming increasingly prevalent worldwide, and has become one of the greatest threats to global health. Bariatric surgery was initially designed to achieve weight loss, and subsequently was noted to induce improvements or remission of type 2 diabetes. Currently, these bariatric operations, such as Roux‐en‐Y gastric bypass and sleeve gastrectomy, are the most effective procedures for the treatment of obesity and type 2 diabetes mellitus worldwide. However, the specific mechanism mediating the beneficial effects of metabolic surgery has remained largely unknown. Those mechanical explanations, such as restriction and malabsorption, are challenged by accumulating evidence from human and animal models of these procedures, which points to the weight‐independent factors, such as hormones, bile acids, gut microbiota, nervous system and other potential underlying mechanisms. A growing body of evidence suggests that gut microbiota are associated with the development of several metabolic disorders, and bile acids and FXR signaling are important for the metabolic benefits of bariatric surgery. Given the close relationship between bacteria and bile acids, it is reasonable to propose that microbiota–bile acid interactions play a role in the mechanisms underlying the effects of metabolic surgery.
