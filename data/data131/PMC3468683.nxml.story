Regulation of basal and induced levels of hsp70 is critical for cellular homeostasis. Ataxin-3 is a deubiquitinase with several cellular functions including transcriptional regulation and maintenance of protein homeostasis. While investigating potential roles of ataxin-3 in response to cellular stress, it appeared that ataxin-3 regulated hsp70. Basal levels of hsp70 were lower in ataxin-3 knockout (KO) mouse brain from 2 to 63Â weeks of age and hsp70 was also lower in fibroblasts from ataxin-3 KO mice. Transfecting KO cells with ataxin-3 rescued basal levels of hsp70 protein. Western blots of representative chaperones including hsp110, hsp90, hsp70, hsc70, hsp60, hsp40/hdj2, and hsp25 indicated that only hsp70 was appreciably altered in KO fibroblasts and KO mouse brain. Turnover of hsp70 protein was similar in wild-type (WT) and KO cells; however, basal hsp70 promoter reporter activity was decreased in ataxin-3 KO cells. Transfecting ataxin-3 restored hsp70 basal promoter activity in KO fibroblasts to levels of promoter activity in WT cells; however, mutations that inactivated deubiquitinase activity or the ubiquitin interacting motifs did not restore full activity to hsp70 basal promoter activity. Hsp70 protein and promoter activity were higher in WT compared to KO cells exposed to heat shock and azetidine-2-carboxylic acid, but WT and KO cells had similar levels in response to cadmium. Heat shock factor-1 had decreased levels and increased turnover in ataxin-3 KO fibroblasts. Data in this study are consistent with ataxin-3 regulating basal level of hsp70 as well as modulating hsp70 in response to a subset of cellular stresses.
