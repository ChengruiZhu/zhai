Centromeres are essential to chromatin structures, providing a binding platform for the mitotic spindle. Defects in centromere structure or function can lead to chromosome missegregation or chromosome breakage. This, in turn, can cause cancer in metazoans. Centromeres are defined by specialized chromatin that contains the histone H3 variant CENP-A (also called CenH3, or Cse4 in budding yeast), and transcription over centromeres is tightly controlled. Budding yeast centromeres are composed of a single nucleosome containing the essential Cse4. Loss of one of these specialized centromeric nucleosomes can lead to chromosome missegregation during mitosis followed by cell death. We provide evidence that energy-dependent chromatin remodeling factor Fun30 supports faithful chromosome segregation, especially when centromere structure is challenged by mutation of Cse4 or by forced transcription through centromeres, which disrupt centromere structure. We show that Fun30 binds to centromeres and that loss of Fun30 leads to various defects in centromere chromatin, suggesting a direct role for Fun30 in promoting normal centromere function. Our analysis shows that Fun30 affects nucleosome positioning at many genomic sites, including centromeres, and is required for normal occupancy of histone variant Htz1. In the absence of Fun30, we detect an increase in transcription through centromeres. We suggest that an important function of Fun30 is to limit transcription over centromeres.
