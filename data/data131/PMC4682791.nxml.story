Leaky integrate-and-fire (LIF) networks are often used to model neural network activity. The spike trains they produce, however, cannot be directly compared to the local field potentials (LFPs) that are measured by low-pass filtering the potential recorded from extracellular electrodes. This is because LFPs are generated by neurons with spatial extensions, while LIF networks typically consist of point neurons. In order to still be able to approximately predict LFPs from LIF network simulations, we here explore simple proxies for computing LFPs based on standard output from LIF network simulations. Predictions from the various LFP proxies were compared with “ground-truth” LFPs computed by means of well-established volume conduction theory where synaptic currents corresponding to the LIF network simulation were injected into populations of multi-compartmental neurons with realistic morphologies. We found that a simple weighted sum of the LIF synaptic currents with a single universally applicable set of weights excellently capture the time course of the LFP signal when the LFP predominantly is generated by a single population of pyramidal cells. Our study therefore provides a simple formula by which the LFP signal can be estimated directly from the LIF network activity, providing a missing quantitative link between simple neural models and LFP measures
