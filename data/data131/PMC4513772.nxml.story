Mean, standard deviation and range were computed for the OCP and galvanic current (I) values obtained. Results were subjected to statistical analysis through ANOVA. In Phase I, higher mean OCP was recorded in stainless steel archwire, followed by beta-titanium archwire, heat-activated nickel titanium archwire, laser-cut bracket and metal-injection molded bracket, respectively. The difference in mean OCP recorded among the groups was found to be statistically significant in aerated phosphate buffered saline solution. The galvanic current (I) for metal-injection molded stainless steel brackets showed significantly higher values than all the other materials. Phase II results suggested that, in the couples formed by the archwire-bracket-ligature combinations, the bracket had more important contribution to the total galvanic current generated, since there were significant differences between galvanic current among the 2 brackets tested but not among the 3 wires. The galvanic current of the metal-injection molded bracket was significantly higher than that of laser-cut bracket. Highest mean current (I) was recorded in metal-injection molded bracket when used with heat-activated nickel titanium archwire while lowest mean current (I) was recorded in laser-cut bracket when used with beta-titanium archwire.
