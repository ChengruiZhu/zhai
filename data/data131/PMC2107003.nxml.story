 Selective ultrastructural staining of acid mucosubstances in sites containing histochemically identifiable sulfo- and sialomucins has been obtained in fixed cryostat sections with both ferric chloride and colloidal iron solutions. The rectosigmoid region of mouse colon was fixed in glutaraldehyde, formalin, or phosphate-buffered osmium tetroxide, and 40 Âµ cryostat sections of this material were treated with 0.1 to 0.4% ferric chloride or with a solution of dialyzed ferric chloride, ammonia, and glycerin. Specific staining depended upon the pH of the iron-containing solutions, and the optimal value was found to be approximately 2.0. Specific localization of acid mucosubstances has been noted in intracellular sites, including globules within colonic goblet cells and "deep crypt" mucous cells, small vesicles of the superficial nongoblet epithelial cells, and Golgi lamellae within each of these cell types. Extracellular material, presumed to be acid mucosubstance, was found on the surface of the epithelial microvilli and on the lumenal surface of capillary endothelium. Similar material formed a reticular network surrounding stromal cells, collagen bundles, and various colonic connective tissue elements.
