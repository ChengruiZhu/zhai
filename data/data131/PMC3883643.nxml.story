Immune responses are orchestrated by a specialized cell type called dendritic cells (DCs). In order to achieve durable and robust immunity, DCs need to undergo an intricate differentiation process known as maturation. This process is poorly understood at the moment. Poly IC, which mimics viral RNA and is an agonist for the viral pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) that signal “danger” to the immune system, can induce full maturation of DCs and it has been shown that this requires type I IFN signaling. In this study we set out to examine the specific signals provided by direct PRR or IFN stimulation that are required for DC maturation. We found to our surprise that type I IFN can regulate almost all steps of the DC's maturation process without requiring direct PRR involvement. We also show that type I IFN regulates several metabolic switches essential for preservation of DC integrity: it stimulates the expression of the hypoxia-inducible factor 1α (Hif1α), which controls the metabolic shift from oxidative phosphorylation (used by resting cells to generate energy) to aerobic glycolysis, a less efficient but faster energy-producing process. This metabolic shift was required to meet increased energy demands of activated DCs and to prevent their premature death, thus sustaining an immune response to viral infection.
