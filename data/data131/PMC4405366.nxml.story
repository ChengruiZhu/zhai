Tumor suppressor p53 is the most frequently mutated protein in human cancers. Clinical studies have suggested that the type of p53 mutation can be linked to cancer prognosis, response to drug treatment, and patient survival. It is thus crucial to understand the molecular basis of p53 inactivation by various types of mutations, so as to understand the biological outcomes and assess potential cancer intervention strategies. Here, we utilize a recently developed replica exchange with guided annealing enhanced sampling technique to calculate well-converged atomistic conformational ensembles of the intrinsically disordered transactivation domain (TAD) of tumor suppressor p53 and several cancer-associated mutants in an implicit solvent protein force field. The calculated ensembles are in quantitative agreement with several types of existing NMR data on the wild-type protein and the K24N mutant. The results suggest that, while all sequences sample a similar set of conformational substates, cancer mutants could introduce both local and long-range structural modulations and in turn perturb the balance of p53 binding to various regulatory proteins and further alter how this balance is regulated by multisite phosphorylation of p53-TAD. The study also reveals important limitations in implicit solvent for simulations of disordered proteins like p53-TAD.
