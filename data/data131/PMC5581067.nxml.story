Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) have been demonstrated to play a pivotal role in proliferation and differentiation of muscles. However, the study on the roles of lncRNAs in Selenium (Se) deficiency induced muscle injury is still unclear. In this study, deep sequencing was performed to profile lncRNAs and mRNAs of the muscles from the Se deficiency (-Se group) and control (C group) chickens. The results revealed that 38 lncRNAs (23 up-regulated and 15 down-regulated) and 687 mRNAs (285 up-regulated and 402 down-regulated) were significantly dysregulated expressed, and the significantly dysregulated pathway including Phagosome, Cardiac muscle contraction, and Peroxisome Proliferator-Activated Receptor (PPAR) in -Se group. The regulatory relationship between ALDBGALG0000005049 and stearoyl-CoA desaturase (SCD), which involved in PPAR pathway was verified. The results also showed that the decreased expressions of SCD, PPARα, PPARβ and PPARγ, and the increased expressions of interleukin (IL)-1β, IL-6, IL-8, and chemokine (C-C motif) ligand 4 (CCL4) along with silencing of ALDBGALG0000005049 in chicken myoblasts. Moreover, increased expressions of IL-1β, IL-6, IL-8, and CCL4 and inflammatory cell infiltration in microstructure of chicken muscles treated with Se deficiency were observed. This study displayed an overview of aberrantly expressed lncRNAs and mRNAs profiles and PPAR pathway, and revealed that downregulation of ALDBGALG0000005049 caused inflammation by regulating SCD in chicken muscle resulted from Se deficiency.
