Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is associated with increased cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Microvascular function has been linked to several risk factors for cardiovascular disease and may be affected in RA. It is, however, presently unknown at what point in the disease course the abnormalities in microvascular function occur. We determined whether microvascular function is already disturbed in early disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARD)-naive RA patients with low systemic inflammation. Fifteen consecutive RA patients with a median symptom duration of 5 months, a C-reactive protein level of ≤20 mg/l and without a history of cardiovascular disease, and age 15 and sex-matched healthy controls were recruited. Endothelium-dependent and endothelium-independent vasodilatation in skin was evaluated with laser Doppler fluxmetry after iontophoresis of acetylcholine and sodium nitroprusside, respectively. Videomicroscopy was used to measure recruitment of skin capillaries after arterial occlusion. CRP and ESR levels were mildly, but significantly elevated in patients compared to controls. No differences in both endothelium-dependent vasodilatation and capillary recruitment were observed between groups [709% (95% CI, 457–961%) vs 797% (95% CI, 556–1,037%),
