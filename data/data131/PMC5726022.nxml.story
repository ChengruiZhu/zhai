Extraskeletal chondrosarcoma of the leg is a rare, malignant neoplasm with very few cases having been reported in the literature. In this study we investigate the possibility of using intensity modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) for this type of disease and demonstrate its advantages over conventional three‐dimensional (3D) conformal treatment. A case was presented of a patient with extraskeletal chondrosarcoma of the lateral compartment of the leg in which the target volume was 50 cm in length and twisted around the surrounding bones. Both the 3D conformal plan and IMRT plan were designed using the Memorial Sloan‐Kettering Cancer Center planning system. The IMRT plan produced a superior dose distribution to the patient as compared to the 3D conformal plan both in terms of dose conformity and homogeneity in the target volumes, and reduction of the maximum dose to the bone. The planning time of the IMRT plan was about 3–5 times shorter than that of the 3D conformal plan. It was demonstrated that the IMRT technique can be used not just for small tumors, but also for large and spiral‐shaped tumors close to critical organs. The IMRT method requires less planning time, and provides better target coverage with more sparing of critical structures. When planning patients with multiple target volumes receiving different prescribed doses, the IMRT technique can more easily meet this requirement.
