Meiosis is central to the life cycle of sexually reproducing organisms. The first round of division (meiosis I) is unique to meiosis in that homologous chromosomes are segregated to opposite poles. The tight association between homologous chromosomes is essential for their faithful segregation. To establish such association, meiosis employs a unique, homologous recombination-dependent mechanism that facilitates the recognition, association, and reciprocal exchange of DNA strands of homologous chromosomes, thus providing physical connections between homologous chromosomes. All these events take place in the context of an intricate structure called the synaptonemal complex (SC). Within this complex, the axis of one chromosome is aligned at close proximity with the axis of its homologue. This alignment stretches along the entire length of the chromosome pair, with zipper-like structures, called transverse filaments, holding axes together. In this work, we identified the Ecm11-Gmc2 complex as a novel component of the SC, promoting the assembly of transverse filaments. Importantly, we demonstrate that post-translational modification of Ecm11 with SUMO (small ubiquitin-like modifier) is critical for ensuring the chromosomal loading of transverse filaments. Thus, our work provides a molecular basis for how homologous chromosomes become tightly associated during meiotic prophase.
