Human endogenous retroviruses (HERVs) are genomic “fossils” of ancient exogenous retroviruses and their descendants that were replicated in host germ cells. The traits and evolutionary dynamics of ancient retroviruses and their descendants can be inferred by scrutinizing present-day HERVs. We systematically identified regulatory elements of HERVs based on publicly available datasets of ChIP-Seq of 97 TFs. Clustering analysis showed that HERV/LTRs can be grouped by the TF-binding patterns; HERV/LTR groups bounded by pluripotent TFs (e.g., SOX2, POU5F1, and NANOG), embryonic endoderm/mesendoderm TFs (e.g., GATA4/6, SOX17, and FOXA1/2), and hematopoietic TFs (e.g., SPI1 (PU1), GATA1/2, and TAL1) were identified. By analyzing the three-dimensional chromosomal interactions, we demonstrated that regulatory elements of HERVs tend to interact with host immune-response genes. We further demonstrated heterogeneities of regulatory elements within LTR7; SOX2, POU5F1, and KLF4-binding sites were highly enriched in the youngest subgroup of LTR7, which had the highest transcriptional activity in pluripotent cells. This suggests that the subgroup acquired those regulatory activities for efficient replication in the host germ cells. Finally, we constructed dbHERV-REs, an interactive database of HERV/LTR regulatory elements (
