Human metastasis-associated lung adenocarcinoma transcript 1 (MALAT1) is a newly identified metastasis-associated long non-coding RNA. In a previous study, it was identified that plasma levels of MALAT1 were significantly increased in gastric cancer patients with metastasis compared with gastric cancer patients without metastasis and healthy control individuals. However, it is unclear whether plasma levels of MALAT1 may act as a biomarker for evaluating the development of metastasis in epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC). In the present study, groups that consisted of 47 patients with EOC and metastasis (EOC/DM), 47 patients with EOC without metastasis (EOC/NDM), and 47 healthy control (HC) individuals were established. Reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) was used to detect the level of plasma MALAT1 in these groups. The results showed that levels of plasma MALAT1 were significantly increased in the EOC/DM group compared with the EOC/NDM and HC groups (P<0.001). Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis indicated that plasma MALAT1 yielded an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.820 [95% confidence interval (CI), 0.734–0.905; P<0.001], distinguishing between EOC/DM and EOC/NDM. ROC analysis also yielded an AUC of 0.884 (95% CI, 0.820–0.949; P<0.001), with 89.4% sensitivity and 72.3% specificity for distinguishing between EOC/DM and HC. Furthermore, multivariate analysis indicated that overexpression of MALAT1, differentiation (poor), tumor-node-metastasis stage (IV), lymph node metastasis (N3), peritoneal invasion (present) and higher serum carbohydrate antigen 125 levels were independent predictors of survival (hazard ratio, 3.322; P=0.028) in patients with EOC. Kaplan-Meier analysis revealed that patients with increased MALAT1 expression had a poorer disease-free survival time. In conclusion, the levels of plasma MALAT1 may act as a valuable biomarker for the diagnosis of metastasis.
