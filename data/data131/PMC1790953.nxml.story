Discovering general principles underlying the effects of toxicant exposure on biological systems is one of the central challenges of toxicological research. We have discovered a previously unrecognized regulatory pathway on which chemically diverse toxicants converge, at environmentally relevant exposure levels, to disrupt the function of progenitor cells of the developing central nervous system. We found that the ability of low levels of methylmercury, lead, and paraquat to make progenitor cells more oxidized causes activation of an enzyme called Fyn kinase. Activated Fyn then activates another enzyme (c-Cbl) that modifies specific proteins—receptors that are required for cell division and survival—to initiate the proteins' degradation. By enhancing degradation of these receptors, their downstream signaling functions are repressed. Analysis of developmental exposure to methylmercury provided evidence that this same pathway is activated in vivo by environmentally relevant toxicant levels. The remarkable sensitivity of progenitor cells to low levels of toxicant exposure, and the discovery of the redox/Fyn/c-Cbl pathway as a mechanism by which small increases in oxidative status can markedly alter cell function, provide a novel and specific means by which exposure to chemically diverse toxicants might perturb normal development. In addition, the principles revealed in our studies appear likely to have broad applicability in understanding the regulation of cell function by alterations in redox balance, regardless of how they might be generated.
