The present study aimed to reveal the molecular mechanisms of multiple myeloma (MM) and monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS). This was a secondary study on microarray dataset GSE80608, downloaded from the Gene Expression Omnibus database, which included 10 control samples, 10 MGUS samples and 10 MM samples. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified between control and MGUS samples, and between control and MM samples. A protein-protein interaction (PPI) network was built for studying the interactions between the DEGs. Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathway enrichment analysis was performed for the genes in a gene co-expression network. A microRNA (miRNA/miR)-gene network was built to the evaluate possible the miRNAs and genes involved in the diseases. The present study identified 136 common upregulated DEGs and 165 common downregulated DEGs between MM and MGUS. Pathway enrichment analysis of the genes in the gene co-expression network revealed that the complement and coagulation cascades pathway was significantly enriched for certain complement and coagulation-associated genes. Endothelin-1 (EDN1) was significantly enriched in the hypoxia inducible factor-1 (HIF-1) and tumor necrosis factor signaling pathways. EDN1 was an important node in the PPI network, and a target gene of let-7e, let-7b and miR-19a in the miRNA-gene network. The results of the present study indicate that complement and coagulation-associated genes, the complement and coagulation cascades pathway, EDN1, let-7e, let-7b-5p, miR-19a, and the tumor necrosis factor and HIF-1 signaling pathways may all be implicated in MM and MGUS.
