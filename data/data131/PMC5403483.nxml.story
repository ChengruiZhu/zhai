The gold standard following segmental mandibulectomy is vascularized autologous bone graft in the form of the fibula flap. However, in bone reconstruction the use of autogenous bone does not always guarantee a successful outcome. The aim of the present investigation was to develop a novel biologically active bone (BAB) graft, and to use it for the reconstruction of large size defects of the mandible bone following tumor resection. In the first part of the present study, biologically active bone graft was developed by using human freeze-dried bone marrow stem cells (BMSCs) paracrine factors and three-dimensional bone scaffold derived from cancellous bovine bone following decellularization. In the second part of the research, one male and three female patients with primary tumors of the mandible underwent hemimandibulectomy. The mandibular bone defects following tumor resection were reconstructed with autogenous rib grafts in three patients and BAB graft was used in one patient. The graft-host interfaces were covered with decellularized human amnion/chorion membrane graft. All patients were followed-up every five months following the reconstruction of the mandible, with no complications observed. Preliminary clinical investigations demonstrated that a BAB graft containing freeze-dried BMSC paracrine factors may be used for the reconstruction of large mandibular bone defects following tumor resection.
