Bacterial and retroviral superantigens (SAGs) stimulate a high proportion of T cells expressing specific variable regions of the T cell receptor (TCR) beta chain. Although most alleles and isotypes bind SAGs, polymorphisms of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II molecules affect their presentation to T cells. This observation has raised the possibility that a TCR-MHC class II interaction can occur during this recognition process. To address the importance of such interactions during SAG presentation, we have used a panel of murine T cell hybridomas that respond to the bacterial SAG Staphylococcal enterotoxin B (SEB) and to the retroviral SAG Mtv-7 when presented by antigen-presenting cells (APCs) expressing HLA-DR1. Amino acid substitutions of the putative TCR contact residues 59, 64, 66, 77, and 81 on the DR1 beta chain showed that these amino acids are critical for recognition of the SAG SEB by T cells. TCR-MHC class II interactions are thus required for T cell recognition of SAG. Moreover, Mtv-7 SAG recognition by the same T cell hybridomas was not affected by these mutations, suggesting that the topology of the TCR-MHC class II-SAG trimolecular complex could be different from one TCR to another and from one SAG to another.
