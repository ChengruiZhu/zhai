Mitochondria are organelles which are best known as the cell's energy powerhouses. They have a special evolutionary origin derived from bacteria engulfed about 2 billion years ago by eukaryotes. Surprisingly, mitochondrial functions have been retained over evolution, so that unicellular yeast and multicellular organisms like humans share many of the same mitochondrial components. Here the authors complemented previous efforts to identify the “parts” of the mitochondrial system, but as for any system, this is not enough to understand how it works. By integrating information on protein localization, function, and interaction, the authors go a step further and propose a map of the mitochondrial organelle and its surroundings. This map suggests the involvement of hundreds of so far uncharacterized proteins in mitochondrial function. By taking advantage of the high conservation of the organelle to humans, the authors investigate properties of human genes involved in mitochondrial diseases. They find that the disease genes have ancient origin and a mild mutant phenotype when their function is abolished in yeast. The approach applied here can be extended to other organelles or organisms and illustrates a growing trend in understanding biological processes in their whole rather than in isolated parts.
