We compared static preservation (cold storage, CS, 4 °C) with dynamic preservation (machine perfusion, MP, 20 °C) followed by reperfusion using marginal livers: a model of donation after cardiac death (DCD) livers and two models of fatty livers, the methionine-choline deficient (MCD) diet model, and obese Zucker (fa/fa) rats. CS injury in DCD livers was reversed by an oxygenated washout (OW): hepatic damage, bile flow, and the ATP/ADP ratio in the OW + CS group was comparable with the ratio obtained with MP. Using fatty livers, CS preservation induced a marked release in hepatic and biliary enzymes in obese Zucker rats when compared with the MCD group. The same trend occurred for bile flow. No difference was found when comparing MP in MCD and obese Zucker rats. Fatty acid analysis demonstrated that the total saturated (SFA)/polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) ratio was, respectively, 1.5 and 0.71 in obese Zucker and MCD rats. While preservation damage in DCD livers is associated with the ATP/ADP recovered with OW, injury in fatty livers is linked to fatty acid constituents: livers from obese. Zucker rats, with greater content in saturated FA, might be more prone to CS injury. On the contrary, MCD livers with elevated PUFA content might be less susceptible to hypothermia.
