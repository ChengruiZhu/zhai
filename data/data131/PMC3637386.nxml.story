Immediate type allergy to latex is still a widespread problem. Latex-allergic patients undergoing diagnostic and operative medical procedures are at risk of potentially life-threatening reactions. Accurate diagnostic methods are therefore crucial. The aim of this retrospective study was to discriminate between sensitization and relevant allergy to latex based on an easy and suitable diagnostic approach. In 14 patients with clinical symptoms and 27 controls, latex skin prick tests (SPT), IgE against latex (CAP) and serological component resolved specific latex-allergen determination (Hev b1, b3, b5, b6, b7, b8, b9, b10, b11) based on ImmunoCAP ISAC were performed. SPT correlated very well with clinically manifest latex-allergy demonstrating a high specificity (95%) (and a low sensitivity). However, CAP levels to crude latex could not safely discriminate between purely sensitized and latex-allergic patients. The majority of patients mono-sensitized to the latex profilin Hev b8 did not suffer from any relevant symptoms upon contact with latex. However, in two patients with latex-allergy diagnosed by elevated specific IgE only sensitized against Hev b8, additional sensitization to carbohydrate cross-reactive determinants (CCD) was found. In the case of positive serum IgE against latex and negative SPT, component-resolved diagnosis including IgE against specific latex-proteins, specially Hev b8, and carbohydrate cross-reactive determinants (CCD) is a useful tool to discriminate between latex-sensitization and latex-allergy.
