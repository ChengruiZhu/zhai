The current study reports a case of an extremely rare tumor that presented in an uncommon location, which was successfully treated via radical resection and reconstruction. A 37-year-old female, with no notable medical history, with the exception of a cesarean delivery, was admitted to The First Affiliated Hospital of Wenzhou Medical University (Wenzhou, China) due to pain and a lump of the anterior chest wall. The mass was identified on the manubrium sterni and was not tender on palpation. A chest computed tomography (CT) scan reconstruction identified the abnormal mass on the manubrium sterni (size, 5Ã—4 cm in diameter) and positron emission tomography-CT interpretation strongly indicated a type of well-differentiated malignant tumor, such as a giant cell tumor. An aspiration needle biopsy was not conducted, however, the patient underwent tumor radical resection and sternal reconstruction using steel wire and titanium mesh. Histopathological examination of the surgical specimen determined the diagnosis of chondrosarcoma. A postoperative chest X-ray revealed that the sternal defect had repaired well, therefore, this procedure may be highly beneficial in future for repairing defects in the sternum.
