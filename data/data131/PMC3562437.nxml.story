The objective was to examine the relationship between fulfilment of expectations and health-related quality of life 4 and 12 months after gastric bypass. A follow-up study based on patients undergoing gastric bypass at Aalborg Hospital – Aarhus University Hospital during February 2008 to December 2009. Health-related quality of life was assessed by Short Form 36 and summarized into the physical component summary and the mental component summary. Information on expectations was questionnaire based. Associations were analysed by linear regression. Included were 87 gastric bypass patients. Compared with patients with fulfilled expectations having expectations partly fulfilled −7.3 (−11.3; −3.3) or not having expectations fulfilled −11.2 (−18.8 ; −3.5) was associated with low a mental component summary 4 months after surgery. At 12 months follow-up patients who reported not to have expectations fulfilled had a low mental component summary score −16.3 (−26.5; −6.2) when compared to their counterparts with fulfilment of expectations. Not having expectations to changes in general well-being fulfilled is associated with low mental component summary. This is seen at follow-up points 4 and 12 months after gastric bypass.
