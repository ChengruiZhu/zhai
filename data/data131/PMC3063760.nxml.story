Stereocilia are the fingerlike projections of inner ear hair cells that detect sound and motion. Stereocilia grow to specific lengths and diameters and form staircase-like arrays. The changes in size appear to be driven by matching alterations in the dimensions of an underlying molecular scaffold consisting of a bundle of actin filaments cross-linked by actin-bundling proteins. To elucidate the roles of the espin actin-bundling proteins in hair cell stereocilia, we carry out an in-depth accounting of stereociliary size and shape in the jerker mutant mouse, which lacks the espin proteins because of a mutation in the espin gene. We examine a new and improved jerker mouse with a genetic background known for high-quality lifelong hearing. We find that, in the absence of espins, stereocilia do not increase in diameter or complete their elongation, but instead bend, shorten, and disappear. Although the specifics vary according to inner ear region, the stereociliary defects are profound and can readily account for the deafness and balance problems of jerker mice and humans with certain espin gene mutations. Even reducing espin levels by one-half leads to temporary defects in stereociliary diameter. Thus, espins play crucial roles in the formation and maintenance of hair cell stereocilia.
