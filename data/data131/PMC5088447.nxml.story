Increased severity of diabetic retinopathy was associated with an increase in plasma levels of TBARS (F = 10.92; p < 0.001), NO (F = 21.8; p < 0.001) and HbA1c (F = 5.87; p = 0.001). Increase in CST (F = 61.51; p < 0.001) and CAT (F = 60.84; p < 0.001) was also found to be associated with increased severity of diabetic retinopathy. Pearson’s correlation analysis revealed a positive correlation of TBARS with CST (r = 0.29; p = 0.038) and CAT (r = 0.31; p = 0.04). A positive correlation of NO with CST (r = 0.27; p = 0.03) and CAT (r = 0.7; p = 0.001) was also observed. On univariate analysis with logMAR visual acuity as dependent variable, a significant increase in visual acuity was observed with increase in independent variables TBARS (B = 0.22; p = 0.004), NO (B = 0.006; p < 0.001), CST (B = 0.005; p < 0.001) and CAT (B = 0.005; p < 0.001). On multivariate linear regression analysis with logMAR visual acuity as dependent variable and adjusting for other factors like duration of diabetes and HbA1c, it was observed that increase in independent variables TBARS (B = 0.07), NO (B = 0.001) and CST (B = 0.004) independently predict increase in logMAR visual acuity (p < 0.001).
