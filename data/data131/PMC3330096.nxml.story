DNA polymerases are required during both DNA replication and various types of DNA repair. DNA double-strand breaks are frequently repaired by homologous recombination, a conservative process in which DNA is copied into the break site from a similar template. The specific polymerases that operate during homologous recombination repair of DNA double-strand breaks have not been fully characterized in multicellular organisms. In this study, we created mutant strains of Drosophila lacking one or more DNA polymerases and determined their ability to synthesize large amounts of DNA during homologous recombination. We found that the error-prone translesion polymerases eta and zeta play overlapping roles during the initiation of synthesis, while the Pol32 subunit of the replicative polymerase delta complex is required for repair involving large amounts of synthesis. In addition, we showed that flies lacking the Rev1 translesion polymerase synthesize more DNA during gap repair than their normal counterparts. Our results demonstrate that both replicative and translesion polymerases are involved in homologous recombination and identify Rev1 as a protein that may regulate the access of various polymerases to double-strand break repair intermediates.
