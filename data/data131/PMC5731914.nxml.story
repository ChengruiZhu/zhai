 experiments to examine whether metformin prevents injury-induced peritendinous fibrosis. We found that tendon injury induced severe fibrosis formation in rats. However, orally administered metformin significantly alleviated the fibrosis based on macroscopic and histological evaluation. Peritendinous tissue from metformin-treated rats also showed decreased expression of fibrotic genes including col1a1, col3a1, and α-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA), and inhibition of transforming growth factor (TGF)-β1 signaling. The cell counting kit (CCK)-8, flow cytometry, and 5-ethynyl-2′-deoxyuridine (EdU) staining analyses showed that treatment of NIH/3T3 fibroblasts with metformin significantly inhibited excessive cell proliferation and promoted cell apoptosis. Metformin treatment also inhibited the expression of fibrotic genes and decreased the phosphorylation of smad2/3 and extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) 1/2. Furthermore, blocking AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) signaling abolished the inhibitory effect of metformin on fibrosis. Our findings indicate that metformin has a protective role against peritendinous tissue fibrosis and suggest its clinical use could be a promising therapeutic approach.
