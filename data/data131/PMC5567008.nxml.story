Hidradenitis suppurativa (HS) is a challenging skin disease with limited therapeutic options. Obesity and metabolic syndrome are being increasingly implicated and associated with younger ages and greater metabolic severity. A 19-year-old female with an 8-year history of progressively debilitating cicatricial HS disease presented with obesity, profound anemia, leukocytosis, increased platelet count, hypoalbuminemia, and elevated liver enzymes. A combination of metformin, liraglutide, levonorgestrel-ethinyl estradiol, dapsone, and finasteride was initiated. Acute antibiotic use for recurrences and flares could be slowly discontinued. Over the course of 3 years on this regimen, the liver enzymes normalized in 1 year, followed in2 years by complete resolution of the majority of the hematological and metabolic abnormalities. The sedimentation rate reduced from over 120 to 34 mm/h. She required 1 surgical intervention for perianal disease after 9 months on the regimen. Flares greatly diminished in intensity and duration, with none in the past 6 months. Right axillary lesions have completely healed with residual disease greatly reduced. Chiefly abdominal lesions are persistent. She was able to complete high school from home, start a job, and resume a normal life. Initial weight loss of 40 pounds was not maintained. The current regimen is being well tolerated and continued.
