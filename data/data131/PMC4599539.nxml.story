We investigated the patterns of use and site-level variability in anticoagulant strategies (unfractionated heparin [UFH] only, low-molecular-weight heparin [LMWH] only, UFH+LMWH, any bivalirudin) of 63 796 patients with a principal diagnosis of myocardial infarction treated with an early invasive strategy with percutaneous coronary intervention at 257 hospitals. About half (47%) of patients received UFH only, 6% UFH+LMWH, 7% LMWH only, and 40% bivalirudin. Compared with UFH, the median odds ratio was 2.90 for LMWH+UFH, 4.70 for LMWH only, and 3.09 for bivalirudin, indicating that 2 “identical” patients would have a 3- to 4-fold greater likelihood of being treated with anticoagulants other than UFH at one hospital compared with another. We then categorized hospitals as low- or high-users of LMWH and bivalirudin. Using hierarchical, multivariate regression models, we found that low bivalirudin-using hospitals had higher unadjusted bleeding rates, but the risk-adjusted and anticoagulant-adjusted bleeding rates did not differ across the hospital anticoagulation phenotypes. Risk-standardized mortality and risk-standardized length of stay also did not differ across hospital phenotypes.
