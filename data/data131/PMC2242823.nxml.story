Short-term synaptic plasticity is ubiquitous in brain circuits, but its function in sensorimotor processing remains unclear. We propose a parsimonious model of motion processing using short-term depression to produce directionally selective responses. In the model circuit, information from two spatially separated receptive fields is combined after being asymmetrically processed by synapses that either exhibit short-term synaptic depression or do not. Motion in a preferred direction leads to a constructive interaction between the two channels; motion in the opposite direction does not. The model represents short-term synaptic depression as two processes with distinct time constants. The faster process alone suffices to generate direction selectivity in the circuit. The slow process, in contrast, can enhance direction selectivity to sustained stimuli. Therefore, the slow process mediates a form of attentional shift from alert, where the neuron responds more vigorously, to discriminating, where the neuron responds more selectively with fewer spikes. This explains a previously observed enhancement of direction selectivity in weakly electric fish in the presence of global synchronous gamma-band oscillations. These findings suggest a mechanistic connection between gamma-band oscillations and attention.
