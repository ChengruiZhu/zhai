Cefquinome Sulfate (CS) is a fourth-generation cephalosporin, which has been developed solely for veterinary use. It shows potent antibacterial activity against a broad spectrum of bacterial species. However, Cefquinome is susceptible to hydrolysis, which limiting its clinical employment efficacies to some extent. So, in this study, to increase Cefquinome Sulfate biological half-life, a novel Cefquinome Sulfate proliposome was prepared by solid dispersion and effervescent techniques and characterized for morphology, particle size, entrapment efficiency and in vitro release. A Reversed Phase-High Performance Liquid Chromatography (RP–HPLC) method was first chosen and established to determine the drug concentration in plasma after intra muscular (IM) administrating Cefquinome Sulfate solution and liposome at a single dosage of 18 mg/kg in rabbit. Then their pharmacokinetics in vivo was compared. Results showed that the received liposome was milky white suspension, spherical or ellipsoidal in shape. The mean particle size was 203±5 nm and the entrapment efficiency was 53.5±0.16%. The cefaquinom sulfate solution and liposome both followed a two compartment model, in vivo. The pharmacokinetic parameters for the solution and liposomal formulations were measured as follows: t
