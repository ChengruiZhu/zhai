Three-dimensional conformal radiation therapy (3DCRT) has emerged as a preferred treatment for gynecologic malignancies. Yet its superiority to conventional radiotherapy (2-dimensional radiotherapy (2DRT)) for gynecologic malignancies has not been well established. Data from the 2005 to 2010 National Health Insurance Research Database (NHIRD) provided by the National Research Institutes in Taiwan were analyzed to address this issue. Patients were initially diagnosed as having cervical cancer according to the International Classification of Disease, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM) code 180, and this clinical diagnosis was confirmed histopathologically or cytologically. Kaplan-Meier method and Cox proportional hazards regression were used to analyze the reported data. Between January 2005 and December 2010, there were 776 patients with newly diagnosed cervical cancer without metastasis, local recurrence, or surgical treatment before RT and 132 and 644 patients, respectively, who received 2DRT and 3DCRT. After adjustment for age, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, coronary heart disease, hyperlipidemia, side effects, urbanization level, geographic region, and enrollee category in the 5-year follow-up period, the HR was 1.82 (95% CI, 1.16â€“2.85,
