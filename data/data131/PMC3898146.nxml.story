The role of the gut microbiota in the induction of metabolic diseases has now been increasingly recognized worldwide. Indeed, a specific gut microbiota has been shown to characterize lean versus obese phenotypes both in humans and mice. We have also recently demonstrated that a precise gut microbiota is associated with the hostâ€™s responsiveness to a high-fat diet. Therefore, we hypothesized that insulin resistance in humans could also be linked to a specific gut microbiota. To this aim, microbial DNA and RNA were extracted from the appendix contents of insulin-resistant versus insulin-sensitive obese subjects, matched for body mass index and age, and analyzed by DNA- and RNA-DGGE. Microbial DNA analysis showed that the patients fully segregated according to their degree of insulin action. Conversely, microbial RNA investigation showed that some degree of homology still existed between insulin-sensitive and insulin-resistant patients. Quantitative trait analysis, ordinary least squares regression, principal components regression, partial least squares, canonical correlation analysis, and canonical correspondence analysis also showed a net separation of the two phenotypes analyzed. We conclude that a specific gut microbial profile is associated with insulin action in humans.
