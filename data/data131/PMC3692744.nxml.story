The S&I Framework is an Office of National Coordinator (ONC) initiative designed to support individual working groups who focus on a specific interoperability challenge. One of these working groups within the S&I Framework is the PHRI, which is using the S&I Framework as a platform for a community-led project focused on simplifying public health reporting and ensuring EHR interoperability with public health information systems. PHRI hopes to create a new public health reporting objective for Meaningful Use Stage 3 that is broader than the current program-specific objectives and will lay the ground work for all public health reporting in the future. To date, the initiative received over 30 descriptions of different types of public health reporting that were then grouped into 5 domain categories. Each domain category was decomposed into component elements and commonalities were identified. The PHRI is now working to reconstruct a single model of public health reporting through a consensus process that will soon lead to a pilot demonstration of the most ready reporting types. This panel will outline progress, challenges, and next steps of the initiative as well as describe how the initiative may affect a standard language for biosurveillance reporting.
