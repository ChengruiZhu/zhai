Integrated Information Theory (IIT) of consciousness attracts scientists who investigate consciousness owing to its explanatory and predictive powers for understanding the neural properties of consciousness. IIT predicts that the levels of consciousness are related to the quantity of information integrated in the brain, which is called integrated information Φ. Integrated information measures excess information generated by a system as a whole above and beyond the amount of information independently generated by its parts. Although IIT predictions are indirectly supported by numerous experiments, validation is required through quantifying integrated information directly from experimental neural data. Practical difficulties account for the absence of direct, quantitative support. To resolve these difficulties, several practical measures of integrated information have been proposed. However, we found that these measures do not satisfy the theoretical requirements of integrated information: First, integrated information should not be below 0; and second, integrated information should not exceed the quantity of information generated by the whole system. Here, we propose a novel practical measure of integrated information, designated as Φ* that satisfies these theoretical requirements by introducing the concept of mismatched decoding developed from information theory. Φ* creates the possibility of empirical and quantitative validations of IIT to gain novel insights into the neural basis of consciousness.
