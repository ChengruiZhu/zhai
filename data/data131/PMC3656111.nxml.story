A fundamental property of living cells is their ability to detect mechanical stimuli. Microbes, in particular, often transition between different chemical environments, leading to osmotic shock and concurrent changes in membrane tension. The tension of microbial cell membranes is detected and controlled by membrane molecules such as the widely-studied mechanosensitive channels which, depending on the tension exerted by the surrounding lipid bilayer, switch between closed and open states. Thus, the biological function of mechanosensitive channels relies on an interplay between bilayer mechanical properties and protein structure. Using a physical model of cell membranes it was shown previously that the basic phenomenology of mechanosensitive gating can be understood in terms of the bilayer deformations induced by mechanosensitive channels. We have generalized this physical model to allow for the molecular structures of mechanosensitive channels reported in recent experiments. Our methodology allows the calculation of protein-induced membrane deformations for arbitrary oligomeric states of membrane proteins. We predict that distinct oligomeric states and hydrophobic shapes of mechanosensitive channels lead to distinct functional responses to membrane tension. Our results suggest that the shape of membrane proteins, and resulting structure of membrane deformations, plays a crucial role in the regulation of protein function by bilayer membranes.
