WHO/CDC recommendations prioritize influenza vaccinations primarily on the basis of age co-morbidities, but have never considered targeting vaccination for individuals previously infected with influenza. An individual's infection risk is governed by his or her contacts as manifested by his or her social interactions. Thus, through contact network simulations that capture contact patterns, we show here that individuals previously infected with influenza have a disproportionate probability of being highly connected within networks and thus serve as the super-spreaders. Accordingly, targeting them is effective in curtailing transmission. In addition to social interaction, a variety of factors, including genetics, co-morbidities, demographics, and epidemiological characteristics, may affect the risk and severity of influenza infection. Regardless of whether individuals are predisposed to infection because of these factors, or social interactions, we show that they can be identified through previous infection. Empirically, our analysis of medical records of influenza diagnosed in both hospitals and clinics confirms that in every age group, case definition for influenza, clinical diagnosis, and year tested, patients infected in the year prior had a substantially higher risk of becoming infected in the subsequent year. Thus, considering individual infection history in targeting and promoting influenza vaccination is predicted to be a highly effective supplement to the current prioritizations as it focuses on people with greater risk to become infected and transmit.
