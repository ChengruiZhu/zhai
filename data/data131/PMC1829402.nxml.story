Methods of haplotype-based analysis and single-locus analysis are widely used in genetic association studies. There is no consensus as to the best strategy for the performance of the two methods. Although haplotype-based analysis is a powerful tool, the large number of distinct haplotypes may reduce its efficiency. Haplotype clustering analysis is a promising way of decreasing haplotype dimensionality. A potential limitation of many existing clustering methods is that they do not allow the clustering to adapt to the position of the underlying trait locus. In this study, we proposed a weighted haplotype cladistic analysis method by incorporating a single-locus test into haplotype clustering. Under this framework, relationships between single loci and the disease outcomes can be considered when creating the hierarchical tree of haplotypes. The extensive simulations show that our method is robust against varied simulation conditions and is more powerful than either the original unweighted cladistic analysis method or single-locus analysis methods in case-control studies. Our hybrid method combining haplotype-based and single-locus analyses can be readily extended to whole genome association studies.
