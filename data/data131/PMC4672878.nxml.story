Defensins are classically known as antimicrobial peptides due to their ability to rapidly kill pathogens including bacteria, viruses and fungi. They are produced in the presence of infectious agents at body surfaces exposed to the environment. Increasingly, their functional repertoire is expanding, and they have been shown to modulate the immune system. In humans, there is a block of six β-defensin genes that varies in copy number in the population. Individuals with an increased number of β-defensin genes have an increased likelihood of developing the skin autoimmune disease psoriasis. It is not known how this increase in gene copy number influences development of the disease, and psoriasis is a complex interplay of genomic and environmental factors that trigger disease progression and include exposure to viruses. We examined whether a molecular pattern characteristic of viruses produces an altered immune response in the presence of the defensin human β-defensin 3 (hBD3). We find that hBD3 triggers a larger interferon defence response to this viral mimic by increasing accessibility to a cellular receptor that recognises viral patterns. Interferon is known to be important in autoimmunity and our work may explain why individuals with increased β-defensin number are predisposed to develop psoriasis.
