Cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) is a second messenger that may be associated with olfactory function. No known studies have compared existing collection methods for determining nasal cAMP levels. This is a prospective study comparing the comfort and reliability of the nasal curette and cytobrush. A secondary outcome collected for feasibility testing was characterizing the association between cAMP and olfactory function. We enrolled 19 normal olfaction and 10 olfactory dysfunction subjects. Olfaction was measured by the University of Pennsylvania Smell Identification Test. Two samples were obtained from each nasal cavity at the initial visit and at 1 week follow-up. Comfort was measured by a visual analog scale (VAS). cAMP levels were determined by an enzyme immunoassay. For the curette and cytobrush, mean VAS scores were 0.3 and 0.7 cm (p = 0.48). Intraclass correlation coefficients were 0.81 (curette) and 0.65 (cytobrush) for the initial visit and 0.64 and 0.54 between the initial and follow-up visit. Using the curette, mean cAMP was 537 and 480 fmol/(mg/mL) for the normal and dysfunction cohorts (p = 0.18). Using the cytobrush, cAMP was 505 and 477, respectively (p = 0.65). The curette and cytobrush are both comfortable and reliable collection methods for determining nasal cAMP levels.
