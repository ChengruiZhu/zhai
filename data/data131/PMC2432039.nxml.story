Advances in SNP genotyping array technologies have made whole-genome association studies (WGAS) a readily available approach. Genetic coverage and the statistical power are two key properties to evaluate on the arrays. In this study, 359 newly sampled individuals were genotyped using Affymetrix 500K and Illumina 650Y SNP arrays. From these data, we obtained new estimates of genetic coverage by constructing a test set from among these genotypes and individuals that is independent from the SNPs and individuals used to construct the arrays. These estimates are notably smaller than previous ones, which we argue is due to an overfitting bias in previous studies. We also collected liver tissue RNA from the participants and profiled these samples on a comprehensive gene expression microarray. The RNA levels were used as a large-scale set of quantitative traits to calibrate the relative statistical power of the commercial arrays. Through this dataset and simulations, we find that the SNP arrays provide adequate power to detect quantitative trait loci when the causal SNP's minor allele frequency is greater than 20%, but low power is less than 10%. Importantly, we provide evidence that sample size has a greater impact on the power of WGAS than SNP density or genetic coverage.
