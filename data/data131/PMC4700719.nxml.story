Dyslipidemia is a significant morbidity associated with diabetes and cardiovascular disorders. The present study was undertaken to assess the lipid profile of type 2 diabetic and age-gender matched healthy subjects and its association, if any, with fasting plasma glucose. Clinically diagnosed diabetic subjects were recruited for the study. The fasting plasma glucose and lipid profiles were analyzed for 99 diabetic and 101 healthy volunteers. The blood samples were analyzed for fasting plasma glucose, total cholesterol, triglycerides, high density lipoprotein-cholesterol, low density lipoprotein-cholesterol and very low density lipoprotein-cholesterol. Correlation analysis of lipid profile with fasting plasma glucose and calculation of risk ratio was done. The levels of high density lipoprotein-cholesterol and low density lipoprotein-cholesterol were found to be significantly low in diabetics and subjects with lower low density lipoprotein-cholesterol were on statins. Inspite of lower lipid values, the risk ratio for diabetics was significantly higher. The correlation analysis indicated significant difference in relationship between fasting plasma glucose, lipid parameters and risk ratios in the two groups. Diabetics with lower high density lipoprotein-cholesterol and higher total cholesterol present with a higher risk ratio pointing to need of non-statin high density lipoprotein-raising medications decreasing their predisposition to cardiovascular disorders. The study highlights the altered pattern of correlation of lipid profile with fasting plasma glucose in diabetics and their increased risk of cardiovascular disorders. The dyslipidemia in the form of triglyceridemia and significantly low high density lipoprotein-cholesterol in diabetics point towards the need of non-statin high density lipoprotein-raising medications.
