Differences in ion channel composition endow different neuronal types with distinct computational properties. Understanding how these biophysical differences affect network-level computation is an important frontier. We focus on a set of biophysical properties, experimentally observed in developing cortical neurons, that allow these neurons to efficiently encode their inputs despite time-varying changes in the statistical context. Large-scale propagating waves are autonomously generated by the developing brain even before the onset of sensory experience. Using multi-layered feedforward networks, we examine how changes in intrinsic properties can lead to changes in the network's ability to represent and transmit information on multiple timescales. We demonstrate that measured changes in the computational properties of immature single neurons enable the propagation of slow-varying wave-like inputs. In contrast, neurons with more mature properties are more sensitive to fast fluctuations, which modulate the slow-varying information. While slow events are transmitted with high fidelity in initial network layers, noise degrades transmission in downstream network layers. Our results show how short-term adaptation and modulation of the neurons' input-output firing curves by background synaptic noise determine the ability of neural networks to transmit information on multiple timescales.
