Numerous randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies and observational studies have demonstrated that statins decrease mortality and major cardiovascular events in older high-risk persons with hypercholesterolemia. The Heart Protection Study found that statins decreased mortality and major cardiovascular events in high-risk persons regardless of the initial level of serum lipids, age, or gender. The updated National Cholesterol Education Program (NCEP) III guidelines state that in very high-risk patients, a serum low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol level of <70 mg/dl is a reasonable clinical strategy, regardless of age. When a high-risk person has hypertriglyceridemia or low serum high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, consideration can be given to combining a fibrate or nicotinic acid with an LDL cholesterol-lowering drug. For moderately high-risk persons (2 or more risk factors and a 10-year risk for coronary heart disease of 10% to 20%), the serum LDL cholesterol should be decreased to <100 mg/dl. When LDL cholesterol-lowering drug therapy is used to treat high-risk persons or moderately high-risk persons, the serum LDL cholesterol should be decreased at least 30% to 40%.
