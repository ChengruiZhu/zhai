Communication between cells is essential for the survival of any multicellular organism. When these mechanisms cannot function properly, diseases can occur such as heart failure or Parkinsonâ€™s disease. Understanding cell communication is therefore crucial for drug development. Important proteins in cellular signalling are the ones that initiate mechanisms in the cell after the signal of an extracellular trigger is transported from outside to inside the cell. G proteins (GPs) are an example of such proteins. Experimental studies have shown that GPs can perform stimulatory or inhibitory functions, however, it is not well understood what the difference is in their mode of action, especially as they are structurally very similar. Adenylyl cyclase (AC) is an enzyme which can be stimulated or inhibited by GPs, depending on which type of GP is active. Hence, AC is a good candidate for investigating the difference in function between GPs. However, only the structure of the stimulatory GP interacting with AC is known. Here, we investigate for the first time the effect of the interaction of an inhibitory GP with AC via classical molecular dynamics simulations in order to obtain a better understanding of the difference between stimulatory and inhibitory GP association and AC regulation.
