Malignancy is an important cause of death in transplant recipients. Cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (cSCC) causes significant morbidity and mortality as 30% of transplant recipients will develop cSCC within 10 years of transplantation. Previously we have shown that high numbers of regulatory T cells (Tregs) are associated with the development of cSCC in kidney transplant recipients (KTRs). Demethylation analysis of the Treg-specific demethylated region (TSDR) provides a more accurate association with cSCC risk after transplantation. Age, gender and duration of immunosuppression matched KTRs with (n = 32) and without (n = 27) cSCC, were re-analyzed for putative clinical and immunological markers of cancer risk. The proportion of FOXP3+ CD4+ cells was higher in the population with a previous SCC. Major T cell subsets remained stable over time; although B cell, CD8 and CD4 subpopulations demonstrated age-related changes. TSDR methylation analysis allowed clarification of Treg numbers, enhancing the association of high Treg levels in KTRs with cSCC compared to the cSCC-free cohort. These data validate and expand on previous findings in long-term KTRs, and show that immune markers remain stable over time. TSDR demethylation analysis provides a more accurate biomarker of cancer posttransplantation.
