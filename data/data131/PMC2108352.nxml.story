 Particles having ribosome-like characteristics are described in proplastids of dark-grown wheat seedlings as the membranes of the prolamellar body become transformed, under the influence of light, into grana and fret membranes. Three arrangements of particles were noted: (1) a random distribution of discrete particles; (2) particles occurring in helices or parallel rows; and (3) particles arranged in rough squares with six to eight particles per side. It is possible that the third type of particle is a cross-section of long parallel rods. A particle ranges in size from 170 to 220 A, those of group three being somewhat smaller. The particulates vary from diamond shaped with smooth surfaces to circular with irregular surfaces. These particles have the characteristics of ribosomes as visualized by the electron microscope: they are preserved by glutaraldehyde and osmium tetroxide, they stain intensely with uranyl acetate, and are digested by RNase. Their properties do not coincide with those of viruses, smog-induced particles, stromacenter particles, or phytoferritin. They are frequently adjacent to membranes but never attached to membranes. The involvement of ribosomes in membrane development is discussed.
