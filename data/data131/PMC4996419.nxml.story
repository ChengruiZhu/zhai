Species often engage in mutualistic interactions that are beneficial for both partners. However, there is also a cost associated with cooperation, for example, in the form of energy required to make nutrients for a partner. When environments change, the costs and benefits of cooperating can change as well, and this can cause the mutualistic interaction to break down into other interaction types, such as parasitism. In this study, we varied nutrient availability to examine how changing environments can affect the interaction between two cross-feeding yeast strains. Lower nutrient concentrations made each strain more dependent on the nutrients provided by its partner strain and thus favored cooperation. Using both experiments and mathematic models, we found that in different environments, these yeast strains can interact in at least seven different qualitatively different ways, including obligate mutualism, facultative mutualism, parasitism, and competition. We also found that the dynamics of how the two strains influence each other change drastically in different nutrient concentrations. Examining the population dynamics could therefore potentially be used to predict the stability or collapse of a community.
