The single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the microRNA precursor (pre-miRNA) may modulate the posttranscriptional regulation of gene expression and explain individual sensitivity to chemotherapy. Here we investigated the correlation between 23 SNPs in the pre-miRNA and the efficacy of capecitabine-based chemotherapy in 274 advanced colon cancer patients. Statistical analysis indicated that much more patients with rs744591 A/C(48.03%), C/C (53.45%) or C allele (49.73%) responded to the chemotherapy than those with the A/A genotype (33.71%). The response rates of rs745666 G/C heterozygous patients (35.25%) and C allele carriers (39.69%) were apparently less than that of the G/G homozygous patients (56.25%). Moreover, three SNPs rs2114358, rs35770269, and rs73239138 were significantly associated with the occurrence of side effects of chemotherapy. The patients with rs2114358 C allele (OR = 2.016) or rs35770269 T allele (OR = 2.299) were much more prone to endure adverse events. However, the incidence of side effect was lower in the patients carrying rs73239138 A allele than those with G/G genotype (OR = 0.500). Our findings demonstrate that genetic variations in pre-miRNA may influence the efficacy of capecitabine-based chemotherapy in advanced colon cancer patients.
