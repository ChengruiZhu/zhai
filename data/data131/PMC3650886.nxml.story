Dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitors have recently emerged as a new class of antidiabetic that show favorable results in improving glycemic control with a minimal risk of hypoglycemia and weight gain. Teneligliptin, a novel DPP-4 inhibitor, exhibits a unique structure characterized by five consecutive rings, which produce a potent and long-lasting effect. Teneligliptin is currently used in cases showing insufficient improvement in glycemic control even after diet control and exercise or a combination of diet control, exercise, and sulfonylurea- or thiazolidine-class drugs. In adults, teneligliptin is orally administered at a dosage of 20 mg once daily, which can be increased up to 40 mg per day. Because the metabolites of this drug are eliminated via renal and hepatic excretion, no dose adjustment is necessary in patients with renal impairment. The safety profile of teneligliptin is similar to those of other available DPP-4 inhibitors. However, caution needs to be exercised when administering teneligliptin to patients who are prone to QT prolongation. One study has reported that the postprandial blood glucose-lowering effects of teneligliptin administered prior to breakfast were sustained throughout the day, and the effects observed after dinner were similar to those observed after breakfast or lunch. Thus, although clinical data for this new drug are limited, this drug shows promise in stabilizing glycemic fluctuations throughout the day and consequently suppressing the progression of diabetic complications. However, continued evaluation in long-term studies and clinical trials is required to evaluate the efficacy and safety of the drug as well as to identify additional indications for its clinical use.
