Drug treatment and/or implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) implantation are the most widely accepted first-line therapies for channelopathic patients who have recurrent syncope, sustained ventricular tachycardia (VT), or documented ventricular fibrillation (VF), or are survivors of cardiac arrest. In recent years, there have been significant advances in mapping techniques and ablation technology, coupled with better understanding of the mechanisms of ventricular tachyarrhythmia in channelopathies. Catheter ablation has provided important insights into the role of the Purkinje network and the right ventricular outflow tract in the initiation and perpetuation of VT/VF, and has evolved as a promising treatment modality for ventricular tachyarrhythmia even in channelopathies. When patients are exposed to a high risk of sudden cardiac death or deterioration of their quality of life due to episodes of tachycardia and frequent ICD discharges, catheter ablation may be an effective treatment option to reduce the risk of sudden cardiac death and decrease the frequency of cardiac events. In this review, we summarize the current understanding of catheter ablation for VT/VF in patients with channelopathies including Brugada syndrome, idiopathic VF, long QT syndrome, and catecholaminergic polymorphic VT.
