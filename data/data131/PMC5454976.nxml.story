A fatal case associated with enterovirus D68 (EV-D68) infection affecting a 10-year-old boy was reported in Hong Kong in 2014. To examine if a new strain has emerged in Hong Kong, we sequenced the partial genome of the EV-D68 strain identified from the fatal case and the complete VP1, and partial 5â€²UTR and 2C sequences of nine additional EV-D68 strains isolated from patients in Hong Kong. Sequence analysis indicated that a cluster of strains including the previously recognized A2 strains should belong to a separate clade, clade D, which is further divided into subclades D1 and D2. Among the 10 EV-D68 strains, 7 (including the fatal case) belonged to the previously described, newly emerged subclade B3, 2 belonged to subclade B1, and 1 belonged to subclade D1. Three EV-D68 strains, each from subclades B1, B3, and D1, were selected for complete genome sequencing and recombination analysis. While no evidence of recombination was noted among local strains, interclade recombination was identified in subclade D2 strains detected in mainland China in 2008 with VP2 acquired from clade A. This study supports the reclassification of subclade A2 into clade D1, and demonstrates interclade recombination between clades A and D2 in EV-D68 strains from China.
