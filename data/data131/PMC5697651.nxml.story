US prescribing guidelines recommend that 15‐ and 20‐mg doses of rivaroxaban be administered with food for the treatment of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE) and for reduction in the risk of recurrence of DVT and PE. In addition, the US prescribing guidelines recommend these doses be administered with an evening meal to reduce the risk of stroke and systemic embolism in patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation (AF). The purpose of this model‐based cross‐study comparison was to examine the impact of food, with regard to both meal timing and content, on the pharmacokinetics (PK) of rivaroxaban, using data collected during its clinical development. Results of this analysis showed that a PK model built from pooled data in the AF population (for whom rivaroxaban was administered with an evening meal) and in the DVT population (for whom rivaroxaban was administered with a morning meal) can describe both data sets well. Furthermore, the PK model built from data in the AF population alone can adequately predict the PK profile of the DVT population and vice versa. This cross‐study analysis also confirmed the findings from previous clinical pharmacology studies, which showed that meal content does not have a clinically relevant impact on the PK of rivaroxaban at 20 mg. Therefore, although the administration of rivaroxaban with food is necessary for maintaining high bioavailability, neither meal timing nor meal content appears to affect the PK of rivaroxaban.
