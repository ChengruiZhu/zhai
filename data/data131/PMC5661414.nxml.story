In order to investigate the role of translationally-controlled tumor protein (TCTP) in cholangiocarcinoma (CCA) progression and metastasis, TCTP protein staining in paraffin-embedded sections of human CCA tissue samples was examined using immunohistochemistry, and its expression was subsequently compared with clinicopathological parameters. Small interfering RNA (siRNA) targeting TCTP (siTCTP) were transfected into CCA cell lines to evaluate its effects on cellular functions. The proliferation, tumorigenicity and migration abilities of the transfected cells were measured using sulforhodamine B, clonogenic and would healing assays, respectively. The protein levels of TCTP and its associated molecules were evaluated by western blot analysis. Of the 119 individual cases of CCA tissues analyzed, high TCTP scores were significantly correlated with overall metastasis (P=0.044) and a shorter survival time (P<0.001). Multivariate proportional hazards analysis revealed that TCTP is an independent indicator of poor prognosis in CCA (hazard ratio =2.864; P<0.001). siTCTP transfection suppressed CCA cell growth and migration abilities, compared with the control cells (P<0.01). The siTCTP reduced the protein levels of focal adhesion kinase (FAK), phospho-FAK, nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells and matrix metalloproteinase 9, suggesting potential roles of TCTP in regulating CCA progression and metastasis. In conclusion, the upregulation of TCTP is clinically significant in patients with CCA, serving roles in CCA progression, particularly in cell survival and metastasis. Suppression of TCTP may serve as a potential target in CCA prevention and treatment.
