Novel therapeutic approaches are required for the treatment of osteosarcoma. Combination chemotherapy is receiving increased attention in order to identify compounds that may increase the therapeutic index of clinical anticancer drugs. In this regard, naturally occurring molecules with antitumor activity and with limited toxicity to normal tissues have been suggested as possible candidates for investigation of their synergistic efficacy in combination with antineoplastic drugs. Inorganic phosphate (Pi) is an essential nutrient for living organisms. Relevantly, Pi has emerged as an important signaling molecule capable of modulating multiple cellular functions by altering signal transduction pathways, gene expression and protein abundance in many cell types. Previously, we showed that Pi inhibits proliferation and aggressiveness of U2OS human osteosarcoma cells and that Pi is capable of inducing sensitization of osteosarcoma cells to doxorubicin in a p53-dependent manner. In this study, we extended the role of Pi in the chemosensitivity of osteosarcoma cells to other anticancer drugs. Specifically, we report and compare the antiproliferative effects of a combination between Pi and doxorubicin, Taxol
