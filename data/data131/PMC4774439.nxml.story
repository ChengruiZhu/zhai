 for 10 min. A total of 5 rats from each group were sacrificed 21 days following injection and the peritumoral edema tissues were harvested. MMP2 and NKCC1 expression levels were detected in the tissues using immunohistochemistry and western blot analysis. The mRNA expression levels of MMP2 and NKCC1 were observed using reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction. Peritumoral edema was measured using a wet-to-dry weight (W/D) ratio, and survival times of the remaining 10 rats in each group were evaluated. Compared with the control group, tumor growth was significantly suppressed in the PDT group and the survival time was prolonged through a reduction in the expression of MMP2 (P<0.05), and an increased W/D ratio resulted in significantly increased expression of NKCC1 (P<0.05). Compared with the PDT group, the expression of NKCC1 and the W/D ratio in the PDT + torasemide group were significantly decreased (P<0.05), while no significant difference was observed in the expression levels of MMP2. In conclusion, PDT combined with torasemide prolonged the survival time of rats by inhibiting the growth of glioma through a reduction in the expression of MMP2, and by reducing peritumoral edema through a reduction in the expression levels of NKCC1.
