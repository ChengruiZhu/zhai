. The proliferation of the prostate cancer cells was inhibited following treatment with 100 µM ARB. In particular, treatment with fimasartan resulted in marked anti-proliferative activity compared with the other ARBs. With respect to the molecular mechanism of the growth inhibition exhibited by the ARBs, 3-methyladenin (3-MA), an autophagy inhibitor, was revealed to increase the survival rate of PC-3 cells when cell death inhibitors were pretreated with fimasartan. In addition, the ARBs induced autophagy with increased expression levels of autophagy protein (Atg) 5–12, Atg 16-like-1, beclin-1 and microtubule-associated protein 1A/1B-light chain 3 (LC3). Notably, the enhanced expression of LC3-II (a 6.7-fold increase at 72 h) was observed in PC3 cells treated with fimasartan. This was supported by the observation of the time-dependent accumulation of LC3-positive foci in PC-3. In addition, a migration assay indicated that the ARBs induced anti-metastatic effects in PC-3 and DU-145 cells. The aforementioned results suggest that ARBs may induce autophagy-associated cell death and anti-metastatic activity in prostate cancer cells. Thus, ARBs may be a potential medication for patients with prostate cancer and hypertension.
