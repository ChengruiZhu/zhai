Many organisms from bacteria to humans have evolved circadian mechanisms for regulating biological processes on a daily time scale. In cyanobacteria, a minimal system for such cyclical regulation can be reconstituted in vitro from three proteins, called KaiA, KaiB, and KaiC. This three-protein oscillator is believed to regulate the cyclical activities in vivo through a post-translational mechanism that involves rhythmic phosphorylation of KaiC. Although this post-translational oscillator (PTO) is sufficient for generating rhythms in vitro, the cyanobacterial circadian system in vivo also includes a transcriptional/translational feedback loop (TTFL). The precise roles of the PTO and the TTFL and their interdependence in forming the complete clock system in vivo are unclear. By manipulating wild-type and mutant clock protein expression in vivo, we here show that the cyanobacterial circadian system is dependent upon the biochemical oscillator provided by the PTO and that suppression of the PTO leads to a residual damped (slave) oscillation that results from the TTFL. Mathematical modeling shows that the experimental data are compatible with a mechanism in which the PTO acts as a pacemaker to drive the activity of the TTFL. Moreover, our analyses suggest a mechanism by which the TTFL can feed back into the PTO such that new synthesis of the Kai proteins entrains the core PTO pacemaker. Therefore, the PTO and TTFL appear to have a definite hierarchical interdependency: the PTO is a self-sustained core pacemaker that can oscillate independently of the TTFL, but the TTFL is a slave oscillator that damps when the phosphorylation status of KaiC in the PTO is clamped. The core circadian pacemaker in eukaryotes is thought to be a TTFL, but our results with cyanobacteria have important implications for eukaryotic clock systems in that they can explain how a TTFL could appear to be the core clock when in fact the true pacemaker is an embedded biochemical oscillator.
