The concept of “pharmacogenomics” or “pharmacogenetics” promises to offer the ultimate in personalized medicine, and the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) is one of the most plausible candidates for the application of this approach in the area of hypertension. For the past two decades, genetic variants of the RAS have been tested for association with blood pressure response, but the results have been inconsistent. The problems have been attributed to many issues, but the most fundamental concern is thought to be the statistical power of the studies. Therefore, we have tried to put together a new systematic review using a database search including only recent reports with adequate numbers of subjects, and 11 reports were identified. From the results, we were able to draw conclusions with nearly consistent findings that the conventional genetic variants of the system (i.e., the ACE I/D, AGT M235T, AT1 A1166C, and AT2 variant) are not associated with antihypertensive effects by RAS blockade, at least by one individual SNP. By contrast, significant associations have been reported (by one report each) for AGT rs7079, AT1 haplotype, REN, and ACE2. For these variants, further evaluations and confirmation are anticipated.
