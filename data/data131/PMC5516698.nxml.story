A pontine hemorrhage can evoke several neurological symptoms because the pons contains various nuclei and nerve fibers. Hearing loss can develop as a result of a pontine hemorrhage because there is an auditory conduction pathway in the cochlear nucleus of the pons. However, very few cases of hearing loss caused by pontine lesions have been reported, and there have been no reports of auditory neuropathy that developed following a pontine hemorrhage. Recently we had a patient who experienced a nontraumatic pontine hemorrhage who was diagnosed with auditory neuropathy. The 34-year-old male patient was admitted to the emergency department with sudden alteration of mental status. His brain computed tomographic imaging revealed a hemorrhage in the central pons. He complained of hearing difficulties after his mental status recovered through conservative treatment, but a pure-tone audiogram showed very mild hearing loss in both ears. Further hearing tests using otoacoustic emissions, which showed normal responses, and auditory brainstem responses, which showed no waveforms at maximum stimulus intensity, revealed that his hearing difficulties were caused by auditory neuropathy. This case implies that the threshold of sound detection can be preserved in patients with pontine hemorrhage who complain of hearing difficulties. Auditory neuropathy should be considered as a possible cause of hearing difficulties in these patients and appropriate hearing tests should be performed.
