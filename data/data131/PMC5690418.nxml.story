A challenging case was reported for a patient treated in decubitus position with proton pencil beam scanning. A regular robust plan with the consideration of the uncertainties of translational alignment and range accuracy cannot ensure the target coverage as revealed in two verification computed tomography (CT) scans during the first week of the treatment. The irreproducibility of daily alignment and anatomical variations in such a position is mainly due to patient’s roll. To mitigate the interfractional effect on the target coverage, a novel robust optimization against the patient’s angular setup uncertainties was implemented to improve the plan quality by introducing two artificial CT image sets by rolling the planning CT three degrees in both clockwise and counter-clockwise directions and adding them into robust optimization scenarios, which was shown to be an effective and simple way to mitigate target dose degradation with respect to interfractional variations. This method can be easily generalized and applied to other situations where angular variations in patient’s setup can introduce large dosimetric effects. It is recommended that angularly robust optimization method should be integrated into the treatment planning system as an option particularly for patient’s treatment subject to large angular variations, such as the one in the decubitus position reported here.
