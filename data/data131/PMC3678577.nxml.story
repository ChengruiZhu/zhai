 genes in DNA mismatch repair are important in the pathogenesis of gastrointestinal cancer. Recent studies of normal and alternative splicing suggest that the deleterious effects of missense mutations may in fact be splicing-related when they are located in exonic splicing enhancers (ESEs) or exonic splicing silencers (ESSs). In this study, we used ESE-finder and FAS-ESS software to analyze the potential ESE/ESS motifs of the 114 missense mutations detected in the two genes in East Asian gastrointestinal cancer patients. In addition, we used the SIFT tool to functionally analyze these mutations. The amount of the ESE losses (68) was 51.1% higher than the ESE gains (45) of all the mutations. However, the amount of the ESS gains (27) was 107.7% higher than the ESS losses (13). In total, 56 (49.1%) mutations possessed a potential exonic splicing regulator (ESR) error. Eighty-one mutations (71.1%) were predicted to be deleterious with a lower tolerance index as detected by the Sorting Intolerant from Tolerant (SIFT) tool. Among these, 38 (33.3%) mutations were predicted to be functionally deleterious and possess one potential ESR error, while 18 (15.8%) mutations were predicted to be functionally deleterious and exhibit two potential ESR errors. These may be more likely to affect exon splicing. Our results indicated that there is a strong correlation between missense mutations in
