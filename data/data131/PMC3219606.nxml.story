Genetic architecture is of broad interest in evolutionary biology, plant and animal breeding, and medicine, because it influences both the response to selection and the success of trait mapping. Results from the most rigorously studied genetic systems suggest a similar genetic architecture across all species and traits studied, with many loci of small effect. A few strongly selected traits in domesticated organisms show unusual genetic architecture, for reasons that are unclear. We compare maize inflorescence, flowering, and leaf traits and show that inflorescence traits have distinct genetic architectures characterized by larger effects. Female inflorescences (ears) have larger effects than male inflorescences (tassels) even though the two structures have similar developmental origins. Analysis of pleiotropic loci shows that these larger effects are not inherent features of the underlying polymorphisms. Rather, maize inflorescences appear to be exceptionally labile, with female inflorescences more labile than male inflorescences. These results support the canalization hypothesis, which predicts that rapidly changing traits will have larger effects. We suggest that maize inflorescence traits, and ear traits in particular, have larger effects than flowering or leaf traits as a result of strong directional selection during maize domestication.
