 L., have known anticarcinogenic and anti-inflammatory properties, but high toxicity, poor aqueous solubility and susceptibility to degradation in body fluids are deterrents to their clinical administration. Poly(methyl methacrylate) nanoparticles (PMMA-NPs) are biocompatible and resilient and can entrap hydrophobic drugs. The present investigation is related to solubilizing Curs by incorporating them in these nanoparticles (NPs) and is related to a study comparing the anticarcinogenic effect of drug-loaded NPs with free Cur using lung cancer (A549) cell line. Freshly extracted oleoresins were post loaded in PMMA-NPs prepared using emulsion polymerization. The presence of the three components of oleoresins was confirmed by thin-layer chromatography. The size and morphology of void and loaded NPs were determined by dynamic light scattering, scanning electron microscopy and transmission electron microscopy. The NPs were spherical with diameters of 192.66±5 nm (void) and 199.16±5 nm (loaded). Drug loading and encapsulation efficiency were 6% and 93%, respectively. From the Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy spectra, the characteristic absorption vibration of poly(methyl methacrylate) and the bands at 1,383, 1,233 and 962 cm
