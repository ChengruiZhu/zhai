Genome-wide association study is concerned with the associations between markers and traits of interest so as to identify all the significantly associated markers. In genome-wide association studies, hundreds of thousands of markers are genotyped for several hundreds of individuals. Usually, only a very minor subset of these markers is associated with the trait. Most penalization methods fail when the number of markers is much larger than the sample size. Based on this fact, we have developed an algorithm that proceeds in two stages. In the first stage (screening), we reduced the number of markers via correlation learning to a moderate size. We then used a moderate-scale variable selection method to select variables in the reduced model. Conditional on the selected variables, we repeated the screening procedure and chose another set of variables. In the second stage (estimation), all the above-selected variables are accurately estimated in a multi-locus model. Our approach is simple, accurate in estimation, fast and shows high statistical power of detecting relevant markers on simulated data. We have also used this method to identify relevant genes in real data analysis. We recommend our approach for conducting a multi-locus genome-wide association study.
