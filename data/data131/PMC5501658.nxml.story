The mitochondrion is an organelle floating in the cytoplasm of almost all eukaryotic cells. Its primary function is to generate energy. It contains an independent DNA (mtDNA), which is inherited maternally in many organisms. This DNA is highly susceptible to mutations since it does not possess the robust DNA repair mechanisms proper of the nuclear DNA. Mutations in the mtDNA were associated to several inherited and acquired mitochondrial diseases, including Alzheimer and Parkinson diseases, and cancer. The assessment of the mutation-disease causal link is an onerous task. It requires important laboratory skills/equipment and, often, an animal facility, which are not always available to any laboratory altogether. More and more often, one falls back on software solutions that rely on structural and functional characteristics of proteins to predict the putative harmfulness of a mutation. Many have been implemented and tested on the nuclear proteins, but only a few were finely tuned to the “neglected genome”. Our work not only presents APOGEE, a machine-learning-based predictor that outperforms all existing predictors in reliability and sensitivity, but it makes freely available the APOGEE’s predictions for all the mitochondrial missense mutations in MitImpact.
