The spatial organization of the genome inside the cell nucleus is important in regulating gene expression and in the response to external stimuli. Examples of changing spatial organization are the repositioning of genes outside chromosome territories during the induction of gene expression, and the gathering of active genes at transcription factories (discrete foci enriched in active RNA polymerase). Recent genome-wide mapping of RNA polymerase II has identified its presence at many genes poised for activation, raising the possibility that such genes might associate with poised transcription factories. Using an inducible mammalian gene, urokinase-type plasminogen activator (uPA), and a system in which this gene is poised for expression, we show that uPA associates with poised transcription factories prior to activation. Gene activation induces two independent events: repositioning towards the exterior of its chromosome territory and association with active transcription factories. Surprisingly, genes inside the interior of the chromosome territory prior to activation are less likely to be actively transcribed, suggesting that positioning at the territory interior has a role in gene silencing.
