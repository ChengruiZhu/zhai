The aim of this study was to determine whether anti-angiotensin type 1 receptor antibodies (AT1R-Abs) are related to acute rejection (AR) and kidney graft failure in renal transplantation. We searched electronic databases including MEDLINE, EMBASE, and the ISI Web of Science databases for all studies on the association between anti-angiotensin type 1 receptor antibodies and kidney allograft outcomes updated to November 2016. Reference lists from included articles were also reviewed. The pooled relative risks (RRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were extracted or calculated using a random-effects model. The potential sources of heterogeneity and publication bias were estimated. Nine studies enrolling 1771 subjects were retrieved in the meta-analysis. AT1R-Abs showed significant associations with increased risk of AR (RR = 1.66; 95% CI, 1.23–2.09). In addition, a significant relationship was found between AT1R-Abs and kidney graft failure compared with AR (RR = 3.02; 95% CI, 1.77–4.26). The results were essentially consistent among subgroups stratified by participant characteristics. These results demonstrated that the AT1R-Abs were associated with an elevated risk of kidney allograft outcomes, especially with kidney graft failure. Large-scale studies are still required to further verify these findings.
