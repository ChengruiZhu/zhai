During vaginal hysterectomy, adnexectomy was possible in 90.6% of the cases in which it was indicated (unilateral in 21.8% because of adnexal pathology) and was technically impossible in 9.3%. In 4 patients (1.9%), it was not possible to complete a vaginal hysterectomy, owing to the presence of thick adhesions obliterating the cul-de-sac, to severe endometriosis, or to other unforeseen circumstances. In these few patients with difficult access to the ovaries (2.9% of all VH) or with difficulties in mobilizing the uterus, we resorted to laparoscopy. The pneumoperitoneum was achieved with an insufflation tube inserted via the vagina into the abdominal cavity and packing the vagina. Thus, the risks associated with the insertion of the Veress needle were avoided. In all but 2 patients in whom conversion to laparotomy was necessary, laparoscopy was successfully completed. No major complications occurred. In the retrospective analysis of 509 hysterectomies, we determined that 29% were vaginal, 43% abdominal, and 28% laparoscopic (mostly LAVH). In the following years, LAVH allowed the conversion of a significant number of abdominal or laparoscopic hysterectomies to a vaginal route, showing that the vaginal approach was possible in most of cases.
