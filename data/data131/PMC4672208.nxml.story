 (L., 1758) can be used as a resource for population genetic analyses. Using insect fragments of traffic-killed specimens collected over 15â€‰yr, we determined the most efficient DNA extraction method in relation to the state of the specimens (crushed, fragment, or intact), preservation (dried, airtight, or in ethanol), storage duration, and weight of the sample by assessing the quantity and quality of genomic DNA. A modified cetyltrimethyl ammonium bromide method provided the highest recovery rate of genomic DNA and the largest yield and highest quality of DNA. We further used traffic-killed specimens to evaluate two DNA amplification techniques (quantitative polymerase chain reaction [qPCR] and microsatellites). Both qPCR and microsatellites revealed successful DNA amplification in all degraded specimens or beetle fragments examined. However, relative qPCR concentration and peak height of microsatellites were affected by the state of specimen and storage duration but not by specimen weight. Our investigation demonstrates that degraded remnants of traffic-killed beetle specimens can serve as a source of high-quality genomic DNA, which allows to address conservation genetic issues.
