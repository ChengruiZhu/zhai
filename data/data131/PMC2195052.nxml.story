 It has previously been shown that the site of production of the generator potential in Pacinian corpuscles is the receptor membrane of the non-myelinated ending, and the site of initiation of the nerve impulse, the adjacent (first) Ranvier node. Effects of membrane polarization of these sites were studied in the present work. Nerve ending and first Ranvier node were isolated by dissection, electric activity was recorded from, and polarizing currents were passed through them. All observations were done at steady levels of polarization, seconds after onset of current flow. The following results were obtained: The amount of charge transferred through the excited receptor membrane is a function of the electrical gradients across the membrane. The generator potential in response to equal mechanical stimuli increases with resting potential of the receptor membrane. The refractory state of the generator potential is not affected by polarization. The electrical threshold for impulse firing at the first Ranvier node (measured by the minimal amplitude of generator potential which elicits a nodal impulse) is nearly minimal at normal resting potential of the node. Both, hyperpolarization and depolarization lead to a rise in nodal threshold. For any level of polarization of nodal and receptor membrane, the threshold for production of impulses by adequate (mechanical) stimulation appears determined by the generator potential-stimulus strength relation and by the electrical threshold of the node.
