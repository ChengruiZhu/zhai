More than 180,000 people live with organ transplants in the US. Monitoring the health of the allograft is a critically important component of post-transplant therapy. Recently, we have demonstrated that cell-free DNA (cfDNA) enables diagnosis of post-transplant rejection. In this approach, genotyping of the recipient and the donor together with shotgun sequencing of cfDNA are used to quantify the proportion of donor-derived cfDNA (dd-cfDNA). This approach offers key advantages over the current practice of organ biopsy, which is invasive, costly, and risky. However, the difficulty and cost of establishing a pure reference donor genotype is a major barrier to its widespread clinical implementation. Here, we developed a computational approach that enables an accurate estimation of dd-cfDNA levels without the need for a donor genotype. In addition, we provide a solution of closely related recipients and donors—a scenario which is common in bone marrow and kidney transplants—by accounting for the identity-by-descent between the recipient and the donor. Last, we demonstrate a new application of cfDNA in the noninvasive diagnosis of Graft Versus Host Disease, a serious and difficult-to-diagnose complication of allogeneic bone marrow and stem cell transplantation.
