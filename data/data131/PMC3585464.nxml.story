Diagnostic markers are derived from steady state measurements, but are used to predict the cellular response to therapy. To develop new and better diagnostics, we would like to systematically characterize the relationship between steady state and the response to a given therapeutic. Mathematical models have powerfully complemented empirical studies in this regard, but it remains challenging to employ these models to characterize the effects of steady state. To do so requires a mathematical expression for the steady state, for which no universal method has been developed. Here, we present a method for deriving a mathematical expression for the steady state of a common class of models, those that obey the Law of Mass Action. We show that our method is easy to use and scales well to large models. We then use our method to characterize the relationship between steady state and the sensitivity to the anti-cancer drug candidate, dulanermin. We find that sensitivity to the drug is strongly affected by the concentration of the signaling molecule, procaspase 8, and its inhibitor, Bar. Our work thus demonstrates the utility of analytical studies of the steady state and its relationship to drug sensitivity.
