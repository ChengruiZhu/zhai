 tests were employed to analyze clinical data, which included the association between T-cadherin expression and clinicopathological features and prognosis. The log-rank test was used to examine the impact of T-cadherin expression on the 5-year disease-free survival (DFS) and the 5-year overall survival (OS) of these patients. Kaplan-Meier and Cox regression analyses were introduced to analyze DFS and OS. Compared with the T-cadherin-positive group (58.3, 52.8 and 47.2, respectively; P=0.018, P=0.017, and P=0.047), tumor size >2 cm, grade II and III (Elston-Ellis modification of Bloom-Richardson grading system), and positive lymph node status were significantly more common in the T-cadherin-negative group compared with the T-cadherin-positive group (80.0 vs. 58.3%, 75.7 vs. 52.8% and 67.1 vs. 47.2%, respectively) (P=0.018, P=0.017, and P=0.047). Compared with the T-cadherin-positive group, 5-year DFS and OS levels were significantly lower in the T-cadherin-negative group (Z=6.233, P=0.013; Z=5.366, P=0.021). Multivariate analysis revealed that negative T-cadherin expression was an independent prognostic factor for DFS (P=0.009) and OS (P=0.048). The results of the present study indicated that negative T-cadherin expression indicated a worse prognosis for patients with TNBC.
