 calf liver, calf thymus, and human normal and leukemic lymphatic tissue. DNA from chicken erythrocytes—a DNA presumably metabolically inert—gives a similar picture. DNA's from several sources with a wide range in nitrogen base ratios, prepared independently by different workers using various methods, have given final products in varying yield; these all gave the same x-ray pattern, suggesting that all DNA is in the double-helical configuration. Finally, separation of the DNA molecule into a number of fractions with a varying adenine + thymine:guanine + cytosine ratio, but a constant adenine:thymine and guanine:cytosine ratio, each giving the same x-ray pattern as the original whole molecule, suggests that DNA cannot exist in significant amounts in forms other than the double-helix. X-ray diffraction photographs of sperm heads, extracted nucleoprotamine, calf thymus nuclei and extracted nucleohistone, and of chicken erythrocyte nuclei, are not all as well defined as those given by extracted DNA, but it is clear from the general characteristics of the pattern that much of the DNA bound to protein in these nuclei has the usual helical configuration, and that the double-helical structure of DNA exists in the cell and is not an artifact.
