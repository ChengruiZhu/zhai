Each chromosome is present in two distinct but homologous copies in diploid organisms. To generate haploid gametes suitable for fertilization, these homologous chromosomes must segregate during meiosis. To ensure correct chromosome segregation, homologous chromosomes must align and become connected by inter-homologue crossovers during early meiosis in most taxa including mammals. Defects in these processes result in infertility and aneuploidies in gametes. Alignment of homologous chromosomes and crossover formation entail generation of DNA double-strand breaks and repair of DNA breaks by meiotic recombination. As part of the repair process, single-stranded DNA ends resulting from DNA breaks invade homologous DNA sequences and use them as repair templates. DNA strand invasion events lead to the alignment of homologous chromosomes, and serve as precursors for crossovers. We discovered that meiotic recombination critically depends on the helicase-related minichromosome maintenance domain containing 2 protein (MCMDC2). MCMDC2 likely promotes the formation and/or stabilization of DNA strand invasion events that connect homologous chromosomes. Thus, MCMDC2 is required for DNA breaks to effectively promote alignment of homologous chromosomes. This work reveals a crucial role for MCMDC2 in recombination in mammals, and constitutes an important step in understanding how recombination establishes connections between homologous chromosomes during meiosis.
