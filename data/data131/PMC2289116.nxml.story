Serum-deprived Swiss 3T3 fibroblasts constitutively form stress fibers at their edges. These fibers move centripetally towards the perinuclear region where they disassemble. Serum stimulation causes shortening of fibers in a manner suggesting active actin-myosin-based contraction (Giuliano, K.A. and D.L. Taylor. 1990. Cell Motil. and Cytoskeleton. 16:14-21). To elucidated the role of actin-based gel structure in these movements, we examined the effects of disrupting actin organization with cytochalasin. Serum-deprived fibroblasts were microinjected with rhodamine analogs of actin or myosin II and fiber dynamics were monitored with a multimode light microscope workstation using video- enhanced contrast and fluorescence modes. When cells were perfused with greater than or equal to 3 microM cytochalasin B or 0.5 microM cytochalasin D, formation and transport of stress fibers were reversibly inhibited, and rapid and immediate shortening of existing fibers was induced. Quantification of actin and myosin II fluorescence associated with individual shortening fibers demonstrated that fluorescence per length of fiber increased for both components, suggesting sliding filament contraction. However, there was also a net loss of both actin and myosin II from fibers as they shortened, indicating a self-destructive process. Loss of material from fibers coupled with increased overlap of actin and myosin II remaining in the fibers suggested that contraction could be induced not only by increasing the force exerted by contractile motors, but also by decreasing gel structure through partial solation. Finally, cytochalasin accelerated contraction of actin-myosin-based gels reconstituted from purified proteins in the absence of myosin-based regulation, further supporting solation-contraction coupling as a possible mechanism for modulating cytoplasmic contractility (Taylor, D.L. and M. Fechheimer. 1982. Philos. Trans. R. Soc. Lond. B. Biol. Sci. 299:185-197).
