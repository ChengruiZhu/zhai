Calcineurin inhibitors (CNIs) are frequently given at a reduced dose in combination with mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) to avoid nephrotoxicity, but the optimal reduction in CNI dose has not been established. In this prospective, open-label, multicenter study, liver transplant recipients with chronic renal dysfunction who were administered a CNI-based immunosuppressive regimen were included in the intent-to-treat (ITT) population. The primary endpoint was declination in renal function, which was defined as a â‰¥ 20% decrease in the glomerular filtration rate during the year following regimen adjustment. In the ITT population, renal function declined after regimen adjustment in three patients (7%) in the MMF plus 50% CNI reduction group. Additionally, three of 40 patients (7.5%) in the MMF plus 75% CNI reduction group experienced at least one clinically suspected or biopsy-proven acute rejection. There were no differences between the two groups. The corrected mean improvement in creatinine clearance at week 52 was 6.551 mL/min in the MMF plus 50% CNI reduction group and 6.442 mL/min in the MMF plus at least 75% CNI reduction group. Thus, a regimen of MMF combined with a 50% or at least 70% reduction in CNI dose could improve renal function and was both tolerable and safe.
