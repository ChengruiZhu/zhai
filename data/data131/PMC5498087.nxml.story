The vertical treadmill (VertiRun) is an unresearched, partial weight-bearing exercise mode for lower limb rehabilitation. The user undertakes a “running-like” action whilst body weight is supported by a bench and the limb is drawn downwards against overhanging resistance cables on a vertically hung nonmotorised treadmill. This study sought to describe the kinematics and neuromuscular recruitment during VertiRun exercise in the supine, 40°, and 70° postures. Twenty-one healthy male participants (age, 25±7 years; stature, 1.79±0.07 m; body mass, 77.7±8.8 kg) volunteered for sagittal plane kinematic analysis of the ankle, knee and hip and electromyography of lower limb musculature in all three postures. Results indicated similar kinematic and neuromuscular profiles in the 40° and 70° postures which differed from the supine. Regardless of posture, a basic movement pattern was observed where the hamstrings and gastrocnemius muscles were active to extend the hip, flex the knee, plantarflex the ankle and draw the leg down the treadmill belt in the contact phase. The rectus femoris and tibialis anterior were active to flex the hip and knee, and dorsiflex the ankle to draw the leg upwards during the swing phase. The vasti muscles were not active during VertiRun exercise. The VertiRun demonstrated similar kinematic and neuro-muscular patterns to overground gait, allows workload progression based on effort and posture changes, and is a low-impact exercise mode that could maintain physical fitness without loading injured tissues. This study suggests that the VertiRun could supplement rehabilitation programmes for lower-limb injuries.
