Opportunistic infections usually occur in patients with an immunocompromised state, and can be severe. Cryptoccocal meningitis is a fatal condition if left untreated, and is usually found in such patients. We report the case of an adult patient with cryptoccocal meningitis secondary to intestinal lymphangiectasia. A 30 year old female was admitted to our hospital for meningitis. Biochemical and radiological investigations were performed. A cerebrospinal fluid latex agglutination test showed positive cryptoccocal antigen. In addition, there were features of humoral and cell mediated immunity deficiency (lymphopenia, hypoalbuminemia, hypogammaglobulinemia), with a negative human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) test by enzyme linked immunosorbent assay and polymerase chain reaction. An upper gastroduodenoscopy was performed, which showed multiple lymphangiectasias, and a biopsy confirmed the diagnosis of primary intestinal lymphangiectasia (PIL). The patient was treated with intravenous amphotericin B and oral flucytosine, and the meningitis resolved. PIL should be suspected in patients with cryptoccocal meningitis, combined with humoral and cell mediated immunity with a negative HIV test. The management issues, in addition to antifungal therapy, include nutritional supplements for the protein losing enteropathy.
