Biological modules are inherently context-dependent as the input/output behavior of a module often changes upon connection with other modules. One source of context-dependence is retroactivity, a loading phenomenon by which a downstream system affects the behavior of an upstream system upon interconnection. This fact renders it difficult to predict how modules will behave once connected to each other. In this paper, we propose a general modeling framework for gene transcription networks to accurately predict how retroactivity affects the dynamic behavior of interconnected modules, based on salient physical properties of the same modules in isolation. We illustrate how our framework predicts surprising and counter-intuitive dynamic properties of naturally occurring network structures, which cannot be captured by existing models of the same dimension. We describe implications of our findings on the bottom-up approach to designing synthetic circuits, and on the top-down approach to identifying functional modules in natural networks, revealing trade-offs between robustness to interconnection and dynamic performance. Our framework carries substantial conceptual analogies with electrical network theory based on equivalent representations. We believe that the framework we have proposed, also based on equivalent network representations, can be similarly useful for the analysis and design of biological networks.
