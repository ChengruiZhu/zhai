Global biological responses involve pleiotropic, general components exhibited by many cells/tissues together with cell-specific responses. Typically, such responses are dependent on multiple signaling pathways that integrate different inputs to trigger concerted tissue/cell responses. In studying LIF action in the context of immune-endocrine regulatory interactions, we found that LIF regulates expression of a surprisingly small number of genes. In contrast, the mapping of LIF-activated STAT3 transcription factor recruitment by genome-wide ChIP-chip led to the identification of a much larger set of putative regulatory sites. In view of the cross-talk between cytokine and glucocorticoid (Gc) signaling in response to stress and inflammation, we investigated the contribution of Gc to LIF action. Interestingly, the discrepancy between the number of LIF-regulated genes and LIF-dependent STAT3 genomic targets was partly explained by widespread Gc potentiation of LIF action. We further show requirement on both signaling pathways to elicit a pleiotropic and stereotypic innate cellular defense response, together with cell-specific responses such as antagonism between cytokines and Gc on expression of pituitary POMC. Thus, this stereotypic innate cell defense response is defined by the convergence of pathways activated by the stress and inflammatory systems.
