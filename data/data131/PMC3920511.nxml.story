Ameloblastic carcinoma (AC) is a rare malignant epithelial odontogenic tumor that histologically retains the features of ameloblastic differentiation and exhibits cytological features of malignancy in the primary or recurrent tumor. It may develop within a preexisting ameloblastoma or arise de novo or from an odontogenic cyst. Epidemiological evidence shows that human cancer is generally caused by genotoxic factors, genes involved in the susceptibility of cancer, including those involved in metabolism or detoxification of genotoxic environment and those controlling DNA replication. Nowadays, gene polymorphism has an important role in development of malignant tumor. We report a case series study of ameloblastic carcinoma and ameloblastoma to show the role of PKM2 and MAPK8IP2 polymorphisms in these tumors. The DNA was extracted separately from specimens in paraffin sections of the tumor. Polymorphism of these genes was determined by PCR-RFLP (Polymerase Chain Reaction-Restriction fragment length polymorphism) method. The allele distributions of all samples were in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. The genotype and allele distribution in these genes were not statistically different between patients and controls.
