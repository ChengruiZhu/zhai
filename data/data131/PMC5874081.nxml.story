Plant growth and development is influenced by a variety of external environmental cues. Ambient temperature affects almost all stages of plant development but the underlying molecular mechanisms remain largely unknown. In this paper, the authors show that histone deacetylation, an important chromatin remodeling processes, is essential for eliciting warm temperature-induced growth responses in plants; a process called thermomorphogenesis. The authors identify POWERDRESS, a protein known to interact with HISTONE DEACETYLASE 9, as a novel player essential for thermomorphogenesis in Arabidopsis. Another chromatin remodeling mechanism that is known to play a role in thermal response is the eviction of histone variant H2A.Z containing nucleosomes. Through transcriptome studies and meta-analysis, the authors demonstrate statistical associations between gene regulations conferred through PWR-mediated histone H3 deacetylation and those conferred by histone H2A.Z eviction/incorporation dynamics. This study identifies a novel gene that is essential for thermomorphogenesis and points to a possible link between two seemingly distinct chromatin-remodeling processes in regulating gene expression in plants.
