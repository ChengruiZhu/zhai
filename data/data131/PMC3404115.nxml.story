Understanding how the coding of sensory information changes at different stages of sensory processing remains a fundamental challenge in systems neuroscience. Here we address this question by studying early sensory processing in vestibular pathways of monkeys, a system for which sensory stimuli are relatively easy to describe. Peripheral vestibular afferents detect and encode head motion in space to ensure posture and gaze is accurate and stable during everyday life. In this study, we show that central vestibular neurons nonlinearly integrate their afferent inputs, which helps explain the mechanisms that generate enhanced feature detection in sensory pathways. In addition, our results overturn conventional wisdom that early vestibular processing is linear, revealing a striking boosting nonlinearity that is a hallmark of the first central stage of vestibular processing. Studies from other sensory systems have shown that higher-order neurons can more efficiently detect specific features of sensory input, and that nonlinear transformations can increase this efficiency. We suggest that nonlinear integration of afferent input by central vestibular neurons extends their coding range and facilitates the detection of natural vestibular stimuli.
