This study explored the reliability and validity of a Dutch translation of the 10-item Filial Maturity Measure (FMM) in a sample of Dutch informal caregivers. The FMM was translated with a forward–backward method and completed by 93 informal caregivers (62 % response rate) with a need dependent parent. Dimensionality of the Dutch FMM was examined by principal component and internal consistency analyses. Criterion validity was examined by assessing correlations with filial love, filial autonomy and level of closeness between parent and child. Construct validity was tested by examining associations with the traits openness and agreeableness. In addition, the relationship with state and trait affectivity was explored. After removal of the item “I worry about turning out like my parent”, the original dimensional structure, internal consistency, criterion and construct validity were confirmed. Additional exploration of the relation between the FMM subscales and trait and state affectivity scales demonstrated that filial maturity is at most weakly associated with trait affectivity. Both FMM scales showed a positive partial correlation with negative state affectivity. The Dutch FMM appears to be a reliable and valid instrument for measuring filial maturity of informal caregivers who provide care to their need dependent parent. The (non-)functioning of one item pointed to the necessity to validate the FMM, but also questionnaires in general in different populations.
