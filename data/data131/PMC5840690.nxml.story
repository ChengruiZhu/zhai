Breast cancer suppressor candidate-1 (BCSC-1) is a candidate tumor suppressor gene that was identified recently. Decreased levels of BCSC-1 have been detected in a variety of cancer types in previous studies. Matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-14 is a membrane-type MMP that plays an important role in tumor progression and prognosis. Previous research has indicated that MMP-14 is highly expressed in different cancer types and promotes tumor invasion or metastasis by remodeling the extracellular matrix. However, there have been few reports on BCSC-1 and MMP-14 in human breast cancer in recent years. In the present study, the association of BCSC-1 and MMP-14 with human breast cancer was investigated. The immunohistochemical analysis results revealed reduced expression of BCSC-1 and overexpression of MMP-14 in breast cancer tissues compared with adjacent normal breast tissues. Quantitative polymerase chain reaction and western blot analyses also showed that BCSC-1 was expressed at significantly lower levels, and that MMP-14 was expressed at significantly higher levels in breast cancer tissues compared with healthy breast tissue. Furthermore, decreased expression of BCSC-1 and overexpression of MMP-14 were associated with tumor cellular differentiation, lymph node metastasis and distant metastasis. A correlational analysis between BCSC-1 and MMP-14 was also conducted, and the results indicated a negative correlation between the two. In conclusion, the current findings indicate that BCSC-1 is downregulated, while MMP-14 is overexpressed in human breast cancer. These two genes may play important roles during the process of human breast cancer development.
