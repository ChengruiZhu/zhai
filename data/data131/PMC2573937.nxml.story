Miniature electronic technologies now allow researchers to track a salmon's migration from its birthplace in a river's headwaters in the Rocky Mountains to the North Pacific, opening a window on the mysteries of migration and survival. Surprisingly, outward migrating salmon (smolts) have similar survival during migration down dammed and undammed rivers, challenging widely held notions about factors affecting salmon abundance. Elements of the large-scale POST (Pacific Ocean Shelf Tracking) acoustic telemetry array revealed the migrations. Although salmon smolt survival to the Pacific Ocean was comparable in both the dammed Columbia and undammed Fraser rivers, it was higher in the Columbia once distance or travel time was taken into accountâ€”and higher within the hydropower system than below the dammed section. There is not yet enough evidence to determine whether (1) the Fraser has a problem that reduces salmon survival to that of a heavily dammed river or (2) factors other than dams play a larger, unsuspected role in salmon survival. Wherever future research leads on those questions, the new fish tagging technology has demonstrated itself as a useful tool for obtaining objective scientific data with important value in a number of public policy arenas.
