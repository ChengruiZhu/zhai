 analysis we compared glycaemic control and hypoglycaemia between insulin glargine 300 U/mL (Gla‐300) and glargine 100 U/mL (Gla‐100) administered once daily in people with type 2 diabetes (T2DM) from the EDITION 1 (basal plus mealtime insulin) and EDITION 2 (basal insulin plus oral antihyperglycaemic drugs) trials who were previously receiving twice‐daily insulin. At randomization, 16.9% and 20.0% of people in EDITION 1 and 2, respectively, were receiving twice‐daily basal insulin. Glycated haemoglobin change from baseline to Month 6 was similar over 6 months with Gla‐300 or Gla‐100 (least squares mean difference −0.01%; 95% confidence interval [CI] −0.27 to 0.24] in EDITION 1 and 0.16%; 95% CI −0.25 to 0.57, in EDITION 2). Participants previously receiving twice‐daily insulin in EDITION 1 had a lower risk of confirmed (≤3.9 mmol/L [≤70 mg/dL]) or severe hypoglycaemia with Gla‐300 vs Gla‐100 at night (00:00–05:59 hours), but not at any time (24 hours); in EDITION 2 the risk was reduced at night and any time (24 hours). In conclusion, Gla‐300 provided similar glycaemic control with less hypoglycaemia compared with Gla‐100 in people with T2DM switching from twice‐daily to once‐daily basal insulin.
