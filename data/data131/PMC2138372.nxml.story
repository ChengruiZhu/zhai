 Primary weanling hamster kidney cultures were transformed with the adeno 2-SV40, adeno 3-SV40, and adeno 12-SV40 hybrid viruses and with adenovirus type 12. The transformed cell lines which were established were characterized with respect to morphology, virus and antigen content, and chromosome aberrations. The adeno 2 and adeno 3-SV40 hybrid transformed cells had the morphology and T antigen content characteristic of SV40 transformations; cells transformed by the former hybrid had cytogenetic changes typical of SV40-transformed cells as well. The adeno 12-SV40 transformed cells were similar morphologically to adeno 12-transformed cells, contained both the SV40 and adeno T antigens and demonstrated the karyotypic instability of SV40-transformed cells, indicating that both viral genomes are operative in these cells. Although the results indicate that the SV40 genome in hybrids derived from the moderately or nononcogenic adenoviruses supplies the determinants for most of the characteristics investigated, and perhaps for oncogenesis, evidence was presented which suggests that a portion of a nononcogenic adenovirus genome may be integrated in adeno 2-SV40 transformed cells and directs the synthesis of adenovirus T antigens.
