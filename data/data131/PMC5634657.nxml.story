Cardiovascular disease (CVD) and type 2 diabetes (T2D) are two tightly interrelated diseases that are leading epidemics and causes of deaths around the world. Elucidating the mechanistic connections between the two diseases will offer critical insights for the development of novel therapeutic avenues to target both simultaneously. Because of the challenging complexity of CVD and T2D, involving numerous risk factors, multiple tissues, and multidimensional molecular alterations, few have attempted such an investigation. We herein report a comprehensive and in-depth data-driven assessment of the shared mechanisms between CVD and T2D by integrating genomics data from diverse human populations including African Americans, Caucasian Americans, and Hispanic Americans with tissue-specific functional genomics information. We identified shared pathways and gene networks informed by CVD and T2D genetic risks across populations, confirming the importance of well-established processes, as well as unraveling previously under-appreciated processes such as extracellular matrix, branched-chain amino acid metabolism, and neuronal system for both diseases. Further incorporation of tissue-specific regulatory networks pinpointed potential key regulators that orchestrate the biological processes shared between the two diseases, which were cross-validated using cell culture and mouse models. This study suggests potential new therapeutic targets that warrant further investigation for both CVD and T2D.
