nodules, cysts, which might result in permanent scars. Acne vulgaris commonly
involve adolescents and young age groups. Active acne vulgaris is usually
associated with several complications like hyper or hypopigmentation, scar

and safety of local and systemic agents in the treatment of active acne
vulgaris. Superficial chemical peeling is a skin-wounding procedure which might
cause some potentially undesirable adverse events. This study was conducted to
review the efficacy and safety of superficial chemical peeling in the treatment
of active acne vulgaris. It is a structured review of an earlier seven articles
meeting the inclusion and exclusion criteria. The clinical assessments were
based on pretreatment and post-treatment comparisons and the role of superficial
chemical peeling in reduction of papules, pustules and comedones in active acne
vulgaris. This study showed that almost all patients tolerated well the chemical
peeling procedures despite a mild discomfort, burning, irritation and erythema
have been reported; also the incidence of major adverse events was very low and
easily manageable. In conclusion, chemical peeling with glycolic acid is a
well-tolerated and safe treatment modality in active acne vulgaris while
salicylic acid peels is a more convenient for treatment of darker skin patients
and it showed significant and earlier improvement than glycolic acid
