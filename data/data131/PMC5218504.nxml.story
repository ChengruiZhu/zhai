The deconstruction of complex carbohydrates (e.g., cellulose, chitin), mostly by microbes, releases short metabolizable oligosaccharides to the environment. This contributes to the functioning of an ecosystem and is essential for global carbon cycling. Carbohydrate degradation requires the production of carbohydrate active enzymes (CAZymes). Among these, GH are the most abundant enzymes to break down polysaccharides into smaller products. However, not all the microbes have genes for all the glycoside hydrolases (GH). In addition, microbial communities are dynamic assemblages and display important spatio-temporal variations. Thus, two major questions are, which microbes are associated with GH genes and which are involved in carbohydrate processing across environments. The bioinformatic challenge is therefore to collect enough metagenomic datasets and to reanalyze microbiomes in the light of GH genes. Here, we created a custom bioinformatic pipeline aimed at identifying sequences for GH in 1,934 sequenced microbiomes derived from 13 broadly defined ecosystems, including terrestrial and marine ecosystems as well as human and animal associated microbiomes. We linked changes in microbial community composition and functional potential for carbohydrate processing across environments. Our results suggest that a relatively small number of bacterial genera (i.e., the potential degraders), with increased number of GH genes target the substrates expected in their environment. These degraders display mostly conserved GH content across microbiomes. In each ecosystem however, the functional redundancy among potential degraders allows for slightly distinct communities with similar functional potential. Globally, linking variations of microbial community structure and function, across ecosystems, provides insight into how microbial communities may adjust to the supply of carbohydrates. In the future, this will help predict how change in microbial community composition, in response to environmental perturbation (e.g., global change), can affect the functional potential of microbial communities.
