Both cholesterol levels and the use of statins have been described to influence the development and prognosis of prostate cancer (PC). In this retrospective, cross-sectional analysis of consecutive cases from a tertiary referral center we evaluated an association between hypercholesterolemia (≥5.0mmol/l), the use of statins, and advanced/aggressive PC in 767 men with histologically confirmed, clinically localized PC awaiting radical prostatectomy. We found that patients with HCE (n=287, 37.4%) had a significantly higher incidence of poorly differentiated PC (Gleason score ≥7b, 81.1% vs. 4.9%), advanced local tumor stage (≥pT3, 57.7% vs. 22.2%), and nodal involvement (19.8% vs. 1.6%). Multivariate logistic regression analysis identified hypercholesterolemia as a risk factor for aggressive and/or advanced PC (OR 2.01, p<0.001) whereas statin intake showed an odds ratio of 0.49 (p=0.005) indicating a negative association with high-risk PC. Despite a limited number of patients using statins (~9.5%), adjusted and weighed multivariate logistic regression models revealed that preoperative hypercholesterolemia is associated with a diagnosis of high-risk PC which is negatively influenced by statin intake.
