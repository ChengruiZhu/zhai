Diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma (DIPG) is a devastating brain tumor, with a median survival of less than one year. Due to enormous difficulties in the acquisition of DIPG specimens and the sophisticated technique required to perform brainstem orthotopic injection, only a handful of DIPG pre-clinical models are available. In this study, we successfully established eight patient-derived DIPG cell lines, mostly derived from treatment-na√Øve surgery or biopsy specimens. These patient-derived cell lines can be stably passaged in serum-free neural stem cell media and displayed distinct morphologies, growth rates and chromosome abnormalities. In addition, these cells retained genomic hallmarks identical to original human DIPG tumors. Notably, expression of several neural stem cell lineage markers was observed in DIPG cell lines. Moreover, three out of eight cell lines can form orthotopic tumors in mouse brainstem by stereotactic injection and these tumors faithfully represented the characteristics of human DIPG by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and histopathological staining. Taken together, we established DIPG pre-clinical models resembling human DIPG and they provided a valuable resource for future biological and therapeutic studies.
