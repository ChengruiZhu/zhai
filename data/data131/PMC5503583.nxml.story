Previous studies have shown that focused ultrasound (FUS) combined with systematic administration of microbubbles (MBs) can open the blood brain barrier (BBB) locally, transiently and reversibly. However, because of the micro size diameters, MBs are restricted in the intravascular space and cannot extravasate into diseased sites through the opened BBB. In this study, we fabricated one kind of nanoscale droplets which consisted of encapsulated liquid perfluoropentane cores and poly (ethyleneglycol) - poly (lactide-co-glycolic acid) shells. The nanodroplets had the capacity to realize liquid to gas phase shift under FUS. Significant extravasation of Evan's blue appeared when acoustic pressure reached 1.0 MPa. Intracerebral hemorrhages and erythrocyte extravasations were observed when the pressure was increased to 1.5 MPa. Prolonged sonication duration could enhance the level of BBB opening and broaden the time window simultaneously. Furthermore, compared with MBs, the distribution of EB extravasation was firmly confined within narrow region in the center of focal zone, suggesting the site of FUS induced BBB opening could be controlled with high precision by this procedure. Our results show the feasibility of serving PEGylated PLGA-based phase shift nanodroplet as an effective alternative mediating agent for FUS induced BBB opening.
