) Cross-idiotypic specificity is closely correlated with cross-combining specificity; the converse is not true. This is illustrated here with three groups of mouse myeloma immunoglobulin, each specific for α(1 → 3) dextran, α(1 →6) dextran, β(2 → 1) or β(2 → 6) levan. If a given anti-idiotypic serum cross-reacted with several myeloma proteins, they always had similar combining specificity. Thus the three proteins, J558, MOPC 104E, and UPC 102, which cross-react with anti-J558 have combining specificity for α(1 → 3) dextran; cross-reacting W3082, UPC 61, and Y5476 have specificity for levan; and cross-reacting W3129 and W3434 have specificity for α(1 → 6) dextran. This extends previous studies with proteins specific for phosphorylcholine (7) or γ-globulin (8). As expected, the converse is not true, for proteins may have combining specificity for α(1 → 6) dextran e.g. QUPC 52, or levan e.g. J606, UPC 10 and yet not carry the above-mentioned reference idiotypes. The correlation between cross-idiotypic and combining specificity breaks down when idiotypic determinants which are not modifiable by ligand are studied. The implications of this are pointed out since most investigations deal with ligand-nonmodifiable determinants.
