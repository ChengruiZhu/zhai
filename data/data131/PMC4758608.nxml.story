Many regions of the mammalian brain exhibit oscillations in electrical activity. In rats, the 5–12 Hz theta rhythm is present in the hippocampus and in diverse areas of the cerebral cortex. What is the function of this rhythm? One proposal is that the exchange of information between two brain regions is facilitated whenever their respective oscillations are coherent. To test this idea, we ask whether theta oscillation in the hippocampus, a crucial memory structure located deep in the brain, is coherent with the rat’s rhythm of moving its whiskers and sensing the physical environment with them. We acquired hippocampal local field potentials (LFP)—extracellular voltage fluctuations within a small volume—while rats classified textures using cyclical whisker motion (“whisking”). At the moment of texture palpation, coherence between whisking and hippocampal theta oscillations increased by nearly 50%. At the same time, neuronal firing in sensory cortex became more phase-locked to the hippocampal theta oscillations. Rats identified the texture more rapidly and with lower error likelihood on trials characterized by an increase in hippocampal theta-whisking coherence during texture palpation. These results suggest that, as rats collect touch signals, enhanced coherence between the whisking rhythm, sensory cortex, and hippocampal LFP facilitates the integration of sensory information into memory and decision-making centers in the brain.
