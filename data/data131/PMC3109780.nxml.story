The knowledge of etiology and antibiotic resistance pattern of the organisms causing urinary tract infection is essential. This study was taken up to determine the presentation and risk factors associated with community-acquired urinary tract infection (CA-UTI). The distribution of bacterial strains isolated from these patients and their resistance pattern were also studied. This multidisciplinary prospective observational study was conducted in M. S. Ramaiah Hospital, Bangalore, between January and December, 2008. Patients who had CA-UTI confirmed by positive urine culture reports were included in the study. Statistical analysis was done using the SPSS version 16. Symptomatology and others risk factors for CA-UTI were studied in these patients and the causative organisms and their resistance patterns were recorded. Of the total 510 patients included, 57% belonged to the elderly age group (50â€“79 years). Fever and dysuria were the most common clinical presentation, but were not specific in predicting CA-UTI. Escherichia coli (66.9%) was the most common organism causing CA-UTIs with extended spectrum beta lactamase (ESBL) resistance seen in nearly two-thirds of these cases (42.2%). The organisms recorded least resistance against carbapenems (3.9%). A high resistance rate was seen for fluoroquinolones (74.1%). In conclusion, a high rate of ESBL-positive organisms and their resistance to commonly used antibiotics brings a concern for future options in treating these conditions.
