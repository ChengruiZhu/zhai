Among the 64 MM patients, 34 (53 %) had at least one abnormal CMR finding: 18 (28 %) demonstrated an impaired left ventricular ejection-fraction (LV-EF <60 %), 14 (22 %) had unexplained LV hypertrophy and 21 (33 %) were LGE-positive. Compared to controls, MM patients showed significantly higher maximal wall thickness (10 ± 3 vs. 8 ± 2 mm, p = 0.005) and concentricity (LV mass to end-diastolic volume: 0.84 ± 0.27 vs. 0.67 ± 0.11, p < 0.0001) with frequent presence of non-ischemic LGE (30 % vs. 0 %, p = 0.001). CPEO/KSS showed a predominantly intramural pattern of LGE mostly confined to the basal LV inferolateral wall (8/10; 80 %) in addition to a tendency toward concentric remodelling. MELAS/-like patients showed the highest frequency of cardiac disease (in 10/11 (91 %)), a mostly concentric LV hypertrophy (6/9; 67 %) with or without LV systolic dysfunction and a predominantly focal, patchy LGE equally distributed among LV segments (8/11; 73 %). Patients with MERRF and non-specific MM had no particular findings. Pathological CMR findings indicating cardiac involvement were detected significantly more often than pathological ECG results or elevated cardiac serum biomarkers (34 (53 %) vs. 18 (28 %) vs. 21 (33 %); p = 0.008).
