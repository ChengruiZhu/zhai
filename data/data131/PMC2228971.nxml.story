Cultured sensory neurons from nodose ganglia were investigated with whole-cell patch-clamp techniques and single-channel recordings to characterize the A current. Membrane depolarization from -40 mV holding potential activated the delayed rectifier current (IK) at potentials positive to -30 mV; this current had a sigmoidal time course and showed little or no inactivation. In most neurons, the A current was completely inactivated at the -40 mV holding potential and required hyperpolarization to remove the inactivation; the A current was isolated by subtracting the IK evoked by depolarizations from -40 mV from the total outward current evoked by depolarizations from -90 mV. The decay of the A current on several neurons had complex kinetics and was fit by the sum of three exponentials whose time constants were 10- 40 ms, 100-350 ms, and 1-3 s. At the single-channel level we found that one class of channel underlies the A current. The conductance of A channels varied with the square root of the external K concentration: it was 22 pS when exposed to 5.4 mM K externally, the increased to 40 pS when exposed to 140 mM K externally. A channels activated rapidly upon depolarization and the latency to first opening decreased with depolarization. The open time distributions followed a single exponential and the mean open time increased with depolarization. A channels inactivate in three different modes: some A channels inactivated with little reopening and gave rise to ensemble averages that decayed in 10-40 ms; other A channels opened and closed three to four times before inactivating and gave rise to ensemble averages that decayed in 100-350 ms; still other A channels opened and closed several hundred times and required seconds to inactivate. Channels gating in all three modes contributed to the macroscopic A current from the whole cell, but their relative contribution differed among neurons. In addition, A channels could go directly from the closed, or resting, state to the inactivated state without opening, and the probability for channels inactivating in this way was greater at less depolarized voltages. In addition, a few A channels appeared to go reversibly from a mode where inactivation occurred rapidly to a slow mode of inactivation.
