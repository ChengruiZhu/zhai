Apoptosis protease activating factor-1 (Apaf-1) and death-associated protein kinase (DAPK) are p53 pathway-related genes that play significant roles in the activation of caspases, which are involved in mitochondrial-mediated apoptosis. The present study aimed to confirm the role of hyper-methylation of the Apaf-1 and DAPK gene promoter regions in oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) and the effect of the demethylation drug, 5-aza-2â€²-deoxycytidine (DAC). mRNA from 53 OSCC samples, 23 normal oral mucosa samples and Tca8113 human tongue carcinoma cell lines was detected using semi-quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). The DNA from each sample was analyzed using methylation-specific PCR (MSP). The Tca8113 cells were demethylated using DAC and the demethylation and re-expression of Apaf-1 and DAPK were analyzed. The Apaf-1 and DAPK mRNA expression index was decreased in 51 (96.23%) and 50 (94.34%) cases, respectively, in the tumor tissues. Hypermethylation of the Apaf-1 and DAPK promoter regions was detected in 46 (86.79%) and 38 (71.69%) cases, respectively. Promoter hypermethylation of the two genes correlated with a decreased mRNA expression in the tumor tissues. Subsequent to being treated with DAC, Apaf-1 and DAPK were demethylated and re-expressed in the Tca8113 cells. Apaf-1 and DAPK promoter hypermethylation may be associated with low gene expression in OSCC. Furthermore, a loss of Apaf-1 and DAPK expression may recover following demethylation. The data provide evidence that methylation exists in OSCC and may play a role in the development of this disease.
