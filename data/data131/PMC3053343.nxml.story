The characteristics of the diverse cell types in multicellular organisms result from differential gene expression that is dependent on the level of DNA packaging. Genes that are essential for the function of the cell are expressed; while unessential genes, and DNA elements (transposons or “jumping genes”) that can move from one position to another within a genome and potentially cause deleterious mutations, are repressed. The mechanisms evolved in eukaryotes to avoid unwanted gene expression and transposon movement include DNA methylation and specific combinations of post translational modifications (PTMs) of the histones that package DNA. Here we show that the SUVR4 enzyme binds the signaling protein ubiquitin and that ubiquitin enables the enzyme to trimethylate lysine 9 (H3K9me3) of histone H3. In contrast to other reports demonstrating an activating role on expressed genes, we show that H3K9me3 has a locus-specific repressive effect on the expression of transposons. The specificity is maintained by the communication with other PTMs on transposons and euchromatic genes, which has a stimulating or repressing effect on enzyme activity, respectively. Our results demonstrate how repression of transcription can be restricted to specific targets and demonstrate that this repression involves a context-dependent read-out of different PTMs.
