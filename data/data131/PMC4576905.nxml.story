Doped ZnS quantum dots (QDs) have a longer dopant emission lifetime and potentially lower cytotoxicity compared to other doped QDs. The liver is the key organ for clearance and detoxification of xenobiotics by phagocytosis and metabolism. The present study was designed to synthesize and evaluate the hepatotoxicity of Mn-doped ZnS QDs and their polyethylene glycol-coated counterparts (1 mg/kg and 5 mg/kg) in mice. The results demonstrated that daily injection of Mn-doped ZnS QDs and polyethylene glycol-coated QDs via tail vein for 7 days did not influence body weight, relative liver weight, serum aminotransferases (alanine aminotransferase and aspartate aminotransferase), the levels of antioxidant enzymes (catalase, glutathione peroxidase, and superoxide dismutase), or malondialdehyde in the liver. Analysis of hepatocyte ultrastructure showed that Mn-doped ZnS QDs and polyethylene glycol-coated QDs mainly accumulated in mitochondria at 24 hours after repeated intravenous injection. No damage to cell nuclei or mitochondria was observed with either of the QDs. Our results indicate that Mn-doped ZnS QDs did not cause obvious damage to the liver. This study will assist in the development of Mn-doped ZnS QDs-based bioimaging and biomedical applications in the future.
