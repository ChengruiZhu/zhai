Contrast enhancement of glioblastomas (GBM) is caused by the decrease in relaxation time, T1. Here, we demonstrate that the quantitative measurement of T1 (qT1) discovers a subtle enhancement in GBM patients that is invisible in standard MRI. We assessed the volume change of this “cloudy” enhancement during radio‐chemotherapy and its impact on patients’ progression‐free survival (PFS). We enrolled 18 GBM patients in this observational, prospective cohort study and measured 3T‐MRI pre‐ and post contrast agent with standard T1‐weighted (T1w) and with sequences to quantify T1 before radiation, and at 6‐week intervals during radio‐chemotherapy. We measured contrast enhancement by subtracting pre from post contrast contrast images, yielding relative signal increase ∆T1w and relative T1 shortening ∆qT1. On ∆qT1, we identified a solid and a cloudy‐enhancing compartment and evaluated the impact of their therapy‐related volume change upon PFS. In ∆qT1 maps cloudy‐enhancing compartments were found in all but two patients at baseline and in all patients during therapy. The qT1 decrease in the cloudy‐enhancing compartment post contrast was 21.64% versus 1.96% in the contralateral control tissue (
