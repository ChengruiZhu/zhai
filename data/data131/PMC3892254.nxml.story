Objective: The aim of this study is to analyze subjectively, using the SWAL-QOL questionnaire, swallowing dysfunction and associated factors after treatment with radiotherapy and chemotherapy in patients treated for head and neck cancer. 
Material and Methods: This is a cross-sectional study, based on the selection of patients with tumors of the head and neck area, treated with radiotherapy with or without chemotherapy during the years 2000 to 2006 at the Oncology Institute of Juiz de Fora. The data were analyzed using SPSS 15.0 software, and were evaluated using the chi-square test to compare differences in proportions between groups. The statistical significance level was set at 5%.
Results: It was observed that with respect to foods of solid consistency, there was a statistically significant difference for mouth tumors (p<0.01), with a tendency in this group to use softer foods, easier to chew (stews, boiled vegetables, creamy soups, canned fruit). With reference to the domains of the SWAL-QOL, the location of the tumor in the mouth was statistically associated with the lowest quality of life in the symptoms domain (p<0.05). The female gender variable was associated with the lowest perceived quality of life in several domains, namely swallowing (p=0.02); fatigue (p=0.008); symptoms (p=0.009). Age (split below and above 60 years) was not associated with differences in perceived quality of life in any domain. 
Conclusion: Tumor in the mouth and the total dose of radiation in the superior fossa were associated with the lowest quality of life in the symptoms domain. The female gender variable was associated with the lowest perceived quality of life in several domains This study shows that speech therapy should maintain a presence in the teams, to then guide the rehabilitation of organic dysphonia and mechanical dysphagia possibly afflicting patients after cancer treatment with radiation therapy and chemotherapy.
