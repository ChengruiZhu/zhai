Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a growing burden on society, without a cure in sight. Pathological high neuronal activity and excitability is an increasingly observed phenomenon in early stage AD. Its exact role in the disease process is unclear, but it may form an interesting therapeutic target. However, although brain dynamics can be influenced in many ways, the highly complex nature of the brain makes it difficult to predict what approach will be most effective. To test our hypothesis that neuronal hyperactivity can be countered effectively by altering neuronal excitability levels, we examined various strategies aimed at preserving brain network integrity in a computational AD model of the human brain. Of these strategies, a scenario involving stimulation of excitatory neurons extends the period with normal network function most successfully. The results of this ‘virtual trial’ suggest that network effects of pathological neuronal activity can be opposed by selective altering of neuronal excitability levels. In general, this approach can explore therapeutic effects aimed at preserving or restoring brain network integrity, and thereby contribute to selecting promising interventions for future clinical trials in AD.
