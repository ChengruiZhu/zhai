 infection have been tested as therapeutic postexposure vaccines. We recently described two pools of mycobacterial proteins with this activity, and here we describe further studies in which four of these proteins (Rv1738, Rv2032, Rv3130, and Rv3841) were generated as a fusion polypeptide and then delivered in a novel yeast-based platform (Tarmogen) which itself has immunostimulatory properties, including activation of Toll-like receptors. This platform can deliver antigens into both the class I and class II antigen presentation pathways and stimulate strong Th1 and Th17 responses. In mice this fusion vaccine, designated GI-19007, was immunogenic and elicited strong gamma interferon (IFN-Î³) and interleukin-17 (IL-17) responses; despite this, they displayed minimal prophylactic activity in mice that were subsequently infected with a virulent clinical strain. In contrast, in a therapeutic model in the guinea pig, GI-19007 significantly reduced the lung bacterial load and reduced lung pathology, particularly in terms of secondary lesion development, while significantly improving survival in one-third of these animals. In further studies in which guinea pigs were vaccinated with BCG before challenge, therapeutic vaccination with GI-19007 initially improved survival versus that of animals given BCG alone, although this protective effect was gradually lost at around 400 days after challenge. Given its apparent ability to substantially limit bacterial dissemination within and from the lungs, GI-19007 potentially can be used to limit lung damage as well as facilitating chemotherapeutic regimens in infected individuals.
