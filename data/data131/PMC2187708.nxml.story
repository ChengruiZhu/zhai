Among murine class II major histocompatibility complex (MHC)-restricted cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) clones specific for type A influenza virus, we have identified both noncytolytic clones and clones exhibiting H-2 I region-restricted cytolytic activity. After appropriate antigenic stimulation, both cytolytic and noncytolytic clones proliferated in the absence of exogenous interleukin 2. All of the clones possess the Thy-1.2+, Lyt-1+2-, L3T4+ phenotype. The class II MHC restriction of viral recognition by the CTL clones was mapped by proliferation using recombinant mouse strains and by inhibition of cytotoxic activity with monoclonal antibodies directed to class II MHC products and L3T4a. The restriction specificity of two CTL clones was unambiguously assigned to the E beta d chain by using L cell transfectant lines expressing E alpha kE beta d or E alpha kE beta k gene products. Analysis of the viral specificity of the cloned lines revealed subtype-specific and crossreactive patterns of viral antigen recognition; the pattern of viral antigen specificity exhibited by each clone in proliferation and cell-mediated cytotoxicity was identical. Each CTL clone also demonstrated antigen-dependent release of helper factor(s) that promoted in vitro primary anti-SRBC responses. Finally, the cytotoxic effector function of the class II MHC-restricted CTL clones was mediated by direct lysis of virus-infected cells, and not by secretion of a cytolytic lymphokine.
