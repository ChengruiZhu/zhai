Infection occurred in 24 of 172 patients (13.95%). Out of 172 patients, 8 patients (4.65%) had superficial wound infection at the sternotomy site, 5 patients (2.9%) had central venous catheter infection, 4 patients (2.32%) had pneumonia, 9 patients (5.23%) had bacteremia, one patient (0.58%) had mediastinitis, one (0.58%) had harvest surgical site infection, one (0.58%) had urinary tract infection, and another one patient (0.58%) had other major infection. The mortality rate was 25% among the patients with infection and 3.48% among all patients who underwent cardiac surgery compared with 5.4% of patients who did not develop early postoperative infection after cardiac surgery. Culture results demonstrated equal frequencies of gram-positive cocci and gram-negative bacteria. A backward stepwise multivariable logistic regression model analysis identified diabetes mellitus (OR 5.92, CI 1.56 to 22.42, p = 0.009), duration of mechanical ventilation (OR 1.30, CI 1.005 to 1.69, p = 0.046), development of severe complications in the CICU (OR 18.66, CI 3.36 to 103.61, p = 0.001) and re-admission to the CVICU (OR 8.59, CI 2.02 to 36.45, p = 0.004) as independent risk factors associated with development of nosocomial infection after cardiac surgery.
