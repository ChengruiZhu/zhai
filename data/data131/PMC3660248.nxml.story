As an important safeguard against autoimmunity, T cells bearing autoreactive T cell antigen receptors are eliminated during their development in the thymus, a process known as negative selection. Although much is known about the molecular events involved in negative selection, surprisingly little is known about the dynamic aspects of the process. Here we examine a synchronized population of developing T cells (thymocytes) undergoing negative selection within three-dimensional living thymic tissue. We show that the initial encounter with negative selecting ligands results in migratory arrest, but in spite of this synchronous early response, individual thymocytes then undergo delayed and asynchronous entry into the death program between 2 and 12 hours thereafter. Using time-lapse two-photon imaging, we reveal that thymocyte death and the clearance of the dead cells invariably occur together, with many thymocytes already engulfed by a macrophage before the cell death-related changes in chromatin and membrane permeability are evident. These data provide a timeline of the major events during negative selection, and suggest close coupling between thymocyte death and clearance by macrophages.
