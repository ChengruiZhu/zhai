Previous studies have suggested that changes in sex hormone receptor expression may be associated with the initiation and progression of prostate cancer (PCa). Therefore, the present study aimed to investigate the association and possible pathways between two sex hormone receptors and PCa by measuring the expression levels of the androgen receptor (AR) and the estrogen receptor subtypes alpha (ERα) and beta (ERβ) in prostatic cancer PC-3 cell lines. The pcDNA3.1-hERβ plasmid was transfected into PC-3 cell lines. The expression levels of AR, ERα and ERβ were detected at the mRNA level by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and quantitative PCR (qPCR). The results demonstrated that the expression levels of AR, ERβ and ERα were downregulated to different degrees: ERβ test group vs. PC-3 cell group (P=0.000; 95% confidence interval: 0.9803–1.6331). ERβ and AR expression was detected continuously in the PC-3 cells, but the expression of ERα was not. AR expression levels exhibited an upward trend whilst the expression of ERβ demonstrated a marked downward trend. There is a correlation between the expression levels of ERβ and the incidence of PCa, and ERβ may inhibit the growth of PC-3 cell lines by regulating the expression levels of AR. ERβ may provide a novel target for PCa therapies.
