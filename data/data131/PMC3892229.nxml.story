Florid cemento-osseous dysplasia (FCOD) has been described as a condition that characteristically affects the jaws of middle-aged black women. This condition has also been classified as gigantiform cementoma, chronic sclerosing osteomyelitis, sclerosing osteitis, multiple estenosis and sclerotic cemental masses. It usually exhibits as multiple radiopaque cementum-like masses distributed throughout the jaws. Radiographically, FCOD appears as dense, lobulated masses, often symmetrically located in various regions of the jaws. Computed tomography, because of its ability to give axial, sagittal, and frontal views, is useful in the evaluation of these lesions. 
This article reports the case of a 45-year-old white man who was diagnosed with FCOD on the basis of clinical, radiographic, biochemical and histological findings. 
It is of major importance to realize that all dentists have a unique opportunity as well as ethical obligation to assist in the struggle against wrong dental treatments that might save patients dental health. This case report illustrates the point that periapical radiolucencies may represent benign fibro-osseous lesions that may be overlooked or result in unnecessary endodontic treatment.
