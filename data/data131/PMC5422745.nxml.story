Intracranial glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) constitutes the most frequent and unfortunately aggressive primary central nervous system malignancy. Despite the high tendency of these tumors to show local relapse within the brain after primary therapy, dissemination into the spinal axis is an infrequent event. If spinal metastases occur they are leptomeningeal in the vast majority of cases and always in the context of intracranial progressive disease. Spinal intramedullary metastases of intracranial GBM have rarely been described to date. We report the unique case of a young woman with subacute progressive paraparesis due to spinal intramedullary metastases of a temporal lobe GBM despite the remarkable absence of intracranial tumor relapse. The patient had undergone gross total resection of a left temporal GBM in contact with the ventricles and cisternal space followed by radio- and chemotherapy 13 months before. At the moment of diagnosis of spinal intramedullary metastases, there were no signs of intracranial tumor recurrence as revealed by MRI scans. Since a high level of suspicion may be needed to detect this rare evolution of intracranial GBM and other differential diagnoses must be ruled out at presentation, we discuss the important features of this case regarding clinical manifestation, diagnosis, surgery, and management. Furthermore, we mention possible factors that may have contributed to the development of these metastases in the context of intracranial remission.
