The study involved preparation of artificial saliva using Shellis formula. A total 45 standardized samples of the material (GC RELINE™) were prepared in disk form (15 mm in diameter and 2 mm in thickness). The study was divided into three groups with storage in Control (distilled water), Shellis artificial saliva, and 5.25% sodium hypochlorite. Samples were dried in a desiccator and weighed in the analytical balance to measure the initial weight (mg/cm2) of the disks (W1). The first groups (15 samples) were placed in 30 ml distilled water (Group A) at 37ºC, second group 30 ml of artificial saliva (Group B) and third group in 5.25% sodium hypochlorite (Group C). Disks were removed from disinfectant after 5 min and placed in 30 ml distilled water. On days 4, 7, 11, and 15, all samples were removed from their containers and reweighed to measure the weight (mg/cm2) of the disks after sorption (W2). The solubility was measured by placing the disks back in the desiccator after each sorption cycle and drying them to constant weight in the desiccator. These values were weight after desiccation (W3). Water sorption and solubility was calculated: 1. Sorption (mg/cm2) = (W2−W1)/Surface area 2. Solubility (mg/cm2) = (W1−W3)/Surface area.
