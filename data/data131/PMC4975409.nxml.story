Simulations generated by computers are often an effective way to study the dynamics of cardiac cells. A crucial component in these studies is the mathematical model that describes the electrical signal across the cells. The models vary from detailed, with numerous components, to simplified, with a minimal set of variables. While the detailed models contain more information, they are slower computationally. In this study we develop physiologically accurate computational human atrial models by fitting parameters of a detailed and of a simplified model to clinical data for five human patients. For both models, our fitting procedure generated parameter sets that accurately reproduced clinical data, but differed markedly from published sets and between patients, emphasizing the need for patient-specific adjustment. Both models were also capable of producing two-dimensional spiral wave dynamics for each patient. While the spiral waves differed significantly between patients, the models produced similar results for each case. These results show that simplified, computationally efficient models are an attractive choice for simulations of human atrial electrophysiology. This study motivates the development and validation of patient-specific model-based studies to target therapy.
