DNA is constantly damaged by normal cellular metabolism, for example production of reactive oxygen species, or from exposure to external DNA damaging sources, such as radiation from the sun or chemicals in the environment. These genotoxic agents create thousands of single-strand breaks/cell/day in the human body. An essential DNA repair protein known as polynucleotide kinase/phosphatase (PNKP) makes sure the single-strand breaks have 5’ phosphate and 3’ hydroxyl ends suitable for healing by DNA ligase. Mutations that reduce PNKP activity cause a devastating neurological disease but surprisingly not cancer, suggesting that other DNA repair mechanisms step into the breach in dividing PNKP-deficient cells. One popular candidate was homology-directed repair (HDR) of replication forks that collapse at single-strand breaks, but the crucial HDR protein Rad51 was found to be non-essential in PNKP-deficient cells of fission yeast. In this study, Sanchez and Russell revive the HDR model by showing that SSBs in PNKP-deficient cells are repaired by a variant HDR mechanism that bypasses the requirement for Rad51. Notably, Mus81 endonuclease that resolves sister chromatid recombination structures formed during HDR of collapsed replication forks was found to be essential in PNKP-deficient cells.
