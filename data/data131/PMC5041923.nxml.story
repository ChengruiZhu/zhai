Many studies have investigated the association between single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs6983267 and the risk of prostate cancer. However, results of these studies are inconsistent. Therefore, we summarised available data and performed a meta-analysis to determine this association. Relevant articles were identified by searching the PubMed, Web of Science and Embase database. Odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated using random effects model. We used dominant model (GG + TG vs TT), recessive model (GG vs TG + TT) and additive model (GG +TT vs TG) to determine the association between the rs6983267 polymorphism and risk of prostate cancer. Summary, 9 studies involving 8726 participants were included in this meta-analysis. Overall, though no association was observed between the rs6983267 polymorphism and risk of prostate cancer, subgroup analysis according to ethnicity showed a significant association between the rs6983267 polymorphism and risk of prostate cancer among white European men [recessive model: GG vs TG + TT, OR=1.21, (95% CI: 1.03, 1.42), P=0.02]. Our results indicate that the GG genotype of the rs6983267 polymorphism will increase individual susceptibility to prostate cancer in white European men.
