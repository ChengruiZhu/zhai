Many neurons, especially those found in subcortical nuclei, often exhibit repetitive approximately periodic firing of action potentials. We have previously demonstrated how weak noise may inhibit repetitive activity in the Hodgkin-Huxley point model and in pairs of coupled type 1 model neurons. Here we investigated the effects of weak noise in the full Hodgkin-Huxley model which includes a spatial dimension. Our first simulations with noise throughout the whole length of the neuron revealed inhibition of repetitive activity with a minimum as the noise level increased, as in the point model. However, when we reduced the region of application of noise, very surprising results were obtained. Noise right alongside the region of excitation had no effect on the spiking activity. The amount of overlap in space of signal and noise was found to be the key variable in determining whether weak noise would inhibit the firing. If the signal and noise were on disjoint intervals, there was no diminution of activity, no matter how large the spatial extent of the noise. Thus, weak noise that occurred within the signal region could powerfully inhibit spike generation, but such noise immediately outside that region had little effect on the propagation of spikes.
