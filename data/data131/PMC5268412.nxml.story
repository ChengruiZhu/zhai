 of its veridical position with respect to an unpredictable event such as a punctuate flash. This illusion tells us something important about the visual system: contrary to classical computers, neural activity travels at a relatively slow speed. It is largely accepted that the resulting delays cause this perceived spatial lag of the flash. Still, after three decades of debates, there is no consensus regarding the underlying mechanisms. Herein, we re-examine the original hypothesis that this effect may be caused by the extrapolation of the stimulusâ€™ motion that is naturally generated in order to compensate for neural delays. Contrary to classical models, we propose a novel theoretical framework, called parodiction, that optimizes this process by explicitly using the precision of both sensory and predicted motion. Using numerical simulations, we show that the parodiction theory subsumes many of the previously proposed models and empirical studies. More generally, the parodiction hypothesis proposes that neural systems implement generic neural computations that can systematically compensate the existing neural delays in order to represent the predicted visual scene at the present time. It calls for new experimental approaches to directly explore the relationships between neural delays and predictive coding.
