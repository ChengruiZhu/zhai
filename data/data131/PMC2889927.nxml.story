Our immune system uses randomly modified T-cell receptors (TCRs) to adapt its discriminative capacity to rapidly changing pathogens. The T-cell receptor (TCR) has six flexible, variable peptide loops that make contact with antigens presented to them on the surface of other cells. Invariant Natural Killer T-cells (iNKT) are regulatory T-cells with a unique type of TCR (iNKT-TCR) that recognizes lipid antigens presented by specific MHC-like molecules known as CD1d. In human iNKT-TCRs, only one of the six loops, CDR3beta, is variable. By comparing how different human iNKT clones bind and react to different CD1d-lipid complexes we uncover the existence of a hierarchical order of the human iNKT cell repertoire in which strongly CD1d-binding clones are autoreactive while weak CD1d-binding clones are non-autoreactive. Direct measurements of iNKT-TCR binding to CD1d using surface plasmon resonance recapitulated this hierarchy at the protein level. The data show that variation in the CDR3beta loop conveys dramatic differences in human iNKT TCR affinity that are independent of the CD1d bound ligand. Thus the CDR3beta loop provides the structural basis for the functional hierarchy of the human iNKT repertoire. We postulate that during the life-course, CDR3beta-dependent asymmetrical activation of different human iNKT clones leads to a bias in the iNKT repertoire, and this could result in age-dependent defects of iNKT-mediated immune regulation in later life.
