The goal of our research was demonstrated that multiple molecules in microenvironments of the early osteoarthritis (OA) joint tissue may be actively responded to extracorporeal shockwave therapy (ESWT) treatment, which potentially regulated biological function of chondrocytes and synovial cells in early OA knee. We demonstrated that shockwave treatment induced the expression of protein-disulfide isomerase-associated 3 (Pdia-3) which was a significant mediator of the 1α,25-Dihydroxyvitamin D 3 (1α,25(OH)2D3) rapid signaling pathway, using two-dimensional electrophoresis, histological analysis and quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR). We observed that the expression of Pdia-3 at 2 weeks was significantly higher than that of other group at 4, 8, and 12 weeks post-shockwave treatment in early OA rat knee model. The other factors of the rapid membrane signaling pathway, including extracellular signal-regulated protein kinases 1 (ERK1), osteopontin (OPG), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), and matrix metallopeptidase 13 (MMP13) were examined and were found to be significantly increased at 2 weeks post-shockwave treatment by qPCR in early OA of the knee. Our proteomic data revealed significant Pdia-3 expression in microenvironments of OA joint tissue that could be actively responded to ESWT, which may potentially regulate the biological functions of chondrocytes and osteoblasts in the treatment of the early OA of the knee.
