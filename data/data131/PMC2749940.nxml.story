MnmE is an evolutionary conserved G protein that is involved in modification of the wobble U position of certain tRNAs to suppress translational wobbling. Despite high homology between its G domain and the small G protein Ras, MnmE displays entirely different regulatory properties to that of many molecular switch-type G proteins of the Ras superfamily, as its GTPase is activated by nucleotide-dependent homodimerization across the nucleotide-binding site. Here we explore the unusual G domain cycle of the MnmE protein by combining X-ray crystallography with pulse electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy, which enables distance determinations between spin markers introduced at specific sites within the G domain. We determined the structures of the full-length MnmE dimer in the diphosphate and triphosphate states, which represent distinct steps of the G domain cycle, and demonstrate that the G domain cycle of MnmE comprises large conformational changes and domain movements of up to 18 Ã…, in which the G domains of the dimeric protein traverse from a GDP-bound open state through an open/closed equilibrium in the triphosphate state to a closed conformation in the transition state, so as to assemble the catalytic machinery.
