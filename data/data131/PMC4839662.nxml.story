A cohesive reaction to emerging threats requires the efficient dissemination of knowledge and methodologies across multiple disciplinary boundaries. A “One Health” approach has been advocated to facilitate cross-disciplinary communication and research in responding to challenges in human, animal, and environmental health. We empirically describe collaboration networks surrounding one aspect of this One Health initiative: infectious disease transmission models. A systematic literature review and social network analysis showed that dynamic disease modelling grew faster than most biological and natural science disciplines over the last 25 y, yet the field remains somewhat compartmentalized. Many researchers contribute to a broad, cross-disciplinary group of journals, but publications from veterinarians and ecologists remain segregated into relatively discrete communities. While the veterinary and ecological communities regularly reference the broad, cross-disciplinary group, they only rarely cite each other; furthermore, the highest-tiered medical journals contributed very few papers to our search. Therefore, our results are somewhat mixed: while One Health may have precipitated a great deal of research interest in infectious disease, it has not fully overcome the barriers that segregate its contributing disciplines.
