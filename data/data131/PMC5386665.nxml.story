The esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) is usually develped from low-grade intraepithelial neoplasia (LGIEN) and high-grade intraepithelial neoplasia (HGIEN) to infiltrative squamous cell carcinoma. Till now, it remains hard to screen for infiltration at earlier stages, especially the differentiation between HGEIN and early infiltrative carcinoma. The purpose of this study is to determine a role of podoplanin in differentiating between HGEIN and early infiltrative squamous cell carcinoma. Totally 133 patients pathologically diagnosed with early ESCC and/or precancerous lesions were enrolled.The EnVision two-step IHC staining technique was applied using the monoclonal mouse anti-human Podoplanin antibody (clone number: D2-40). The expressions of PDPN protein on the basal layer of squamous epithelium lesions could be divided into three different patterns: complete type, incomplete (non-continuous) type, or missing type. A diagnosis of HGEIN can be made if the basal layer showed non-continuous or complete expression of PDPN and a diagnosis of early infiltration can be made if the expression of PDPN is completely missing. Our study confirmed that PDPN was a potential biomarker to identify the presence of early infiltrative squamous cell carcinoma.
