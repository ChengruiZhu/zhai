RNA binding proteins dictate RNA fate and function by modulating RNA processing, localization, translation, and stability. The consequences of RNA/protein interactions are determined, in part, by the position at which the protein binds the RNA. However, it is impossible to predict the target sites of most RNA binding proteins or to design them to bind chosen RNA sequences. In contrast, we show that the pentatricopeptide repeat (PPR) protein family holds exceptional promise for the rational design of specified RNAâ€“binding properties. PPR proteins harbor tandem arrays of a repeating structural unit that form a surface for binding single-stranded RNA. We show that PPR tracts bind specific RNA nucleotides via the combinatorial action of two amino acids in each repeat. This mechanism mimics the simplicity and predictability of the Watson-Crick pairing between nucleic acid strands, but at a protein/RNA interface. Our findings will facilitate the prediction of binding sites for the large number of PPR proteins found in nature. Additionally, our demonstration that a PPR tract can be engineered to bind specified RNA sequences implies that PPR proteins can be designed to bind desired RNA targets for applications in biotechnology, medicine, and basic research.
