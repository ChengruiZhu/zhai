Bacterial motility involves successive periods of relatively straight runs, interspersed by tumbles—periods in which the bacteria are reoriented randomly. To move in the direction of chemical gradients—a process known as chemotaxis—cells modulate the duration of the runs. To ascertain whether the direction of the current run is desirable, cells continuously monitor temporal changes in the chemoattractant concentration. However, the decisions can only be based on imperfect information about the environment because binding noise implies that receptor occupancy is a limited measure of the chemoattractant concentration. Bacteria cope by filtering the sensed signal to reduce the effect of this binding noise. Through simulations, Andrews, Yi, and Iglesias demonstrate that there is a particular filter cutoff frequency that achieves optimal chemotaxis. Moreover, using a model of the sensing mechanism, the authors also compute the theoretically optimal system for estimating the chemoattractant concentration from the noisy receptor-occupancy signal. Andrews and colleagues show that these two filtering systems are closely matched, and that their frequency-dependent behavior corresponds to published experimental data. Their results highlight the constraints that noise places on cellular performance as well as demonstrating how cells have evolved to deal with this uncertainty in an optimal fashion.
