The multiple auditory steady-state response (multiple-ASSR) technique, where thresholds for up to 8 frequencies (4 in each ear) are obtained simultaneously, is currently of great interest for audiometric assessment of infants. Although threshold estimates using the multiple-ASSR appear to be reasonably accurate, it is not currently known whether it is more efficient to use multiple stimuli or single stimuli when testing individuals with sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL). The current study investigated the effect of single versus multiple simultaneous stimuli on the 80- and 40-Hz ASSRs in adults with normal hearing or SNHL. Results showed significant interactions (i.e., decreased amplitudes) for both ASSRs going from single to multiple stimuli in one ear. Going from multiple one ear to multiple two ears did not further reduce the amplitude of the 80-Hz ASSR. At the 40-Hz rate, however, there was a further amplitude decrease going from one-ear multiple to two-ear multiple stimuli. Importantly, these interactions did not differ between the normal-hearing and SNHL groups. Although supportive of the multiple-ASSR technique, there are likely situations where it is more efficient to use single stimuli. Future studies are required to assess these interactions in infants with varying degrees and configurations of hearing loss.
