In various scientific domains, in particular in systems biology, dynamic mathematical models of increasing complexity are being developed and analyzed to study biochemical reaction networks. A major challenge in dealing with such models is the uncertainty in parameters such as kinetic constants; how to efficiently and precisely quantify the effects of parametric uncertainties on systems behavior remains a question. Addressing this computational challenge for large systems, with good scaling up to hundreds of species and kinetic parameters, is important for many forward (e.g., uncertainty quantification) and inverse (e.g., system identification) problems. Here, we propose a sparse, deterministic adaptive interpolation method tailored to high-dimensional parametric problems that allows for fast, deterministic computational analysis of large biochemical reaction networks. The method is based on adaptive Smolyak interpolation of the parametric solution at judiciously chosen points in high-dimensional parameter space, combined with adaptive time-stepping for the actual numerical simulation of the network dynamics. It is “non-intrusive” and well-suited both for massively parallel implementation and for use in standard (systems biology) toolboxes.
