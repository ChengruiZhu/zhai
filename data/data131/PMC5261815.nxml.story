The importance of iron in many physiological processes relies on its ability to participate in reduction-oxidation reactions. This property also leads to potential toxicity if concentrations of free iron are not properly managed by cells and tissues. Multicellular organisms therefore evolved intricate regulatory mechanisms to control systemic iron levels. A central regulatory mechanism is the binding of the hormone hepcidin to the iron exporter ferroportin, which controls the major fluxes of iron into blood plasma. Here, we present a mathematical model that is fitted and validated against experimental data to simulate the iron content in different organs following dietary changes and/or inflammatory states, or genetic perturbation of the hepcidin/ferroportin regulatory system. We find that hepcidin mediated ferroportin control is essential, but not sufficient to quantitatively explain several of our experimental findings. Thus, further regulatory mechanisms had to be included in the model to reproduce reduced serum iron levels in response to inflammation, the preferential accumulation of iron in the liver in the case of iron overload, or the maintenance of physiological serum iron concentrations if dietary iron levels are very high. We conclude that hepcidin-independent mechanisms play an important role in maintaining systemic iron homeostasis.
