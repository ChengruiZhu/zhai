, exhibit reversible decreases in viscosity in response to the addition of ATP under appropriate conditions. The protoplasm material prepared by extraction with KCl solution can apparently exist in either a high or a low viscosity state. As prepared, it is in the low viscosity condition. Rapid and extensive increases in viscosity of the extract are brought about by addition of AMP, inorganic phosphate, or, under certain conditions, of ATP. Only after the high viscosity state has been attained does addition of appropriate quantities of ATP cause a reversible decrease in viscosity. 2. The active principle of crude plasmodial extracts may be concentrated by fractional precipitation with ammonium sulfate and is found in the fraction precipitated between 30 and 40 per cent saturation. This material possesses a higher viscosity than does the original crude extract and is apparently in the high viscosity state since the addition of ATP causes an immediate reversible decrease in viscosity. 3. The ATP-sensitive fraction of myxomycete plasmodia possesses a viscosity which is dependent upon its previous thermal treatment. Extracts incubated at 0° for a period of a few hours increase greatly in viscosity when they are returned to 24.5°. This increased viscosity is structural in nature, is destroyed by mechanical agitation of the solution, and may be reversibly destroyed by addition of ATP. 4. It is suggested that the ATP-responsive protein of myxomycete plasmodia may be related to sol-gel transformations which have been observed in intact plasmodia and may participate in the protoplasmic streaming of the intact organism. This suggestion is based upon the following facts: (
