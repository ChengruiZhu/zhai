Proline-rich tyrosine kinase 2 (PYK2), a tyrosine kinase structurally related to focal adhesion kinase (FAK), is implicated in regulating cytoskeletal organization. However, mechanisms by which PYK2 participates in and regulates cytoskeletal organization remain largely unknown. Here we report identification of PSGAP, a novel protein that interacts with PYK2 and FAK and contains multiple domains including a pleckstrin homology domain, a rhoGTPase-activating protein domain, and a Src homology 3 domain. PYK2 interacts with PSGAP Src homology 3 domain via the carboxyl-terminal proline-rich sequence. PSGAP is able to increase GTPase activity of CDC42 and RhoA in vitro and in vivo. Remarkably, PYK2, but not FAK, can activate CDC42 via inhibition of PSGAP-mediated GTP hydrolysis of CDC42. Moreover, PSGAP is localized at cell periphery in fibroblasts in a pleckstrin homology domainâ€“dependent manner. Over expression of PSGAP in fibroblasts results in reorganization of cytoskeletal structures and changes of cellular morphology, which requires rhoGTPase-activating activity. Taken together, our results suggest that PSGAP is a signaling protein essential for PYK2 regulation of cytoskeletal organization via Rho family GTPases.
