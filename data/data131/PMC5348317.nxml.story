Lamin A/C proteins are major components of nuclear laminae and were encoded by the LMNA gene. Recent studies have found that in addition to provides nuclear-membrane strength; it also regulates the gene expression. Lamin A/C has been confirmed as an autoantigen in RA, SLE and vasculitis. Anti-Lamin A/C antibodies also have been found by indirect immunofluorescence method. In this study, we used various research methods to confirm Lamin A/C is an autoantigen in Han Chinese patients with confirmed Sj√∂gren's syndrome (SS). To further investigate the relationship between the autoimmune disease antigens, we compared the amino acid sequence of Lamin A/C epitope and several common antigens' antigenic determinant. As a result, we found that Lamin A/C has similar epitopes with U1RNP. It means that the potential relationship exist between Lamin A/C and U1RNP. Clinical data we collected also showed that anti-Lamin A/C and anti-U1RNP antibodies always appear in same serum sample. Therefore, we speculated that cross-reaction may take place between antigen and potential antigen, which have similar epitope. Then, by epitope spreading, the potential antigen can be a new autoantigen. Our study provided a new thinking for further research about the relationship between autoantigens and their development mechanism in autoimmune diseases.
