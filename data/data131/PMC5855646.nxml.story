Coronary artery disease (CAD) is one of the most common causes of death worldwide. In the last decade, significant advancements in CAD treatment have been made. The existing treatment is medical, surgical or a combination of both depending on the extent, severity and clinical presentation of CAD. The collaboration between different science disciplines such as biotechnology and tissue engineering has led to the development of novel therapeutic strategies such as stem cells, nanotechnology, robotic surgery and other advancements (3-D printing and drugs). These treatment modalities show promising effects in managing CAD and associated conditions. Research on stem cells focuses on studying the potential for cardiac regeneration, while nanotechnology research investigates nano-drug delivery and percutaneous coronary interventions including stent modifications and coatings. This article aims to provide an update on the literature (in vitro, translational, animal and clinical) related to these novel strategies and to elucidate the rationale behind their potential treatment of CAD. Through the extensive and continued efforts of researchers and clinicians worldwide, these novel strategies hold the promise to be effective alternatives to existing treatment modalities.
