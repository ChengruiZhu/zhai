Increasing evidence suggests that undernutrition during the fetal period may lead to glucose intolerance, impair the insulin response and induce insulin resistance (IR). Considering the importance of chromium (Cr) in maintaining carbohydrate metabolism, the present study aimed to determine the effects of maternal low Cr (LC) on glucose metabolism in C57BL mice offspring, and the involved mechanisms. Weaned C57BL mice were born from mothers fed a control diet or LC diet, and were then fed a control or LC diet for 13 weeks. Subsequently, the liver microRNA (miRNA/miR) expression profile was analyzed by miRNA array analysis. A maternal LC diet increased fasting serum glucose (P<0.05) and insulin levels (P<0.05), homeostasis model assessment of IR index (P<0.01), and the area under curve for glucose concentration during oral glucose tolerance test (P<0.01). In addition, 8 upregulated and 6 downregulated miRNAs were identified in the maternal LC group (fold change â‰¥2, P<0.05). miRNA-gene networks, Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathway analysis of differentially expressed miRNAs, and miRNA overexpression in HepG2 cells revealed the critical role of insulin signaling, via miR-327, miR-466f-3p and miR-223-3p, in the effects of early life Cr restriction on glucose metabolism. In conclusion, maternal Cr restriction may irreversibly increase IR, which may involve a specific miRNA affecting the insulin signaling pathway.
