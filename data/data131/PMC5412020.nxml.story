In healthy peripartum women, serum Relaxin-2 levels (measured by ELISA in the second half of pregnancy) were elevated showing a decreasing trend in the first postpartum week and returned to non-pregnant levels thereafter. In PPCM patients diagnosed in the first postpartum week, serum Relaxin-2 levels were lower compared to healthy postpartum stage-matched controls. In PPCM patients diagnosed later (0.5–10 months postpartum) Relaxin-2 levels were in the range of non-pregnant controls and not different from healthy postpartum stage-matched controls. In mice, serum Relaxin-1 (functional equivalent of human Relaxin-2) was increased late in pregnancy and rapidly cleared in the first postpartum week. In mice with PPCM due to a cardiomyocyte-specific knockout of STAT3 (CKO) neither low nor high dose of recombinant Relaxin-2 (serelaxin, sRlx-LD: 30 µg/kg/day; sRlx-HD: 300 µg/kg/day) affected cardiac fibrosis, inflammation and heart failure but sRlx-HD increased capillary/cardiomyocyte ratio. sRlx-HD significantly increased heart/body weight ratio and cardiomyocyte cross-sectional area in postpartum CKO and wild-type mice without changing the foetal gene expression program (ANP or β-MHC). sRlx-HD augmented plasma Prolactin levels in both genotypes, which induced cardiac activation of STAT5.
