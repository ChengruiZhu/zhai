Interleukin (IL)-12 is the key cytokine in the initiation of a Th1 response and has shown promise as an anti-cancer agent; however, clinical trials involving IL-12 have been unsuccessful due to toxic side-effects. To address this issue, lentiviral vectors were used to transduce tumour cell lines that were injected as an autologous tumour cell vaccine. The focus of the current study was to test the efficacy of this approach in a solid tumour model. SCCVII cells that were transduced to produce IL-12 at different concentrations were then isolated. Subcutaneous injection of parental SCCVII cells results in tumour development, while a mixture of IL-12-producing and non-producing cells results in tumour clearance. Interestingly, when comparing mice injected a mixture of SCCVII and either high IL-12-producing tumour cells or low IL-12-producing tumour cells, we observed that mixtures containing small amounts of high producing cells lead to tumour clearance, whereas mixtures containing large amounts of low producing cells fail to elicit protection, despite the production of equal amounts of total IL-12 in both mixtures. Furthermore, immunizing mice with IL-12-producing cells leads to the establishment of both local and systemic immunity against challenge with SCCVII. Using depletion antibodies, it was shown that both CD4
