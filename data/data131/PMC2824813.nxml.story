Viruses have represented a constant threat to human communities throughout their history, therefore, human genes involved in anti-viral response can be thought of as targets of virus-driven selective pressure. Here we utilized the marks left by selection to identify viral infection-associated allelic variants. We analyzed more than 660,000 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) genotyped in 52 human populations, and we used virus diversity (the number of different viruses in a geographic region) to measure virus-driven selective pressure. Results showed that genes involved in immune response and in the biosynthesis of glycan structures functioning as viral receptors display more variants associated with virus diversity than expected by chance. The same holds true for genes encoding proteins that directly interact with viral components. Genome-wide analysis identified 441 variants, mapping to 139 human genes, significantly associated with virus-diversity. We analyzed the functional relationships among genes subjected to virus-driven selective pressure and identified a complex interaction network enriched in viral products-interacting proteins. Therefore, we describe a novel approach for the identification of gene variants that may be involved in the susceptibility to viral infections.
