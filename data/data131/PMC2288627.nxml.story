Global patterns and mechanistic determinants of bacterial spread in mammalian organisms are difficult to obtain through numerical and topographical mapping of a single bacterial population. Appreciation of the true pathogenetic events during infections needs to be based on the understanding of the fine interactions that control the infection dynamics of individual subpopulations in the same host. We have used molecular techniques to tag individually otherwise identical subpopulations of bacteria. We have used these bacteria, called wild-type isogenic tagged strains (WITS), in simultaneous infections in the same animal to gather insights into the patterns of spread of individual subpopulations of bacteria in the tissues and interactions between bacteria and phagocytes. Combining numerical fluctuation in the WITS populations with mathematical modelling and statistical analysis, we have gathered data on the relative occurrence of bacterial growth and death in different phases of the disease process. Our analyses support a model in which shortly after infection, concomitant death and rapid bacterial replication lead to the establishment of independent bacterial subpopulations in different organs. Later, decreased microbial mortality leads to an exponential increase in the number of bacteria that spread locally, with subsequent mixing of bacteria between organs. The work illustrates the importance of unravelling heterogeneous traits of infections to reconstruct and understand the true nature of the global disease process.
