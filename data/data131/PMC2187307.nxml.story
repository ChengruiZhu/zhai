The genes that code for the human lymphocyte cell surface determinants defined by monoclonal antibodies A- 1A5 and A- 3A4 have been genetically mapped. All human chromosomes, except Y, were included in a series of human less than mouse lymphocyte hybrid populations that retained expression of lymphocyte-specific surface markers. Expression of the A- 1A5 and A- 3A4 antigens was quantitated by indirect immunofluorescence and fluorescence-activated cell sorter (FACS) analysis. Hybrid populations heterogeneous for antigen expression were sorted to yield antigenically homogeneous subpopulations. Isozyme analysis indicated concordant segregation of the A- 1A5 determinant with chromosome 10, and the A- 3A4 determinant with chromosome 4. In contrast to the unhybridized human parent cell line (MOLT-4), from which A- 1A5 immunoprecipitated two proteins (160,000 and 125,000 Mr), A- 1A5 only immunoprecipitated a single band (125,000 Mr) from an A- 1A5 -expressing human less than mouse hybrid. The genetic disassociation of these two proteins from the A- 1A5 -reactive complex suggests that the appearance of the 160,000 Mr protein requires a gene locus that is unlinked to the locus for the 125,000 Mr protein on chromosome 10. A third component of the A- 1A5 -reactive protein complex (210,000 Mr), which is recognized by the monoclonal antibody TS2/7, was not expressed on the parent MOLT-4 cells, but was weakly expressed on MOLT-4 less than mouse BW5147 hybrids. This allowed preliminary mapping of that determinant to either chromosome 10 or 15. The A- 3A4 antigen (approximately 45,000 Mr) is a novel cell surface structure expressed on all hematopoietic cell lines tested, and represents the first cell surface marker mapped to chromosome 4.
