In addition to the 85-95 kD CD44 species found on most hemopoietic cell types, the human myelomonocytic cell line KG1a expresses proteins of approximately 115 kD and 130 kD that react with monoclonal antibodies belonging to CD44. The possibility that these higher molecular weight species may represent novel CD44 isoforms containing additional protein sequence was investigated. CD44 cDNA clones were isolated from a plasmid-based expression library prepared from KG1a mRNA. One of the three clones obtained (clone 2.3) was found to encode a CD44 molecule of approximately 130 kD in transfected COS cells. Sequences analysis indicated that the molecule encoded by this cDNA clone, designated CD44R1, was essentially identical to CD44 except for the presence of an additional 132 amino acids inserted into the extracellular domain. This inserted region is rich in serine and threonine residues that may serve as sites of O-linked glycosylation, and contains a potential site of N- linked glycosylation and a potential site of chondroitin sulphate attachment. PCR analysis using primers that flank the inserted region present within CD44R1 identified an additional CD44 isoform, designated CD44R2, that contains only the last 69 amino acids present within the unique region of CD44R1. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells and granulocytes from normal individuals and patients with chronic myelogenous leukemia, polycythemia vera, or acute myelomonocytic leukemia, express both CD44R1 and CD44R2. In contrast, CD44R1 and CD44R2 appear to be differentially expressed in various CD44-positive cell lines. Thus KG1a, and the Epstein-Barr Virus-transformed B cell lines WalkDR4 and Way-1 express both CD44 and the CD44 isoforms CD44R1 and CD44R2, while the myeloid cell lines HL60 and U937 express high levels of CD44, but only very low levels of CD44R1 and CD44R2. The CD44- negative cell lines DHL-4, DHL-10, Jurkat, and K562 are also negative for CD44R1 and CD44R2.
