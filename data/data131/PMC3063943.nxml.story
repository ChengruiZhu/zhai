This review is focused on a novel cellular probe, the plasmonic nanobubble (PNB), which has the dynamically tunable and multiple functions of imaging, diagnosis, delivery, therapy and, ultimately, theranostics. The concept of theranostics was recently introduced in order to unite the clinically important stages of treatment, namely diagnosis, therapy and therapy guidance, into one single, rapid and highly accurate procedure. Cell level theranostics will have far-reaching implications for the treatment of cancer and other diseases at their earliest stages. PNBs were developed to support cell level theranostics as a new generation of on-demand tunable cellular probes. A PNB is a transient vapor nanobubble that is generated within nanoseconds around an overheated plasmonic nanoparticle with a short laser pulse. In the short term, we expect that PNB technology will be rapidly adaptable to clinical medicine, where the single cell resolution it provides will be critical for diagnosing incipient or residual disease and eliminating cancer cells, while leaving healthy cells intact. This review discusses mechanisms of plasmonic nanobubbles and their biomedical applications with the focus on cancer cell theranostics.
