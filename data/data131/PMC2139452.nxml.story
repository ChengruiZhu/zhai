) a protein secreted by the activated macrophage. In vivo the T cell may have a role in B-cell triggering, either in activating the macrophage or in aiding in presentation of antigen on the macrophage surface. Thymus-independent antigens are proposed to induce an IgM response because they are able to provide "signal two" either by direct interaction with the B cell or via irritation or activation of the macrophage. The stimulatory effect of T cells activated by an allogeneic interaction was used as a model of one influence of the T cell on the development of an antibody response. The presence in cultures of nu/nu spleen of an allogeneic interaction had no effect on the inability of these cells to respond to FγG. However when a source of the postulated second signal such as the supernatant of a macrophage culture was present, an allogeneic interaction had a powerful amplifying effect on the anti-FγG response. In contrast the response of nu/nu spleen cultures to heterologous erythrocytes was greatly enhanced by the presence of an allogeneic interaction. It is suggested that since there was a definite basal response to the heterologous erythrocytes added alone, the enhancement represented not an activation of more B cells but rather an amplification of this basal response. Thus the anti-FγG response in cultures of nu/nu spleen differentiates between factors such as those released by activated macrophages that are involved in B-cell triggering and factors released by activated T cells that amplify the numbers of antibody-forming cells resulting from a B cell already triggered.
