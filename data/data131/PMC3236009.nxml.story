Mouse (m) 11β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 2 (11βHSD2) was homology-modeled, and its structure and ligand-receptor interaction were analyzed. The modeled m11βHSD2 showed significant 3D similarities to the human (h) 11βHSD1 and 2 structures. The contact energy profiles of the m11βHSD2 model were in good agreement with those of the h11βHSD1 and 2 structures. The secondary structure of the m11βHSD2 model exhibited a central 6-stranded all-parallel β-sheet sandwich-like structure, flanked on both sides by 3-helices. Ramachandran plots revealed that only 1.1% of the amino acid residues were in the disfavored region for m11βHSD2. Further, the molecular surfaces and electrostatic analyses of the m11βHSD2 model at the ligand-binding site exhibited that the model was almost identical to the h11βHSD2 model. Furthermore, docking simulation and ligand-receptor interaction analyses revealed the similarity of the ligand-receptor bound conformation between the m11βHSD2 and h11βHSD2 models. These results indicate that the m11βHSD2 model was successfully evaluated and analyzed. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of a m11βHSD2 model with detailed analyses, and our data verify that the mouse model can be utilized for application to the human model to target 11βHSD2 for the development of anticancer drugs.
