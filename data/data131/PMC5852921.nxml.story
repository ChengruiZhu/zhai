INDUSEM was established as an INDO-US Satellite Knowledge Network in 2005. It brought together the academic leaders and innovators from India and the US with the goal of creating collaborative synergies and creative solutions to advance the knowledge and science of emergency medicine (EM) in India. Since 2005, the leadership of INDUSEM devoted substantial resources, effort, and expertise to ensure that newly implemented clinical institutes and training programs have the necessary resources and logistical support to effectively advance EM and Traumatology Sciences in India. As a result, significant synergies and progress were achieved toward establishing EM training programs and building clinical infrastructure through education, grant funding, research, skills development, bidirectional collaborations, and sustained influence on public health policy development. As INDUSEM's mission matures, its efforts will increasingly focus on creating long-term sustainability across clinical, didactic, educational, outreach, health policy, and research domains. In this joint statement, the authors describe the evolution of INDUSEM's institution of INDO-US Summit into the World Academic Congress of EM , with the parallel inception of an India-centric academic enterprise, EMINDIA.
