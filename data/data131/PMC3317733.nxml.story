Bioluminescent proteins are important for various cellular processes, such as gene expression analysis, drug discovery, bioluminescent imaging, toxicity determination, and DNA sequencing studies. Hence, the correct identification of bioluminescent proteins is of great importance both for helping genome annotation and providing a supplementary role to experimental research to obtain insight into bioluminescent proteinsâ€™ functions. However, few computational methods are available for identifying bioluminescent proteins. Therefore, in this paper we develop a new method to predict bioluminescent proteins using a model based on position specific scoring matrix and auto covariance. Tested by 10-fold cross-validation and independent test, the accuracy of the proposed model reaches 85.17% for the training dataset and 90.71% for the testing dataset respectively. These results indicate that our predictor is a useful tool to predict bioluminescent proteins. This is the first study in which evolutionary information and local sequence environment information have been successfully integrated for predicting bioluminescent proteins. A web server (BLPre) that implements the proposed predictor is freely available.
