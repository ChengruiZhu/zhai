The clinical value of 3D printed surgical guides in resection and reconstruction of malignant bone tumor around the knee joint were studied. For this purpose, a sample of 66 patients from October 2013 to October 2015 were randomly selected and further divided into control group and observation group, each group consisted of 33 cases. The control group was treated by conventional tumor resection whereas, in the observation group, the tumor was resected with 3D printed surgical guide. However, reconstruction of tumor-type hinge prosthesis was performed in both groups and then the clinical effect was compared. Results show that there was no significant difference in the operation time between the two groups (p>0.05). However, the blood loss, resection length and complication rate were found significantly lower in the observation group than in the control group (p<0.05). The rate of negative margin and the recurrence rate in the 12-month follow-up (p>0.05) between two groups were statistically the same (p>0.05), whereas the Musculoskeletal Tumor Society (MSTS) score of the knee joint in the observation group was significantly better than that of the control group (p<0.05) after 1, 3, 6 and 12 months of the operation. Consequently, the 3D printed surgical guides can significantly improve the postoperative joint function after resection and reconstruction of malignant bone tumor around the knee joint and can reduce the incidence of complications.
