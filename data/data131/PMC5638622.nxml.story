Sensory processing is known to span multiple regions of the nervous system. However, electrophysiological recordings during sensory processing have traditionally been limited to a single region or brain layer. With recent advances in experimental techniques, recorded spiking activity from multiple regions simultaneously is feasible. However, other important quantities— such as inter-region connection strengths—cannot yet be measured. Here, we develop new theoretical tools to leverage data obtained by recording from two different brain regions simultaneously. We address the following questions: what are the crucial neural network attributes that enable sensory processing across different regions, and how are these attributes related to one another? With a novel theoretical framework to efficiently calculate spiking statistics, we can characterize a high dimensional parameter space that satisfies data constraints. We apply our results to the olfactory system to make specific predictions about effective network connectivity. Our framework relies on incorporating relatively easy-to-measure quantities to predict hard-to-measure interactions across multiple brain regions. Because this work is adaptable to other systems, we anticipate it will be a valuable tool for analysis of other larger scale brain recordings.
