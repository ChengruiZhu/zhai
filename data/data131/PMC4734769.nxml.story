Eukaryotic genomes range from millions to billions of base pairs in size, but for many genetic experiments it is sufficient to gather information from just a fraction of these sites. In practice, selecting a consistent set of sites can be achieved by cutting genomic DNA with enzymes that recognize DNA sequence motifs, and then sequencing the ends of the resulting fragments. The advantages of this well-known approach are its low cost relative to whole-genome sequencing (WGS) and that it does not require a sequenced genome. These methods, for example genotyping-by-sequencing (GBS), are popular for mapping genes and studying population genetics, particularly in non-model organisms. Here we demonstrate, however, that computational tools designed for WGS are insufficient for handling certain error types that arise in GBS and other similar methods. We present a modified protocol for GBS and a statistical method for detecting these errors, implemented in the software package GBStools. We tested our methods on human DNA samples from Argentine populations. Our results reveal widely varying degrees of European and Native American ancestry, and that rare genetic variants are more numerous than would be expected in a population with constant size.
