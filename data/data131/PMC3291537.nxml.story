Elastomeric proteins such as elastin, resilin, abductin and wheat gluten represent a remarkable class of self-assembling proteins that provide properties of extensibility and elastic recoil. Although unrelated from an evolutionary viewpoint, these proteins nonetheless share a common sequence design involving highly repetitive elastomeric regions interspersed with elements capable of forming cross-links that help stabilize the formation of polymers. Attempts to explore the influence of domain architecture on the self-assembly and mechanical properties of elastomeric proteins at the molecular level have largely been hindered by a general lack of detailed structural information. Here we introduce a novel theoretical study based on random walks to simulate the self-assembly of elastomeric proteins. Applying this model, we explored the impact of different configurations of elastomeric and cross-linking elements on the stability of the resultant polymer. Through exploring the complex relationships between elastomeric domains, required to drive self-assembly, and cross-linking domains, required for structural integrity, results from these simulations provide insights into the molecular basis for the evolution of elastomeric proteins as well as help guide the rational design of novel elastomeric-peptides.
