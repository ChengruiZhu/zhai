Fresh human tali and distal femoral condyles were obtained from 7 human donors (mean age; 39 years-old, 4 male and 3 female) with no history of joint disease. Gross morphology was assessed using Collins grading 0-4 and only normal joints of grade 0-1 were used. Two damage models were introduced: 1) treatment with IL-1β (10ng/ml) at 48 hours before co-culture; or 2) controlled mechanical impaction (600 N within 2 ms). Cartilage explants (8mm) and grossly normal synovium (8 mm) from both joints were harvested and randomized to one of six treatment groups (n = 5 in each group): non-treated cartilage without or with synovium (Group 1 or 2), IL-1β-treated cartilage without or with synovium (Group 3 or 4), impacted cartilage without or with synovium (Group 5 or 6). Samples were collected at 0, 2, and 14 days and assessed for the percentage of live cells and histology with Safranin O staining. Cell survival was measured using calcein AM and ethidium bromide homodimer-1. Image analysis was performed on the superficial and middle/deep zone. Live cells were counted using Image J. Histological grading was based on modified Mankin score. The level of significance for all analysis was set at
