Colorectal cancer (CRC) is a most common digestive system malignant tumor. p53 mutation has essential role in cancers and is frequently observed in CRC and presents a huge challenge. p53 mutation has been reported to attenuate the inhibitory effect of photofrin-based photodynamic therapy (PDT). p53 mutation-induced gain of function brings up the dysfunction of carcinogenic factors, including miRNAs. Our research found that PDT suppressed CRC cell viability, reduced the tumor size and prolonged the survival time, all of which could be attenuated by p53 mutation or deletion. After p53 mutation or deletion, several miRNA expression levels were downregulated, among which miR-124 was the most strongly downregulated, whereas iASPP expression was upregulated. p53 binds to the promoter of miR-124 to promote its expression and then inhibited iASPP expression, so as to amplify the inhibitory effect of PDT on wild-type p53 cells. In p53-mutant or -deleted cells, this binding no longer worked to promote miR-124 expression, and iASPP expression increased, finally resulted in promoted CRC cell viability upon PDT. The interactive modulation among miR and iASPP in p53-mutant or -deleted cells may serve as a crucial pathway, which mediates therapy resistance when p53 is mutated or deleted, in the process of PDT treatment of CRC.
