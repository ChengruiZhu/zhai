In the ontogeny of a normal immune response, a series of checkpoints must be overcome to ensure that unwanted and/or harmful self-directed activation responses are avoided. Many of the molecules now known to be active in this overseeing of the evolving immune activation cascade, contributing inhibitory signals to dampen an overexuberant response, belong to the immunoglobulin supergene family. These include members of the CD28/CTLA-4:B7.1/B7.2 receptor/ligand family, PD-1 and PDL-1, CD200 and CD200R, and the more recently described V-domain immunoglobulin suppressor of T-cell activation and its ligand (VSIG-3/IGSF11). Unfortunately, from the point of view of improving immunotargeting of cancer cells, triggering these checkpoint inhibitory signaling pathways, so necessary to maintain self-tolerance, simultaneously acts to prevent effective tumor immunity. The recent development of reagents, predominantly antibodies, to act as checkpoint blockade agents, has had a dramatic effect on human cancer treatment, with a marked reported success for anti-CTLA-4 and PD-1 in particular in clinical trials. This review provides a general overview of the data now available showing the promise of such treatments to our cancer armamentarium and elaborates in depth on the potential promise of what can be regarded as an underappreciated target molecule for checkpoint blockade in chronic lymphocytic leukemia and solid tumors, CD200.
