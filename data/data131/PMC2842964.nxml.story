The fractional flow reserve (FFR) is a simple, reliable, and reproducible physiologic index of lesion severity. In patients with intermediate stenosis, FFR≥0.75 can be used to safely defer percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), and patients with FFR≥0.75 have a very low cardiac event rate. Coronary pressure measurement can determine which lesion should be treated with PCI in patients with tandem lesions, and PCI on the basis of FFR has been demonstrated to result in an acceptably low repeat PCI rate. FFR can identify patients with equivocal left main coronary artery disease who benefit from coronary bypass surgery. Coronary pressure measurement distinguishes patients with an abrupt pressure drop pattern from those with a gradual pressure drop pattern, and the former group of patients benefit from PCI. Coronary pressure measurement is clinically useful in evaluating sufficient recruitable coronary collateral blood flow for prevention of ischemia, which affects future cardiac events. FFR is useful for the prediction of restenosis after PCI. As an end-point of PCI, FFR ≥0.95 and ≥0.90 would be appropriate for coronary stenting and coronary angioplasty, respectively. In summary, if you encounter a coronary stenosis in doubt you should measure pressure rather than dilate it.
