Myeloid derived suppressor cells (MDSC) are very important in tumor immune evasion and they dramatically increased in peripheral blood of patients with osteosarcoma cancer. The association between MDSC and various cytokines has been studied in the peripheral blood. However, little is known about the mechanism drawing MDSC into tumor parenchyma. This study was to analyze the correlation between MDSC subsets and interleukin 18 (IL-18) level in osteosarcoma tumor model and its effect on the immunotherapy. MDSC were isolated from the blood and parenchyma and analyzed in the osteosarcoma tumor model. IL-18 levels were detected by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) assay, real-time PCR, western blot and flow cytometry. Moreover, combination treatment with IL-18 inhibition and anti-PD1 was conducted to assess the therapeutic effects of IL-18 blockade. Results showed MDSC levels had a positive correlation with IL-18, suggesting IL-18 may attract MDSC into the parenchyma. IL-18 gene and protein expression significantly increased in blood and tumor lysates of tumor-bearing mice. Anti-IL-18 treatment significantly decreased G-MDSC and M-MDSC in the peripheral blood and tumor. Furthermore, combination therapy decreased the tumor burden and increased CD4
