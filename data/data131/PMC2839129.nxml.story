To investigate gender differences, if any, in leptin concentrations from umbilical cord blood of new born infants of mothers with type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM), gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM), and Non diabetic (ND) at delivery. Serum leptin concentrations were measured in 105 newborns (53 males and 52 females in the three groups). Blood was taken from the umbilical cord of the babies at delivery. Maternal anthropometric measurements were recorded within 48 hours after delivery. Pearson correlation coefficient was used to explore the relationship between serum leptin concentrations and anthropometric measures of the fetus and their mother. Both Serum leptin level and serum C-peptide was measured by chemiluminescence based ELISA. The median range of leptin concentration in cord blood was ND group: Male [13.91 (3.22 – 47.63)], Female [16.88 (2 – 43.65)]; GDM group: Male [32 (7 – 76.00)], Female [36.73 (4.80 – 81.20)]; DM group: Male [20.90 (2 –76.00)], Female [32 {2.58 – 80.67)]. Cord serum leptin levels correlated with birth weight(r=0.587, p=0.0001), ponderal index (PI) (r=.319, p=0.024)of the babies and body mass index (BMI) (r=−0.299, p=0.035) of their mothers but did not correlate with gestational age, cord serum C-peptide concentration or placental weight at delivery. Leptin concentrations were higher in the female fetus in comparison to the male fetus. Birth weight of the female fetuses were also higher than that of male fetus. We found that there are very strong associations between cord leptin concentrations at delivery and birth weight, ponderal index of the baby, body mass index of the mothers with Type 2 DM. We also found that high leptin levels could represent an important feedback modulator of substrate supply and subsequently for adipose tissue status during late gestation or adipose tissue is the major determinant of circulating leptin levels.
