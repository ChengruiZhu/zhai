 cause three different syndromes—XP (xeroderma pigmentosum), TTD (trichothiodystrophy), and CS (Cockayne syndrome)—and various different phenotypes, such as sun-induced hyperpigmentation of the skin, cutaneous abnormalities, neuronal degeneration, and developmental retardation. In addition, while some mutations cause a highly elevated cancer risk, others do not. The multitask protein Xpd functions in transcription, nucleotide excision repair (NER), and in cell cycle regulation. In a situation where transcription is not required and NER not induced, we specifically analyzed the cell cycle function of Xpd in Drosophila. In this situation Xpd locally controls the dynamic localization of Cdk7, the catalytic subunit of the Cdk activating kinase (CAK) to and away from its cellular targets, thereby regulating mitotic kinase activity and mitotic exit. Xpd also controls spindle dynamics to prevent formation of multipolar and promiscuous spindles and aneuploidy. Through multitask proteins like Xpd and Cdk7 cells regulate different cellular pathways in a coordinated fashion. In addition to the basic research relevance, the newly gained knowledge about the cell cycle function of Xpd and its control of spindle dynamics is also relevant for human
