MicroRNAs are key players in most biological processes. Some microRNAs are involved in the genesis of tumors and are therefore termed oncomiRs, while others, termed metastamiRs, play a significant role in the formation of cancer metastases. Previously, we identified ten different cellular microRNAs that downregulate the expression of MICB, a ligand of the activating NK receptor NKG2D. Interestingly, several of the ten MICB-targeting microRNAs, such as miR-10b, are involved in tumor formation and metastasis. In this work, we identify a complex interplay between these different microRNAs. Specifically, we demonstrate that three of the MICB-targeting microRNAs: miR-20a, miR-17-5p and miR-93, also target the same site in the 3′UTR of TWIST1, a transcription factor implicated in cancer metastasis. Additionally, we show that miR-520d-5p targets a different site in the 3′UTR of TWIST1. We next show that the miR-520d-5p-mediated decrease of TWIST1 expression results in reduced expression of one of its targets, miR-10b, and in the restoration of E-Cadherin expression, which in turn results in reduced cellular motility and invasiveness. Finally, we show that miR-520d-5p leads to reduced proliferation of tumor cells, and that high levels of miR-520d-5p correlate with higher survival rates of cancer patients.
