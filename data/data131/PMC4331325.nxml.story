Ebola virus (EBOV) is a deadly virus that has caused several fatal outbreaks. Recently it caused another outbreak and resulted in thousands afflicted cases. Effective and approved vaccine or therapeutic treatment against this virus is still absent. In this study, we aimed to predict B-cell epitopes from several EBOV encoded proteins which may aid in developing new antibody-based therapeutics or viral antigen detection method against this virus. Multiple sequence alignment (MSA) was performed for the identification of conserved region among glycoprotein (GP), nucleoprotein (NP), and viral structural proteins (VP40, VP35, and VP24) of EBOV. Next, different consensus immunogenic and conserved sites were predicted from the conserved region(s) using various computational tools which are available in Immune Epitope Database (IEDB). Among GP, NP, VP40, VP35, and VP30 protein, only NP gave a 100% conserved GEQYQQLR B-cell epitope that fulfills the ideal features of an effective B-cell epitope and could lead a way in the milieu of Ebola treatment. However, successful in vivo and in vitro studies are prerequisite to determine the actual potency of our predicted epitope and establishing it as a preventing medication against all the fatal strains of EBOV.
