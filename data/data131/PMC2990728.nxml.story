Metabolic syndrome (MS) may comprise several clinical conditions such as obesity, diabetes and inflammatory disorders, which are characterized by metabolic imbalances. The study of glucose transport and regulation by insulin in lymphocytes is important, since the way they increase inflammation and susceptibility to infections are common in MS. We studied glucose internalization in isolated thymocytes and splenocytes, its regulation by insulin, and the role of three glucose transporters (Gluts) in control and in MS rats. Control glucose internalization and insulin responses were lower in splenocytes than in thymocytes. Control and insulin-induced glucose internalization in thymocytes declined with age, while transport by splenocyte continued to respond to insulin. Control thymocyte glucose internalization was blocked by antibodies against Glut 1 and 4, while the insulin response also was blocked by an anti-Glut 3 antibody. On four month old control and insulin-induced response, splenocyte transport was only blocked by Glut 1 and 4 antibodies. At six months splenocyte glucose internalization depended on Glut 1 and was less sensitive to the effects of an anti-Glut 4 antibody. In MS splenocytes the capacity of anti-Glut 1 antibodies to inhibit control and insulin-dependent glucose transport was less significant, and we found that in MS rats, glucose internalization was dependent on Glut 3 and Glut 4. In summary, the altered metabolic state present in MS rats shows signs of modulation of glucose internalization by the Glut1, Glut 3 and Glut 4 transporters, compared with its own age control.
