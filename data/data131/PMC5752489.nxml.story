The BCR/ABL fusion gene and its downstream signaling pathways such as Ras/Raf/MAPK, JAK/STAT3, and PI3K/AKT pathways play important roles in malignant transformation of leukemia, especially chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML). Our previous study showed that matrine, an alkaloid extracted from a Chinese herb radix sophorae, significantly inhibited the proliferation of human CML K562cells, induced cell cycle arrest in G0/G1, and promoted cell apoptosis. In the present study, we investigated the molecular mechanism of matrine in the growth inhibition of leukemia cells using K562 and HL-60 cell lines. RT-PCR and Western blot assay demonstrated that the expression of BCR/ABL in K562 and HL-60 cells was significantly inhibited by matrine treatment. Phosphorylation of MEK1, ERK1/2, and their upstream adaptor molecules Shc and SHP2 were significantly downregulated. The protein and mRNA expression of components of the ERK/MAPK signal pathway, and Bcl-xL, Cyclin D1, and c-Myc, were dramatically reduced. Conversely, the expression of p27, a negative regulator of cell cycle progression, increased after matrine treatment. These results indicated that the inhibition of ERK/MAPK and BCR/ABL signaling pathway was associated with matrineâ€™s suppressive effects on the growth of K562 and HL-60 cells. In
