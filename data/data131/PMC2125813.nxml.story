 have been collected from widely different sources and tested with regard to toxin production. Each strain produces a toxin which, on animal inoculation, gives rise to lesions comparable in every respect to those produced by the toxins previously reported on, and each toxin was neutralized by an immune (antitoxic) serum produced with one of the former toxins. The toxins obtained from the several individual strains varied in potency, the lethal dose ranging from 0.3 to 3 cc. Experiments have been made to determine the influence of fresh muscle and glucose on toxin production and the relation of acidity to toxicity in the filtrates. It has been found that the addition of fresh muscle to the medium increases the potency of the toxin fivefold. Autoclaved muscle is without effect. Beef infusion broth containing 0.2 to 1 per cent glucose gives a more potent product than sugar-free broth, while when higher percentages are employed the toxin production is lowered. There is no direct relation between acidity and toxicity, the most acid products manifesting little or no toxic action. In every medium used for culture the potency of the filtrates rapidly diminished after 24 hours' incubation, while the acidity increased or remained constant. The exception to this rule has been pointed out. The most active toxin is obtained by growing a virulent strain of the bacilli in a 0.2 or 0.3 per cent glucose broth to which fragments of fresh muscle have been added, and collecting the filtrate after from 18 to 24 hours' incubation.
