 effects of rigosertib on an MDS-derived cell line MDS-L and a myeloid leukemia cell line HL-60. Rigosertib suppressed the proliferation of both HL-60 and MDS-L cells and induced apoptosis by inhibition of the PI3 kinase/Akt pathway. As the effects on cell cycle, rigosertib treatment promoted the phosphorylation of histone H2AX and led to the DNA damage-induced G2/M arrest. In addition, an immunofluorescence staining study demonstrated the abnormal localization of aurora A kinase, suggesting that rigosertib causes perturbation of spindle assembly and deregulated mitotic patterns towards cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. We also found that rigosertib exerted growth inhibitory effects on two lymphoid cell lines, Jurkat and Ramos. We further examined the molecular pathways influenced by rigosertib from the gene expression profiling data of MDS-L cells and found a possible involvement of rigosertib treatment in the upregulation of the genes related to microtubule kinetics and the downregulation of the mRNA degradation system. The gene set enrichment analysis showed the suppression of “nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD)” as the most significantly affected gene set. These data provide a new aspect and a potential utility of rigosertib for the treatment of refractory hematopoietic malignancies.
