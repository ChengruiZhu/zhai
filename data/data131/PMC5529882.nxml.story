MicroRNAs (miRNAs/miRs) regulate the expression of target genes and are considered to be associated with human cancer. The aim of the present study was to screen novel miRNA biomarkers in esophageal cancer (EC). The miRNA expression profile GSE41268 was extracted from Gene Expression Omnibus database, and differentially expressed miRNAs between whole saliva samples from patients with EC and healthy controls were identified using the Linear Models for Microarray Data package. Then, the targets of these miRNAs were screened using the miRecords database and used to construct the regulatory network. Gene ontology and pathway enrichment analyses were performed for the target genes of differentially expressed miRNAs to predict their potential functions. A total of 18 differentially expressed miRNAs were identified in saliva samples from patients with EC, and 43 validated target genes corresponding to 7 upregulated miRNAs were identified. Then, 6 miRNAs (miR-144, miR-451, miR-98, miR-10b, miR-486-5p and miR-363) and their target genes were used to construct a regulatory network. Within the network, miR-144 may target Notch homolog 1, fibrinogen α chain and fibrinogen β chain; miR-451 may regulate murine thymoma viral oncogene homolog 1, matrix metalloproteinase (
