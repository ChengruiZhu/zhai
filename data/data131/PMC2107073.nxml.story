, and embedded in Epon 812. Thin sections show the presence of two distinct membranous populations, each of which is relatively homogeneous in size and appearance. Swollen mitochondria (∼1.5 µ in diameter), which have been stripped of their outer membranes, are largely devoid of matrix and normal matrix granules and are referred to as "ghosts." The smaller (0.2 to 0.4 µ in diameter), empty appearing, vesicular elements, derived primarily from the outer mitochondrial membrane, can be differentiated from the ghosts on the basis of their smaller size and complete absence of internal structures, especially cristae. Each membranous element is enclosed by a single, continuous membrane; the "double membrane" organization typical of intact mitochondria is not observed. These findings indicate that the outer membrane of rat-liver mitochondria is spatially dissociated from the inner mitochondrial membrane by osmotic lysis of the mitochondria in distilled water. Three parameters of structural and functional significance in freshly isolated rat-liver mitochondria have been correlated with the structural alterations observed: () integrated multienzyme functions (respiration, phosphorylation, and contraction). The data presented indicate that all mitochondrial membranes are completely conserved in the crude ghost preparation and that, in addition, about ⅓ of the matrix proteins (estimated by assays for MDH activity and protein) are retained. The study of integrated mitochondrial functions shows that a number of physiologically important multienzyme activities also are preserved in the water-washed preparation. The respiratory rate of ghosts per milligram of protein is 1.5 to 2.0 times that of intact mitochondria, which shows that the respiratory chain in the ghosts is functionally intact. The rate of phosphorylation is reduced, however, to about 25% of that measured in freshly isolated mitochondria and accounts for lowered P:O ratios using succinate as substrate (P:O ranges from 0.4 to 0.9). The phosphorylation of ADP to ATP is the only biochemical function, so far investigated, that is greatly affected by osmotic lysis. In addition, two lines of evidence suggest that the ghosts undergo an energy-dependent transformation resulting in contraction: (
