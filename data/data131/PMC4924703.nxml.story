Photoimmunotherapy is a new class of molecular targeted cancer therapy based on a monoclonal antibody (mAb) conjugated to a photosensitizer and irradiation with near-infrared (NIR) light for both imaging and therapy. Here, we sought to determine the feasibility of combining photoimmunotherapy using conjugates of human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-specific mAb-photosensitizer IR700, trastuzumab-IR700 and pertuzumab-IR700. HER2-expressing and non-expressing cells were treated with mAb-IR700 conjugates and irradiated with NIR light. Fluorescence imaging and cytotoxic effects were examined in cultured HER2-expressng cancer cell lines and in a mouse tumor xenograft model. Trastuzumab-IR700 and pertuzumab-IR700 could specifically bind to HER2 without competing, and the combination treatment of both agents yielded stronger HER2-specific IR700 fluorescence signals than with the treatment with either agent singly. A cytotoxicity assay showed that the combination treatment of both trastuzumab-IR700 and pertuzumab-IR700 followed by NIR light irradiation induced stronger cytotoxic effect than with treatment of either agent plus NIR light irradiation. Furthermore, the phototoxic and cytotoxic effects of mAb depended on HER2-specific IR700 signal intensities. Consistent with
