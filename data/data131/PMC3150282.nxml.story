A cell interacts with its environment though the thousands of proteins that are expressed on the cell's surface. A number of these proteins are involved in cellâˆ¶cell communication, a complex process where two cells establish a (transient) contact interface forming protein bonds that bridge the interface. In T cells, which are a major component of the immune system, the proteins in this interface are organised into spatial domains with small proteins segregating from large ones, a patternation that is believed to be a crucial step in the recognition of antigens by T cells. The mechanism of this patternation is still unresolved, a mechanism based on maximising the number of bonds by partitioning the interface into regions where short and long proteins can form bonds being the most promising. Here we directly compare image patterns with a mathematical theory of patternation demonstrating that there is a signature of the patternation mechanism in the image data. We developed a framework for quantitative modelling of image data in a biophysical context that can be utilised in a variety of other model validation studies. Using these methods we proved that on these images this theory is sufficient to explain the observed patternation.
