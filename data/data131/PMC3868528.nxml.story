Meiosis is the specialized cell division that produces gametes by precisely reducing the chromosome copy number from two to one. Accurate segregation of homologous chromosome pairs requires they be connected by crossing-over, the precise breakage and exchange of chromosome arms that is carried out by a process called recombination. Recombination is regulated so each pair of homologous chromosomes becomes connected by at least one crossover. We studied the roles of two recombination proteins, Rad51 and Dmc1, which can act directly to join homologous DNA molecules. Our evidence supports the idea that Dmc1 is the dominant joining activity, while Rad51 acts indirectly with other proteins to support and regulate Dmc1. Furthermore, Hed1, an inhibitor of Rad51's DNA joining activity, is also shown to enhance the efficiency of crossing-over. Cells in which Rad51 is activated to promote DNA joining in place of Dmc1 have unregulated and inefficient crossing-over that often leaves chromosome pairs without the requisite crossover. Despite these defects, most cells that use Rad51 in place of Dmc1 complete meiosis and produce high levels of crossovers. Our results indicate that compensatory processes ensure that meiotic cells accumulate high levels of crossover intermediates before progressing to the first round of chromosome segregation.
