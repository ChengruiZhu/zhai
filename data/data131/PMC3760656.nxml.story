Development of innovative high throughput technologies has enabled a variety of molecular landscapes to be interrogated with an unprecedented degree of detail. Emergence of next generation nucleotide sequencing methods, advanced proteomic techniques, and metabolic profiling approaches continue to produce a wealth of biological data that captures molecular frameworks underlying phenotype. The advent of these novel technologies has significant translational applications, as investigators can now explore molecular underpinnings of developmental states with a high degree of resolution. Application of these leading-edge techniques to patient samples has been successfully used to unmask nuanced molecular details of disease vs healthy tissue, which may provide novel targets for palliative intervention. To enhance such approaches, concomitant development of algorithms to reprogram differentiated cells in order to recapitulate pluripotent capacity offers a distinct advantage to advancing diagnostic methodology. Bioinformatic deconvolution of several “-omic” layers extracted from reprogrammed patient cells, could, in principle, provide a means by which the evolution of individual pathology can be developmentally monitored. Significant logistic challenges face current implementation of this novel paradigm of patient treatment and care, however, several of these limitations have been successfully addressed through continuous development of cutting edge
