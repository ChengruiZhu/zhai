Smoking is the leading preventable cause of disease, disability, and premature death. Nicotine, the main psychoactive drug in tobacco, is one of the most heavily used addictive substances, and its continued use is driven through activation of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs). Despite harmful consequences, it is difficult to quit smoking because of its positive effects on mood and cognition that are strong reinforcers contributing to addiction. Furthermore, a formidable challenge for the treatment of nicotine addiction is the high vulnerability to relapse after abstinence. There is no currently available smoking cessation product able to achieve a >20% smoking cessation rate after 52 wk, and there are no medications that directly target the relapse process. We report here that the α7nAChR forms a protein complex with the NMDA glutamate receptor (NMDAR) through a direct protein–protein interaction. Chronic nicotine exposure promotes α7nAChR–NMDAR complex formation. Interestingly, administration of an interfering peptide that disrupts the α7nAChR–NMDAR complex decreased extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) activity and blocked cue-induced reinstatement of nicotine seeking in rat models of relapse, without affecting nicotine self-administration or locomotor activity. Our results may provide a novel therapeutic target for the development of medications for preventing nicotine relapse.
