The site frequency spectrum (SFS, i.e., the distribution of allele frequencies) is a summary of natural variation, used to study demographic history and natural selection. Here, we extended the SFS by conditioning on phylogenetic divergence patterns. We refer to this extension as the “phylogenetically-conditioned SFS” or cSFS. Exploring the determinants of the cSFS revealed two main findings. First, we found that mutations that have been independently fixed in another species are more likely to be benign for contemporary humans if the fixation occurred in a closely related species. The background on which a mutation occurs is therefore an important feature to consider when predicting the fitness consequences of a mutation. Second, we found that the SFS is substantially affected by repeat mutations within the human population. The extent of repeat mutations implies that some sites must have particularly high mutation rates, beyond the known variation across the different possible nucleotide changes. Our observations contradict the “infinite sites” mutation model, which is commonly used in population genetic analyses, and imply that future SFS-based analyses of human populations should account for mutation rate variation.
