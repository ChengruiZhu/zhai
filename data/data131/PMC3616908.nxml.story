Human cells activate the DNA damage response (DDR) to repair DNA damage and to prevent cells with DNA damage from proliferating. Alterations to the DDR are strongly implicated in the development of cancer. Using the budding yeast model system, we have studied how the regulation of the key DDR component Rad9 is integrated into cell cycle control. The cyclin-dependent kinase Cdc28 that regulates the yeast cell cycle also extensively phosphorylates Rad9 during cell cycle progression. We show here that Cdc28 controls Rad9 function in the activation of the important downstream DNA damage effector kinase Chk1. Two sites of phosphorylation in the N-terminus of Rad9 are crucial for the physical interaction between Rad9 and Chk1 regulated by Cdc28. We propose a novel model for Chk1 activation whereby a subset of Rad9 and Chk1 interacts constitutively in the absence of DNA damage. The Rad9/Chk1 complex is recruited to sites of DNA damage where activation of Chk1 involves additional DDRâ€“specific protein kinases. Human cells contain multiple Rad9-like proteins that are also known to be cell cycle phosphorylated in the absence of exogenous DNA damage, suggesting that our observations may have important implications for DDR regulation in human cells.
