Non-invasive cardiac monitoring has well-established indications and protocols. Telemetry is often overused leading to a shortage of tele-beds and an increment of hospital expenses. In some cases, patients are kept on telemetry longer than the indicated length because providers are unaware of its ongoing use. We investigated the effect of reminder pop-ups, incorporated into an electronic medical record (EMR), on minimizing the use of telemetry. Three regional hospitals implemented an electronic pop-up reminder for discontinuing the use of telemetry when no longer indicated. A retrospective analysis of data for patients on telemetry, outside of the intensive care unit (ICU), was conducted and comparisons were drawn from pre- and post-implementation periods. A composite analysis of the number of days on telemetry was calculated using the Kruskal-Wallis test. With the implementation of the pop-up reminder, the median number of days on telemetry was significantly lower in 2016 than in 2015 (2.25 vs 3.61 days, p < 0.0001). Overutilization of telemetry is widely recognized, despite not being warranted in non-ICU hospitalizations. The implementation of a pop-up reminder built into the electronic medical record system reduced the overuse of telemetry by 37% between the two time periods studied.
