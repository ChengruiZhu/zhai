Fifteen children who met the inclusion criteria were included for the final analysis. The age of the children at presentation ranged 3-15 years (median 6.3 years). All the children presented with prolonged or recurrent seizures occurring 1-12 days (median 4 days) after the onset of fever. Eight children had SRSE while seven children had refractory seizures with encephalopathy. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis was done in all the children in the acute phase, and the cell count ranged 0-12 cells/μL (median 2 cells/μL) with normal sugar and protein levels. Initial neuroimaging done in all children (MRI in 10 and CT in 5), and it was normal in 13 children. Treatment modalities included multiple antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) (4-9 drugs) (median 5 drugs). Midazolam (MDZ) infusion was administered in seven patients. Eight patients required barbiturate coma to suppress the seizure activity. The duration of the barbiturate coma ranged 2-90 days (median 3 days). Steroids were used in 14 children and intravenous immunoglobulin (2 g/kg) in 7 children. Three children died in the acute phase. All children were maintained on multiple AEDs till the last follow-up, the number of AEDs ranged 1-6 (median 5 AEDs). The patients with super refractory status in the acute phase were found to be more severely disabled at the follow-up; the median score of these patients on the Glasgow Outcome Scale (GOS) was 2 compared to 5 in the RSE group.
