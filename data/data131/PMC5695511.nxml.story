Our previous study revealed that mesoporous Ca-Si-based materials exhibited excellent osteoconduction because dissolved ions could form a layer of hydroxycarbonate apatite on the surface of the materials. However, the biological mechanisms underlying bone regeneration were largely unknown. The main aim of this study was to evaluate the osteogenic ability of large-pore mesoporous Ca-Si-based bioceramics (LPMSCs) by alkaline phosphatase assay, real-time PCR analysis, von Kossa, and alizarin red assay. Compared with large-pore mesoporous silica (LPMS), LPMSCs had a better effect on the osteogenic differentiation of dental pulp cells. LPMSC-2 and LPMSC-3 with higher calcium possessed better osteogenic abilities than LPMSC-1, which may be related to the calcium-sensing receptor pathway. Furthermore, the loading capacity for recombinant human platelet-derived growth factor-BB was satisfactory in LPMSCs. In vivo, the areas of new bone formation in the calvarial defect repair were increased in the LPMSC-2 and LPMSC-3 groups compared with the LPMSC-1 and LPMS groups. We concluded that LPMSC-2 and LPMSC-3 possessed both excellent osteogenic abilities and satisfactory loading capacities, which may be attributed to their moderate Ca/Si molar ratio. Therefore, LPMSCs with moderate Ca/Si molar ratio might be potential alterative grafts for craniomaxillofacial bone regeneration.
