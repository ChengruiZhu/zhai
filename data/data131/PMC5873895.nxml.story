Pleomorphic adenoma gene like-2 (PLAGL2) is a zinc finger protein transcription factor, which is upregulated and serves an oncogenic function in multiple human malignancies, including colorectal cancer (CRC). First, reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) was used to detect the expression levels of PLAGL2 in CRC tissues and normal tissues. Then, bioinformatics analysis, RT-qPCR, western blotting, luciferase reporter assays and RNA-binding protein immunoprecipitation assays were performed to explore whether the underlying mechanisms, including copy number variation (CNV), microRNAs (miRNAs/miRs) and RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) led to the abnormal expression of PLAGL2. Finally, cell counting kit-8 assays, Transwell assays and xenograft models were used to detect carcinogenesis-associated characteristics based on the 3′-untranslated region (3′-UTR) of PLAGL2. In the present study, PLAGL2 was revealed to be upregulated in CRC tissues compared with normal CRC tissues. CNV was one of the causes leading to the upregulation of PLAGL2. miRNA, including downregulated miR-486-5p, and RBPs, including upregulated human antigen R (HuR), were other key underlying causes. In addition, PLAGL2 3′-UTR was revealed to promote the progression of CRC
