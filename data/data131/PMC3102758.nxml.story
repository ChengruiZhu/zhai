When confronted with different alternatives, animals can respond either based on their pre-established habits, or by considering the short- and long-term consequences of each option. Whereas habitual decision making is fast, goal-directed thinking is a time-consuming task. Instead, habits are inflexible after being consolidated, but goal-directed decision making can rapidly adapt the animal's strategy after a change in environmental conditions. Based on these features of the two decision making systems, we suggest a computational model using the reinforcement learning framework, that makes a balance between the speed of decision making and behavioural flexibility. The behaviour of the model is consistent with the observation that at the early stages of learning, animals behave in a goal-directed way (flexible, but slow), but after extensive learning, their responses become habitual (inflexible, but fast). Moreover, the model explains that the animal's reaction time must decrease through the course of learning, as the habitual system takes control over behaviour. The model also attributes a functional role to the tonic activity of dopamine neurons in balancing the competition between the habitual and the goal-directed systems.
