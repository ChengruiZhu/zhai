 = 5). The Group I children (one still awaiting reconstruction) underwent early rectal reconstruction followed by expectant management of the urogenital apparatus. The 18 referred cases had multiple problems, chiefly urogenital, of congenital or iatrogenic origin. While urinary reconstruction included bladder augmentation, ileal neobladder, bladder neck closure, and ureteric reimplantation, the foundation of urinary management was intermittent catheterization through mitrofanoff stoma and the avoidance of any dissection of the cloacal common channel. Surgery on the genital tracts included drainage of hydrocolpos, perineal surgery for low vaginae and abdominoperineal vaginoplasty for high vaginae in the peripubertal period with or without bowel supplementation. Spontaneous voiding was maintained in 17 of 25 (68%) Group I girls (including one death later from intestinal complications), 7 of 13 (54%), Group IIA girls, and 1 of 5 (20%) Group IIB girls. Painless menstruation was noted in eight postpubertal girls, three through the cloacal channel (awaiting reconstruction) and five through the reconstructed vagina. Most of the children are on a bowel management program for fecal cleanliness with washouts through the neoanus or Malone's stoma.
