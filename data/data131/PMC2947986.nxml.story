Although cardiovascular events, such as myocardial infarction and stroke, usually occur at later ages, it is known that the atherogenic process begins much earlier in life. Detection of subclinical atherosclerosis would therefore offer the means to identify individuals who are at increased risk of developing cardiovascular events. What remains unclear is the relative contribution of genetic variation to the development of the early stages of atherosclerosis. To address this question, we searched for combinations of both genetic and clinical determinants that are the most predictive of the progression of subclinical carotid atherosclerosis in a sample of 1,027 young adults, aged between 24â€“39 years, from the Finnish general population (The Cardiovascular Risk in Young Finns Study). We demonstrate here, for the first time in a population-based follow-up study, a predictive relationship between individual's genotypic variation and early signs of atherosclerosis, which cannot be explained by conventional cardiovascular risk factors, such as obesity and elevated blood pressure levels. The predictive modeling framework facilitates the usability of genetic information by identifying informative panels of variants, along with conventional risk factors, which may prove to be useful in early detection and management of atherosclerosis. The clinical implications of these findings remain to be studied.
