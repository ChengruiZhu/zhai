Epilepsy is a neuropsychiatric disorder associated with religiosity and spirituality. Nasal drug delivery systems are the best for diseases related to brain. In older times RishiMuni, ancient scholars and physicians used to recommend Hawan for mental peace and well being. Gayatri Mantra also tells that sughandhim (aroma, fragrance) puushtivardhanam (gives rise to good health). Om triambkum yajamahe, sughandhim puushtivardhanam, urvarukmev vandhanaat, mrityu mokshay mamritaat! Hawan is a scientific experiment in which special herbs (Hawan Samagri) are offered in the fire of medicinal woods ignited in a specially designed fire pit called agniku√±da. Hawan seems to be designed by the ancient scholars to fight with the diseases of the brain. Our metadata analysis demonstrates that the components of Hawan are having a number of volatile oils that are specifically useful for epilepsy through one or the other mechanism of action. Due to high temperature of fire the vapors of these oils enter into the central nervous system through nasal route. The routine of performing Hawan might keep the threshold value of the therapeutic components in the body and help in preventing epilepsy. In the present manuscript authors have tried to highlight and integrate the modern and ancient concepts for treatment and prevention of epilepsy.
