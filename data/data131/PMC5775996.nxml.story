Several techniques have been proposed to prevent hypotension in obstetric patients. Ephedrine and phenylephrine are individually used to prevent maternal hypotension; however, each has its own drawbacks. Some researchers have reported that the infusion of combined ephedrine and phenylephrine immediately after spinal anesthesia for cesarean delivery reduces the incidence of maternal hypotension. Other studies have indicated that the combination is not superior to the infusion of an individual agent. The present study aimed to evaluate the effect of prophylactic infusion of ephedrine and phenylephrine before the induction of spinal anesthesia for cesarean section on maternal hemodynamic. In a randomized, double-blinded clinical trial study, 90 pregnant women that underwent elective cesarean delivery under spinal anesthesia were recruited. Before the spinal anesthesia, the infusion of combined ephedrine and phenylephrine during 15 minutes (study group) or serum NaCl 0.9% (placebo group) was performed. Hemodynamic parameters and fetal blood gas were recorded. The data were analyzed using the SPSS software, version 16.0. The results showed that hypotension and bradycardia after spinal anesthesia were less in the study group. The need for vasopressors and inotropes to treat hypotension, nausea, and vomiting were higher in the placebo group. First- and fifth-minute Apgar scores were higher in the study group. The prophylactic infusion of low-dose ephedrine and phenylephrine before spinal anesthesia for cesarean delivery can be used to decrease the frequency and severity of maternal hypotension and its side effects to the mother and neonate.
