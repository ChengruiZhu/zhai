Functionally skinned and electrochemically shunted myocytes were prepared by perfusing rat hearts with collagenase in order to obtain a technically improved measurement of sarcomere dynamics and to evaluate the role of sarcoplasmic reticulum in situ with respect to contractile activation. In the presence of micromolar calcium, the myocytes exhibited phasic and propagated contraction waves beginning at one end and proceeding along the myocyte. Beating rates, the propagation velocity of the activation wave, and single sarcomere shortening and relaxation velocities were obtained by manual or automated analysis of 16-mm film recorded at 170 frames/s from a camera attached to a microscope that was equipped with a temperature-controlled stage. In parallel experiments, calcium accumulation by the sarcoplasmic reticulum of the myocytes in situ was measured by direct isotopic tracer methods. The frequency (10-38 min-1) of spontaneous contractions, the velocity (1.9-7.4 microns . s-1) of sarcomere shortening, and the velocity (1.7-6.8 microns . s-1) of sarcomere relaxation displayed identical temperature dependences (Q10 = 2.2), which are similar to that of the calcium pump of sarcoplasmic reticulum and are consistent with a rate limit imposed by enzyme-catalyzed mechanisms on all these parameters. On the other hand, the velocity (77- 159 microns . s-1) of sequential sarcomere activation displayed a lower temperature dependence (Q10 = 1.5), which is consistent with a diffusion-limited and self-propagating release of calcium from one sarcomere to the other. The phasic contractile activity of the dissociated myocytes was inhibited by 10(-8)-10(6) M ryanodine (and not by myolemmal calcium blockers) under conditions in which calcium accumulation by sarcoplasmic reticulum in situ was demonstrated to proceed optimally. The effect of ryanodine is attributed to an interaction of this drug with sarcotubular structures, producing inhibition of calcium release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum. The consequent lack of sarcomere activation underlines the role of sarcoplasmic reticulum uptake and release in the phasic contractile activation of the electrochemically shunted myocytes.
