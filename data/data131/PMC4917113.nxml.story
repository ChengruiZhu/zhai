Beta-lactamases are bacterial proteins largely responsible for resistance to beta-lactam antibiotics and so pose a significant challenge to modern medicine. Whilst there are many studies cataloguing beta-lactamases, antibiotic screening has not always been consistent or comprehensive, causing confusion in the classification of these proteins and difficulty in recognising bacteria with different resistance profiles. We therefore developed strategies for automatically and consistently classifying distinct classes and types of beta-lactamases, having particular antibiotic resistance profiles. Our methods focus mainly on the sequences of the beta-lactamases, as for most new bacterial strains we will only know the sequence. We have classified all sequenced beta-lactamases stored in major public repositories into classes. We then mainly focus on the Class A beta-lactamases as these are responsible for most of the resistance to clinically relevant antibiotics. We applied methods to pinpoint key sequence sites where changes result in new antibiotic resistance properties. Understanding which sites confer resistance is important for recognizing whether new evolving strains can evade current antibiotic regimes. Our classification methods allowed us to classify 151 Class A serine beta-lactamase types and to recognize a new type of Class A beta-lactamase in a bacteria found in a drain sample.
