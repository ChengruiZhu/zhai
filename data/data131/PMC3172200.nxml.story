Induction of protective immunity involves the expression of inflammatory cytokines, proteins that mediate and respond to immune signals. However, excessive cytokine induction can lead to disease, including, at very high levels, lethal toxic shock. Staphylococcal and streptococcal superantigens are a broad family of bacterial protein toxins that induce such a lethal cytokine storm, orders of magnitude higher in intensity than that elicited during normal immune responses. A key participant in every immune response is the costimulatory receptor CD28, which forms a protein dimer to mediate the immune response. Hitherto, CD28 was not known to bind microbial components. Here, we show that superantigens co-opt CD28 as their receptor and that to induce a cytokine storm, superantigens must bind directly into the dimer interface of CD28. The interaction between CD28 and the bacterial superantigen can be blocked with peptidesâ€”short protein fragments that mimic the contact domains in the intact superantigen or in CD28. These peptides attenuate inflammatory cytokine gene induction and thus protect animals from lethal toxic shock. Our finding that CD28 is a receptor for the superantigen toxins broadens the scope of microbial pathogen recognition mechanisms and provides a novel approach for designing therapeutics that protect against toxic shock.
