Odorant receptor (OR) gene choice is a paradigmatic example of transcriptional regulation in which each olfactory sensory neuron selects a single OR from a repertoire of over 1,000 genes. Two mechanistic models of OR choice have been proposed. One postulates the existence of a specialized transcriptional machinery that selects just one OR allele, while a second, kinetic model proposes that OR chromatin is intrinsically nonpermissive, such that inefficient activation during a critical window of time restricts expression to a single OR allele. Here, we used a transgenic approach in mice in which we inserted a conditionally regulated exogenous promoter into an OR locus by homologous recombination in embryonic stem cells. The resulting novel mouse lines allowed the functional interrogation of the OR locus in vivo during development of the olfactory epithelium, enabling us to directly test models of OR choice. Using this experimental strategy we found that OR loci are indeed slow to activate and that the subsequent phenomenon of spatial restriction of OR expression is accomplished by repression. We also observed a developmental shutdown of OR loci concomitant with expression of the OR repertoire. Together, these experiments provide prima facie evidence for a kinetic model of initiation of OR gene choice, coupled with repression of nonselected OR alleles.
