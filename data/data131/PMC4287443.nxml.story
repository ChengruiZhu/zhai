All organisms must respond to changes in their external environment such as exposure to different stresses. The availability of genome sequences and post-genomic technologies has enabled the analysis of these adaptive responses at the molecular level in terms of altered gene expression profiles. However, relatively few studies have focused on how cells regulate the translation of mRNA into protein in response to stress, despite its fundamental role in gene expression pathways. In this study, we show that a previously identified RNA-binding protein called Slf1p plays a major role in mRNA-specific regulation of translation during oxidative stress conditions and is necessary to promote the translation of stress-responsive mRNAs. This protein is a member of the so-called “La-related” family of proteins that have not been well characterized, although they are conserved throughout evolution. Exposure to oxidants is known to cause a general down-regulation of protein synthesis, although many stress response proteins are able to overcome this inhibition and increase their protein levels following stress by as yet unknown mechanisms. Our experiments offer one possible explanation, as they show that Slf1p plays a critical role in enhancing translation of many of these proteins, including many that are necessary for the cellular stress response.
