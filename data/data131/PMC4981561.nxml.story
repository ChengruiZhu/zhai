Urbanization is a hazardous process because it affects health population due to changes in diet and physical activity patterns. This study aimed to determine the effect of migration on the incidence of hypertension. Participants of the PERU MIGRANT study, i.e. rural, urban, and rural-to-urban migrants were re-evaluated after five years from baseline. The outcome was incidence of hypertension; and the exposures were study group and other well-known risk factors. Incidence rates, relative risks (RR), and population attributable fractions were calculated. At baseline, 201 (20.4%), 589 (59.5%), and 199 (20.1%) were rural, rural-to-urban migrant and urban subjects, respectively. Overall mean age was 47.9 (SD±12.0) years, and 522 (52.9%) were females. Hypertension prevalence at baseline was 16.0% (95% CI 13.7%–18.3%), being more common in urban group; whereas pre-hypertension was more prevalent in rural participants (p<0.001). Follow-up rate at 5 years was 94%, 895 participants were re-assessed and 33 (3.3%) deaths were recorded. Overall incidence of hypertension was 1.73 (95%CI 1.36–2.20) per 100 person-years. In multivariable model and compared to the urban group, rural group had a greater risk of developing hypertension (RR=3.58; 95%CI 1.42–9.06). Population attributable fractions showed high waist circumference as the leading risk factor for the hypertension development in rural (19.1%), migrant (27.9%), and urban (45.8%) participants. Subjects from rural settings are at higher risk to develop hypertension relative to rural-urban migrant or urban groups. Central obesity was the leading risk factor for hypertension incidence in the three population groups.
