Phospholipid hydroperoxide glutathione peroxidase (PHGPx) is an intracellular antioxidant enzyme that directly reduces peroxidized phospholipids. PHGPx is transcribed from one gene into three types of mRNA, mitochondrial, non-mitochondrial and nucleolar PHGPx by alternative transcription. In this review, we focus on our recent experiments on the regulation of promoter activity of the types of PHGPx and on the novel strategy of functional analysis of a PHGPx knockout mice model using the transgenic rescue method and Cre-LoxP system. PHGPx is especially high in testis and spermatozoa. A deficiency is implicated in human infertility. We established spermatocyte-specific PHGPx knockout (KO) mice using a Cre-loxP system. Targeted disruption of all exons of the PHGPx gene in mice by homologous recombination caused embryonic lethality at 7.5 days post coitum. The PHGPx-loxP transgene rescued PHGPx KO mice from embryonic lethality. These rescued floxed PHGPx mice were mated with spermatocyte specific Cre expressing mice. All the spermatocyte-specific PHGPx KO male mice were infertile and displayed a significant decrease in the number of spermatozoa and significant reductions in forward motility by mitochondrial dysfunction of spermatozoa. These results demonstrate that depletion of PHGPx in spermatozoa may be one of the causes of male infertility in mice and humans.
