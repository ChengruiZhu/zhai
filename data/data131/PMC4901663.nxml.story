The average age of participants was 20.1 years (Range: 18-23). Football, soccer and baseball were the most represented sports among participants, but a wide variety were present. Of the 157 surveys administered, 106 of participants (68%) knew that the ACL was a ligament. The majority of participants (63%) thought it would take 8-12 months to return to sport after an injury, but 31% said an athlete could return in less than 6 months (Range: 2 to 15 months). On average, the participants thought 64% of athletes could return to play in their sport after an ACL injury and reconstruction, but only 45% could return to their previous level of play. However, several participants (8%) believed greater than 80% of athletes could return to their previous level of play after an ACL reconstruction. Only 11% of respondents knew that a knee brace cannot prevent ACL injury. Most participants (82%) said that if they had an ACL injury they would undergo reconstructive surgery. Only 26% of participants knew that an athlete with an ACL injury was at an increased risk for an injury to their contralateral ACL. Furthermore, about half of the participants (54%) thought that on-field performance would not improve following an ACL injury and reconstruction. The most common source of participantsâ€™ knowledge of ACL injury was from a friend or family member (71%). Far fewer participants gained at least some of their knowledge from the internet (32%), television (27%) or their physician/surgeon (29%).
