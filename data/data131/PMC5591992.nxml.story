The Integral Quality Monitoring (IQM) System is a real-time beam output verifying system that validates the integrity and accuracy of patient treatment plan (TP) data during radiation treatment. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the sensitivity of the IQM to errors in segment using EGSnrc/BEAMnrc Monte Carlo (MC) codes. Sensitivity analysis (SA) techniques were applied to study the significance of small alterations of field sizes (segments) on the IQM signal response. One hundred and eighty multileaf segments were analyzed with methods that include scatter plots (SP), brute force, variance-based (VAR), and standard regression coefficient SA. The segments were altered randomly within ±1, ±2, and ±3 mm leaf steps for 10 MV photon beams. SP analysis gradient and VAR maximum index are 1.045 and 0.556 for the smallest segment while the largest segment has the value of 0.018 and 0.504, respectively. The brute force and standard regression displayed maximum sensitivity indices around the unaltered segments. These tests conclusively indicated that the IQM was more sensitive to alterations of small segments compared to larger segments. This is important since small segment variation will cause a higher dose output variation that should be picked up during online beam monitoring.
