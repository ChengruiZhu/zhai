Most organisms are occasionally exposed to adverse environmental conditions, and can express protective features that help them mitigate the harmful effects of environmental stresses, such as infections, exposure to UV light or chemicals, or sudden habitat changes. Interestingly, a number of recent experiments with unicellular microbes revealed marked variability in the responses to such stress between genetically identical individuals. Some individuals express protective features even in the absence of stress; others do not express these features even if stress reaches substantial levels. Why is stress response, which seems so important for organisms, not more tightly controlled? One possibility is that this variation can help organisms mediate between costs and benefits of protection. These protective features are usually expressed in response to environmental signals that indicate stress. However, most signals are not absolutely reliable. Sometimes stressful conditions will not be preceded by a signal; other times, a signal might not be followed by stress. We used analytical and individual-based models to investigate how a probabilistic expression of stress response can evolve in response to unreliable signals, and in how the ecological setting influences the evolutionary dynamics.
