High blood pressure, or hypertension, is a leading cause of stroke, heart disease, and kidney failure. Hypertension is due to factors such as older age, high salt intake, obesity, and genetic susceptibility. The genetic variants responsible for increased susceptibility to hypertension are largely unknown but are likely to include those that increase salt retention and blood vessel tone. Here the authors show that populations around the world differ in susceptibility to hypertension such that populations from hot, wet environments are more susceptible to hypertension than populations from cold environments. This differential susceptibility is likely due to selection during the human out-of-Africa expansion 50,000 to 100,000 y ago. Furthermore, the authors show that latitude and one of the genetic variants that increase susceptibility to hypertension account for a major portion of worldwide variation in blood pressure. Therefore, the current epidemic of hypertension is due to ancestral susceptibility interacting with the new risk factors of the modern period, such as high salt intake and obesity. Populations differ in susceptibility to these risk factors, however. This differential susceptibility is due to our history of adaptation to climate.
