Pyramidal neurons in the hippocampus are crucially involved in learning and memory functions, but the ways in which they contribute to the processing of sensory inputs and their internal representation remain mostly unclear. The principal neurons of the CA1 region of the hippocampus are surrounded by at least 21 different types of interneurons. This feature, together with the fact that CA1 pyramidal dendrites associate two major glutamatergic inputs arriving from the entorhinal cortex, makes it laborious to track the ‘how’ and ‘what’ of synaptic integration. The present study tries to shed light on the ‘what’, that is, the information content of the CA1 discharge pattern. Using a detailed biophysical CA1 neuron model, we show that the output of the model neuron contains spatial and temporal features of the incoming synaptic input. This information lies in the temporal pattern of the inter-spike intervals produced during the bursting activity which is induced by the temporal coincidence of the two activated synaptic streams. Our findings suggest that CA1 pyramidal neurons may be capable of capturing features of the ongoing network activity via the use of a temporal code for information transfer.
