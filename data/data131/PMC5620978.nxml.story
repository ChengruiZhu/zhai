The century-old fluoresceins
and rhodamines persist as flexible
scaffolds for fluorescent and fluorogenic compounds. Extensive exploration
of these xanthene dyes has yielded general structure–activity
relationships where the development of new probes is limited only
by imagination and organic chemistry. In particular, replacement of
the xanthene oxygen with silicon has resulted in new red-shifted Si-fluoresceins
and Si-rhodamines, whose high brightness and photostability enable
advanced imaging experiments. Nevertheless, efforts to tune the chemical
and spectral properties of these dyes have been hindered by difficult
synthetic routes. Here, we report a general strategy for the efficient
preparation of Si-fluoresceins and Si-rhodamines from readily synthesized
bis(2-bromophenyl)silane intermediates. These dibromides undergo metal/bromide
exchange to give bis-aryllithium or bis(aryl Grignard) intermediates,
which can then add to anhydride or ester electrophiles to afford a
variety of Si-xanthenes. This strategy enabled efficient (3–5
step) syntheses of known and novel Si-fluoresceins, Si-rhodamines,
and related dye structures. In particular, we discovered that previously
inaccessible tetrafluorination of the bottom aryl ring of the Si-rhodamines
resulted in dyes with improved visible absorbance in solution, and
a convenient derivatization through fluoride-thiol substitution. This
modular, divergent synthetic method will expand the palette of accessible
xanthenoid dyes across the visible spectrum, thereby pushing further
the frontiers of biological imaging.
