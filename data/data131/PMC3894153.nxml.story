Peroxisomes are small organelles that must continually import matrix proteins to contribute to cholesterol and bile acid synthesis, among other important functions. Cargo matrix proteins are shuttled to the peroxisomal membrane, but the only source of energy that has been identified to translocate the cargo into the peroxisome is consumed during the removal of the shuttle protein. Ubiquitin is used to recycle peroxisomal shuttle proteins, but is more generally used in cells to signal degradation of damaged or unneeded cellular components. How shuttle removal and cargo translocation are coupled energetically has been difficult to determine directly, so we investigate how different models of coupling would affect the measurable levels of ubiquitin on mammalian peroxisomes. We find that for the simplest models of coupling, ubiquitin levels decrease as cargo levels decrease. Conversely, for a novel cooperative model of coupling we find that ubiquitin levels increase as cargo levels decrease. This effect could allow the cell to degrade peroxisomes when they are not used, or to avoid degrading peroxisomes as cargo levels increase. Regardless of which model is found to be right, we have shown that ubiquitination levels of peroxisomes should respond to the changing traffic of matrix proteins into peroxisomes.
