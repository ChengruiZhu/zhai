Many large-scale mathematical models describe metabolism to understand how microbes and other organisms (including humans) function and interact with each other and with their environment. Making these models is extremely time- and effort-intensive; it requires gathering and combining information from many sources, including the organism’s genome sequence, biological databases, scientific literature, and expert advice. The exact procedure and resources used depend on the model creators’ expertise and research interests, such that independently created models for the same organism are often very different and can hardly be compared. However, each model typically contains unique information that is ‘lost’ when working with a different model. To integrate the available knowledge, we developed a computational tool to build consensus metabolic models. Our tool—COMMGEN- combines independently generated models by matching identical parts and resolving differences between inconsistent parts. We apply our tool to four sets of models of different organisms. In all these sets, COMMGEN identified and resolved hundreds of inconsistencies. COMMGEN can be generally applied to standardize and improve models of metabolism, in particular for complex scenarios, such as those involving microbial communities and host-pathogen interactions.
