 The decrease in threshold shown by the eye during dark adaptation proceeds in two steps. The first is rapid, short in duration, and small in extent. The second is slow, prolonged, and large. The first is probably due to cone function; the second to rod function. In centrally located fields the two parts of adaptation change differently with area. With small, foveal fields the first part dominates and only traces of the second part appear. As the area increases the first part changes a little, while the second part covers an increasing range of intensities and appears sooner in time. Measurements with an annulus field covering only the circumference of a 20° circle show most of the characteristics of a 20° whole field centrally located. Similarly a 2° field located at different distances from the center shows dark adaptation characteristics essentially like those of large centrally located fields whose edges correspond to the position of the central field. Evidently the behavior in dark adaptation of centrally located fields of different size is determined in the main not by area as area, but by the fact that the retina gradually changes in sensitivity from center to periphery, and therefore the larger the field the farther it reaches into peripheral regions of permanently greater sensibility.
