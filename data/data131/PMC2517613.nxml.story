Fluorescence biosensors have been widely used to report the spatial and temporal activity of target molecules in live cells. However, biosensors can move independently of the target molecule and carry its signal to other subcellular locations. Therefore, the observed images appear to be the combination of the target molecular activity and the artifacts introduced by the movement of the biosensors (mainly due to diffusion). The intriguing question is how to estimate and exclude the movement effect of biosensors from the observed fluorescent images and to reconstruct the real activity map of the target molecules. The Src molecule plays important roles in cell adhesion, migration, and cancer invasion. In this paper, we developed a novel computational method to analyze and simulate the movement of the Src biosensor, which was then subtracted from the original fluorescent images. With this computational method, we observed discrete clusters of high Src activity at relatively stationary locations on the plasma membrane. Therefore, our results highlight the coordination of molecular activities in space and time. In addition to Src, our computational method can be used to reconstruct the activity map of other signaling molecules.
