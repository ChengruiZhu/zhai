A low oxygen condition, called hypoxia, often occurs in tumor masses and generally correlates with worse prognosis. Cells in a tumor react to low oxygen levels with a metabolism modification induced by the activation of hypoxia inducible factors (HIFs) through dimerization with a partner protein and binding to a DNA target. Disrupting this protein-protein interaction could be a potential therapeutic strategy, but directly interfering with dimer formation can be troublesome because of the difficulty to design drugs that bind to protein interfaces. However, ligands that bind internal protein cavities can indirectly perturb the interfaces reducing dimers stability. Albeit protein crystallography had offered a detailed static picture of a HIF dimer bound to candidate inhibitors, it is not able to describe either the perturbation caused by binding or the molecular mechanism of dimer destabilization. Here we exploit molecular dynamics to identify the crucial interfaces in the HIF dimer stabilization and, by comparing the results obtained in the bound and unbound forms, we reveal the mechanism of ligand inhibition at atomic detail. All these findings will guide toward the design of improved dimerization inhibitors, to contrast cell survival in tumor masses.
