Enhancing Quality Interventions Promoting Healthy Sexuality is a randomized controlled trial testing Getting To Outcomes (GTO), a 2-year implementation support intervention. It compares 16 Boys and Girls Club sites implementing Making Proud Choices (MPC, control group), a structured teen pregnancy prevention evidence-based program with 16 similar sites implementing MPC augmented with GTO (intervention group). All sites received training and manuals typical for MPC. GTO has its own manuals, training, and onsite technical assistance (TA) to help practitioners complete key programming practices specified by GTO. During the first year, TA providers helped the intervention group adopt, plan, and deliver MPC. This group then received training on the evaluation and quality improvement steps of GTO, including feedback reports summarizing their data, which were used in a TA-facilitated quality improvement process that yielded revised plans for the second MPC implementation. This paper presents results regarding GTOâ€™s impact on performance of the sites (i.e., how well key programming practices were carried out), fidelity of MPC implementation, and the relationship between amount of TA support, performance, and fidelity. Performance was measured using ratings made from a standardized, structured interview conducted with participating staff at all 32 Boys and Girls Clubs sites after the first and second years of MPC implementation. Multiple elements of fidelity (adherence, classroom delivery, dosage) were assessed at all sites by observer ratings and attendance logs.
