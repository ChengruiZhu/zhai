Although many efforts have recently contributed to improve our knowledge of molecular pathogenesis of multiple myeloma (MM), the role and significance of long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) in plasma cells (PC) malignancies remains virtually absent. To this aim, we developed a custom annotation pipeline of microarray data investigating lncRNA expression in PCs from 20 monoclonal gammopathies of undetermined significance, 33 smoldering MM, 170 MM, and 36 extra-medullary MMs/plasma cell leukemia patients, and 9 healthy donors. Our study identified 31 lncRNAs deregulated in tumor samples compared to normal controls; among these, the upregulation of MALAT1 appeared associated in MM patients with molecular pathways involving cell cycle regulation, p53-mediated DNA damage response, and mRNA maturation processes. Furthermore, we found 21 lncRNAs whose expression were progressively deregulated trough the more aggressive stages of PC dyscrasia, suggesting a possible role in the progression of the disease. Finally, in the context of molecular heterogeneity of MM, we identified a transcriptional fingerprint in hyperdiploid patients, characterized by the upregulation of lncRNAs/pseudogenes related to ribosomal protein genes, known to be upregulated in this molecular group. Overall, the data provides an important resource for future studies on the functions of lncRNAs in the pathology.
