The treatment and prevention of osteoporosis involve great challenges. Nonpharmacological and supportive therapy procedures, sport, and physical exercises seem to prevent bone loss and improve bone mass. In the present study, we examined the effect of whole-body vertical vibration (WBVV) on femoral intertrochanteric bone quality in the rat osteoporosis model. Sixty female Sprague–Dawley rats, 3-month old, were ovariectomized (OVX) or sham-operated. After 3 months, each group was divided into two subgroups. In one of the subgroups, rats were treated with WBVV at 90 Hz (3.9 g) for 35 days; the second subgroup remained untreated. After killing the animals, biomechanical strength and trabecular bone architecture of the proximal region of femurs were analyzed. New cortical bone appositions and mineral density of femurs were additionally measured. Treatment with WBVV resulted in improved biomechanical properties. Maximal load and stiffness of the intertrochanteric region of femurs after WBVV were significantly enhanced. Maximal load and stiffness in treated OVX animals reached the levels observed in untreated sham rats. WBVV significantly improved all measured histomorphometric parameters in the trabecular area. Treated rats showed significantly improved mineral content in ashed femurs compared to untreated animals. A comparison of widths of fluorescence bands in cortical bone of subtrochanteric cross sections did not show any significant differences between the groups after WBVV. Low-magnitude, high-frequency mechanical stimulation improves bone strength in the proximal femur and may be a possible nonpharmacologic treatment option for postmenopausal osteoporosis.
