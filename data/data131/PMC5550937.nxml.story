) fulfils this role for over a hundred microorganisms for which it hosts curated molecular sequence typing data, providing sequence and allelic profile definitions for multi-locus sequence typing (MLST) and single-gene typing approaches. In recent years, these have expanded to cover the whole genome with schemes such as core genome MLST (cgMLST) and whole genome MLST (wgMLST) which catalogue the allelic diversity found in hundreds to thousands of genes. These approaches provide a common nomenclature for high-resolution strain characterization and comparison. Molecular typing information is linked to isolate provenance, phenotype, and increasingly genome assemblies, providing a resource for outbreak investigation and research in to population structure, gene association, global epidemiology and vaccine coverage. A Representational State Transfer (REST) Application Programming Interface (API) has been developed for the PubMLST website to make these large quantities of structured molecular typing and whole genome sequence data available for programmatic access by any third party application. The API is an integral component of the Bacterial Isolate Genome Sequence Database (BIGSdb) platform that is used to host PubMLST resources, and exposes all public data within the site. In addition to data browsing, searching and download, the API supports authentication and submission of new data to curator queues.
