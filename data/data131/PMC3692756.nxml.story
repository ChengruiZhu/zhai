A syndromic surveillance project (ISSC) has been implemented in rural Jiangxi Province of China since August 2011. Doctors in the healthcare surveillance units of ISSC used an internet-based electronic system to collect information of daily outpatients, which included 10 infectious related symptoms. From ISSC database, we extracted data of fever patients reported from one township hospital in GZ town between August 1st and December 31st, 2011 to conduct an exploratory study. Six different control bar algorithms, which included Shewart, Moving Average (MA), Exponentially Weighted Moving Average (EWMA) and EARS’ C1, C2, C3, were prospectively run among historical time series of daily fever count to simulate a real-time outbreak detection. Each control bar used 7 days’ moving baseline with a lag of 2 days [the baseline for predicting Day(t) starts from Day(t-9) to Day(t-3), C1 method used a lag of zero day]. We set the threshold of μ+2σ for Shewart and MA, and 2.1 for EWMA C1, C2 and C3. An alarm was triggered when the observed data exceeded threshold, and the detailed information of each patient were checked for signal verification. Microsoft Excel 2007 was used to calculate the simulation results.
