Developmental biology is entering the digital age, thanks to advancements in imaging technologies, instrumentation, and software. These advancements are converging with discoveries in developmental biology to deliver unprecedented insight into how human development is impacted by the products we use, the environment we live in, and our genetic composition. Industrial societies are becoming increasingly concerned with the exposure of women and their unborn fetuses to pharmaceuticals and commonplace household chemicals. In addition, understanding genetic causes of birth defects is now possible through the isolation of specific genes, which can be efficiently disrupted in embryos, and subsequently observed for birth defects. Such studies of embryotoxicity typically involve the use of mouse embryos. However, evaluation of mouse embryos in the past has involved expensive and cumbersome external inspection and thin sectioning for view under the microscope. As such, developmental biologists have eagerly anticipated the advent of tools that would allow them to routinely assess the complex and dynamic organization of embryos using techniques that are fast and inexpensive. In this article, the authors introduce a rapid, high-quality, and inexpensive technique for the three-dimensional visualization of mouse embryos using X-ray computed tomography that is ideally suited for researchers in pharmaceutical, industrial, and academic laboratories.
