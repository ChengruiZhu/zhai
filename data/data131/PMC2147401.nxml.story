., that concentration just sufficient to cause doubling of the catalase activity of the yeast suspension) was independent of the concentration of the yeast cells. 5. Viability studies show that the number of yeast cells killed by the altering agents was not related to the degree of activation of the catalase produced. While all the cells were invariably killed by concentrations of altering agent which produced complete activation, all the cells had been killed by concentrations which were insufficient to cause more than 50 per cent maximal activation. Further, the evidence suggested that the catalase may be partially activated by concentrations of altering agent which cause no decrease in viability at all. Hence alteration, unlike death, may not be all-or-none per cell. 6. The fact that the biological criterion being examined was the activation of a water-soluble enzyme rules out the possibility that the reason for the logarithmic increase in altering activity with chain length was increase in concentration of the altering agent in some intracellular fat phase. It is concluded that these surface-active agents cause enzyme alteration by becoming adsorbed at some intracellular interface and thus causing, directly or indirectly, the modification of catalase properties. 7. It is considered that these data support, but do not provide critical proof for, the interfacial hypothesis, which states that catalase is present at the intracellular interface in question, but is desorbed into solution as a consequence of the alteration process.
