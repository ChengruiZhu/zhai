The aim of the present study was to analyze the effect of operating room (OR) care combined with home care on postoperative rehabilitation and prognosis of gastric cancer patients with low PTEN gene expression. Ninety-six gastric cancer patients with low PTEN gene expression, who underwent surgical treatment in our hospital were recruited. PTEN expression was measured by semi-quantitative polymerase chain reaction. Participants were randomized into the observation and control groups, with 48 cases each. Participants in the two groups received the same preoperative examination, gastric cancer surgery, postoperative drug therapy, and general care, while observation group participants were provided more comprehensive OR care combined with home care. After 1 year of home care, the self-rating anxiety scale (SAS) and Hamilton anxiety scale (HAMA) scores, rehabilitation status, overall quality of life, and Family Adaptability and Cohesion Scale were applied to compare postoperative rehabilitation and prognosis status in both groups. Data were statistically analyzed. Patients were followed up for 3 years, and survival time was analyzed. The operative time and bleeding volume between the two groups were not significantly different (p>0.05). The time of extubation and postoperative recovery time in the observation group were shorter than in the control group (p<0.01). The postoperative SAS and HAMA scores in both groups were significantly decreased compared with those preoperatively (p<0.01). Additionally, these scores were significantly lower in the observation than in the control group (p<0.01). The rehabilitation status of body function in the observation group was better than in the control group (p<0.01). Regarding the overall quality of life score and family adaptability and cohesion score, the observation group was better than the control group (p<0.01). In conclusion, OR care combined with home care was effective for the care of gastric cancer patients with low PTEN expression. Improving patient mood and mental state played a positive role in postoperative rehabilitation and prognosis.
