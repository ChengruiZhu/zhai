Blood count parameters of patients referring with erectile dysfunction (ED) were examined in this study and it was investigated whether eosinophil count (EC), platelet count (PC), and mean platelet volume values among the suspected predictive parameters which may play a role in especially penile arteriogenic ED etiopathogenesis had a contribution on pathogenesis. Patients referring with ED complaint were evaluated. Depending on the medical story, ED degree was determined by measuring International Index of Erectile Function. Penile Doppler ultrasonography was taken in patients suspected to have vasculogenic ED. According to penile Doppler ultrasonography result, patients with arterial deficiency were included in the penile arteriogenic ED group and the patients with normal results were included in the nonvasculogenic ED group. A total of 36 patients participated in the study from the penile arteriogenic ED group and 32 patients from the nonvasculogenic ED group. Compared with the nonvasculogenic ED group, the penile arteriogenic ED groupâ€™s low International Index of Erectile Function score, high EC, mean platelet volume and PC values were detected to be statistically significant (
