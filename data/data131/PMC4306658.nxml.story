The twin character of reactive oxygen species is substantiated by a growing body of evidence that reactive oxygen species within cells act as inducers and accelerators of the oncogenic phenotype of cancer cells, while reactive oxygen species can also induce cancer cell death and can therefore function as anti-tumorigenic species. The aim of this study was to assess a possible influence of xanthine/xanthine oxidase on the proliferation of colorectal cancer cell line Caco-2. xanthine/xanthine oxidase (2.5 µM/0.25 mU/ml–25 µM/2.5 mU/ml) dose-dependently inhibited the proliferation of Caco-2 cells. Experiments utilizing reactive oxygen species scavengers (superoxide dismutase, catalase and mannitol) and exogenous hydrogen peroxide revealed a major role of hydrogen peroxide in the xanthine/xanthine oxidase effect. Investigations utilizing annexin V-fluorescein/PI assay using flow cytometry, and the lactate dehydrogenase extracellular release assay indicated that hydrogen peroxide induced necrosis, but not apoptosis, in Caco-2 cells. These results suggest that hydrogen peroxide generated by xanthine/xanthine oxidase has the potential to suppress colorectal cancer cell proliferation.
