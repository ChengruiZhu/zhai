A NIR method was developed for the on-line monitoring of alkali-free cloth/phenolic resin prepreg during its manufacturing process. First, the sizing content of the alkali-free cloth was analyzed, and then the resin, soluble resin and volatiles content of the prepreg was analyzed simultaneously using the FT-NIR spectrometer. Partial least square (PLS) regression was used to develop the calibration models, which for the sizing content was preprocessed by 1stDER +MSC, for the volatile content by 1stDER +VN, for the soluble resin content by 1stDER +MSC and for the resin content by the VN spectral data preprocessing method. RMSEP of the prediction model for the sizing content was 0.732 %, for the resin content it was 0.605, for the soluble resin content it was 0.101 and for volatiles content it was 0.127. The results of the paired t-test revealed that there was no significant difference between the NIR method and the standard method. The NIR spectroscopy method could be used to predict the resin, soluble resin and the volatiles content of the prepreg simultaneously, as well as sizing content of alkali-free cloth. The processing parameters of the prepreg during manufacture could be adjusted quickly with the help of the NIR analysis results. The results indicated that the NIR spectroscopy method was sufficiently accurate and effective for the on-line monitoring of alkali-free cloth/phenolic resin prepreg.
