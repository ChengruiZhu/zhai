A cohort study was conducted to investigate the association between vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) polymorphisms −2578C/A, −1154G/A and −634C/G and the clinical outcome of renal cell carcinoma (RCC), as well as the interaction of VEGF polymorphisms with tumor stage, metastasis and size. A total of 310 RCC patients were recruited from the First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University (Zhengzhou, China) between January 2006 and December 2007, and were followed up until December 2012. The association between the three single nucleotide polymorphisms and the overall survival of RCC patients was estimated using Cox’s proportional hazard regression model. The median follow-up duration was 34.7 months and 74 of the RCC patients succumbed due to cancer during the follow-up period. The frequency of the VEGF −2578 AA genotype was significantly higher in patients classed as tumor stages III–IV (odds ratio [OR], 0.47; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.24–0.95) and larger tumors (longest diameter, >4 cm; OR, 0.44; 95% CI, 0.22–0.89). Furthermore, the frequency of VEGF −634 GG was significantly higher in patients with larger tumors (longest diameter, >4 cm; OR, 0.68; 95% CI, 0.48–0.97). The VEGF −2578 AA genotype was correlated with a 2.96-fold increase in the risk of RCC-associated mortality and was associated with a five-year survival rate of ~25%. Therefore, the present study identified that the VEGF −2578C/A polymorphism may be associated with the prognosis of RCC patients, and may interact with the tumor stage and size.
