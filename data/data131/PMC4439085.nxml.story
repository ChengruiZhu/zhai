The formation of haploid gametes (sex cells, such as eggs and sperm) from diploid precursor cells involves two nuclear divisions but one round of chromosomal replication. In the unique first meiotic division, centromeres of sister chromatids remain connected and homologous chromosomes (homologs) segregate from each other. In most species proper homolog segregation requires that crossover recombination occur between homologs to impart tension between homologs as they move apart. A protein kinase (casein kinase 1) has long been known to regulate proper sister centromere connections by phosphorylating Rec8, a meiosis-specific sister chromatid cohesin subunit. We report here that in fission yeast this kinase has a second critical roleâ€”to mediate phosphorylation of another meiosis-specific cohesin subunit Rec11. Phosphorylation of Rec11 enhances loading of two meiosis-specific components of linear elements, which are related to the synaptonemal complex and help pair homologs. These linear element proteins lead to high-level DNA breakage and crossovers between homologs. Thus, casein kinase regulates two crucial but separate events in meiosis. The mammalian functional homolog of Rec11, called STAG3, is also phosphorylated during meiosis and appears to be required for fertility in human females. These observations suggest wide-spread conservation of the roles of casein kinase 1 and Rec11 in ensuring proper meiotic chromosome segregation and sexual reproduction.
