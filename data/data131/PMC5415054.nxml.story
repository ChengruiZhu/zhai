Type 3e and 5 27 cases (18 patients, average 22y) torsional osteotomies were performed. 21 of 27 cases were classified as type 3e (7%), 6 as type 5 (2%). 22 other cases (19 patients) with an average age of 27 years (14-46 years) were classified as type 3d (7,5% of all cases). 17 axial adjustments were performed, 4 isolated MPFL reconstructions and 1 osteotomy of the tibial tubercle. Average femoral antetorsion was 38,6° (±9,3°), die tibial torsion was 35,1° (±11,7°). The average deviation of the leg axis in the frontal plane was 5° (±2,4°) varus (n=9) and 2,8° (±2,9°) valgus (n=14). The mean TT-TG distance was 19,9 mm (±4,9 mm). Torsional osteotomy was combined with MPFL-reconstruction (n=19), tibial tubercle transfer (Ø12,6 mm, n=13) or axial correction (Ø4° varus, Ø6° valgus, n=13), 5 double osteotomies. Torsion was corrected by 13° femoral and 11° tibial on average. After 19 months VAS was 1.2, Kujala 78.8, a Lysholm 79.1, Tegner 4. Only one patient experienced a subluxation after a fall. No redislocation. 3d 7,5% (n=22) showed a mean axial deviation of 6,5° (±2,2°) valgus. Average TT-TG distance was 18,3 mm (±5,8 mm). We performed 15 closed-wedge varus distal femoral osteotomies (Ø6,8°±2,3°), combined with an Elmslie-Trillat (n=14) or Fulkerson procedure (n=1), MPFL reconstruction (n=15) or lateral release (n=1). 4 isolated MPFL reconstructions. One case of a pathological lateral slope with patellar instability was treated by double osteotomy (8° femoral to varus, 4° tibial to valgus). One tibial varisation (5,5°) with MPFL reconstruction and Elmslie-Trillat procedure. Tibial tubercle was medialized by 11 mm ±6,7 mm on average. 22 MPFL reconstructions were done. After average 33 months VAS was 2.3, Kujala 72, Lysholm 79, Tegner 4. No redislocation.
