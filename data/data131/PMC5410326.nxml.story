Viral infection activates a host's cellular phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt signaling pathway, which is involved in cell differentiation, growth, survival, and apoptosis. To elucidate molecular mechanisms in the pathogenesis of Newcastle disease virus (NDV), we demonstrated that NDV transiently activates the PI3K/Akt pathway in chicken cells at an early phase of infection. Its activation was observed as early as 15 min post-infection and gradually weakened after 24 h. Incubating cells with a PI3K inhibitor, LY294002 or wortmannin, prior to NDV infection decreased NDV progeny yields and suppressed Akt phosphorylation at early times post-infection. Akt activation is triggered by NDV-GM or NDV-F48E9 and is abolished by methyl Î²-cyclodextrin and chlorpromazine. Treatment following NDV-La Sota infection had no obvious effect. However, inhibiting PI3K activation promoted apoptotic responses during an early stage of NDV infection. The pan caspase inhibitor ZVAD-FMK mitigated the reduction in Akt phosphorylation by inhibiting PI3K activation, which indicates the signaling pathway promotes cell survival and, in turn, facilitates viral replication. By suppressing premature apoptosis upon NDV infection, the PI3K/Akt pathway enhances the anti-apoptotic response.
