Antibodies binding to the surface of virions can lead to virus neutralisation. Different theories have been proposed to determine the number of antibodies that must bind to a virion for neutralisation. Early models are based on chemical binding kinetics. Applying these models lead to very low estimates of the number of antibodies needed for neutralisation. In contrast, according to the more conceptual approach of stoichiometries in virology a much higher number of antibodies is required for virus neutralisation by antibodies. Here, we combine chemical binding kinetics with (virological) stoichiometries to better explain virus neutralisation by antibody binding. This framework is in agreement with published data on the neutralisation of the human immunodeficiency virus. Knowing antibody reaction constants, our model allows us to estimate stoichiometrical parameters from kinetic neutralisation curves. In addition, we can identify important parameters that will make further analysis of kinetic neutralisation curves more valuable in the context of estimating stoichiometries. Our model gives a more subtle explanation of kinetic neutralisation curves in terms of single-hit and multi-hit kinetics.
