Leptin, a hormone derived from adipose tissue, promotes growth of cancer cells via multiple mechanisms. Estrogen receptor signaling is also known to stimulate the growth of breast cancer cells. However, the involvement of estrogen receptor signaling in the oncogenic actions of leptin and its underlying mechanisms are not clearly understood. Herein, we investigated mechanisms for estrogen receptor signaling-mediated growth of breast cancer cells, particularly focusing on autophagy, which plays a crucial role in leptin-induced tumor growth. Inhibition of estrogen receptor signaling via gene silencing or treatment with a pharmacological inhibitor (tamoxifen) abolished leptin-induced growth of MCF-7 human breast cancer cells. Interestingly, leptin-induced autophagy activation, determined by up-regulation of autophagy-related genes and autophagosome formation, was also significantly suppressed by inhibiting estrogen receptor signaling. Moreover, inhibition of estrogen receptor markedly prevented leptin-induced activation of AMPK/FoxO3A axis, which plays a crucial role in autophagy induction. Leptin-induced cell cycle progression and Bax down-regulation were also prevented by treatment with tamoxifen. The pivotal roles of estrogen receptor signaling in leptin-induced cell cycle progression, apoptosis suppression, and autophagy induction were further confirmed in MCF-7 tumor xenograft model. Taken together, these results demonstrate that estrogen receptor signaling plays a key role in leptin-induced growth of breast cancer cells via autophagy activation.
