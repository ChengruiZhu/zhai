In this paper the stimuli for and pattern of Schwann cell proliferation are defined under various experimental conditions. We used a tissue culture system in which fetal rat dorsal root ganglia, treated to eliminate contaminating fibroblasts (Wood, P., 1976, Brain Res. 115:361- -375), appear to recapitulate many aspects of the developing peripheral nervous system. We observed that: (a) proliferation of Schwann cells on neurites is initially rapid, but, as each neurite becomes fully ensheathed, division slows considerably and is confined to the periphery of the outgrowth; (b) during the period of rapid proliferation, excision of the ganglion causes a rapid decay in the number of dividing cells; (c) excision of the ganglion from more established cultures in which there was little ongoing proliferation resulted in a small increase in labeling at the site of excision for all Schwann cells and a substantial increase in labeling for myelin- related cells with a peak labeling period at 4 d; (d) direct mechanical injury during Wallerian degeneration is mitogenic for Schwann cells; (e) a variety of potential mitogens failed to stimulate Schwann cell proliferation, and (f) replated cells have a slightly higher level of proliferation and show a small and variable response to the addition of cAMP.
