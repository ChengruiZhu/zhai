Currently there are limited treatment options for corneal blindness caused by dysfunctional corneal endothelial cells. The primary treatment involves transplantation of healthy donor human corneal endothelial cells, but a global shortage of donor corneas necessitates other options. Conventional tissue approaches for corneal endothelial cells are based on EDTA-trypsin treatment and run the risk of irreversible endothelial mesenchymal transition by activating canonical Wingless-related integration site (Wnt) and TGF-β signaling. Herein, we demonstrate an alternative strategy that avoids disruption of cell–cell junctions and instead activates Ras homologue gene family A (RhoA)–Rho-associated protein kinase (ROCK)–canonical bone morphogenic protein signaling to reprogram adult human corneal endothelial cells to neural crest–like progenitors via activation of the miR302b-Oct4-Sox2-Nanog network. This approach allowed us to engineer eight human corneal endothelial monolayers of transplantable size, with a normal density and phenotype from one corneoscleral rim. Given that a similar signal network also exists in the retinal pigment epithelium, this partial reprogramming approach may have widespread relevance and potential for treating degenerative diseases.
