A total of 773 children 6–59 months with fever in the last two weeks were included in the study. In iCCM served areas, APEs were the predominant source of care and treatment; 87.1% (95% confidence interval CI 80.8–93.4) of children 6–59 months with fever who sought care were taken first to an APE and APEs accounted for 86.2% (95% CI 79.7–92.7) of all first–line antimalarial treatments. Public health facilities were the leading source of care in comparison areas, providing care to 86.1% (95% CI 79.0–93.3) of children with fever taken for care outside the home. Timeliness of treatment was significantly better in intervention areas, where 63.9% (95% CI 54.4–73.3) of children received treatment within 24 hours of symptom onset compared to 37.5% (95% CI 31.1–43.9) in comparison areas. Children taken first to an APE were more likely to receive a rapid diagnostic test (RDT) (68.1%; 95% CI 57.2–79.0) and to have their respiratory rate assessed (60.0%; 95% CI 45.4–74.6) compared to children taken to health facilities (41.4%; 95% CI33.7–49.2 and 19.4%; 95% CI 8.4–30.5, respectively). Overall, 61.3% (95% CI 51.5–71.0) of children with fever receiving care from APEs received the correct drug within 24 hours and for the correct duration compared to 26.0% (95% CI 18.2–33.9) of those receiving care from health facilities.
