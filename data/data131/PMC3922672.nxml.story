The occurrence of neutrophils at the pannus-cartilage border is an important phenomenon for understanding the pathogenesis of rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) are predominant enzymes responsible for the cartilage degradation. The present article studied the expression of CD147 on neutrophils and its potential role in neutrophil chemotaxis, MMPs production and the invasiveness of fibroblast-like synoviocytes (FLS). The results of flow cytometry revealed that the mean fluorescence intensity of CD147 expression on neutrophils of peripheral blood from RA patients was higher than that in healthy individual. The potential role of CD147 in cyclophilin A (CyPA)-mediated cell migration was studied using chemotaxis assay and it was found that the addition of anti-CD147 antibody significantly decreased the chemotactic index of the neutrophils. Significantly elevated release and activation of MMPs were seen in the co-culture of neutrophil and FLS compared with cultures of the cells alone. An increased number of cells invading through the filters in the invasion assays were also observed in the co-cultured cells. The addition of anti-CD147 antibody had some inhibitory effect, not only on MMP production but also on cell invasion in the co-culture model. Our study demonstrates that the increased expression of CD147 on neutrophils in RA may be responsible for CyPA-mediated neutrophil migration into the joints, elevated MMPs secretion and cell invasion of synoviocytes, all of which may contribute to the cartilage invasion and bone destruction of RA. Better knowledge of these findings will hopefully provide a new insight into the pathogenesis of RA.
