 and is a major causative agent of epidemics of hand, foot and mouth disease associated with severe neurological disease. Three EV71 genogroups, designated A, B and C, have been identified, with 75–84 % nucleotide sequence similarity between them. Two strains, EV71-26M (genogroup B) and EV71-6F (genogroup C), were found to have distinct cell-culture growth (26M, rapid; 6F, slow) and plaque-formation (26M, large; 6F, small) phenotypes. To identify the genome regions responsible for the growth phenotypes of the two strains, a series of chimeric viruses was constructed by exchanging the 5′ untranslated region (UTR), P1 structural protein or P2/P3 non-structural protein gene regions plus the 3′UTR using infectious cDNA clones of both virus strains. Analysis of reciprocal virus chimeras revealed that the 5′UTRs of both strains were compatible, but not responsible for the observed phenotypes. Introduction of the EV71-6F P1 region into the EV71-26M clone resulted in a small-plaque and slow-growth phenotype similar to that of EV71-6F, whereas the reciprocal chimera displayed intermediate-growth and intermediate-sized plaque phenotypes. Introduction of the EV71-26M P2–P3–3′UTR regions into the EV71-6F clone resulted in a large-plaque and rapid-growth phenotype identical to that of strain EV71-26M, whereas the reciprocal chimera retained the background strain large-plaque phenotype. These results indicate that, although both the P1 and P2–P3–3′UTR genome regions influence the EV71 growth phenotype in cell culture, phenotype expression is dependent on specific genome-segment combinations and is not reciprocal.
