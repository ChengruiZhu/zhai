Many natural and engineered networks contain recurring patterns of local connectivity. Although these so-called network motifs are thought to have functional significance, direct tests of the idea that network topology reflects function remain scarce. We have performed such a test in the area of mammalian neocortex that is devoted to the sensory representation of touch. To this end, we equipped inhibitory interneurons in the mouse with light-activated ion channels that allowed us to stimulate interneuron activity optically and record light-evoked inhibitory currents in their postsynaptic partners, thereby revealing maps of connectivity. We find that excitatory pyramidal cells in layer 2/3 of primary somatosensory cortex receive inhibition from GABAergic interneurons located in different cortical layers, with a characteristic balance of inhibitory connections from deep and superficial layers. Trimming the whiskers to remove sensory input in adult animals alters this balanceâ€”inhibitory connections from deep cortical layers are depleted, while inhibitory connections from superficial layers are augmented. These changes revert when the whiskers regrow, restoring the original balance between wiring motifs. This see-saw relationship between deep and superficial inhibition demonstrates that mature cortical circuits adapt to functional change by selectively altering specific network motifs.
