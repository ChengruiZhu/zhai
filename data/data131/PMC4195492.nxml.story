With a remarkable increase in genomic sequence data of a wide range of species, novel tools are needed for comprehensive analyses of the big sequence data. Self-organizing map (SOM) is a powerful tool for clustering high-dimensional data on one plane. For oligonucleotide compositions handled as high-dimensional data, we have previously modified the conventional SOM for genome informatics: BLSOM. In the present study, we constructed BLSOMs for oligonucleotide compositions in fragment sequences (e.g. 100 kb) from a wide range of vertebrates, including coelacanth, and found that the sequences were clustered primarily according to species without species information. As one of the nearest living relatives of tetrapod ancestors, coelacanth is believed to provide access to the phenotypic and genomic transitions leading to the emergence of tetrapods. The characteristic oligonucleotide composition found for coelacanth was connected with the lowest dinucleotide CG occurrence (i.e. the highest CG suppression) among fishes, which was rather equivalent to that of tetrapods. This evident CG suppression in coelacanth should reflect molecular evolutionary processes of epigenetic systems including DNA methylation during vertebrate evolution. Sequence of a
