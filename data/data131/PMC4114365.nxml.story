Treatment of complicated acute appendicitis is controversial. The dilemma is further complicated by presence of free fecalith in a well-circumscribed abscess, which has been repeatedly demonstrated to be a major predicting factor of treatment failure of nonoperative treatment of acute appendicitis complicated with appendiceal abscess. If left behind after drainage of the abscess, further operations for removal of retained fecalith or recurrence of abscess might be required. However, little had been stressed over the significance of removal of the free fecalith when it was first encountered. We report our experience of drainage of appendiceal abscess and removal of free fecalith by taking an extraperitoneal approach. Both of our cases made a smooth recovery without any complication or recurrence after a 2-year follow-up. Treatment with this approach avoids many of the complications associated with formal laparotomy. Unlike image-guided drainage or laparoscopic drainage, this procedure is relatively simple and straightforward and can be performed in any level of hospital, including private practitioners and in less well-developed areas and countries. With proper case selection, we recommend this approach as one of the alternatives in the treatment of late-presenting appendiceal abscess with free fecalith.
