without enzymatic digestion for more than one year and revealed the continuous outgrowth of adherent and proliferating primary cell populations. Immunofluorescence staining of these human breast cancer-derived epithelial cells (HBCEC) and quantification by flow cytometry revealed nearly exclusively cytokeratin-expressing cells. Analysis of surface markers during long term tumor culture of primary HBCEC (more than 476d) demonstrated a prominent expression of CD24, CD44 and MUC1 (CD227). According to aging markers, expression of senescence-associated Î²-galactosidase revealed little if any positive staining in a primary tumor-derived HBCEC population after 722d in culture, whereas the majority of normal human mammary epithelial cells (HMEC) demonstrated senescent cells already after a culture period of 32d. In this context, HBCEC populations derived from a tumor culture after 152d and 308d, respectively, exhibited a significant telomerase activity, suggesting continuous proliferative capacity. Treatment with several chemotherapeutic compounds and their combinations revealed distinct cytotoxic effects among HBCEC from different breast cancer patients, indicating an individualized response of these tumor-derived primary cells.
