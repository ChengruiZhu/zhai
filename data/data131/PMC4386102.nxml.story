Marked improvements in survival and health outcome for people infected with HIV have occurred since the advent of combination antiretroviral therapy over a decade ago. Yet HIV-associated neurocognitive disorders continue to occur with an alarming prevalence. This may reflect the fact that infected people are now living longer with chronic infection. There is mounting evidence that HIV exacerbates age-associated cognitive decline. Many middle-aged HIV-infected people are experiencing cognitive decline similar that to that found among much older adults. An increased prevalence of vascular and metabolic comorbidities has also been observed and is greatest among older adults with HIV. Premature age-associated neurocognitive decline appears to be related to structural and functional brain changes on neuroimaging, and of particular concern is the fact that pathology indicative of neurodegenerative disease has been shown to occur in the brains of HIV-infected people. Yet notable differences also exist between the clinical presentation and brain disturbances occurring with HIV and those occurring in neurodegenerative conditions such as Alzheimerâ€™s disease. HIV interacts with the aging brain to affect neurological structure and function. However, whether this interaction directly affects neurodegenerative processes, accelerates normal cognitive aging, or contributes to a worsening of other comorbidities that affect the brain in older adults remains an open question. Evidence for and against each of these possibilities is reviewed.
