137 bipolar patients met the inclusion criteria (depressive episode: DSM-IV-TR criteria for major depressive episode, HAMD score ≥17; manic/hypomanic episode: DSM-IV-TR criteria for manic/hypomanic episode, YMRS score ≥12, euthymic: 6 months of remission, HAMD score ≤8, YMRS score ≤6; and mixed: DSM-IV-TR criteria for mixed episode, HAMD score >8 and YMRS score >6) and were therefore enrolled in the study. Patients were free of psychotic symptoms (hallucinations/delusions) at the moment of testing. Control group consisted of 62 healthy subjects without history of neurological and/or psychiatric disorder. Cognitive battery has been applied in order to assess verbal memory, working memory, psychomotor speed, verbal fluency, attention and speed of information processing, and executive function. Following data were collected: demographics, psychiatric history, age of illness onset; current and previous treatment (including hospitalizations). Cognitive deficits were assessed in bipolar patients experiencing manic, depressive, mixed episodes or who were euthymic in mood. Results were compared between the subgroups and with healthy individuals. The association of impaired cognition with illness course was analyzed.
