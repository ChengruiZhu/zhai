Aberrant expression of long noncoding RNA GAS5 in bladder cancer (BC) cells was identified in recent studies. However, the regulatory functions and underlying molecular mechanisms of GAS5 in BC development remain unclear. Here, we confirmed that there was a negative correlation between GAS5 level and bladder tumor clinical stage. Functionally, overexpression of GAS5 reduced cell viability and induced cell apoptosis in T24 and EJ bladder cancer cells. Mechanistically, GAS5 effectively repressed EZH2 transcription by directly interacting with E2F4 and recruiting E2F4 to EZH2 promoter. We previously reported that miR-101 induced the apoptosis of BC cells by inhibiting the expression of EZH2. Interestingly, the present study showed that downregulation of EZH2 by GAS5 resulted in overexpression of miR-101 in T24 and EJ cells. Furthermore, the level of GAS5 was increased under the treatment of Gambogic acid (GA), a promising natural anti-cancer compound, whereas knockdown of GAS5 suppressed the inhibitory effect of GA on cell viability and abolished GA-induced apoptosis in T24 and EJ cells. Taken together, our findings demonstrated a tumor-suppressor role of GAS5 by inhibiting EZH2 on transcriptional level, and additionally provided a novel therapeutic strategy for treating human bladder cancer.
