We report a relatively uncommon case of a 39-year-old Chinese woman with local advanced breast cancer (LABC) treated with 6 cycles of docetaxel, doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide (TAC) regimen neoadjuvant chemotherapy, and subsequently mastectomy, intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) and tamoxifen followed as regularly. Brain metastatic event appeared in 6 months after mastectomy. Treatment for brain metastasis was surgical resection and followed by whole brain radiotherapy (WBRT) approved by multidisciplinary team (MDT). Initial pathological diagnosis was IDC, cT4N1M0, luminal B (ER+ 90%, PR+90%, HER2 0, Ki67+ 70%) based on ultrasound-guided core needle biopsy. Surgical pathology revealed IDC, pT2N3M0 luminal B (ER+ 20%, PR+20%, HER2 0, Ki67+ 20%). Histological response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy is grade 3 according to the Miller/Payne grading system. Final pathology of brain metastasis showed a HER2 overexpression metastatic breast cancer luminal B (ER+ 70%, PR+ 70%, HER2 2+, Ki67+ 30%), FISH confirmed HER2 overexpression. Weekly paclitaxel plus trastuzumab was given for 12 weeks, then trastuzumab every 3 weeks for a whole year. Patient follow-up is still ongoing, no new events appear yet.
