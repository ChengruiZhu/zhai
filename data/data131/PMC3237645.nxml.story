 mouse–derived isolated hepatocytes were used as ER stress models. A tyrosine phosphatase inhibitor, a deacetylation inhibitor, and an acetylated mutant of STAT3 were used to examine the effect of ER stress on hepatic STAT3 action. ER stress inhibited STAT3-dependent suppression of gluconeogenic enzyme gene expression by suppressing hepatic Janus kinase (JAK)2 and STAT3 phosphorylation. A tyrosine phosphatase inhibitor restored ER stress–induced suppression of JAK2 phosphorylation but exhibited no improving effect on suppressed STAT3 phosphorylation. STAT3 acetylation is known to correlate with its phosphorylation. ER stress also decreased STAT3 acetylation. An acetylated mutant of STAT3 was resistant to ER stress–induced inhibition of STAT3-phosphorylation and STAT3-dependent suppression of hepatic gluconeogenic enzyme gene expression in vitro and in vivo. Trichostatin A, a histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor, ameliorated ER stress–induced inhibition of STAT3 acetylation and phosphorylation. The current study revealed that ER stress inhibits STAT3-dependent suppression of hepatic gluconeogenic enzymes via JAK2 dephosphorylation and HDAC-dependent STAT3 deacetylation, playing an important role in the increase of hepatic glucose production in obesity and diabetes.
