Many cellular behaviors including growth, differentiation, and movement are influenced by external stimuli. Such external stimuli are obtained, processed, and carried to the nucleus by the signaling networkâ€”a dense network of cellular biochemical reactions. Beyond being interesting for their role in directing cellular behavior, deleterious changes in a cell's signaling network can alter a cell's responses to external stimuli, giving rise to devastating diseases such as cancer. As a result, building accurate mathematical and computational models of cellular signaling networks is a major endeavor in biology. The scale and complexity of these networks render them difficult to analyze by experimental techniques alone, which has led to the development of computational analysis methods. In this paper, we present a novel computational simulation technique that can provide qualitatively accurate predictions of the behavior of a cellular signaling network without requiring detailed knowledge of the signaling network's parameters. Our approach makes use of recent discoveries that network structure alone can determine many aspects of a network's dynamics. When compared against experimental results, our method correctly predicted 90% of the cases considered. In those where it did not agree, our approach provided valuable insights into discrepancies between known network structure and experimental observations.
