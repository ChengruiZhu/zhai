(1) The objective of this study was to assess the risk perceptions, attitudes, knowledge, and behaviors related to typhoon among rural residents in Zhejiang province of China. A cross-sectional study was conducted among rural residents in Zhejiang province, China. Information was collected from 659 participants using a structured questionnaire. Univariate analysis and multivariable analysis were used to analyze the data. Participants were most concerned about property damage, followed by their health and life. Television, short message service (SMS), relatives and friends were the most common information sources. Most people had not been educated with disaster prevention measures. The complementary log–log (CLL) model showed that understanding typhoon warning signal, preparation time, risk perception of health damage and life threat, and fears of typhoon were independent predictors of adoption of coping behaviors. We found that: 1. Residents’ risk perception of health and life threat caused by typhoon is inadequate; 2. There is a gap between residents’ cognition or knowledge and behavior in rural areas; 3. The government should further make strategies to develop educational activities, in order to eliminate the gap and improve the ability of preparing for typhoon among rural residents.
