Kynurenines, the tryptophan metabolites with multiple biological activities, regulate the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) during several neurodegenerative diseases. Many experiments show that kynurenines can be both prooxidants and antioxidants depending on their concentration, mode of action, and cell redox potential. However, there is lack of computational studies of kynurenines properties which could help us better understand the biophysical mechanism of their antioxidant activity. We performed the computations of kynurenines' hydrogen and electron donating power, both in the gas phase and in water solution. We found that aromatic hydroxyl group facilitates hydrogen and electron abstraction by kynurenines, in agreement with experimental data and computations earlier performed for phenolic antioxidants. We revealed the correlations of kynurenines' antioxidant power with their electronic structure, charge, and surroundings. We also found that 3-hydroxykynurenine and 3-hydroxyanthranilic acid can fastly quench free radicals by hydrogen atom donation. Hence both of them are potent antioxidants. The therapeutic strategy may be to inhibit their oxidative dimerization leading to ROS production.
