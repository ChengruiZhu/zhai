The initiation of replication is an extremely important process in DNA life cycle. Given an uncharacterized DNA sequence, can we identify where its origin of replication (ORI) is located? It is no doubt a fundamental problem in genome analysis. Particularly, with the rapid development of genome sequencing technology that results in a huge amount of sequence data, it is highly desired to develop computational methods for rapidly and effectively identifying the ORIs in these genomes. Unfortunately, by means of the existing computational methods, such as sequence alignment or kmer strategies, it could hardly achieve decent success rates. To address this problem, we developed a predictor called “iOri-Human”. Rigorous jackknife tests have shown that its overall accuracy and stability in identifying human ORIs are over 75% and 50%, respectively. In the predictor, it is through the pseudo nucleotide composition (an extension of pseudo amino acid composition) that 96 physicochemical properties for the 16 possible constituent dinucleotides have been incorporated to reflect the global sequence patterns in DNA as well as its local sequence patterns. Moreover, a user-friendly web-server for iOri-Human has been established at
