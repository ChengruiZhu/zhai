The purpose of the present study was to examine whether aspirin interferes with the inflammatory response in a thrombus-stimulated lung microvascular endothelial cell (LMVEC) model. The LMVECs were randomly divided into eight groups: Normal group (group N), model group (group M), model + ASP group (group M+A), model+CX3CL1-short hairpin (sh)RNA group (group M+SH), model + CX3CL1-overexpression vector group (group M+CX3), model + ASP + shRNA group (group M+A+SH), model + ASP + CX3CL1-overexpression vector group (group M+A+CX3), and normal + virus control group (group N+V). The endothelial cells were cultured, and a thrombus was added to the cells. Briefly, 12 h following the precipitation of the thrombus, data from ELISA, reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction analysis and confocal microscopy revealed that the levels of tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, interleukin (IL)-6, CX3C chemokine ligand 1 (CX3CL1), CX3C chemokine receptor 1 (CX3CR1) and nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) in group M were increased, compared with those in group N (P<0.01). These levels, with the exception of TNF-α, were significantly lower in group M+SH, compared with those in group M (P<0.01). Furthermore, the levels of IL-6 in groups M+A, M+CX3 and M+A+CX3 were decreased, compared with those in group M (P<0.01); the level of TNF-α in group M+A+SH was decreased, compared with that in group M (P<0.01); the level of CX3CR1 waslower in groups M+A and M+A+SH, compared with that in group M (P<0.01), and the level of NF-κB in group M+SH was decreased, compared with the level in group M and group M+A (P<0.05). In conclusion, the thrombus-stimulated LMVEC model exhibited induced production of TNF-α, IL-6, CX3CL, CX3CR1, NF-κB and intercellular adhesion molecule-1. Furthermore, it was confirmed that the signaling pathways involving CX3CL1-NF-κB, IL-6 and TNF-α were partly inhibited by aspirin.
