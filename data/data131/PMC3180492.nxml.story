A prospective pilot study evaluating the training module was undertaken in 13 ophthalmology trainees (residents and vitreoretinal fellows) with varying levels of vitreoretinal training experience. A vitreoretinal training module was designed and consisted of a three-port vitrectomy setup (sclerotomy wound construction, infusion placement), intraocular tasks (core vitrectomy, driving the operating microscope, membrane peel, airâ€“fluid exchange), and wound closure. Standard vitrectomy instrumentation, the VitRet eye (Phillips Studio, Bristol, UK) and vitreous-like fluid using dairy creamer and balanced saline were utilized. A five-point Likert scale, ie, the Casey Eye Institute Vitrectomy Indices Tool for Skills Assessment (CEIVITS), was devised to evaluate each component of the module. Vitreoretinal surgical maneuvers were digitally recorded and graded by an attending vitreoretinal surgeon. Linear regression and correlation were performed to evaluate the relationship between prior vitreoretinal experience and CEIVITS performance. The main outcome measures were correlation of vitreoretinal surgical experience and CEIVITS performance on simulated tasks using a basic vitreoretinal training module.
