As different hepatitis C virus (HCV) genotypes respond differently to initiated therapy, correct HCV genotyping is essential. A potential risk for misclassification of the intergenotypic HCV circulating recombinant form (CRF) 2k/1b strains exists, depending on the genotyping method used. The aim was to investigate the differences in HCV genotyping methods with regard to CRF 2k/1b and to gain insight in the prevalence of the CRF 2k/1b. Genotyping results by Versant HCV Genotype Assay were compared with nonstructural protein 5B (NS5B) sequencing. In total, from November 2001 until March 2015, 3296 serum samples were analyzed by Versant HCV Genotype Assay. As misclassified CRF is harbored among HCV genotype 2, we further focused our search on 142 (4.3%) samples positive for HCV genotype 2. On 116 (81.7%) retrieved samples, the NS5B sequencing was performed. Twelve out of the 116 retrieved samples (10.3%) were classified as CRF 2k/1b by sequencing of the NS5B region. Ten of these 12 samples were originally misclassified as genotype 2a or 2c, while 2 of them were misclassified as genotype 2. Our results show that the current prevalence of CRF 2k/1b is underestimated. The importance of correct HCV genotyping is emphasized, considering the tailored choice of treatment regimen and overall prognosis.
