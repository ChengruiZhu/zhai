In total, 375 persons received nPEP. The most common reason was needle stick (43%), followed by unprotected sexual intercourse (17%), rape (10%) and first aid (10%). In 84 (22%) cases, the source patient was either known to be HIV positive or within a high risk group (active injecting drug user). In total, 170 SAEs were reported, 139 persons had only one SAE and majority developed it within first two weeks. The most frequent first SAEs were gastrointestinal disorders (22%), followed by general symptoms (9%), hypersensitivity reactions (1.6%) and CNS symptoms (1.3%). The remaining events were laboratory abnormalities of liver and kidney function, haematological disorders, other and unknown, each contributing to less than 1% of all patients. 8 (2.1%) patients have developed a SUSAR (bradycardia, vivid dreams, lymphadenopathy of the neck, increased platelet count, swelling and pain of large joints, swelling of lower limbs, peripheral oedema and loss of concentration). 22 (5.9%) persons discontinued nPEP due to adverse event and 19 (5.1%) required a paid sick leave from work. In multivariate analyzes, only age was independent predictor of developing SAE (HR 1.17; [95% CI 1.03â€“1.34]; p=0.02).
