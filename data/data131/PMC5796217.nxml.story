Notch signaling as a conserved cell fate regulator is involved in the regulation of cell quiescence, proliferation, differentiation and postnatal tissue regeneration. However, how Notch signaling regulates porcine satellite cells (PSCs) has not been elucidated. We stably transfected Notch1 intracellular domain (N1ICD) into PSCs to analyze the gene expression profile and miRNA-seq. The analysis of the gene expression profile identified 295 differentially-expressed genes (DEGs) in proliferating-N1ICD PSCs (P-N1ICD) and nine DEGs on differentiating-N1ICD PSCs (D-N1ICD), compared with that in control groups (P-Control and D-Control, respectively). Analyzing the underlying function of DEGs showed that most of the upregulated DEGs enriched in P-N1ICD PSCs are related to the cell cycle. Forty-four and 12 known differentially-expressed miRNAs (DEMs) were identified in the P-N1ICD PSCs and D-N1ICD PSCs group, respectively. Furthermore, we constructed the gene-miRNA network of the DEGs and DEMs. In P-N1ICD PSCs, miR-125a, miR-125b, miR-10a-5p, ssc-miR-214, miR-423 and miR-149 are downregulated hub miRNAs, whose corresponding hub genes are marker of proliferation Ki-67 (MKI67) and nuclear receptor binding SET domain protein 2 (WHSC1). By contrast, miR-27a, miR-146a-5p and miR-221-3p are upregulated hub miRNAs, whose hub genes are RUNX1 translocation partner 1 (RUNX1T1) and fibroblast growth factor 2 (FGF2). All the hub miRNAs and genes are associated with cell proliferation. Quantitative RT-PCR results are consistent with the gene expression profile and miRNA-seq results. The results of our study provide valuable information for understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying Notch signaling in PSCs and skeletal muscle development.
