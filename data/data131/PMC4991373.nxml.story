Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is a leading cause of blindness worldwide affecting individuals over the age of 50. The neovascular form (NV AMD) is characterized by choroidal neovascularization (CNV) and responsible for the majority of central vision impairment. Using non-biased microRNA arrays and individual TaqMan qPCRs, we profiled miRNAs in the vitreous humour and plasma of patients with NV AMD. We identified a disease-associated increase in miR-146a and a decrease in miR-106b and miR-152 in the vitreous humour which was reproducible in plasma. Moreover, miR-146a/miR-106b ratios discriminated patients with NV AMD with an area under the Receiver Operating Characteristic curve (ROC AUC) of 0,977 in vitreous humour and 0,915 in plasma suggesting potential for a blood-based diagnostic. Furthermore, using the AMD Gene Consortium (AGC) we mapped a NV AMD-associated SNP (rs1063320) in a binding site for miR-152-3p in the HLA-G gene. The relationship between our detected miRNAs and NV AMD related genes was also investigated using gene sets derived from the Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA). To our knowledge, our study is the first to correlate vitreal and plasma miRNA signatures with NV AMD, highlighting potential future worth as biomarkers and providing insight on NV AMD pathogenesis.
