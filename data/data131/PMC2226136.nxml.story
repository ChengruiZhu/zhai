 During contractures of the turtle ventricle rapid changes in length induce sinusoidal oscillations under isotonic conditions. They are due to delayed responses to stretching and release, which can be demonstrated also under isometric conditions. Oscillations of two distinct frequencies are produced under different conditions and are distinguished as high- and low-frequency oscillations. In depolarized muscles the frequency is such that the duration of one cycle is about the same as that of a normal twitch, while in high-Ca solutions the duration can be the same as in high-K solutions or about six times lower. As reported previously, twitches are followed by weak mechanical and electrical oscillations. Their frequency agrees with the high-frequency oscillations. The same effects can also be induced by stretching and release. It is suggested that the phenomena observed are due to feedback mechanisms which originate in the contractile mechanism. The high-frequency oscillations are similar to those observed previously in other muscles, particularly insect fibrillar muscle, and are not due to changes in Ca concentration. The other mechanisms involve the membrane and possibly the intracellular Ca stores.
