Lucio phenomenon (LP) or erythema necroticans is a rare type of reaction pattern found in untreated patients with diffuse non-nodular leprosy. It is important to distinguish this from vasculonecrotic erythema nodosum because thalidomide with high-dose steroids is the mainstay of treatment for the latter, whereas LP shows no response to thalidomide. We report a case of a 60-year-old man who presented with purpuric patches, hemorrhagic blisters, and ulcers over extremities of 15 days duration. On cutaneous examination, there were multiple stellate purpuric patches, hemorrhagic bullae, and deep necrotic ulcers, mainly over extremities. Slit-skin smear examination from six sites revealed bacteriological index 6+ with globi, and morphological index 5%. Histopathology revealed diffuse infiltration of bacilli in epidermis, dermis, and endothelial cells along with neutrophilic and lymphocytic infiltrate. Fibrinoid necrosis and thrombosis of blood vessels was also noted. The above clinicohistopathological features helped in making the diagnosis of LP. Concomitantly he was found to be infected with hepatitis C virus. Many triggering factors have been described in literature; however, activation of hepatitis C as a trigger for Lucio phenomenon has not been reported. In addition, IgM and IgG anticardiolipin antibodies were found to be positive. The patient was started on high-dose steroids along with multibacillary antileprosy therapy and improved within 2 weeks.
