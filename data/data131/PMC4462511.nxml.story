We studied 82 patients with paroxysmal AF recorded at “Niculae Stancioiu” Heart Institute Cluj-Napoca, divided into two groups: group A treated with angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers (ARB) and group B without this medication. All patients underwent clinical examination, ECG, echocardiography and determination of plasma levels of inflammatory markers represented by high sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) and interleukin 6 (IL-6). In the group treated with ACE inhibitors/ARBs, AF burden was significantly lower than in patients without treatment. We obtained a strong positive correlation between blood levels of high-sensitivity CRP and those of IL-6 (r=0.64, p<0.001), the number of yearly AF episodes (r=0.570, p<0.001), LA diameter (r=0.5, p<0.001) and LA volume (r=0.5, p<0.001). We found moderate positive correlations between blood levels of IL-6 and LA diameter (r=0.305, p=0.01), LA volume (r=0.314, p=0.01), the number of yearly AF episodes (r=0.489, p<0.001), the total number of AF episodes (r=0.304, p<0.001), BMI (r=0.473, p<0.001), LA area (r=0.458, p<0.001), LA area index (r=0.334, p=0.007) and LA volume index (r=0.304, p=0.01). The number of yearly AF episodes and BMI values influenced IL-6 blood levels (t=3.46, p=0.001, respectively t=2.17, p=0.03).
