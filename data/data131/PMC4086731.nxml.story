These findings show that for every death from maternal sepsis in the UK, about 50 women develop life-threatening severe sepsis, that the onset of severe sepsis is very rapid, and that women who have recently had an infection are at particularly high risk of developing maternal sepsis. Although some pregnant women who developed severe sepsis during the study period may not have been included in the study, these findings have important clinical implications for the management of maternal sepsis in the UK and elsewhere. The findings suggest that pregnant or recently pregnant women with an infection need closer attention than women who are not pregnant, and adequate follow-up to ensure eradication of the infection. The findings also highlight the importance of giving high-dose intravenous antibiotics to anyone with suspected sepsis within an hour of admission to hospital as recommended by the international Surviving Sepsis Campaign, an initiative that was developed to improve the management, diagnosis, and treatment of sepsis. Finally, these findings suggest that signs of severe sepsis, particularly in women with a confirmed or suspected group A streptococcal infection, should be regarded as an obstetric emergency.
