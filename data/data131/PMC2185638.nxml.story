To investigate the antigenic relationship between the macrophage and lymphocyte Fc receptors (FcR), a monoclonal antibody capable of blocking mouse macrophage Fc receptors was selected. Hybrids were formed by fusing the P3U1 mouse myeloma and spleen cells from a rat immunized with the mouse macrophage-like cell lines J774 and P388D1. The Fab fragment of the monoclonal IgG secreted by clone 2.4G2, inhibited the trypsin-resistant Fc receptor II (FcRII), which is specific for immune aggregates of mouse IgG1 and IgG2b, but had no inhibitory effect on the trypsin-sensitive Fc receptor I (FcRI), which binds monomeric IgG2a and erythrocytes coated with IgG2a. Thus, the monoclonal 2.4G2 IgG appeared to be specific for macrophage FcRII. Further evidence that the 2.4G2 IgG was directed against FcRII came from binding studies of the monoclonal antibody to J774 cells and a series of independently isolated variants which do not express FcRII. These variants of J774 bound 5% as much of the monoclonal antibody as the parent line, which bound 600,000 molecules of 2.4G2 IgG per cell. The antigenic relatedness of mouse lymphocyte FcR to mouse macrophage FcRII was demonstrated by the binding of 2.4G2 IgG to FcR-bearing lymphoid cell lines and the inhibition of the lymphocyte FcR by the monoclonal antibody. Preincubation of spleen cells and peritioneal cells with 2.3G2 IgG likewise inhibited rosette formation with ox erythrocytes coated with rabbit IgG. The ability of the hybridoma IgG to inhibit mouse FcRII was independent of the major histocompatibility complex. The 2.4G2 IgG antigenic determinant was not present on rat, guinea pig, rabbit, or human FcR-bearing cells.
