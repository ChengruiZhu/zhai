Tumor necrosis factor/cachectin (TNF) is a mediator of the septic state, which involves diffuse abnormalities of coagulation throughout the vasculature. Since previous studies have shown that endothelial cells can play an active role in coagulation, we wished to determine whether TNF could modulate endothelial cell hemostatic properties. Incubation of purified recombinant TNF with cultured endothelial cells resulted in a time- and dose-dependent acquisition of tissue factor procoagulant activity. Concomitant with enhanced procoagulant activity, TNF also suppressed endothelial cell cofactor activity for the anticoagulant protein C pathway; both thrombin-mediated protein C activation and formation of functional activated protein C-protein S complex on the cell surface were considerably attenuated. Comparable concentrations of TNF (half-maximal affect at approximately 50 pM) and incubation times (half-maximal affect by 4 h after addition to cultures) were required for each of these changes in endothelial cell coagulant properties. This unidirectional shift in cell surface hemostatic properties favoring promotion of clot formation indicates that, in addition to leukocyte procoagulants, endothelium can potentially be instrumental in the pathogenesis of the thrombotic state associated with inflammatory and malignant disorders.
