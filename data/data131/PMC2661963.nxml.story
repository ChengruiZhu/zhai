Proteins that display multiple activities have typically evolved through the recruitment of different domains, each of which has a specific function. Thus, in a multifunctional protein, the different activities are mediated by spatially distinct domains such that a single domain can provide the specific chemical requirements for one activity. Indeed, current evolutionary theory argues that the colocalization of diverse activities within a single-domain enzyme is likely to be a rare event, as it would compromise the existing activity of the protein when a new function evolves. Nonetheless, a potential example of multifunctional recruitment into a single protein domain is provided by an enzyme that contains a cellulase enzyme module and a discrete noncatalytic cellulose-binding module. In this article, we show that the cellulose-binding module displays esterase activity and that these diverse activities are housed within the same site on the protein. Structural analysis of the enzyme reveals that its catalytic residues also contribute to the noncatalytic cellulose-binding function. This report provides a rare example of “gene sharing,” whereby the introduction of a second functionality into the active site of an enzyme does not compromise the original activity of the catalyst.
