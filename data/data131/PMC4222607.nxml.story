Multicellular organisms show an incredible diversity of cell types in their different tissues. Functional classes of cells can be attributed to the activation and repression of genes, which enable each cell type to support different functions within the organism. These patterns of activity have been studied by means of gene regulatory networks (GRNs). How these gene networks generate stable phenotypic states is thought to underlie the development and evolution of organisms. The pathways to these states are influenced by the autoregulatory properties of these networks. The stability and robustness of gene networks are used to investigate how such states are maintained. This study sheds light on how these properties relate to one another. By simulating the evolution of these networks, we show that genes depend on positive self-regulation to remain stable and robust when faced with random mutations or environmental perturbations. Assuming biological networks correspond to stable networks, our results suggest that biological networks should often be dominated by positive autoregulatory loops. This seems to be the case for most studied eukaryotic transcription factor networks, including those in yeast, flies and mammals.
