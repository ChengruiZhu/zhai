In nature, some proteins are more social than others, interacting with a large number of partners. These “promiscuous” proteins play key roles in cellular signaling pathways whose disruption may lead to diseases such as cancer. The amino acid sequences of such proteins must have evolved to be optimal for combined interactions with all natural partners. However, the evolutionary process leading to this promiscuity is not fully understood. We address this subject by predicting amino acid sequences that would be most compatible for interaction with each partner on its own and those most compatible for binding multiple proteins. We find that these two types of sequences are substantially different, the latter more closely resembling the natural sequences of promiscuous proteins. We also find that promiscuous proteins contain certain regions that are necessary for interfacing with all of their partners, while other regions convey specific interactions with each particular target protein. We analyze the tradeoffs required for such proteins to bind multiple partners and find that only some degree of compromise is typically needed in order to permit interactions that are seemingly antagonistic. We conclude that the simulations reported here mimic well the natural evolution of proteins that associate with multiple partners.
