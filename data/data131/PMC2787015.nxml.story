For a very long time, the measurement of the large scale potentials produced by the brain from outside of the head, using electroencephalography and magnetoencephalography, and from inside the head, using electrocorticography, has fixated on changes in specific rhythms and frequency ranges. This fixation presupposes physiologic changes where neuronal populations synchronously oscillate at specific timescales. Here, we demonstrate that there are phenomena which obey a broadband, power-law form extending across the entire frequency domain, with no special timescale. It is shown that, with local brain activity, there is an increase in power across all frequencies, and the power-law shape is conserved. Furthermore, we illustrate through simple simulation how fluctuations in this phenomenon may be linked to increases and decreases in “noise-like” patterns of activity in neuronal populations. Although power-laws have been postulated to exist in background electrical brain activity, the view that local activity can be captured by fluctuations in a broadband power-law in the power spectrum of electric potential timeseries represents a fundamentally new way of thinking about changes in the electric potential produced by the brain, and provides insight into what types of neuronal processes might produce these potentials.
