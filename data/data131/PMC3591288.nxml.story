The neural activity without explicit stimuli shows highly structured patterns in space and time, known as spontaneous activity. This spontaneous activity plays a key role in the behavior of the response to external stimuli generated by the interplay between the spontaneous activity and external input. Studying this interplay and how it is shaped by learning is an essential step toward understanding the principles of neural processing. To address this, we proposed a novel viewpoint, memories-as-bifurcations, in which the appropriate changes in the activity upon the input are embedded through learning. Based on this viewpoint, we introduce here an associative memory model with sequential learning by a simple Hebbian-type rule. In spite of its simplicity, the model memorizes the input/output mappings successively, as long as the input is sufficiently large and the synaptic change is slow. The spontaneous neural activity shaped after learning is shown to itinerate over the memorized targets in remarkable agreement with the experimental reports. These dynamics may prepare and facilitate to generate the learned response to the input. Our results suggest that this is the possible functional role of the spontaneous neural activity, while the uncovered network structure inspires a design principle for the memories-as-bifurcations.
