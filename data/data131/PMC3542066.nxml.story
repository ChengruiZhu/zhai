Cells employ protein phosphorylation – the addition of a phosphate group to serine, threonine or tyrosine residues – as a key regulatory mechanism for modulating protein function. Proteomics technologies can now quantify thousands of phosphorylation sites to reveal the dynamics of phosphorylation at each site in response to a biological process. It is known that phosphorylation does not occur randomly with regard to a protein's structure, but so far the relationship between the dynamics of phosphorylation and these structural properties has not been investigated. Here we relate the relative levels of phosphorylation for more than 5,000 sites through the cell cycle to the predicted structural features of the vicinity of the sites. We find that dynamic phosphorylation tends to occur in disordered regions, whereas phosphorylation sites that did not vary as much over the cell cycle are often located in defined secondary structure elements. Kinases that prefer charged amino acids in their substrate motives are more often associated with unchanging sites whereas proline-directed protein kinases phosphorylate cell cycle regulated sites in disordered regions more frequently. The structural organization of the region in which a phosphorylation site resides may therefore serve as an additional control mechanism in kinase mediated regulation.
