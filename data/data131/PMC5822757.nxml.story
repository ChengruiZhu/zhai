The mobile cecum syndrome includes a spectrum of conditions. The cecal volvulus represents the acute form, with typical feature of a bowel obstruction that needs immediate operative treatment. On the other hand, a chronic form of mobile cecum syndrome which is the most common form reported a history of intermittent crampy abdominal pain, distension, and constipation. In this study, five patients came to our attention during the last ten years, presenting different symptoms due to a mobile cecum. All patients were investigated by several diagnostic techniques according to the specific clinical setting. All patients were found to have the cecum and ascending colon unattached to the posterior peritoneum. Surgery was the treatment of choice. In our experience, the best diagnostic technique was computed tomography scan, especially if performed in the Trendelenburg position. We also propose virtual colonoscopy as a good option for diagnosis (in patients with chronic syndrome) and follow-up after surgery. In conclusion, laparoscopic approach guaranteed a good result, with no symptoms of recurrence, in both acute and elective treatments. The diagnosis of mobile cecum needs a high index of suspicion and a targeted radiological investigation. Surgery, especially laparoscopic cecopexy and appendectomy, is the recommended treatment.
