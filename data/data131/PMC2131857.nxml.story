 The alternating and continuous circuits produced different types of lesions in the central nervous system. Hemorrhages were common after alternating current shocks and few hemorrhages were observed in the continuous circuit group. With both types of circuits at 1000 and 500 volts potential, severe abnormalities in the nerve cells were observed. These were more marked in the continuous circuit group. A uniformly staining, shrunken, pyknotic nucleus was taken as a criterion of nerve cell death. The Purkinje cells of the cerebellum were most susceptible to the current. Injured cells were studied in the dorsal nucleus of the vagus, in the somatic motor group, among the primary sensory neurones and in the olives. Changes in the histological structure of the cells in reference to recovery have been discussed. Injury to the cerebral and cerebellar cortices occurred on the dorsal surface close to the head electrode. Small cavities were produced, particularly in the cerebral cortex, as the result of the circuit contact. With the continuous and alternating circuits at 110 and 220 volts potential less severe changes were observed in the nerve cells although hemorrhages were common in the alternating circuit group. It must be assumed in these cases that death was due to respiratory block rather than actual death of the cells.
