We examined the clinical and laboratory characteristics of children newly diagnosed with diabetes mellitus (DM) in a single-center study. We retrospectively reviewed the data of 155 children with DM between January 2000 and December 2013. Of 155 diabetic children, 87 (56.1%) were diagnosed with type 1 DM (T1DM) and 68 (43.9%) with type 2 DM (T2DM). Mean ages at diagnosis were 8.95±3.89 years (T1DM) and 13.76±2.23 years (T2DM), respectively (p<0.001). There were significant differences in HbA1c, C-peptide, and glutamic acid decarboxylase antibody levels between the T1DM and T2DM groups. Annual numbers of children with DM have increased, and since 2011 the number of children with T2DM has surpassed the number with T1DM. The most common clinical symptom in T1DM was polyuria, and 26.4% of children with T1DM presented initially with diabetic ketoacidosis. In contrast, 60.3% of T2DM children showed glucosuria in a school urine screening, and only 19.1% presented with polydipsia. The rate of positivity for at least more than one islet autoantibody was 77.1% in T1DM and 26.3% in T2DM. Serum C-peptide levels in T2DM were increased up to 12 months after onset and remained >3.59 ng/mL for 36 months. However, serum C-peptide levels in T1DM were slightly increased up to 6 months after onset and gradually decreased to 0.32 ng/mL for 36 months. The prevalence of children with DM has increased over the last 14 years, and the proportion of T2DM patients has rapidly increased since 2009. Because childhood DM is associated with several metabolic and cardiovascular complications, children should be screened for early detection of DM, especially asymptomatic T2DM in children and adolescents.
