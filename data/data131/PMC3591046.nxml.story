Fibro-osseous lesions of the jaws can have certain histologic features in common with central giant cell granuloma (CGCG) including the presence of multinucleated giant cells. The clinical, radiologic and histologic features of these lesions should be carefully evaluated to distinguish between these conditions. Fibro-osseous lesions of the jaws are a heterogenous group of lesions characterized by the replacement of normal bone by fibrovascular tissue containing newly formed mineralized material. Central giant cell lesions are defined as an intraosseus lesion consisting of cellular fibrous tissue containing multiple foci of hemorrhage and aggregation of multinucleated giant cells. These lesions may sometimes lead to a confusion in their diagnosis as many pathologists report them taking into consideration one of the prominent histopathologic feature. These confusions may be because of the small number of cases reported in the literature with uncertain clinical, radiographic and histopathologic features of these lesions. So even surgeons may end up treating these lesions inadequately or patients may need to undergo multiple surgeries. We report such a case of Juvenile ossifying fibroma associated with CGCG and discuss the clinical, imaging, histologic, and treatment aspects of this hybrid lesion.
