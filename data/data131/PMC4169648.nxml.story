A subchronic toxicity study was carried out to determine the glyphosate-induced histopathological changes in the stomach, liver, kidney, brain, pancreas and spleen of rats and the attendant ameliorative effect when pretreated with zinc at the dose rate of 50 mg/kg body weight. The rats were exposed to two doses of the glyphosate (375 and 14.4 mg/kg body weight) for the period of 8 weeks which was the duration of the study, and some groups were exposed to the glyphosate after pretreatment with zinc. The histopathological changes recorded during the study were only in the rats exposed to the glyphosate at the dose rate of 375 mg/kg body weight except the vacuolation encountered in the brains and haemosiderosis in the spleens of rats exposed to zinc alone. Degenerated mucosal epithelial cells which involved the muscularis mucosa and the glands in the stomachs of rats were seen microscopically. Hepatic cells degeneration especially at the portal areas of the livers of rats was observed. The histopathological examination of the kidneys showed glomerular degeneration, mononuclear cells infiltration into the interstices of the tubules and tubular necrosis. The conspicuous changes seen in the brains were neuronal degeneration. Pancreatic acinar cells were degenerated while the spleen of the rats showed depopulated splenic cells in both the red and the white pulps. It was concluded that zinc supplementation in rats prior to glyphosate exposure ameliorated the histopathological changes observed in the stomach, liver, kidney, brain, pancreas and spleen with no observable alteration in the histoarchitecture in the organs of the zinc-supplemented rats.
