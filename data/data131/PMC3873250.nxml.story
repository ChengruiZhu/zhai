Homologous recombination allows repair of DNA breaks from intact templates of identical sequence by a “copy-and-paste” like mechanism. However, the double Holliday Junction (dHJ) is a hazardous intermediate that can form during homologous recombination, if single stranded DNA from both ends of a lesion pair with the template. Once the primary lesion is eliminated, the dHJ connects the chromosomes stably and if unresolved can prevent segregation during cell division. In order to prevent chromosome non-disjunction, resolvases will cut any HJ before division. However, genomes contain many multi-copy DNA sequences as transposons or repetitive elements. If dHJs form between such non-allelic loci, cleavage by resolvases can result in chromosome translocations and deletions. Therefore, stabilization of dHJs is sought to be avoided in the first instance by anti-recombinogenic helicases on early intermediates. Analysis of Smc5/6-Mms21 mutants in meiosis revealed that it antagonizes unregulated dHJs both by prevention and resolution. Elimination of the Mms21 SUMO E3-ligase domain leads to inappropriate dHJ accumulation still resolved by Mus81-Mms4. Disruption of the whole complex results in persistent dHJ accumulation and dysfunction of resolvases, preventing chromatin segregation. These results provide a first unified view on the function of Smc5/6-Mms21 as an antagonist of dangerous dHJs.
