Highly pathogenic avian influenza H5N1 continues to spread rapidly between flocks of poultry in many parts of the world including areas in Southeast Asia and Africa where infection has become endemic. Meanwhile the number of human cases and fatalities are steadily accumulating. As a result, the control of outbreaks in poultry remains both a key public and animal health priority. In Vietnam control policies have evolved from a policy of reliance upon drastic “stamping out” measures to regular mass vaccination campaigns. Using Bayesian data augmentation techniques in order to take into account the unobserved infection times, we found that this has led to a significant reduction in the daily probability of transmission between communes but that the time taken to detect outbreaks has increased. As a result it is still possible for sustained transmission to occur, albeit at a slower rate. Through an analysis of the reconstructed epidemic tree, we found that any measures that have the effect of restoring detection capacity to that estimated for the “stamping out” policy would have a large effect upon the size and scale of any future outbreak wave and may be effective at preventing sustained transmission between communes.
