Understanding the “cellular programming” that controls fundamental, dynamic biological processes is important for determining normal cellular function and potential perturbations that might give rise to physiological disorders. Ideally, investigations would employ time series experiments to periodically measure the properties of each cell. This would allow us to understand the sequence of gene (in)activations that constitute the program being followed. In practice, such experiments can be difficult to perform as cellular activity may be asynchronous with each cell occupying a different phase of the process of interested. Furthermore, the unbiased measurement of all transcripts or proteins requires the cells to be captured and lysed precluding the continued monitoring of that cell. In the absence of the ability to conduct true time series experiments, pseudotime algorithms exploit the asynchronous cellular nature of these systems to mathematically assign a “pseudotime” to each cell based on its molecular profile allowing the cells to be aligned and the sequence of gene activation events retrospectively inferred. Existing approaches predominantly use deterministic methods that ignore the statistical uncertainties associated with the problem. This paper demonstrates that this statistical uncertainty limits the temporal resolution that can be extracted from static snapshots of cell expression profiles and can also detrimentally affect downstream analysis.
