In latently infected B lymphocytes, the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) suppresses signal transduction from the antigen receptor through expression of the integral latent membrane protein 2A (LMP2A). At the same time, LMP2A triggers B cell survival by a yet uncharacterized maintenance signal that is normally provided by the antigen receptor. The molecular mechanisms are unknown as LMP2A-regulated signaling cascades have not been described so far. Using a novel mouse model we have identified the intracellular adaptor protein Src homology 2 (SH2) domain–containing leukocyte protein (SLP)-65 as a critical downstream effector of LMP2A in vivo. Biochemical analysis of the underlying signaling pathways revealed that EBV infection causes constitutive tyrosine phosphorylation of one of the two SLP-65 isoforms and complex formation between SLP-65 and the protooncoprotein CrkL (CT10 regulator of kinase like). This leads to antigen receptor-independent phosphorylation of Cbl (Casitas B lineage lymphoma) and C3G. In contrast, phospholipase C-γ2 (PLC-γ2) activation is completely blocked. Our data show that in order to establish a latent EBV infection, LMP2A selectively activates or represses SLP-65–regulated signaling pathways.
