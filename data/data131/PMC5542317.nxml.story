After excluding patients who did not meet the criteria for study participation, a total of 193 patients were included in this study. At the time of surgery, one hundred eighty three patients (95%) demonstrated evidence of labralchondral pathology and bony morphology characteristic of femoroacetabular impingement (FAI). One hundred five patients (54%) received a pre-operative femoral nerve block and 88 patients (46%) received an intra-operative intra-articular injection of anesthetic agents. Linear models for post-operative pain, controlled for patient age and pre-operative pain levels, revealed that patients receiving pre-operative femoral nerve blocks had significantly less pain at discharge (p<0.05). There was no statistically significant difference in pain scores between patients receiving pre-operative femoral nerve blocks and those receiving intra-articular injections at post-operative weeks 1, 3 and 6. Patients receiving pre-operative femoral nerve blocks were found to be 3.6 times more likely to experience a post-operative fall (OR 3.58, p < 0.05) and were 14 times more likely to experience post-operative neuropathy (OR 13.99, p < 0.01) than patients receiving an intra-articular injection.
