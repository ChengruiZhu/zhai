Only a few studies in the literature have reported the contribution of endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) in ovarian tumors, and with regard to malignant tumors, the data on the pre-existing endothelium insertion rate and the extent to which these cells contribute to tumor angiogenesis is controversial. The present study demonstrated the existence of EPCs and evaluated the expression of two markers, AC133 (also known as cluster of differentiation 133 or prominin) and tyrosine kinase with immunoglobulin-like and EGF-like domains 2 (Tie2), signaling the presence of EPCs in the pre-existing endothelium. In total, 62 female patients who were diagnosed with ovarian tumors were retrospectively selected over a four-year period. Immunohistochemical analyses used Tie2 and AC133 as primary antibodies. In total, 27.4% of ovarian tumor cases expressed AC133 and Tie2 in blood vessel endothelial cells. The expression of these two markers did not correlate with the clinicopathological prognostic parameters, histological type, vascular microdensity or vessel type. The expression of AC133 and Tie2 in blood vessel endothelial cells contributes to angiogenesis progression in cases where the budding process is reduced or absent, as shown by the inverse correlation with the rate of proliferation of the endothelial cells.
