Current wound sealing systems such as nanoparticle‐based gluing of tissues allow almost immediate wound sealing. The assistance of a laser beam allows the wound sealing with higher controllability due to the collagen fiber melting which is defined by loss of tertiary protein structure and restoration upon cooling. Usually one employs dyes to paint onto the wound, if water absorption bands are absent. In case of strong bleeding or internal wounds such applications are not feasible due to low welding depth in case of water absorption bands, dyes washing off, or the dyes becoming diluted within the wound. One possible solution of these drawbacks is to use autonomously movable particles composing of biocompatible gold and magnetite nanoparticles and biocompatible polyelectrolyte complexes. In this paper a proof of principle study is presented on the utilization of thermophoretic Janus particles and capsules employed as dyes for infrared laser‐assisted tissue welding. This approach proves to be efficient in sealing the wound on the mouse in vivo. The temperature measurement of single particle level proves successful photothermal heating, while the mechanical characterizations of welded liver, skin, and meat confirm mechanical restoration of the welded biological samples.
