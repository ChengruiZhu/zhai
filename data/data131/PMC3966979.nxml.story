The MEK/ERK and PI3K/AKT pathways are often concurrently activated by separate genetic alterations in colorectal cancer (CRC), which is associated with CRC progression and poor survival. However, how activating both pathways is required for CRC metastatic progression remains unclear. Our recent study showed that both ERK and AKT signaling are required to activate eIF4E-initiated cap-dependent translation via convergent regulation of the translational repressor 4E-BP1 for maintaining CRC transformation. Here, we identified that the activation of cap-dependent translation by cooperative ERK and AKT signaling is critical for promotion of CRC motility and metastasis. In CRC cells with coexistent mutational activation of ERK and AKT pathways, inhibition of either MEK or AKT alone showed limited activity in inhibiting cell migration and invasion, but combined inhibition resulted in profound effects. Genetic blockade of the translation initiation complex by eIF4E knockdown or expression of a dominant active 4E-BP1 mutant effectively inhibited migration, invasion and metastasis of CRC cells, whereas overexpression of eIF4E or knockdown of 4E-BP1 had the opposite effect and markedly reduced their dependence on ERK and AKT signaling for cell motility. Mechanistically, we found that these effects were largely dependent on the increase in mTORC1-mediated survivin translation by ERK and AKT signaling. Despite the modest effect of survivin knockdown on tumor growth, reduction of the translationally-regulated survivin profoundly inhibited motility and metastasis of CRC. These findings reveal a critical mechanism underlying the translational regulation of CRC metastatic progression, and suggest that targeting cap-dependent translation may provide a promising treatment strategy for advanced CRC.
