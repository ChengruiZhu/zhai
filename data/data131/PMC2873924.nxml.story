Dystrophin functions like a large molecular spring between the muscle cytoskeleton and the extracellular matrix in order to protect the membrane from contraction-induced injury. Mutations in dystrophin can lead to a severe muscle wasting disease called Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) in young boys. DMD patients are typically wheelchair bound by 9–13 years of age and die at approximately 30 years. There are also mutations within the dystrophin gene that lead to internal truncations of non-essential regions, such as the internal rod domain that leads to a mild form of the disease called Becker Muscular Dystrophy. However, these internal truncations frequently occur at a “hot spot” within the rod domain where the resulting disease severity is difficult to predict. Here we found that consecutive proline residues, that function much like a molecular ruler, can dramatically influence the function of these internally truncated dystrophins within skeletal muscles. Using this information, we designed a dystrophin mini-gene that can accommodate the limited packaging size of recombinant adeno-associated virus. This virus can deliver the dystrophin mini-gene to most muscles throughout a dystrophic mouse to prevent muscle degeneration and partially restore muscle function.
