Among 382 patients—197 in the HB and 185 in the CAU-group—226 (59%) were male, mean age was 71.5 (SD 11.2), 45.5% being ≥75 years of age; 57% of the patients were in NYHA HF class 2, 40% in class 3 and 3% in class 4. Both study groups were similar for demographic and clinical characteristics. Mean time to first heart failure related hospitalization was 161 days for the intervention group and 139 days for the usual-care group; hospitalizations occurred in 18 (9.1%) compared to 25 patients (13.5%) respectively (Kaplan–Meier p=0.151, hazard ratio 0.65, CI 0.35–1.17). Combined endpoint of heart failure admission and all cause mortality was similar for both groups (Kaplan–Meier p=0.641 hazard ratio 0.89, CI 0.69–1.83). Cox regression analysis disclosed an important interaction between group assignment and heart failure duration, p=0.007, OR=0.983, CI 0.970–0.995 indicating a significant decrease in heart failure hospitalizations in the intervention group if heart failure duration was <18 months, p=0.026, hazard ratio 0.26, CI 0.07–0.94. Contacts with the heart-failure-nurse were mean 1.36 (range 0–11) in the intervention group vs. 1.74 (0–8) in the usual-care group (Mann-Whitney p<0.001). Mortality was 18 (9.1%) in the intervention-group and 12 (6.5%) in the usual-care-group (Mann–Whitney p=0.34, Cox-regression analysis p=0.82).
