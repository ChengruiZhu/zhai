The aim of this article is to review rheumatological diseases that are associated with glucocorticoid‐induced osteoporosis or fractures and to perform a critical analysis of the current guidelines and treatment regimens. The electronic database MEDLINE was searched using the date range of July 1986 to June 2009 and the following search terms: osteoporosis, bone mineral density, fractures, systemic lupus erythematosus, rheumatoid arthritis, systemic sclerosis, vasculitis, juvenile rheumatoid arthritis, juvenile idiopathic arthritis and juvenile dermatomyositis. Osteopenia and osteoporosis respectively account for 1.4 to 68.7% and 5.0 to 61.9% of adult rheumatological diseases. Among juvenile rheumatological disorders, the frequency of low bone mass ranges from 38.7 to 70%. In general, fracture rates vary from 0 to 25%. Although glucocorticoid‐induced osteoporosis has a high rate of prevalence among rheumatic diseases, a relatively low number of patients on continuous glucocorticoid treatment receive adequate diagnostic evaluation or preventive therapy. This deficit in patient care may result from a lack of clear understanding of the attributed risks by the patients and physicians, the high complexity of the treatment guidelines and poor patient compliance.
