Operative limbs had higher peak hip adduction (-0.14° ± 7.3 vs. -6.1° ± 5.0, =0.01) and higher average external knee valgus moments (0.16 Nm/kg ± 0.50 vs. -0.21Nm/kg ± 0.58, p=0.02) compared to control limbs. In terms of shock absorption, operative limbs had lower peak ground reaction forces (23.2 N/kg ± 4.7 vs. 28.3 N/kg ± 5.8, p<0.0001) and peak ankle dorsiflexion (14.5° ± 7.5 vs. 20.0° ± 6.4, p=0.002) compared to control limbs with lower peak external knee flexor moments (1.4 Nm/kg ± 0.61 vs. 2.0 Nm/kg ± 0.63, p<0.0001) and less power absorption at the knee (0.38 Ws/kg ± 0.31 vs. 0.55Ws/kg ± 0.34, p=0.05) and ankle (0.43 Ws/kg ± 0.21 vs. 0.65 Ws/kg ± 0.41, p=0.01). Though non-operative limbs had less knee valgus (-1.0° ± 3.5 vs. 1.1° ± 3.3, p=0.04) at initial contact, they had higher peak knee valgus (3.6° ± 5.7 vs. 0.58° ± 4.1, p=0.04) and higher average external knee valgus moments (0.09 Nm/kg ±0.59 vs. -0.21Nm/kg ±0.58, p=0.06) compared to control limbs. Non-operative limbs also had less pelvic obliquity compared to control limbs (10.4° ± 5.8 vs. 14.6° ± 7.7, p=0.04). Lower peak ground reaction forces (24.5 N/kg ± 4.5 vs. 28.3 N/kg ± 5.8, p=0.005), increased power absorption at the hip (0.43 Ws/kg ± 0.48 vs. 0.15 Ws/kg ± 0.23, p=0.005), and decreased power absorption at the ankle (0.49 Ws/kg ± 0.23 vs. 0.65 Ws/kg ± 0.41, p=0.09) were seen in non-operative compared to control limbs.
