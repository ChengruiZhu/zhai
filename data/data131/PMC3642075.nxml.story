This paper focuses on infectious diseases such as monkeypox, Nipah virus and avian influenza that transmit weakly from human to human. These pathogens cannot cause self-sustaining epidemics in the human population, but instead cause limited transmission chains that stutter to extinction. Such pathogens would go extinct if they were confined to humans, but they persist because of continual introduction from an external reservoir (such as animals, for the zoonotic diseases mentioned above). They are important to study because they pose a risk of emerging if they become more transmissible, or conversely to monitor the success of efforts to locally eliminate a pathogen by vaccination. A crucial challenge for these ‘stuttering’ pathogens is to quantify their transmissibility, in terms of the intensity and heterogeneity of disease transmission by infected individuals. In this paper, we use monkeypox as an example to show how these transmission properties can be estimated from commonly available data describing the size of observed stuttering chains. These results make it easier to monitor diseases that pose a risk of emerging (or re-emerging) as self-sustaining human pathogens, or to decide whether a seemingly large chain may signal a worrisome change in transmissibility.
