Mammary gland regression at the cessation of lactation (involution) is an exquisitely orchestrated process of cell death and tissue remodelling in which Stat3 signalling has an essential role. The involution microenvironment of the mammary gland is considered to be pro-tumourigenic and a proportion of cases of pregnancy-associated breast cancer are suggested to originate in tandem with involution. However, the apparent paradox that STAT3 is required for cell death in normal mammary gland, but is associated with breast cancer cell survival, has not been resolved. Herein, we investigate Stat3-mediated regulation of expression of members of the calcium-activated chloride channel regulator (CLCA) family of proteins during involution and mammary carcinogenesis. Using the conditionally immortal mammary epithelial cell line KIM-2, together with mice exhibiting mammary epithelial cell-specific deletion of Stat3 during lactation, we demonstrate that expression of mCLCA1 and mCLCA2 is elevated in concert with activation of Stat3. By contrast, murine CLCA5 (mCLCA5), the murine orthologue of human CLCA2, is significantly upregulated at 24, 72 and 96â€‰h of involution in Stat3 knockout mice, suggesting a reciprocal regulation of these proteins by Stat3
