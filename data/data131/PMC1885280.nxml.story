Methylation of lysines 9 or 27 of histone H3 (H3me3K9 or H3me3K27, respectively) has been associated with silenced chromatin. However, a comprehensive comparison of the regions of the genome bound by these two types of modified histone H3 has not been performed. Therefore, we compared the binding patterns of H3me3K9 and H3me3K27 at ~26,000 human promoters in four different cell populations. Our studies indicated that the two marks segregate differentially with the two most common types of transcriptional regulators; H3me3K27 is highly enriched at homeobox genes and H3me3K9 is highly enriched at zinc-finger genes (ZNFs). We showed that many of the promoters bound by H3me3K9 are also bound by the corepressor KAP1. A genome-wide screen for KAP1 target genes revealed a difference in the location of KAP1 binding sites in the ZNF genes versus other targets. In general, KAP1 binding sites were localized to core promoter regions. However, KAP1 binding sites associated with ZNF genes are near the 3′ end of the coding region. Our results suggest that the KRAB-ZNF family members participate in an autoregulatory loop involving binding of the KAP1 protein to the 3′ end of the ZNF target genes, resulting in trimethylation of H3K9 and transcriptional repression.
