Black blood magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)is a promising imaging tool in predicting aneurysm rupture. Could it be also valuable in evaluating the treatment effect of endovascular and conservative treated aneurysms? Two patients were treated with stent and coil and one with Aspirine (ASS). Correlation of treatment response and contrast enhancement of the aneurysm wall is examined. In the first case stenting failed to treat the aneurysm and contrast enhancement in the wall did never subside during follow up black blood MRI. In the second case the aneurysm responded well to stenting and decreased in size, which was correlating significantly with attenuation of contrast enhancement in black blood MRI. In the third case the aneurysm responded to ASS treatment by decreasing in size as shown in follow up MR-angiography and the contrast enhancement in its wall decreased after 8 months of therapy. Black blood MRI seems to be a promising tool not only in predicting aneurysms at risk of rupture, but also in observing treatment responses after endovascular procedures or even Aspirine administration. When contrast enhancement decreases, aneurysm treatment seems to be successful as can be shown in decreasing size in the follow up angiography.
