Mycotic aneurysm of the aorta is a rare, but life-threatening pathology. In recent years, endovascular stent graft placement has been introduced as an effective alternative for treating infected aortic aneurysms. A 64-year-old woman with a history of paraplegia due to spinal cord injury was referred to our institute with fever and blood-tinged sputum. Computed tomography (CT) scan showed an 11-cm pseudoaneurysm arising from the proximal descending aorta, which was normal 1 month ago at the previous CT scan. The patient underwent thoracic endovascular aortic repair for the pseudoaneurysm, deployed with a transiliac access approach, and received antibacterial medical therapy. On postoperative day 11, she developed signs of infection, caused by an aortoesophageal fistula. The infection was treated conservatively with parenteral nutrition and antibiotic administration. The patient had an uneventful recovery and was discharged on postoperative day 113. At 2-year follow-up, she had a normal physical examination and CT angiography showed a marked reduction of the pseudoaneurysm sac. We report a successful endovascular stent grafting and subsequent medical treatment in a patient with a mycotic thoracic aortic pseudoaneurysm followed by a postoperative aortoesophageal fistula.
