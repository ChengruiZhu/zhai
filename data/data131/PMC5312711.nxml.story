 imaging model that allows the observation of split femurs, ectopically transplanted into a dorsal skinfold chamber of a host mouse. Repeated, long term observations are facilitated by multiphoton microscopy, an imaging technique that combines superior imaging capacity at greater tissue depth with low phototoxicity. The transplanted, ectopic femur was stabilized by its sterile environment and rapidly connected to the host vasculature, allowing further development and observation of extended processes. After optimizing transplant age and grafting procedure, we observed the development of new woven bone and maturation of secondary ossification centers in the transplanted femurs, preceded by the sprouting of a sinusoidal-like vascular network, which was almost entirely composed of femoral endothelial cells. After two weeks, the transplant was still populated with stromal and haematopoietic cells belonging both to donor and host. Over this time frame, the transplant partially retained myeloid progenitor cells with single and multi-lineage differentiation capacity. In summary, our model allowed repeated intravital imaging of bone marrow angiogenesis and hematopoiesis. It represents a promising starting point for the development of improved chronic optical imaging models for femoral bone marrow.
