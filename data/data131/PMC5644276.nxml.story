A total of 204 evaluable responses were collected with the majority from North America and Europe (83.4%) and the remainder from Asia, Latin America, and Mideast/Africa. The mean (SD) number of subjects personally assessed by the respondents in the past year with MCI, mild-moderate dementia, or severe dementia was 12.8 (26.2), 31.2 (39.6), and 10.1 (34.7), respectively. The mean number of subjects in each diagnostic group with suicidal ideation (SI), suicidal behavior (SB), or completed suicide (CS) was on average quite low (0.3 to 1.1 for SI, 0.1 to 0.2 for SB, and 0.0 to 0.2 for CS). Confidence in subject self-reports of SI/SB over different time periods declined with increasing severity of cognitive impairment and with increasing duration of the recall time period assessed. Of respondents, 56% and 75% had low confidence in self-ratings of SI/SB from subjects with severe dementia over the past 24 hours and the past week to 1 month, respectively. Ratings of the reliability of information collected on SI/SB also decreased with increasing severity of cognitive impairment. Approximately 70% of respondents rated the reliability of the information they obtained from all sources (patient, caregiver, and others) for subjects with MCI as high, but only about half (42.0% to 55.3%) and less than a quarter (17.4% to 24.3%) rated the reliability of information obtained for subjects with mild to moderate dementia or severe dementia as high, respectively.
