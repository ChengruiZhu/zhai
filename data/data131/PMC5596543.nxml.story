The fucosyltransferase (FUT) family produces glycans, a fundamental event in several cancers, including colorectal cancer (CRC). miR-125a-3p is a non-coding RNA that can reduce cell proliferation and migration in cancer. In this study, we explored the levels of miR-125a-3p and FUT expression in human CRC tissues and two human CRC cell lines by qPCR. The results showed that miR-125a-3p, FUT5 and FUT6 are differentially expressed in normal and tumour tissues. On the basis of our previous research, FUT can be regulated by miRNA, which influences the proliferation and invasion of breast and hepatocellular cancer cells. We hypothesised that FUT5 and FUT6 may be regulated by miR-125a-3p. Luciferase reporter analyses were applied to identify potential target genes of miR-125a-3p. A functional study showed that miR-125a-3p overexpression can inhibit the proliferation, migration, invasion and angiogenesis of CRC cells via down-regulating FUT5 and FUT6. In addition, regulating miR-125a-3p, FUT5 or FUT6 expression markedly modulated the activity of the PI3K/Akt signalling pathway, and this effect of FUT5 or FUT6 could be reversed by transfection with miR-125a-3p-mimics. Taken together, our data suggest that both FUT5 and FUT6 can promote the development of CRC via the PI3K/Akt signalling pathway, which is regulated by miR-125a-3p. miR-125a-3p may serve as a predictive biomarker and a potential therapeutic target in CRC treatment.
