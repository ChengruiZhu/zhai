 < 0.001). Between methods, the absolute differences in mean area and volume of necrotic core were 0.02 ± 0.02 mm² and 0.34 ± 0.29 mm³, respectively, while for mean area and volume of dense calcium, the absolute differences were 0.04 ± 0.07 mm² and 0.36 ± 0.52 mm³, respectively. The reproducibility of Shin’s method was excellent. For area of the necrotic core and dense calcium, the means of the differences between the two measurements were nearly zero, and the reproducibility coefficients were within 1% of the means of the two measurements. Mean analysis time for both measurements was 26.8 ± 6.7 min/segment in the conventional method and 3.3 ± 0.6 min/segment in Shin’s method. Shin’s method for measurement of necrotic core and dense calcium using VH-IVUS demonstrated a good correlation with the conventional method and excellent reproducibility. Also, Shin’s method required a significantly shorter analysis time than the conventional method. Therefore, Shin’s method could replace the conventional method for necrotic core and calcium measurement in atherosclerotic lesions, and it might be useful in the catheterization laboratory for online clinical decision.
