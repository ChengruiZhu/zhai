The accurate preservation and correct retrieval of genetic information is crucial for all living organisms. In eukaryotes, whether single-celled yeast or complex mammals, the DNA containing the genetic information is wrapped around beads of histone proteins to form structures called nucleosomes along the length of the DNA; this packaging arrangement helps protect the genome from damage and may restrict access to the genetic information. Until recently, the amount of histones and, consequently, the number of nucleosomes in the cell were considered fixed. Here, we show that in both mammalian and yeast cells that lack a single protein—HMGB1 in mammals or Nhp6a/b in yeast—the abundance of histones and nucleosomes decreases by 20%–30%. Contrary to expectations, we found that in yeast the nucleosomes do not redistribute along DNA when they are fewer: they largely maintain their positions, but the amount of time each specific DNA site spends wrapped in a nucleosome (i.e., its occupancy) decreases. Sequences that are already less frequently occupied than others in normal yeast cells lose disproportionally more nucleosomes in the mutant yeast that lack Nhp6a/b. This gives rise to a global increase in transcription and specific alterations in the expression of certain genes. This study thus contributes to a deeper understanding of how the DNA is packaged and organized. It also suggests that the cell's histone content might contribute in an important way to gene regulation.
