In mammals, oocyte reawakening controls female fertility, the onset of the menopause, and thus, overall aging. We demonstrate here through complementary genetic experiments that Kit is the upstream receptor regulating oocyte reawakening. Although other cell surface receptors have been proposed as candidates, the data have remained contradictory, and definitive genetic evidence in support of any one receptor has been lacking. We engineered two novel Kit alleles in mice, one an activating (gain-of-function) mutation, the other an inactivating (loss-of-function) mutation. These alleles permitted us to conduct elegant genetic experiments whereby Kit was activated or inactivated in the oocytes of newborn mice. The results were complementary and striking. Oocyte-specific Kit activation resulted in female sterility due to reawakening of all oocytes, leading to premature ovarian failure. In contrast, Kit inactivation also led to female sterility and ovarian failure, but through a contrasting and opposite phenotype: a complete failure of primordial follicle reawakening. Additional studies demonstrated that Foxo3, a known regulator of reawakening, was the mediator of both phenotypes, linking our findings to prior discoveries. These complementary genetic experiments thus definitively incriminate Kit as the upstream receptor regulating reawakening.
