Dens invaginatus is a developmental anomaly, caused by deepening of the enamel organ into the dental papilla before calcification of the dental tissues. Teeth with dens invagination are susceptible to early caries and pulp necrosis within a few years of eruption or even before root end closure. This article reports two immature maxillary central incisors with type I and III dens invaginatus which had necrotic pulp and a large periradicular lesion, that were treated successfully by nonsurgical root canal treatment. After apical plug placement, the remaining space was backfilled using warm vertical gutta-percha technique and the crowns were restored by composite restoration. At 6 months of follow up the patient was asymptomatic and probing depths were less than 3 mm. In addition, the reduction in the size of apical radiolucencies was observed by radiographic examinations. This case report revealed that even type III des invaginatus with an open apex and large periapical lesion, can be treated non-surgically using MTA as an apical plug. Although this case report presents a favorable result, further studies with long term follow-up periods are encouraged to support the use of nonsurgical endodontic treatment for type III dens invaginatus.
