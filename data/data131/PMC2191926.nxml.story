We have previously shown that CD4+ T cells from allergic individuals are predisposed to produce interleukin (IL)-4 in response to allergens, and that allergen immunotherapy greatly reduced IL-4 production in an allergen-specific fashion. The mechanism that results in the reduction of IL-4 synthesis in treated individuals is unknown, but because clinical improvement during immunotherapy is associated with the administration of the highest doses of allergen, we hypothesized that high concentration of allergen results in the downregulation of IL-4 synthesis in CD4+ T cells. In this report, we demonstrated that CD4+ T cells from allergic donors produced high levels of IL-4 when stimulated with low concentrations of allergen (0.003-0.01 micrograms/ml), particularly when B cell-enriched populations presented the antigen. In contrast, the same responding CD4+ T cell population produced little IL- 4 when stimulated with high concentrations of allergen (10-30 micrograms/ml), especially when monocytes were used as antigen- presenting cells (APC). The quantity of IL-4 produced was also found to be inversely related to the extent of proliferation of the CD4+ T cells in response to allergen/antigen; maximal proliferation of CD4+ T cells occurred in response to high concentrations of antigen when IL-4 production was minimal. Antigen presentation by B cell-enriched populations, instead of monocytes, induced less CD4+ T cell proliferation, but induced much greater IL-4 synthesis. Moreover, the addition of increasing numbers of APC (either B cells or monocytes) to cultures containing a constant number of responder T cells resulted in increased T cell proliferation and decreased IL-4 production. These results indicate that the circumstances under which memory T cells are activated, as well as the strength of the proliferative signal to T cells, greatly affect the quantity of IL-4 produced. Thus, our observations that the cytokine profile of allergen-specific memory CD4+ T cells can indeed be modulated by the antigen dose and APC type suggest that methods that preferentially enhance allergen uptake by monocytes and that enhance T cell proliferation will improve the clinical efficacy of immunotherapy in the treatment of allergic disease.
