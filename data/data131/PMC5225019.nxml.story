Protein sequence data, when gathered in great quantity, contain important but implicit biological information manifest as statistical correlations. Here we describe an approach to access this information by comprehensively modeling and characterizing the distribution of sequences belonging to a major protein superfamily. This approach takes as input a large set of unaligned sequences belonging to the superfamily. By applying the minimum description length principle, it seeks the statistical model that best explains the sequences while avoiding over-fitting the data. It concurrently aligns the sequences and, to model evolutionary divergence, partitions them into subgroups that are hierarchically-arranged based upon correlated residue patterns. Auxiliary routines create PyMOL scripts to visualize the locations of correlated residues within available structures. Because these correlations likely arise from structural and biochemical constraints, they can help elucidate protein properties important for functional specificity. Comparing and contrasting sequence and structural features in this way may therefore suggest, in the light of published studies, plausible biological hypotheses for experimental investigation. We illustrate this approach with N-acetyltransferases.
