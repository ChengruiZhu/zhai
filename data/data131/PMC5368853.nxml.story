To analyze the predictive effect of thrombelastogram (TEG) in the changes of coagulation functions of patients with traumatic brain hemorrhage, as well as to provide a practice basis for clinical guidance. 54 cases were observed from Aug. 2013–Oct. 2014. All patients received a TEG test 1d, 3d and 7d after traumatic injury. According to the statistical analysis, the comparison among the aforementioned coagulation function parameters in each group of patients, K, α and Ma all had significant differences. In the comparison between different time points in the same group, there was still a significant difference. Compared to the patients, the changes of R and K reached the lowest at 1d and the highest at 3d, but there was no significant difference between two groups at 7d. The changes of α and Ma reached its highest at 1d and the lowest at 3d after traumatic injury, but there was no significant difference at 7d. There was some difference in changes of coagulation functions between all groups. The former was more serious and the changes of coagulation functions had certain regularity, i.e., after traumatic injury, 1d showed a hypercoagulable state; 3d showed a hypocoagulable state; the coagulation functions of 7d returned to normal.
