After three decades of intensive research, cytoreductive surgery remains the gold standard of treatment of malignant gliomas. Survivorship at both 1-year and 5-years has not drastically changed in the UK. Concomitant chemo- and radiotherapy has enhanced the efficiency of surgery, enabling more aggressive tumour resection whilst also preserving the surrounding healthy brain parenchyma. More accurate imaging techniques have also played a role in tumour identification, key to this has been pre- and intra-operative contrast enhancement and compounds that have a high affinity in binding to glioma cells. Intra-operative imaging has heralded the ability to give the operating surgeon continuous feedback to assess the completeness of resection. Research is shifting into investigating the complex cellular and molecular glial tumour-genesis, and has led to the development of efficacious chemotherapy agents and trial novel therapies. Oncolytic virotherapy has shown promise in clinical trials and gene therapy in-vitro studies. Surgery however remains the primary therapeutic option for the management of malignant gliomas removing the mass of proliferating malignant tumour cells and decompression of the space-occupying lesion.
