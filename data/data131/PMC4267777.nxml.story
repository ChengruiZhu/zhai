The life cycle of a virus involves serial coordination of viral molecular machines. These machines facilitate functions such as membrane fusion and genome delivery during infection, and capsid formation and genome packaging during replication and shedding. Icosahedral dsDNA viruses use one genome-translocation machine for both genome delivery and packaging. The genome-translocation machine of the membrane-containing bacterial virus PRD1 is composed of four packaging protein species at a unique vertex. Because these proteins do not follow the dominating icosahedral symmetry of the viral capsid, the structure of this vertex has remained elusive. In this study, we localize the unique vertex in the virus from raw electron cryo-microscopy images of the virus. We show that the genome-packaging complex of PRD1 replaces the regular 5-fold structure at the unique vertex and contains a transmembrane conduit as a genome translocation channel. We extend our structural studies to the procapsid—a precursor of the virus—and three packaging mutant particles, allowing us to localize all individual protein species in the complex. Based on these structures, we propose a model of the molecular mechanism of assembly and packaging in the life cycle of the PRD1 virus.
