Cerebral hemorrhage is a serious complication of intracranial artery stenting that could be fatal without timely identification and treatment. Prompt brain CT scan would help to evaluate whether cerebral hemorrhage occurs, however, the diverse features of the CT scan immediately after stenting could influence the judgement sometimes. Therefore, we analyzed and summarized these features to help to determine the clinical significance of these CT features. The prompt CT features after stenting were classified into three types. Type I indicates that no high-density shadows. Type II indicates that high-density shadows scattered in the infarct areas and/or subarachnoid spaces without mass effect. Type III indicates high-density shadows scattered in and/or out of the infarct areas and/or subarachnoid space with obvious mass effects. Based on this classification, the patients in both Type I and II would continue the double anti-platelet treatment (DAPT) and anti-coagulation treatment, while the later need closer monitoring. However, patients in Type III must immediately withdraw the DAPT and anti-coagulation treatment with close monitoring and surgical intervention was needed when necessary. Nineteen (3.79%) patients were classified into Type III, and 5 (1.00%) of the 19 were accepted surgical intervention. Two of these patients died (0.40%). The prompt CT scan timely distinguishing the cerebral hemorrhage was necessary after intracranial artery stent angioplasty. Additionally, based on the different prompt CT features to take different therapeutic strategies after stenting would achieve better outcomes for ischemic stroke or transient ischemic stroke (TIA) patients underwent intracranial artery endovascular therapy.
