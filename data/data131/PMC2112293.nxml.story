The objective of this study was to determine whether transformed cells have greater DNA synthesis-inducing ability (DSIA) than normal cells when fused with G1 phase cells. HeLa cells synchronized in G1 phase, prelabeled with large latex beads, were fused separately with (a) quiescent human diploid fibroblasts (HDF), (b) HDF partially synchronized in late G1, and random populations of (c) HeLa, (d) WI-38, (e) SV-40 transformed WI-38, (f) CHO, (g) chemically transformed mouse cells (AKR-MCA), and (h) T98G human glioblastoma cells (all prelabeled with small latex beads) using UV-inactivated Sendai virus. The fusion mixture was incubated with [3H] thymidine, sampled at regular intervals, and processed for radioautography. Among the heterodikaryons, the frequency of those with a labeled and an unlabeled nuclei (L/U) were scored as a function of time after fusion. The faster the induction of DNA synthesis in HeLa G1, the steeper the drop in the L/U class and hence the higher DSIA in the S phase cells. The DSIA, which is indicative of the intracellular levels of the inducers of DNA synthesis, was the highest in HeLa and virally transformed WI-38 cells and the lowest in normal human diploid fibroblasts (HDF) while those of chemically and spontaneously transformed cells are intermediate between these two extremes. Higher level of DNA synthesis inducers appears to be one of the pleotropic effects of transformation by DNA tumor viruses. These studies also revealed that initiation of DNA synthesis per se is regulated by the presence of inducers and not by inhibitors.
