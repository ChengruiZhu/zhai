Increasing evidence points to an important functional or regulatory role of long noncoding RNA in cellular processes as well as cancer diseases resulted from the aberrant lncRNA expression. LncRNA could participate in the cancer progression and develop a significant role through the interaction with proteins. In the present study, we report a lncRNA termed uc.345 that is up-regulated in tumor tissues, compared to the corresponding noncancerous tissues. We found that a higher uc.345 expression level was more frequently observed in tissues with increased depth of invasion and advanced TNM tumor node metastasis T stage. Moreover, uc.345 could be used as an independent risk factor for the overall survival (OS) of the pancreatic cancer patients. By employing soft agar assays and tumor xenograft models, we showed that uc.345 could accelerate tumor growth. Further, we discovered that uc.345 could upregulate the hnRNPL expression and that inhibition of (hnRNPL) dampens the tumorigenesis capability of uc.345. Collectively, these results demonstrate that uc.345 functions as an oncogenic lncRNA that promotes tumor progression and serves as a poor predictor for pancreatic cancer patients' overall survival.
