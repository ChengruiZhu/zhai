The effects exerted on the in vitro development of antigen-specific T cell lines and T cell clones by addition or neutralization of interleukin 12 (IL-12) in lymphocyte bulk culture were examined. T cell lines specific for Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus group I (Der p I) derived in the presence of IL-12 exhibited reduced ability to produce IL-4 and increased ability to produce interferon gamma (IFN-gamma), and developed into Der p I-specific CD4+ T cell clones showing a T helper type 0 (Th0)- or Th1-, instead of Th2-, like cytokine profile. In contrast, purified protein derivative (PPD)-specific T cell lines derived in the presence of anti-IL-12 antibody exhibited an increased ability to produce IL-4 and developed into PPD-specific CD4+ T cell clones showing a Th0-, instead of Th1-, like profile. The influence of IL-12 on the cytokine secretion profile of Der p I-specific T cell lines was not prevented by addition to lymphocyte bulk cultures of anti- IFN-gamma antibody, but could be at least partially inhibited by the removal from bulk cultures of CD16+ cells. Thus, IL-12 and CD16+ cells appear to have inhibitory effects on the development of IL-4-producing cells and to play an inductive role in promoting Th1-like responses.
