The current study presents the case of a patient with a recurrent carcinoid tumor of the ovary, 13-years after the primary surgery. The primary surgery consisted of a total abdominal hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy for a left ovarian tumor at 54 years old. Pathologically, the tumor was diagnosed as a carcinoid tumor of the ovary. Following the primary treatment, the patient was admitted to a cardiologist due to carcinoid-induced heart failure. At 67 years old, the patient was referred to Kyoto University Hospital with a solitary mass 8 cm in diameter and located in the paraaortic area, which was detected by routine ultrasonography and subsequent computed tomography (CT) scans. Urinary 5-hydroxyindole acetate (5-HIAA), a serotonin degradation metabolite, was present at elevated levels. With a diagnosis of a recurrent carcinoid tumor, the patient underwent a tumor resection. The pathological diagnosis was that of lymph node metastasis of the trabecular carcinoid. Post-operatively, the 5-HIAA levels returned to normal. Carcinoid tumors occasionally recur following surgery due to borderline malignant potential. Due to the slow growing nature of these tumors, in specific cases, recurrence occurs following a long interval. Therefore, a relatively long follow-up period is required.
