In this study, we compared one hundred patients with autoimmune/inflammatory syndrome induced by adjuvants (ASIA) due to silicone implant incompatibility syndrome diagnosed in 2014 in Maastricht, the Netherlands, with one hundred historical patients with adjuvant breast disease diagnosed in the Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, USA, between 1985 and 1992. Similarities and differences between these two cohorts were identified to determine whether the spectrum of silicone-related disease changed during the last 30 years. Patients with complaints possibly due to silicone-filled breast implants were prospectively examined in the Reinaert Clinic, Maastricht, the Netherlands between January 2014 and October 2014. All patients were evaluated for the fulfilment of ASIA criteria. Results were compared to results of the Baylor College cohort and 18 other reviewed historical cohorts. Clinical manifestations between the Maastricht and Baylor College cohorts were comparable. Fatigue was observed in 98 current patients and in 95 historical patients. Arthralgia was observed in 91 versus 81 historical patients. Myalgia was observed in 54 versus 91 patients. Cognitive impairment was observed in 78 versus 81 patients, pyrexia was observed in 64 versus 52 patients, sicca complaints in 73 versus 72 patients and severe neurological manifestations in 20 versus 32 patients. From the 54 patients who underwent removal of their silicone breast implant, 50 % (
