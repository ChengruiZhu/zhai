Solid tumors following myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) are rare and have no uniform treatment guidelines. The current study presents a rare case of a 47-year-old female diagnosed with cervical cancer (International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics stage IIIB) with an eight-year history of MDS. A multidisciplinary treatment discussion was organized and a rigorous treatment plan was developed. With injection of granulocyte colony-stimulating factor and interleukin-11 factor, transfusion of red blood cell suspension and close monitoring of the blood count, the patient was administered radiotherapy, specifically intensity modulated radiation therapy. However, a degree IV bone marrow suppression repeatedly assaulted, leading to interruption of the radiotherapy treatment. Eventually, the total dose received by point A (2 cm above the cervical os marker and 2 cm perpendicular to the uterine axis along the plane of the uterus) was 51 Gy. One month later, a gynecological examination and magnetic resonance imaging of the pelvis revealed that the treatment resulted in a complete remission. In conclusion, radiation therapy can still be implemented to obtain satisfactory local control when the hematopoietic function of the bone marrow is weakened due to long-term MDS.
