Patients that present with multiple primary malignant neoplasms are increasingly encountered, but the treatment of such patients presents specific challenges and long-term survival is rare. The present study reports the case of a 45-year-old female diagnosed with three rare, distinct primary malignant neoplasms, including epithelioid hemangioendothelioma (EHE) of the brain, Ewing’s sarcoma of the lumbar 2 vertebra and a malignant solitary fibrous tumour (SFT) of the liver, at different time points. The patient underwent multidisciplinary treatment according to the diagnoses, including radial resection of all primary lesions, chemotherapy (consisting of vincristine, dactinomycin, cyclophosphamide and adriamycin) and radiotherapy, to treat Ewing’s sarcoma and metastases of EHE and malignant SFT. Following these treatments, the patient survived for >14 years. Multidisciplinary treatment regimens based on surgery can lead to long-term survival of patients with multiple asynchronous rare primary malignant neoplasms. The present study reported that multidisciplinary treatment regimens based on surgery can lead to the long-term survival of patients with multiple asynchronous rare primary malignant neoplasms.
