Human induced pluripotent stem (hiPS) cells are a potentially powerful model system for studying human disease and development, and a resource for personalized medicine. However, it has been reported that hiPS cells exhibit substantial heterogeneity which could limit their use as model systems. Clearly, knowledge of the source of heterogeneity is key for deeper understanding of the use of human iPS cells for basic and therapeutic applications. One source of this heterogeneity has been presumed to be “memory” of the adult somatic cell from which the hIPS cells were derived, but the evidence to support this view is scant. We have generated a set of human iPS cells from a set of somatic cell types from different donors. Our study shows that cell lines from different somatic sources but from the same donor (i.e. with the same genome) are more similar than cell lines isolated from the same tissue type but from different donors. Once genetic changes are accounted for, all aspects of gene expression, including mRNA levels, splicing and imprinting are highly similar between iPS cells derived from different human tissues. Thus, most of the previously described transcriptional variation between cell lines is likely to be genetic in origin.
