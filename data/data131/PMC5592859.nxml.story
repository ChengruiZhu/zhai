Stress associated endoplasmic reticulum protein 1 (SERP1), can cause accumulation of unfolded proteins in ER stress. However, studies on the role of SERP1 in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) are still incomplete. The present study aimed at identifying whether SERP1 acts as a potential novel prognostic marker of PDAC, and analyzed its possible mechanism. GEO database analysis showed SERP1 was significantly upregulated in PDAC tissues, and strongly associated with advanced clinical stage of PDAC patients from TCGA database. Univariate and multivariate Cox regression analysis further revealed SERP1 high expression was an independent factor for the prognosis of PDAC. Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) revealed that SERP1 was mainly involved in regulating cell apoptosis and nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) signaling pathway, and downregulated SERP1 significantly promoted PANC-1 cell apoptosis. To further explore its possible mechanism, protein-protein interaction (PPI) and gene ontology (GO) analysis showed the functions of proteins interacting with SERP1 were mainly enriched in regulating cell apoptosis, and SRP receptor β subunit (SRPRB) was the core of the whole PPI network. The expression of SERP1 was negatively correlated with SRPRB expression.
