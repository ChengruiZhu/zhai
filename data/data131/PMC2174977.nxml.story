Bacteria swim in relatively straight lines and change directions through tumbling. In the process of chemotaxis, a network of receptors and other proteins controls the tumbling frequency to direct an otherwise random walk toward nutrients and away from repellents. Receptor clustering and adaptation to persistent stimuli through covalent modification allow chemotaxis to be sensitive over a large range of ambient concentrations. The individual components of the chemotaxis network are well characterized, and signaling measurements by fluorescence microscopy quantify the network's response, making the system well suited for modeling and analysis. In this paper, we expand upon a previous model based on experiments indicating that the covalent modifications required for adaptation occur through the action of enzymes on groups of neighboring receptors, referred to as assistance neighborhoods. Simulations show that our proposed molecular model of a strongly coupled complex of receptors produces accurate responses to different stimuli and is robust to parameter variation. Within this model, the correct adaptation response is limited by small assistance-neighborhood size as well as enzyme kinetics. We also explore how these kinetics contribute to noise in the chemotactic response.
