Tissue engineering is a rapidly growing technological area for the regeneration and reconstruction of damage to the central nervous system. By combining seed cells with appropriate biomaterial scaffolds, tissue engineering has the ability to improve nerve regeneration and functional recovery. In the present study, mouse induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) were generated from mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) with the non-integrating episomal vectors pCEP4-EO2S-ET2K and pCEP4-miR-302-367 cluster, and differentiated into neural stem cells (NSCs) as transplanting cells. Electrospinning was then used to fabricate randomly oriented poly(L-lactic acid) (PLLA) nanofibers and aligned PLLA nanofibers and assessed their cytocompatibility and neurite guidance effect with iPSC-derived NSCs (iNSCs). The results demonstrated that non-integrated iPSCs were effectively generated and differentiated into iNSCs. PLLA nanofiber scaffolds were able to promote the adhesion, growth, survival and proliferation of the iNSCs. Furthermore, compared with randomly oriented PLLA nanofibers, the aligned PLLA nanofibers greatly directed neurite outgrowth from the iNSCs and significantly promoted neurite growth along the nanofibrous alignment. Overall, these findings indicate the feasibility of using PLLA nanofiber scaffolds in combination with iNSCs
