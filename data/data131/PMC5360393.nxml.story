Osteoporosis (OP) increases the risk of bone fractures and other complications, and is thus a major clinical problem. In this study, we examined the effect of isopsoralen on the differentiation of bone-derived marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs) into osteoblasts and adipocytes, as well as bone formation under osteoporotic conditions. Primary femoral BMSCs isolated from C57BL/6 mice were used to evaluate the isopsoralen-mediated regulation of the expression of alkaline phosphatase (ALP), osteocalcin (OCN) and runt-related transcription factor 2 (RUNX2) during osteogenesis 2 weeks. We also examined the expression of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPARγ) and CCAAT/enhancer binding protein β (C/EBPβ) under adipogenic conditions for 1 and 2 weeks. In addition, ovariectomized (OVX) mice were used to examine the effects of isopsoralen on bone formation for 2 months. Finally, mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) signaling was examined under osteogenic and adipogenic conditions. We found that following treatment with isopsoralen, the expression levels of ALP, OCN and RUNX2 were upregulated, whereas those of PPARγ and C/EBPβ were downregulated. mTORC1 signaling was also inhibited
