Physiological studies in humans and monkeys have revealed spatially organized waves of neuronal activity that propagate across the cortex during sensory or behavioral tasks. However the functional role of such waves remains elusive. In the present study, we use numerical simulation to investigate whether wave patterns may serve as a basis for neural coding in cortex. Specifically, we propose a theoretical dendritic mechanism which permits neurons to respond selectively to the morphological properties of waves. In this proposal, the arrangement of excitatory and inhibitory receptors within the dendritic receptor field constitutes a spatial filter of the incoming wave patterns. The proposed mechanism allows the neuron to discriminate waves based on wavelength and orientation, thereby providing a basis for neural decoding. We explore this concept in the context of the descending motor system where the pyramidal tract neurons of motor cortex monosynaptically innervate motor neurons in the spinal cord. Pyramidal tract neurons have broad dendritic fields which make them ideal candidates for spatial filters of waves in motor cortex. Our model demonstrates how wave patterns in motor cortex can be transformed into a descending motor drive which replicates some fundamental oscillatory properties of human motor physiology.
