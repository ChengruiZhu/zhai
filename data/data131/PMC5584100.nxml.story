The purpose of this study is to understand if there is any alteration in the posture of patients affected by organic dysphonia and describe possible postural modifications after phonomicrosurgery on the vocal folds. Forty subjects (22 males, 18 females; mean age 32.6 Â± 7.5 years) suffering from organic dysphonia (15 cases of polyps, 11 submucosal retention cysts, 10 bilateral fibrous vocal fold nodules and 4 bilateral Reinke's oedema) were examined by open-eye and closed-eye posturography while breathing spontaneously before surgery, 24 hours after surgery and after 6 months. The variables taken into account were: the coordinates of the centre of pressure on both frontal and sagittal planes, length and surface of the track, mean velocity of the oscillations and relative standard deviations, spectral analysis of oscillation frequency, statokinesigram and stabilogram values. No characteristic pathological pattern was seen in basal stabilometry in any of the subgroups (polyps, cysts, Reinke's oedema). Only the subgroup of patients with fibrous vocal fold nodules (8/10; 80%) showed a slight forward shift from the centre of gravity when analysed in both open-eye and closed-eye posturography. A comparison performed within the same subgroup using open-eye and closed-eye posturography before and after surgery revealed no significant difference in any of the parameters being studied. The use of static stabilometry in this study demonstrates the absence of characteristic postural alterations in patients affected by organic dysphonia and also excludes that simple removal of the vocal fold lesion can change posture.
