There is controversy concerning the mechanisms by which the axonal microtubule (MT) array is elaborated, with some models focusing on MT assembly and other models focusing on MT transport. We have proposed a composite model in which MT assembly and transport are both important (Joshi, H.C., and P.W. Baas. 1993. J. Cell Biol. 121:1191-1196). In the present study, we have taken a novel approach to evaluate the merits of this proposal. Biotinylated tubulin was microinjected into cultured neurons that had already grown short axons. The axons were then permitted to grow longer, after which the cells were prepared for immunoelectron microscopic analyses. We reasoned that any polymer that assembled or turned over subunits after the introduction of the probe should label for biotin, while any polymer that was already assembled but did not turnover should not label. Therefore, the presence in the newly grown region of the axon of any unlabeled MT polymer is indicative of MT transport. In sampled regions, the majority of the polymer was labeled, indicating that MT assembly events are active during axon growth. Varying amounts of unlabeled polymer were also present in the newly grown regions, indicating that MT transport also occurs. Together these findings demonstrate that MT assembly and transport both contribute to the elaboration of the axonal MT array.
