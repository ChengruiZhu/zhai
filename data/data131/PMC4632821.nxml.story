Inflammatory responses are frequently associated with the expression of inflammatory cytokines and severe osteoclastogenesis, which significantly affect the efficacy of biomaterials. Recent findings have suggested that interferon (IFN)-γ and zoledronate (Zol) are effective inhibitors of osteoclastogenesis. However, little is known regarding the utility of IFN-γ and Zol in bone tissue engineering. In this study, we generated rat models by generating critically sized defects in calvarias implanted with an alpha-tricalcium phosphate/collagen sponge (α-TCP/CS). At four weeks post-implantation, the rats were divided into IFN-γ, Zol, and control (no treatment) groups. Compared with the control group, the IFN-γ and Zol groups showed remarkable attenuation of severe osteoclastogenesis, leading to a significant enhancement in bone mass. Histomorphometric data and mRNA expression patterns in IFN-γ and Zol-injected rats reflected high bone-turnover with increased bone formation, a reduction in osteoclast numbers, and tumor necrosis factor-α expression. Our results demonstrated that the administration of IFN-γ and Zol enhanced bone regeneration of α-TCP/CS implants by enhancing bone formation, while hampering excess bone resorption.
