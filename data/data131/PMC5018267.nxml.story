Piroxicam has two different crystalline forms (known as needle and cubic forms), that they are different in physicochemical properties such as biological solubility. In the current research, using Taguchi experimental design approach the influences of five operating variables on formation of the piroxicam polymorph shapes in recrystallization were studied. The variables include type of solvent, cooling methods, type of mixture paddle, pH, and agitator speed. Statistical analysis of results revealed the significance order of factors affecting the product quality and quantity. At first using the Taguchi experimental method, the influence of process factors on the yield, particle size and dissolution rate of piroxicam powder was statistically investigated. The optimum conditions to achieve the best dissolution rate of piroxicam were determined experimentally. The results were analyzed using Qualitek4 software and it was revealed that the type of solvent and method of cooling respectively are the most important factors that affect the dissolution rate. It was also experimentally achieved that some factors such as type of agitator paddle, pH and agitation rate have no significant effects on dissolution rate.
