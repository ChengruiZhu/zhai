10 fresh-frozen matched cadaveric pairs of elbows were used in this study. The distal biceps tendon was isolated and 3 centimeters of tendon was resected. In Group 1, the LF was identified and released from its distal attachment, maintaining its attachment to the biceps muscle. This was then tubularized and repaired to the radius via button fixation. In Group 2, an AA tendon graft was sutured to the biceps muscle via Pulvertaft weave and similarly repaired to the ulna via button fixation. The prepared radii were rigidly mounted at a 45-degree angle in a MTS electromechanical test frame (MTS Systems, Eden Prairie, MN). The proximal biceps muscle was secured in a custom fabricated cryogenic grip and allowed to freeze for 60s prior to testing. Two differential variable reluctance transducers (DVRTs) were mounted on the specimens, one at the radius-soft tissue junction and the second in the muscle or muscle allograft tissue junction proximal to the repair. Specimens were then loaded at a displacement rate of 20 mm/min until failure. Failure was defined as a 3 mm displacement of the DVRT located at the radius-soft tissue junction. Stiffness was calculated from the initial linear portion of the load versus radial DVRT curve. A t-test was used to determine if any observed differences were significant (pâ‰¤0.05)
