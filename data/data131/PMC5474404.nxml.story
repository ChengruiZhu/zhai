Compressive syndromes of the radial nerve have different presentations. There is no consensus on diagnostic and therapeutic methods. The aim of this review is to summarize such methods. Eletronic searches related terms, held in databases (1980-2016): Pubmed (via Medline), Lilacs (via Scielo) and Google Scholar. Through pre-defined protocol, we identified relevant studies. We excluded case reports. Aspects of diagnosis and treatment were synthesized for analysis and tables. Quantitative analyzes were followed by their dispersion variables. Fourteen studies were included. All studies were considered as level IV evidence. Most studies consider aspects of clinical history and provocative maneuvers. There is no consensus on the use of electromyography, and methods are heterogeneous. Studies have shown that surgical treatment (muscle release and neurolysis) has variable success rate, ranging from 20 to 96.5%. Some studies applied self reported scores, though the heterogeneity of the population does not allow inferential analyzes on the subject. few complications reported. Most studies consider the diagnosis of compressive radial nerve syndromes essentially clinical. The most common treatment was combined muscle release and neurolysis, with heterogeneous results. There is a need for comparative studies
