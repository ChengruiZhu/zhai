Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a systemic autoimmune disorder with involvement of multiple organs. Various forms of serositis, including pleural effusion, pericardial effusion, and ascites, may be found during the course of SLE. Peritoneal involvement by ascites is common in the initial presentation of SLE. However, chylous ascites is uncommon in SLE patients. Here, we describe a 93-year-old female with initial presentation of chylous ascites during SLE flares. Marked distention and an ovoid shape of the abdomen were observed. Shifting dullness and central tympanic sounds were found on percussion. Rales were heard in bilateral breathing sounds, multiple oral ulcers appeared in the oral cavity, and chest images showed bilateral pleural effusion. Abdominal sonography revealed moderate ascites and pleural effusion. Neither organisms nor malignant cells were revealed in the culture or cytology of ascites and pleural effusion. The diagnosis of SLE was arrived at by positive antinuclear antibody (ANA), discoid rash, oral ulcers, serositis (pleural effusion and ascites), and proteinuria. The patient received intravenous methylprednisolone 250â€‰mg/day for three days. The pleural effusion resolved dramatically after steroid therapy and abdominal distention related to ascites formation subsided obviously.
