Like traffic on highways, molecular cargos are transported within cells on tracks that are collectively referred to as cytoskeletal networks. RNA molecules are one such cargo, and in many species, the localization of RNAs in egg cells or oocytes is essential for establishing the first asymmetries that are necessary for proper embryo development. RNAs can be actively transported by molecular motors that move cargos along the cytoskeletal tracks, but how such motors are capable of directing cargos to specific destinations within the cell is not yet known. Here we show that two motors, dynein and kinesin—known to carry out transport in opposite directions—are both directly involved in RNA localization in frog oocytes. To understand how these motors can promote directional cargo transport, we developed a system to monitor RNA transport in live oocytes. We find that the motor acting first in the pathway, dynein, is responsible for unidirectional transport. Bidirectional transport, mediated by kinesin, occurs subsequently on cytoskeletal tracks of opposing polarity near the RNA's final destination. Our results suggest a new model for directional transport comprising an initial directional cue that dominates over a later nondirectional step, acting to refine the ultimate cargo distribution.
