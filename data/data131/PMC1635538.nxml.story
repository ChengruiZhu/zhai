Adaptive immunity is a response of the immune system that involves the activation of lymphocytes and that is most effective in defending against virus-infected cells, cancer cells, fungi, and intracellular bacteria. Central to this response is the interaction between a T cell and an antigen-presenting cell, and in particular the communication of information mediated by the T cell receptor and co-receptors. The contact zone between the cells is a highly organized interface, which is termed the immunological synapse, where both the spatial and the temporal organization of the bound receptors contribute to the generated activation signal on antigen recognition. Although a considerable amount of experimental and theoretical studies have dealt with the immunological synapse, the mechanisms that control its formation are still under discussion. In 2005, Mossman et al. conducted ingenious experiments using nanometer-scale structures to geometrically repattern the immunological synapse. These experiments are reproduced by Figge and Meyer-Hermann applying computer simulations, based on an agent-based model approach, to uncover the emerging structures as well as the underlying formation mechanisms. Clear predictions for the structure of proposed geometrically repatterned immunological synapses are obtained that will further elucidate the role of the involved formation mechanisms.
