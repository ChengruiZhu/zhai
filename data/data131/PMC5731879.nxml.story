We investigated the mechanisms by which microRNA (miR)-182 promotes apoptosis and inhibits proliferation in human osteosarcoma (OS) cells. Levels of miR-182 and Homeobox A9 (HOXA9) expression were compared between human OS and normal cells. Subjects were divided into OS and normal groups. We analyzed the target relationship of miR-182 and Homeobox A9 (HOXA9). Cells were then assigned into blank, negative control, miR-182 mimics, miR-182 inhibitors, siRNA-HOXA9, or and miR-182 inhibitors + siRNA-HOXA9 groups. Cell function was assayed by CCK-8, flow cytometry and wound healing assay. Additionally, we analyzed OS tumor growth in a xenograft mouse model. Dual-luciferase reporter assays indicated miR-182 directly targets HOXA9. Reverse transcription quantitative PCR and western blotting revealed elevated expression of miR-182, WIF-1, BIM, and Bax, and reduced expression of HOXA9, Wnt, β-catenin, Survivin, Cyclin D1, c-Myc, Mcl-1, Bcl-xL, and Snail in osteosarcoma cells treated with miR-182 mimic or siRNA-HOXA9 as compared to controls. Osteosarcoma cells also exhibited decreased cell proliferation, migration, and tumor growth, and increased apoptosis when treated with miR-182 mimic or siRNA-HOXA9. Correspondingly, in a xenograft mouse model, osteosarcoma tumor volume and growth were increased when cells were treated with miR-182 inhibitor and decreased by miR-182 mimic or siRNA-HOXA9. These results indicate that miR-182 downregulates Wnt/β-catenin signaling, inhibits cell proliferation, and promotes apoptosis in osteosarcoma cells by suppressing HOXA9 expression.
