The cardioprotective effects of adenosine and adenosine receptor agonists have been studied extensively. However, their therapeutic outcomes in ischemic heart disease are limited by systemic side effects such as hypotension, bradycardia, and sedation. Equilibrative nucleoside transporter (ENT) inhibitors may be an alternative. By reducing the uptake of extracellular adenosine, ENT1 inhibitors potentiate the cardioprotective effect of endogenous adenosine. They have fewer systemic side effects because they selectively increase the extracellular adenosine levels in ischemic tissues undergoing accelerated adenosine formation. Nonetheless, long-term inhibition of ENT1 may adversely affect tissues that have low capacity for de novo nucleotide biosynthesis. ENT1 inhibitors may also affect the cellular transport, and hence the efficacy, of anticancer and antiviral nucleoside analogs used in chemotherapy. It has been proposed that ENT4 may also contribute to the regulation of extracellular adenosine in the heart, especially under the acidotic conditions associated with ischemia. Like ENT1 inhibitors, ENT4 inhibitors should work specifically on ischemic tissues. Theoretically, ENT4 inhibitors do not affect tissues that rely on ENT1 for de novo nucleotide synthesis. They also have no interaction with anticancer and antiviral nucleosides. Development of specific ENT4 inhibitors may open a new avenue in research on ischemic heart disease therapy.
