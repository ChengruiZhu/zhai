Molecular evolution studies have shown that the redundancy intrinsic to gene duplication may allow one gene duplicate to acquire a new function (neofunctionalization) or for both duplicates to each assume a subset of the ancestral gene's functions (subfunctionalization). Studies of networks of interacting proteins and models of evolving protein interaction networks have shown that both subfunctionalization and neofunctionalization are widespread in protein evolution. Here, we present evidence that shows that the methods and models that have established neofunctionalization as a ubiquitous force in protein interaction network evolution are flawed and under reexamination support subfunctionalization, not neofunctionalization. We start by reviewing the methods and models that engender prolific subfunctionalization and neofunctionalization in evolution. We then critically approach neofunctionalization. We show that biases in protein interaction assays, failure to consider concurrent and subsequent gene duplications in evolutionary inferences, and an inability of theoretical models to reproduce empirical clustering have all led to neofunctionalization being erroneously identified as a pervasive force in evolution.
