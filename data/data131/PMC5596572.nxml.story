 effects of CDDO-imidazole (CDDO-Im) (1-[2-cyano-3-,12-dioxooleana-1,9(11)-dien-28-oyl] imidazole), a Nrf2 activator, in hepatic I/R injury is lacking and its exact molecular mechanisms are still not very clear. The goals of this study were to determine whether CDDO-Im can prevent liver injury induced by I/R in the mouse, and to elucidate the molecular target of drug action. Mice were randomly equally divided into two groups and administered intraperitoneally with either DMSO control or CDDO-Im (2 mg/kg) 3 h before subjected to 90-min hepatic 70% ischemia followed by reperfusion. Subsequently, the Liver and blood samples of these mice were collected to evaluate liver injury. CDDO-Im pretreatment markedly improve hepatic I/R injury by attenuating hepatic necrosis and apoptosis, reducing reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels and inflammatory responses, and ameliorating mitochondrial dysfunction. Mechanistically, by using Nrf2 Knockout mice and hemeoxygenase 1 (HO-1) inhibitor, we found that these CDDO-Im protection effects are attributed to enhanced autophagy, which is mediated by activating Nrf2/HO-1 pathway. By accelerating autophagy and clearance of damaged mitochondria, CDDO-Im reduced the mtDNA release and ROS overproduction, and in turn decreased damage-associated molecular patterns induced inflammatory responses and the following secondary liver injury. These results indicate that by enhancing autophagy, CDDO-Im-mediated activation of Nrf2/HO-1 signaling could be a novel therapeutic strategy to minimize the adverse effects of hepatic I/R injury.
