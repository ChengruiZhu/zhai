The RAS-MAPK pathway plays a central role in the development of multicellular organisms, predominantly by regulating cell proliferation and differentiation. At its core, the pathway includes the RAS GTPase and three kinases (RAF, MEK, and MAPK) that transmit RAS signals through a phosphorylation cascade. Several factors have been discovered over the years that modulate signal transmission by altering the kinetics of phosphorylation/dephosphorylation of the core pathway components. In contrast, scant information is available on the mechanisms governing their expression and steady-state levels. Here, we report the characterization of a deubiquitinase (DUB) known as USP47, which stabilizes MAPK protein levels by opposing the activity of the proteasome, which is a major protein degradation machinery in eukaryotic cells. A search for enzymes that opposed USP47 activity identified several components of the N-end rule pathway centered on the poorly characterized POE/UBR4 E3 ligase. These components appear to work together to target MAPK for proteasome-mediated protein degradation and thereby reduce MAPK protein half-life. Together, this work identifies a new means by which RAS-MAPK signaling output is controlled in
