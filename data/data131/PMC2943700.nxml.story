O). In this observational study, we studied the trend amongst anaesthesiologist in choosing the type of ETT and their ability to assess optimum ICP clinically. After institutional ethics committee approval, we observed 75 patients under general endotracheal anaesthesia in Government Medical College. Anaesthesiologists were blinded to study purpose. The type of ETT used and magnitude of ICP was recorded. ICP was measured using simple aneroid manometer. Once the pressure was measured, it was readjusted to normal range and nitrous oxide was allowed to start. Red rubber tube was used in 18.7% and polyvinyl chloride (PVC) in 81.3% cases. The anaesthesiologists were not able to assess ICP in the recommended range clinically in 100% cases when red rubber ETT was used and in 40% cases when portex ETT was used. Red rubber ETT (reusable) with low-volume high-pressure cuff is still in use, though the trend is shifting towards more of using PVC ETT. Anaesthesiologists were not able to inflate the ETT cuff to the recommended range in spite of their clinical expertise (more than 5 years of teaching experience) in significant number of cases. We recommend the use of simple aneroid manometer for objective monitoring of ICP over subjective assessment, not only in red rubber, but also in PVC ETT.
