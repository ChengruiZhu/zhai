Protein copy numbers are often found to be stoichiometrically balanced for subunits of multi-protein complexes. Imbalance is believed to be deleterious because it lowers complex yield (the dosage balance hypothesis) and increases the risk of misinteractions, but imbalance may also provide unexplored functional benefits. We show here that the benefits of stoichiometric balance can extend to larger networks of interacting proteins. We develop a method to quantify to what degree protein networks are balanced, and apply it to two networks. We find that the clathrin-mediated endocytosis system in yeast is statistically balanced, but not perfectly so, and explore the consequences of imbalance in the form of misinteractions and endocytic function. We also show that biological networks are more robust to misinteractions than random networks when balanced, but are more sensitive to misinteractions under imbalance. This suggests evolutionary pressure for proteins to be balanced and that any conserved imbalance should occur for functional reasons. We explore one such reason in the form of bottlenecking the endocytosis process. Our method can be generalized to other networks and used to identify out-of-balance proteins. Our results provide insight into how network design, expression level regulation, and cell fitness are intertwined.
