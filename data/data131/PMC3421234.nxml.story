In the present study, an equilibrated system for the Aqy1 tetramer was developed, and molecular biophysics modeling showed that the Aqy1 channel was blocked by Tyr-31 in the N-terminus, which was also supported by the free energy profiles. However, bioinformatics analysis of the amino acid sequence of Aqy1 indicated this Tyr-31 is not conserved across all fungi. Analysis of the equilibrated structure showed that the central pore along the four-fold axis of the tetramers is formed with hydrophobic amino acid residues. In particular, Phe-90, Trp-198, and Phe-202 form the narrowest part of the pore. Therefore, water molecules are not expected to translocate through the central pore, a hypothesis that we confirmed by molecular dynamics simulations. Each monomer of the Aqy1 tetramers forms a channel whose walls consist mostly of hydrophilic residues, transporting through the selectivity filter containing Arg-227, His-212, Phe-92, and Ala-221, and the two conserved Asn-Pro-Ala (NPA) motifs containing asparagines 224 and 112. In summary, not all fungal aquaporins share the same gating mechanism by a tyrosine residue in the N-terminus, and the structural analysis in the present study should aid our understanding of aquaporin structure and its functional implications.
