There were 176 males (39.6%) classified as never smokers, 169 (38.1%) as prior smokers, and 99 (22.3%) as current smokers. The median follow-up was 76 months (range nine-146) and 61.9% of patients were African American. The eight-year BFFS for never smokers, prior smokers and current smokers was 73.6%, 80.2%, and 73.4% respectively, p=0.38. Similarly, the eight-year DMFS was 92.8%, 96.8%, and 95.3% respectively, p=0.54. On multivariate analysis, prior smoking (HR 0.72, p=0.19) and current smoking (HR 1.02, p=0.93) were not associated with increased biochemical failure. Similarly, smoking use was not associated with increased distant metastatic disease (hormone receptor (HR) 0.71, p=0.51 for prior smokers, HR 1.41, p=0.52 for current smokers). The presence of intermediate-risk disease (HR 2.87, p=0.002) was associated with an increased likelihood of biochemical failure. The high-risk disease was associated with both a higher risk of biochemical failure (HR 8.02, p <0.001) as well as distant metastatic disease (HR 17.61, p=0.01). On multivariate regression, prior or current smoking use was not associated with an increased likelihood of late grade two genitourinary or gastrointestinal toxicity.
