In most vertebrates, an early event in egg development involves the establishment of the so-called animal—vegetal axis; this sets up the embryonic body axes and contributes to germ-line specification, and therefore, is key to embryonic development. The animal—vegetal axis is established during oogenesis by the Balbiani body (Bb), an aggregate of specific mRNAs, proteins, and mitochondria, which forms adjacent to the nucleus and ultimately defines one pole of the oocyte, the vegetal pole. Despite its universal conservation, how the Bb forms and how its position is determined is unknown. Here, we show that Bb formation is initiated at the onset of meiosis, and its position coincides with a previously known meiotic polarized nuclear configuration, the chromosomal bouquet, which gathers the chromosome ends, the telomeres, asymmetrically on the nuclear membrane to assist in homologous chromosome pairing. We reveal that a global cellular organizer functioning via microtubules generates the bouquet and aggregates the Bb precursors asymmetrically towards the centrosome. We determined that these events lie functionally upstream to the Bb regulator Bucky ball. Further upstream, we found that the centrosome appears prepositioned by an intercellular cytoplasmic bridge derived from the last presumptive cell division plane of the premeiotic oogonial cell. Thus, oocyte polarity and the chromosomal bouquet are linked through a common cellular polarization mechanism.
