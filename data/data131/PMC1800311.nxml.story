The authors systematically searched the published medical literature to find all randomized, blinded drug trials published in just one year (2004) in a number of different “high-impact” journals (well-regarded journals whose articles are often mentioned in other articles). Then, they classified information from the published trial reports. They ended up with 145 trial reports, of which 123 described how blinding was done. The trials covered a wide range of medical conditions and types of treatment. The blinding methods used mainly involved the use of “sham” procedures. Thus, in 80% of the studies in which the treatment involved a medical device, a pretend device had been used to make patients in the control group think they were receiving treatment. In many of the treatments involving surgery, researchers had devised elaborate ways of making patients think they had had an operation. When the treatment involved manipulation (e.g. physiotherapy or chiropractic), fake “hands-on” techniques were given to the control patients. The authors of this systematic review classify all the other techniques that were used to blind both the patients and members of the research teams. They found that some highly innovative ideas have been successfully put into practice.
