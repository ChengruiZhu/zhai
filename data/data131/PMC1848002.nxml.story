Cellular networks are at the heart of systems biology at present. To understand how cellular networks function in these highly fluctuating environments, a global approach is needed. Here we provide a global framework, in terms of potential landscapes, for studying the gene regulatory networks in the presence of the intrinsic statistical fluctuations. We uncovered the underlying landscape for the network. We identified the basins of attraction of the landscape as the biological functional states. The potential barrier between the two basins determines the time scale of conversion from one to the other. The robustness of the biological functional states of the network, the gene switches in this case, can be guaranteed if the conversions among the basins of attraction are not frequent, or, in other words, the barriers among the basins are relatively large. More detailed features of the network, such as the key genes or regulating links relevant to diseases (i.e., cancers), can be uncovered from the underlying landscape. Our technique is general and can be applied to explore the potential landscape of more realistic gene networks. Furthermore, our approach can also be helpful in guiding the network optimal design for synthetic biology.
