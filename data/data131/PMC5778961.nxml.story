We included all new nonfatal stroke events in 2006–2008 from population‐based hospital registers in Sweden among women and men aged 25 to 60 years (n=12 972). Annual days of diagnosis‐specific work disability were followed for 4 years before and after stroke. Repeated measures negative binomial regression models using the generalized estimating equations method were fitted to examine trends in diagnosis‐specific work disability before and after the event. Already during the 4 pre‐event years, work disability attributed to circulatory diseases increased among women (rate ratio, 1.99; 95% confidence interval, 1.68–2.36) and men (rate ratio, 2.20; 95% confidence interval, 1.88–2.57). Increasing trends before stroke were also found for work disability attributed to mental disorders, musculoskeletal diseases, neoplasms, diseases of the nervous, respiratory, and digestive systems, injuries, and diabetes mellitus. As expected, a sharp increase in work disability days attributed to circulatory diseases was found during the first year after the event among both sexes. Overall, during 4 years after the stroke, there was a decreasing trend for circulatory diseases and injuries, whereas the trend was increasing for nervous diseases and diabetes mellitus.
