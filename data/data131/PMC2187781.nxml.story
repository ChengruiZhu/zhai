The GL183 mAb was obtained by immunizing BALB/c mice with the E57 clone (CD7+CD2+CD3-CD16+CD56+) derived from human peripheral blood NK cells. In human peripheral blood, GL183-reactive cells ranged between 2 and 12% (mean 6.5%) in 10 different donors. Double fluorescence and FACS analysis showed that GL183+ cells were consistently included in the CD56+ or CD16+ cell populations. Moreover, since only a fraction of CD56+ or CD16+ cells (approximately 40%) coexpressed GL183 surface antigen, reactivity with GL183 mAb appears to define two subsets within the CD3- lymphocyte population expressing NK cell markers. Although, the majority of GL183+ cells were CD3-, approximately 1% expressed CD3 surface antigens. As shown by clonal analysis, these infrequent CD3+GL183+ cells coexpressed CD56 and CD16 antigens. Cloning of CD3- GL183+ or CD3-GL183- cell populations under limiting dilution conditions yielded clonal progenies that maintained their original surface phenotype. Therefore, expression or lack of expression of GL183 surface antigens represents a stable phenotypic property of a subset of human CD3- NK cells. Immunoprecipitation experiments and two- dimensional PAGE analysis indicated that GL183-reactive molecules were represented in different clones either by a single 58-kD chain or, more frequently, by two chains of approximately 55 and approximately 58 kD, respectively. Analysis of GL183+ or GL183- NK clones for their ability to lyse human (IGROV I) or murine (P815) tumor target cells indicated that GL183- clones were, on average, fivefold more efficient in inducing target cell lysis. GL183+ and GL183- clones produced comparable levels of TNF-alpha in response to PHA plus PMA or anti-CD16 mAb plus PMA. Importantly, production of TNF-alpha was also induced by stimulation of GL183+ clones with GL183 mAb plus PMA. These data indicated that GL183 antigen could mediate cell triggering. This concept was confirmed by the analysis of Ca2+ mobilization, as GL183 mAb induced (in GL183+ clones) increments of [Ca2+]i comparable with those induced by PHA. Moreover, GL183 mAb, or its F(ab')2 fragments, strongly enhanced the cytolytic activity of GL183+ clones against a panel of human tumor target cells, including U937, Raji, IGROV I, M14, and A549. In contrast, GL183 mAb, but not the F(ab')2 fragments, sharply inhibited the cytolytic activity of the same clones against P815, M12, and P3U1 murine target cells. In this case, the effect of GL183 mAb (inhibition) was opposite that of PHA or of stimulatory anti- CD2 or anti-CD16 mAbs, which consistently enhanced the target cell lysis.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)
