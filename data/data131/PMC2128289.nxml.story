. causing mild infection with recovery in the majority of animals, and in still others the animals were injected with at least 50 minimum lethal doses of a mixture of a culture and a highly virulent organ emulsion from a guinea pig. The animals were inoculated intraperitoneally, and within about 30 minutes each was injected subcutaneously with a different amount of salvarsan or neosalvarsan. The amounts injected were in most series 0.0005, 0.001, 0.002, 0.005, 0.01, 0.02, and 0.03 gm. per 350 to 450 gm. of body weight, and in one series, in addition to this dosage, 0.00005,0.0001, and 0.0002 gm. were also tried. Among the guinea pigs treated either with salvarsan or with neosalvarsan there were more recoveries than among the controls, but they were not in strict proportion to the amounts of the drugs injected. In the experiments with 50 minimum lethal doses of the infecting material there were several recoveries among those which received 0.001 to 0.002 to 0.003 gm., but all passed through a typical infection with all its symptoms. It is extremely doubtful, therefore, whether salvarsan or neosalvarsan mitigated the severity of the infection. The fact is noteworthy that in the same series of experiments the guinea pigs receiving 0.00005 and 0.0001 gm., or thereabout, of salvarsan died 1 to 2 days sooner than the controls, which died in 6 to 7 days. This suggests a possible earlier injury of the kidneys by the drugs, giving the leptospiras an easier and earlier access to, and localization in this organ. The inefficacy or dubious therapeutic value of salvarsan and neosalvarsan against the experimental
