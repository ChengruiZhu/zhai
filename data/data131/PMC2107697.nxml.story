 The carotid bodies from control, reserpine-treated, and hypoxia-treated hamsters were fixed with phosphate-buffered glutaraldehyde and osmium tetroxide, s-Collidine-buffered osmium tetroxide, or phosphate-buffered glutaraldehyde followed by potassium dichromate incubation. Following glutaraldehyde-osmium tetroxide fixation no differences in density or population of the electron-opaque granules in the glomus cells of either control or experimental animals were observed. With s-Collidine-buffered osmium tetroxide and the glutaraldehyde-dichromate technique a marked decrease in density without an appreciable reduction in number of granules was noted after reserpine treatment, while in hypoxia-treated hamsters the density and population of the granules were not different from those of the controls. The results indicate that reserpine depletes the amines without granule disappearance and that hypoxia does not affect the amine content of the granules. It is suggested that following glutaraldehyde-osmium tetroxide double fixation, persistence of the density of the granules in reserpine-treated animals is due primarily to the nonamine content, and that the amines in the glomus cells are probably not directly involved in the respiratory reflex.
