Aquaporin (AQP) is suggested to be regulated by leptin through the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/Akt/mammalian target of rapamycin pathway. AQP7 and AQP9 are membrane proteins with water and glycerol channels, the latter of which is essential for triglyceride synthesis. We conjectured that the expression of AQP7 and AQP9 would be altered in the skeletal myofibers in obese leptin deficient ob/ob mice as compared with that of wild mice. RNA and protein levels were studied in the quadriceps femoris muscles of ob/ob and wild mice. Real time quantitative RT-PCR analysis showed that mouse AQP7 mRNA levels in skeletal muscles were significantly higher in ob/ob mice than in wild mice (P<0.01), whereas mouse AQP9 mRNA level was not different between the two groups (P>0.05). Histologically the type 1 myofibers of ob/ob mice contained numerous lipid droplets in oil red O stain samples. Immunohistochemical staining of ob/ob mouse muscles revealed enhanced expression of AQP7 at myofiber surface membranes, while AQP9 expression appeared to be similar to that of wild mice. The findings suggest that the upregulated expression of AQP7 in ob/ob mouse muscles facilitates the secretion of glycerol from myocytes.
