Regulation of the cAMP-activated apical membrane Cl- conductance (GaCl) in Necturus gallbladder (NGB) epithelial cells was investigated with intracellular-microelectrode techniques. GaCl was increased by exposure to 8-Br-cAMP, theophylline or forskolin. Neither 8-Br-cGMP nor elevation of intracellular [Ca2+] using ionomycin had effects on GaCl or interfered with activation of GaCl by forskolin. N-(2- [methylamino]ethyl)-5-isoquinolinesulfonamide (H8), an inhibitor of cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA), slowed but did not prevent the GaCl response to 8-Br-cAMP. Phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA), which activates protein kinase C (PKC), stimulated GaCl but had no effects on intracellular [cAMP]. GaCl was unaffected by 4 alpha- phorbol, a PMA analog which does not activate PKC. Okadaic acid (OA), an inhibitor of protein phosphatases (PP) types 1 and 2A, slowed the activation of GaCl by 8-Br-cAMP, hastened the return of GaCl to basal values following removal of 8-Br-cAMP, and significantly reduced the elevation in intracellular [cAMP] produced by forskolin. OA had no effects on the GaCl changes elicited by theophylline. We conclude that: (a) NGB GaCl can be activated by PKA-mediated phosphorylation of apical membrane Cl- channels or a regulatory protein, (b) GaCl can also be activated via PKC, by a cAMP-independent mechanism, (c) OA-sensitive PP are not required for inactivation of GaCl; OA appears to stimulate phosphodiesterase, which lowers intracellular [cAMP] and affects GaCl activation, and (d) the apical membrane of NGB epithelium lacks a Ca(2+)-activated Cl- conductance.
