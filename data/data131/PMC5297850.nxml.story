][1,3]dioxol-5-yloxy)acetamide, referred to as KCH-1521. KCH-1521 was determined to bind talin and modulate downstream signaling molecules of talin. After 24 h of treatment, KCH-1521 changed the cell morphology of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) and reduced focal adhesion protein expression including vinculin and paxillin. Talin downstream signaling is regulated via focal adhesion kinase (FAK), kinase B (AKT), and extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) pathways, however, treatment with KCH-1521 decreased phosphorylation of FAK, AKT, and ERK, leading to reduction of cell proliferation, survival, and angiogenesis. Interestingly, the expression of various angiogenic genes was significantly decreased after treatment with KCH-1521. Also, in vitro tube forming assay revealed that KCH-1521 reduced angiogenic networks in a time-dependent manner. To investigate the reversibility of its effects, KCH-1521 was removed after treatment. HUVECs recovered their morphology through rearrangement of the cytoskeleton and the expression of angiogenic genes was also recovered. By further optimization and in vivo studies of KCH-1521, a novel drug of talin modulation could be used to achieve therapeutic anti-angiogenesis for vascular diseases and cancers.
