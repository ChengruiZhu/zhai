 studies, different groups proposed that the exchange of substrate receptors is mediated by a protein exchange factor named Cand1. Here, we have performed mathematical modeling to provide a quantitative underpinning of this hypothesis. First we show that the exchange activity of Cand1 necessarily leads to a trade-off between high ligase activity and fast receptor exchange. Supported by measurements we argue that this trade-off yields an optimal Cand1 concentration in cells where the time scale for substrate degradation becomes minimal. In a second step we show through simulations that (i) substrates bias the CRL repertoire leading to preferential assembly of ligases for which substrates are available and (ii) differences in binding affinities or substrate receptor abundances create a temporal hierarchy for the degradation of substrates. Finally, we compare the Cand1-mediated exchange cycle with an alternative architecture lacking Cand1 which indicates superiority of a system with exchange factor if substrate receptors bind substrates and the cullin scaffold in a random order. Together, our results provide general constraints for the operating regimes of molecular exchange systems and suggest that Cand1 endows the CRL network with the properties of an “on demand” system allowing cells to dynamically adjust their CRL repertoire to fluctuating substrate abundances.
