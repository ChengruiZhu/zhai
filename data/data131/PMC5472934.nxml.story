Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a pathologic condition frequently observed in clinical practice. To date, the prevalence of NAFLD is approximately 25–30% among adults of the general population in Western countries but increases to approximately 70–75% among patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. In the last decade, accumulating evidence has clearly demonstrated that patients with NAFLD have not only an increased liver-related morbidity and mortality but also an increased risk of fatal and non-fatal cardiovascular events. In particular, several studies have documented the existence of an independent association among NAFLD and cardiac changes in structure and function in both non-diabetic and diabetic patients. In addition, mounting evidence also suggests that there is a strong relationship between NAFLD and cardiac arrhythmias, such as atrial fibrillation, QTc prolongation and ventricular arrhythmias. This is of clinical interest, as it could explain, at least in part, the increased risk of death for cardiovascular disease in patients with NAFLD. Therefore, seeing that cardiovascular disease complications are the leading cause of disability and death in NAFLD patients, the recent European clinical practice guidelines advised to check the cardiovascular system in all patients with NAFLD. This clinical mini review will briefly describe the increasing body of evidence regarding the association between NAFLD and cardiac arrhythmias, and discuss the potential biological mechanisms underlying this association.
