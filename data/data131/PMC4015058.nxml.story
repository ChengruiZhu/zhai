Preventing breast cancer is an effective strategy for reducing breast cancer deaths. The purpose of chemoprevention (also termed preventive therapy) is to reduce cancer incidence by use of natural, synthetic, or biological agents. The efficacy of tamoxifen, raloxifene, and exemestane as preventive therapy against estrogen-receptor (ER)-positive breast cancer is well established for women at increased risk for breast cancer. However, because breast cancer is a heterogeneous disease, distinct preventive approaches may be required for effective prevention of each subtype. Current research is, therefore, focused on identifying alternative mechanisms by which biologically active compounds can reduce the risk of all breast cancer subtypes including ER-negative breast cancer. Promising agents are currently being developed for prevention of HER2-positive and triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) and include inhibitors of the ErbB family receptors, COX-2 inhibitors, metformin, retinoids, statins, poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase inhibitors, and natural compounds. This review focuses on recent progress in research to develop more effective preventive agents, in particular for prevention of ER-negative breast cancer.
