Protein-protein interactions (PPIs) are essential to life and various diseases states are associated with aberrant PPIs. Therefore significant efforts are dedicated to this new class of therapeutic targets. Even though it might not be possible to modulate the estimated 650,000 PPIs that regulate human life with drug-like compounds, a sizeable number of PPI should be druggable. Only 10-15% of the human genome is thought to be druggable with around 1000-3000 druggable protein targets. A hypothetical similar ratio for PPIs would bring the number of druggable PPIs to about 65,000, although no data can yet support such a hypothesis. PPI have been historically intricate to tackle with standard experimental and virtual screening techniques, possibly because of the shift in the chemical space between today's chemical libraries and PPI physico-chemical requirements. Therefore, one possible avenue to circumvent this conundrum is to design focused libraries enriched in putative PPI inhibitors. Here, we show how chemoinformatics can assist library design by learning physico-chemical rules from a data set of known PPI inhibitors and their comparison with regular drugs. Our study shows the importance of specific molecular shapes and a privileged number of aromatic bonds.
