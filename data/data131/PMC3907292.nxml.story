The molecular mechanisms by which a dog learns to associate a bell ring with incoming food and by which addiction to cocaine is developed have many things in common. In both cases, glutamate-mediated inputs from the cortex converge on striatal neurons with the neuromodulator dopamine whose level increases upon food delivery or cocaine administration. This convergence triggers intracellular reaction cascades that end up modifying the basal state of these neurons into what is currently considered the cellular correlate of learning and its overblown variant: addiction. Understanding these signaling cascades is required to design interventions for the enhancement of cognitive capacities and the prevention/cure of addiction. With this in mind, we developed a model of the dynamics of these reaction cascades upon the administration of cocaine. We did this by gathering the cascades' molecular components and interactions discovered by experimentalist so far and then setting the reaction parameters so that the model reproduces the timing of the molecular changes that lead to the discovery of those components and interactions. With this integrationist endeavor we disclosed some inconsistencies and provided a rationale for experimental observations that were unexplained. Our predictions are readily challengeable with future experiments.
