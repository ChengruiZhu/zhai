. In several experiments pigs developed swine influenza virus infections 9 to 17 days after infestation with infected lungworms in the absence of any known provocative stress. In these instances an immune response of the swine to the lungworms themselves is suspected of having furnished the provocation. 3. During May, June, July, and August, swine prepared by the ingestion of lungworms carrying virus were absolutely refractory to the provocation of influenza, and they were relatively refractory in September and October. The masked virus was activated most readily during the first 4 months of the year. 4. In a single experiment we succeeded in demonstrating by direct means the presence of swine influenza virus in the neighborhood of lungworms at the base of the lung at a time when the virus was not demonstrable anywhere else in the respiratory tract. 5. Masked swine influenza virus was found to be present in lungworm ova obtained either from the respiratory tracts or the feces of infected swine. 6. In a number of instances, masked swine influenza virus has been found to persist for over a year in lungworm larvae within the earthworm intermediate hosts, and in one case its presence was demonstrated after 32 months. 7. Two varieties of a single species of earthworm, namely,
