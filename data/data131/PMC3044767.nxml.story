Both the response and membrane potential of neurons in the primary visual cortex (V1) are selective to the orientation of elongated stimuli. The widths of the tuning curves, which characterize this selectivity, hardly depend on stimulus contrast whereas their amplitude does. The contrast dependence of this amplitude, the contrast response function (CRF), has a sigmoidal shape. Saturation of the spike response is substantially lower than the neurons' maximal firing rate. These well established facts constrain the possible mechanisms for orientation selectivity in V1. Furthermore, the single neuron CRFs in V1 display a broad diversity in their shape. This adds other constraints. Many theoretical works have tried to elaborate mechanisms of orientation selectivity that are compatible with the contrast invariant tuning widths. However, these mechanisms are usually incompatible with sigmoidal CRFs. We propose a mechanism which accounts simultaneously for contrast invariant tuning width for both rate and voltage response and for the shape and diversity of the CRFs. This mechanism relies on the interplay between power-law frequency-current transfer functions of single neurons, as measured in vivo in cortex, and on the recurrent interactions in the cortical circuit.
