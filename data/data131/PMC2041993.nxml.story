Signaling pathways drive biological processes with high specificity. Reductionist approaches such as mutagenesis provide one strategy to identity components of pathways. We used high throughput in situ hybridization to systematically map the spatiotemporal expression pattern of âˆ¼1,000 developmental genes in the mouse embryo. The rich information collectively contained in these patterns was captured in annotation tables that were systematically mined using hierarchical clustering, resulting in 12 groups of genes with related expression patterns. We show that this process generates biologically meaningful, high-content information. The expression pattern of developmental master regulator Pax6 is found in a cluster together with that of 81 other genes. The paired DNA binding domain of Pax6 can bind to regulatory sequences in 14 of the 81 genes. We also found that the expression pattern of all these 14 genes is up- or downregulated in Pax6 mutant mice. These results emphasize that determining the expression pattern of many genes in a systematic way followed by an application of integrative tools leads to the identification of novel candidate components of signaling pathways. More generally, when complemented with appropriate data-mining strategies, transcriptome-scale in situ hybridization can be turned into a powerful instrument for systems biology.
