How would animal life differ if it evolved again on Earth or any other habitable planet? If variation and selection can overwhelm all the other factors that might impede the approach to an optimum, then traits of animals that fulfill similar functional needs—such as camera-type eyes for seeing or wings for flying—are more likely to emerge independently and repeatedly. In aquatic animal swimming, one performance criterion is the Strouhal number (St), which specifies the frequency of fin movement for maximum propulsive efficiency in those animals that use the common “body/caudal fin” swimming mode, such as trout. Here, we use a combination of computational modeling, a robotic knifefish, and measurements of animal swimming behavior to study another widespread form of locomotion—“median/paired fin” swimming, used by animals as diverse as cuttlefish, triggerfish, and rays. Our studies provide quantitative evidence for a complementary performance criterion, called the optimal specific wavelength (OSW), which determines the wavelength of fin movement required for maximum propulsive force or thrust. Adherence to the OSW has independently emerged within eight clades of animals in three different phyla, including vertebrates and invertebrates, encompassing over a thousand species.
