An important limitation in the clinical use of opiates is progressive loss of analgesic efficacy over time. Development of analgesic tolerance is tightly linked to receptor desensitization. In the case of delta opioid receptors (DOR), desensitization is especially swift because receptors are rapidly internalized and are poorly recycled to the membrane. In the present study, we investigated whether Src activity contributed to this sorting pattern and to functional desensitization of DORs. A first series of experiments demonstrated that agonist binding activates Src and destabilizes a constitutive complex formed by the spontaneous association of DORs with the kinase. Src contribution to DOR desensitization was then established by showing that pre-treatment with Src inhibitor PP2 (20 μM; 1 hr) or transfection of a dominant negative Src mutant preserved DOR signalling following sustained exposure to an agonist. This protection was afforded without interfering with endocytosis, but suboptimal internalization interfered with PP2 ability to preserve DOR signalling, suggesting a post-endocytic site of action for the kinase. This assumption was confirmed by demonstrating that Src inhibition by PP2 or its silencing by siRNA increased membrane recovery of internalized DORs and was further corroborated by showing that inhibition of recycling by monensin or dominant negative Rab11 (Rab11S25N) abolished the ability of Src blockers to prevent desensitization. Finally, Src inhibitors accelerated recovery of DOR-Gαl3 coupling after desensitization. Taken together, these results indicate that Src dynamically regulates DOR recycling and by doing so contributes to desensitization of these receptors.
