In vivo and in vitro investigations were performed. In study I, 45 diabetic patients hospitalized for above-knee amputation in the Department of Orthopedics, Affiliated Hospital of Jiangsu University were recruited from February 2010 to June 2015. The patients were categorized based on the severity of anterior tibial artery stenosis, which was assessed by color Doppler ultrasound, into mild stenosis (0% < stenosis < 50%, n = 15), moderate stenosis (50 ≤ stenosis < 70%, n = 15), and severe stenosis/occlusion groups (70 ≤ stenosis ≤ 100%, n = 15). In study II, the specific mechanism of CML in the transmission pathway of the diabetic calcification cascade signal was investigated in A7r5 aortic smooth muscle cells under high-lipid, apoptosis-coexisting conditions. ELISA (for serum CML concentration of patients), ultrasound (for plaque size, calcification, blood flow filling, vascular stenosis etc.), H&E staining (for plaque morphology), vonKossa staining (for qualitative analysis of calcification), calcium content assay (for quantitative analysis of calcification), and Western blot analyses of CML, receptor for advanced glycation end products (RAGE), NADPH oxidase 4, phosphorylated p38, core-binding factor α1 (cbfα1), alkaline phosphatase (ALP) and β-actin were then performed.
