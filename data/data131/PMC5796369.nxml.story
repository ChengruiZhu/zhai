Treatment with rituximab plus a regimen of cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine and prednisolone (CHOP) for patients with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) has proven efficacy in clinical trials. The present study investigated its application in clinical practice. This single-center, retrospective database analysis included patients with DLBCL treated at the Slovenian Institute of Oncology Ljubljana between 2004 and 2013. Overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) were assessed according to International Prognostic Index (IPI) and revised IPI (R-IPI) categories. Overall, 573 patients with DLBCL were included in the study (median follow-up, 45.3 months; range, 0.1–143.0). Patients were categorized as IPI ‘low’ (n=170; 30%), ‘low-intermediate’ (n=134; 23%), ‘high-intermediate’ (n=129; 23%) and ‘high’ (n=140; 24%) risk. R-IPI groups were indicated with ‘very good’ (n=59; 10%), ‘good’ (n=245; 43%) and ‘poor’ (n=269; 47%) prognosis. Ten-year OS and PFS rates were 51 and 72%, respectively; median OS was 124 months and median PFS was not reached. Ten-year OS rates were 80 and 87% in low-risk and ‘very good’ prognosis groups, respectively, and 30 and 37% in high-risk and poor prognosis patients, respectively. This analysis of patients with DLBCL indicated that many patients treated with R-CHOP and R-CHOP-like regimens in the real-world setting have excellent outcomes.
