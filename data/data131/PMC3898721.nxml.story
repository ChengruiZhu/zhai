Unexpected drug efficacy or resistance is poorly understood in cancers because of the lack of systematic analyses of drug response profiles in cancer tissues of various genotypic backgrounds. The recent development of high-throughput technologies has allowed massive screening of chemicals and drugs against panels of heterogeneous cancer cell lines. In parallel, multi-level omics datasets, including genome-wide genetic alterations, gene expression and protein regulation, have been generated from diverse sets of cancer cell lines, thus providing a surrogate system, known as cancer cell line modeling, that can represent cancer diversity. Taken together, recent efforts with cancer cell line modeling have enabled a systematic understanding of the causal factors of varied drug responses in cancers. These large-scale association studies could potentially predict and optimize target windows for drug treatment in cancer patients. The present review provides an overview of the major types of cell line-based large datasets and their applications in cancer studies. Moreover, this review discusses recent integrated approaches that use multi-level datasets to discover synergistic drug combination or repositioning for cancer treatment.
