These findings confirm previous studies that showed that increases in the price of Hib vaccine increase the time to adoption. In addition, they suggest that GAVI eligibility accelerates decisions to adopt this vaccine and show that the decisions made by neighboring countries are important, which suggests that policy diffusion may occur. Thus, in the case of adoption of the Hib vaccine, both supply-side and demand-side factors seem to be important. Its is relevant to note that during writing of the article, JCS, MLS, MRR, APB, and RAH were employed by the Hib Initiative, which was funded by the GAVI Alliance. The findings do not necessarily represent the views, policies or decisions of the Hib Initiative or the GAVI Alliance. Importantly, these findings are explanatory, not predictive, so they cannot be applied directly to new vaccines to improve their rate of adoption. Nevertheless, these findings highlight the potential importance of setting up formal and informal networks to facilitate policy diffusion and suggest that long-term price and supply certainty might be factors that could help to accelerate national decisions to adopt new and/or underutilized vaccines and other public-health technologies.
