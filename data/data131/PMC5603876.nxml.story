In this research study, to investigate teratogenic effect of intravitreal injection of bevacizumab in pregnant rat model, twenty seven female Wistar rats were inseminated. Pregnant rats were divided into 6 groups (three groups as case and three as control groups). Each case and control groups were divided according to the day of intravitreal injections (day 2, 10 and 18). Rats in the case groups received 4 ÂµL intravitreal injection of bevacizumab and the control groups received the same volume of distilled water. The tail and umbilical cord length in case groups 1, 2, and 3 did not display any significant differences compared to their control groups. The fetal weight was significantly lower in the case groups 1 (p>0.001) and 2 (p>0.001) compared to their control groups. Furthermore, the placental weight was only lower in the case group 1 (p>0.001). Case group 2 had a shorter crown rump length in comparison with its control group (p=0.029). Morphological investigations showed two abnormal cases of gastroschisis in group 1 and a case of a cleft in the skull in one of the rats in case group 2. The results show that intravitreal bevacizumab has developmental effect when administered in the early stages of pregnancy; but it is safe when administered in the last week of pregnancy in rats.
