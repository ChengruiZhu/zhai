The reprogramming of pluripotent stem cells from adult cells is a crucial step toward producing patient-specific cells for transplant therapy. Critical to this goal is the ability to reproducibly drive the differentiation of these cells to specific fates, such as cardiac and neural cells. While gene expression is important in tissue specific differentiation, the impact of alternative splicing on the biology of differentiating cells has not been fully realized. To identify specific splicing events that may determine cell-type-specific differentiation, we compared splicing profiles of human embryonic stem cells (ESCs) and derived cardiac and neural precursors using Affymetrix exon tiling arrays. Segregation of splicing profiles into cardiac-restricted and common cardiac/neural differentiation pattern groups revealed unique groups of genes with clear implications for the biology of cardiomyocyte function and the maintenance of pluripotent ESCs. Alternative splicing of many of these genes, notably regulators of cell death and proliferation, were often predicted to impact protein domain or microRNA binding site inclusion, suggesting that the function or expression of these proteins is altered during differentiation. These results provide further evidence that alternative splicing is important in shaping the functional repertoire of ESCs and differentiated cells.
