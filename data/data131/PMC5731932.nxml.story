Alcohol preference induced tolerance in humans and animals when their bodily functions adapt to compensate for the disruption caused by alcohol consumption. This was thought to be an important component of the genetic predisposition to alcoholism. To investigate the underlying mechanisms of hepatic metabolic tolerance during alcohol preference, the alcohol preferring and alcohol non-preferring rats were used in this study. The liver mitochondria were purified for comparative quantitative proteomics analysis, and the liver metabolite extracts were collected for metabolomics analysis. Our study identified 96 differentially expressed hepatic mitochondrial proteins that associated with alcohol preference, the further gene ontology and protein interaction network analysis suggest a down-regulation of amino acid metabolism and up-regulation of lipid metabolism. We found alcohol preference induced a series of enzymes decreased (e.g. SSADH and GABA-T) and several amino acids increased (e.g. glutamate and aspartate) in rat liver, indicating down-regulations of glutamate degradation occurred during alcohol preference. Most of these changes were due to the genetic differences between alcohol preferring and non-preferring animals. Furthermore, this study would provided new insights to further clarify the mechanisms of hepatic metabolic tolerance during alcohol preference.
