Tamoxifen, a potent anticancer agent known to interrupt the
enhanced estrogen activity of malignant mammary gland cells, was recently approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of breast cancer. In this investigation, the toxic effects of tamoxifen were evaluated through cell multiplication, and cytological, surface ultrastructural, and biochemical studies on human cervical carcinoma cells (HeLa) and/or murine erythroleukemic (MEL) cells (BB-88). Tamoxifen treatment
demonstrated an inhibitory effect on HeLa cell multiplication at lower concentrations and toxicity at higher concentrations and longer treatment durations. The drug also triggered morphological and biochemical changes as revealed by light microscopy, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), fluorescence microscopy, Nucleosome ELISA, and the DNA smear pattern. Cytological observations showed nuclear condensation, cell shrinkage, multinucleation, and apoptotic bodies. Surface ultrastructure of tamoxifen treated cells examined under the SEM revealed abnormalities such as
membrane blebbing, holes, and cytoplasmic extrusions, all of which are characteristics of programmed cell death (apoptosis). Redistribution of the membrane phospholipid phosphatidylserine (PS) from the protoplasmic surface of the plasma membrane to the cell surface was identified using annexin V-enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) in tamoxifen treated MEL BB-88 cells, a general feature of cells undergoing apoptosis. Tamoxifen
treated cells demonstrated internucleosomal damages of the genomic DNA and DNA fragmentations, evidenced by an increase in free nucleosomes, and distinctive DNA smear patterns on the agarose gel.
