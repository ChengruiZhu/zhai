The poor survival rate of transplanted mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) within the ischemic heart limits their therapeutic potential for cardiac repair. Adrenomedullin (ADM) has been identified as a potent apoptotic inhibitor. The present study aimed to investigate the protective effects of ADM on MSCs against hypoxia and serum deprivation (H/SD)-induced apoptosis, and to determine the potential underlying mechanisms. In the present study, a recombinant adenovirus expressing the ADM gene was established and was infected into MSCs. The infection rate was determined via microscopic detection of green fluorescence and flow cytometric analysis. The mRNA expression levels of ADM were detected by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. In addition, a model of H/SD was generated. The MSCs were randomly separated into six groups: Control, enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP)-Adv, EGFP-ADM, H/SD, EGFP-Adv + H/SD and EGFP-ADM + H/SD. Cell viability and proliferation were determined using the Cell Counting kit-8 assay. Apoptosis was assessed by terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated-dUTP nick-end labeling assay and flow cytometric analysis using Annexin V-phycoerythrin/7-aminoactinomycin D staining. The protein expression levels of total protein kinase B (Akt), phosphorylated (p)-Akt, total glycogen synthase kinase (GSK)3β, p-GSK3β, B-cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2), Bcl-2-associated X protein (Bax), caspase-3 and cleaved caspase-3 were detected by western blot analysis. The results indicated that ADM overexpression could improve MSC proliferation and viability, and protect MSCs against H/SD-induced apoptosis. In addition, ADM overexpression increased Akt and GSK3β phosphorylation, and Bcl-2/Bax ratio, and decreased the activation of caspase-3. These results suggested that ADM protects MSCs against H/SD-induced apoptosis, which may be mediated via the Akt/GSK3β and Bcl-2 signaling pathways.
