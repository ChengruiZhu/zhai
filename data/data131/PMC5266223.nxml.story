Statins, such as simvastatin, and ACE inhibitors (ACEis), such as ramipril, are standard therapies for the prevention and treatment of cardiovascular diseases. These types of drugs are commonly administered together. More recently, angiotensin II type 1 receptor (AT1R) antagonists, such as candesartan cilexetil (candesartan), have been used in the place of, or in combination with, ACEis. Here, we investigated the effects of simvastatin and ramipril single and combination therapy, and candesartan treatment on the lifespan of isocalorically fed, long-lived, B6C3F1 mice. Males were used for their relative endocrine simplicity and to minimize animal usage. The drugs were administered daily in food. The simvastatin and ramipril combination therapy significantly increased the mean and median lifespan by 9Â %. In contrast, simvastatin, ramipril, or candesartan monotherapy was ineffective. All groups consumed the same number of calories. Simvastatin, alone or administered with ramipril, decreased body weight without changing caloric consumption, suggesting it may alter energy utilization in mice. Combination therapy elevated serum triglyceride and glucose levels, consistent with altered energy homeostasis. Few significant or consistent differences were found in mortality-associated pathologies among the groups. Simvastatin treatment did not reduce normal serum cholesterol or lipid levels in these mice, suggesting that the longevity effects may stem from the
