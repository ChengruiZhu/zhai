Cajal bodies, discovered more than 100 years ago by Santiago Ramón y Cajal, are sub-organelles found in the nucleus of proliferative cells and neurons. They have been implicated in a variety of nuclear functions including ribonucleoprotein maturation, spliceosome formation, histone mRNA processing, RNA polymerase assembly, telomerase biogenesis, and histone gene transcription. Concentrating relevant molecules within Cajal bodies may serve to increase the efficiency of specific nuclear functions. Here we identify the WRAP53 protein as an essential factor for Cajal body maintenance and for directing the splicing regulatory protein “survival of motor neuron” (SMN) complex to Cajal bodies. We show that WRAP53 is a constitutive component of Cajal bodies, and that knockdown of WRAP53 disrupts existing Cajal bodies and prevents formation of new Cajal bodies. Mechanistically, we find that WRAP53 recruits the SMN complex from the cytoplasm to Cajal bodies by mediating interactions between SMN, importinβ, and coilin. Finally, we report deficient WRAP53–SMN binding in patients with spinal muscular atrophy, suggesting a role in this pathology. This study not only reveals new functions of the WRAP53 protein, but also increases our understanding of the molecular mechanism behind Cajal body formation and recruitment of factors to Cajal bodies.
