Due to the sheer number of neurons and the complexity of their interactions, the modelling of brain activity is particularly challenging. How can computationally tractable models of brain function be developed that are nevertheless biologically plausible? The “mean field” approach, borrowed from statistical physics, is to model the average activity of populations of neurons rather than the behaviour of individual neurons. While a large number of promising theories have been developed with this approach, they fall short of biological fidelity in the way interactions between distant populations have been modelled. In particular, it is often assumed that all neurons interact via connections of very similar conduction velocity, when in fact experiment suggests quite the opposite: populations of neurons are connected by axonal fibres with a broad range of velocities. We develop here activity propagators that provide for the first time the ability to realistically and efficiently simulate connectivity in mean field theories, and demonstrate how to use them to fit successfully experimental data from both human and rat. With our novel propagators, one can thus study on an empirical basis the role of activity propagation in both healthy and diseased mammalian brains.
