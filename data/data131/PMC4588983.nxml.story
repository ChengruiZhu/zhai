Computed tomography (CT) was performed on four cadaveric proximal tibias and four scapulae, allowing for 16 glenoid-tibial comparative combinations. 3D CT models were created and exported into point cloud models. A local coordinate map of the glenoid and medial tibial plateau articular surfaces was created. Two zones of the medial tibial articular surface (anterior and posterior) were quantified. The glenoid articular surface was defined as a best-fit circle of the glenoid articular surface maintaining a 2mm bony rim (Figure 1). This surface was virtually placed on a point on the tibial articular surface in 3D space. The tibial surface was segmented and its 3D surface orientation was determined by an eigenvector in the direction of its surface. 3D orientation of the glenoid surface was reoriented so that an eigenvector in the direction of the glenoid surface matched that of the tibial surface (Figure 2). The least distances between the point-clouds on the glenoid and tibial surfaces were calculated. The glenoid surface was rotated 360 degrees around the eigenvector with one degree increments and the mean least distance was determined at each rotating angle. A non-parametric wilcoxon signed rank statistical analysis was performed to compare the findings between the anterior and posterior aspects of the medial tibial articular surface with respect to the glenoid.
