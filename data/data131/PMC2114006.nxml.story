We have examined the effects of the antimicrotubule agent benomyl and several mutations on nuclear and mitochondrial movement in germlings of the filamentous fungus Aspergillus nidulans. While, as previously reported, benomyl inhibited nuclear division and movement, it did not inhibit mitochondrial movement. To test the effects of benomyl more rigorously, we germinated two benomyl super-sensitive, beta-tubulin mutants at a benomyl concentration 50-100 times greater than that required to inhibit colony formation completely. Again nuclear division and movement were inhibited, but mitochondrial movement was not. We also examined conditionally lethal beta-tubulin mutations that disrupt microtubule function under restrictive conditions. Nuclear division and movement were inhibited but, again, mitochondrial movement was not. Finally we examined the effects of five heat-sensitive mutations that inhibit nuclear movement but not nuclear division at restrictive temperatures. These mutations strongly inhibited nuclear movement at a restrictive temperature but did not inhibit mitochondrial movement. These data demonstrate that the mechanisms of nuclear and mitochondrial movement in Aspergillus nidulans are not identical and suggest that mitochondrial movement does not require functional microtubules.
