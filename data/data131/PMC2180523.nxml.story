 Using anti-allotype sera and AKR anti θC3H sera, a requirement for two cell types has been demonstrated in the adoptive secondary response of mice to heterologous erythrocytes. The cell types have been designated B cells [precursors of plaque-forming cells (PFC)] and T cells (thymus-influenced cells, not providing precursors of detectable PFC). The in vivo indirect PFC response of spleen cells from primed mice is markedly reduced by in vitro treatment of the cells with a mixture of anti-θ serum and guinea pig serum (Anti θ + GPS). This B cell response is fully restored to control levels by thymus cells from normal mice which do not themselves provide precursors of indirect PFC. Thus memory is carried by the B cell lineage but the expression of this memory is dependent on the presence of a cell population which is sensitive to Anti θ + GPS and which is replaced functionally by unprimed T cells. When assayed for T cell activity, thoracic duct cells from specifically primed mice are better than cells from nonspecifically primed mice in restoring the B cell response of spleen cells from immunized mice. Moreover, the T cell activity of a reconstitutive cell population from primed mice is reduced by incubation with Anti θ + GPS. We conclude that memory to heterologous erythrocyte antigens is carried by the T cell lineage as well as the B cell lineage even though unprimed T cells are sufficient for expression of B cell memory.
