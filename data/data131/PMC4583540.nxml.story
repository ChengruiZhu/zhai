CD24, a small heavily glycosylated mucin-like glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored cell surface protein, plays an important role in the carcinogenesis of various human malignancies. However, its function in cervical cancer remains unclear. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the expression of CD24 clinicopathologically and to analyze its functional behavior biologically in cervical cancer. A total of 117 uterine cervical cancer tumors were immunohistochemically analyzed using a CD24 monoclonal antibody on paraffin blocks. We also examined whether CD24 enhanced the invasive activity or the Akt, ERK, NF-κB and MMP activity in a uterine cervical cancer cell line (CaSki) by a western blot analysis. The patients with enhanced CD24 expression had a higher rate of advanced clinical stage (50 vs. 16.5%, p<0.01), lymph node metastasis (34.6 vs. 14.3%) and lymphovascular involvement (65.4 vs. 20.4%, p=0.01), and a poor overall and disease-free survival (5-year survival rate: 62 vs. 86%, p=0.03). CD24 overexpression in CaSki cells resulted in activation of Cell Signaling proteins, including Akt, ERK, NF-κB and MMP-9. An invasion assay showed that CD24 overexpression in CaSki cells led to increased invasion ability. The CD24 overexpression also increased mRNA expression of Slug but not Snail. Moreover, the CD24 overexpression also decreased expression of E-cadherin and increased N-cadherin protein levels. Increased expression of CD24 may be associated with tumor progression and prognosis in patients with uterine cervical cancer. CD24 expression may therefore be used not only as a prognostic marker in uterine cervical cancer, but also as a target for the development of new therapeutic approaches.
