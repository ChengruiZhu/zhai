The purpose of this study was to verify the influence of flask closure methods and post-pressing times on tooth displacement in maxillary dentures. Twenty similar maxillary dentures were made using a heat-polymerized acrylic resin, and randomly assigned to 4 experimental groups (n=5) according to the protocol: 1-conventional flask closure and immediate polymerization; 2- conventional flask closure and polymerization after 6-hour post-pressing time; 3- RS flask closure system and immediate polymerization; and 4- RS flask closure system and polymerization after 6-hour post-pressing time. Three transverse and 2 anteroposterior linear distances between teeth were measured before and after the denture processing with an optical microscope with accuracy of 0.0005mm. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) and Tukeyâ€™s test were performed to compare the results. The 6-hour post-pressing time (conventional = 0.44mm and RS = 0.33mm) showed no statistically significant difference in tooth movement, in relation to the flask closure methods, when compared to the immediate time (conventional = 0.40mm and RS = 0.28mm). The RS system standardized the tooth displacement, independently of the post-pressing times. Dimensional changes were more uniform when the dentures were submitted to the 6-hour post-pressing time and RS flask closure method, suggesting that these factors may reduce the magnitude of tooth movement.
