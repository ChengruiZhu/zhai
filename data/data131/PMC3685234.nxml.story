The aim of the paper is to present the results obtained by utilization of an original approach called Molecular Descriptors Family on Structure-Property (MDF-SPR) and Structure-Activity Relationships (MDF-SAR) applied on classes of chemical compounds and its usefulness as precursors of models elaboration of new compounds with better properties and/or activities and low production costs. The MDF-SPR/MDF-SAR methodology integrates the complex information obtained from compound’s structure in unitary efficient models in order to explain properties/activities. The methodology has been applied on a number of thirty sets of chemical compounds. The best subsets of molecular descriptors family members able to estimate and predict property/activity of interest were identified and were statistically and visually analyzed. The MDF-SPR/MDF-SAR models were validated through internal and/or external validation methods. The estimation and prediction abilities of the MDF-SPR/MDF-SAR models were compared with previous reported models by applying of correlated correlation analysis, which revealed that the MDF-SPR/MDF-SAR methodology is reliable. The MDF-SPR/MDF-SAR methodology opens a new pathway in understanding the relationships between compound’s structure and property/activity, in property/activity prediction, and in discovery, investigation and characterization of new chemical compounds, more competitive as costs and property/activity, being a method less expensive comparative with experimental methods.
