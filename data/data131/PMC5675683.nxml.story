 M DEX significantly increased TG concentration and expression of miR-130b as well as its target gene peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ (PPAR-γ). Dual-luciferase reporter assays indicated that PPAR-γ expression was negatively regulated by miR-130b, while this effect was abolished with cotransfection of miR-130b and miR-130b inhibitor. In addition, miR-130b-DEX did not change cell proliferation but significantly decreased TG concentration and PPAR-γ expression compared to miR-SC-DEX cells, while miR-130b-inhibitor-DEX cells presented opposite results. Furthermore, miR-130b-DEX significantly reduced expression of PPAR-γ downstream factor perilipin 1 as well as adipogenesis genes fatty acid synthase, acetyl coenzyme A carboxylase, 11β hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 1 and fat mass and obesity-associated gene, whereas expression as well as enzyme activity of adipose triglyceride lipase and hormone-sensitive lipase were greatly increased. Overall, these results clarified the role of miR-130b in DEX-induced increase of lipid accumulation in porcine preadipocytes, suggesting that miR-130b might be deemed as a novel potential therapeutic target for DEX-induced increase of lipid accumulation, and consequently provide new insights in obesity control.
