Distraction osteogenesis (DO), one of effective therapies for bone regeneration, has been received more attention in recent years. However, the underlying mechanism remains elusive. Recently, microRNAs (miRNAs) have been reported to play important roles in regulating osteogenesis and bone formation. We therefore provided the hypothesis that miRNAs could involve in the DO-mediated bone regeneration. After successfully established the DO model of rats, a miRNA microarray was performed to find the differently expressed miRNAs in DO and control groups in this study. As one of the most downregulated miRNAs, miR-144-3p was found to be decreased during osteogenic differentiation in mesenchymal stem cells of rats (rBMSCs) and DO model. And miR-144-3p overexpression suppressed the osteogenesis while its inhibitor promoted osteogenesis. Furthermore, Connexin-43, an essential regulator for osteogenesis, was validated to be a novel target for miR-144-3p. Finally, miR-144-3p inhibitor modified MSCs promoted mineralization of distracted bone in rat DO model. In conclusion, miR-144-3p was found to regulate osteogenesis and inhibition of miR-144-3p resulted in acceleration of mineralization of DO, which not only give clues to understanding the mechanism of DO but also provide a potential therapeutic target in clinical practice.
