This study utilized the rabbit ocular model of HSV-1 infection and reactivation, induced by the transcorneal iontophoresis of epinephrine (TCIE), to characterize changes to chromatin that occur between 0.5 and 4 h following the application of the reactivation stimulus. Our goal was to explore the hypothesis that chromatin remodeling is an early and essential step in the process of HSV-1 reactivation. Analysis of the HSV-1 latently infected rabbit trigeminal ganglia (TG) showed that enrichment of the euchromatic marker H3K4me2 significantly decreased in the LAT 5′exon region (∼2.5-fold) and significantly increased in the lytic ICP4 promoter region (∼3-fold) by 1 h post-TCIE in the highly efficient reactivating McKrae strain of HSV-1. In contrast, we observed no significant change in the euchromatic marks of H3K4me2 associated with LAT 5′exon or ICP4 promoter regions of the poorly reactivating KOS strain of HSV-1 following TCIE through 4 h. The implication that these observed epigenetic changes were linked to transcriptional activity was confirmed by qRT-PCR examining both LAT and lytic transcript abundance following TCIE. We found a significant decrease in the abundance of LAT RNA by 2 h post-iontophoresis of epinephrine coupled to an increase in the transcript abundance of ICP4 in the McKrae strain of HSV-1. By comparison, we observed no change in the LAT or ICP4 transcript abundance of the poor reactivator KOS following iontophoresis of epinephrine through 4 h.
