 induction of stabilin-1 in macrophages requires the presence of glucocorticoids. Stabilin-1 is involved in two intracellular trafficking pathways: receptor mediated endocytosis and recycling; and shuttling between the endosomal compartment and trans-Golgi network (TGN). The latter intracellular pathway of stabilin-1 trafficking is mediated by GGAs, clathrin adaptors that interact with the DDSLL motif in the cytoplasmic tail of stabilin-1. When expressed by alternatively activated macrophages, stabilin-1 mediates the uptake and targeting for degradation of acLDL and SPARC, a regulator of tissue remodeling. Likewise, stabilin-1 in macrophages is involved in intracellular sorting and lysosomal delivery of the novel stabilin-1-interacting chitinase-like protein (SI-CLP). Indirect evidence suggests that stabilin-1 is involved in adhesion and transmigration in various cell types (including tumor cells, leukocytes, and lymphocytes); however, its rapid recycling and scant level of surface expression argue against its universal role in cell adhesion. In summary, stabilin-1 is a homeostatic receptor which links signals from the extracellular environment to intracellular vesicular processes, creating a potential impact on the macrophage secretion profile.
