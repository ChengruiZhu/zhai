As there was a similar distribution of experienced and less experienced surgeons among the respondents, the results obtained from the questionnaire are significant in terms of reflecting the general perspective in the country. That mosaicplasty was the first choice for lesions over 2.5cm2 in individuals with a high activity level may be related to poor long-term results of microfracture in large defects. Although it is not widely used in our country and social security repayments are limited, it was noteworthy that for defects over 4cm2, the first choice was second generation autologous chondrocyte implantation. Similarly, it is significant that a third of the surgeons stated matrix-supported microfracture as a choice for high activity patients, although it is not often applied. Decision makers in institutions making repayments should take into account that large defects require methods which are relatively more expensive and need high technology. The results obtained here of an upper age limit of 50 years and BMI below 30kg/m2 for cartilage repair are consistent with literature. A return to sports is planned as 6 months at the earliest and a longer period after more complex surgery.
