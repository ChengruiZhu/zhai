 cells, donor-recipient sex and blood-type matching, prophylactic treatment of graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), grades of GVHD, Epstein-Barr virus or cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection, post-transplantation lymphoproliferative disorders and hepatic veno-occlusive disease. Data were analyzed by univariate and multivariate conditional logistic regression analyses. Among the 124 patients who underwent allo-HSCT, 15 developed PGF (12.1%). Univariate logistic regression analysis identified age, donor-recipient blood type and CMV infection (in 30 days) as potential risk factors for PGF. Multivariate analysis of factors with P<0.1 in univariate analysis showed that age, donor-recipient blood type and CMV infection (in 30 days) were significant risk factors for PGF. Patients were divided into subgroups based on age <20, 20-30, 30-40, and >40 years. The risk of PGF increased 2.747-fold (odds ratio (OR)=2.625, 95% confidence interval: 1.411-5.347) for each increment in age level. Patients with mismatched blood type (OR=4.051) or CMV infection (OR=9.146) had an increased risk of PGF. We conclude that age, donor-recipient blood-type matching and CMV infection are major risk factors for PGF after allo-HSCT.
