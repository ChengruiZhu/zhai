Jumping genes are DNA sequences present in the genome of most living organisms. They contribute to genome dynamics and occasionally result in hereditary genetic diseases or cancer. L1 elements are the only autonomously active jumping genes in the human genome. They replicate through an RNAâ€“mediated copy-and-paste mechanism by cleaving the host genome and then using this new DNA end as a primer to reverse transcribe its own RNA, generating a new L1 DNA copy. The molecular determinants that influence L1 target site choice are not fully understood. Here we present a quantitative assay to measure the influence of DNA target site sequence and structure on the reverse transcription step. By testing more than 65 potential DNA primers, we observe that not all sites are equally extended by the L1 machinery, and we define the rules guiding this process. In particular, we highlight the importance of partial sequence complementarity between the target site and the L1 RNA extremity, but also the high level of flexibility of this process, since detrimental terminal mismatches can be compensated by an increasing number of interacting nucleotides. We propose that this mechanism contributes to the distribution of new L1 insertions within the human genome.
