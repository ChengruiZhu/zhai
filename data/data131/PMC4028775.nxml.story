High glucose (30 mM) induced significant apoptosis in serum-starved NRVMs as compared with normal glucose (5 mM) control (12.01 ± 0.76% vs. 2.86 ± 0.55%; P < 0.001). Treatment with IGF1 attenuated hyperglycemia-induced apoptosis by 68% (3.23 ± 0.76% vs. 9.97 ± 1.29%; P < 0.001; n = 3) in comparison with the non-treated control. Treatment with PI3K inhibitor LY294002 enhanced hyperglycemia-induced apoptosis by 109% (20.83 ± 1.87% vs. 9.97 ± 1.29%; P < 0.001; n = 3) in comparison with the non-treated control. Over-expression of AKT by transduction with CA-AKT attenuated hyperglycemia-induced apoptosis by 47% (5.48 ± 0.35% vs.10.31 ± 0.94%; P < 0.001; n = 3) in comparison with the empty-vector control. Transduction with DN-AKT enhanced high glucose-induced apoptosis by 105% (21.13 ± 1.11% vs. 10.31 ± 0.94%; P < 0.001; n = 3) in comparison with the empty-vector control. Western blotting showed that high glucose induced a significant increase in FOXO3a nuclear localization. Luciferase reporter assay showed that high glucose induced a significant increase of 310% (P < 0.001; n = 3) in FOXO3a transcriptional activity against Fas ligand when NRVMs were transducted with TM-FOXO3a in comparison with the empty-vector control.
