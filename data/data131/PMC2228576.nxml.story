It has been hypothesized that the light-evoked rod hyperpolarization (the receptor potential) initiates the light-evoked decrease in extracellular potassium ion concentration, [K+]o, in the distal retina. The hypothesis was tested using the isolated, superfused retina of the toad, Bufo marinus; the receptor potential was recorded intracellularly from red rods, and [K+]o was measured in the photoreceptor layer with K+-specific microelectrodes. In support of the hypothesis, variations in stimulus irradiance or duration, or in retinal temperature, produced qualitatively similar effects on both the receptor potential and the decrease in [K+]o. A mechanism for the relationship between the receptor potential and the decrease in [K+]o was suggested by Matsuura et al. (1978. Vision Res. 18:767-775). In the dark, the passive efflux of K+ out of the rod is balanced by an equal influx of K+ fromthe Na+/K+ pump. The light-evoked rod hyperpolarization is assumed to reduce the passive efflux, with little effect on the pump. Thus, the influx will exceed the efflux, and [K+]o will decrease. Consistent with this mechanism, the largest and most rapid decrease in [K+]o was measured adjacent to the rod inner segments, where the Na+/K+ pump is most likely located; in addition, inhibition of the pump with ouabain abolished the decrease in [K]o more rapidly than the rod hyperpolarization. Based upon this mechanism, Matsuura et al. (1978) developed a mathematical model: over a wide range of stimulus irradiance, this model successfully predicts the time-course of the decrease in [K+]o, given only the time-course of the rod hyperpolarization.
