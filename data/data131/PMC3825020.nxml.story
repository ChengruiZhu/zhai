An experiment was conducted with eight cochlear implant subjects to investigate the feasibility of using electrically evoked compound action potential (ECAP) measures other than ECAP thresholds to predict the way that behavioral thresholds change with rate of stimulation, and hence, whether they can be used without combination with behavioral measures to determine program stimulus levels for cochlear implants. Loudness models indicate that two peripheral neural response characteristics contribute to the slope of the threshold versus rate function: the way that neural activity to each stimulus pulse decreases as rate increases and the slope of the neural response versus stimulus current function. ECAP measures related to these two characteristics were measured: the way that ECAP amplitude decreases with stimulus rate and the ECAP amplitude growth function, respectively. A loudness model (incorporating temporal integration and the two neural response characteristics) and regression analyses were used to evaluate whether the ECAP measures could predict the average slope of the behavioral threshold versus current function and whether individual variation in the measures could predict individual variation in the slope of the threshold function. The average change of behavioral threshold with increasing rate was well predicted by the model when using the average ECAP data. However, the individual variations in the slope of the thresholds versus rate functions were not well predicted by individual variations in ECAP data. It was concluded that these ECAP measures are not useful for fully objective programming, possibly because they do not accurately reflect the neural response characteristics assumed by the model, or are measured at current levels much higher than threshold currents.
