750 sports medicine physicians were sent a survey request to participate in this IRB approved study. 522 responses were obtained for an overall response rate of 70%. 99% of respondents were orthopaedic surgeons. The majority of respondents were from the Northeastern U.S. (32%) and male (96%). Most have been in practice for over 20 years (40%) and were from private practice single specialty groups (58%). 80% of respondents strongly agreed with the statement that conflict disclosure is important when interpreting study results. 62% of respondents reported always reading the disclosure slide during academy or other meeting presentations. 41% of respondents reported always using this information when deciding how to interpret scientific data. Using a case series design with significant positive results at an academic center, 24% reported that the study was likely trustworthy. When the setting of the study was changed to a community hospital, this number decreased to 5%. When no significant difference was found between the groups, 42% believed the study to be trustworthy. When the study design was Level I evidence (RCT trial) and at an academic center, 57% believed the study to be trustworthy. With the same criteria but at a community hospital, this number decreased to 39%. When the results of this design showed no difference among groups, the majority of respondents believed the study to be trustworthy (62%).
