We have identified 5 generations of oculists in Woolhouse’s family, by the names of Atwood, Stepkins, Ivy, and Beaumont. Woolhouse taught students from across Europe. He was one of the early proponents in Europe, inspired by Asian medical practices, to perform paracentesis to release aqueous for a new condition called hydrophthalmia. In Woolhouse’s system, some of these cases probably described angle-closure glaucoma. He was the first to attach the name glaucoma to the palpably hard eye in 1707. He may also have been the first to teach that a soft eye was unlikely to recover vision. Credit for these teachings has traditionally gone to one of his students, Johannes Zacharias Platner, in 1745. Some historians have stated that he proposed iridectomy as a theoretical procedure, which was later performed by Cheselden. In fact, Woolhouse described techniques he had performed which today would be called pupilloplasty, synechiolysis, or pupillary membrane lysis. He was also a pioneer in dacryocystectomy for chronic dacryocystitis and in congenital cataract surgery. His writings from 1716 onward repeatedly (and correctly) stressed that most of the patients with visual disorders required depression of the crystalline lens (for what he called glaucoma), as opposed to removal of an anterior membrane (which he called cataract).
