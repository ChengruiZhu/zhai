Objectives: This study aimed to evaluate the accuracy of Root ZX in determining working length in presence of normal saline, 0.2% chlorhexidine and 2.5% of sodium hypochlorite.
Material and Methods: Sixty extracted, single rooted, single canal human teeth were used. Teeth were decoronated at CEJ and actual canal length determined. Then working length measurements were obtained with Root ZX in presence of normal saline 0.9%, 0.2% chlorhexidine and 2.5% NaOCl. The working length obtained with Root ZX were compared with actual canal length and subjected to statistical analysis.
Results: No statistical significant difference was found between actual canal length and Root ZX measurements in presence of normal saline and 0.2% chlorhexidine. Highly statistical difference was found between actual canal length and Root ZX measurements in presence of 2.5% of NaOCl, however all the measurements were within the clinically acceptable range of ±0.5mm.
Conclusion: The accuracy of EL measurement of Root ZX within±0.5 mm of AL was consistently high in the presence of 0.2% chlorhexidine, normal saline and 2.5% sodium hypochlorite. 
Clinical significance: This study signifies the efficacy of ROOT ZX (Third generation apex locator) as a dependable aid in endodontic working length.
