Non-contact detection characteristic of Doppler radar provides an unobtrusive means of respiration detection and monitoring. This paper presents an evaluation of the of use of microwave Doppler radar for real-time capture of different dynamics of breathing patterns, which could be used to gain further insights into respiratory disorders and refine diagnostic procedures. Several known breathing disorders were professionally role played and captured in a real-time laboratory environment using a non-contact Doppler radar to evaluate its feasibility. In addition, inhalation and exhalation flow patterns under different breathing scenarios were investigated to further support the feasibility of Doppler radar to accurately estimate the tidal volume. The results obtained for both experiments were compared with the gold standard measurement schemes such as respiration belt and spirometry readings, yielding significant correlations with the Doppler radar based information. Doppler radar is highlighted as an alternative approach not only for determining respiration rates but also for identifying breathing patterns and tidal volumes as a preferred non-wearable alternative to the conventional contact-sensing methods.
