Searching a protein or DNA sequence database to find sequences that are evolutionarily related to a query is one of the foundational problems in computational biology. These database searches rely on pairwise comparisons of sequence similarity between the query and targets, but despite years of method refinements, pairwise comparisons still often fail to detect more distantly related targets. In this study, we adapt recent work from natural language processing to exploit the global structure of the data space in this detection problem. In particular, we borrow the idea of a semantic embedding, where by training on a large text data set, one learns an embedding of words into a low-dimensional semantic space such that words embedded close to each other are likely to be semantically related. We present the ProtEmbed algorithm, which learns an embedding of protein sequences into a semantic space where evolutionarily-related proteins are embedded in close proximity. The flexible training algorithm allows additional pieces of evidence, such as 3D structural information, to be incorporated in the learning process and enables ProtEmbed to achieve state-of-the-art performance for the task of detecting targets that have remote evolutionary relationships to the query.
