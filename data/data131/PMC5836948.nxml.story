 using data from 5908 participants in 5 randomized, double‐blind, placebo‐controlled clinical trials. Participants were randomized to liraglutide or a comparator group (placebo or orlistat). The objective was to evaluate whether cardiovascular risk was increased with liraglutide treatment. The primary composite outcome of this time‐to‐event analysis was the first occurrence of cardiovascular death, nonfatal myocardial infarction or nonfatal stroke. These cardiovascular events were adjudicated prospectively for three of the trials and retrospectively for two trials by an event adjudication committee. The primary outcome was analyzed using a Cox proportional hazards model, stratified by trial. With liraglutide 3.0 mg, 8 participants had positively adjudicated cardiovascular events (1.54 events/1000 person‐years) compared to 10 participants in the comparators group (3.65 events/1000 person‐years). The hazard ratio for liraglutide 3.0 mg compared to comparators was 0.42 (95% confidence interval, 0.17‐1.08). In this analysis, liraglutide 3.0 mg treatment was not associated with excess cardiovascular risk. However, the wide confidence intervals and retrospective adjudication of events in two of the trials are limitations of the analysis.
