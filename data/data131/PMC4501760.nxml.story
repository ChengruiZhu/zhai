Learning to read is a chief developmental milestone with lifelong consequences; although there are effective interventions for struggling readers, an ongoing challenge has been to identify candidates for intervention at a young-enough age. We measured the precision of the neural coding of consonants in noise, and found that pre-reading children (4 y old) with stronger neural processing had superior early literacy skills; one year later they were also stronger emerging readers. We applied the same neural coding measure to a cohort of older children: in addition to predicting these childrenâ€™s literacy achievement, we could reliably predict which of the children had received a diagnosis of a reading impairment. Taken together, these results suggest that the neural coding of speech in noise plays a fundamental role in language development. Children who struggle to listen in noisy environments may struggle to make meaning of the language they hear on a daily basis, which can in turn set them at risk for literacy challenges. Evaluating the neural coding of speech in noise may provide an objective neurophysiological marker for these at-risk children, opening a door to early and specific interventions that may stave off a life spent struggling to read.
