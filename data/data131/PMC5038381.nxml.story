Hemangioblastomas (HBMs) are highly vascular tumors of the central nervous system. Sporadic HBMs are nearly always solitary, and solitary HBMs are similar to intracranial arteriovenous malformations due to their highly vascular characteristics. However, to the best of our knowledge, cases of HBM in the cerebellum mimicking an aneurysm have never been reported in the literature. The present study reports a case of an HBM on the right cerebellar hemisphere mimicking an aneurysm, which originated from the right posterior inferior cerebellar artery, as determined using magnetic resonance angiography and digital subtraction angiography. The patient was admitted the Department of Neurosurgery at the Tsinghua University Yuquan Hospital (Beijing, China) in January 2015 due to a 4-year history of intermittent headaches. The diagnosis of an HBM was determined during surgery and the tumor was totally resected by changing the operation technique, with no complications. In conclusion, it is difficult to distinguish between HBMs and intracranial vascular diseases, particularly aneurysms. Surgeons should consider the possibility carefully prior to surgery and careful prepare for each eventuality.
