Enhanced expression of the ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter protein ABC sub-family G member 2 (ABCG2) in cancer stem cells (CSCs) plays a major role in chemotherapeutic drug efflux, which results in therapy failure and tumor relapse. In addition to downregulating apoptosis in CSCs, it has been reported that the transcriptional upregulation of the redox sensing factor Nrf2 is involved in the upregulation of ABCG2 expression and consequent chemoresistance. The current study investigated the presence of cancer stem-like side population (SP) cells from head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) samples, and evaluated the Nrf2 expression profile and multidrug resistance properties of HNSCC stem cells. Fluorescence-activated cell sorting was used for SP cells detection, while reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction was used for the analysis of Nrf2 expression. The present study identified ~2.1% SP cells present in HNSCC specimens, which were positive for cluster of differentiation (CD)133 expression and displayed significantly elevated messenger RNA expression of Nrf2, compared with non-SP cells. These data suggest that the ABC transporter ABCG2 is highly upregulated in SP cells, and this results in multidrug resistance. In addition, these CD133
