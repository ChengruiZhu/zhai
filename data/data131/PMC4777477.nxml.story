Common descent is the hallmark of Darwinian evolution. Homology of biological traits, and particularly of protein sequences and structures, serves as an indication for divergence from a common ancestor and a means of assigning phylogenetic relationships. However, because of shared functional demands and chemical-physical constraints, proteins that evolved independently of one another often converge on very similar molecular traits, including structure and sequence. We tested the widely accepted hypothesis of common ancestry of several major enzyme classes, comprising hundreds of different families and using different cofactors and catalytic chemistries. Although they share the same overall architecture—the Rossmann fold—these enzymes show no significant sequence homology across different classes. We describe an analysis based on the omnipresence of a single residue across these classes: an acidic aspartate or glutamate residue that binds ribose, the common denominator of the different cofactors used by these enzymes. We show that Rossmann enzymes possess a unique interaction geometry that represents a fingerprint of common ancestry rather than an outcome of molecular constraint. We thus provide the first systematic test of divergence versus convergence of a highly abundant protein motif and assign common descent in one of the most ancient and functionally diverse protein folds.
