Cow’s milk protein allergy (CMPA) is the most common food allergy in infants and can affect a family’s quality of life. The purpose of this paper is to evaluate the knowledge and experience of general practitioners (GPs) in terms of CMPA diagnosis and management and to explore the views of parents on the current diagnostic process. Two surveys were conducted in June 2014, which collected data from GPs and parents of infants diagnosed with CMPA in the United Kingdom. The questionnaires included quantitative and qualitative questions, which measured self-reported knowledge, management and perceived treatment progression, and the educational needs of GPs. We also explored parents’ experiences of local healthcare support in relation to CMPA. A total of 403 GPs and 300 parents completed the surveys. The main symptoms of CMPA and diagnosis period differed between GPs and parents. Other key points include different perceptions on symptom presentation and improvement, lack of awareness from GPs about current guidelines, and the significant burden on both families and GPs. This is the first study attempting to establish GP and parental experience in diagnosing CMPA. It isnotable that the difference can be improved through training, appropriate diagnostic tools and improved communication between physicians and parents.
