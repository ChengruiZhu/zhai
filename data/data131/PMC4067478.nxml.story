Rac1-GTPases serve as intermediary cellular switches which conduct transient and constitutive signals from upstream cues, including those from Ras oncoproteins. While the sirtuin1 (SIRT1) deacetylase is overexpressed in several human cancers and has recently been linked to cancer cell motility as a context-dependent regulator of multiple pathways, its role in Rac1 activation has not been reported. Likewise, SIRT2 has been demonstrated to be upregulated in some cancers; however, studies have also reported its role in tumor suppression. Here, we demonstrate that SIRT1 and SIRT2 positively regulate the levels of Rac1-GTP and the activity of T-cell lymphoma invasion and metastasis 1 (TIAM1), a Rac guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF). Transient inhibition of SIRT1 and SIRT2 resulted in increased acetylation of TIAM1 whereas chronic SIRT2 knockdown resulted in enhanced acetylation of TIAM1. SIRT1 regulates Dishevelled (DVL) protein levels in cancer cells and DVL along with TIAM1 are known to augment Rac activation; however, SIRT1 or 2 have not been previously linked with TIAM1. We found that diminished sirtuin activity led to the disruption of the DVL1-TIAM1 interaction. We hence propose a model for Rac activation where SIRT1/2 positively modulate the DVL/TIAM1/Rac axis and promote sustained pathway activation.
