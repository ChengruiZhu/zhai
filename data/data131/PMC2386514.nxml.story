The aim of this study was to evaluate the immunohistochemical expression of MUC2, MUC5AC, MUC6, and CD10 in ovarian mucinous adenoma (MA), mucinous borderline tumor (MB), and mucinous adenocarcinoma (MC), and to analyze the relationship between prognosis and these expressions. The expression of MUC2, MUC5AC, MUC6, and CD10 was evaluated by immunohistochemical analysis in 29 cases of MA, 29 cases of MB, and 26 cases of MC and scored based on the percentage of positive cells. Moreover, the ovarian mucinous tumors were classified into 4 phenotypes based on the staining patterns: intestinal, gastrointestinal, gastric, and unclassified patterns. The gastrointestinal pattern and the expression of MUC2 and CD10 increased from MA to MC. Conversely, the gastric pattern and MUC5AC expression decreased from MA to MC. Low MUC2 expression in MC was correlated with a better long-term survival rate. MUC2 expression in MC may be a useful predictor of the clinical outcome. The expression patterns of MUC2, MUC5AC, MUC6, and CD10 indicated that intestinal metaplasia may arise from the gastric-like epithelium in MA and that a close association exists between carcinogenesis and intestinal metaplasia in major ovarian mucinous tumors.
