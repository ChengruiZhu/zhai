P53 is an antitumor gene regulating vital cellular functions such as repair of DNA damage, cellular suicide, and cell proliferation: in many tumors p53 is lowly expressed and/or mutated. Drugs targeting the biomolecular network of p53 are becoming important. The network includes the key proteins Mdm2 and PTEN, whose production is regulated by p53, and which, in turn, enact positive and negative feedbacks on p53. Drug Nutlin, inhibiting the p53 inhibitor Mdm2, might be important for tumors where p53 is underproduced but unmutated. We investigate the cellular mechanism of action of Nutlin. The basic concept of our mathematical model is that the experimentally observed cell-to-cell variability of Nutlin efficacy is caused by the randomness of gene activation/deactivation of Mdmd2 and PTEN. Indeed, the abundance/scarceness of p53 regulates the probability that the relative genes are active or inactive. The model reproduced the experimental cell-specific response to different doses of Nutlin (dose-response curves) in some types of tumor cells. Much clinical research focus on 'metronomic' drug delivery regimens, where instead of giving large doses with long intervals, smaller doses are frequently delivered. In our simulations, dose-splitting of Nutlin produced a response generally worse than the response to a single dose.
