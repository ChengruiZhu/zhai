By repeatedly stimulating fine-grained patterns of neural activity, it is possible to manipulate behaviors associated with these patterns. While millimeter-scale patterns cannot yet be targeted with noninvasive brain stimulation, some people can learn to self-stimulate these activity patterns if they receive real-time feedback of their own recorded brain activity through a procedure known as fMRI neurofeedback. Other ‘non-responders’ are, for reasons unknown, unable to learn how to self-regulate these patterns. Here, we investigate how the properties of the fMRI signal, feedback timing, and self-regulation strategies may lead to this non-responder effect. The signal recorded by fMRI is related to blood flow in the brain and can be delayed by up to six seconds relative to underlying neural activity, which makes it difficult to learn. Because experiments in the MRI scanner are costly and time-consuming, we created a simulated neurofeedback environment to compare continuous versus intermittent feedback timing and cognitive versus automatic self-regulation strategies. In a cognitive experiment with human participants playing a simple game with the simulated neurofeedback signal, we found continuous feedback led to faster learning. However, in a computer model of automatic reward-based learning, we found that intermittent feedback was more reliable. These results will help improve future fMRI neurofeedback experiments and treatments by improving the efficacy of neurofeedback training procedures.
