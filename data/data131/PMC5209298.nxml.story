The prevalence of obesity is rising rapidly among Hispanics/Latinas. We evaluated the prevalence of being obese or overweight and associated risk factors among 630 low-income, Latina women from ambulatory care clinics in Upper Manhattan. Overall, 37 % of the sample was overweight and 41 % of the sample was obese, and yet, almost half of women who are overweight considered their weight “just about right.” After adjusting for socio-demographic, behavioral, and biological risk factors, being obese was strongly associated with having hypertension [relative risk ratio (RRR) 3.93, 1.75–8.82], pre-hypertension (RRR 2.59, 1.43–4.67), diabetes (RRR 2.50, 1.21–5.14) and moderate/moderately severe/severe depression (RRR 2.09, 1.03–4.26). Women who reported that finding time was a barrier to physical activity were also more likely to be obese (RRR 1.78, 1.04–3.02). Chronic financial stress was associated with lower risk of being overweight (RRR 0.47, 0.28–0.79) or obese (RRR 0.51, 0.31–0.86), as well as eating out at restaurants (RRR 0.75, 0.62–0.89). Opportunities for intervention relate to understanding cultural factors around perceptions of weight and helping women find the time for physical activity.
