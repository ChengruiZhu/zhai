The tyrosine kinase-like orphan receptor 2 (ROR2) has a wnt-mediated, pro-tumorigenic role in certain types of cancer. The present study was designed to assess the protein expression level of ROR2 and its putative ligand Wnt member 5a (Wnt5a), as well as the association with clinicopathological features in papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC). A total of 58 patients were recruited, resulting in 58 human PTC tissue samples and their paired adjacent noncancerous tissue samples being obtained. The protein expression levels of ROR2 and Wnt5a were evaluated by immunohistochemistry and western blotting, and messenger RNA expression levels were determined by reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction. ROR2 and Wnt5a protein and mRNA expression were significantly overexpressed in PTC tissues (P<0.05). The present study also revealed that ROR2 and Wnt5a were significantly associated with tumor stage and lymph node metastasis (P<0.05). There was a positive association between ROR2 and Wnt5a expression levels (r=0.857; P=0.007). In conclusion, ROR2 and Wnt5a may act as tumor suppressor genes in the development of PTC; overexpression of ROR2 and Wnt5a in PTC may be important for tumorigenesis and tumor development.
