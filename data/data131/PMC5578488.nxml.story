Echolocation is the ability to use sound-echoes to infer spatial information about the environment. It is well known from certain species of bats or marine mammals. Remarkably, some blind people have developed extraordinary proficiency in echolocation using mouth-clicks. Human echolocation work has built on scant theoretical foundations to date. The current report characterizes the transmission (i.e. mouth click) that people use for echolocation, and in this way provides data that can be used to advance the field in a theory guided way. We collected a large database of mouth clicks with three blind people expertly trained in echolocation. This allowed us to perform unprecedented analyses. Specifically, the current report provides the first ever description of the beam pattern of human expert echolocation transmissions, as well as spectro-temporal descriptions at a level of detail not available before. Based on our measurements we also propose a mathematical model to synthesize transmissions. Thus, the data are a basis to develop synthetic models of human echolocation, which are essential for understanding characteristics of click echoes and human echolocation behaviour in tasks such as localising or recognising an object, navigating around it etc.
