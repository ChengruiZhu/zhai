We investigated the effects of stress-dose HC on the mortality, CIRCI occurrence, and neurological deficits using an electrical stimulation test to assess corticosteroid response and modified neurological severity score (mNSS). We also studied pathological changes in the hypothalamus, especially in the paraventricular nuclei (PVN), after stress-dose HC or a low dose of MP was administered, including apoptosis detected by a TUNEL assay, bloodâ€“brain barrier (BBB) permeability assessed by brain water content and Evans Blue extravasation into the cerebral parenchyma, and BBB integrity evaluated by CD31 and claudin-5 expression. We made the following observations. First, 70% injured rats developed CIRCI, with a peak incidence on post-injury day 7. The TBI-associated CIRCI was closely correlated with an increased mortality and delayed neurological recovery. Second, post-injury administration of stress-dose HC, but not MP or saline increased corticosteroid response, prevented CIRCI, reduced mortality, and improved neurological function during the first 14 days post injury dosing. Thirdly, these beneficial effects were closely related to improved vascular function by the preservation of tight junctions in surviving endothelial cells, and reduced neural apoptosis in the PVN of hypothalamus.
