The dependence of acetylcholine receptor mean single-channel conductance on temperature was studied at garter snake twitch-muscle endplates using fluctuation analysis. In normal saline under conditions where most of the endplate current was carried by Na+, the channel conductance increased continuously from near 0 degrees C to approximately 23 degrees C with a Q10 of 1.97 +/- 0.14 (mean +/- SD). When 50% of the bath Na+ was replaced by either Li+, Rb+, or Cs+, the Q10 did not change significantly; however, at any temperature the channel conductance was greatest in Cs-saline and decreased with the ion sequence Cs greater than Rb greater than Na greater than Li. The results were fit by an Eyring-type model consisting of one free-energy well on the extracellular side of a single energy barrier. Ion selectivity appeared to result from ion-specific differences in the well and not in the barrier of this model. With a constant barrier enthalpy for different ions, well free-energy depth was greatest for Cs+ and graded identical to the permeability sequence. The correlation between increased well depth (i.e., ion binding) and increased channel conductance can be accounted for by the Boltzmann distribution of thermal energy.
