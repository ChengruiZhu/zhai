Comparisons between related species have shown that, over evolutionary time scales, Y-chromosomes tend to degenerate and can be completely lost. How then can we explain the persistence of Y-chromosomes to the present? One possibility is that losses are counter-balanced by the origin of new Y chromosomes, which then spread throughout the species in which they have arisen. The first of these two processes, the generation of new Y chromsomes, is more readily understood: it can occur if an autosome (a non sex chromosome) fuses with an X chromosome. This form might become established in one locality. However, its subsequent geographic spread has been more challenging to explain. Problems arise if gene flow carries them to another part of the species range. Crosses can then occur which introduce the new Y chromosome into females, who are expected to suffer reduced fitness. The new sex chromosomes are therefore selected against when they are in the minority. We use simulations to show that they can nevertheless spread, if they meet the ancestral forms at a front so the chromosomes intermingle in a hybrid zone. Paradoxically, the degeneration of the Y will actually intensify selection, thereby speeding its spread.
