In most established approaches to cognitive modelling, cognitive events are treated as ‘discrete’ states, thus passing by the continuous nature of cognitive processes. In contrast, some novel approaches explicitly acknowledge cognition’s temporal structure but provides no entry points into cognitive categorization of events and experiences. We attempt to incorporate both aspects in a new framework, which departs from the established idea that complex (human) behaviour is made up of elementary functional ‘building blocks’, referred to as modes. We model these as mathematical objects that are inherently dynamic (i.e., account for change over time). A mechanism sequentially selects the modes required and binds them together to compose complex behaviours. These modes may be subjected to brief inputs. The ensemble of these three ingredients, which influence one another and operate on different time scales, constitutes a functional architecture. We illustrate the architecture via cursive handwriting simulations, and investigate the possibility of recovering the contributions of the architecture from the written word. This appears possible only when focussing on the dynamic modes.
