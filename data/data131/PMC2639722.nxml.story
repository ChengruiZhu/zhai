Pitch is one of the most important features of natural sounds. The pitch sensation depends strongly on its temporal context, as happens, for example, in the perception of melody in music and prosody in speech. However, the temporal dynamics of pitch processing are poorly understood. Perceptual studies have shown that there is apparently a wide range of time scales over which pitch-related information is integrated. This multiplicity in perceptual time scales requires a trade-off between temporal resolution and temporal integration, which is not exclusive to pitch perception but applies to auditory perception in general. As far as we are aware, no existing model can account simultaneously for the wide range and stimulus-dependent nature of the perceptual phenomenology. This article presents a neurocomputational model, which explains the temporal resolutionâ€“integration trade-off observed in pitch perception in a unified fashion. The main contribution of this work is to propose that top-down, efferent mechanisms are crucial for pitch processing. The model replicates perceptual responses in a wide range of perceptual experiments not simultaneously accounted for by previous approaches. Moreover, it accounts quantitatively for the stimulus-dependent latency of the pitch onset response measured in the auditory cortex.
