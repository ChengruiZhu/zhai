 (HTA) is to provide decision-makers, distributors and recipients with information on the effectiveness, cost and impact of health technologies. The present study constitutes a subproject within the wider project “Analysis of the impact of professional involvement in evidence generation for the HTA process”, which is part of the strategic programme “Transfer of the results of the research in clinical practice and organisation of healthcare services”, coordinated by Laziosanità – Agency of Public Healthcare of the Lazio Region and AgeNaS (National Agency for Regional Healthcare Services). The objectives of the present subproject (cochlear implants) are as follows: a) to produce a report regarding the health impact of cochlear implants (CI) on their recipients, through a systematic review of literature and extensive selection of relative studies, combining the outcomes with metanalytical techniques. Output: report on the indications of usage in the groups of population for which benefits are controversial; b) to create a registry of patients using cochlear implants. The registry should contain a selection of anagraphic and clinical information relative to patient follow-up in order to assess factors associated with safety and impact on cochlear implant users. This source of information is essential for future observational studies. This was divided into 4 phases: 1
