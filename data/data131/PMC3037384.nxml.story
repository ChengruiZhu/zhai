Binding of transcription factors to promoters of genes, and subsequent enhancement or repression of transcription, is one of the main steps of transcriptional gene regulation. Direct or indirect wet-lab experiments allow the identification of approximate regions potentially bound or regulated by a transcription factor. Subsequently, de-novo motif discovery tools can be used for detecting the precise positions of binding sites. Many traditional tools focus on motifs over-represented in the target regions, which often turn out to be similarly over-represented in the entire genome. In contrast, several recent tools focus on differentially abundant motifs in target regions compared to a control set. As binding sites are often located at some preferred distance to the transcription start site, it is favorable to include this information into de-novo motif discovery. Here, we present Dispom a novel approach for learning differentially abundant motifs and their positional preferences simultaneously, which predicts binding sites with increased accuracy compared to many popular de-novo motif discovery tools. When applying Dispom to promoters of auxin-responsive genes of Arabidopsis thaliana, we find a binding motif slightly different from the canonical auxin-response element, which exhibits a strong positional preference and which is considerably more specific to auxin-responsive genes.
