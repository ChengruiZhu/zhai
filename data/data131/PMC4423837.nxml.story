All living organisms face constant challenges from environmental factors. Appropriate and rapid responses to external stimuli are crucial for maintenance of genome integrity and cell survival. Poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation is a post-translational modification and contributes to multiple molecular and cellular processes including a prominent role in DNA damage repair. Human PARP1, the founding and most characterized member of the PARP family, accounts for more than 90% of overall molecular and cellular PARP activity in response to DNA damage while PARP2 supplies a minor portion of this PARP activity. Here we show that Arabidopsis PARP2 rather than PARP1 plays the predominant role in poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation and organismal resilience in response to either chemically-induced DNA damage or pathogen infections. We show that the activity and abundance of PARP2 is regulated by both PARP1 and PARG1. We also show that Arabidopsis PARG1 rather than PARG2 is the major contributor to removal poly(ADP-ribose) from acceptor proteins. Core aspects of plant poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation are mediated by substantially different enzymes than in animals, suggesting the likelihood of substantial differences in regulation.
