Gastric cancer is one of the most common cancers and has the highest mortality rate worldwide. It is worthwhile to explore the mechanism of gastric cancer progression. An increasing number of studies have found that non-coding RNAs including miRNA and lncRNA play important roles in gastric cancer progression. This review summarized the role of ectopic miRNA in gastric cancer proliferation, growth, migration, invasion and apoptosis. Meantime, aberrantly expressed miRNA also received a great deal of attention as potential biomarker for gastric cancer diagnosis and therapy. Over the last decade, lncRNA was considered to regulate gastric cancer progression at the transcript and post-transcript level. At the transcript level, lncRNA induced gastric cancer progression by changing chromatin modification and mRNA stabilization to regulate mRNA and miRNA expression. Furthermore, lncRNA regulated gastric cancer progression by completely combining with miRNA to produce ceRNA or promote protein stabilization at the post-transcript level. Greater attention of miRNA and lncRNA in gastric cancer can provide new insight of mechanism of cancer development and may be acted as a new anticancer target.
