Although inflammatory polyposis is one of the common complications in patients with inflammatory bowel disease, it is rare that each poly grows up to more than 1.5 cm. We describe a case of localized giant inflammatory polyposis of the ileocecum associated with Crohn's disease. A 40-year-old man who had been followed for 28 years because of Crohn's disease was hospitalized for right lower abdominal pain after meals. Barium enema and colonoscopy showed numerous worm-like polyps in the ascending colon which grew up to the hepatic flexure of the colon from the ileocecum, causing an obstruction of the ileocecal orifice. Since histology of a biopsy specimen taken from the giant polyps showed no dysplasia, he was diagnosed with ileus due to the localized giant inflammatory polyposis. A laparoscopically assisted ileocecal resection was performed. The resected specimen showed that the giant polyps grew up into the ileocecum. Histological examination revealed inflammatory polyposis without neoplasm. Generally, conservative treatment is indicated for localized giant inflammatory polyposis because this lesion is regarded as benign. However, occasionally serious complications arise, requiring surgical treatment.
