The aim of this study is to identify intra-articular pathology and loose bodies during arthroscopic examination of young patients after hip dislocation and to correlate arthroscopic findings with preoperative imaging. Twelve hips in 12 patients (eight males, four females; mean age 16.3 years, range 11–25 years) underwent hip arthroscopy after traumatic hip dislocation. Medical records, imaging studies and intra-operative images were reviewed to determine the damage to the hip joint, acetabular morphology, including labral and/or cartilage injury and presence of loose bodies. Imaging findings were compared with arthroscopic findings and treatment. All 12 patients underwent arthroscopy, which was performed an average of 59 (range 1–359, median 17.5) days after dislocation. Ten patients had posterior hip dislocations and two patients had obturator dislocations. All patients underwent closed reduction as initial management, with one incongruent reduction. Eleven patients had computed tomography scans and four patients had magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with three patients having both modalities. Loose bodies were identified in 6/12 (50%) patients on pre-operative imaging and in 8/12 (67%) patients at arthroscopy. The two patients with unidentified loose bodies on imaging did not have a preoperative MRI. Five patients had acetabular cartilage injuries and three patients had femoral-sided cartilage injuries. Eight patients had labral injuries at arthroscopy. Intra-articular injuries and loose bodies are common in adolescent and young adult patients undergoing arthroscopy following traumatic hip dislocation. Further studies are needed to determine whether arthroscopy after traumatic dislocation may play a role in hip preservation following these injuries.
