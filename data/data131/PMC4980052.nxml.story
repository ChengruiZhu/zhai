Incidence rates measure the transitions between the states of noninfected to infected per unit of time and per person at risk. Usually calculated from longitudinal observations, they provide an indication of how rapidly a disease develops in a population over time. In the context of malaria, longitudinal data on infection status are obtained through consecutive survey rounds, separated by a certain time interval. Depending on the length of the interval, some changes of infection status may be missed, and thus only uncensored information would be available. Methodology to calculate incidence rates from this type of data was first proposed in 1976, but its assumptions were not applicable to low transmission settings, particularly in the presence of control measures. No alternative methodology has been proposed in the past 40 years, limiting attempts to obtain estimates of incidence rates in the current scenario of declining malaria transmission worldwide. In this paper we address this gap and introduce new methodology to estimate malaria incidence rates from longitudinal data that can be applied to settings with any transmission level. We provide a complete example of the method, including sensitivity analysis, and an assessment of possible differences between data based on microscopy vs. PCR diagnostics. To facilitate replication and wide use of the method, we make available a programming code in R language and the example dataset.
