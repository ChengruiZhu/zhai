 (i) the width of the anterior horn (AH) and posterior horn (PH) of the acetabulum; (ii) the inclination of the articular surface of the AH angle (AHA) and PH angle (PHA) in the axial plane; (iii) the anterior opening angle of the IA and differences between genders. One hundred and fifty adult skeletons were utilized in this study. Measurements were taken directly from acetabula in 300 innominate bones utilizing digital calipers. In sequence, the innominate bones were assembled to sacrum and 150 pelvises were digitally photographed in standardized positions. Angular parameters of the acetabulum were then measured utilizing the Adobe Photoshop software. The mean width of the AH was 14.80 ± 2.35 mm (range 9.44–20.88). The mean width of the PH was 19.72 ± 2.61 mm (range 13.16–25.86). The AHA was on average 43.58 ± 7.10° (range 24.70–64) and the PHA was on average 36.07 ± 7.54° (16.10–53.20). The mean anterior opening angle of the IA was 25.33 ± 5.40° (10.90–43.10). The IA morphology can be evaluated in all anatomical planes through quantitative parameters. The assessment of the osseous morphology of the IA is the first step to elucidate abnormalities of the IA as potential source of hip pain.
