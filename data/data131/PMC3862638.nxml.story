Ewing’s sarcoma (EWS) is a pediatric cancer that is conventionally treated by surgery, chemotherapy, and radiation therapy. Innovative immunotherapies to treat EWS are currently under development. Unfortunately for EWS patients, when the disease is found to be resistant to current therapeutic approaches, the prognosis is predictably grim. Radiation therapy and immunotherapy could potentially synergize in the eradication of EWS, as some studies have previously shown that irradiation increases the presence of immune receptors, including MHC class I molecules, on the surface of tumor cells. However, EWS cells have been reported to express low levels of MHC class I molecules, a phenotype that would inhibit T-cell mediated lysis. We have previously demonstrated that the transgene-driven overexpression of amyloid β (A4) precursor-like protein 2 (APLP2) reduces the expression of MHC class I molecules on the surface of human cervical carcinoma HeLa cells. We thus examined whether endogenously expressed APLP2 downregulates MHC class I expression on EWS cells, particularly upon irradiation. We found that irradiation induces the relocalization of APLP2 and MHC class I molecules on the surface of EWS cells, redistributing cells from subpopulations with relatively low APLP2 and high MHC class I into subpopulations with relatively high APLP2 and low MHC class I surface expression. Consistent with these findings, the transfection of an APLP2-targeting siRNA into EWS cells increased MHC class I expression on the cell surface. Furthermore, APLP2 was found by co-immunoprecipitation to bind to MHC class I molecules. Taken together, these findings suggest that APLP2 inhibits MHC class I expression on the surface of irradiated EWS cells by a mechanism that involves APLP2/MHC class I interactions. Thus, therapeutic strategies that limit APLP2 expression may boost the ability of T cells to recognize and eradicate EWS in patients.
