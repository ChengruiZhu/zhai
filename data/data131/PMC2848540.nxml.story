Genetic networks display exceedingly complex and rich behavior which is modulated by multiple mechanisms, including many diverse types of interactions between DNA, mRNA and protein molecules. Mathematical models of gene networks must necessarily consider the essential mechanistic details of the processes involved in order to make reliable predictions. However, even though the description of the process becomes more accurate as more mechanistic details are incorporated into the mathematical model, the added mathematical complexity will make it difficult to parameterize and extract information from such models given the limited amount of experimental data. Protein synthesis is precisely one of the phases in the network machinery where certain mechanistic details are important and should thus be taken into account. Here, we develop a methodology to reduce a mathematical model for protein synthesis by performing approximations on a mechanistic model, retaining the essential details of the process. Our methodology opens up the possibility of utilizing powerful mathematical tools, such as bifurcation analysis, for understanding the complex dynamics displayed by genetic networks and design strategies for metabolic engineering and synthetic biology.
