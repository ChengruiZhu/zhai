 approaches and cultured breast cancer cell lines we demonstrate that Fibulin-2 is a better substrate for ADAMTS-5 than it is for ADAMTS-4. Moreover, Fibulin-2 degradation is associated to an enhancement of the invasive potential of T47D, MCF-7 and SK-BR-3 cells. We have also found that conditioned medium from MCF-7 cells that simultaneously overexpress Fibulin-2 and ADAMTS-5 significantly induced the migratory and invasive ability of normal breast fibroblasts using 3D collagen matrices. Immunohistochemical analysis highlights the close proximity or partial overlap of both Fibulin-2 and ADAMTS-5 in breast tumor samples. Additionally, proteolytic products derived from a potential degradation of Fibulin-2 by ADAMTS-5 were also identified in these samples. Finally, we also show that the cleavage of Fibulin-2 by ADAMTS-5 is counteracted by ADAMTS-12, a metalloprotease that interacts with Fibulin-2. Overall, our results provide direct evidence indicating that Fibulin-2 is a novel substrate of ADAMTS-5 and that this proteolysis could alter the cellular microenvironment affecting the balance between protumor and antitumor effects associated to both Fibulin-2 and the ADAMTSs metalloproteases.
