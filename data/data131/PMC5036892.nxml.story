The HIV epidemic continues to be a severe public health problem within the USA and many parts of the world. A substantial number of HIV-infected individuals are intravenous drug users who abuse opiates. Drugs of abuse lead not only to high HIV transmission, but also to high viral load, increased disease progression, and augmented HIV-associated neurocognitive disorder in HIV-1 infected individuals. In this study, using a novel mathematical model and experimental data from macaques, we evaluate some important effects of morphine, an active metabolite of heroin, on simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) dynamics. In particular, we quantify the morphine-induced target cell subpopulation switch that results in a high proportion of target cells with higher susceptibility to SIV infection. Consistent with experimental observations, our results reveal that morphine promotes increased co-receptor expression, which can increase the rate of target cell infection. This in turn may explain the observation that HIV infected individuals with drugs of abuse may suffer from higher viral load, higher CD4 count loss, a larger basic reproduction number, and higher probability of failing antiretroviral therapy. Our model and results may be useful to formulate guidelines on incorporating extra efforts needed to manage HIV infection in drug abusers.
