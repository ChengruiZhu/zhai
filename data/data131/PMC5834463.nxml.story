Astrocytic JWA exerts neuroprotective roles by alleviating oxidative stress and inhibiting inflammation. However, the molecular mechanisms of how astrocytic JWA is involved in dopaminergic neurodegeneration in Parkinsonâ€™s disease (PD) remain largely unknown. In this study, we found that astrocyte-specific JWA knockout mice (JWA CKO) exacerbated dopamine (DA) neuronal loss and motor dysfunction, and reduced the levels of DA and its metabolites in a 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1, 2, 3, 6-tetrahydropyridine/probenecid (MPTP/p)-induced PD model. Astrocytic JWA deficiency repressed expression of excitatory amino-acid transporter 2 (GLT-1) and glutamate uptake both in vivo and in vitro. Further, the regulation of GLT-1 expression was involved in JWA-triggered activation of the MAPK and PI3K signaling pathways. JWA-increased GLT-1 expression was abolished by inhibitors of MEK and PI3K. Silencing CREB also abrogated JWA-increased GLT-1 expression and glutamate uptake. Additionally, JWA deficiency activated glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), and increased the expression of STAT3. Similarly to the MPTP model, paraquat (PQ) exposure produced PD-like phenotypes in JWA CKO mice. Taken together, our findings provide novel insights into astrocytic JWA function in the pathogenesis of neurotoxin mouse models of PD.
