The regulation of energy balance requires a complex system to homeostatically maintain the adult body at a precise set point. The central nervous system, particularly the hypothalamus, plays a key role in integrating a variety of signals that can relay information about the bodyâ€™s energy stores. As part of this system, numerous cytokines and hormones contribute to the regulation of food intake and energy homeostasis. Cytokines, and some hormones, are known to act through JAK-STAT intracellular signaling pathways. The hormone leptin, which plays a vital role in appetite regulation, signals through the JAK-STAT pathway, and it is through this involvement that the JAK-STAT pathway has become an established component in the mechanisms regulating food intake within the body. Emerging research, however, is now showing that this involvement of JAK-STAT is not limited to its activation by leptin. Furthermore, while the JAK-STAT pathway may simply act to transmit the anorectic signal of circulating factors, this intracellular signaling pathway may also become impaired when normal regulation of energy balance is disrupted. Thus, altered JAK-STAT signaling may contribute to the breakdown of the normal homeostatic mechanisms maintaining body weight in obesity.
