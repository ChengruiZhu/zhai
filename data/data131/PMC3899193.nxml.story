 is driven by tightly regulated pathways, leading to actomyosin ring contraction coupled to plasma membrane constriction and to centripetal growth of the primary septum, respectively. These pathways can partially substitute for each other, but their concomitant inactivation leads to cytokinesis block and cell death. Here we show that both the lack of the functionally redundant FHA-RING ubiquitin ligases Dma1 and Dma2 and moderate Dma2 overproduction affect actomyosin ring contraction as well as primary septum deposition, although they do not apparently alter cell cycle progression of otherwise wild-type cells. In addition, overproduction of Dma2 impairs the interaction between Tem1 and Iqg1, which is thought to be required for AMR contraction, and causes asymmetric primary septum deposition as well as mislocalization of the Cyk3-positive regulator of this process. In agreement with these multiple inhibitory effects, a Dma2 excess that does not cause any apparent defect in wild-type cells leads to lethal cytokinesis block in cells lacking the Hof1 protein, which is essential for primary septum formation in the absence of Cyk3. Altogether, these findings suggest that the Dma proteins act as negative regulators of cytokinesis.
