Two studies in healthy subjects assessed the absorption of edoxaban when delivered to specific locations within the gastrointestinal tract using Enterion capsules. In study 1 (single‐dose, 4‐way crossover), 8 participants received edoxaban 60 mg as immediate‐release (IR) tablets (treatment A), as powder formulation delivered to the distal small bowel (treatment B) or ascending colon (treatment C), or as an aqueous suspension delivered to the ascending colon (treatment D). In study 2 (single‐dose, 2‐way crossover), 10 participants received edoxaban 30 mg as IR tablets (treatment E) or in granulate formulation with fumaric acid 50 mg, added to acidify the local gastrointestinal tract and enhance solubility, delivered to the ascending colon (treatment F). Peak and total exposure following targeted drug delivery to the distal gastrointestinal tract were significantly lower than with IR tablet delivery. In study 1, total exposure ratios of treatments B, C, and D compared with A were 14.9%, 7.9%, and 6.1%, respectively. In study 2, relative total exposure was 12.6% for treatment F despite the fumaric acid. Time to peak concentration was longer with higher variability for edoxaban delivered to the distal gastrointestinal tract compared with the IR tablet. These data indicate that edoxaban absorption occurs predominantly in the proximal small intestine.
