Antiseptic agents can cause skin irritation and lead to severe problems, especially for individuals with atopic diatheses. We investigated the effect of 4 different antiseptic agents using an atopic dermatitis (AD) model mouse. NC/Nga mice were subcutaneously injected with mite allergen (Dp) to induce AD-like skin lesions (ADSLs), and an application of 0.2% (w/v) benzalkonium chloride (BZK), 10% (w/v) povidone-iodine (PVP-I), 80% (v/v) ethanol (Et-OH), or 0.5% (v/v) chlorhexidine gluconate (CHG) was applied to the ear envelope. BZK induced a significant increase in the severity of the clinical score, infiltration of inflammatory cells, local expression of inflammatory cytokines in subcutaneous tissue, and total serum immunoglobulin (Ig) E. PVP-I increased the clinical score, number of mast cells, and production of inflammatory cytokines, and total serum IgE. Et-OH increased the clinical score and number of inflammatory cells, but showed no effect on serum IgE levels. No differences in any parameters were observed between CHG and the vehicle. Collectively, the results suggest the severity of the ADSL was related in part to the strength of the immunoreaction. These findings suggest that CHG could offer the lowest risk of inducing ADSL in individuals with atopic dermatitis and that medical staff and food handlers with AD could benefit from its use.
