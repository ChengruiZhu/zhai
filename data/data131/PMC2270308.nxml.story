Recent studies have reported major changes in mature tropical forests, with increases in both forest biomass and net primary productivity, as well as shifts in plant species composition that favour fast-growing species over slow-growing ones. These pervasive alterations were attributed to global environmental change, and may result in dramatic shifts in the functioning of tropical forest ecosystems. We reassessed these findings using a dataset of large permanent forest plots on three continents. We found that tree biomass increased at seven of our ten plots, and showed a large decrease at a single plot. Overall, this increase was significant, albeit lower than reported previously for Amazonian forests. At three sites for which we had data for multiple census intervals, we found no concerted increase in biomass gain, in conflict with the increased productivity hypothesis. With the exception of one plot, slow-growing species gained more biomass than either fast-growing species or the tree community as a whole. Hence, our results do not support the hypothesis that fast-growing species are consistently increasing in dominance in tropical tree communities. Overall, our results suggest that our plots may be simultaneously recovering from past disturbances and affected by changes in resource availability.
