Occlusive coronary artery disease coexisting with Buerger's disease has rarely been reported. Potential difficulties regarding diagnostic workup and therapeutic management in this group of patients are discussed through this case report. We present an interesting case of a 52-year-old patient suffering from Buerger's disease, with a history of generalized peripheral occlusive arteriopathy, who presented with acute coronary syndrome. A difficulty in accessing and performing coronary angiography was evident due to the vascular status of the patient. Diagnosis was performed by computed tomography (CT) of the coronary arteries. It showed 80â€“90% obstruction of the LAD, and since percutaneous coronary intervention was impossible, a single aortocoronary bypass grafting was performed with the off-pump technique. Coronary artery disease coexisting with Burger's disease is a rare entity, and CT angiography is a useful diagnostic tool, when the classic angiography could not be performed. In addition, off-pump coronary artery bypass should be the therapeutic option of choice in this high risk group of patients. The uncomplicated postoperative course of the patient and his hitherto good condition showed that both diagnostic and therapeutic procedures were the best possible.
