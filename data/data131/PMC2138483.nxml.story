) mitotic blocking agents do not affect release of antibody by cells in interphase. Cell cycle times, based on the extent of reduction of plaque-forming cells per unit time of drug treatment, were estimated using a mathematical model appropriate for an exponentially increasing population of cells. Cell cycle times estimated using the mitotic blocking agents agreed well with cell doubling times calculated from the increase in plaque-forming cells occurring 1â€“4 days after immunization. Increased responses produced by higher antigen doses or treatment of immunized animals with an adjuvant resulted from an increased rate of division of responding cells and their progeny. The results are consistent with a cell selection theory of antibody formation. Antigenic stimulation causes relatively few cells to proliferate and to synthesize antibody; apparently the magnitude of the response is dependent primarily on the rate of division of responding cells. It is suggested on the basis of observations of in vitro-immunized cell cultures that the rate of division of responding cells may be dependent on the rate of interaction between two cell types, both of which are essential for the in vitro plaque-forming cell response.
