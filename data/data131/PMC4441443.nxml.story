In general, proteins become functional once they fold into a specific globular structure. On folding, hydrophobic amino acids get buried inside the protein such that they are shielded from the water; this hydrophobic effect makes a protein fold stable. However, the strength of the hydrophobicity is known to be strongly temperature dependent, leading for example to lower stability at lower temperatures (cold denaturation). Nevertheless, it is difficult to quantify the temperature dependence for hydrophobic amino acids. Here we are able to estimate the strength of the hydrophobic effect, by analysing the positions of a large number of amino acids from protein structures experimentally determined at different temperatures. For each amino acid type, we use the ratio between the number of residues at the inside and at the surface of the folded structures as a measure for its hydrophobicity. This approach shows that the hydrophobic effect becomes weaker at lower temperatures, as expected from theoretical predictions. Understanding the temperature dependence for amino acids, can help to make proteins (or enzymes) stable at a specific temperature range. For example, the design of enzymes that are stable and functional at low temperatures may benefit from this work.
