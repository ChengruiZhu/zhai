Functional imaging based on tomographic X-ray imaging relies on the reconstruction of a temporal sequence of images which accurately reproduces the time attenuation curves of the tissue. The main constraints of these techniques are temporal resolution and dose. Using current techniques the data acquisition has to be performed fast so that the dynamic attenuation values can be regarded as static during the scan. Due to the relatively high number of repeated scans the dose per single scan has to be low yielding a poor signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) in the reconstructed images. In a previous publication a temporal interpolation scheme in the projection data space was relaxing the temporal resolution constraint. The aim of this contribution is the improvement of the SNR. A temporal smoothing term is introduced in the temporal interpolation scheme such that only the physiologic relevant bandwidth is considered. A significant increase of the SNR is achieved. The obtained level of noise only depends on the total dose applied and
is independent of the number of scans and the SNR of a single reconstructed image. The
approach might be the first step towards using slowly rotating CT systems for perfusion imaging like C-arm or small animal CT scanners.
