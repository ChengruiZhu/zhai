To elucidate the veritable relationship between three hMLH1 polymorphisms (rs1800734, rs1799977, rs63750447) and cancer risk, we performed this meta-analysis based on overall published data up to May 2017, from PubMed, Web of knowledge, VIP, WanFang and CNKI database, and the references of the original studies or review articles. 57 publications including 31,484 cancer cases and 45,494 cancer-free controls were obtained. The quality assessment of six articles obtained a summarized score less than 6 in terms of the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale (NOS). All statistical analyses were calculated with the software STATA (Version 14.0; Stata Corp, College Station, TX). We found all the three polymorphisms can enhance overall cancer risk, especially in Asians, under different genetic comparisons. In the subgroup analysis by cancer type, we found a moderate association between rs1800734 and the risk of gastric cancer (allele model: OR = 1.14, P = 0.017; homozygote model: OR = 1.33, P = 0.019; dominant model: OR = 1.27, P = 0.024) and lung cancer in recessive model (OR = 1.27, P = 0.024). The G allele of rs1799977 polymorphism was proved to connect with susceptibility of colorectal cancer (allele model: OR = 1.21, P = 0.023; dominate model: OR = 1.32, P <0.0001) and prostate cancer (dominate model: OR = 1.36, P <0.0001). Rs63750447 showed an increased risk of colorectal cancer, endometrial cancer and gastric cancer under all genetic models. These findings provide evidence that hMLH1 polymorphisms may associate with cancer risk, especially in Asians.
