The aim of this case report is to discuss issues related to management of one eyed pregnant female. A 26-year-old female (Patient A) and 28-year-old female (Patient B) both in second trimester and one eyed presented to our outpatient department with diminution of vision due to rhegmatogenous retinal detachment (RRD). Retina was attached in Patient A following scleral buckling surgery but Patient B required pars plana vitrectomy with silicon oil tamponade. Best corrected visual acuity in both patients did improve from 1/60 to 6/24 and 6/18, respectively at 6 months follow-up. Exudative RDs are known to occur in pregnancy as a complication of preeclampsia, but RRD in pregnancy although co-incidental poses certain challenge with regard to management of such cases especially if the patient is one-eyed. Things to consider for management include (1) type of anesthesia (2) surgical positioning (3) positioning after surgery (4) anti-glaucoma medication if required (5) corticosteroid treatment in pregnancy (6) to provide them ambulatory vision as early as possible. With proper management and monitoring it is possible to provide them with early ambulatory vision without offering any harm to her pregnancy and fetus.
