Compliance is a key factor in the maintenance treatment of bipolar disorder. This noninterventional study was conducted to explore factors associated with higher levels of compliance in bipolar patients, all treated in routine clinical settings. Bipolar outpatients (Clinical Global Impression of Severity score ≤3) who had been stabilized with olanzapine mono- or combination therapy for ≥4 weeks were enrolled in the study. Compliance to medication was assessed at baseline and after 3, 6, 9, 12, 18, and 24 months by a physician-rated, 4-point categorical scale using the following classification: noncompliant (patients being compliant to treatment schedule less than 20% of the time) and low (20% to 59% of the time), moderate (60% to 79% of the time), and high (≥80% of the time) levels of compliance. Both baseline and post-baseline factors were used in a generalized estimating equations (GEE) model to predict the likelihood of high compliance. Of 891 eligible patients, 657 patients completed the 24-month observation period. High levels of compliance (≥80%) were observed in 67% of patients at baseline, increasing to 80% in study completers. High compliance at baseline was identified as a strong predictor of compliance during study participation (odds ratio (OR) = 6.9, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 5.0 to 9.5,
