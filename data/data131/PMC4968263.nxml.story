Ten fresh-frozen cadaveric knees were placed on a custom testing fixture, with a fixed femur and tibia mobile through 120 degrees of flexion. The quadriceps tendon was loaded with 10.8 N in an anatomic direction using a weighted pulley system. A 0.2 N patellar lateral displacement load was used to simulate an intact lateral retinaculum to avoid over-medializing the patella. A tunnel was drilled under fluoroscopic guidance from Schottleâ€™s point on the medial distal femur through the lateral cortex. A suture anchor was placed at the upper 66% of the medial border of the patella and the sutures were shuttled through to the lateral side and attached to a pulley with a 1 N weight. Retroreflective markers were attached to the femur, tibia, patella, and suture. MPFL length change, as measured by suture marker motion, was assessed using a 3D motion capture system through a range of motion between 0 deg and 110 deg with the native TT anatomy. Recordings were repeated after a flat TT osteotomy and transfer to a TT-TG of 20 mm and 25 mm and a C/D ratio of 1.2 and 1.4, including all combinations. Generalized estimating equation (GEE) modeling technique was used to analyze and control for the clustered nature of the data. SAS version 9.3 (SAS Inc., Cary, NC) was used for all data analyses.
