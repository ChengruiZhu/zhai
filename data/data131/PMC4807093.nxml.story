Brutonâ€™s tyrosine kinase (Btk) belongs to the Tec family of protein tyrosine kinases, and plays a crucial role in the signaling pathway in B-cells. Alteration of Btk activity results in the serious immunological disorder, X-linked agammaglobulinemia. Btk is a multi-domain protein and the activity of the kinase domain is regulated by the adjacent non-catalytic domains, which mediate their effect by means of a conserved tryptophan residue. In this work, we have investigated the mechanism of regulation by this tryptophan residue, W395, in the linker preceding the Btk kinase domain. Using hydrogen-deuterium exchange mass spectrometry and molecular dynamics simulations we identify structural elements within the kinase domain that are required for function by transmitting the allosteric effects of W395. Molecular Dynamics simulations further guided us to delineate the kinase domain into dynamically correlated sets of residues using community analysis, thereby identifying the important communication nodes that connect the various elements of the kinase domain required for function. The analyses performed indicate clearly how the W395A mutant changes the communication pathway required for function.
