As the central hub of cell metabolism, the mammalian target of rapamycin complex (mTORC) integrates immune signals and metabolic cues for the maintenance and activation of these systems. Rictor is the core component of the mammalian target of rapamycin complex 2 (mTORC2), and loss of this protein leads to an immunodeficiency that involves (among other things) impaired antibody production. B cell receptor (BCR) signaling is critical for antibody generation and although it has been shown that loss of Rictor in B cells negatively impacts this function, the underlying molecular mechanisms are unknown. Here, we show that both early and distal BCR signaling is reduced in Rictor knockout (KO) B cells. We find that the reduction in BCR signaling stems from defective clustering of BCRs during early B cell activation. This seems to be caused by the uncontrolled activation of the actin-connecting protein ezrin, which leads to a rigid actin fence that restricts the lateral movement of BCRs in the membrane. Interestingly, treatment of Rictor KO mice with an actin inhibitor rescues the BCR signaling. Our findings suggest that Rictor helps to allow effective BCR signaling in B cells by triggering reorganization of the actin network, thereby enabling an appropriate antibody response during infection.
