; p=0,412). Group A patients experienced longer exposure to cART (10 vs 8 years; p<0,05) and have undergone, on average, 3 previous regimens (p<0,05). With regard to cARV current regimen: 32,1% patients in group A and 30,3% in group B were prescribed non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors based regimes and 51,3% patients in Group A and 59,6% in group B were under cARV based on Protease inhibitors. The identified causes of virologic failure for patients with detectable HIV RNA were: poor adherence (54%); unsuccessful retention in care (14,4%); sporadic detectable HIV RNA (40≤viral load<200), “blips” (14,4%); mutations of resistance to ARVs (13,4%); intolerance to the current regimen (2,1%) and pharmacokinetics drug interactions (1,6%). The estimated rate of virological failure was 10,1% in this population. Insufficient adherence and unsuccessful retention in care were identified in 68,4% of treatment failed patients as main causes of virological failure. Failure of therapy due to intolerance or adverse effects was reported in 2,1% of cases, reflecting a better safety profile and tolerability of recent prescribed regimens. Early identification of causes of virologic failure, timely adjustment of therapeutic regimens, and the adoption of measures to promote adherence and retention in care are key factors for successful treatment of HIV-infected patients.
