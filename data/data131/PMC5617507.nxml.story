Tumor-infiltrating immune cells are a pivotal component of the tumor microenvironment (TME), but their indicative role remains poorly defined. A meta-analysis was performed to reveal the prognostic efficiency of tumor-infiltrating immune cells in gastric cancer (GC). By searching PubMed and Embase, we identified a total of 35 eligible articles that involved 4888 patients. Random or fixed effect models were employed to extract pooled hazard ratios (HRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Our results indicated that high CD3+ lymphocyte infiltration in all the locations (AG), the tumor nest (TN), and the tumor stroma (TS) predicted better overall survival (OS) (HR=0.71, 95% CI=0.57-0.90; HR=0.58, 95% CI=0.42-0.80; and HR=0.50, 95% CI=0.37-0.68, respectively). CD8+ T cell infiltration in AG and FoxP3+ regulatory T cells (Tregs) in the tumor invasive margin (TM) were also associated with improved OS (HR=0.90, 95% CI=0.83-0.97; HR=0.65, 95% CI=0.48-0.87, respectively). However, contrasting results were found in the macrophage subset, with M2 in AG (HR=1.45, 95% CI=1.13-1.86) and the TN (HR=1.67, 95% CI=1.12-2.48) associated with worse OS. In summary, the combination of the densities and locations of tumor-infiltrating immune cells can be useful for predicting survival for GC patients, but additional research is needed to reinforce the reliability of this studyâ€™s conclusions.
