The risk of local recurrence (LR), distant metastases (DM) and overall survival (OS) of locally advanced rectal cancer after preoperative chemoradiation can be estimated by prediction models and visualized using nomograms, which have been trained and validated in European clinical trial populations. Data of 277 consecutive locally advanced rectal adenocarcinoma patients treated with preoperative chemoradiation and surgery from Shanghai Cancer Center, were retrospectively collected and used for external validation. Concordance index (C-index) and calibration curves were used to assess the performance of the previously developed prediction models in this routine clinical validation population. The C-index for the published prediction models was 0.72 ± 0.079, 0.75 ± 0.043 and 0.72 ± 0.089 in predicting 2-year LR, DM and OS in the Chinese population, respectively. Kaplan-Meier curves indicated good discriminating performance regarding LR, but could not convincingly discriminate a low-risk and medium-risk group for distant control and OS. Calibration curves showed a trend of underestimation of local and distant control, as well as OS in the observed data compared with the estimates predicted by the model.
