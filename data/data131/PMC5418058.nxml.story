Structural differentiation of bacterial chromatin depends on cooperative binding of abundant nucleoid-associated proteins at numerous genomic DNA sites and stabilization of distinct long-range nucleoprotein structures. Histone-like nucleoid-structuring protein (H-NS) is an abundant DNA-bridging, nucleoid-associated protein that binds to an AT-rich conserved DNA sequence motif and regulates both the shape and the genetic expression of the bacterial chromosome. Although there is ample evidence that the mode of H-NS binding depends on environmental conditions, the role of the spatial organization of H-NS-binding sequences in the assembly of long-range nucleoprotein structures remains unknown. In this study, by using high-resolution atomic force microscopy combined with biochemical assays, we explored the formation of H-NS nucleoprotein complexes on circular DNA molecules having different arrangements of identical sequences containing high-affinity H-NS-binding sites. We provide the first experimental evidence that variable sequence arrangements result in various three-dimensional nucleoprotein structures that differ in their shape and the capacity to constrain supercoils and compact the DNA. We believe that the DNA sequence-directed versatile assembly of periodic higher-order structures reveals a general organizational principle that can be exploited for knowledge-based design of long-range nucleoprotein complexes and purposeful manipulation of the bacterial chromatin architecture.
