In recent years, more and more non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) have been identified and increasing evidences have shown that ncRNAs may affect gene expression and disease progression, making them a new class of targets for drug discovery. It thus becomes important to understand the relationship between ncRNAs and drug targets. For this purpose, an ncRNAs and drug targets association database would be extremely beneficial. Here, we developed ncRNA Drug Targets Database (NRDTD) that collected 165 entries of clinically or experimentally supported ncRNAs as drug targets, including 97 ncRNAs and 96 drugs. Moreover, we annotated ncRNA-drug target associations with drug information from KEGG, PubChem, DrugBank, CTD or Wikipedia, GenBank sequence links, OMIM disease ID, pathway and function annotation for ncRNAs, detailed description of associations between ncRNAs and diseases from HMDD or LncRNADisease and the publication PubMed ID. Additionally, we provided users a link to submit novel disease-ncRNA-drug associations and corresponding supporting evidences into the database. We hope NRDTD will be a useful resource for investigating the roles of ncRNAs in drug target identification, drug discovery and disease treatment.
