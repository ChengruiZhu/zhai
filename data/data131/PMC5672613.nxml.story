, respectively related to osmolyte transport, cell volume regulation, and energy production in the gills of two tilapia strains exposed to either freshwater or hypersaline water. Overall, genes showed similar expression patterns between strains. However, a wild population survey across a range of natural habitats and salinities did not reveal the expected patterns. Although significant, the correlations between gene expression and salinity were slightly ambiguous and did not show any link with phenotypic differences in life history traits previously reported between the same populations. The differential expression was also not associated with the population genetic structure inferred from neutral markers. The results suggest that the differential expression observed is not the result of evolutionary forces such as genetic drift or adaptation by natural selection. Instead, it can be speculated that genes responded to various abiotic and biotic stressors, including factors intrinsic to animals. This study provides clear evidence of the complexity of gene expression analysis in wild populations and shows that more attention needs to be paid when selecting candidates as potential biomarkers for monitoring adaptive responses to a specific environmental perturbation.
