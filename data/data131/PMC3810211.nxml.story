Oncolytic herpes simplex virus-1 (oHSV)–based vectors selectively replicate in tumor cells causing direct killing, ie., oncolysis, while sparing normal cells. oHSV’sare promising anticancer agents, but their efficacy, when used as single agents, leaves room for improvement. We hypothesized that combining the direct oncolytic and antiangiogenic activities of the IL-12 secreting NV1042 oHSV with microtubule disrupting agents (MDA’s) would be an effective means to enhance antitumor efficacy. Vinblastine (VB) was identified among several MDA’s screened that displayed consistent and potent cytotoxic killing of both prostate cancer and endothelial cell lines. In matrigel tube forming assays, VB was found to be highly effective at inhibiting tube formation of HUVEC cells. The combination of VB with NV1023 (the parental virus lacking IL-12) or NV1042 showed additive or synergistic activity against prostate cancer cell lines and was not due to increased oHSV replication by VB. In athymic mice bearing CWR22 prostate tumors, VB in combination with NV1042 was superior to the combination of VB plus NV1023 in reducing tumor burden, appeared to be nontoxic and resulted in a statistically significant diminution in the number of CD31
