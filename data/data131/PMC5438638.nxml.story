Recent microRNA (miRNA) expression profiling studies suggest the clinical use of miRNAs as potential prognostic biomarkers in various malignancies. In this study, aiming to identify microRNAs with prognostic value for overall survival (OS) in stomach adenocarcinoma (STAD) patients, we analyzed the miRNA expression profiles and the associated clinical characteristics in 380 STAD samples from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) dataset. An eight-miRNA signature for predicting OS in STAD patients was identified and self-validated by survival analysis and semi-supervised principal components method. We developed a linear prognostic model composed of these miRNAs to divide patients into high- and low-risk groups according to the calculated prognostic scores. Kaplan-Meier analysis demonstrated that patients in the high-risk group had worse OS compared with patients in the low-risk group. Notably, this miRNA prognostic model showed prognostic significance to the STAD patients in early stages and the chemo-resistant patients, who would potentially benefit from additional medical interventions. Finally, this eight-miRNA signature is an independent prognostic biomarker and demonstrates a good predictive performance for 5-year survival. Thus, this signature may serve as a novel biomarker for predicting survival as well as chemotherapy response in STAD patients.
