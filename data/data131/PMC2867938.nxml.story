Mammalian genomes contain vast intergenic regions that are extensively transcribed and generate various types of short and long non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs). Although in some cases specific functions have been assigned to intergenic transcripts, the functional significance of this transcriptional output remains largely unknown, and the possibility exists that part of this transcription reflects noise generated by random collisions of the transcriptional machinery with the genome to generate meaningless transcription. In this study we used chromatin signatures to characterize extragenic transcription sites targeted by RNA Polymerase II (RNA Pol II) in a highly regulated responseâ€”endotoxin activation of macrophages. We found that a significant portion of extragenic transcription sites are associated with the chromatin signature characteristic of enhancers. Consistent with their chromatin signature, we found that these extragenic transcription sites are under purifying selection and contain binding sites for inflammatory transcription factors, as well as for PU.1, a hematopoietic transcription factor that marks enhancers in macrophages. Moreover, much of this extragenic transcription is regulated by stimulation. We also identified hundreds of transcribed regions with a signature of canonical RNA genes. Our data indicate that extragenic transcription sites can be efficiently classified using chromatin signatures, which will be relevant for functional annotation of mammalian genomes.
