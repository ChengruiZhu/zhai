Correct expression of the genetic information is essential for life, and several quality control systems have evolved to ensure accurate protein synthesis. One of these processes, termed nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD), detects inappropriate termination of mRNA translation at premature termination codons (PTCs) and triggers degradation of the aberrant mRNA. Although the occurrence of NMD is well documented in yeast, worms, flies, mammals, and plants, the mechanism by which a termination event is defined as premature is still unclear, and different models have been proposed for different species. For mammals, the current prevailing view is that a termination codon is identified as premature and elicits NMD when it is located upstream of the 3′-most exon junction complex. However, well-documented examples of NMD triggered by PTCs in the last exon challenge this “mammalian NMD model.” Here we show that the physical distance between the termination codon and the poly(A)-binding protein PABPC1 is a crucial determinant for PTC recognition in human cells, indicating an evolutionarily conserved function of PABPC1 in promoting correct translation termination and antagonizing activation of NMD. Most importantly, our results demonstrate that spatial rearrangements of the 3′ untranslated region can modulate the NMD pathway and thereby provide a novel, translation-dependent mechanism for posttranscriptional gene regulation.
