-thyroxine until they reached to euthyroid levels. Plasma protein levels were compared by two-dimensional difference in gel electrophoresis (2D-DIGE) pre- and post-treatment. Twenty differentially expressed protein spots were detected. Thirteen were identified, and were found to be unique protein sequences by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry. Ten proteins were more abundant in the hypothyroid vs. euthyroid state: complement C2, serotransferrin, complement C3, Ig κ chain C region, α-1-antichymotrypsin, complement C4-A, haptoglobin, fibrinogen α chain, apolipoprotein A-I, and Ig α-1 chain C region. Three proteins were decreased in abundance in the hypothyroid vs. euthyroid state: complement factor H, paraneoplastic antigen-like protein 6A, and α-2-macroglobulin. The differentially abundant proteins were investigated by Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) to reveal their associations with known biological functions. Their connectivity map included interleukin-6 (IL-6) and tumour necrosis factor α (TNF-α) as central nodes and the pathway identified with the highest score was involved in neurological disease, psychological disorders, and cellular movement. The comparison of the plasma proteome between the hypothyroid vs euthyroid states revealed differences in the abundance of proteins involved in regulating the acute phase response.
