Cancer is still one of the leading causes of death in the Western world, and metastasis—the spread of cancer to distant sites—represents the most critical attribute for therapy failure. In colorectal cancer, up to one-third of patients have already developed metastasis at the time of diagnosis, and about half of newly diagnosed patients will develop metastasis during the course of the disease. MACC1 was first described as a key driver of metastasis formation in colorectal cancer, and its importance was later confirmed for other solid tumor entities. Stratification of patients with high MACC1 expression identifies patients at high risk of developing metastasis. Here we present a mechanism of targeting MACC1 as a potential therapy option for these high-risk patients. We identify the small molecules lovastatin and rottlerin as transcriptional inhibitors of MACC1. We describe the mechanism by which these molecules inhibit MACC1 expression and show that MACC1 inhibition leads to a reduced migratory phenotype in vitro and limits metastatic spread in preclinical mouse models. We propose repositioning of these 2 known drug molecules to reduce MACC1-driven metastasis formation in high-risk patients even before metastatic spread is clinically evident.
