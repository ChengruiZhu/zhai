The effects of 0.3–10 nM extracellular protons (pH 9.5–8.0) on ouabain-sensitive rubidium influx were determined in 4,4′-diisocyanostilbene-2, 2′-disulfonate (DIDS)-treated human and rat erythrocytes. This treatment clamps the intracellular H. We found that rubidium binds much better to the protonated pump than the unprotonated pump; 13-fold better in rat and 34-fold better in human erythrocytes. This clearly shows that protons are not competing with rubidium in this proton concentration range. Bretylium and tetrapropylammonium also bind much better to the protonated pump than the unprotonated pump in human erythrocytes and in this sense they are potassium-like ions. In contrast, guanidinium and sodium bind about equally well to protonated and unprotonated pump in human red cells. In rat red cells, protons actually make sodium bind less well (about sevenfold). Thus, protons have substantially different effects on the binding of rubidium and sodium. The effect of protons on ouabain binding in rat red cells was intermediate between the effects of protons on rubidium binding and on sodium binding. Remarkably, all four cationic inhibitors (bretylium, guanidinium, sodium, and tetrapropylammonium) had similar apparent inhibitory constants for the unprotonated pump (∼5–10 mM). The
