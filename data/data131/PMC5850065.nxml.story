Patellofemoral pain syndrome (PFPS) is one of the most common causes of knee pain and is present in females disproportionately more relative to males. PFPS causes tend to be multifactorial in nature and are described in this review. From a review of the current literature, it is clear that there needs to be further research on PFPS in order to better understand the complex etiology of this disorder in both males and females. It is known that females with patellofemoral pain syndrome demonstrate a decrease in abduction, external rotation and extension strength of the affected side compared with healthy patients. Conservative management, including optimizing muscle balance between the vastus medialis and lateralis around the patella along with formal therapy should be the first line of treatment in patients presenting with PFPS. Surgery should be reserved for patients in which all conservative management options have failed. This review aims to guide physicians in accurate clinicaldecision making regarding conservative and surgical treatment options when specifically faced with PFPS in a female athlete. Furthermore, we will discuss the anatomic variants, incidence and prevalence, etiology, diagnosis and treatment of PFPS.
