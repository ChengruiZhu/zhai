The aim of the present study was to evaluate the value of diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) and water imaging combined with dynamic contrast-enhanced scanning for the preoperative diagnosis and staging of rectal cancer. In total, 72 patients with pathologically confirmed rectal cancer were selected for examination using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with phased-array coils, DWI, water imaging and dynamic contrast-enhanced scanning. The patients were divided into two groups, experimental (simple enhanced scanning plus diffusion combined with water imaging) and control (simple enhanced scanning), for the pathological observations. The sensitivity, specificity and accuracy for the T staging of the carcinomas using scan enhancement with DWI and the evaluation of cancer using water imaging were 98.5% (65/66), 66.7% (4/6) and 95.8% (69/72), respectively, and the accuracy for N staging was 89%. Whereas, the sensitivity, specificity and accuracy for the T staging of the carcinomas using simple scan enhancement were 85.7% (42/49), 78.3% (18/23) and 83.3% (60/72), respectively, and the accuracy for N staging was 61%. Therefore, the combination of multiple MRI techniques may be of high value for the early diagnosis and exact staging of rectal cancer.
