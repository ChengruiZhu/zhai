In mammalian cells, DNA methylation is required for the maintenance of genome stability. Recent studies have shown that the genome-wide levels of DNA methylation can be reduced in DICER1-deficient mouse embryonic stem (ES) cells, suggesting that the activity of DNA methylating enzymes (DNMTs) may be regulated by small RNA molecules. The enzyme DICER1 catalyses the production of these small RNAs that serve as sequence-specific guides for modifying chromatin or transcription. However, these observations of defective DNA methylation have been inconsistent. We surmised that this inconsistency could be due to cell line “age,” because it can take many cell divisions before reduced DNMT activity may result in loss of DNA methylation. To test this idea, we rigorously assayed the functional level of DNMT activity in DICER1-deficient ES cells. First, we tested their ability to maintain DNA methylation over prolonged culture. Second, we tested their ability to rebound in DNA methylation after first stripping it from the genome. In both cases functional DNMT activity was entirely normal. We suggest that losses of DNA methylation sometimes seen in DICER1-deficient ES cells is stochastic and could involve cell line adaptation.
