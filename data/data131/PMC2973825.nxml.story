When a chromosome is fragmented by multiple double-strand breaks (DSBs), each set of DSB ends needs to be matched correctly during repair to avoid chromosomal rearrangements. Considering the case of two tandem DSBs, if the ends of different breaks (incorrect ends) are used for repair, loss of the intervening DNA can occur. Alternatively, when the ends of a single DSB (correct ends) are used for repair, the original order of the chromosome is restored. Deficiencies in the factors ATM and Nbs1, as seen in patients with Ataxia Telangiectasia and Nijmegen Breakage Syndrome, respectively, have been associated with elevated chromosome rearrangements and cancer predisposition. Hence, we examined the possibility that these factors may be important for the usage of correct ends during repair of multiple DSBs. For this, we developed a reporter system to examine end usage during repair of two tandem DSBs in mammalian chromosomes and found that disruption of ATM or Nbs1 leads to elevated usage of incorrect ends. Furthermore, we found that the role of ATM during end usage depends on a repair pathway called classical non-homologous end joining (c-NHEJ). We suggest that ATM suppresses genome rearrangements via limiting incorrect end utilization during c-NHEJ.
