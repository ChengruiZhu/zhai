Renal biopsy is an integral part of the nephrologists’ diagnostic armamentarium. Usually it is performed by radiologists or nephrologists with radiologist’s assistance. Our aim was to assess the efficacy and safety of percutaneous ultrasound-guided renal biopsy performed solely by nephrologists. We performed real-time ultrasound-guided renal biopsy on 37 patients (N group). The results were then compared with those of a similar number of biopsies done with radiologist’s support (NR group) immediately prior to these. In the N group, 36 biopsies (97.3%) were successful and were histopathologically adequate, whereas in the NR group, all biopsies were successful but only 28 were adequate (75.68%). Eighteen patients required only a single attempt in the N group, whereas majority (34 patients) in the NR group required two or more attempts. The average attempt per bit of renal tissue was 1.22 in both the groups. The average number of passes per patient was 1.77 in the N group and 2.32 in the NR group. The mean size of renal tissue obtained was 1.41 ± 0.47 cm in the N group and 1.19 ± 0.42 cm in the NR group. The average number of glomeruli was 15.62 ± 5.26 and 13.7 ± 7.38 in the N and NR groups, respectively (
