 have been studied by light and electron microscopy. Cells were incubated in monolayers with target erythrocytes sensitized with bacterial lipopolysaccharide. Three types of interaction between a proportion of the lymph cells and the erythrocytes surrounding them have been shown to indicate antibody formation: plaque-formation, immuno-cyto-adherence, and localized agglutination. At the peak of the response, 4 days after antigenic stimulation approximately 1 cell in every 200 from lymph node suspensions produces detectable specific antibody, while up to 1 cell in 20 in the lymph is active. For light microscope examination, individual antibody-forming cells were smeared in serum and stained with Leishman's stain. For electron microscopy, a number of active cells were clumped with antiserum to form a specimen of convenient size, then sectioned. Most of the active cells from efferent lymph are large and basophilic, while a small proportion are blastlike. These cells contain abundant free ribosomes and very little endoplasmic reticulum. In the node only, an additional class of antibody-forming plasma cells is found which have considerable amounts of endoplasmic reticulum in their cytoplasm.
