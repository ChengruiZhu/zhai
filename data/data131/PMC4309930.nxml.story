The purpose of this study was to determine dental graduates’ perceptions of learning environment in a prosthodontic department in a dental institute in India. The 60-item closed-ended, cross-sectional questionnaire with five options was completed by the dental graduates and the dentists. The data obtained was analyzed using statistical software. The mean, SD, frequency and percentages were calculated wherever appropriate. The questionnaire was answered by 242 dentists and dental graduates. Of the seven Dental College Learning Environment Survey scales, the highest mean scores were for student to student interaction (2.76 ± 0.53) followed by meaningful learning experience (2.67 ± 0.39). The lowest scores were for flexibility (2.26 ± 0.51) followed by supportiveness (2.40 ± 0.59). The lowest mean scores obtained for the ‘flexibility scale’ conveys that the opportunity for the faculty and students to modify the learning environment are less than for the other categories, and there is thus a need to modify the learning environment. Faculty should also increase their support to the students by contributing to an effective and meaningful interaction by creating a congenial environment.
