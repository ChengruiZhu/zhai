Tumor suppressors and oncogenes play critical roles in cancer development. The tumor suppressor p53 and the oncogene c-MYC are among the most frequently deregulated genes in human cancer, and their ubiquitylation mediated by several E3 ligases is critical for their turnover and their functions. P53 has been shown to be ubiquitylated by Pirh2; however, the physiological significance of this modification of p53 remains unknown. In this study we have generated mice deficient for Pirh2 and have observed that loss of Pirh2 results in a higher level of p53 and cell death, especially in response to radiation. Remarkably, we also identified that Pirh2 interacts with c-Myc and mediates its polyubiquitylation and degradation. c-Myc accumulates in the absence of Pirh2 and this accumulation is accompanied by increased tumorigenesis of Pirh2-deficient mice. We also report that dual deficiency of Pirh2 and p53 synergizes cancer development. Examination of the expression level of PIRH2 in human cancers indicated that its lower expression level associates with poor survival of patients with lung, ovarian, or breast cancers. Collectively, these data indentify Pirh2 as a novel tumor suppressor involved in the regulation of both p53 and c-Myc.
