Mink's immunoglobulin (Ig) G Fc gene was cloned, the gene was analyzed by phylogenetic analysis, and western blot was done to prove that the detection of distemper and canine parvovirus in dogs and minks can be universal. In order to get the certain length of Fc segment gene, a pair of primers is designed, which according to the Fc segment gene sequences of mink's IgG (L07789) published by GenBank, extracted total RNA from the spleen of minks and amplified it by RT-PCR. The results showed that the Fc segment gene contained 606 bp. Then it was sequenced after the amplified fragments were cloned into the vector PEasy-T1. Then the genetic evolution was analyzed. An antibody hybridization test was done through western blot. The results showed that nucleotide sequence homologies between minks and canines were 85%, and amino acid sequence homologies between minks and canines were 80.5%. Mink IgG heavy chain can effectively combine to anti-dog IgG by western blot. It was concluded that mink's and dog's IgG Fc had the closest relationship in mammalian through the analysis of the genetic evolution. Based on the above analysis and related literature, we concluded that we could detect mink diseases with a dog diagnosis reagent, or treat mink diseases with dog antiserum.
