The objective of the present work was to establish a large panel of preclinical models of human renal cell carcinoma (RCC) directly from patients, faithfully reproducing the biological features of the original tumor. RCC tissues (all stages/subtypes) were collected for 8 years from 336 patients undergoing surgery, xenografted subcutaneously in nude mice, and serially passaged into new mice up to 13 passages. Tissue samples from the primary tumor and tumors grown in mice through passages were analyzed for biological tissue stability by histopathology, mRNA profiling, von Hippel-Lindau gene sequencing, STR fingerprinting, growth characteristics and response to current therapies. Metastatic models were also established by orthotopic implantation and analyzed by imagery. We established a large panel of 30 RCC models (passage > 3, 8.9% success rate). High tumor take rate was associated with high stage and grade. Histopathologic, molecular and genetic characteristics were preserved between original tumors and case-matched xenografts. The models reproduced the sensitivity to targeted therapies observed in the clinic. Overall, these models constitute an invaluable tool for the clinical design of efficient therapies, the identification of predictive biomarkers and translational research.
