The functional role of the dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus (dLGN), placed on route from retina to primary visual cortex in the early visual pathway, is still poorly understood. A striking feature of the dLGN circuit is that dLGN cells not only receive feedforward input from the retina, but also a prominent feedback from cells in the visual cortex. It has been seen in experiments that cortical feedback modifies the spatial properties of dLGN cells in response to visual stimuli. In particular, it has been shown to increase the center-surround antagonism for flashing-spot and patch-grating visual stimuli, i.e., the suppression of responses to very large stimuli compared to smaller stimuli. Here we investigate the putative mechanisms behind this feature by means of a comprehensive network model of biophysically detailed neuron models for RCs and INs in the dLGN and orientation-selective cortical cells providing the feedback. Our results support that the experimentally observed feedback effects may be due to a phase-reversed (‘push-pull’) arrangement of the cortical feedback where ON-symmetry RCs receive (indirect) inhibitory feedback from ON-dominated cortical cell and excitation from OFF-dominated cortical cells, and vice versa for OFF-symmetry RCs.
