The concept of the ventricular gradient (VG) was conceived in the 1930s and its calculation yielded information that was not otherwise obtainable. The VG was not utilized by clinicians at large because it was not easy to understand and its computation time-consuming. Spatial vectorcardiography is based on the concept of the VG. Its current major clinical use is to identify primary [heterogeneity of ventricular action potential (VAP) morphology] in the presence of secondary [heterogeneity in ventricular depolarization instants] T-wave abnormalities in an ECG. Nowadays, the calculation of the spatial VG can be computed on the basis of a regular routine ECG and contributes to localization of arrhythmogenic areas in the heart by assessing overall and local VAP duration heterogeneity. Recent population-based studies suggest that the spatial VG is a dominant ECG predictor of future cardiovascular events and death and it is superior to more conventional ECG parameters. Its assessment warrants consideration for intensified primary and secondary prevention efforts and can be included in everyday clinical practice. This review addresses the nature and diagnostic potential of the spatial VG. The main focus is the role of the spatial VG in ECG assessment of dispersion of repolarization, a key factor in arrhythmogeneity.
