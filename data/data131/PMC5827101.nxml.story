Dynamic controllability of self‐organized helical superstructures in spatial dimensions is a key step to promote bottom‐up artificial nanoarchitectures and functional devices for diverse applications in a variety of areas. Here, a light‐driven chiral overcrowded alkene molecular motor with rod‐like substituent is designed and synthesized, and its thermal isomerization reaction exhibits an increasing structural entropy effect on chemical kinetic analysis in anisotropic achiral liquid crystal host than that in isotropic organic liquid. Interestingly, the stimuli‐directed angular orientation motion of helical axes in the self‐organized helical superstructures doped with the chiral motors enables the dynamic reconfiguration between the planar (thermostationary) and focal conic (photostationary) states. The reversible micromorphology deformation processes are compatible with the free energy fluctuation of self‐organized helical superstructures and the chemical kinetics of chiral motors under different conditions. Furthermore, stimuli‐directed reversible nonmechanical beam steering is achieved in dynamic hidden periodic photopatterns with reconfigurable attributes prerecorded with a corresponding photomask and photoinduced polymerization.
