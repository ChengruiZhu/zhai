A total of 60 patients (30 Latarjet, 30 DTA) with an average age of 26.5±7.8 years were analyzed at an average 46±17 months (range, 24-87) following surgery. Twenty-two patients (73%) in each group underwent prior ipsilateral shoulder surgery (range, 1 to 3 surgeries) prior to Latarjet or DTA. There were no statistical differences in age, BMI, or number of prior surgeries between the groups. There were no differences between the groups in regards to recurrent instability events, subluxation, or apprehension on final examination (P>0.8). Patients in both groups experienced significant improvements in all outcomes scores following surgery (P>0.05 for all). When comparing final outcomes of Latarjet versus DTA, no significant differences were found in postoperative ASES, WOSI or SANE scores between the groups (P>0.05 for all). In the Latarjet group, 1 patient underwent reoperation (3.3%) with arthroscopic debridement with subacromial decompression for persistent anterolateral shoulder pain. In the DTA group, 1 patient (3.3%) underwent reoperation with DTA revision for asymptomatic hardware failure. There were no cases of neurovascular injuries or other complications in either cohort.
