. In order to investigate the relationship between particle size and diffusion ability, two kinds of liposome loaded with Vincristine (VCR-Lip) were prepared. The diffusion behavior of VCR-Lip with different particle size and free VCR was compared through diffusion stability study. The diffusion ability from 12-well culture plate to Millipore transwell of each formulation reflected on HepG-2 cytotoxicity results. Different cell placement methods and drug adding positions were used to study the VCR-Lip diffusion behaviors, which influenced the apoptosis of HepG-2 cell. The different cell uptake of Nile redâ€“Lip and free Nile red was compared when changed the adding way of fluorescent fluorescein. To study the penetration ability in HepG-2 tumor spheroids, we constructed 30 nm and 100 nm Cy5.5-Lip to compare with free Cy5.5. Then the anti-tumor effect, tissue distribution of free VCR injection, 30 nm and 100 nm VCR-Lip were further investigated on the HepG-2 tumor bearing nude mice. The results of these study showed that the diffusion ability of free drug and fluorescent fluorescein was remarkable stronger than which encapsulated in liposomes. Moreover, diffusion ability of smaller liposome was stronger than larger one. In this way, 30 nm liposome had not only faster and stronger tumor distribution than 100 nm liposome, but also higher tumor drug accumulation than free drug as well. Our study provided a new thinking to improve the targeting efficiency of nano drug delivery system, no matter passive or active targeting.
