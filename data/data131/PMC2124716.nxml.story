 1. In non-nephrectomized animals the addition of adrenalin to sodium chloride solutions or to mixtures of sodium chloride and calcium chloride solutions increases the amount of urine and of ascites, and diminishes the intestinal fluid (this diminution takes place only with mixtures of solutions of sodium chloride and calcium chloride, the quantity of intestinal fluid remaining approximately unchanged in the sodium chloride series). 2. In nephrectomized animals the addition of adrenalin to sodium chloride solutions or to mixtures of sodium chloride and calcium chloride solutions again increases the ascites and diminishes the amount of intestinal fluid in both sodium chloride and sodium chloride plus calcium chloride series. 3. We find, therefore, a summation of the action of calcium chloride and adrenalin in regard to their influence upon the formation of ascites, an antagonistic action in regard to the elimination of urine; here the influence of calcium chloride in diminishing the urine is more potent than is the action of adrenalin in increasing the amount of urine. The adrenalin decreases the elimination of fluid into the intestines and in this case we note a summation of the actions of calcium chloride and of adrenalin. 4. We see, therefore, that adrenalin and calcium chloride influence the amount of ascitic fluid and of intestinal fluid in the same direction. The amount of urine is, however, decreased by calcium chloride and increased by adrenalin. 5. If we increase the rapidity of inflow of the solutions and simultaneously decrease proportionately the time of the infusion, the amount of ascites and intestinal fluids in nephrectomized animals remains approximately unchanged, as compared with the amounts obtained at the usual rate of inflow.
