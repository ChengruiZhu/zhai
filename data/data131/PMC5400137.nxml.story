35 patients less than 25 years of age underwent biceps tenodesis and were available for follow up at two years (77%). 33 of 35 patients were athletes with 15 patients playing at the collegiate level with softball and baseball representing the most common sports. 22 patients were overhead athletes. 16 patients had no prior shoulder surgery with 19 representing revision shoulder procedures. Overall, mean VAS improved from 5.0 ± 1.2 to 2.0 ± 1.1 (p<0.0001). All clinical outcome scores improved with ASES score improving from 54.7 to 81.7 (mean difference 27.0±3.7, 95% CI 19.5,34.6), (p<0.0001), ASES functional score improved from 17.5 to 25.1 (7.5±1.2, 95% CI 5.0,10.0) (p<0.001), and SST improved from 7.4 to 10.1 (2.7±0.5, 95% CI 1.7,3.7) (p<0.0001). Range of motion was maintained postoperatively. Patients with higher BMI trended toward less improvement in function (p=0.0854) and SST (p=0.0355). At the time of follow-up, four patients (11%) had undergone revision surgery. 22 of 33 (66%) patients returned to sports with 16 returning at the same level and 6 at a lower level of play. 16 of 21 (76%) overhead athletes return to sport with 4 requiring additional surgery after biceps tenodesis. There was no difference in scores for overhead versus nonoverhead athletes.
