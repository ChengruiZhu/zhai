The researchers used weekly data on HFMD incidence collected in 31 Chinese provinces between 2009 and 2013 to develop a two-serotype time series susceptible–infected–recovered epidemic model (a model in which individuals are born, become susceptible to a disease, become infected and infectious with the disease, and recover). The model accurately simulated the epidemic cycles of EV-A71- and CV-A16-associated HFMD for the 31 provinces and the seasonal transmission patterns in both northern and southern Chinese provinces. It provided an estimate of cross-protection following infection with EV-A71 or CV-A16 of ten weeks in 68% of the population (an average duration of cross-protection of 6.77 weeks). The estimated basic reproduction number (the average number of additional cases one case of an infectious disease generates in an otherwise uninfected population) across China for both serotypes was 25, which means that vaccination coverage levels of above 96% are required to achieve population-level immunity. Finally, the model predicted a decrease in EV-A71-associated HFMD incidence with higher rates of EV-A71 vaccination and suggested that CV-A16 incidence following EV-A71 vaccination would be comparable to or only slightly higher than its incidence before vaccination.
