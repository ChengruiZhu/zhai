The role of intracellular free magnesium concentration ([Mg2+]) in modulating calcium release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) was studied in voltage-clamped frog cut skeletal muscle fibers equilibrated with cut end solutions containing two calcium indicators, fura-2 and antipyrylazo III (AP III), and various concentrations of free Mg2+ (25 microM-1 mM) obtained by adding appropriate total amounts of ATP and magnesium to the solutions. Changes in AP III absorbance were used to monitor calcium transients, whereas fura-2 fluorescence was used to monitor resting calcium. The rate of release (Rrel) of calcium from the SR was calculated from the calcium transient and found to be increased in low internal [Mg2+]. After correcting for effects of calcium depletion from the SR and normalization to SR content, the mean values of the inactivatable and noninactivatable components of Rrel were increased by 163 and 46%, respectively, in low Mg2+. Independent of normalization to SR content, the ratio of inactivatable to noninactivatable components of Rrel was increased in low internal [Mg2+]. Both observations suggest that internal [Mg2+] preferentially modulates the inactivatable component of Rrel, which is thought to be due to calcium-induced calcium release from the SR. This could also explain the observation that, in low internal [Mg2+], the time to the peak of the calcium transient for a 5-ms depolarizing pulse was not very different from the time to the peak of the delta [Ca2+] for a 10- ms pulse of the same amplitude. Finally, in low internal [Mg2+], the calcium transient elicited by a short depolarizing pulse was in some cases clearly followed by a very slow rise of calcium after the end of the pulse. The observed effects of reduced [Mg2+] on calcium release are consistent with a removal of the inhibition that the normal 1 mM myoplasmic [Mg2+] exerts on calcium release in skeletal muscle fibers.
