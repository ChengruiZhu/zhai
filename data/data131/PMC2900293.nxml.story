We propose a statistical thermodynamics model for determining structurally and functionally important residues in ligand-protein interactions. Our method identifies the path that the protein uses in transferring information from one point to the other. We show that a few energetically active residues are most efficient in energy exchange with the surroundings acting as ‘energy gates’. The remaining important residues that we identify are situated along the interaction path. These are the hub residues. Strong correlations exist between energy gates and hub residues along the interaction path, thus relating to allostery and cooperative binding. We studied the structure-function, ligand binding and allosteric activities of ten models of HLA Class I proteins of the immune system. Five of these models belong to the HLA-B*2705 allele and are strongly associated with a chronic inflammatory rheumatic disease. The remaining five from the HLA-B*2709 allele of the same protein are the corresponding properly functioning ones. We show that differences in the contact maps of the two types lead to significant and consistent changes in the fluctuation profile, making the HLA-B*2705 alleles respond too strongly to perturbation.
