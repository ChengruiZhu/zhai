Animals can defend themselves against parasites through either resistance (reducing parasite numbers, for example, by killing them) or tolerance (maintaining health as infections levels increase, for example, by repairing damage). Resistance has been well-studied in wild animals, but tolerance has been less so. We analysed data on body weight collected over 25 years on a natural population of Soay sheep, infected with parasitic gut worms. As parasite burden increased, sheep lost weight. Crucially, there was variation among individuals: some lost weight rapidly with increasing infections (i.e., showed “low tolerance”), whereas others lost weight slowly (i.e., showed “high tolerance”). The least tolerant individuals lost 4.5 kg of body weight across the range of parasite burdens that we saw, whereas the most tolerant lost only around 0.36 kg. However, variation in tolerance did not have a heritable genetic basis, so that although tolerance varied between individuals, this was not due to genetic differences. Further analysis revealed that there was natural selection on tolerance. Individuals who were more tolerant of infection produced more offspring over the course of their lives. This study shows that natural selection can act upon resistance and tolerance simultaneously in nature, a result that has implications for both human health and livestock management.
