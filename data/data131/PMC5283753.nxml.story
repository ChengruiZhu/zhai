Allosteric communication is essential for the function of proteins. Recent work shows that allostery results from dynamic processes in the protein associated with atomic fluctuations leading to entropic interactions that involve ensemble of pathways rather than discrete two state transitions. Based on this new picture of allostery, it was proposed that allostery may indeed be an intrinsic property of all proteins. In order to test this hypothesis, we derive the computational tools for quantifying allosteric communication, and explain allostery in terms of entropy transfer, a new concept based on information theory. We use molecular dynamics simulations from which we calculate the transfer of entropy between pairs of residues. Results show that certain residues act as entropy sources while others as entropy sinks. Evaluation of time delayed correlations shows the presence of causality of interactions that allow us to differentiate between residues that are drivers in allosteric activity and those that are driven. Identification of driver-driven relations is important for drug design. Using the example of Ubiquitin, we identify paths of information transfer that control its binding to diverse partners in the Ubiquitin-Proteasome System. The proposed model can determine and quantify allosteric activity in any given protein.
