The thymus is the specialized organ responsible for generating T cells, which are required to regulate and effect immune responses. The unique functions of the thymus are mediated by a diverse array of specialized epithelial cells found only within this organ. These specialized, functionally mature thymic epithelial cells are generated from immature epithelial progenitor cells present in the fetal and adult thymus through a highly regulated process, termed differentiation, that is tightly controlled by specific genes. Foxn1, a protein that is expressed in thymic epithelial cells, is a transcription factorâ€”a protein that regulates how other genes are expressed. Here, we have investigated the role of Foxn1 in generating mature thymic epithelial cells from immature progenitors. We find that Foxn1 is required throughout this process, from the onset of differentiation in progenitor thymic epithelial cells in the developing fetus to the final differentiation steps through which thymic epithelial cells mature to acquire their full functionality. We further find that Foxn1 controls the expression of a variety of genes with different functions in thymic epithelial cells. Overall, our study defines the role of Foxn1 in thymus development at the cellular level and provides insight into how it mediates these functions.
