The evolutionary conserved TOR complex 1 controls growth in response to the quality and quantity of nutrients such as carbon and amino acids. The protein kinase Sch9 is the main TORC1 effector in yeast. However, only few of its direct targets are known. In this study, we performed a genome-wide screening looking for mutants which require Sch9 function for their survival and growth. In this way, we identified multiple components of the highly conserved vacuolar proton pump (V-ATPase) which mediates the luminal acidification of multiple biosynthetic and endocytic organelles. Besides a genetic interaction, we found Sch9 also physically interacts with the V-ATPase to regulate its assembly state in response to glucose availability and TORC1 activity. Moreover, the interaction with the V-ATPase has consequences for ageing as it allowed Sch9 to control vacuolar pH and thereby trigger either lifespan extension or lifespan shortening. Hence, our results provide insights into the signaling mechanism coupling glucose availability, TORC1 signaling, pH homeostasis and longevity. As both Sch9 and the V-ATPase are highly conserved and implicated in various pathologies, these results offer fertile ground for further research in higher eukaryotes.
