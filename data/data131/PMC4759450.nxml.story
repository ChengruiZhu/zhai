Malaria parasites are carried from host to host by blood-feeding insects, a process that requires some portion of the parasite population to develop into transmission forms that cannot replicate within the current host. The fraction of parasites specialized for transmission instead of replication (transmission investment) could change with each cycle of replication in response to changing conditions within the host. Measuring how transmission investment changes through time could help us understand how malaria spreads so efficiently through populations of human and other animals. However, transmission investment is usually impossible to measure directly and instead has to be estimated by comparing the number of transmission forms with total parasite numbers in blood samples. Here we use a model to simulate data from an infection—so that the true level of transmission investment is known—and test published methods for estimation. We find that existing methods do not accurately estimate transmission investment from simulated data, and we propose a new statistical method that works substantially better. When applied to rodent malaria data, our method suggests that transmission investment can vary substantially over the course of infection, with notably different patterns of allocation across hosts.
