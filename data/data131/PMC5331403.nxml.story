Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) includes a range of disorders characterized by excess accumulation of triglycerides within the liver. While simple steatosis may be clinically stable, non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) can be progressive. Inflammation is believed to be the driving force behind NASH and the progression to fibrosis and subsequent cirrhosis. NAFLD is globally considered a significant health concern not only because of its incidence but also because of its economic impact. The fact that NAFLD is associated with cardiovascular disease is widely recognized, as well as the fact that NAFLD patient mortality rises when such an association is present. In particular, NAFLD is associated with coronary and carotid atherosclerosis, endothelial dysfunction and arterial rigidity, ventricles function, valves morphology, congestive heart failure, and arrhythmias (especially atrial fibrillation). Additionally, the hypercoagulability status in NAFLD patient may be suggested by the presence of inflammatory and coagulation markers. In order to differentiate between milder forms and the more severe ones that necessitate aggressive therapy, individualized risk scores may be used. This narrative review will analyze and interpret the papers published in PubMed in the last 16 years, in an attempt to expand our understanding of the NASH as a possible cardiovascular risk factor.
