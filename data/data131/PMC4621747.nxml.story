 channel, which is expressed at high levels in central neurons and is an important regulator of neuronal excitability. We found that expression of the V378A variant results in voltage-activated currents that are sensitive to the selective Kv2 channel blocker guangxitoxin-1E. These voltage-activated Kv2.1 V378A currents were nonselective among monovalent cations. Striking cell backgroundâ€“dependent differences in expression and subcellular localization of the V378A mutation were observed in heterologous cells. Further, coexpression of V378A subunits and wild-type Kv2.1 subunits reciprocally affects their respective trafficking characteristics. A recent study reported epileptic encephalopathy-linked missense variants that render Kv2.1 a tonically activated, nonselective cation channel that is not voltage activated. Our findings strengthen the correlation between mutations that result in loss of Kv2.1 ion selectivity and development of epileptic encephalopathy. However, the strong voltage sensitivity of currents from the V378A mutant indicates that the loss of voltage-sensitive gating seen in all other reported disease mutants is not required for an epileptic encephalopathy phenotype. In addition to electrophysiological differences, we suggest that defects in expression and subcellular localization of Kv2.1 V378A channels could contribute to the pathophysiology of this KCNB1 variant.
