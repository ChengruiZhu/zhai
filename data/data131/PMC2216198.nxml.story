Single Na channel currents were compared in ventricular myocytes and cortical neurons of neonatal rats using the gigaseal patch-clamp method to determine whether tissue-specific differences in gating can be detected at the single-channel level. Single-channel currents were recorded in cell-attached and excised membrane patches at test potentials of -70 to -20 mV and at 9-11 degrees C. In both cell- attached and excised patches brain Na channel mean open time progressively increased from less than 1 ms at -70 mV to approximately 2 ms at -20 mV. Near threshold, single openings with dispersed latencies were observed. By contrast, in cell-attached patches, heart Na channel mean open time peaked near -50 mV, was three times brain Na channel mean open time, and declined continuously to approximately 2 ms at -20 mV. Near threshold, openings occurred frequently usually as brief bursts lasting several milliseconds and rarely as prolonged bursts lasting tens of milliseconds. Unlike what occurs in brain tissue where excision did not change gating, in excised heart patches both the frequency of prolonged bursting and the mean open time of single units increased markedly. Brain and cardiac Na channels can therefore be distinguished on the basis of their mean open times and bursting characteristics.
