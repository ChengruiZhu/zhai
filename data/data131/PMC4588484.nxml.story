A total of 133 subjects were included. (Figure 1) The average age at injury was 15 years old (range, 7.83 to 18.56) The median time to surgery among all subjects was 2.29 months [interquartile range 1.31 to 4.30]. A total of 26 subjects (19.55%) underwent ACL surgery greater than five months post injury. A total of 59 chondral and 119 meniscal injuries were identified. The prevalence of chondral and/or meniscal injuries requiring operative treatment was 57.14% [95% CI: 48.73 to 65.55%]. A delay in surgery of greater than 5 months [p = 0.0001] and a return to activity prior to surgery [p = 0.0007] were significantly related to increased severity of concomitant pathology. The odds of a subject presenting with a chondral and/or meniscal injury that required additional operative treatment were 7.81 [95% CI: 2.21 to 27.58] times greater for a subject that underwent surgery greater than five months after their initial injury. Demographic factors that were not significantly related include: gender [p = 0.1601], laterality [p =0.3940], BMI percentage [p =0.2969], ethnicity [p = 0.5233], bracing prior to surgery [p = 0.6848] and the subjective report of knee instability prior to surgery [p = 0.3940]. Age at injury [p= 0.0004], household income based on median income associated with zip code [p=0.0150] and type of insurance (private vs. none/government assisted) [p = 0.0491] were significantly related to the timing of ACL surgery. After controlling for household income, the rate at which surgery occurred was 1.19 times [95% CI: 1.09 to 1.30] greater for every one year increase in age at the time of injury. After controlling for age at injury, the rate at which surgery occurred was 1.13 times [95% CI: 1.04 to 1.21] greater for every $10,000 increase in household income.
