Nearly half a century ago, the Canadian psychologist D. O. Hebb postulated the formation of assemblies of tightly connected cells in cortical recurrent networks because of changes in synaptic weight (Hebb's learning rule) by repetitive sensory stimulation of the network. Consequently, the activation of such an assembly for processing sensory or behavioral information is likely to be expressed by precisely coordinated spiking activities of the participating neurons. However, the available analysis techniques for multiple parallel neural spike data do not allow us to reveal the detailed structure of transiently active assemblies as indicated by their dynamical pairwise and higher-order spike correlations. Here, we construct a state-space model of dynamic spike interactions, and present a recursive Bayesian method that makes it possible to trace multiple neurons exhibiting such precisely coordinated spiking activities in a time-varying manner. We also formulate a hypothesis test of the underlying dynamic spike correlation, which enables us to detect the assemblies activated in association with behavioral events. Therefore, the proposed method can serve as a useful tool to test Hebb's cell assembly hypothesis.
