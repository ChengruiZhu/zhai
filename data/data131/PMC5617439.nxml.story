IFN-τ is specifically secreted by the conceptus in ruminants during early pregnancy, and it plays a vital role in the immunological function of pregnancy. However, its mechanism involving microRNA (miRNA) is still not well understood. Deep sequencing was used to explore the specific miRNA library of IFN-τ on bovine endometrial epithelial cells (bEECs). The results showed that 574 known bovine miRNAs and 109 novel miRNAs were identified. We found 74 differentially expressed miRNAs, including 30 commonly expressed miRNAs in the experiment. Then, qPCR verification of six selected miRNAs showed that they corresponded with the sequencing data. Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway analysis revealed significant enrichment of predicted target genes of differentially expressed miRNAs, including influenza A, herpes simplex infection, antigen processing and presentation, viral myocarditis, TNF signaling pathway, graft-versus-host disease, and allograft rejection. These results may provide important contributions to the immune response during early pregnancy in ruminants, but further studies are need to verify the proposed cellular/immunological effects and role of specific miRNA as biomarkers
