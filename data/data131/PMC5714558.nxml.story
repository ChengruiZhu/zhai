Phase‐based respiratory‐gated radiotherapy relies on the reproducibility of patient breathing during the treatment. To monitor the positional reproducibility of patient breathing against a 4D CT simulation, we developed a real‐time motion verification system (RMVS) using an optical tracking technology. The system in the treatment room was integrated with a real‐time position management system. To test the system, an anthropomorphic phantom that was mounted on a motion platform moved on a programmed breathing pattern and then underwent a 4D CT simulation with RPM. The phase‐resolved anterior surface lines were extracted from the 4D CT data to constitute 4D reference lines. In the treatment room, three infrared reflective markers were attached on the superior, middle, and inferior parts of the phantom along with the body midline and then RMVS could track those markers using an optical camera system. The real‐time phase information extracted from RPM was delivered to RMVS via in‐house network software. Thus, the real‐time anterior‐posterior positions of the markers were simultaneously compared with the 4D reference lines. The technical feasibility of RMVS was evaluated by repeating the above procedure under several scenarios such as ideal case (with identical motion parameters between simulation and treatment), cycle change, baseline shift, displacement change, and breathing type changes (abdominal or chest breathing). The system capability for operating under irregular breathing was also investigated using real patient data. The evaluation results showed that RMVS has a competence to detect phase‐matching errors between patient's motion during the treatment and 4D CT simulation. Thus, we concluded that RMVS could be used as an online quality assurance tool for phase‐based gating treatments.
