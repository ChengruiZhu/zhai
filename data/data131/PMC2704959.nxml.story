Small molecule kinase inhibitors (SMKIs) are a class of chemicals that have successfully been used for the treatment of a number of oncological diseases that are now being pursued by the pharmaceutical industry for inflammatory diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis. SMKIs are generally designed to specifically inhibit one kinase, but this is challenging due to the structural similarity of the ATP binding pocket amongst different members of the kinase family. The inability to selectively inhibit just one kinase can be problematic, as kinases play key roles in a number of cellular processes. Thus the unwanted inhibition of additional kinases can lead to undesirable toxicities that may halt drug development. One type of toxicity often observed with this class of compounds is damage to chromosomes, which can occur when kinases involved with cell cycle progression or chromosome dynamics are inhibited. Here we demonstrate that mathematical modeling can be used to identify kinases that correlate with chromosome damage, information which can assist medicinal chemists in avoiding certain kinases when synthesizing new chemicals. Generation of this type of information is one of the first steps in beginning to reduce toxicity-based attrition for this class of compounds.
