The laboratory data at the onset including hemoglobin, serum concentration of homocysteine, blood urea nitrogen (BUN), creatinine, electrolytes, and thyroid hormones were normal. The electroencephalogram (EEG), lower-extremity somatosensory evoked potential (SEP), and nerve conduction velocity (NCV) in four limbs were normal. The average period of follow-up was 34.60 ± 12.76 months. The MRI examination showed acute or subacute pontine infarction lesions, 3 cases in the rostral inner side, 1 case in the rostral lateral and inner side, and 1 case in rostral lateral side. The neurological deficits included weakness in 4 cases, contralateral sensory deficit in 1 case, and ataxia in 2 cases. All 5 patients presented with symptom of RLS at or soon after the onset of infarction and 4 patients experienced uncomfortable sensations in the paralyzed limbs contralateral to the ischemic lesion. Their neurological deficits improved significantly 2 weeks later, but the symptoms of RLS did not resolve. Among them, 3/5 patients were treated with dopaminergic drugs. At the end of the follow-up, RLS symptom eventually resolved in 3 patients but persisted in two. The IRLS-RS, NIHSS and mRS scores were significantly lower at the onset than those at the last follow-up (
