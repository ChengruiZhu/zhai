Surgical site infections (SSIs) after spinal surgery are a serious complication that can be minimized with prophylaxis. Vancomycin is a common agent used in the prevention of SSI. Given that vancomycin is renally cleared, its use requires careful observation in dialysis-dependent patients due to toxicity at supratherapeutic levels. Since minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) for vancomycin have increased due to the emergence of resistant pathogens, the use of vancomycin in such patients is further complicated. Local instillation of vancomycin powder is thought to provide additional protection against SSI and have lower systemic absorption. We present a patient with end-stage renal disease that developed progressively debilitating cervical spondylotic myelopathy necessitating multilevel laminectomy and instrumented fusion. Prior to closure, 1 gram of vancomycin powder was sprinkled into the surgical incision. Postoperative serum vancomycin levels were well below those associated with nephrotoxicity and ototoxicity. Based on this experience, we reviewed the relevant guidelines that were designed to prevent postoperative infections in such dialysis-dependent patients. Intrawound application of vancomycin may be a legitimate and safe option for SSI prophylaxis in patients with renal failure on dialysis.
