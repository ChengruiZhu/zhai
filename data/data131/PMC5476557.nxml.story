 sp. LU1 biomass and succinic acid production were investigated employing response surface methodology (RSM) with central composite design. Statistical methods led to the development of an efficient and inexpensive microbiological media based on crude glycerol, whey permeate as carbon sources and urea as a nitrogen source. The optimized production of bacterial biomass in aerobic conditions was predicted and the interactive effects between crude glycerol, urea and magnesium sulfate were investigated. As a result, a model for predicting the concentration of bacterial biocatalyst biomass was developed with crude glycerol as a sole carbon source. In addition, it was observed that the interactive effect between crude glycerol and urea was statistically significant. Response surface methodology was also employed to develop the model for predicting the concentration of succinic acid produced. Validity of the model was confirmed during verification experiments wherein actual results differed from predicted values by 0.77%. The applied statistical methods proved the feasibility for anaerobic succinic acid production on crude glycerol without expensive yeast extract addition. In conclusion, the RSM method can provide valuable information for succinic acid scale-up fermentation using
