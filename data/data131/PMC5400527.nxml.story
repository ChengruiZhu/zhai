. We find that stable shRNA depletion of each of nine individual signature genes strongly inhibits breast cancer growth and aggressiveness. Several factors within this nine-gene set regulate each others expression, suggesting that together they form a network. The nine-gene set is regulated by estrogen, ERBB2 and EGF signaling, all established breast cancer factors. We also uncover three transcription factors, MYC, E2F1 and TP53, which act alongside Fra-1 at the core of this network. ChIP-Seq analysis reveals that a substantial number of genes are bound, and regulated, by all four transcription factors. The nine-gene set retains significant prognostic power and includes several potential therapeutic targets, including the bifunctional enzyme PAICS, which catalyzes purine biosynthesis. Depletion of PAICS largely cancelled breast cancer expansion, exemplifying a prognostic gene with breast cancer activity. Our data uncover a core genetic and prognostic network driving human breast cancer. We propose that pharmacological inhibition of components within this network, such as PAICS, may be used in conjunction with the Fra-1 prognostic classifier towards personalized management of poor prognosis breast cancer.
