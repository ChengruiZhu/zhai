In metabolism, molecules with “high-energy” bonds (e.g., ATP and Acetyl~CoA) are critical for both catabolic and anabolic processes. Accordingly, the retention of these bonds during biochemical transformations is incredibly important. The phosphotransacylase (Pta) enzyme catalyzes the conversion between acyl-CoA and acyl-phosphate. This reaction directly links an acyl-CoA with ATP generation via substrate-level phosphorylation, producing short-chain fatty acids (e.g., acetate), and also provides a path for short-chain fatty acids to enter central metabolism. Due to this key function, Pta is conserved across the bacterial kingdom. Recently, a new type of phosphotransacylase was described that shares no evolutionary relation to Pta. This enzyme, PduL, is exclusively associated with organelles called bacterial microcompartments, which are used to catabolize various compounds. Not only does PduL facilitate substrate level phosphorylation, but it also is critical for cofactor recycling within, and product efflux from, the organelle. We solved the structure of this convergent phosphotransacylase and show that it is completely structurally different from Pta, including its active site architecture. We also discuss features of the protein important to its packaging in the organelle.
