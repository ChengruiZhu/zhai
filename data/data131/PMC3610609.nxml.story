Maintenance of the germline depends on the presence of a germline stem cell pool with self-renewal potential that produces gametes upon meiotic differentiation. Factors regulating the balance between germline stem cell self-renewal and meiotic differentiation ensure germline homeostasis, whereas disruption of these regulatory mechanisms can lead to sterility or cancer. In this study, we show that the ubiquitin-proteolytic system (UPS), which selectively targets regulatory proteins for proteasomal degradation, controls germline development by acting at three different levels. The UPS promotes germ cell proliferation, regulates the balance between self-renewal and meiotic differentiation, and limits progression through meiotic prophase. In particular, we show that an E3 ubiquitin-Ligase nucleated around the cullin 2 (CUL-2) protein and using the Leucine rich repeat protein LRR-1 as substrate recognition subunit regulates in germ stem cells the stability of HTP-3, which is required for progression through meiotic prophase. These findings identify a previously unknown role for proteolytic regulation in germline development and also explain how the critical balance between germ cell proliferation and meiotic differentiation can be tightly and robustly controlled with multiple, parallel regulatory inputs.
