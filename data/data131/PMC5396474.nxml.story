MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a class of evolutionarily conserved small noncoding RNAs, ~22â€‰nt in length, and found in diverse organisms and play important roles in the regulation of mRNA translation and degradation. It was shown that miRNAs were involved in many key biological processes through regulating the expression of targets. Genetic polymorphisms in miRNA target sites may alter miRNA regulation and therefore result in the alterations of the drug targets. Recent studies have demonstrated that SNPs in miRNA target sites can affect drug efficiency. However, there are still a large number of specific genetic variants related to drug efficiency that are yet to be discovered. We integrated large scale of genetic variations, drug targets, gene interaction networks, biological pathways, and seeds region of miRNA to identify miRNA polymorphisms affecting drug response. In addition, harnessing the abundant high quality biological network/pathways, we evaluated the cascade distribution of tarSNP impacts. We showed that the predictions can uncover most of the known experimentally supported cases as well as provide informative candidates complementary to existing methods/tools. Although there are several existing databases predicting the gain or loss of targeting function of miRNA mediated by SNPs, such as PolymiRTS, miRNASNP, MicroSNiPer, and MirSNP, none of them evaluated the influences of tarSNPs on drug response alterations. We developed a user-friendly online database of this approach named Mir2Drug.
