The cerebral cortex contains a network of electrically active cells (neurons) interconnected by synapses, which may be excitatory (tending to increase activity) or inhibitory. Network activity, i.e., the ensemble of activity patterns of the individual cells, is driven by input from the sense organs, and creates an internal representation of features of the outside world. In auditory cortex, sound frequency (pitch) is encoded by the physical location of activity in the network. Thus, connections among cells at various distances may blur or sharpen the frequency representation. Recent work in living animals has yielded conflicting results: sharpening of responses via lateral inhibition in some cases, versus balanced excitation and inhibition (co-tuning) in others. It was previously unknown whether a single cortical network architecture could account for this spectrum of findings. Here, computer simulations based on experimental data reveal that this is indeed the case. Varying input to the network causes smooth transitions between lateral inhibition and co-tuning, accompanied by changes in the strength and timing of the responses. Diverse input-dependent response patterns in a single network may be a general mechanism enabling the brain to process a wide range of sensory information under various conditions.
