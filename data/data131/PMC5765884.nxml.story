Research seeking to uncover the mechanisms by which we read aloud has focused almost exclusively on monosyllabic items presented in isolation. Consequently, important challenges that arise when considering polysyllabic word reading, such as stress assignment, have been ignored, while little is known about how important sentence-level stress cues, such as syntax and rhythm, may influence word reading aloud processes. The present study seeks to fill these gaps in the literature by (a) documenting the individual influences of major sublexical cues that readers use to assign stress in single-word reading in English and (b) determining how these cues may interact with contextual stress factors in sentence reading. In Experiments 1, 2, and 3 we investigated the effects of prefixation, orthographic weight (i.e., number of letters in a syllable), and vowel length on stress assignment by asking participants to read aloud carefully-constructed nonwords that varied on the presence of these cues. Results revealed individual effects of all three cues on the assignment of second-syllable stress. In Experiment 4, we tested the effects of these cues on stress assignment in the context of sentence reading. Results showed that sublexical cues influenced stress assignment over and above higher-level syntactic and rhythmic cues. We consider these findings in the framework of extant rule-based, distributed-connectionist, and Bayesian approaches to stress assignment in reading aloud, and we discuss their applications to understanding reading development and acquired and developmental reading disorders.
