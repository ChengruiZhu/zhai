The Osteoporosis Self-assessment Tool for Asians (OSTA) is a validated index based on age and weight to predict the risk of osteoporosis in women. This cross-sectional study was designed to evaluate the impact of sexual dimorphism on the trauma patterns and the clinical outcomes of patients with high-risk OSTA scores. Trauma data of patients with high-risk OSTA scores between 1 January 2009 and 31 December 2015 were retrieved from the trauma registry system of a level I trauma center. A total of 2248 patients including 1585 women and 663 men were included in this study. In-hospital mortality was assessed as the primary outcome in the propensity score-matched analyses of the female and male patients, which were created in a 1:1 ratio under the adjustment of potential confounders, including age, co-morbidity, mechanism and injury-severity score (ISS). Female patients with a high-risk OSTA score had significantly lower mortality rates than their male counterparts. Among the propensity score-matched population, female patients had lower odds of having cerebral contusion and pneumothorax, but higher odds of presenting with radial, ulnar and femoral fractures than male patients. In addition, the female patients still had significantly lower odds of mortality (odds ratio (OR), 0.5; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.29â€“0.90;
