-protein. These findings could be explained by a regulatory involvement of the G-protein-dependent integrin-associated protein CD47. In support of this notion, we observed a collagen I-induced association between CD47 and α2 integrins. This association was reduced by a blocking anti-CD47 antibody but not by PTX or a control anti-β2 antibody. Furthermore, a blocking antibody against CD47, dominant negative CD47 or specific siRNA knock down of CD47, significantly reduced collagen I-induced COX-2 expression. COX-2 has previously been shown to regulate intestinal epithelial cell adhesion and migration. Morphological analysis of intestinal cells adhering to collagen I revealed a co-localisation of CD47 and α2 integrins to non-apoptotic membrane blebs enriched in Rho A and F-actin. The blocking CD47 antibody, PTX and a selective COX-2 inhibitor, dramatically inhibited the formation of these blebs. In accordance, migration of these cells on a collagen I-coated surface or through a collagen I gel were significantly reduced by the CD47 blocking antibody, siRNA knock down of CD47 and the COX-2 inhibitor NS-398. In conclusion, we present novel data that identifies the G-protein-dependent CD47 protein as a key regulator of collagen I-induced COX-2 expression and a promoter of intestinal epithelial cell migration.
