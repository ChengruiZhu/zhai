No meta-analysis has been performed to evaluate the association between LINC00152 and the survival of patients with cancers. We thus carried out this study. The online databases, such as PubMed, EMBASE, and the Cochrane controlled trials register, were searched to identify relevant articles. Dichotomous data were analyzed using the odds ratio (OR) as the summary statistic. The association between LINC00152 and survival of cancer was analyzed by pooling the hazard ratio (HR) with its corresponding 95% confidence interval (CI). Nine studies with 862 patients with cancer were included in this meta-analysis. The expression of LINC00152 was not associated with the age of patients (OR = 0.79, 95% CI = 0.55–1.14) and gender (OR = 1.08, 95% CI = 0.74–1.58). However, we found significant positive associations between LINC00152 and lymph node metastasis (OR = 2.54, 95% CI = 1.54–4.18) and TNM stage (OR = 2.32, 95% CI = 1.36–3.93). Furthermore, the expression of LINC00152 was significantly associated with tumor recurrence (OR = 3.32, 95% CI = 1.98–5.57) and shorter OS (HR = 1.94, 95% CI = 1.25–3.02). In conclusion, the results of this meta-analysis suggest that LINC00152 might be a biomarker for shorter OS and tumor recurrence in cancers.
