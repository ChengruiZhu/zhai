Because of the deep involvement of granulosa cells in the processes surrounding the cycles of menstruation and reproduction, there is a great need for a deeper understanding of the ways in which they function during the various stages of those cycles. One of the main ways in which the granulosa cells influence the numerous sex associated processes is hormonal interaction. Expression of steroid sex hormones influences a range of both primary and secondary sexual characteristics, as well as regulate the processes of oogenesis, folliculogenesis, ovulation, and pregnancy. Understanding of the exact molecular mechanisms underlying those processes could not only provide us with deep insight into the regulation of the reproductive cycle, but also create new clinical advantages in detection and treatment of various diseases associated with sex hormone abnormalities. We have used the microarray approach validated by RT-qPCR, to analyze the patterns of gene expression in primary cultures of human granulosa cells at days 1, 7, 15, and 30 of said cultures. We have especially focused on genes belonging to ontology groups associated with steroid biosynthesis and metabolism, namely “Regulation of steroid biosynthesis process” and “Regulation of steroid metabolic process”. Eleven genes have been chosen, as they exhibited major change under a culture condition. Out of those, ten genes, namely
