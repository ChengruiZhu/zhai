The mean age was 73 years (range,70-82 years) in 49 shoulders (33 men,11 women,5 bilateral) with a mean acromion-humeral distance of 9.2 mm (range,3.0 -15.9 mm). Four shoulders (8%) were revision procedures of a prior rotator cuff repair. Twenty-eight shoulders (57%) had full thickness tears of two tendons and one shoulder (2%) had full thickness tears of three tendons. Twelve shoulders (25%) had osteoarthritis with Outerbridge criteria of 3 or 4. All patients had a Goutallier classification of 2 or below. No patients required revision rotator cuff surgeries; however, 1 patient had surgical treatment for stiffness. Mean follow-up was 3.6 years (range, 2.0 - 6.9 years) in 43/49 (88%) shoulders. All postoperative outcomes measures demonstrated significance when compared to their preoperative baselines. The ASES scores improved by 34.3 points from 56.0 preoperatively to 90.3 postoperatively (p<0.001) with significant improvements in both pain and function components. The SANE score improved from 63.1 to 85.1 (p=0.034), QuickDASH from 34.1 to 11.3 (p< 0.001), and SF-12 PCS from 43.0 to 51.6 (p<0.001). There was significant improvement in the impact of pain affecting ADLs (p< 0.001), recreational sporting activities (p< 0.001), and sleeping (p< 0.001). Median satisfaction was 10/10 (range,1-10). Patients who modified their recreational activities due to postoperative weakness were significantly less satisfied (6 vs 10; p=.018). In this study, 24/31 (77%) were able to return to their sport at a similar level of intensity to preinjury levels.
