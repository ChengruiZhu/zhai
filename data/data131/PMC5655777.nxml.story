Patients who harbor brain arteriovenous malformations are at risk for intracranial hemorrhage. These malformations are often seen in inherited vascular diseases such as hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia. However, malformations within the brain also sporadically occur without a hereditary‐coding component. Here, we review recent insights into the pathophysiology of arteriovenous malformations, in particular, certain signaling pathways that might underlie endothelial cell pathology. To better interpret the origins, determinants and consequences of brain arteriovenous malformations, we present a clinical case to illustrate the phenotypic landscape of the disease. We also propose that brain arteriovenous malformations might share certain signaling dimensions with those of anorectal hemorrhoids. This working hypothesis provides casual anchors from which to understand vascular diseases characterized by arteriovenous lesions with a hemorrhagic‐ or bleeding‐risk component.
