Although quantitative physiology has developed numerous mathematical descriptions of components of the human body, their application in clinical medicine has been limited to a few mostly primitive and physiologically inaccurate models. One reason for this is that the inverse problem of identifying unknown model parameters and states from prior knowledge and clinical observations does not usually have a unique solution. Hypothesizing that this non-uniqueness might actually convey clinically useful information, we used a simplified mathematical model of the cardiovascular system and its control, in combination with Bayesian inference techniques, to simulate the diagnosis of low blood pressure in an acute care setting. The inference procedure yielded a distribution of physiologically interpretable model parameters and states that exhibited multiple peaks. The key observation was that these peaks corresponded directly to clinically relevant differential diagnoses, enabling a quantitative, probabilistic assessment of the simulated patient's condition. We conclude that the proposed probabilistic approach to the inverse problem in quantitative physiology may not only be useful for quantitative interpretation of clinical data, and eventually allow model-based prediction and therapy optimization, but also provides a novel link between mathematically described physiological mechanisms and the clinical concept of differential diagnoses based on patient-specific information.
