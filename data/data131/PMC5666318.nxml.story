The information on candidate cancer driver alterations available from public databases is often descriptive and of limited mechanistic insight, which poses difficulties for reliable distinction between true driver and passenger events. To address this challenge, we performed in-depth analysis of whole-exome sequencing data from cell lines generated by a barrier bypass-clonal expansion (BBCE) protocol. The employed strategy is based on carcinogen-driven immortalization of primary mouse embryonic fibroblasts and recapitulates early steps of cell transformation. Among the mutated genes were almost 200 COSMIC Cancer Gene Census genes, many of which were recurrently affected in the set of 25 immortalized cell lines. The alterations affected pathways regulating DNA damage response and repair, transcription and chromatin structure, cell cycle and cell death, as well as developmental pathways. The functional impact of the mutations was strongly supported by the manifestation of several known cancer hotspot mutations among the identified alterations. We identified a new set of genes encoding subunits of the BAF chromatin remodeling complex that exhibited Ras-mediated dependence on PRC2 histone methyltransferase activity, a finding that is similar to what has been observed for other BAF subunits in cancer cells. Among the affected BAF complex subunits, we determined
