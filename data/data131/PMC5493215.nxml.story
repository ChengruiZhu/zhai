 T-lymphocyte count at lymphoma diagnosis was 188 cells/μL (range, 10 to 535 cells/μL). Patients with BL/DLBCL were significantly older and had less bone marrow involvement and lower baseline serum lactase dehydrogenase than patients with BL. Eighty-nine percent of patients presented with advanced disease, and 25% had baseline CNS involvement. Chemotherapy regimens consisted of cytoreduction with low-dose cyclophosphamide, vincristine, and prednisone followed by induction with vincristine, methotrexate, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin and prednisone (LMB 86; 57%); hyperfractionated cyclophosphamide, vincristine, doxorubicin, dexamethasone, methotrexate, and cytarabine (hyper-CVAD; 20%); cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone and high-dose methotrexate with leucovorin rescue on day 10 with accompanying prophylactic IT chemotherapy (Stanford regimen; 14%); and cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone (CHOP-like; 9%) regimens. Twenty-three patients received CNS treatment or prophylaxis, and 31 received concurrent combination antiretroviral therapy. Two-year overall survival was 38% (95% CI, 22% to 54%) and 2-year event-free survival was 23% (95% CI, 11% to 38%), with no difference between histologic subtypes. Common causes of death were infection (41%) and CNS disease progression or systemic relapse (41%).
