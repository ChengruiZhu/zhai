Traditionally, the regulation of gene expression was thought to be largely based on DNA and RNA sequence motifs. However, this dogma has recently been challenged as other factors, such as epigenetic patterning of the genome, have become better understood. Sparse but convincing experimental evidence suggests that the epigenetic background, in the form of histone modifications, acts as an additional layer of regulation determining how transcripts are processed. Here we developed a computational approach to investigate the genome-wide prevalence and the level of association between the enrichment of epigenetic marks and transcript diversity generated via alternative transcription start sites and splicing. We found that the role of epigenetic patterning in alternative transcription start-site switching is likely to be the same for all genes whereas the role of epigenetic patterns in splicing is likely gene-specific. Furthermore, we show that epigenetic data alone can be used to predict the inclusion pattern of an exon. These findings have significant implications for a better understanding of the regulation of transcript diversity in humans as well as the modifications arising during tumor development.
