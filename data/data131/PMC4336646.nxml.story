To investigate the anti-viral responses of human mast cells, we performed PCR array analysis of these cells after infection with vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV). PCR array analysis revealed that human mast cells up-regulated several anti-viral genes, including melanoma differentiation-associated gene 5, retinoic acid-inducible gene-I, and Toll-like receptor 3, together with type I interferons and chemokines, upon VSV infection. Additionally, we found that 2′-5′ oligoadenylate synthetase, which also works as a virus recognition receptor by activating the latent form of RNase L, leading to viral RNA degradation, was up-regulated in human mast cells upon VSV infection. Moreover, small interfering RNA analysis to identify the receptors responsible for mast cell activation by VSV revealed that these receptors reciprocally cooperate to produce anti-viral cytokines and chemokines, inhibiting VSV replication. Our findings suggest that human mast cells produce cytokines and chemokines using several viral recognition receptors, leading to the inhibition of viral replication. These data provide novel information that improves our understanding of the roles of human mast cells in immune responses against viruses.
