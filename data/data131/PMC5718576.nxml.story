Since the clinical implementation of novel rotational forms of intensity‐modulated radiotherapy, a variety of planning studies have been published that reinforce the major selling points of the technique. Namely, comparable or even improved dose distributions with a reduction in both monitor units and treatment times, when compared with static gantry intensity‐modulated radiotherapy. Although the data are promising, a rigorous approach to produce these plans has yet to be established. As a result, this study outlines a robust and streamlined planning strategy with a concentration on RapidArc class solutions for prostate with a simultaneous integrated boost. This planning strategy outlines the field setup, recommended starting objectives, required user interactions to be made throughout optimization and post‐optimization adjustments. A comparative planning study, with static gantry IMRT, is then presented as justification for the planning strategy itself. A variety of parameters are evaluated relating to both the planning itself (optimization and calculation time) and the plans that result. Results of this comparative study are in line with previously published data, and the planning process is streamlined to a point where the RapidArc optimization time takes
