Nonsense mutations are single-nucleotide variations within the coding sequence of a gene that result in a premature termination codon. The presence of such mutations leads to the synthesis of a truncated protein unable to fulfill its normal function. Over the last ten years, treatment strategies have emerged based on the use of molecules, such as aminoglycoside antibiotics (gentamicin) that facilitate the readthrough of premature termination codons, thus restoring the synthesis of a full-length protein. Such strategies have been tested for various genetic diseases, including Duchenne muscular dystrophy and cystic fibrosis. The readthrough level depends on the nature of the stop codon and the surrounding nucleotide context, but little was known of the rules governing readthrough level and response to aminoglycosides. In this study, we use a large set of nonsense mutations for an in-depth statistical analysis designed to decipher the element of the nucleotide context responsible for modulating readthrough levels. We analyse the impact of the six nucleotides upstream and downstream from the stop codon. We demonstrate that the presence of a uracil residue immediately upstream the stop codon is associated with a stronger response to gentamicin treatment than the presence of any of the other three nucleotides.
