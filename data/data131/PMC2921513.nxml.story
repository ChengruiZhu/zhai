Transhepatic cardiac catheterization and intervention is used in selected cases in our institution. A retrospective review of transcatheter interventions for the pulmonary artery was conducted. Forty-five transhepatic procedures were performed. Thirteen involved intervention, to rehabilitate the branch pulmonary arteries. The median weight of the patients was 9.9 Kg ± 3.4. The patients' age ranged from eight months to 86 months (median 23 months). The largest sheath used was 7F. All the patients underwent success intervention with no complication related either to the transhepatic approach or the intervention. The branch pulmonary artery diameter increased from 4.5 ± 2.2 mm to 7 ± 3 mm. Most of the procedures were performed under conscious sedation / deep sedation protocol. Hemostasis was achieved in all patients by gradual sheath withdrawal, followed by application of upward pressure on the tract from the subcostal area. In the absence of patent femoral veins the transhepatic approach can be used to perform successful and safe interventions, to rehabilitate the pulmonary artery system. It may offer the additional advantage of using larger sheaths than would be felt appropriate for the femoral veins.
