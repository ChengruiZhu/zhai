Ischemia reperfusion (IR) and cyclosporine A (CsA) injuries are unavoidable in kidney transplantation and are associated with allograft dysfunction. Herein, the effect and mechanism of a novel tissue protective peptide, helix B surface peptide (HBSP) derived from erythropoietin, were investigated in a rat model. The right kidney was subjected to 45 min ischemia, followed by left nephrectomy and 2-week reperfusion, with or without daily treatment of CsA 25 mg/kg and/or HBSP 8 nmol/kg. Blood urea nitrogen was increased by CsA but decreased by HBSP at 1 week and 2 weeks, while the same changes were revealed in urinary protein/creatinine only at 2 weeks. HBSP also significantly ameliorated tubulointerstitial damage and interstitial fibrosis, which were gradually increased by IR and CsA. In addition, apoptotic cells, infiltrated inflammatory cells, and active caspase-3+ cells were greatly reduced by HBSP in the both IR and IR + CsA groups. The 17 kD active caspase-3 protein was decreased by HBSP in the IR and IR + CsA kidneys, with decreased mRNA only in the IR + CsA kidneys. Taken together, it has been demonstrated, for the first time, that HBSP effectively improved renal function and tissue damage caused by IR and/or CsA, which might be through reducing caspase-3 activation and synthesis, apoptosis, and inflammation.
