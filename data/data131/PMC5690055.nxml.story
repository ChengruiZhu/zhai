A low‐resource visually monitored deep inspiration breath‐hold (VM‐DIBH) technique was successfully implemented in our clinic to reduce cardiac dose in left‐sided breast radiotherapy. In this study, we retrospectively characterized the chest wall and heart positioning accuracy of VM‐DIBH using cine portal images from 42 patients. Central chest wall position from field edge and in‐field maximum heart distance (MHD) were manually measured on cine images and compared to the planned positions based on the digitally reconstructed radiographs (DRRs). An in‐house program was designed to measure left anterior descending artery (LAD) and chest wall separation on the planning DIBH CT scan with respect to breath‐hold level (BHL) during simulation to determine a minimum BHL for VM‐DIBH eligibility. Systematic and random setup uncertainties of 3.0 mm and 2.6 mm, respectively, were found for VM‐DIBH treatment from the chest wall measurements. Intrabeam breath‐hold stability was found to be good, with over 96% of delivered fields within 3 mm. Average treatment MHD was significantly larger for those patients where some of the heart was planned in the field compared to patients whose heart was completely shielded in the plan (
