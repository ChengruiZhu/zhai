Proteins are the cellular workhorses, performing essentially all of the functions required for cell and organismal survival. But, it takes a great deal of energy to make proteins, making it critical that proteins are made accurately and in the proper time frame. After a ribosome synthesizes a protein, release factors catalyze the accurate and timely release of the finished protein from the ribosome, a process called termination. Ribosomes are then recycled and start the next protein. We utilized ribosome profiling, a method that allows us to follow the position of every ribosome that is making a protein, to globally investigate and strengthen insights on termination fidelity for cells with and without mutant release factors. We find that as we decrease release factor function, the time to terminate/release a protein increases across the genome. We observe that the accuracy of terminating a protein at the correct place decreases on a global scale. Using this metric we identify genes with inherently low termination efficiency and confirm two novel events resulting in extended protein products. In addition we find that beyond disrupting accurate protein synthesis, release factor mutations can alter expression of genes involved in the production of key amino acids.
