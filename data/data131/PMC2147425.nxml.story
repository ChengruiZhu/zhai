. 900 msec. During the first 100 msec., the facilitation is large enough to cause a spike. In the later portion only the prepotential is facilitated. No electrical concomitant has been detected. 8. Neural volleys reaching the plaque from different trunks interact at the cell to produce a period of facilitation lasting only about 2 msec. This interaction is interpreted as spatial summation. 9. In a population of cells, simultaneous stimulation of 2 nerves causes a smaller discharge than the sum of the two isolated responses (occlusion). 10. Cells denervated for 7 weeks or more can be excited directly, but only by a current flow outward through the caudal face. 11. Weak direct stimulation causes a prepotential in the denervated plaque. On increasing the stimulus the prepotential increases to a critical size when a spike develops. The duration of both responses is about 2 msec. 12. The absolutely refractory period of the denervated cell is about 1.5 msec. and relative refractoriness lasts about 15 msec. 13. Direct stimulation causes slight facilitation lasting as long as 200 msec. 14. Repetitive stimulation of the nerve at low frequencies (2 to 3 per second) causes rapid "fatigue" of transmission. The denervated plaque, however, responds for several minutes to repetitive direct stimulation at high frequencies (25 per second).
