During meiosis, DNA is deliberately damaged by formation of double-strand breaks. Programmed breaks must be repaired for cell division to be completed. Break repair enables reciprocal exchange between parental chromosomes, and this exchange acts as a link between chromosomes before anaphase separation. These links are essential to ensure that maternal and paternal chromosomes segregate into different daughter cells. Meiosis has special mechanisms to ensure the repair creates sufficient reciprocal exchanges between parental chromosomes; Dmc1 protein is essential for these mechanisms to work. When Dmc1 is absent, programmed breaks accumulate with excess single-stranded DNA nearby. Using reporter constructs integrated into yeast, we examined repair of an experimentally induced break expected not to need Dmc1. When Dmc1 is absent, programmed breaks accumulate in single-stranded form, and the experimental break is not repaired. Either preventing formation of programmed breaks, or stopping DNA near them from becoming single-stranded, relieves this repair block. We conclude that repair proteins are likely to be in limited supply during meiosis, and they run out in cells lacking Dmc1 function. Limiting protein supply may be an important regulatory mechanism, protecting DNA from potentially damaging effects of oversupply.
