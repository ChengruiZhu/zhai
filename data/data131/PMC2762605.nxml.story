Using the three dimensional motion capture technology, kinematics of walking and clearing obstacles, head and body orientation were analyzed before and up to 60 days after the lesion. Recordings were performed in treadmill running rats with or without obstacles attached to the treadmill belt. The lesion, which was induced by the direct injection of the mitochondrial toxin malonate into the left caudoputamen resulted in the complete destruction of the dorsal striatum. During the first three days following the lesion, rats were unable to run on the treadmill. Thereafter, rats showed normal looking locomotion, yet the contralesional limbs exhibited changes in length and timing parameters, and were overflexed. Moreover, the head of lesioned rats was orientated towards the side of the lesion, and their postural vertical shifted towards the contralesional side. During obstructed running, the contralesional limbs when they were leading the crossing manoeuvre stepped on the obstacle rather than to overcome obstacle without touching it, yet more frequently with the forelimb than the hindlimb. Unsuccessful crossings appeared to be due to a paw placement farther away from the front of the obstacles, and not to an inappropriate limb elevation. Importantly, deficit in locomotor behaviour did not regress over the time.
