The spatiotemporal dispersal of organisms can inform efforts to conserve endangered species, to contain the spread of drug resistance, and to eliminate disease. As genomic data become increasingly more affordable and accessible via public depositories, the demand for methods capable of extracting fine-scale population structure from genomic data grows. However, to the best of our knowledge, there are no guidelines regarding the type of data and methods required to resolve local spatial trends over sexually recombining haploid organisms, such as the malaria parasite. The approach we present here compares relatedness based on identity by descent, which accounts for recombination while distinguishing genetic identity due to inheritance from genetic identity due to chance, to a classic population genetic measure of divergence, using data from sexually recombining malaria parasites. Using identity by descent, we uncover a significant decrease in highly related malaria parasites collected from proximal clinics on the Thai-Myanmar border, a region where human mobility is high. Our results demonstrate the power of analyses based on identity by descent to detect recent and local trends. Similar analyses could be used to inform the molecular epidemiology of other sexually recombining organisms.
