-glycolic acid) (PLGA) NPs as carriers for fluorofenidone (AKF) to improve the antifibrotic efficacy of this drug in the lung. Spd-AKF-PLGA NPs were prepared and functionalized by modified solvent evaporation with Spd and polyethylene glycol (PEG)-PLGA groups. The size of Spd-AKF-PLGA NPs was 172.5±4.3 nm. AKF release from NPs was shown to fit the Higuchi model. A549 cellular uptake of an Spd–coumarin (Cou)-6-PLGA NP group was found to be almost twice as high as that of the Cou-6-PLGA NP group. Free Spd and difluoromethylornithine (DFMO) were preincubated in A549 cells to prove uptake of Spd-Cou-6-PLGA NPs via a polyamine-transport system. As a result, the uptake of Spd-Cou-6-PLGA NPs significantly decreased with increased Spd concentrations in incubation. At higher Spd concentrations of 50 and 500 µM, uptake of Spd-Cou-6-PLGA NPs reduced 0.34- and 0.49-fold from that without Spd pretreatment. After pretreatment with DFMO for 36 hours, cellular uptake of Spd-Cou-6-PLGA NPs reached 1.26-fold compared to the untreated DFMO group. In a biodistribution study, the drug-targeting index of Spd-AKF-PLGA NPs in the lung was 3.62- and 4.66-fold that of AKF-PLGA NPs and AKF solution, respectively. This suggested that Spd-AKF-PLGA NPs accumulated effectively in the lung. Lung-histopathology changes and collagen deposition were observed by H&E staining and Masson staining in an efficacy study. In the Spd-AKF-PLGA NP group, damage was further improved compared to the AKF-PLGA NP group and AKF-solution group. The results indicated that Spd-AKF-PLGA NPs are able to be effective nanocarriers for anti–pulmonary fibrosis therapy.
