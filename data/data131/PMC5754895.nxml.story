The aim of the present study was to investigate risk-related microRNAs (miRs) for bladder urothelial carcinoma (BUC) prognosis. Clinical and microRNA expression data downloaded from the Cancer Genome Atlas were utilized for survival analysis. Risk factor estimation was performed using Cox's proportional regression analysis. A microRNA-regulated target gene network was constructed and presented using Cytoscape. In addition, the Database for Annotation, Visualization and Integrated Discovery was used for Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathway enrichment, followed by protein-protein interaction (PPI) network analysis. Finally, the K-clique method was applied to analyze sub-pathways. A total of 16 significant microRNAs, including hsa-miR-3622a and hsa-miR-29a, were identified (P<0.05). Following Cox's proportional regression analysis, hsa-miR-29a was screened as a prognostic marker of BUC risk (P=0.0449). A regulation network of hsa-miR-29a comprising 417 target genes was constructed. These target genes were primarily enriched in GO terms, including collagen fibril organization, extracellular matrix (ECM) organization and pathways, such as focal adhesion (P<0.05). A PPI network including 197 genes and 510 interactions, was constructed. The top 21 genes in the network module were enriched in GO terms, including collagen fibril organization and pathways, such as ECM receptor interaction (P<0.05). Finally, 4 sub-pathways of cysteine and methionine metabolism, including paths 00270_4, 00270_1, 00270_2 and 00270_5, were obtained (P<0.01) and identified to be enriched through DNA (cytosine-5)-methyltransferase (
