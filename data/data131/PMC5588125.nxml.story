Invasion of the trachea is observed in ~6% of patients with differentiated thyroid carcinoma (DTC), and surgery is accepted as the treatment of choice. However, surgical procedures can be challenging and are associated with various risks. The authors of the present study performed a retrospective study of patients with DTC and tumor invasion of the trachea. Outcomes from patients that received circumferential sleeve resection (CSR) of the trachea followed by anastomosis in the absence of suprahyoid release (n=21; CSR group) and patients that underwent tangential resections [n=103; tangential ‘shave’ resection (TSR) group) were analyzed. In the CSR group, 4 to 8 tracheal rings were circumferentially resected. All patients underwent end-to-end anastomosis in the absence of suprahyoid release following CSR, and 7 patients developed cancer metastasis following surgery. With the exception of 2 patients that succumbed to disease, the remaining patients in the CSR group survived without cancer recurrence. In the TSR group, all of the patients experienced cancer recurrence within five years post-surgery. A total of 61 patients developed metastases in the three years following surgery, and 71 patients succumbed to cancer metastasis within five years. The survival rate of the CSR group was significantly increased compared with the TSR group. The results of the present study suggest that in DTC patients with defects involving up to 8 tracheal rings, it may be appropriate to perform anastomosis without suprahyoid tissue release as it is associated with a reduced incidence of perioperative morbidity.
