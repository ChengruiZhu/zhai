All organs and differentiated tissues in multicellular organisms are derived from undifferentiated pluripotent stem cells. The evolutionarily conserved Polycomb-group (Pc-G) proteins control stem cell identity and maintenance, likely by repressing genes involved in differentiation processes. Pc-G proteins are epigenetic regulators, thus they maintain stable expression states of their target genes through cell divisions that are not accompanied by changes in their DNA sequence. In this study, we asked whether Pc-Gâ€“mediated gene regulation is also dynamically regulated in plant development to confer stable, but flexible gene expression states that may switch in response to developmental or environmental cues. We therefore generated genome-wide maps of Pc-G activity of undifferentiated stem cell and differentiated leaf cell tissues which revealed dynamic regulation of Pc-G activity in plants. Pc-G activity is correlated with gene repression and its tissue-specific release results in local gene activation. Pc-G proteins target specific gene families in the two analyzed tissues, indicating a role for Pc-G proteins in balancing pluripotency and differentiation in plants. Based on our analyses, we propose that Pc-G activity not only permits long-term gene regulation but also has a more basic gene regulatory function in fine-tuning expression patterns of specific gene families during differentiation.
