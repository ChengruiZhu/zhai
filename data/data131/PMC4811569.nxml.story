The researchers tested 218 whole blood specimens collected from patients with suspected or confirmed EVD using both the Trombley and the Xpert assay. After excluding a few samples that gave Xpert results that were reported as “invalid” or “error,” 22 out of 22 Trombley-positive samples were Xpert-positive, and 181 out of 189 Trombley-negative samples were Xpert-negative. That is, the Xpert assay had a sensitivity (true positive rate) of 100% and a specificity (true negative rate) of 95.8% compared to the benchmark assay. Notably, seven of the eight Trombley-negative but Xpert-positive blood samples were follow-up samples obtained from previously Trombley-positive patients, which suggests that the specificity of the Xpert test was actually 99.5%. When the Xpert assay was used to test 71 buccal swabs, the sensitivity and specificity of the Xpert assay were both 100%. Finally, Xpert results obtained using a pipette versus a swab to pick up a portion of blood for testing were concordant in 78 out of 79 samples; this test was done in part to get an indication of whether the Xpert Ebola assay will work on fingerstick samples—blood samples obtained by using a sterile lancet to pierce the fingertip and then collecting the blood with a swab; this collection method is more easily done in the field at point of care than venipuncture.
