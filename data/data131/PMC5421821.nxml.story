Electrophysiological recordings from cortical circuits reveal strongly irregular and highly complex temporal patterns of in-vivo neural activity. In the last decades, a large number of theoretical studies have speculated on the possible sources of fluctuations in neural assemblies, pointing out the possibility of self-sustained irregularity, intrinsically generated by network mechanisms. In particular, a seminal study showed that purely deterministic, but randomly connected rate networks intrinsically develop chaotic fluctuations due to the recurrent feedback. In the simple and highly symmetric class of models considered in classical works, the transition from stationary activity to chaos is characterized by the behavior of the auto-correlation function and the critical slowing down of fluctuations. Following up on recent works, here we combine analytical and numerical tools to investigate the macroscopic dynamics generated by more realistic models of excitatory and inhibitory rate units. We show that the presence of excitation leads to a strong signature of the onset of chaos in the first-order statistics of the network activity, and that this effect is highly robust with respect to spiking noise. We moreover find that excitation leads to two different types of fluctuating activity at moderate and strong synaptic coupling, even when inhibition dominates. Finally, we test the appearance of analogous dynamical regimes in networks of integrate-and-fire neurons.
