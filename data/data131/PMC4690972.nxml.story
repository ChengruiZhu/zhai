We have investigated the relationship between the polymorphisms and haplotypes in the CETP gene, and dyslipidemia among the Xinjiang Kazak and Uyghur populations in China. A total of 712 patients with dyslipidemia and 764 control subjects of CETP gene polymorphism at rs12149545, rs3764261, rs1800775, rs711752, rs708272, rs289714, rs5882, and rs1801706 loci were studied by the Snapshot method, linkage disequilibrium analysis and haplotype construction. The results are as follows: (1) the minor allele of eight loci of frequencies in the two groups were different from other results of similar studies in other countries; (2) In the linear regression analysis, the HDL-C levels of rs708272 TT, rs1800775 AA, rs289714 CC and rs711752 AA genotypes were significantly higher than those of other genotypes, however, the rs3764261 GG and rs12149545 GG genotypes were significantly lower than those of other genotypes in the two ethnic groups. The HDL-C levels of the rs12149545 GG genotype were lower than those of other genotypes; (3) in the control group, the rs708272 CT genotype of TG levels were lower than in the CC genotype, the T genotype of LDL-C levels were lower than in the CC genotype, and the HDL-C levels were higher than in the CT genotype; the rs1800775 AC genotype of TG levels were higher than in the AA genotype, the rs711752 AG genotype of TG levels were lower than in the GG genotype, the AA genotype LDL-C levels were lower than in the GG genotype, and the HDL-C levels were higher than in the AG genotype; the rs1800775 AC genotype of TG levels were higher than in the AA genotype. In the dyslipidemia group, the rs708272 TT genotype of TC and LDL-C levels were higher than in the CT genotype and the rs3764261 TT genotype of TC levels were higher than in the GG genotype. The rs711752 AA genotype of TC and LDL-C levels were higher than in the AG genotype, and the rs12149545 AA genotype of TC and LDL-C levels were higher than in the GG genotype; (4) perfect Linkage Disequilibrium was observed for two sets of two SNPs: rs3764261 and rs12149545; rs711752 and rs708272. (5) Using SHEsis software analysis, the five A/T/A/A/T/C/A/G, A/T/A/A/T/T/G/A, G/G/A/G/C/C/G/G, G/G/C/G/C/C/A/G and G/G/C/G/C/T/G/G haplotypes were between dyslipidemia group and control group statistically significantly different (
