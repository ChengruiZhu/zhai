Isavuconazole, the active moiety of the water-soluble prodrug isavuconazonium sulfate, is a triazole antifungal agent for the treatment of invasive fungal infections. The purpose of this analysis was to characterize the isavuconazole exposure-response relationship for measures of efficacy and safety in patients with invasive aspergillosis and infections by other filamentous fungi from the SECURE clinical trial. Two hundred thirty-one patients who received the clinical dosing regimen and had exposure parameters were included in the analysis. The primary drug exposure parameters included were predicted trough steady-state plasma concentrations, predicted trough concentrations after 7 and 14 days of drug administration, and area under the curve estimated at steady state (AUCss). The exposure parameters were analyzed against efficacy endpoints that included all-cause mortality through day 42 in the intent-to-treat (ITT) and modified ITT populations, data review committee (DRC)-adjudicated overall response at end of treatment (EOT), and DRC-adjudicated clinical response at EOT. The safety endpoints analyzed were elevated or abnormal alanine aminotransferase, increased aspartate aminotransferase, and a combination of the two. The endpoints were analyzed using logistic regression models. No statistically significant relationship (
