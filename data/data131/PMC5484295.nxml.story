In testing the hypothesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD)‐like pathology in late stage traumatic brain injury (TBI), we evaluated AD pathological markers in late stage TBI model. Sprague–Dawley male rats were subjected to moderate controlled cortical impact (CCI) injury, and 6 months later euthanized and brain tissues harvested. Results from H&E staining revealed significant 33% and 10% reduction in the ipsilateral and contralateral hippocampal CA3 interneurons, increased MHCII‐activated inflammatory cells in many gray matter (8–20‐fold increase) and white matter (6–30‐fold increased) regions of both the ipsilateral and contralateral hemispheres, decreased cell cycle regulating protein marker by 1.6‐ and 1‐fold in the SVZ and a 2.3‐ and 1.5‐fold reductions in the ipsilateral and contralateral dentate gyrus, diminution of immature neuronal marker by two‐ and onefold in both the ipsilateral and contralateral SVZ and dentate gyrus, and amplified amyloid precursor protein (APP) distribution volumes in white matter including corpus callosum, fornix, and internal capsule (4–38‐fold increase), as well as in the cortical gray matter, such as the striatum hilus, SVZ, and dentate gyrus (6–40‐fold increase) in TBI animals compared to controls (
