, genes are frequently organized into convergent pairs that are transcribed from opposing DNA strands in opposite directions and have overlapping 3′-UTRs. Here we explore the negative correlation in expression levels between convergent genes using a set of 645 convergent pairs in the yeast genome, identified from published genomic and transcriptomic sequence data and accounting for ∼20% of total yeast genes. Analysis of published microarray experiments confirmed that the negative correlation in expression between convergent genes occurs across a broad range of growth conditions. This implies that such transcriptional interference is an important means of regulating gene expression in yeast, especially in the absence of other eukaryotic RNA-dependent mechanisms such as micro RNAs. We focused on profiling the expression of four pairs of convergent genes in wild type yeast and its genetically modified strains, to explore the causes and mechanisms of transcriptional interference. We demonstrate that the 3′-UTR sequence alone plays the essential and causal role in interference between convergent genes. Intriguingly, transcriptional interference occurs even when one of the convergent genes is expressed from elsewhere in the genome (in
