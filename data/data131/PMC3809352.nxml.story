Receptor for advanced glycation end-products is implicated in a development of chronic inflammatory response. Aim of this paper is to provide a review on commercial and experimental medicines that can interfere with RAGE and signaling through RAGE. We searched three bibliographical databases (PubMed, Web of Science and MEDLINE) for the publications from 2005 to March 2012 and identified 5 major groups of agents that can interfere with RAGE biological effects. In the first part of this paper, we discuss AGE crosslink breakers. These chemicals destroy advanced glycation end products (AGEs) that are crosslinked to the extracellular matrix proteins and can interact with RAGE as ligands. Then, we describe two non-conventional agents SAGEs and KIOM-79 that abolish certain biological effects of RAGE and have a strong anti-inflammatory potential. In the third part, we evaluate the inhibitors of the signaling cascades that underlie RAGE. Particularly, we discuss two groups of kinase inhibitors tyrphostins and the inhibitors of JAK kinases. Considering RAGE as a potential master regulator of processes that are crucial for the pathogenesis of psoriasis, we propose that these medicins may help in controlling the disease by abolishing the chronic inflammation in skin lesions.
