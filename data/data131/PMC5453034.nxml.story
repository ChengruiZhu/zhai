) -knockout (KO) breast samples compared with control samples were identified. The Database for Annotation, Visualization and Integrated Analysis was used for the functional enrichment analysis of the DEGs. Bowtie 2 and model-based analysis of ChIP-Seq version 14 (macs14) were used for the mapping of raw reads and the identification of G9A binding sites (peaks), respectively. In addition, overlapping genes between the DEGs and genes in the peaks located in âˆ’3000 to 3000 bp centered in the transcription start sites (conpeaks) were screened out and microRNAs (miRNAs) believed to regulate those overlaps were identified through the TargetScan database. A total of 217 DEGs were identified in G9A-KO samples, which were mainly involved in the biological processes and pathways associated with the inflammatory response and cancer progression. A total of 10,422 peaks, containing 1,210 conpeaks involving 1,138 genes, were identified. Among the 1,138 genes, 15 were overlapped with the DEGs, and 35 miRNAs were identified to regulate those overlaps. Insulin-induced gene 1 was regulated by 9 genes in the miRNA-gene regulation network, which may indicate its importance in the progression of BC. The present study identified potential biomarkers of BC that may be useful in the diagnosis and treatment of patients with the disease.
