 consisting of an equal number of matched HFx patients who were not readmitted for at least 90 days since discharge. A network-wide analysis revealed nine patient/comorbidity co-clusters, of which two had a significantly different proportion of cases compared to the rest of the data. A cluster-specific analysis of the most significant co-cluster revealed that a pair of comorbidities (Renal Failure and Diabetes with no Complications) within the co-cluster had significantly higher risk of 30-day readmission, whereas another pair of comorbidities (Renal Failure and Diabetes with Renal or Peripheral Circulatory Manifestations), despite having a relatively more serious comorbidity, did not confer a higher risk. This counter-intuitive result suggests that HFx patients with more serious comorbidities may have better follow-up that reduces the risk of 30-day readmission, whereas those with specific relatively less-serious comorbidities may have less stringent follow-up resulting in unanticipated incidents that precipitate readmission. These analyses reveal the strengths and limitations of bipartite networks for identifying hypotheses for complex phenomena related to readmissions, with the goal of improving follow-up care for patients with specific combinations of comorbidities.
