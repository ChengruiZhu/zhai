Periarterial connective tissue with a moderate amount of collagen fibrils is known to be a specialized domain in the renal interstitium. This study aimed to clarify the microscopic architecture of the periarterial connective tissue as a mechanical supportive structure of the intrarenal arteries. Transmission and scanning electron microscopy revealed two populations of collagen fibrils in the periarterial connective tissue. The major one was composed of many bundles of collagen fibrils running in longitudinal directions, whereas the minor one was represented by a few circumferential bundles adjacent to the smooth muscles. The amount of collagen fibrils was obviously variable and correlated with the arterial caliber. The correlation between abundance of collagen fibrils and the arterial caliber was confirmed by morphometric analysis of the collagen fibril area per arterial perimeter on electron micrographs. The size of individual collagen fibrils was measured in periarterial connective tissue of arteries with various calibers. A positive correlation between the diameter of collagen fibrils and arterial caliber was confirmed, indicating the supportive function of collagen fibrils in the periarterial connective tissue. The accumulated morphological findings supported the hypothesis that the collagen fibrils in the periarterial connective tissue develop longitudinal tension with their tensile strength, whereas the smooth muscle cells in the media develop circumferential tension with active regulation of contracting force.
