A 36-year-old lady presented with redness and decreased vision in right eye since 6 months. She was earlier diagnosed of cavitary lung lesion, presumed secondary to tuberculosis and treated with anti-tubercular treatment for 4 months. Examination of affected right eye revealed nil light perception, conjunctival congestion with an exuberant mass in the inferotemporal bulbar conjunctiva, proptosis, iris neovascularization, 360Â° closed angles, intraocular pressure of 48 mm Hg, exudative retinal detachment, uveal mass and orbital extension. A diagnostic needle biopsy of uveal mass revealed malignant cells. Computed tomography-guided lung biopsy revealed squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), indicating metastatic spread from the orbit. She underwent lid-sparing exenteration of the right eye. Histopathological examination of the orbital tissue revealed mucoepidermoid carcinoma arising from the conjunctiva with extensive invasion into the orbital tissue, muscle fibers, sclera, choroid and optic nerve. Multiple tumor emboli were seen in the lumen of orbital blood vessels. In conclusion, mucoepidermoid carcinoma of the conjunctiva is a rare, aggressive variant of SCC. Early intervention is essential to prevent intraocular invasion and systemic metastasis.
