The role of autophagy in cancers is controversial. Here we aim to determine the prognostic significance of autophagy in colorectal carcinoma patients, thereby allowing more rational development of therapeutic strategies. Through transmission electron microscopy, our data first demonstrated high frequency of defective mitochondria was strongly associated with poor overall survival in colorectal carcinoma. Next immunohistochemical study showed the expressions of Beclin 1, LC3B and Bcl-xL in both the center of tumor and adjacent noncancerous mucosal region were also correlated with overall survivals. We developed an autophagy signature for prognosis based on these three major autophagic proteins, further analysis suggested it was an independent prognostic biomarker and had its value even within single clinical stage. Combined TNM stage and this signature could significantly improve the accuracy of survival prognosis. To validate these immunohistochemical results, an internal testing cohort and an independent population were also included. Our findings suggest that autophagy plays an important role in the clinical cancer progression. Therefore autophagic proteins may be valuable prognostic biomarkers in the therapy of colorectal carcinoma and possibly other types of cancers.
