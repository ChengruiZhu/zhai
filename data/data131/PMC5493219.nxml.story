Twenty members from 19 facilities in 14 countries responded to the survey. Twelve members (60%) belonged to a multidisciplinary breast cancer team. Radiotherapy equipment was available in seven facilities (36%), but equipment had down time at least once a week in four facilities. Available chemotherapy drugs included methotrexate, cyclophosphamide, fluorouracil, anthracyclines, and vincristine, whereas trastuzumab, taxanes, vinorelbine, and gemcitabine were available in few facilities. Core-needle biopsy was available in 16 facilities (84%); mammogram, in 17 facilities (89%); computed tomography scan, in 15 facilities (79%); magnetic resonance imaging, in 11 facilities (58%); and bone scans, in nine facilities (47%). It took an average of 1 to 3 weeks to report histopathology. Immunohistochemistry was available locally in eight facilities (42%), outside hospitals but within the country in seven facilities (37%), and outside the country in four facilities (21%). Thirteen facilities (68%) performed axillary node dissections as part of a breast protocol. Neoadjuvant chemotherapy was the most common therapy for locally advanced breast cancer in 13 facilities (68%). In three facilities (16%), receptor status did not influence the prescription of hormone treatment.
