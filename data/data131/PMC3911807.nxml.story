Chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) can lead to serious long-term adverse sequelae, particularly if left untreated. The aim of this study was to describe a series of intracranial mucoceles (ICMs) that arose in the context of longstanding CRS combined with a review of the pertinent literature. A retrospective chart review was performed on all patients who developed ICMs in association with CRS between 2003 and 2012. The clinical presentation, radiographic features, surgical approach, intraoperative findings, and patient outcome were examined in the context of a literature review. Sixty-five cases of mucoceles were identified in patients with a history of CRS, of which seven (10.8%) were intracranial. Five patients were men and two were women with a mean age of 42.1 years. Headache, facial pressure, retro-orbital pain, and visual disturbances were the most common presenting symptoms. Five of the seven had previously undergone sinonasal surgery. Imaging studies showed ICMs involving the anterior cranial fossa, two of which were bilateral. Latency between onset of CRS and ICM detection ranged from 3 to 19 years (mean, 9.4 years). All patients underwent endoscopic transnasal drainage with three also requiring a concurrent, open neurosurgical procedure to access the intracranial component. There were no postoperative complications, and no recurrences were observed after a mean follow-up of 2.7 years. ICMs presenting as delayed complications of CRS are uncommon and constitute a surgical challenge. Open, external skull base approaches used in conjunction with transnasal endoscopic drainage procedures may be necessary to achieve successful management of this rare condition.
