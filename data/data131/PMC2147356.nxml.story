) Under the conditions of the experiments described, a fraction of the radioiron, constant for each animal, is reutilized in new red cell formation when released by red cell destruction. This mathematical analysis indicates the following average life spans with the respective standard errors of the mean: dog 107 days ± 1.14; rabbit 67.6 days ± 1.94; cat 68.4 ± 1.50. The mathematical treatment presented has permitted a consideration of the theoretical variation of red cell life spans which was found in these experiments to be relatively small for all three species studied. In the rabbit and cat 2.5 per cent of tagged populations of red cells of the same age would theoretically have disappeared by senescence 17 days before the average life span was reached. The variation of red cell life in the dog was slightly less. Animals of the three species studied, in spite of apparently normal health, exhibited varying degrees of random destruction of both autogenous and transfused fresh normal homologous red cells. As yet, we have no explanation for this random loss of cells occurring in apparently healthy normal animals. The method of mathematical analysis presented is applicable to animal red cell survival studies employing radioiron in which differing rates of random destruction are operating in the removal of red cells.
