The genome of eukaryotic cells is packaged into nucleosomes consisting of an octamer of histone proteins that is wrapped around by DNA. Histone proteins are often modified with chemical groups that can influence the arrangement of nucleosomes and thereby affect DNA-based processes like transcription. Histone N-terminal acetylation, which comprises the addition of a chemical group at the tip of the histone tail, is an abundant modification whose function is unknown. In this work, we show that N-terminal acetylation of histone H4 can strongly inhibit the occurrence of a neighboring modification, namely dimethylation at the third arginine. To do this, N-terminal acetylation cooperates with other internal lysine acetylation marks. We find that the communication amongst these histone modifications is necessary for controlling the expression of ribosomal RNA genes that are required for protein synthesis and cell growth. Our experiments show that in the absence of both N-terminal acetylation and lysine acetylation there is a strong increase in H4 arginine 3 dimethylation levels leading to cell lethality. This growth defect can be rescued by a point mutation on H4 that blocks methylation at position 3. Together, our results unveil a molecular and biological function for the previously uncharacterized N-terminal acetylation of histones.
