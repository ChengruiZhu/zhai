C NMR, and mass spectroscopy have been used to justify their proposed chemical structures, which were in agreement with the single crystal structure of Bmpp-Dh earlier reported according to X-ray crystallography. The single crystal structure of 4-acetyl-3-methyl-1-phenyl--pyrazoline-5-one phenylhydrazone Ampp-Ph, which crystallizes in a triclinic crystal system with a P-1 (No. 2) space group is presented. Octahedral Mn(II), Ni(II), Co(II), and Cu(II) complexes of these respective ligands with two molecules each of the bidentate Schiff base, coordinating to the metal ion through the azomethine nitrogen C=N and the keto oxygen C=O, which were afforded by the reaction of aqueous solutions of the corresponding metal salts with the ligands are also reported. Their identity and proposed structures were according to elemental analysis, FTIR spectroscopy, UV-VIS spectrophotometry (electronic spectra) and Bohr magnetic moments, as well as thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) results. A look at the antibacterial and antioxidant activities of synthesized compounds using the methods of the disc diffusion against some selected bacterial isolates and 1,1-diphenyl-2-picryl-hydrazil (DPPH) respectively, showed biological activities in relation to employed standard medicinal drugs.
