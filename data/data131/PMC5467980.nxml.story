An institutional review broad approval was granted by the Cleveland Clinic Health System. In our study, 216 patients with CHB presenting to Fairview Hospital between January 2014 and June 2016 were initially identified using the International Classification of Disease (ICD) codes at discharge. Only the patients with a new diagnosis of complete heart block (CHB) were included in the study (total N=62), which led to the exclusion of 154 patients. The patients were characterized into non-ischemic and ischemic groups based on cardiac marker elevation, electrocardiogram changes and/or cardiac catheterization findings. In all the patients, data including the following was collected: demographics such as age, gender, ethnicity and body mass index; pre-existing comorbidities such as hypertension, chronic kidney disease, diabetes mellitus, thyroid disease, previous coronary artery disease, history of cancer; use of nodal blocking agents, electrolyte abnormalities on admission, echocardiographic parameters such as ejection fraction (EF), right ventricular systolic pressure (RVSP), left ventricular end diastolic and systolic volumes (LVEDV and LVESV, respectively). The primary outcome was all-cause mortality and the secondary outcome was pacemaker placement. Categorical variables were analyzed using chi-square and continuous variables using ANOVA.
