In several tumors the transketolase activity, controlled inter alia by enzymes of the pentose phosphate pathway which is an alternative, energy generating reaction-cascade to glycolysis, has been correlated with proliferation. The increase of thiamine-dependant transketolase enzyme reactions is induced especially through upregulated transketolase-like enzyme 1 (TKTL1)-activity; that shows TKTL1 to be a causative enzyme for tumors enhanced, anaerobic glucose degradation. We investigated TKTL1-expression in 88 human, formalin-fixed non-small cell lung cancer tissues and 24 carcinomas of the breast by immunohistochemical stainings applying a 0 to 3 staining-score system (3 = strongest expression). For means of validation we additionally stained 40 NSCLC fixed and paraffin-embedded utilizing the HOPE-technique; showing comparable results to the formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded specimens (not shown). Potential correlations with age, sex, TNM-classification parameters and tumor grading as well as tumor transcription factor 1 (TTF1) and surfactant protein A (SPA) expression were investigated. 40.9% of the analyzed lung tumors expressed TKTL1 weakly (Score 1), 38.6% moderately (score 2) and 17.1% strongly (score 3). 3 tumors were diagnosed TKTL1-negative (3.4%; score 0). All Breast cancer specimen stainings were positive and scored 1: 32%; scored 2: 36%; scored 3: 32%. Alveolar macrophages and Alveolar Epithelial Cells Type II were also found to be TKTL1-positive.
