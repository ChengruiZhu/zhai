High intraocular pressure (HIOP)-induced retinal ischemia was established in Wistar rats by raising their intraocular pressure to 120 mmHg for 60 min with in an eye whose anterior chamber was cannulated with a 30-guage needle adapted to a normal saline bottle through an intravenous line. This ischemic insult was followed by 1 or 7 days of reperfusion. The effects of CJDHW were studied by (i) electroretinogram (ERG); (ii) real-time polymerase chain reaction to determine the retinal mRNA levels of Thy-1 and matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9); (iii) Western blot analysis to determine the retinal protein levels of B cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2), heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1), phosphorylated-p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (P-p38 MAPK) and MMP-9; (iv) hematoxylin and eosin (HE) staining; (v) fluorogold retrograde labeling; and (vi) terminal deoxynucleotidyl-transferase (TdT)-mediated dUTP nick end-labeling (TUNEL) apoptosis assay. Moreover, after fixation with 4 % paraformaldehyde and 30 % sucrose, the isolated retinas were sectioned and immunolabeled with goat anti-choline acetyltransferase (ChAT) polyclonal antibody, mouse anti-vimentin monoclonal antibody and rabbit anti-glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) polyclonal antibody. The retinal sections were then incubated with rhodamine-conjugated rabbit anti-goat antibody, fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG or FITC-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG. A daily oral intake of 3 mL of water (vehicle; Group 2) or CJDHW (2.8 or 4.2 g/kg/day; CJDHW2.8 or CJDHW4.2; Group 3 or 4) was given for 7 consecutive days either before (preischemic drug administration) or after HIOP-induced retinal ischemic injury (postischemic drug administration). In Group 5, an intravitreal injection of 4 μL of 0.5 mM SB203580 (p38 MAPK inhibitor) was performed on the ischemic eye 15 min before retinal ischemia. The control rats received a sham procedure (Group 1) where the saline reservoir was not raised.
