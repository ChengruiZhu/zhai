The interaction between a T cell and an antigen-presenting cell (APC) can trigger a signaling response that leads to T cell activation. Prior studies have shown that ligation of the T cell receptor (TCR) triggers a signaling cascade that proceeds through the coalescence of TCR and various signaling molecules (e.g., the kinase Lck and adaptor protein LAT [linker for T cell activation]) into microdomains on the plasma membrane. In this study, we investigated another ligand–receptor interaction (CD58–CD2) that facilities T cell activation using a model system consisting of Jurkat T cells interacting with a planar lipid bilayer that mimics an APC. We show that the binding of CD58 to CD2, in the absence of TCR activation, also induces signaling through the actin-dependent coalescence of signaling molecules (including TCR-ζ chain, Lck, and LAT) into microdomains. When simultaneously activated, TCR and CD2 initially colocalize in small microdomains but then partition into separate zones; this spatial segregation may enable the two receptors to enhance signaling synergistically. Our results show that two structurally distinct receptors both induce a rapid spatial reorganization of molecules in the plasma membrane, suggesting a model for how local increases in the concentration of signaling molecules can trigger T cell signaling.
