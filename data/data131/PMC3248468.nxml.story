Sexual reproduction is prevalent among eukaryotes and involves the maintenance of different sexes within reproducing populations. Due to similarities to higher eukaryotes like animals and plants, fungi serve as adequate model systems to study sex determination, mate recognition, and mating type evolution. In fungi, sexual identity is determined by a few genes that reside at specific genomic regions. Those so-called mating type loci encode a pheromone-receptor system and heterodimerising transcription factors. Intensive studies of various model organisms uncovered important aspects of sex in fungi. However, comparative surveys that cover distinct phylogenetic groups within the fungal kingdom are still rare, leaving many questions unanswered about the diversity, specificity, and evolutionary transitions of fungal mating types. Here, we report on mating genetics and the specificity of mate recognition in the plant biotrophic basidiomycete family Ustilaginaceae. In our Ustilaginaceae-wide study, we unravel a conserved triallelic pheromone-receptor system that preserved interspecific sexual compatibility for more than 100 million years and most likely gave rise to the convergent evolution of biallelic mating type determinations. Moreover, our results demonstrate that grass smuts represent a valuable model group to study the hybrid-based genesis of novel genotypes and their evolutionary impact on speciation.
