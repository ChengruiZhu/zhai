Movement in organisms is a result of the interplay between biomechanics, neural control, and the influence of external environmental loads. Understanding the interaction between these factors is important not only for scientific reasons but also for engineering robotic systems and prostheses that strive to match biological performance. Muscle mechanical impedance is key in defining the mechanical interaction between muscles and their loads. It is well known that neural activation modulates muscle impedance, particularly stiffness, and that such modulation can be used advantageously to stabilize the posture and motion in organisms. Here, we show computationally and experimentally that stiffness modulation can also be used to enhance the capability of muscle to generate mechanical power, which is key in determining how fast animals can run, fly, swim, or jump. When muscles are activated optimally in relation to their external loads, they can create resonance conditions at optimal frequencies that significantly enhance their mechanical energetics by up to 7-fold. These findings can be interpreted in the context of the engineering notions of impedance matching and resonance tuning, which are commonly used as guiding principles in the design of diverse power optimal systems, such as communication circuits and robotic systems.
