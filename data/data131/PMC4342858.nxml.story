A 63-year-old female patient presented to a local physician with pain in her back and epigastric region. An abdominal computed tomography (CT) scan revealed a pancreatic tumor, and the patient was referred to our hospital. Multiple imaging studies that included ultrasonography (US), CT, MRI, and endoscopic US revealed a cystic lesion 3â€“4 cm in size with node-like projections in the body of the pancreas. The distal main pancreatic duct was also found to be dilated. Endoscopic retrograde pancreatography revealed an irregular stenosis of the main pancreatic duct proximal to the cystic lesion, and malignancy was suspected. The patient was preoperatively diagnosed with pancreatic ductal carcinoma concomitant with intraductal papillary mucinous carcinoma, and a distal pancreatectomy was performed. Rapid pathological diagnosis during surgery revealed positive surgical margins for pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasia (PanIN). Further resection was performed twice, her surgical margin was positive and total pancreatectomy was ultimately conducted. Histopathological findings revealed diffuse microinvasive cancerous lesions corresponding to PanIN-2 (moderate dysplasia) to PanIN-3 (carcinoma in situ) throughout the pancreas. PanIN involves microlesions of the ductal epithelium that may precede pancreatic cancer. Ascertaining changes in PanIN using images provided by diagnostic modalities such as CT and US is challenging. Ductal stenosis and distal cystic lesions resulting from atrophy and fibrosis of pancreatic tissue were noted around PanIN. Considering the possibility of PanIN, a precancerous lesion during differential diagnosis will help to improve early detection and prognosis for patients with pancreatic cancer.
