Patients with cancer are at increased risk of thrombosis. Additionally, an increased mean platelet volume (MPV) has been demonstrated to be associated with thromboembolism. Tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) may modulate the activation of systemic coagulation in cancer patients, rendering them more susceptible to thromboembolism. The aim of the current study was to investigate the association between antiangiogenic TKIs and MPV. A total of 45 patients with metastatic renal cell carcinoma (RCC), who were treated with TKIs and were patients at the Akdeniz University Hospital and Afyon Kocatepe University Ahmet Necdet Sezer Research and Practice Hospital, were retrospectively reviewed. The results prior to treatment and after three months for the MPV values and platelet levels were evaluated. The MPV values increased following the treatment with TKIs; however, no statistically significant difference was observed between the baseline and three month values (P=0.286). Conversely, a significant decrease was observed in the platelet levels following treatment (P=0.005). Treatment with TKIs in patients with metastatic RCC caused a modest increase in MPV, which is an indicator of thrombocytic reactivity; however, further studies are required to validate these results.
