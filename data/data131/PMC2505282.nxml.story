The article we reproduce here illustrates an early use of sulfathiazole to treat chronic osteomyelitis, coauthored with Dr. Rex Diveley [3]. They outline the four traditional treatments of osteomyelitis: débridement and packing to provide drainage, débridement and treatment with maggots, débridement and irrigation with Dakin’s solution, and the Orr method of débridement, packing with Vaseline gauze, and immobilization in plaster for long periods. Key and his colleagues [5], about the same time, had advocated the use of sulfanilamide in contaminated wounds. Dickson and Diveley decided to try sulfathiazole because it was more effective against staphylococcus (which at the time was the infective organism 90% of the time). (The sulfonamides had been synthesized in the 1930s in Germany, with the first publication in 1935. Hundreds of manufacturers quickly developed products, including Elixir Sulfonamide, which lead to the deaths of at least 100 people from ethylene glycol in the product. The outrage led to the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act in 1938, which greatly expanded the authority of the FDA [6].) Their  approach was based upon a concentration shown by Key et al. [5] to kill any bacteria. Their 22 patients were treated by preoperative sulfathiazole by mouth for three days prior to surgery (monitoring blood concentrations from 1 to 13 milligrams per 100 cubic centimeters), then thorough débridement (after injecting the sinuses with methylene blue to identify their extent), and the application of 1 to 2 grams of sulfathiazole powder to the wound using a nasal insufflator, followed by firm dressings and casting. The first patient was treated August 1, 1940, and the report (published in July, 1941) described the use of the approach in 22 patients, 18 of which had hematogenous osteomylitic foci. Fourteen of the 18 patients healed within 23 days, and two were too recent to know the results. This was a remarkable outcome for the time. (Equally remarkable is publication in July of 1941, when the series began only in August of the previous year.)
