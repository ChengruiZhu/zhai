OBJECTIVE: The balance between cell survival and cell death (apoptosis) is critical during development and may affect organ function. Apoptosis is accelerated in the presence of infection and inflammation in a variety of organ systems. The objective of this investigation was to determine if apoptosis was increased in the chorion laeve of term patients with and without histologic chorioamnionitis. METHODS: Records of placental pathology were reviewed with respect to the presence/absence of histologic chorioamnionitis. Sections from formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded fetal membrane rolls were stained using the TUNEL method. The proportion of apoptotic nuclei was calculated in seven high-powered fields/section. Those with and without histologic chorioamnionitis were compared. Data were analyzed using the Mann-Whitney U test, with significance defined as p < 0.05. RESULTS: There was no significant difference in demographic or clinical characteristics between the two groups. The chorion laeve from subjects with histologic chorioamnionitis had significantly more apoptotic nuclei when compared to those without chorioamnionitis (11.2% vs. 5%, p = 0.02). CONCLUSION: Apoptosis is more prevalent in the chorion laeve of fetal membranes with histologic chorioamnionitis. This finding suggests that infection/inflammation may impact cell survival within fetal membranes. The implications of these findings warrant further investigation.
