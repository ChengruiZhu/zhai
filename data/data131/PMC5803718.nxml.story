Neuromyelitis optica, also known as Devic's disease, is an autoimmune disorder that leads to the inflammation and demyelination of nerves. Devic's disease primarily affects the optic nerve and spinal cord, but can lead to a significant loss of function throughout the body if not treated with steroid therapy or plasmapheresis. We recently saw a 62-year-old patient who received plasmapheresis for Devic's disease through a PTFE arteriovenous graft in her left arm. Her graft clotted without warning, and percutaneous thrombolysis was not successful. A new vascular access was achieved with the use of an immediate-cannulation PTFE graft, and the patient received plasmapheresis immediately after her operation. However, the patient returned within 2 weeks with a thrombosed graft. Extensive myointimal fibrosis was noted within the brachial artery and axillary vein during a graft thrombectomy. Subsequent placement of a new arteriovenous fistula in her contralateral arm was eventually successful. Myointimal fibrosis may be a sequela of symptomatic antibody-positive Devic's disease, and avoidance of synthetic materials may be indicated in this patient population to avoid exacerbation of an autoimmune response.
