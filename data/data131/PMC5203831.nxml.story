Expression of microRNAs is altered in cancer. Circulating miRNA level assessed in body fluids commonly reflects their expression in tumor cells. In leukemias, however, both leukemic and nonleukemic cells compose circulating miRNA expression profile of peripheral blood. The latter contribution to extracellular miRNA pool may result in specific microenvironmental signaling, which promotes proliferation and survival. In our study, we used qT-PCR to assay peripheral blood serum of 22 chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) patients for the expression of 84 miRNAs associated with activation and differentiation of B and T lymphocytes. Results were analyzed regarding the most important prognostic factors. We have found that the general expression of examined miRNAs in CLL patients was lower as compared to healthy volunteers. Only miR-34a-5p, miR31-5p, miR-155-5p, miR-150-5p, miR-15a-3p, and miR-29a-3p were expressed on a higher level. Alterations of expression observed in CLL patients involved miRNAs associated both with B and T lymphocyte differentiation and activation. The most important discriminating factors for all functional miRNA groups were trisomy 12, CD38 expression, B2M level, WBC, and
