There is a place for radical cystectomy in locally advanced T3b-T4 and N1-3 bladder cancer. Radical cystectomy alone rarely cures this subgroup of patients. There is increasing evidence that meticulous surgical clearance and extended lymphadenectomy has significant impact on disease-free survival. Adjuvant chemotherapy has been found to be effective in terms of recurrence-free survival and better than cystectomy alone. Neoadjuvant chemotherapy followed by radical cystectomy also has beneficial effects in terms of downstaging the disease and improving recurrence-free survival. This perioperative chemotherapy (adjuvant/neoadjuvant) has 5-7% survival benefit and 10% reduction in the death due to cancer disease. Excellent five-year survival rates have been achieved in patients achieving pT0 stage at surgery following chemotherapy (around 80%) and overall 40% five-year survival in node positive patients, which is promising. Though practiced widely, perioperative chemotherapy is not considered as a standard of care as yet. Current ongoing trials are likely to help us in reaching a consensus over this. There is no role of preoperative or postoperative radiotherapy in locally advanced/metastatic bladder cancer except in non TCC bilharzial/squamous cell carcinoma of bladder. Use of nomograms and prognostic factor evaluation may help us in the future in predicting the disease relapse and may help us in tailoring the treatment accordingly. Newer and more effective chemotherapeutic drugs and ongoing trials will have a significant impact on the treatment strategies and outcome of these patients in the future.
