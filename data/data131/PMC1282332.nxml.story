Bacterial genomes contain genes that come from two sources; although most genes are inherited directly from parent cells at cell division, others may come into the genome from an unrelated organism. Often, these foreign genes can be detected because their sequences have compositional properties that differ from those of other genes in the genome. Methods for detecting atypical genes are difficult to assess because there are no genuine genomes wherein the histories of all genes are known. Here, the authors describe a method for creating artificial genomes that mimic the properties of genuine genomes, including containing “foreign” genes. The researchers used these constructs (a) to evaluate existing methods for finding foreign genes based on their atypical properties and (b) to test a new method for finding atypical genes. The researchers found that existing methods differ in their abilities to detect genes from different sources and that combining different methods can improve overall performance. The new method for finding atypical genes—which also identified sets of genes that share their unusual properties—worked very well in identifying potentially foreign genes in artificial, chimeric genomes.
