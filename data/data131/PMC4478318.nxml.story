Pauci-immune crescentic glomerulonephritis (PICGN) is most commonly associated with antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (ANCA). We report a case of chronic, sclerosing ANCA-negative PICGN discovered when a patient presented with multiple myeloma. A 57-year-old woman presented with complaints of nausea, emesis and weakness. She was found to be in renal failure with a serum creatinine of 9.4 mg/dl, mild hyperkalemia and acidosis. She was noted to have normochromic, normocytic anemia with normal platelet and white cell counts, normal plasma proteins and serum protein electrophoresis. Further studies revealed increased concentrations of κ and λ light chains in a ratio of 34.89; a bone marrow biopsy found 12% plasma cells. Serum protein electrophoresis revealed no spike. ANCA, anti-glomerular basement membrane, antineutrophil antibody, hepatitis panel and serum complements were normal. A kidney biopsy result showed chronic sclerosing PICGN plus tubular necrosis, severe tubular atrophy, interstitial fibrosis and severe arteriosclerosis. Congo red stains were negative and electron microscopy showed no intraglomerular deposits. The patient was subsequently treated for myeloma with bortezomib and dexamethasone with good hematologic response but never recovered renal function. She remains on outpatient hemodialysis. Renal manifestations of myeloma often involve glomerular deposition disease, tubulointerstitial disease, with characteristic proteinaceous casts, or both. In contrast, our patient demonstrated neither of these findings but had chronic sclerosing PICGN. Crescentic glomerulonephritis occurring in patients with plasma cell dyscrasias has been previously reported, but the association remains extremely rare.
