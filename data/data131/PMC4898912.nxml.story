Meckel’s diverticulum is a real diverticulum located at the antimesenteric portion of intestinal loops and including all layers of the intestinal wall. It is the most common congenital anomaly of the gastrointestinal tract, and its incidence is 1–3%. Many asymptomatic cases are diagnosed when complications occur. A 23-year-old female patient applied to gynaecology emergency clinic with pelvic pain complaint. Laparotomy was performed with the diagnosis of acute abdomen because the physical examination and imaging studies did not exclude tuboovary pathology. Giant Meckel’s diverticulitis and ischemic bowel loops that had been torsion were observed. Obstruction is the most common complication and generally originates from inflammation, adhesions, intussusception and omphalo-mesenteric band. In this case, it was seen that mobilized diverticulitis can be complicated without any fibrous band or adhesion to adjacent organs. This case supports that there can be torsion of bowel in free Meckel’s diverticulum. Meckel’s diverticulum settled in the pelvic region can make a clinical manifestation that is difficult to distinguish from adnexal diseases. It should be kept in mind for cases that start with pelvic pain, form adnexal pathology suspicion and cause an acute abdomen.
