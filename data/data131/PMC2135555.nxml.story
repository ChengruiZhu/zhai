 These investigations are part of an attempt to study and interpret the intermediary metabolism of the kidneys in experimental renal hypertension. Hypertension was produced in dogs by the clamping procedure of Goldblatt and associates or by the silk perinephritis method of Page. Enzymatic studies were made by means of Warburg's manometric method. Cytochrome c was in addition determined spectrophotometrically. Tissue slices, homogenized tissue, and tissue extracts were used. A study of the cytochrome c concentration and the activities of the cytochrome oxidase and succinic dehydrogenase systems of kidneys from normal dogs and dogs with experimental renal hypertension was made. It was found that the cytochrome c concentration and the activities of the cytochrome oxidase and succinic dehydrogenase systems were markedly lower in the kidney slices and in the tissue suspensions from hypertensive dogs. Tissue suspensions and extracts of kidneys from hypertensive dogs showed an inhibitory effect on the activity of the cytochrome oxidase and succinic dehydrogenase, and the amine oxidase systems. Renin preparations also showed a marked inhibitory effect on the activities of cytochrome oxidase, succinic dehydrogenase,
