 1. In native egg albumin no SH groups are detectable, whereas in completely coagulated albumin as many groups are detectable as are found in the hydrolyzed protein. In egg albumin partially coagulated by heat the soluble fraction contains no detectable groups, and the insoluble fraction contains the number found after hydrolysis. 2. In the reversal of denaturation of serum albumin, when insoluble protein regains its solubility, S-S groups which have been detectable in the denatured protein, disappear. 3. When egg albumin coagulates at an air-water interface, all the SH groups in the molecule become detectable. 4. In egg albumin coagulated by irradiation with ultraviolet light, the same number of SH groups are detectable as in albumin coagulated by a typical denaturing agent. 5. When serum albumin is denatured by urea, there is no evidence that S-S groups appear before the protein loses its solubility. 6. Protein denaturation is a definite chemical reaction: different quantitative methods agree in estimates of the extent of denaturation, and the same changes are observed in the protein when it is denatured by different agents. A protein molecule is either native or denatured. The denaturation of some proteins can be reversed.
