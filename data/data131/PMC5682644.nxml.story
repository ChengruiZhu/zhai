Autophagy has an important renoprotective function and we recently found that autophagy inhibition is involved in cadmium (Cd)-induced nephrotoxicity. Here, we aimed to investigate the protective effect of trehalose (Tre), a novel autophagy activator, against Cd-induced cytotoxicity in primary rat proximal tubular (rPT) cells. First, data showed that Tre treatment significantly decreased Cd-induced apoptotic cell death of rPT cells via inhibiting caspase-dependent apoptotic pathway, evidenced by morphological analysis, flow cytometric and immunoblot assays. Also, administration with Tre protected rPT cells against Cd-induced lipid peroxidation. Inhibition of autophagic flux in Cd-exposed rPT cells was markedly restored by Tre administration, demonstrated by immunoblot analysis of autophagy marker proteins and GFP and RFP tandemly tagged LC3 method. Resultantly, Cd-induced autophagosome accumulation was obviously alleviated by Tre treatment. Meanwhile, blockage of autophagosomeâ€“lysosome fusion by Cd exposure was noticeably restored by Tre, which promoted the autophagic degradation in Cd-exposed rPT cells. Moreover, Tre treatment markedly recovered Cd-induced lysosomal alkalinization and impairment of lysosomal degradation capacity in rPT cells, demonstrating that Tre has the ability to restore Cd-impaired lysosomal function. Collectively, these findings demonstrate that Tre treatment alleviates Cd-induced cytotoxicity in rPT cells by inhibiting apoptosis and restoring autophagic flux.
