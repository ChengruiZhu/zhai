Gene-activating compounds upregulating functions of liver endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and affecting lipid and protein metabolism, increase ER size through membrane synthesis, and produce an antiatherogenic plasma lipoprotein profile. Numerous gene-activators regress atherosclerosis and reduce the occurrence of atherosclerotic disease. The gene-activators increase glucose disposal rate and insulin sensitivity and, by restoring normal glucose and insulin levels, remove metabolic syndrome and DM2. Patients with DM2 show an improvement of plasma lipoprotein profile and glucose tolerance together with increase in liver phospholipid (PL) and cytochrome (CYP) P450. The gene-activating compounds induce hepatic protein and PL synthesis, and upregulate enzymes including CYPs and glucokinase, nuclear receptors, apolipoproteins and ABC (ATP-binding cassette) transporters. They induce reparation of ER structures and eliminate consequences of ER stress. Healthy living habits activate mechanisms that maintain high levels of HDL and apolipoprotein AI, promote health, and prevent cognitive decline and dementia. Agonists of liver X receptor (LXR) reduce amyloid in brain plaques and improve cognitive performance in mouse models of Alzheimer`s disease.
