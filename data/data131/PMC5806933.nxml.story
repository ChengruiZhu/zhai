The predominant age group for the 150-patient cohort was the younger 17-65 years of age category, which was represented by 94 (62.7%). The 150-patient group had slightly more males, 79 (52.7%). The majority of 111 (74%) patients had an ECOG score of 1, 39 (26%) had 1 ECD site and uncontrolled ECD occurred in 112 (74.7%). The main COD was ECD in 106 (70.7%). The prevalent tumor histology was non-small cell lung carcinoma (88 of 150, 58.7%). The most common TV was 0-0.5 ccs (48 of 150, 32%). The majority of 125 (83.3%) patients did not undergo post-CKRS WBRT. Imaging outcomes were local control (LC) (CR, PR, or stable imaging) in 119 (79.3%), of whom 38 (25.3%) had CR, 56 (37.3%) PR and 25 (16.7%) stable imaging; LF was the outcome in 31 (20.7%) and DBF occured in 83 (55.3%). The median OS was 13 months. Patients 17-65 years of age had a median OS of 13 months, while those 66-88 years, had 12 months. Females versus males had median OS of 15 versus 12 months. The most prolonged median OS of 21.5 months occurred in those with an ECOG score of 0. Patients with two ECD sites had a median OS of 14.5 months, while those with controlled ECD, 20.5 months. Patients with breast cancer brain metastases had the longest median OS of 23 months. The median OS for each of three (0-0.5 ccs, 0.6-1.5 ccs, 1.6-4.0 ccs) of four CKRS TV quartiles was 13 months and for those with 4.1-28.5 ccs, 10 months. Median OS for patients with versus without post-CKRS WBRT was 23 versus 12 months. The longest median OS of 18.5 months for post-CKRS imaging outcomes was in patients with CR; those with LF had a median OS of 11.5 months. Of nine patients with breast carcinoma brain metastases with available Ki-67s from primary tumor resections, the Ki-67 values were ≥ 34% for four patients with CR, PR and stable imaging outcomes, and < 34% for five patients with LF.
