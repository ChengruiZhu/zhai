The rapid pace of technological advances in DNA sequencing methods is leading to the discovery of genetic variants at a remarkable rate. Indeed, it is conceivable that entire individual genomes will be sequenced routinely in the near future. While these platforms greatly increase our ability to catalog variation, they are also creating a downstream need to efficiently process and filter this information to ultimately identify genetic causes underlying human disease. Since empirical evaluation of the biological effects of mutation is not practical at such a scale, computational methods that predict such effects are needed. In this paper, we describe a novel methodology to predict whether mutations that lead to amino acid substitutions in proteins will impact protein function and, therefore, may be more likely to have physiological consequences. Specifically, we use orthologous proteins to reconstruct the likely sequences of ancestral proteins in the human lineage. We found that the longer a position has been preserved from direct ancestors in the lineage leading to the human enzyme, the more likely that mutation at that site will have a deleterious effect. We demonstrated that the method should be generally applicable to all proteins.
