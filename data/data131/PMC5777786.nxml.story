Addition of induction chemotherapy (IC) to concurrent chemoradiotherapy (CCRT) is a potentially effective approach for treating locoregionally advanced nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC). In this study, we compared the efficacy and toxicity of IC regimens consisting of docetaxel plus cisplatin with (TPF) or without (TP) 5-fluorouracil followed by CCRT in these patients. Clinical data from 245 propensity score-matched pairs of newly diagnosed non-metastatic NPC patients who received either TPF or TP IC before CCRT were retrospectively reviewed. After a median follow-up of 60 months, 5-year locoregional relapse-free, distant metastasis-free, progression-free, and overall survival rates were 95.6%, 94.7%, 90.4%, and 92.9% in TPF arm patients and 96.7%, 94.2%, 91.7%, and 91.0% in TP arm patients, respectively. There were thus no differences in survival between the two arms. Multivariate analysis revealed that IC regimen was not an independent prognostic factor for any of the survival outcomes. However, patients who received TP experienced lower incidences of grade 3/4 toxicities than those who received TPF. These results indicate that omission of 5-fluorouracil from TPF-based IC did not affect survival outcomes, but was associated with reduced toxicity, in patients with locoregionally advanced NPC.
