There were 79 instances of meniscus tears in stable knees in a cohort of 9086 subjects from 2005-2012. Of these, 68 (86%) were in males and 11 (14%) in females. Right (40) and Left (39) knees were equally affected. The lateral meniscus (70%) was torn at a greater rate than medial meniscus (30%). Body mass index (BMI) of the meniscus injured population was 25.7 vs. 24.6 for the uninjured cohort (p less than .05). BMI was also greater in subjects with lateral (26.4) vs. medial (23.9) meniscus tears (p less than .05). The average time lost from activity was 102 days. Surgically managed injuries lost 112.7 days vs. 36.1 for non-operative cases (p less than .05). Of the operative cases, repairs lost 150.8 days vs. 101.0 for debridement (p less than .05). There was no significant difference in time lost from medial (90.9 days) vs. lateral (106.9 days) injuries. The greatest percentages of meniscus tears were found in football (19%), wrestling (13%) and rugby (9%) activities. Military combative training accounted for 5% of meniscus tears. The IR per 1000 AE for intercollegiate athletes was greatest in wrestling (0.157) and rugby (0.150). This was mirrored in the intramural population with rates of 0.125 and 0.138 respectively. Rates per AE in football were lower at 0.045 and 0.062 for intercollegiate and intramural competition.
