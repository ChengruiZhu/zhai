Histones are intra-nuclear cationic proteins that are present in all eukaryotic cells and are highly conserved across species. Within the nucleus, they provide structural stability to chromatin and regulate gene expression. Histone may be released into the extracellular space in three forms: freely, as a DNA-bound nucleosome or as part of neutrophil extracellular traps, and all three can be detected in serum after significant cellular death such as sepsis, trauma, ischaemia/reperfusion injury and autoimmune disease. Once in the extracellular space, histones act as damage-associated molecular pattern proteins, activating the immune system and causing further cytotoxicity. They interact with Toll-like receptors (TLRs), complement and the phospholipids of cell membranes inducing endothelial and epithelial cytotoxicity, TLR2/TLR4/TLR9 activation and pro-inflammatory cytokine/chemokine release via MyD88, NFÎºB and NLRP3 inflammasome-dependent pathways. Drugs that block the release of histone, neutralise circulating histone or block histone signal transduction provide significant protection from mortality in animal models of acute organ injury but warrant further research to inform future clinical applications.
