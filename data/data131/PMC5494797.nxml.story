 tumor cells, cell apoptosis, and autophagy were evaluated and quantified using fluorescent and transmission electron microscopy and flow cytometry. Hoechst-33258 fluorescence staining was used to evaluate apoptosis in treated and non-treated cell culture and xenograft NPC cells. Western blotting was performed on lysed tumor cells using primary antibodies to B-cell lymphoma-2 (Bcl-2), beclin-1, and β-actin, and flow cytometry results indicated cell apoptosis rates of 3.90±0.34 and 19.52±1.18% in the control and ApoG2-treated cells, respectively (F=485.294, P<0.001). Western blot analysis showed that ApoG2 significantly decreased expression of the Bcl-2 protein in CNE-2 cells, when compared with control cells (F=68.909, P=0.001) and flow cytometry showed cell autophagy rates of 0.92±3.10% of control cells compared with 28.24±7.35% of ApoG2-treated cells (F=31.035, P=0.003). ApoG2 treatment significantly increased beclin-1 protein expression in CNE-2 cells (F=497.906, P<0.001). ApoG2 treatment inhibited NPC xenograft tumor growth by 65.49% (P<0.05). In conclusion, these results support a role for ApoG2 in inhibiting the growth of human NPC cells by inducing apoptosis and autophagy. Future controlled clinical studies could be planned, to define safety, efficacy and dosing regimens for ApoG2 as a potential treatment for patients with NPC.
