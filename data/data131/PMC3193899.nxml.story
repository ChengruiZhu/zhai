 oncogene. The ducts of DCIS are abnormally filled with cells that evade apoptosis, but the underlying mechanisms remain incompletely understood. We overexpressed HER2 in mammary epithelial cells and observed growth factor-independent proliferation. When grown in extracellular matrix as 3- dimensional spheroids, control cells developed a hollow lumen, but HER2-overexpressing cells populated the lumen by evading apoptosis. We demonstrate that HER2 overexpression in this cellular model of DCIS drives transcriptional up-regulation of multiple components of the Notch survival pathway. Importantly, luminal filling required up-regulation of a signaling pathway comprising Notch3, its cleaved intracellular domain (NICD) and the transcriptional regulator HES1, resulting in elevated levels of c-MYC and Cyclin D1. In line with HER2- Notch3 collaboration, drugs intercepting either arm reverted the DCIS-like phenotype. In addition, we report up-regulation of Notch3 in hyperplastic lesions of HER2 transgenic animals, as well as an association between HER2 levels and expression levels of components of the Notch pathway in tumor specimens of breast cancer patients. Therefore, it is conceivable that the integration of the Notch and HER2 signaling pathways contributes to the pathophysiology of DCIS.
