To clarify the significance of expression of system L amino acid transporter 1 (LAT1) and 4F2 heavy chain (4F2hc) in the developing intestine, immunohistochemical investigation and molecular analysis were performed in the human embryonic and/or fetal intestines, ranging from 28–30 days to 34–35 weeks gestation. The molecular analysis for the expression of LAT1 and 4F2hc mRNAs was done in the pure epithelial cell samples prepared after laser assisted microdissection. The immunoreactivities against LAT1 and 4F2hc were detected along the basolateral cell membrane of the primitive gut epithelium at 28–30 days gestation. According to advance in gestational age of up to 24–25 weeks gestation, the immunoreactivity of LAT1 was predominantly observed in the supranuclear cytplasmic localization with a granular or dot-like staining pattern. Up to 8–9 weeks gestation, the immunoreactivity of 4F2hc showed almost the same as that of LAT1. However, after the age of 12–13 weeks gestation, the immunoreactivity of 4F2hc was predominantly localized along the cell membrane of apical surface of the epithelial cells. No apical and linear membranous localization of LAT1 was observed until nearly 20 weeks gestation. In the late gestational stage, both the immunoreactivities against LAT1 and 4F2hc were localized along the apical surface of the epithelial cells. In conclusion, the expression of LAT1 and 4F2hc in early developing intestine suggests they have a more important role in cell proliferation rather than functional differentiation. The predominant cytoplasmic localization of LAT1 during mid-fetal life seems to be largely inactive as amino acid transporter. On the other hand, the apical and linear membranous co-localization of LAT1 and 4F2hc in the late fetal life suggests that these molecules may play a role as a functional amino acid transporter in the fetal intestinal epithelium.
