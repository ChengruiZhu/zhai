., different Mendelian genes for constitutional vigor, etc. It has been possible to show by a study of the various sex classifications within the sex-intergrade class that the presence or absence of ovarian or testicular tissue as such is not the primary cause of the difference in the life duration in the type males and females but that the cause is to be found deeper, sex determination and duration of life accompanying each other and resulting from the common cause, chromosome constitution. The survival curve of the sex-intergrade groups present a limiting curve of duration of life, a constant death rate for each day of age. The curves have different rates of degeneration. To account for this fact it is necessary to assume that for these particular organisms a different organ in the two groups has assumed major significance to life due to the gene complex which causes their differentiation. Recurrent chance environmental and hereditary agents acting on organs generate the type of probability curve observed. Triploid flies are made up of cells which are one-third larger than the cells of the type flies. It is not without significance to note that such individuals show no greater or less duration of life than do the ordinary flies when both groups have their chromosomes in balance.
