Chromosomal DSBs caused by replication fork disruption, environmental factors, or endogenous nucleases are common yet potentially dangerous DNA lesions in all organisms. If they are repaired by homologous recombination (HR), the integrity of the genome is usually maintained. However, if the broken ends undergo NHEJ, sequences at the junction may be added, deleted, or substituted, and large segments of chromosomes can be rearranged. Partially overlapping sets of proteins are required for repair by either the HR or NHEJ pathway. Furthermore, different proteins may be used to process broken DNA ends, depending on the particular terminal structures. Since DNA synthesis occurs during HR in yeast and all three essential replicative polymerases are utilized, we asked how different polymerases might be involved in DSB repair by NHEJ. We find that Pol2, and particularly the enzyme's 3′ to 5′ nuclease activity, contributes to the removal of 3′ single strand flaps that can form during the initial joining of broken ends. We find that Pol1 and Pol3 modulate complex chromosomal rearrangements, and we confirm that Pol4 fills the gap that can form by imprecise pairing of overhanging 3′ DNA ends. Our work demonstrates that multiple DNA polymerases play important roles in NHEJ.
