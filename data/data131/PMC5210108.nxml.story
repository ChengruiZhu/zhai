Forensic odontology (FO) is a branch of forensic medicine that in the interest of justice deals with proper handling and examination of dental evidence. Teeth can survive in most conditions encountered at death and during decomposition, even when the body is exposed to extreme forces and/or temperatures. FO is being practiced worldwide since 1775, after which it has not only become an integral part of the judicial system of the developed countries but also been adopted by the armed forces and investigative agencies of these countries. In India, the awareness of FO is gaining pace since the last decade after the establishment of various organizations and the Dental Council of India making it a part of the curriculum. However, its identity as an individual endeavour is still to be established. Awareness and applicability of FO in the Indian Defense Forces would be of great help for better and accurate record keeping of the dedicated and vigilant warriors of our army. These records will be of great help for easy recognition of our army men at the time of calamities, wars, and other difficulties. It would also be useful in the identification of terrorists who enter our country and travel easily in disguise.
