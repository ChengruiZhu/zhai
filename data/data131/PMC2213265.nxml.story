 effector T cells in early central nervous system (CNS) lesions of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) by combining two-photon imaging and fluorescence video microscopy. We made two key observations: (a) the majority of the cells (65%) moved fast (maximal speed 25 μm/min) and apparently nondirected through the compact tissue; and (b) a second group of effector T cells (35%) appeared tethered to a fixed point. Polarization of T cell receptor and adhesion molecules (lymphocyte function-associated antigen 1) towards this fixed point suggests the formation of immune synapses. Nonpathogenic, ovalbumin-specific T cells were not tethered in the CNS and did not form synapse-like contacts, but moved through the tissue. After intrathecal injection of antigen, 40% of ovalbumin-specific T cells became tethered. Conversely, injection of anti–major histocompatibility complex class II antibodies profoundly reduced the number of stationary pathogenic T cells within the CNS (to 15%). We propose that rapid penetration of the CNS parenchyma by numerous autoimmune effector T cells along with multiple autoantigen-presentation events are responsible for the fulminate development of clinical EAE.
