The present study aimed to evaluate the prognostic significance of preoperative serum lactate dehydrogenase (SLDH) levels for resected gastric cancer and construct prognostic nomograms for risk prediction. The study cohort consisted of 619 patients with D2-resected gastric cancer. The relationship of SLDH levels with clinicopathological features and clinical outcomes was evaluated. Prognostic nomograms were created using identified prognosticators to predict 3-year overall survival (OS) and 3-year disease-free survival (DFS), and bootstrap validation was performed. High SLDH levels were correlated with old age but not depth of invasion or lymph node metastasis. When assessed as a continuous variable, high SLDH levels were independently associated with poor OS and DFS. Internal validation of the developed nomograms revealed good predictive accuracy (bootstrap-corrected concordance indices: 0.77 and 0.75, respectively for prediction of OS and DFS). The preoperative SLDH levels, an identified unfavorable prognosticator, were incorporated into nomograms along with other clinicopathological features to refine the prediction of clinical outcomes for patients with D2-resected gastric cancer.
