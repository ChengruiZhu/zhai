Molecular motors such as kinesin and dynein facilitate directed transport of intracellular cargo over tracks called microtubules. Inside cells, multiple motor proteins are known to bind and move cargoes. These teams of motors enable the transport of cargoes over longer distances, extending beyond the processive runlengths of a single motor. Impaired transport, possibly due to mutations that affect single motor parameters, is known to cause neurodegenerative diseases. A recent study reported that phosphorylation of a kinesin motor implicated in Huntingtonâ€™s disease, leads to a reduction in the single motor stalling force. In this work, we investigate how heterogeneity in motor stall forces can affect the coordinated transport properties of multi-motor ensembles. Our model predicts that motors with reduced stall force, even when in the minority, can determine emergent transport properties of average velocity and run-length. Under appropriate external loads, our analysis predicts that motor ensembles containing mutant motors travel longer distances, potentially contributing to the dysregulation of coordinated cargo transport, impairment of neuronal function and the onset of neurodegeneration. These results are enabled by development of a novel semi-analytic methodology to study cargo transport by multiple motors with distinct transport properties. This method is computationally less extensive than existing Monte-Carlo based approaches, easy to implement, and holds potential for understanding how individual motor proteins and properties contribute to the coordination of transport by motor ensembles.
