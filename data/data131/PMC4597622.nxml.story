The exclusion criteria in this study were multi-directional shoulder instability, wide osseous Bankart lesion, wide Hill-Sachs lesion or rotator cuff tear. All patients underwent arthroscopic Bankart repair. Knotless anchor was used in all patients. The patients were grouped into 2 groups postoperatively according to the immobilization period and rehabilitation regimen. Both groups equally consisted of 17 patients.

Gender, age, dislocated side, dominant hand, recurrence, presence of additional pathologies, time of first and last dislocations preoperatively and numbers of dislocations were the demographic data recorded.
