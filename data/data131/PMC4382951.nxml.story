<0.05). In the just-hatched Ussurian bullhead, the retina already consisted of six layers: the epithelial layer, ganglion cell layer, inner nuclear layer, inner plexiform layer, outer limiting membrane layer, and rod and cone layer. The Korean bullhead had the same components. At 50 DPH, the thickness of the retina was 538.0±7.19 μm in the Ussurian bullhead and 558.9±9.44 μm in the Korean bullhead. The relative thickness of each layer of the retina did not differ significantly in the two species. Although the growth of the Korean bullhead’s retina was faster, the relative thickness of each layer in the retina did not change during early development. After hatching, some parts of the tissue gradually became denser. Immediately after hatching, the kidney and midgut epithelium of the Ussurian bullhead and Korean bullhead were already formed and grew gradually thereafter. From 0 DPH to 30 DPH, the nuclear height in the midgut epithelium did not differ significantly between the two species, but at 50 DPH, it was 11.4±2.45 μm in the Korean bullhead and 9.9± 2.13 μm in the Ussurian bullhead. During the experimental period, the major axes, minor axes, surface areas, and volumes of the proximal tubule cells in the kidney did not differ significantly between the two species. Thus, the early histological development of the Ussurian bullhead is similar to that of the Korean bullhead.
