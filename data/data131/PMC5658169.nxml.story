The CRISPR-Cas9 system, a microbial adaptive immune system, was recently exploited for modulating DNA sequences within the endogenous genome in many organisms. This system has emerged as a technology of choice for genome editing with promising therapeutic and research advancements. However, these exciting developments were not paralleled by deep understanding of CRISPR-Cas9 cleavage efficiency. Indeed, while numerous studies have been conducted in order to define better guidelines to determine CRISPR-Cas9 specificity, much ambiguity remains surrounding its mechanism of action. Here, we present a machine-learning based algorithm that was trained on genome-wide experimental data. The algorithm considers a broad range of features that describe different attributes that potentially impact the cleavage efficacy of CRISPR-Cas9 including genomic attributes, RNA thermodynamics, and those concerning sequence similarity. We further found that incorporating the possibility for DNA or RNA bulges play an important role in prediction accuracy. Together, these result in a predictive model that can be used both to predict the cleavage propensity of a new genomic site according to the genomic context, as well as to learn on the importance of different features on CRISPR-Cas9 efficiency and selectivity.
