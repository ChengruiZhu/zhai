It has previously been reported that protein complexity (i.e. number of subunits in a protein complex) is negatively correlated to gene duplicability in yeast as well as in humans. However, unlike in yeast, protein connectivity in a protein–protein interaction network has a positive correlation with gene duplicability in human genes. In the present study, we have analyzed 1732 human and 1269 yeast proteins that are present both in a protein–protein interaction network as well as in a protein complex network. In the human case, we observed that both protein connectivity and protein complexity complement each other in a mutually exclusive manner over gene duplicability in a positive direction. Analysis of human haploinsufficient proteins and large protein complexes (complex size >10) shows that when protein connectivity does not have any direct association with gene duplicability, there exists a positive correlation between gene duplicability and protein complexity. The same trend, however, is not found in case of yeast, where both protein connectivity and protein complexity independently guide gene duplicability in the negative direction. We conclude that the higher rate of duplication of human genes may be attributed to organismal complexity either by increasing connectivity in the protein–protein interaction network or by increasing protein complexity.
