The migration of tumor cells through basement membranes and extracellular matrices is an integral component of tumor invasion and metastasis. Laminin and fibronectin are two basement membrane- and extracellular matrix-associated noncollagenous glycoproteins that have been shown to promote both cell adhesion and motility. Purified preparations of laminin and fibronectin stimulated the directed migration of B16 murine metastatic melanoma cells in vitro as assessed in modified Boyden chambers. The stimulation of migration occurred over a concentration range of 1-100 micrograms/ml of laminin or fibronectin, with a peak response occurring between 12.5 and 25 micrograms/ml. The maximal response of these cells was 80-120-fold higher than control migration. Affinity-purified antibody preparations specifically abrogated the migration of these cells in response to the respective proteins. Tumor cells in suspension were preincubated in physiologic levels of plasma fibronectin prior to assay to partially mimic what occurs when a metastasizing cell is in the blood stream. This preincubation with plasma fibronectin had no effect on the subsequent migration of cells in response to either laminin or fibronectin. Furthermore, experiments using filters precoated with fibronectin or laminin indicated that these cells could migrate by haptotaxis to these two proteins. We conclude that tumor cell migration in response to such noncollagenous adhesive glycoproteins could be an important aspect in the invasion and metastasis of certain malignant cell types.
