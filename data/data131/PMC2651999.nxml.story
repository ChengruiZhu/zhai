Androgen Receptor (AR) -signaling plays a critical role in the development and progression of prostate cancer. Tumor microvasculature contributes to continual exposure of prostate cancer cells to hypoxia-reoxygenation, however, the role of hypoxia-reoxygenation in prostate cancer progression and modulation of AR signaling is not understood. In the present study, we evaluated the effects of hypoxia-reoxygenation in LNCaP cells, a line of hormone responsive human prostate cancer cells. Our results demonstrate that hypoxia-reoxygenation resulted in increased survival, higher clonogenicity, and enhanced invasiveness of these cells. Moreover, hypoxia-reoxygenation was associated with an increased AR activity independent of androgens as well as increased Hypoxia Inducible Factor (HIF-1Î±) levels and activity. We also observed that the activation of p38 MAP kinase pathway was an early response to hypoxia, and inhibition of p38 MAP kinase pathway by variety of approaches abolished hypoxia-reoxygenation induced increased AR activity as well as increased survival, clonogenicity, and invasiveness. These results demonstrate a critical role for hypoxia induced p38 MAP kinase pathway in androgen independent AR activation in prostate cancer cells, and suggest that hypoxia re-oxygenation may select for aggressive androgen-independent prostate cancer phenotype.
