Rectal prolapse associated with traumatic fecal incontinence is a rare clinical combination. This study was designed to assess Delorme's operation with sphincteroplasty as a surgical management of this combination in terms of recurrence and improvement of fecal incontinence. In this prospective study, we enrolled patients suffering from short, full-thickness rectal prolapse associated with traumatic fecal incontinence who had been admitted to Alexandria Main University Hospital during the period of May 2010–January 2013. Preoperative data including cause of trauma, duration of symptoms, results of anal manometry, and degree of fecal incontinence using Wexner score were collected from all patients. Delorme's procedure with overlap sphincteroplasty was done in all patients. Recurrence of prolapse and improvement of fecal incontinence were assessed after 1, 3, 6 and 12 months. The study included 13 patients aged (32±8.7) years, 9 females and 4 males. Cause of sphincteric injury included previous anal surgery in 7 patients and normal labor in 6 patients. Duration between sphincteric injury and operation was (8.08±2.47) months. Preoperative Wexner's mean score was 16.07±3.4. Early postoperative complications included superficial wound infection (69.2%), minor wound dehiscence (61.5%), and postoperative bleeding (7.6%). Recurrence was detected in 1 patient at 6 month follow-up. Wexner's score showed significant improvement for all patients after 6 months (4.00±2.04). In conclusion, combination of Delorme's procedure and sphincteroplasty for treatment of patients with short complete rectal prolapse associated with traumatic fecal incontinence is a safe, effective surgical management with satisfactory results regarding anatomical and functional outcomes.
