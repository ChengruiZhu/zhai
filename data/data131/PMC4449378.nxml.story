The aim of this study was to determine the influence of cisplatin and novel dinuclear platinum(II) complexes on the membrane electrical properties and lipid peroxidation levels of the Molt-4 human leukemia cell line. Changes in cell function may affect the basal electrical surface properties of cell membranes. These changes can be detected using electrokinetic measurements. Surface charge densities of Molt-4 cells were measured as a function of pH. A four-component equilibrium model was used to describe the interaction between the ions in solution and on cell membrane surfaces. Agreement was found between the experimental and theoretical charge variation curves of the leukemia cells at pH 2.5–9. Lipid peroxidation was estimated by measuring levels of 8-iso-prostaglandine F2α [isoprostanes]. Acid and base functional group concentrations and average association constants with hydroxyl ions were smaller in cisplatin- or dinuclear platinum(II) complex-treated leukemia cell membranes compared to those in untreated cancer cells, and the average association constants with hydrogen ions were higher. Levels of lipid peroxidation products in cisplatin- or dinuclear platinum(II) complex-treated leukemia cell were higher than those found in untreated cancer cells.
