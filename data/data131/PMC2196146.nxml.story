In anti-red blood cell autoantibody transgenic (autoAb Tg) mice almost all B cells are deleted except for B-1 cells in the peritoneal cavity and the gut. About one-half of the auto Ab Tg mice suffer from autoimmune hemolytic anemia (AIHA) in the conventional condition. Oral administration of lipopolysaccharides activates B-1 cells and induces autoimmune symptoms in the Tg mice, suggesting that the autoimmune disease in anti-RBC autoAb Tg mice is triggered by infections. To examine the association of bacterial infections with the generation of B-1 cells and the occurrence of the autoimmune disease, we analyzed anti-RBC autoAb Tg mice bred in germ-free and specific pathogen-free conditions. In germ-free conditions, few peritoneal B-1 cells were detected, while a significant number of peritoneal B-1 cells existed in specific pathogen-free conditions. In both conditions, no mice suffered from AIHA. However, when these Tg mice were transferred to the conventional condition or injected with lipopolysaccharide, peritoneal B-1 cells expanded and some of these mice suffered from AIHA. These results clearly showed that bacterial infections are responsible for both the expansion of B-1 cells and the onset of the autoimmune disease in these Tg mice.
