The cohesin protein complex binds chromosomes to facilitate their proper division into two daughter cells when a cell divides. Cohesin and the Nipped-B protein that loads cohesin onto chromosomes also bind to genes and regions that regulate genes to ensure that genes produce proper amounts of RNA. Nipped-B and cohesin preferentially bind a subset of genes important for growth and development, and small changes in cohesin activity cause severe birth defects. Why cohesin binds some genes and not others is unknown. We tested the idea that proteins that specifically bind the RNA sequences being produced by genes may help determine which genes bind cohesin. We find that the Drosophila TBPH and Lark RNA-binding proteins bind RNA produced by genes that bind Nipped-B and cohesin. They also bind to these genes on chromosomes and the chromosomal regions that regulate them. TBPH ensures that Nipped-B and cohesin are present at high levels on regulatory regions and genes. Lark inhibits Nipped-B and cohesin binding to some genes and increases their binding to some regulatory regions. Nipped-B interacts with both RNA-binding proteins and promotes their binding to genes. These findings show that RNA-binding proteins help determine which genes bind Nipped-B and cohesin.
