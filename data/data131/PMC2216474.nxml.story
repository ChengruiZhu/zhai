We examined the development of K+ secretion after removing Cl- from the basolateral surface of isolated skins of Rana temporaria using noise analysis. K+ secretion was defined by the appearance of a Lorentzian component in the power density spectrum (PDS) when Ba2+ was present in the apical bath (0.5 mM). No Lorentzians were observed when tissues were bathed in control, NaCl Ringer solution. Replacement of basolateral Cl- by gluconate, nitrate, or SO4- (0-Clb) yielded Lorentzians with corner frequencies near 25 Hz, and plateau values (So) that were used to estimate the magnitude of K+ secretion through channels in the apical cell membranes of the principal cells. The response was reversible and reproducible. In contrast, removing apical Cl- did not alter the PDS. Reduction of basolateral Cl- to 11.5 mM induced Lorentzians, but with lower values of So. Inhibition of Na+ transport with amiloride or by omitting apical Na+ depressed K+ secretion but did not prevent its appearance in response to 0-Clb. Using microelectrodes, we observed depolarization of the intracellular voltage concomitant with increased resistance of the basolateral membrane after 0-Clb. Basolateral application of Ba2+ to depolarize cells also induced K+ secretion. Because apical conductance and channel density are unchanged after 0-Clb, we conclude that K+ secretion is "induced" simply by an increase of the electrical driving force for K+ exit across this membrane. Repolarization of the apical membrane after 0-Clb eliminated K+ secretion, while further depolarization increased the magnitude of the secretory current. The cell depolarization after 0- Clb is most likely caused directly by a decrease of the basolateral membrane K+ conductance. Ba2(+)-induced Lorentzians also were elicited by basolateral hypertonic solutions but with lower values of So, indicating that cell shrinkage per se could not entirely account for the response to 0-Clb and that the effects of 0-Clb may be partly related to a fall of intracellular Cl-.
