Parent-of-origin effects comprise a range of genetic and epigenetic mechanisms of inheritance. Recently, detection of such effects implicated epigenetic mechanisms in the etiology of multiple sclerosis (MS), a chronic inflammatory disease of the central nervous system. We here sought to dissect the magnitude and the type of parent-of-origin effects in the pathogenesis of experimental neuroinflammation under controlled environmental conditions. We investigated inheritance of an MS-like disease in rat, experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), using a backcross strategy designed to identify the parental origin of disease-predisposing alleles. A striking 37–54% of all detected disease-predisposing loci depended on parental transmission. Additionally, the Y chromosome from the susceptible strain contributed to disease susceptibility. Accounting for parent-of-origin enabled more powerful and precise identification of novel risk factors and increased the disease variance explained by the identified factors by 2-4-fold. The majority of loci displayed an imprinting–like pattern whereby a gene expressed only from the maternal or paternal copy exerts an effect. In particular, a locus on chromosome 6 comprises a well-known cluster of imprinted genes including the paternally expressed
