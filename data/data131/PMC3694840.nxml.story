Meiosis is a specialized cell division that underpins sexual reproduction. It begins with a diploid cell carrying both parental copies of each chromosome, and ends with four haploid cells, each containing only one copy. An essential feature of meiosis is meiotic recombination, during which the programmed generation of DNA double-strand-breaks (DSBs) is followed by the production of crossover(s) between two parental homologs, which facilitates their correct distribution to daughter nuclei. Failure to generate DSBs leads to errors in homolog disjunction, which produces inviable gametes. Although DSBs are essential for meiosis, each break represents a potentially lethal damage; as such, its formation must be tightly regulated. The evolutionarily conserved ATM/ATR family proteins were implicated in this control; nevertheless, the mechanism by which such control could be implemented remains elusive. Here we demonstrate that Tel1/Mec1 down-regulate meiotic DSB formation by phosphorylating Rec114, an essential component of the Spo11 complex. We also observed that Rec114 activity can be further down-regulated by its removal from chromosomes and subsequent degradation during later stages in meiosis. Evidence presented here provides an insight into the ways in which the number of meiotic DSBs might be maintained at developmentally programmed level.
