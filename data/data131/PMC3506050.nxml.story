The outcomes of a prospective consecutive study aimed at evaluating the visual and refractive benefit after cataract surgery with the implantation of the aspheric diffractive multifocal intraocular lens (IOL) Tecnis ZMB00 (Abbott Medical Optics) are reported. A total of 31 eyes of 19 patients (age range, 40 to 81 years) underwent phacoemulsification surgery with implantation of this aspheric multifocal IOL. At 6 months after surgery, postoperative spherical equivalent was within Â±1.00 D in 96.8% of eyes, with 94.7% of patients presenting a postoperative binocular far LogMAR uncorrected visual acuity (UCVA) of 0.1 or better. Far best-corrected distance VA improved significantly (p < 0.01), with postoperative values of 0.1 or better in 96.8% of eyes. Postoperative near UCVA was 0.10 (equivalent to J1) or better in 93.55% of eyes. Furthermore, the IOL power was found to be very poorly correlated with the postoperative far LogMAR (r = 0.13) and near UCVA (r = 0.13). In conclusion, the aspheric diffractive multifocal IOL Tecnis ZMB00 provides a restoration of the far and near visual function after phacoemulsification surgery for cataract removal or presbyopia correction, which is predictable and independent from the optical power of the implanted IOL.
