Sterile radiation reduction gloves have been widely used over the past several decades in an effort to reduce hand doses during fluoroscopically guided procedures. While multiple studies have quantified the potential dose reduction to the fluoroscope operator from the use of such gloves, possible effects on the patient have not yet been quantified. The aim of this study was to examine the impact on patient dose when radiation reduction gloves are used. The impact on patient dose when using radiation reduction gloves in the field of view (FOV) was evaluated by measuring patient entrance surface dose rates (ESDR) using three C‐arm fluoroscopes for a range of patient sizes and different operating and magnification modes. Multiple measuring fields were used in combination with both peripheral and central glove placement. ESDR were measured with no glove in the FOV, with one radiation reduction glove, and with double gloves in the FOV, to replicate the actions of some fluoroscope operators. Compared to an ungloved hand, the use of a single radiation reduction glove in the measuring field resulted in up to a 2.8‐fold increase in ESDR. The use of double radiation reduction gloves resulted in up to a 4.9‐fold increase in ESDR. In both cases, the increase in ESDR was dependent on the size of the patient and on the operating and magnification modes used, and ranged from no increase up to the aforementioned maximum. When used in the FOV, and particularly within the measuring field, radiation reduction gloves can substantially increase ESDR. This increase in dose, when considered against the relatively small published reduction in dose to the operator's hands, may mean that the increased risks from the use of radiation reduction gloves outweigh the benefits. In any case, hands should not be placed in the FOV if not required by the goals of the procedure.
