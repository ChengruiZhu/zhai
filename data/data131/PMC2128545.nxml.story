 1. The intradermal method of inoculating Virus III, a hitherto unknown filterable virus producing lesions in rabbits, gives more reliable results than those obtained by smearing the virus on the scarified skin. 2. Virus III, heated 10 minutes at 55Â°C., will not produce visible reactions in the skin of rabbits. 3. Virus III passes through Berkefeld N and V filters. 4. The data obtained so far indicate that the best method of preserving Virus III in an active state is to filter the testicular emulsions containing the virus, add glycerol to the filtrate up to 40 per cent of the total volume, seal with vaseline, and store on ice. 5. Viable Virus III produces a definite immunity in rabbits which persists for at least 6 months. The immunity follows intradermal, intratesticular, intravenous, intracerebral, or intranasal inoculations of the virus. 6. A single intradermal injection of Virus III, which has been killed by heat, will not produce a demonstrable immunity in rabbits. 7. No passive immunity to Virus III could be demonstrated in rabbits which had received intravenous injections of 5 to 10 cc. of immune rabbit serum 24 hours previously. 8. Immune rabbit serum neutralizes Virus III either
