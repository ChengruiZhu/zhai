The purpose of this study was to prepare, optimize, and characterize a cationic lipid nanoparticle (CLN) system containing multicomponent drugs using a molecular dynamics model as a novel method of evaluating formulations. Puerarin (PUE) and scutellarin (SCU) were used as model drugs. CLNs were successfully prepared using melt-emulsion ultrasonication and low temperature-solidification technique. The properties of CLNs such as morphology, particle size, zeta potential, entrapment efficiency (EE), drug loading (DL), and drug release behavior were investigated. The CLNs were evaluated by corneal permeation, preocular retention time, and pharmacokinetics in the aqueous humor. Additionally, a molecular dynamics model was used to evaluate the formulation. Electron microscopy results showed that the nanoparticles were approximately spherical in shape. The EE (%) and DL (%) values of PUE and SCU in the optimal formulation were 56.60±3.73, 72.31±1.96 and 1.68±0.17, 2.44±1.14, respectively. The pharmacokinetic study in the aqueous humor showed that compared with the PUE and SCU solution, the area under the concentration–time curve (AUC) value of PUE was enhanced by 2.33-fold for PUE-SCU CLNs (
