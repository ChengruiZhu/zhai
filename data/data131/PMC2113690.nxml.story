Monoclonal antibodies were prepared to identify molecular components specific to the mitotic apparatus of sea urchin eggs. The mitotic apparatus or asters induced within unfertilized eggs by taxol treatment were isolated from Strongylocentrotus purpuratus and used for immunization of mice. After fusion with spleen cells, the supernatant of hybridomas were screened in two stages by indirect immunofluorescence staining, first on isolated sea urchin mitotic spindles in 96-well microtiter plates to identify rapidly potential positive hybridomas, and second, on whole mitotic eggs on coverslips to distinguish between spindle-specific staining and adventitious contamination. Two hybridomas, SU4 and SU5, secreted antibodies reactive to microtubule-containing structures in eggs during the course of development. They preferentially stained the centrosphere both in isolated mitotic apparatus and in whole metaphase eggs, which was further confirmed by staining the isolated centrospheres with these antibodies. SU4 recognized a major 190-kD polypeptide on immunoblots as well as a species at 180 and 20 kD, whereas hybridoma SU5 stained a species at 50 kD. Thus, these polypeptides may be components of the centrosphere.
