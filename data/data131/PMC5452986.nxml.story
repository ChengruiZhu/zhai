A 35-year-old male was diagnosed with chronic myeloid leukemia in the chronic phase and was prescribed 100 mg daily dasatinib. However, dasatinib was discontinued due to thrombocytopenia, and within six months, the disease progressed to the lymphoid blastic phase. Hyper-cyclophosphamide, vincristine, adriamycin and dexamethasone chemotherapy combined with 140 mg dasatinib or 600 mg imatinib was prescribed. The two inhibitors were soon discontinued due to severe thrombocytopenia and jaundice, respectively. Myelosuppression persisted subsequent to the nadir. Bone marrow (BM) aspiration and biopsy revealed hypercellular marrow filled with blasts. Sequencing of the leukemia cells revealed overlapping peaks for the wild-type sequence and the T315I mutant sequence. The patient was treated with 500 mg bosutinib (which was later reduced to 300 mg) for pretransplant cytoreduction. After 5 months, the patient's spleen exhibited a reduction in volume and the percentage of blasts in the BM decreased from 96.1 to 17.5%. The patient successfully underwent cord blood transplantation. The patient has been disease-free for 5 months subsequent to transplantation. This case suggests that bosutinib may be effective for cytoreduction prior to stem cell transplantation, unless the leukemia cells consistently harbor the T315I mutation.
