The first 4.5 days of mammalian embryo development proceeds without maternal information and is remarkably robust to perturbations. For example, if an early embryo is cut in half, it produces 2 perfectly patterned, smaller embryos. Where does the information guiding this development come from? Here, we explore this issue and ask whether a model composed of a simple set of rules governing cell behavior and cell—cell interactions produces in silico embryos. This agent-based computational model demonstrates that 4 rules, in which a cell makes decisions based on its neighbors to adopt polarity, make lineage choices, alter its adhesion, or die, can recapitulate blastocyst development in silico. By manipulating these rules, we could also recapitulate specific phenotypes at similar frequencies to those observed in vivo. One interesting prediction of our model is that the duration of cell—cell communication through fibroblast growth factor (FGF) signaling controls scaling of a region of the blastocyst, and we confirmed this experimentally. Taken together, our model specifies a set of rules that provide a framework for self-organization, and it is this self-organizing embryogenesis that may be an enabler of stochastic variation in evolution.
