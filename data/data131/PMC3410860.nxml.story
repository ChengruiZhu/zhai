Flies and worms have long served as valuable model organisms for the study of human development and health. Despite the great morphological and evolutionary distance between them, humans, flies, and worms share many commonalities. Each develops from three major germ layers and is patterned along the two major spatial axes. At the molecular level, development in these widely diverged species is often controlled by the same signaling pathways activating members of the same transcription factor and target gene families, shared since the common ancestor of humans, flies, and worms. And yet, at the gene regulatory level, humans and flies or worms seem starkly different, with not a single regulatory region shared across the phyla. Here we discover the first two examples of developmental enhancers conserved between deuterostomes (ranging from human to sea urchins) and protostomes (a large clade that includes flies and worms). We show evidence that these ancient regulatory loci retain the capacity to respond to the same signaling pathways in these widely diverged organisms, and we show that they have been co-opted, along with the molecular pathways that control them, to pattern the vertebrate nervous systems. Our screen supports large scale regulatory rewiring, while offering the first intriguing outliers.
