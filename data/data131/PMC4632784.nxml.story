 mice models, an obvious increase of miR-223 was observed in aortic atherosclerotic lesions. In lipopolysaccharide (LPS) activated macrophages, its expression was decreased. The miR-223 overexpression significantly attenuated macrophage foam cell formation, lipid accumulation and pro-inflammatory cytokine production, which were reversed by anti-miR-223 inhibitor transfection. Mechanism assay corroborated that miR-223 negatively regulated the activation of the toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4)-nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) pathway. Pretreatment with a specific inhibitor of NF-κB (pyrrolidinedithiocarbamate, PDTC) strikingly abrogated miR-223 silence-induced lipid deposition and inflammatory cytokine production. Furthermore, PI3K/AKT was activated by miR-223 up-regulation. Pretreatment with PI3K/AKT inhibitor LY294002 strikingly ameliorated the inhibitory effects of miR-223 on the activation of TLR4 and p65, concomitant with the increase in lipid deposition and inflammatory cytokine production. Together, these data indicate that miR-223 up-regulation might abrogate the development of atherosclerosis by blocking TLR4 signaling through activation of the PI3K/AKT pathway, and provides a promising therapeutic avenue for the treatment of atherosclerosis.
