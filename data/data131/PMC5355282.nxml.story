RNA editing results in post-transcriptional modification and could potentially contribute to carcinogenesis. However, RNA editing in advanced lung adenocarcinomas has not yet been studied. Based on whole genome and transcriptome sequencing data, we identified 1,071,296 RNA editing events from matched normal, primary and metastatic samples contributed by 24 lung adenocarcinoma patients, with 91.3% A-to-G editing on average, and found significantly more RNA editing sites in tumors than in normal samples. To investigate cancer relevant editing events, we detected 67,851 hyper-editing sites in primary and 50,480 hyper-editing sites in metastatic samples. 46 genes with hyper-editing in coding regions were found to result in amino acid alterations, while hundreds of hyper-editing events in non-coding regions could modulate splicing or gene expression, including genes related to tumor stage or clinic prognosis. Comparing RNA editome of primary and metastatic samples, we also discovered hyper-edited genes that may promote metastasis development. These findings showed a landscape of RNA editing in matched normal, primary and metastatic tissues of lung adenocarcinomas for the first time and provided new insights to understand the molecular characterization of this disease.
