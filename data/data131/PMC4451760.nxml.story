A central problem in systems neuroscience is to understand how the activity of neural populations is mapped onto behavior. Neural responses in sensory areas vary substantially upon repeated presentations of the same stimulus, and this limits the reliability with which two similar stimuli can be discriminated by any read-out of neural activity. Fisher information provides a quantitative measure of the reliability of the sensory representation, and it has been used extensively to analyze neural data. Traditional methods for quantifying Fisher information rely on decoding neural activity; however, optimizing a decoder requires larger amounts of data than available in typical experiments, and as a result decoding-based estimators systematically underestimate information. Here we introduce a novel estimator that can accurately determine information with far less data, and that runs orders of magnitude faster. The estimator is based on analytical calculation, and corrects the bias that arises when estimating information directly from limited data. The analytical guarantee of an unbiased estimator and its computational simplicity will allow experimentalists to compare coding reliability across behavioral conditions and monitor it over time.
