The aim of the present study was to determine whether immediate revision surgery has benefits for patients with iatrogenic bilateral recurrent laryngeal nerve (RLN) palsy. From January 1, 2004 to January 30, 2011, 29 consecutive patients underwent immediate revision after total thyroidectomy. The cohort comprised 29 patients, 2 males and 27 females, aged 23 to 76 years (median 52 years). Identification of the type and extent of injury of each branch was reported in the protocol, and reconstruction was performed whenever possible. A complete transection of the nerve or one of its branches was found in 14 and 5 nerves, respectively. In three patients, the nerve was completely or partially transected on both sides. Seven anatomically intact nerves were injured by loaded ligature, in one case there was a sign of thermal damage and four nerves showed signs of excessive manipulation (thinning of the nerve trunk). Primary end-to-end anastomosis was performed in seven completely transected RLN and four transected anterior branches of RLN. None of the reconstructed nerve trunks or its branches regained function, although good muscle tone was observed. 23 of 38 intact nerves (61%) regained function, and normal vocalcord mobility on both sides was restored in only four patients. In all cases with regained vocal-cord mobility, functional recovery occurred within 3 months after primary surgery. In conclusion, immediate revision after thyroidectomy may help to indicate the type of RLN damage, which is a predictor of functional recovery and one of major factors influencing future therapeutic management.
