 in 1993 and the increasing realization that small RNAs are at the heart of many biological processes have led to a revolution in our thinking about development and disease. In animals, several hundred microRNAs (miRNAs) have been identified that regulate diverse biological processes ranging from cell metabolism to cell differentiation and growth, apoptosis, and cancer. Moreover, it has been shown that many miRNAs are characterized by highly specific spatial and temporal expression patterns supporting their role in such processes. However, the dynamics of small RNA patterns in male and female embryonic stem (ES) cells in the course of early differentiation has not been investigated so far. Our work represents the first study of this kind. Notably, we have identified new classes of miRNAs that show extremely defined temporal profiles during ES cell differentiation, as well as sex-specificity. Our results are of broad interest and importance because they raise the power of ES cells in defining the repertoire of small RNAs and their dynamics in mammals, and underline the importance of integrating miRNA expression patterns into the transcription factor networks and epigenomic maps defined in ES cells in order to provide a better understanding of the control of pluripotency and lineage commitment.
