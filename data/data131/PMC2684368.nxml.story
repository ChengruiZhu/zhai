Ureteric stricture is a feared manifestation of genitourinary tuberculosis (TB) with the commonest site being the lower ureter. The purpose of this review is to discuss the management options for this condition. Literature search was done using PubMed and all articles on TB and ureteric stricture were reviewed published between 1990 till September 2007. The exact site and length of stricture must be defined with radioimaging (intravenous urography, retrograde, or antegrade pyelography) and renal function be quantified. The treatment of stricture mostly requires some kind of intervention after a brief period of antituberculous medicines with or without steroids. For uncomplicated/simple strictures (short segment, passable, with renal function >25%, good bladder capacity) endourologic option should be used which usually means double-J stenting with or without balloon dilatation. For complicated/complex strictures (long segment, dense fibrosis, with renal function <20%, small bladder capacity) regular surgical options should be considered which usually means ureteroureterostomy or ureteropyelostomy for upper ureteric strictures, intubated ureterostomy, or transureteroureterostomy for midureteric strictures, psoas hitch/Boari flap for lower ureteric strictures or ileal ureter/autotransplantation for whole length/multiple strictures.
