Aging and chronic inflammation produce complex changes to the structure of the lung including accumulation of cells and debris, thinning and destruction of air sacs, altered airway size and increased tendency for airway collapse. As these structural changes are observed concurrently, their individual contributions to altered lung function cannot readily be determined by conventional measurement of lung function. Our study employs a novel approach to identifying the age progression of these effects in mice with and without chronic lung inflammation. Histologic changes in lung tissue were incorporated into a computational model of the mouse lung and used to simulate measured changes in lung function. By incorporating experimentally measured factors into the model in a stepwise fashion, the contribution of destructive and remodeling processes to alterations in lung function can be assessed. This modeling approach provides a framework for determining the significance of structural changes to the altered function observed in complex lung pathologies such as emphysema and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Such an approach could be utilized to assess mechanisms by which compounds alter lung function and the capacity of specific therapies to produce improvements in lung function at the organ level.
