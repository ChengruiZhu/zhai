) encapsulated within fatty acid vesicles using 2′-amino-2′,3′-dideoxyguanosine−5′-phosphorimidazolide as the activated monomer. However, to realize a true Darwinian system, the template-copying chemistry must be able to copy most sequences and their complements to allow for the transmission of information from generation to generation. Here, we describe the copying of a series of nucleic acid templates using 2′-amino-2′,3′-dideoxynucleotide−5′-phosphorimidazolides. Polymerization reactions proceed rapidly to completion on short homopolymer RNA and LNA templates, which favor an A-type duplex geometry. We show that more efficiently copied sequences are generated by replacing the adenine nucleobase with diaminopurine, and uracil with C5-(1-propynyl)uracil. Finally, we explore the copying of longer, mixed-sequence RNA templates to assess the sequence-general copying ability of 2′-amino-2′,3′-dideoxynucleoside−5′-phosphorimidazolides. Our results are a significant step forward in the realization of a self-replicating genetic polymer compatible with protocell template copying and suggest that N2′→P5′-phosphoramidate DNA may have the potential to function as a self-replicating system.
