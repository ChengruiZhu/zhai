The interaction between the hepatitis C virus (HCV) envelope protein E2 and the host cell surface receptor CD81 is critical for HCV entry into hepatocytes and presents a promising drug and vaccine target. Yet, the number of E2-CD81 complexes that must be formed between a virus and a target cell to enable viral entry remains unknown. Direct observation of the E2-CD81 complexes preceding viral entry has not been possible. We constructed a mathematical model of HCV viral kinetics in vitro and using it to analyze data from recent cell culture studies obtained estimates of the threshold number of E2-CD81 complexes necessary for HCV entry. We found that depending on the E2-CD81 binding affinity, between 1 and 13 complexes are necessary for HCV entry into human hepatoma-derived cells. Our study thus presents new, quantitative insights into the molecular requirements of HCV entry, which may serve as a guideline for intervention strategies targeting the E2-CD81 interaction. Further, our study shows that HCV viral kinetics in vitro can be described using a mathematical model, thus facilitating quantitative analyses of the wealth of data now emanating from cell culture studies of HCV infection.
