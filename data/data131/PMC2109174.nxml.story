 Fusing human HeLa metaphase cells with HeLa interphase cells resulted within 30 min in either of two phenomena in the resultant binucleate cell: either prophasing of the interphase nucleus or formation of a normal-appearing nuclear envelope around the metaphase chromosomes. The frequency of either occurrence was strongly dependent on environmental pH. At pH's of 6.6â€“8.0, prophasing predominated; at pH 8.5 nuclear envelope formation predominated. Additionally, the frequencies of the two events in multinucleate cells depended on the metaphase/interphase ratio. When the ratio was 0.33 nuclear envelope formation predominated; when it was 2.0 prophasing predominated. In their general features, the results with fused HeLa cells resembled those reported earlier with fused Chinese hamster Don cells. However, the results provided an indication that between pH 6.6 and 8.0 the HeLa metaphase cells possessed a much greater capacity than the Don metaphase cells to induce prophasing. Fusion of Don metaphase cells with HeLa interphase cells or of Don interphase cells with HeLa metaphase cells at pH 8.0 resulted in nuclear envelope formation or prophasing in each kind of heterokaryon. As in the homokaryons, the frequencies of the two events in the heterokaryons depended on the metaphase/interphase ratio. The statistics of prophasing and nuclear envelope formation in the homo- and heterokaryon populations were consistent with the notion that disruption or formation of the nuclear envelope depends on the balance attained between disruptive and formative processes.
