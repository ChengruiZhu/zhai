Allosteric protein regulation is the mechanism by which binding of a molecule to one site in a protein affects the activity at another site. Although the two classical phenomenological models, Monod-Wyman-Changeux (MWC) and Koshland-Némethy-Filmer (KNF), span from the case of hemoglobin to membrane receptors, they do not describe the intramolecular interactions involved. The coupling between two allosterically connected sites commonly takes place through coherent collective motion involving the whole protein. We therefore introduce a quantity called binding leverage to measure the strength of the coupling between particular binding sites and such motions. We show that high binding leverage is a characteristic of both allosteric sites and catalytic sites, emphasizing that both enzymatic function and allosteric regulation require a coupling between ligand binding and protein dynamics. We also consider the first known case of purely entropic allostery, where ligand binding only affects the amplitudes of fluctuations. We find that the binding site in this protein does not primarily connect to collective motions – instead the modulation of fluctuations is controlled from a deeply buried and highly connected site. Finally, sites with high binding leverage but no known biological function could be latent allosteric sites, and thus drug targets.
