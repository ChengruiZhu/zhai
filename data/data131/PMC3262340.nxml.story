 H. TachoComb is made with equine collagen, bovine thrombin, bovine aprotinin, and human fibrinogen. The clinical efficacy of TachoSil was shown firstly by a clinical study of hepatic surgery. In the study, TachoSil proved to be superior to argon beamer in obtaining effective and fast intraoperative hemostasis. Following the study, many applications in different fields of surgery have been reported in the literature. The use of TachoSil in open abdominal surgery and its relevant results have encouraged the use of TachoSil in laparoscopic surgery. Unfortunately, its use in laparoscopy has not become as popular as it is in open surgery, due to a lack of efficacious techniques. Immunologic reactions to compounds of TachoSil and the transmission of infectious diseases are two major risks concerning topical hemostasis. Even though the risk of severe immunologic reactions to bovine material is low, TachoSil has gradually replaced all bovine material with material of human origin and has therefore eliminated the associated risks of bovine material. TachoSil has a good satisfaction rate among surgeons and reduces both the operating time for patients and the time spent in intensive care units.
