OBJECTIVES: To present sales figures of antifungal drugs for treatment of genital Candida infections in females, which had been purchased in the Swedish county of Sk√•ne (with approximately 1.2 million inhabitants) during the 1990s. To study the relative proportions of the drugs sold by prescription and as over-the-counter (OTC) products. METHODS: Sales figures of antifungal drugs for therapy of vulvovaginal candidiasis (VVC) and such recurrent infections (RVVC), for the years 1990--99, were collected from the 'ACS' database of the National Corporation of Swedish Pharmacies. RESULTS: The study showed an increase in sales of the type of drugs studied from 45,000 packages in 1990 until mid-93/94, when approximately 70,000 packages were sold (mainly azoles for topical use and fluconazole for oral intake). Thereafter there was a decrease until the end of November 1999, when 54,000 packages were purchased. Of the total sales, 93% were OTC products. Sales of clotrimazole and econazole (for vaginal installation) in 1993--1994 were equal to 85-90 packages/1000 women in the age group 15-45 years. Extremely high sales volumes of fluconazole and itraconazole, for one single year each, could be explained by marketing-related activities directed to the medical community. CONCLUSIONS: As many women with RVVC are not cured by iatrogenic initiatives and women consider themselves able to diagnose episodes of genital Candida infection, affected women generally turn to self-medication with antifungal OTC products. This stresses the role of pharmacy counseling. Short-term marked alterations in sales volumes may be due to marketing factors rather than changes in the epidemiology of genital Candida infections.
