The freeze–thaw technique was used to induce myocardial necrosis in freshly excised mouse hearts. Supernatants from NMCs contained multiple DAMPs, including high mobility group box-1 (HMGB1), galectin-3, S100β, S100A8, S100A9, and interleukin-1α. NMCs provoked a significant increase in fibroblast proliferation, α–smooth muscle actin activation, and collagen 1A1 and 3A1 mRNA expression and significantly increased fibroblast motility in a cell-wounding assay in a Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4)- and receptor for advanced glycation end products–dependent manner. NMC stimulation resulted in a significant 3- to 4-fold activation of Akt and Erk, whereas pretreatment with Akt (A6730) and Erk (U0126) inhibitors decreased NMC-induced fibroblast proliferation dose-dependently. The effects of NMCs on cell proliferation and collagen gene expression were mimicked by several recombinant DAMPs, including HMGB1 and galectin-3. Moreover, immunodepletion of HMGB1 in NMC supernatants abrogated NMC-induced cell proliferation. Finally, injection of NMC supernatants or recombinant HMGB1 into the heart provoked increased myocardial inflammation and fibrosis in wild-type mice but not in TLR4-deficient mice.
