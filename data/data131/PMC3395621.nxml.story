Plants are studied for their ability to adapt to their environment and especially to the physical constraints to which they are subjected. It is expected that they evolve in promoting genetic variants favorable under their native conditions, which could lead to negative consequences in other conditions. One approach to study the mechanisms and dynamics of these adaptations is to discover genetic variants that control potentially adaptive traits, and to study directly these variants in wild populations to try to reveal their evolutionary trajectory. We have identified a new polymorphism in a gene coding for a transporter of molybdenum (an essential micronutrient for the plant) in Arabidopsis; we show that this variant has strong phenotypic consequences at the level of plant growth and reproductive value in specific conditions, and that it explains a lot of the species diversity for these traits. Especially, the variant is associated with a clear negative effect under molybdenum-deficient conditions (caused by soil acidity) and with a subtle positive effect under molybdenum-plethoric conditions. Interestingly, the landscape distribution of the variant is not random among Asian populations and correlates well with the availability of molybdenum in the soil at the precise location where the plants are growing in the wild.
