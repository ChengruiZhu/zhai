Nanobiology is challenging to computational biology. The aim is to predict candidate nanostructures consisting of biopolymers. The idea the authors have followed for some years is to employ naturally occurring protein building blocks for protein and nanostructure design. Drawing on proteins as material is attractive, since proteins and their building blocks have a large repertoire of shapes and surface chemistry. The authors assume that the shape is given: either a target protein scaffold or a functional nanoparticle shape. Ideally, building blocks should self-assemble spontaneously. In practice, self-assembly involves time scales not affordable for computations. Instead, here is presented the first step in knowledge-based nanotube design: creating a nanotube with specified protein arrangement and tube geometry. Models are constructed by wrapping a planar sheet onto a cylinder surface. The sheet is shaped by a repeating 2-D lattice. This simplification reduces the complexity to the protein arrangement in the lattice and does not prevent construction of all possible nanotubes of repeated units. It allows optimization with all-atom force field. This is important since local energy minimization may screen whether a specified nanotube is a feasible nanostructure.
