The present study was carried out to determine whether the mechanically activated cation channel Piezo1 protein plays a role as a signaling pathway which causes the apoptosis of human chondrocytes. The chondrocytes were isolated, cultured, and then subjected to mechanical stretch force for 0, 2, 12, 24 and 48 h, respectively. The expression levels of Piezo1 and the apoptosis-related protein caspase-12 were assessed by reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction, as well as the apoptosis-related genes, B cell lymphoma/leukemia-2 (Bcl-2), Bcl-associated X protein (Bax) and Bcl-2-associated death promoter (BAD). Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) activity was used to discern dead cells. Piezo1 expression was determined by immunofluorescence. In addition, Piezo1 inhibitor, GsMTx4, was used to block the mechanically activated (MA) cation channel Piezo1, and served as a positive control. The results showed that the osteoarthritis (OA)-derived chondrocytes showed a tendency to undergo late-stage apoptosis under compressive loading. Piezo1 and caspase-12 were significantly upregulated under static compressive stimuli and the expression was related to the rate of apoptosis of the OA-derived chondrocytes during compressive loading. The expression of caspase-12 and late-stage apoptosis of the human OA-derived chondrocytes were repressed by GsMTx4, the specific inhibitor of Piezo1, while the expression of Piezo1 and the induction of the apoptosis of the OA-derived chondrocytes during compressive loading was not totally blocked. Thus, we conclude that Piezo1 plays an important role in the apoptosis of human OA-derived chondrocytes through a caspase-12-dependent pathway. The expression of Piezo1 protein was not totally inhibited by GsMTx4.
