Thoracic endovascular repair (TEVAR) is an effective treatment for type B aortic dissection (TBAD). Here, we evaluated the early-midterm effectiveness and safety of TEVAR for treating TBAD patients after renal transplantation. Six patients with TBAD treated with TEVAR after renal transplantation were recruited between February 2012 and December 2016. They were then followed up with clinical examinations and computed tomography angiography (CTA). TEVAR was successfully performed in all patients (100%), and the primary tear sites were well covered by stents with or without coverage of the left subclavian artery. No severe complications occurred in any patient during perioperative period. The one-year survival rate was 100%, one patient died of renal graft failure and heart failure four years after TEVAR; the remaining five patients (83.3%) survived and exhibited no severe complications. Our findings show that TEVAR provides satisfactory short-midterm results for TBAD patients after renal transplantation. Moreover, our experience shows that it need relative longer proximal landing zone to prevent the endoleak and recurrence. However, regular hematodialysis, long-term immunosuppressive therapy, and blood pressure control remain crucial factors to prolong survival. Long-term follow-up studies are needed to evaluate the long-term prognosis in these patients.
