Viruses are responsible for devastating illnesses in humans and cause significant commercial losses in livestock and crops. Their genetic material is transported into their host organisms via protein containers, called viral capsids, that act as Trojan horses: they release their cargo into the cells of their hosts, hijacking their molecular machinery for the production of progeny viruses. Imaging techniques exploiting the symmetric structures of viral capsids have been used to determine details of their organization to atomic resolution, opening up the possibility to design anti-viral agents against specific surface structures. In many viruses the genomes take on specific organizations as a consequence of their roles in capsid formation. In order to design an additional class of anti-viral drugs that interfere with this process, it is important to understand the asymmetric organization of the genome inside viral capsids. This is currently a challenge, as the averaging techniques used to achieve high resolution structures of the protein containers cannot be used. We present a new approach and demonstrate its predictive power here for a test virus. This paves the way for a better understanding of the functional roles of viral RNAs in virus assembly and their exploitation in anti-viral drug design.
