Lung adenocarcinoma is one of the leading causes of cancer-related death worldwide. We showed transcriptomic profiles in three pairs of tumors and adjacent non-tumor lung tissues using next-generation sequencing (NGS) to screen protein-coding RNAs and microRNAs. Combined with meta-analysis from the Oncomine and Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) databases, we identified a representative genetic expression signature in lung adenocarcinoma. There were 9 upregulated genes, and 8 downregulated genes in lung adenocarcinoma. The analysis of the effects from each gene expression on survival outcome indicated that 6 genes (AGR2, SPDEF, CDKN2A, CLDN3, SFN, and PHLDA2) play oncogenic roles, and 7 genes (PDK4, FMO2, CPED1, GNG11, IL33, BTNL9, and FABP4) act as tumor suppressors in lung adenocarcinoma. In addition, we also identified putative genetic interactions, in which there were 5 upregulated microRNAs with specific targets - hsa-miR-183-5p-BTNL9, hsa-miR-33b-5p-CPED1, hsa-miR-429-CPED1, hsa-miR-182-5p-FMO2, and hsa-miR-130b-5p-IL33. These 5 microRNAs have been shown to be associated with tumorigenesis in lung cancer. Our findings suggest that these genetic interactions play important roles in the progression of lung adenocarcinoma. We propose that this molecular change of genetic expression may represent a novel signature in lung adenocarcinoma, which may be developed for diagnostic and therapeutic strategies in the future.
