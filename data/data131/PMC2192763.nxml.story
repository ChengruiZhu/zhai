A human receptor that is selective for the CXC chemokines IP10 and Mig was cloned and characterized. The receptor cDNA has an open reading frame of 1104-bp encoding a protein of 368 amino acids with a molecular mass of 40,659 dalton. The sequence includes seven putative transmembrane segments characteristic of G-protein coupled receptors. It shares 40.9 and 40.3% identical amino acids with the two IL-8 receptors, and 34.2-36.9% identity with the five known CC chemokine receptors. The IP10/Mig receptor is highly expressed in IL-2-activated T lymphocytes, but is not detectable in resting T lymphocytes. B lymphocytes, monocytes and granulocytes. It mediates Ca2+ mobilization and chemotaxis in response to IP10 and Mig, but does not recognize the CXC-chemokines IL-8, GRO alpha, NAP-2, GCP-2. ENA78, PF4, the CC- chemokines MCP-1, MCP-2, MCP-3, MCP-4, MIP-1 alpha, MIP-1 beta. RANTES, 1309, eotaxin, nor lymphotactin. The exclusive expression in activated T-lymphocytes is of high interest since the receptors for chemokines which have been shown so far to attract lymphocytes, e.g., MCP-1, MCP- 2, MCP-3, MIP-1 alpha, MIP-1 beta, and RANTES, are also found in monocytes and granulocytes. The present observations suggest that the IP10/Mig receptor is involved in the selective recruitment of effector T cells.
