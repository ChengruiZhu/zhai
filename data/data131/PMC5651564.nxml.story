T cells recognize antigen fragments from proteolytic products that are presented to them in the form of peptides on major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules, which is crucial for the T cell to identify infected or transformed cells. Autophagy, a process that delivers cytoplasmic constituents for lysosomal degradation, has been observed to provide a substantial source of intra- and extracellular antigens for MHC presentation to T cells, which will impact the tumor-specific immune response. Meanwhile, extracellular components are transported to cytoplasm for the degradation/secretion process by the endo-/exosomal pathway and are thus involved in multiple physiological and pathological processes, including immune responses. Autophagy and endo-/exosomal pathways are intertwined in a highly intricate manner and both are closely involved in antigen processing for MHC presentation; thus, we propose that they may coordinate in antigen processing and presentation in anticancer T cell immune responses. In this article, we discuss the molecular and functional crosstalk between autophagy and endo-/exosomal pathways and their contributions to antigen processing for MHC presentation in anticancer T cell immune responses.
