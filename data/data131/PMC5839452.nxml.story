For the first time in the world medical literature, we describe a rare form of cutaneous dermatophytosis – a bullous form of Tinea incognito, classified by clinical picture, histopathological findings and an isolated infectious agent from the microbiological culture. After a thorough review of Medline/PubMed’s relevant literature, we could not find similar cases of patients with Tinea incognito who are clinically presented with bullous lesions at the same time. Local application of corticosteroids in infants with unknown lesions may lead to progression of the underlying disease and may cause some serious problems in differential diagnosis aspect, while the clinical expression remains completely masked. Exactly for this reason, right at the beginning of the clinical complaints, a skin biopsy should be obligatorily performed in parallel with microbiological swabs. If there is no improvement after the local corticosteroid application, then diagnosis revision and change of the strategy of clinical behaviour would be appropriate to be done. The systemic treatment that we performed with Fluconazole 50 mg in combination with the local antimycotic agent for a 2-week period led to complete remission.
