Point of care testing, is the term commonly applied to the bedside tests performed in sick patients. Common clinical conditions encountered in pediatric emergency rooms are respiratory, gastro-intestinal, infections and cardiac. Emergencies at most of the places, especially developing countries are overburdened. Availability of tests like arterial blood gas, lactate, electrolytes and procalcitonin, bedside tests or point of care tests can help identify sick patients quickly. Abnormalities like acid-base disturbances and dyselectrolytemias can be dealt with instantly, thus improving the overall prognosis. Lactate levels in emergency give the earliest clue to cardiovascular compromise and poor tissue perfusion. Procalcitonin has recently gained significant importance as an acute phase reactant for early identification of sepsis. Decisions for initiating or withholding antibiotic therapy can also be taken based on procalcitonin levels in emergency. Bedside estimation of serum electrolytes, blood gas analysis and procalcitonin thus facilitate the clinical evaluation and management of critical patients. An extensive literature review of current status of these investigations as point of care tests is appraised here.
