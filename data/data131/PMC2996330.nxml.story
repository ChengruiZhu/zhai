Recently many genetic variants have been established for diseases, and the findings have raised hope for risk prediction based on genomic profiles. However, we need to have proper statistical measures to assess the usefulness of such tests. In this study, we developed a statistical framework which enables us to evaluate many predictive indices analytically. It is based on the liability threshold model, which postulates a latent liability that is normally distributed. Affected individuals are assumed to have a liability exceeding a certain threshold. We demonstrated that, given the overall disease probability and variance in liability explained by the genetic markers, we can compute a variety of predictive indices. An example is the area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve, or AUC, which is very commonly employed. However, the limitations of AUC are often ignored, and we proposed complementing it with other indices. We have therefore also computed other metrics like the average difference in risks between cases and non-cases, the ability of reclassification into high- and low-risk categories, and the proportion of cases accounted for by a certain percentile of population at the highest risk. We also derived how to construct graphs showing the risk distribution in population.
