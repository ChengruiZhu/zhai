There were 951 primary hip arthroscopies and 75 revision hip arthroscopies. Arthroscopy was performed for FAI in 936 hips (91.2%), and 760 hips (74.1%) had a labral repair and 229 hips (22.3%) had a labral debridement. The most common event (18.7% of hips) noted was post-operative sensory disturbance adjacent to the portals or involving the distal anterolateral thigh consistent with LFC nerve disturbance. This was typically not noticed by patients and found on physical examination and only persisted beyond 6 months in 7 hips (0.7%). Iatrogenic chondral injury was noted for 20 hips (1.9%), iatrogenic labral puncture in 11 hips (1.1%), superficial portal infection in 6 hips (0.6%), sensory deficit about the foot in 9 hips (0.9%), deep venous thrombosis in 3 hips (0.3%), pulminary embolism in 1 hip (0.1%), pulmonary edema in 1 hip (0.1%), wound hematoma in 2 hips (0.2%), perineal numbness (pudendal nerve) in 9 hips (0.9%), heterotopic ossification in 4 hips (0.4%), reflex sympathetic dystrophy in 1 hip (0.1%) and wound/skin (traction) dehiscence in 1 hips (0.1%). There were no femoral neck fractures, iatrogenic instability, AVN, or extra-abdominal fluid extravasation in this cohort. The overall complication rate not including temporary periportal and thigh numbness (sequalae) was 6.9% (71 hips). Overall 88.7% had a grade 1, 5.6% Grade 2, 4.2% grade 3, and 1.4% grade 4 complication. There was no difference in the rate of complications between males and females (p=.221), primary vs revision cases (p=.159) or labral repair vs debridement (p=.173), and BMI had no effect on complication rate.
