The aim of the present study was to investigate the effects of the novel polyamine analog tetrabutyl propanediamine (TBP) on the growth of K562 chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) cells and the underlying mechanism of these effects. MTT was used for the analysis of cell proliferation and flow cytometry was performed to analyze cell cycle distribution. DNA fragmentation analysis and Annexin V/propidium iodide double staining were used to identify apoptotic cells. The activity of the key enzymes in polyamine catabolism was detected using chemiluminescence. TBP can induce apoptosis and significantly inhibit K562 cell proliferation in a time- and dose-dependent manner. TBP treatment significantly induced the enzyme activity of spermine oxidase and acetylpolyamine oxidase in K562 cells, and also enhanced the inhibitory effect of the antitumor drug doxorubicin on K562 cell proliferation. As a novel polyamine analog, TBP significantly inhibited proliferation and induced apoptosis in K562 cells by upregulating the activity of the key enzymes in the polyamine catabolic pathways. TBP also increased the sensitivity of the K562 cells to the antitumor drug doxorubicin. These data indicate an important potential value of TBP for clinical therapy of human CML.
