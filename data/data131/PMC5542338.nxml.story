All 26 patients who had played sport before their injuries returned fully to their previous sports, although most of the patients had been playing at recreational level before their injuries. Thirty-two patients returned fully to their previous jobs, whereas two patients (1 farmer and 1 manual worker) returned with reduced hours and workloads. Ninety-five of 102 shoulders (93.1%) had no graft tear or no re-tear of the repaired rotator cuff tendon during the follow-up period. Three shoulders (2.9%) with severe fatty degeneration of the infraspinatus tendon had re-tear of the repaired infraspinatus tendon at 3 months after surgery. Four shoulders (3.9%) suffered a postoperative graft tear by 3 months (2 patients) or 1 year (2 patients) after surgery. The average preoperative American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons (ASES) score was 31.6 points (range, 3.3 to 63.3 points). Average clinical outcome scores after arthroscopic superior capsule reconstruction all improved significantly at final follow-up (ASES, 93.3 points) (P < .00001). The shoulder active range of motion improved significantly after arthroscopic superior capsule reconstruction at the final follow-up: by 56.9° (92.4° to 149.3°) for elevation (P < .001), by 15.7° (26.0° to 41.6°) for external rotation (P < .01), and by three vertebral bodies (L4 to L1) for internal rotation (P < .01).
