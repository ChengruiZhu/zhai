Insulin resistance (IR) in humans is related to hypertension and impaired vasodilation. Insulin administration has been shown to lower blood pressure both in insulin resistant as well as in insulin sensitive individuals. The aim of the study was to investigate the association between insulin sensitivity and alterations in blood pressure in healthy horses before and after a euglycemic-hyperinsulinemic clamp (EHC). A 3-h EHC was performed in 13 healthy horses (11 mares, 2 geldings). Blood samples for measurement of plasma glucose and insulin were collected before the start of the EHC, every 10 min during the EHC and immediately after the EHC. Mean, systolic- and diastolic blood pressure was measured before and during the final 10 min of the EHC using an indirect high-definition oscillometric monitor (HDO, horse model) applied to the middle of the coccygeal artery. Five consecutive measurements were made in each horse and on each occasion. Insulin and glucose data from the EHC were used to calculate the mean rate of glucose disposal per unit of insulin during steady state (M/I ratio). Insulin resistance was defined as a M/I ratio <5 mg/kg/min/mUL (Lindåse et al. in Am J Vet Res 77:300–309,
