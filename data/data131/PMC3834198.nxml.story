Dual-specificity phosphatase 6 (DUSP6), a specific negative feedback regulator of phosphorylated extracellular signal-regulated kinase, was found to play an important role in numerous types of solid tumors as a tumor suppressor. In this study, 64.2% (61/95) of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) specimens studied exhibited reduced DUSP6 protein expression, compared with 91% (81/89) of normal esophageal specimens that displayed moderate or strong DUSP6 protein expression in tissue microarray analysis. In total, 36.8% (7/19) of the tumor biopsies displayed at least two-fold downregulation of DUSP6 compared with their paired normal counterparts, by qPCR. Significant loss of DUSP6 was observed in EC9706 and KYSE150 ESCC cell lines by immunoblotting assay. Low DUSP6 protein expression was significantly associated with pathological grade in ESCC by immunohistochemistry (P<0.05). Treatment with 5-aza-2â€²-deoxycytidine restored DUSP6 expression in the two ESCC cell lines, and the expression varied according to the drug concentration. Methylation-specific PCR analysis showed methylation-specific products in the two ESCC cell lines. We observed significant differences in the early and total apoptotic proportion between the control and experimental groups of the two ESCC cell lines and their transfectants (P<0.001) by annexin/propidium iodide assay. The presence of cleaved PARP product, a marker of caspase-mediated apoptosis, expressed in the two pCMV-DUSP6 transfectants in marked contrast to the parental and pCMV-transfected EC9706 and KYSE150 cells, was observed by immunoblotting. Overall, our results support the role of DUSP6 as a novel candidate tumor suppressor gene in ESCC, which may be a potential prognostic marker for ESCC.
