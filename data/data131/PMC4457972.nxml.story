Enterovesical fistula is an abnormal communication between the bladder and the intestine. The accurate localization of leakage is important for accurate treatment planning. Some imaging techniques can not demonstrate the fistula; therefore, choosing the appropriate imaging technique is necessary. CT enterography (CTE) is a new technique for evaluation of the small bowel and the entire abdomen. CTE examination with multi-detector CT (MDCT) enables us to get excellent quality reformatted images with high spatial resolution. We report a patient with neobladder and enteroneovesical fistula. We showed the exact location of the fistula and itsâ€™ association with the bowels and neobladder by CTE. The aim of this report is to show that CTE can be a new and effective modality in the detection of enteroneovesical fistulas and to discuss the efficacy of CTE in the detection and evaluation of enterovesical fistula referring to the literature. In conclusion, CTE may be a useful, sensitive, effective, and non-invasive technique for the evaluation of enteroneovesical fistula, leakage from the anastomose sides, and other extraintestinal complications such as urinary tract obstruction or abscess formation.
