Basaloid squamous cell carcinoma (BSCC) is a rare variant of squamous cell carcinoma. The occurrence of BSCC in the nasal cavity is extremely rare. In the present study, two cases of BSCC occurring in the maxillary sinus are reported and the clinicopathological features and immunohistochemical characteristics of this rare tumor are discussed. Two patients, aged 85 (case 1) and 60 years (case 2), presented with nasal tumors and persistent nasal obstruction. In each case, the biopsy or resected specimen of the maxillary sinus tumor revealed an infiltrative proliferation of solid epithelial nests composed of basaloid cells exhibiting hyperchromatic nuclei without conspicuous nucleoli and scant cytoplasm. Mitotic figures were frequently observed and spherical hyalinized materials were present within the tumor nests. Immunohistochemically, the tumor cells exhibited diffuse positive immunoreactivity for p63 and perinuclear dot-like positivity for vimentin, leading to a final diagnosis of BSCC of the maxillary sinus. Furthermore, it was demonstrated for the first time in the two cases that cathepsin K, a cysteine protease with marked collagenolytic and elastolytic activities, was expressed in a diffuse manner. One patient (case 2) succumbed to multiple metastases, while the other (case 1) remains alive with the disease. In conclusion, it was demonstrated that cathepsin K was immunopositive in two cases of BSCC of the maxillary sinus and that it may be involved in tumor invasion by this highly aggressive carcinoma.
