Bacterial chemotaxis is a paradigm for sensory systems, and thus has attracted immense interest from biologists and modelers alike. Using this pathway, cells can sense chemical molecules in their environment, and bias their movement towards nutrients and away from toxins. To avoid over- or understimulation of the signaling pathway, receptors adapt to current external conditions by covalent receptor modification, ultimately allowing cells to chemotax over a wide range of background concentrations. While the robustness and precision in adaptation was previously explained, we quantify the dynamics of adaptation, important for cell memory and behavior, as well as noise filtering in the pathway. Specifically, we study the intracellular signaling response and subsequent adaptation to concentration step changes in attractant chemicals. We combine measurements of signaling in living cells with a dynamic model for strongly coupled receptors, even including the effects of concentration flow in the experiment. Using a novel way of summarizing time-dependent data, we derive a new adaptation model, predicting additional layers of feedback regulation. As a consequence, adaptation to sudden exposure of unfavorable conditions is very fast, which may be useful for a quick reorientation and escape of the cell.
