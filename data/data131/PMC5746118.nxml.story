It has been drawn attention that secreted proteins with signal peptide from cancer cells provide new potential biomarkers of cancer. In this study, three lung adenocarcinoma cell lines and serum samples from 20 patients were used for identifying potential serologic tumor biomarker with proteomic and bioinformatics approaches. One-dimensional electrophoresis, and identified with mass spectrometry and database research were performed. We found17 secreted proteins in common, while another 17 proteins with signal peptide were identified in all three lung adenocarcinoma cell lines alone with patient samples. With matching these two groups of identified proteins, calsyntenin-1 (CLSTN1), clusterin (CLU) and neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL) were found highly secreted from both cell lines and serum with unique signal peptides. Therefore, in our study, we demonstrated that cancer cells secret specific proteins to the environment that may serve as unique markers for cancer diagnosis. To combination of proteomic study with bioinformatic prediction on signal peptides, higher expression level of CLSTN1, CLU and NGAL were found and may be new solid serologic biomarkers for patients with lung adenocarcinoma.
