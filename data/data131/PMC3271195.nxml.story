Living cells communicate with their microenvironment and exchange information through signaling pathways in order to carry out most biological processes. The CCN family of proteins has the ability to coordinate the extracellular and intracellular signaling pathways and epithelial-stromal cross-talks. CCN proteins have been shown to play roles in multiple processes including cancer, either as tumor suppressors or oncogenes. Particularly, loss of CCN6 expression has been reported in highly aggressive breast cancer types, especially in inflammatory breast cancer and breast cancer with axillary lymph node metastasis. Recent findings can better explain the biological relevance of CCN6 as a tumor suppressor protein in breast tumorigenesis. CCN6 loss triggers the process of epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT), which converts epithelial cells into migratory and invasive mesenchymal-like cells at least in part through modulation of IGF-1 receptor signaling pathway. Emerging data support the hypothesis that CCN6 also exerts growth factor independent functions, especially related to cell survival and anoikis resistance. Thus, our work provides new insights into the functions and mechanisms of tumor suppression exerted by CCN6 in the breast.
