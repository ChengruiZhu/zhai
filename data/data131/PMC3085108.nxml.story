A serum biomarker (FibroTest; Biopredictive, Paris, France; FibroSure; LabCorp, Burlington, USA) and liver stiffness measurement (LSM) by Fibroscan (Echosens, Paris, France) have been extensively validated in chronic hepatitis C. This review updates the clinical validation of serum biomarkers and LSM in patients with chronic hepatitis B (CHB). One meta-analysis combined all published studies and another used a database combining FibroTest individual data. Sensitivity analysis assessed the impact of several factors, including authors’ independence, length of biopsy, ethnicity, hepatitis B early antigen status, viral load, and alanine aminotransferase value. Only two biomarkers had several validations: FibroTest (8 studies, 1,842 patients), and Fibroscan (5 studies, 618 patients). For the diagnosis of advanced fibrosis, the standardized area under the receiver operating curve was 0.84 (0.79–0.86) for FibroTest and 0.89 (0.83–0.96) for LSM, without significant difference. No significant factors of variability were identified for FibroTest’s performance. In conclusion, FibroTest and LSM were the most validated biomarkers of fibrosis in CHB. However, the reliability of Fibroscan must be better assessed.
