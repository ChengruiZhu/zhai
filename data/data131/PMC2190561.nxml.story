. 112:411–418). We investigated a possible regulatory interplay between α3β1 and α6β4 in cell motility using HaCaT keratinocytes as a model. We found that α6β4 antibodies inhibit α3β1-mediated migration on Ln-5, but only when migration is haptotactic (i.e., spontaneous or stimulated by α3β1 activation), and not when chemotactic (i.e., triggered by epidermal growth factor receptor). Inhibition of migration by α6β4 depends upon phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3-K) since it is abolished by PI3-K blockers and by dominant-negative PI3-K, and constitutively active PI3-K prevents haptotaxis. In HaCaT cells incubated with anti–α6β4 antibodies, activation of PI3-K is mediated by α6β4-associated erbB-2, as indicated by erbB-2 autophosphorylation and erbB-2/p85 PI3-K coprecipitation. Furthermore, dominant-negative erbB-2 abolishes inhibition of haptotaxis by anti–α6β4 antibodies. These results support a model whereby (a) haptotactic cell migration on Ln-5 is regulated by concerted action of α3β1 and α6β4 integrins, (b) α6β4-associated erbB-2 and PI3-K negatively affect haptotaxis, and (c) chemotaxis on Ln-5 is not affected by α6β4 antibodies and may require PI3-K activity. This model could be of general relevance to motility of epithelial cells in contact with BM.
