Although glial cells substantially outnumber neurons in the mammalian brain, much remains to be discovered regarding their functions. Among glial cells, oligodendrocyte precursors differentiate into oligodendrocytes, whose function is to enwrap nerves with myelin to ensure proper impulse conduction. However, oligodendrocyte precursors also comprise a stable population in all major regions of the adult brain, making up around 5% of the total number of neurons and glia. Synapses are classically formed between neurons. Nonetheless, oligodendrocyte precursors are unique among glial cells in that they receive direct synaptic input from different types of neurons; whether OPC also send signals to neurons is still unknown. Here we show a bidirectional communication between neurons and oligodendrocyte precursors: neuronal activity regulates the cleavage of a glial membrane protein and the release of an extracellular domain that in turn modulates synaptic transmission between neurons. Our data thus show that a particular subtype of glial cells, oligodendrocyte precursors, functionally integrate into the neuronal network and we link this bidirectional signaling to mouse behavior and disease.
