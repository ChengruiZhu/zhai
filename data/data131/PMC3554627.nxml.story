The genome-wide association study (GWAS) is the primary tool to identify genetic variants that cause phenotypic variation. As GWAS methods are generally univariate in nature, multivariate phenotypic information is usually reduced to a single composite score, which frequently results in a considerable loss of statistical power to detect causal variants. Multivariate genotype–phenotype methods do exist but attain maximal power only in special circumstances. We present a new multivariate method called TATES (Trait-based Association Test that uses Extended Simes procedure). Extensive simulations show that TATES's false positive rate is correct, and that TATES's statistical power to detect causal variants explaining 0.5% of the variance can be 2.5–9 times higher than the power of univariate tests of composite scores and 1.5–2 times higher than the power of the standard MANOVA. Unlike other multivariate methods, TATES uncovers both genetic variants that are common to multiple phenotypes as well as phenotype specific variants. TATES thus provides a more complete view of the genetic architecture of complex traits and constitutes a powerful new multivariate strategy that allows researchers to identify novel causal variants.
