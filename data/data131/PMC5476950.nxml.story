Prostate cancer (PC) is the most common uro-oncological disease in the global population and still requires a more efficient laboratory diagnosis. Point mutations of oncogenes and tumor sup-pressor genes are the most frequent molecular genetic events in carcinogenesis. The mutations are re-sponsible, to a great extent, for the clonal evolution of cancer and can be considered as primary candi-date molecular markers of PC. Using next-generation sequencing to analyze the mutations in PC, the main molecular PC subtypes were identified, which depended on the presence of fusion genes and FOXA1, CHD1, and SPOP point mutations; other driver mutations responsible for the progression of PC subclones were also characterized. This review summarizes the data on early PC genetic markers (an mtDNA deletion, and TMPRSS2:ERG expression), as well as these somatic mutations at later stages of PC. Emphasis is placed on a switch in AR synthesis to a constitutively active variant and the point muta-tions that facilitate PC transition to a castration-refractory state that is resistant to new AR inhibitors. Based on the current whole-exome sequencing data, the frequencies and localizations of the somatic mu-tations that may provide new genetic diagnostic markers and drug targets are described.
