Transcript assembly and quantification are important bioinformatics applications of RNA-Seq. The difficulty of solving these problem arises from the ambiguity of reads assignment to isoforms uniquely. This challenge is twofold: statistically, it requires a high-dimensional mixture model, and computationally, it needs to process datasets that commonly consist of tens of millions of reads. Existing algorithms either use very complex models that are too slow or assume no models, rather heuristic, and thus less accurate. Strawberry seeks to achieve a great balance between the model complexity and speed. Strawberry effectively leverages a graph-based algorithm to utilize all possible information from pair-end reads and, to our knowledge, is the first to apply a flow network algorithm on the constrained assembly problem. We are also the first to formulate the quantification problem in a latent class model. All of these features not only lead to a more flexible and complex quantification model but also yield software that is easier to maintain and extend. In this method paper, we have shown that the Strawberry method is novel, accurate, fast and scalable using both simulated data and real data.
