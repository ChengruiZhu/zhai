These results suggest that the exact age of embryonic pig pancreatic tissue influences how well the transplanted tissue grows and integrates into a host from a different species (in this case, the mouse) and how strong an immune reaction it triggers. Overall, these results support the notion that pig embryonic pancreas tissue could potentially be a source of tissue for transplantation into human patients with diabetes. The next steps in exploring this possibility are likely to involve experiments in monkeys to find out how much tissue should be implanted and where, and to check that the transplanted tissue remains functional in these animals. The ability of the 42-day-old embryonic tissue to avoid direct immune rejection also needs to be confirmed. And, ideally, the goal remains to find ways to avoid an immune reaction altogether, so that recipients of transplants do not need to be continually treated with drugs that suppress their immune system (which makes them more susceptible to infections and can have other side effects). Xenotransplantation has potential benefits and risks and remains controversial. Studies like this one and others that seek to better understand the risks and benefits are necessary to allow reasonable decisions to be made.
