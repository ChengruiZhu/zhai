Lysyl oxidase (LOX) initiates the enzymatic stage of collagen and elastin cross-linking. It also has intracellular functions involved in the regulation of cell differentiation, motility/migration and gene transcription. Aberrant expression of the LOX gene has been reported in multiple tumors. However, the correlation of its expression with clinicopathological parameters and its prognostic significance in gastric cancer remains largely unknown. In order to address this problem, total RNA of paired tissue samples (n=10) and a tissue microarray containing 161 paired tissues from patients with gastric cancers at different stages were collected. Quantitative real-time PCR and immunochemistry assay were conducted to investigate the expression of LOX. Based on the results, LOX mRNA was increased in gastric cancer tissues compared with the adjacent normal mucosa. Immunohistochemical detection revealed that expression of LOX was associated with depth of tumor invasion (P<0.05), lymph node status (P<0.05), TNM stage (P<0.05) and survival (P<0.05). Cox regression analysis revealed that positive expression of LOX (P=0.026) was an independent prognostic marker for survival in patients with gastric cancer.
