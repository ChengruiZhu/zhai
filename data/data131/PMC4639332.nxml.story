Mean values of IVSd recorded in GB is IVSd=17.5 mm (n=20, 95% CI, 16.00–19.00 mm), while a significantly smaller mean value is recorded in GA, IVSd=10.0 mm (n=40, 95% CI, 9.00-11.00 mm). The mean value of the left ventricle in diastole (LVDd) recorded in the GA is LVDd=51 mm (n=40; 95% CI, 48.00 to 52.00 mm), while in the group with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (GB) mean LVDd value is 42 mm (n=20; 95% CI, 40.00 to 48.00 mm). The mean value of the rear wall of the left ventricle (LVPWd) recorded in the GA is LVDd=10 mm (n=40; 95% CI, 9.00-10.00 mm) while in the group with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (GB) mean LVDd is 14 mm (n=20; 95% CI, 12.00 to 16.00 mm). The mean of the left ventricle during systole (LVSD) observed in GA is LVSD=34 mm (n=40; 95% CI, 32.00 to 36.00 mm), while in the group with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (GB) mean LVSD is 28 mm (n=20; 95% CI, 24.00 to 28.83 mm). The mean ejection fraction (EF%) observed in GA is EF=60% (n=40; 95% CI, 56.41 to 63.00%), while in the group with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (GB) mean EF value is 69% (n=20; 95% CI, 62.00 to 70.83 mm). Somewhat higher mean diastolic left ventricular function (E/A) was observed in GA, E/A=1.76±0.15, and lower average values in the group with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy: (GB) E/A=0.78±0.02.
