We have long known that there are rhythmic oscillations in the mammalian brain. Although the power in these rhythms changes during behavior, their relevance for brain function has been something of a mystery. In this study, the particular role of rhythms in human motor cortex was studied both during rest and during engagement in different finger movements. Arrays of electrocorticographic electrodes were placed directly on frontal, temporal, and parietal brain surfaces to measure the electrical potential. These measurements reveal that movement of different fingers produces spatially focal and finger-specific changes in local neuronal population activity, along with spatially diffuse and finger-nonspecific decreases in 12–20 Hz β-rhythm power. Apart from these power changes, there are independent interactions between the β-rhythm and local cortical activity. During rest, 5–20% of the variation in local cortical activity is due to entrainment on the phase of the β-rhythm over the pre- and post-central gyri, but the interaction is significantly diminished during movement. This shifting entrainment suggests that the β-rhythm is not simply a background process that is suppressed during movement, but rather that the β-rhythm plays an active and important role in motor processing.
