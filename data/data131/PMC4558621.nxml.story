 = 40 eyes) without other identified pathologies participated in this study: 20 eyes of ≤ 3 diopters (D) (low myopic), 10 eyes between −3 and −6D (moderate myopic), and 10 eyes of ≥ 6D (high myopic). The mean age of subjects was 30.2 years (± 7.6 years; range, 24 to 46 years). A 1050 nm spectral-domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT) system, operating at 120 kHz imaging rate, was used in this study to simultaneously capture 3D anatomical images of the choroid and measure intraocular length (IOL) in the subject. The 3D OCT images of the choroid were segmented into superior, inferior, nasal and temporal quadrants, from which the CT was measured, representing radial distance between the outer retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) layer and inner scleral border. Measurements were made within concentric regions centered at fovea centralis, extended to 5 mm away from fovea at 1 mm intervals in the nasal and temporal directions. The measured IOL was the distance from the anterior cornea surface to the RPE in alignment along the optical axis of the eye. Statistical analysis was performed to evaluate CT at each geographic region and observe the relationship between CT and the degree of myopia.
