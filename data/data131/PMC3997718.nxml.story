A number of scientific studies have revealed that laminarin has antitumor effects. Therefore, the aim of the present study was to investigate the apoptosis of LoVo cells and the underlying mechanisms induced by laminarin. LoVo cells were treated with various concentrations of laminarin and fluorescence-inverted microscopy was used to observe the morphology of LoVo cells treated with laminarin. In addition, western blotting was performed to analyze the expression levels of death receptor (DR)4, DR5, TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL), Fas-associated protein with death domain (FADD), caspase-8, caspase-3, Bid and tBid. Flow cytometry was conducted to analyze the expressions of Bcl-2 and Bax, and spectrophotometry was performed to quantify the activity of caspases-8, -3, -6 and -7. Following the treatment of LoVo cells with laminarin for 24 h, the expression levels of DR4, DR5, TRAIL, FADD, Bid, tBid and Bax were observed to be upregulated, whereas the expression levels of pro-caspase-8, pro-caspase-3 and Bcl-2 were downregulated. In addition, the activities of casapse-8, -3, -6 and -7 were observed to increase, which was a significant difference when compared with those of the control group. Therefore, laminarin is considered to induce the apoptosis of LoVo cells, which may occur via a DR pathway, suggesting that laminarin may be a potent agent for cancer treatment.
