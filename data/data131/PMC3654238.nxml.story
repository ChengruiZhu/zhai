This study was conducted to investigate the protective effect of erythropoietin (EPO) on ischemia/reperfusion related changes after testicular torsion/detorsion. In a randomized experimental trial 30 male rats were randomly allocated into six equal groups of five rats each. Group I (orchiectomy for histopathologic examination), group II (sham operation), group III (torsion for 2 hours, and ischemia/detorsion for 24 hours, and orchiectomy); group IV (torsion for 2 hours, ischemia/detorsion for 24 hours with erythropoietin injection then orchiectomy), group V (torsion for 2 hours and detorsion and EPO injection and orchiectomy 1 week later, group VI (torsion for 2 hours/detorsion and orchiectomy 1 week later). Two groups (groups 4 and 5) received different protocols of erythropoietin administration after testicular torsion/distortion. other groups were not receiving erythropoietin. Johnsen's spermatogenesis scoring method and Cosentino's histologic staging method were used to assess main outcome measures of the study. After the experimentation, Johnsen's score in EPO Groups was statistically different from the score in some groups not receiving erythropoietin. Cosentino's score in EPO groups was statistically different from the score in all groups not receiving erythropoietin. Neovascularization, vascular necrosis, vascular congestion, edema, hemorrhage, and acute inflammation were observed in some groups. This study shows short-term protective efficacy of erythropoietin on rat testicular injury after ischemia/reperfusion.
