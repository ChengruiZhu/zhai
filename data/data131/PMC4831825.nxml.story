Accumulation of RNA polymerase II (Pol II) in the promoter proximal region has been proposed to be important for rapid gene activation, but the full regulatory role of Pol II dynamics is yet to be delineated. Defining polymerase poising as a significant enrichment of accumulation of Pol II near the promoter, and comparing Pol II profiles in resting and activated B cells, we found that Pol II poised genes generally overlap functionally among different B cell states and correspond to the functional groups identified for poised genes in other cell types. In contrast, non-poised genes are B cell state specific. Interestingly, the transition from poised to non-poised state was not associated exclusively with B cell activation. We found quite a few genes expressed in resting B cells that transitioned from non-poised to poised state after cell activation including several Immediate Early Genes (IEGs)â€”genes which are known to be activated transiently and rapidly in response to a wide variety of cellular stimuli. In addition, we observed an enrichment of G4 sequence motifs upstream of TSS of non-poised but active genes, including IEG genes. We propose that formation of quadruplexes upstream of TSS can facilitate Pol II engagement by destabilizing the DNA duplex. Taken together, our analysis of resting and activated B cells allowed us to provide novel insight into the dynamics of Pol II poising.
