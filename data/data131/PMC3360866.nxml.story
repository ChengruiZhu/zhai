, several 50%-stenotic coronary artery phantoms were designed with 5 μm resolution, realistic morphology and tissue-specific Hounsfield Unit (HU) values. The plaque had an attenuation resembling fibrous plaque and contained a single calcification. X-ray projections were simulated with settings resembling non-contrast-enhanced 64 multi detector-row CT (64-MDCT). Scanning and reconstruction were simulated with spatial resolution of a 64-MDCT (0.4mm) and of a MicroCT (48 μm). Starting from a single calcium granule, the calcification was simulated to grow in size and attenuation until it could be detected using clinically accepted calcium determination scheme on MicroCT and 64-MDCT images. The smallest coronary calcifications detectable at MicroCT and 64-MDCT, which had a realistic attenuation (−1,024 to 3,072 HU), were of 25 μm and 215 μm diameter, respectively. The area was overestimated 7.7 and 8.8 times, respectively. Calcifications with smaller size need to have an unrealistically high attenuation to be detectable by 64-MDCT. In conclusion, 64-MDCT is only able to detect coronary calcifications with minimal diameter of 215 μm. Consequently, early onset of calcification in coronary plaque will remain invisible when using CT and a zero calcium score can not exclude the presence of coronary calcification.
