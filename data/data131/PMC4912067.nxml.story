Natural bacterial communities are usually very species-rich and bacterial cells within these communities often exchange metabolites with each other. Whether and to which extent obligate metabolic interactions can contribute to maintaining the observed bacterial diversity, however, is not known. In this study, we address this question computationally, by simulating populations of six different bacterial strains that differ in their requirement to obtain amino acids from the environment as well as their propensity to release other amino acids. By systematically varying key variables such as the cost of metabolite production, the speed with which metabolites diffuse in the environment, as well as the amino acid availability in the environment, we show that a cooperative exchange of essential amino acids is evolutionary stable over a broad range of biologically realistic conditions. In particular spatially structured environments, such as bacterial biofilms, and moderate costs of metabolite production favored metabolic interactions. Finally, our work identifies obligate metabolic interactions as a powerful ecological mechanism to maintain different bacterial genotypes with microbial communities.
