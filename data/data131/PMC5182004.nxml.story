Stathmin1, a microtubule-destabilizing phosphoprotein, is considered to play a crucial role in regulating cellular microtubule dynamics and controlling mitosis. Previous studies have showed that STMN1 is highly expressed in many human malignancies and is related to development, invasion and metastasis of tumors. However, its expression pattern, clinical performance and functional roles in hypopharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma (HSCC) have not been addressed. In this study, we found that STMN1 was significantly elevated in HSCC and its expression level was correlated with poor differentiation (P<0.001), clinical stage (P<0.001), large tumor size (P=0.001) and lymph node metastasis (P=0.008). A positive correlation between STMN1 and Ki-67 expression was also exhibited. High STMN1 expression predicted poor survival. Furthermore, we found that knockdown of STMN1 by siRNAs inhibited the FaDu cell proliferation and migration. Moreover, decreased STMN1 expression in FaDu cells reversed the acquisition of EMT phenotype by upregulating E-cadherin, as well as reduced vimentin expression at protein and mRNA levels. These results suggested that STMN1 plays an important role in proliferation and migration of HSCC and may be used as a potential prognostic biomarker or therapeutic target of HSCC.
