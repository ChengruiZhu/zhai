Coracoid fractures are rarely seen fractures. In the shoulder girdle, coracoid process fractures generally accompany dislocation of the acromioclavicular joint or glenohumeral joint, scapula corpus, clavicula, humerus fracture, or rotator cuff tear. Coracoid fractures can be missed and the treatment for coracoid process fractures is still controversial. In this paper, a 34-year-old male manual labourer presented to the emergency department with complaints of pain and restricted movement in the left shoulder following a traffic accident. On direct radiographs and computerised tomography images a fragmented fracture was observed on the base of the coracoid process. In addition to the coracoid fracture, a mandibular fracture was determined. The patient was admitted for surgery on both fractures. After open reduction, fixation was made with a 3.5â€‰mm cannulated screw and washer. At the postoperative 6th week, bone union was determined. The patient returned to his previous occupation pain-free and with a full range of joint movement. In conclusion, in the current case of isolated fragmented coracoid process fracture showing minimal displacement in a patient engaged in heavy manual work, surgery was preferred as it was thought that nonunion might be encountered particularly because of the effect of forces around the coracoid.
