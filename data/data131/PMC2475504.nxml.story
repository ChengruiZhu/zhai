In large-scale studies of population genetic data, particularly genome-wide association studies, considerable effort may be spent on quality control (QC) to ensure genotype data are accurate. Typically, QC steps are applied independently to individual marker loci, with data from suspicious loci being excluded from subsequent analyses. Here we present a new QC tool, which exploits the fact that correlation of alleles among nearby genetic loci (linkage disequilibrium; LD) provides a certain amount of redundancy in genotype information, and that high rates of genotyping error at a marker may leave their trace in unusual patterns of LD. The method (a) aids in the detection of SNP loci with possibly elevated levels of genotyping error, and (b) in some cases allows for the correction of erroneous genotype calls, thereby salvaging some of the genotype data from the QC filtering process. We confirm on data from real populations that SNPs identified by this approach do show evidence for containing actual genotyping errors, and we also examine genotype intensity plots to confirm that many individual genotypes corrected by the method do appear to be called in error. More generally, these results demonstrate the potential utility of incorporating LD information into algorithms for processing and analyzing population genotype data.
