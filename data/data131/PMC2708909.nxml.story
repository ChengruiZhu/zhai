The DNA molecule is used as a template for duplication, to transmit genetic information to the progeny of a given cell, but also as a template for the transcription machinery. This machinery converts genetic information from the DNA form to the RNA form used for protein synthesis. Chemical alterations of the DNA molecule caused by endogenous or environmental stresses are responsible for the generation of mutations. Indeed, these lesions can induce replication errors when DNA is duplicated during cell division. These mutations have been shown to be responsible for many genetic diseases and other sporadic diseases, such as cancer. However, less is known about their effects on transcription. We report here that a specific DNA lesion may lead to erroneous transcription events, ultimately leading to the production of aberrant proteins. The magnitude of these errors seems to depend largely on the DNA sequences surrounding the lesion and the capacity of the cell to repair this lesion. We also show that the production of aberrant protein from the erroneous transcription products may affect the phenotype of the cells concerned. Lesion-induced transcription errors may also play a role in the development of neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases.
