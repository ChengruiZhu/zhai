The immune system's natural killer cells eliminate diseased cells in the body. They do so by secreting toxic molecules directly towards the diseased cells, so causing their death. This process is essential for the host organism to defend itself against infectious diseases. The interface between the natural killer cell and its target—the lytic immunological synapse—forms by close apposition of the surface membranes of the two cells. It is characterized by coordinated rearrangement of proteins to allow lytic granules, which contain the toxic molecules, to fuse with the cell surface at the synapse. Given the large size of the granules, one challenge the natural killer cell faces is how to contend with network of actin filaments just under the cell surface, which potentially could pose a barrier to secretion. The current model proposes large-scale clearing of actin filaments from the center of the immunological synapse to provide granules access to the synaptic membrane. By using very high-resolution imaging techniques, we now demonstrate that actin filaments are present throughout the synapse and that natural killer cells overcome the actin barrier not by wholesale clearing but by making minimally sufficient conduits in the actin network. This suggests a model in which granules access the surface membrane by means of specific and facilitated contact with the actin cytoskeleton.
