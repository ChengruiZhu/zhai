Signals, and hence information, can generally be transmitted either by amplitude (AM) or frequency (FM) modulation, as used, for example, in the transmission of radio waves since the 1930s. Both types of modulation are known to play a role in biology with AM conventionally associated with signaling and gene expression, and FM used to reliably transmit electrical signals over large distances between neurons. Surprisingly, FM was recently also observed in gene regulation, making their roles less distinct than previously thought. Although the engineering advantages and disadvantages of AM and FM are well understood, the equivalent question in biological systems is still largely unsolved. Here, we propose a simple model of signaling by receptors (or ion channels) with subsequent gene regulation, thus implementing both AM and FM in different types of biological pathways. We then compare the accuracy in the production of target proteins. We find that FM can be more accurate than AM only for a single receptor with fast signaling, whereas AM is more accurate in slow gene regulation and with signaling by multiple receptors. Finally, we propose possible reasons that cells use FM despite the potential decrease in accuracy.
