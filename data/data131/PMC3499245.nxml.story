Bdelloid rotifers are tiny invertebrates with unusual characteristics: they withstand stresses, such as desiccation and high levels of ionising radiation, that kill other animals, and they have survived over millions of years without sexual reproduction, which contradicts theories on the evolutionary advantages of sex. In this study, we investigate another bizarre feature of bdelloids, namely their ability to acquire genes from other organisms in a process known as horizontal gene transfer (HGT). We show that HGT happens on an unprecedented scale in bdelloids: approximately 10% of active genes are “foreign,” mostly originating from bacteria and other simple organisms like fungi and algae, but now functioning as bdelloid genes. About 80% of foreign genes code for enzymes, and these make a major contribution to bdelloid biochemistry: 39% of enzyme activities have a foreign contribution, and in 23% of cases the activity in question is uniquely specified by a foreign gene. This indicates biochemistry, such as toxin degradation and antioxidant generation, that is unknown in other animals and that is expected to improve the “robustness” of the bdelloid. It also represents a possible mechanism for survival without sex, by diversification of functional capacity and even replacement of defective genes by foreign counterparts.
