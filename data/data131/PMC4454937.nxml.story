In this paper the total concentration of As, Cr, Sb, pH and the red-ox potential of water and sediment samples of the Biała Przemsza River were determined. The arsenic (AB, MMA, DMA, As(III), As(V)), chromium (Cr(III), Cr(VI)) and antimony (Sb(III), Sb(V)) forms were studied by HPLC-ICP-MS. Ions were successfully separated on Hamilton PRP-X100: (AB, MMA, DMA, As(III), As(V)), Dionex Ion Pac AS-7 (Sb(III), Sb(V)) and Dionex IonPac AG7 columns: Cr(III), Cr(VI) with LOD 0.16 μg/L, 0.08 μg/L, 0.09 μg/L, 0.012 μg/L, 0.08 μg/L, 0.12 μg/L, 0.009 μg/L, 0.012 μg/L, 0.19 μg/L, 0.37 μg/L, respectively. The simplified BCR three-step sequential chemical extraction was performed on the bottom sediment samples. The samples were collected monthly, between April and December 2014, at five sampling points. Large contents of manganese, lead, cadmium and zinc were found in the Biała Przemsza River water. In December 2014, the lead content in the bottom sediment in Sławków was nearly 6000 mg/kg. In the river water, only the inorganic arsenic speciation forms were found. Sb(V), As(V) and Cr(III) were dominant. Studies have shown that arsenic, antimony and chromium were mainly bound to oxides, organic matter and sulphides in the bottom sediments.
