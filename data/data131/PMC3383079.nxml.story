The trans-septal suturing method has been developed in septoplasty as an alternative to packing. This study was carried out to compare the postoperative results of trans-septal suturing with the anterior Merocel packing technique. The study involved 697 patients who underwent septoplasty. Following surgery, patients were randomly divided into two groups, one with trans-septal suturing and the other with Merocel packing. Patients were asked to record pain levels using a visual analogue scale. Postoperative symptoms and complications were compared. A total of 697 nasal operations were evaluated in the postoperative period considering pain, bleeding, haematoma, septal perforation synechiae and septal perforation. The results for haemorrhage, haematoma, synechiae and perforation were not statistically different (p > 0.05) between groups. In contrast, the level of postoperative pain in patients undergoing trans-septal suturing was significantly less than in the group who received Merocel packing (p < 0.05). Patients with Merocel packing had significantly more pain and nasal discomfort when assessed 1 week after intervention. Therefore, the trans-septal suturing technique may be the preferred option to provide higher patient satisfaction.
