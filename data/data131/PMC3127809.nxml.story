Release of glutamate from one neuron onto glutamate receptors on adjacent neurons serves as the primary basis for neuronal communication. Further, different types of glutamate signals produce unique responses within the neuronal network, providing the ability for glutamate receptors to discriminate between alternative types of signaling. The NMDA receptor (NMDAR) is a glutamate receptor that mediates a variety of physiological functions, including the molecular basis for learning and memory. These receptors exist as a variety of subtypes, and this molecular heterogeneity is used to explain the diversity in signaling initiated by NMDARs. However, the lack of reliable experimental tools to control the activation of each subtype has led to debate over the subtype specific roles of the NMDAR. We have developed a stochastic model of glutamate receptor activation at a single synapse and find that NMDAR subtypes detect different types of glutamate signals. Moreover, the presence of multiple populations of NMDAR subtypes on a given neuron allows for differential patterns of NMDAR activation in response to varied glutamate inputs. This model demonstrates how NMDAR subtypes enable effective and reliable communication within neuronal networks and can be used as a tool to examine specific roles of NMDAR subtypes in neuronal function.
