T-cell lineage lymphoma with an intense membranous and paranuclear CD30 expression in the absence of ALK1 raises a differential diagnosis of peripheral T-cell lymphoma (PTCL), NOS and anaplastic large cell lymphoma (ALCL), ALK negative. However, Epstein-Barr virus is consistently negative in ALCL and is not considered an implicating factor in its pathogenesis. We describe a case of T-cell lymphoma showing anaplastic large cell morphology with scattered hallmark cells and a uniform CD30 and Epstein-Barr virus encoded early RNA (EBER) expression that primarily involved the subcutaneous tissue at presentation. On incisional biopsy, the neoplastic cells were positive for CD3, CD2, and CD30 while negative for LCA, CD20, PAX5, CD56, ALK1, and cytotoxic granules. Molecular analysis identified a positive T-cell receptor (beta and gamma) gene rearrangement by PCR. Proliferation index approached 100% and the patient had a rapidly progressive course; the subcutaneous lesions more than doubled in size within couple of weeks with new evidence for widespread systemic involvement. This case emphasizes a rare EBV association with a CD30 positive T-cell lymphoma where the morphologic and immunophenotypic findings are otherwise nondiscriminatory between PTCL, NOS and ALCL, ALK negative.
