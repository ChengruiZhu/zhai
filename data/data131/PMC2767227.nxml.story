 the largest existing set of text-mined statements; we also presented its application to an important biological problem. We have extracted and purified two large molecular networks, one for humans and one for mouse. We characterized the data sets, described the methods we used to generate them, and presented a novel biological application of the networks to study the etiology of five cerebellum phenotypes. We demonstrated quantitatively that the development-related malformations differ in their system-level properties from degeneration-related genes. We showed that there is a high degree of overlap among the genes implicated in the developmental malformations, that these genes have a strong tendency to be highly connected within the molecular network, and that they also tend to be clustered together, forming a compact molecular network neighborhood. In contrast, the genes involved in malformations due to degeneration do not have a high degree of connectivity, are not strongly clustered in the network, and do not overlap significantly with the development related genes. In addition, taking into account the above-mentioned system-level properties and the gene-specific network interactions, we made highly confident predictions about novel genes that are likely also involved in the etiology of the analyzed phenotypes.
