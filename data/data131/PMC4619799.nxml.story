Misfolding and aggregation of several proteins are known to be related to neurodegenerative diseases. Among them, polyglutamine expansions are known to be responsible for at least 9 diseases, including Huntington. Nonetheless, the structural properties of these intrinsically disordered proteins are difficult to study using classical techniques because of their rapid fluctuations that result in high conformational polymorphism. Here, we use molecular dynamics simulations to study polyglutamines of different chain lengths, starting with short non-pathogenic ones, and study the independent structures they are able to form. We characterize all structures by their geometrical properties, connectivity, putative mechanical stability and residence time (life span). Similar to the findings of a previous study with polyvalines, only some of the conformers are similar to those found in natural globular proteins. Moreover, we find structures that contain knots in both polyglutamine and polyvaline 60-mers, although the former contains many more knotted conformers than the latter. We suggest that these knotted conformers may impair the cell machinery for degradation and eventually lead to toxicity.
