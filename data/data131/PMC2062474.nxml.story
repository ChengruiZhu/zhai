Mitochondria are compartments from the eukaryotic cell that originated from the endosymbiosys of an alpha-proteobacterium. The bacterial-like metabolism of this early endosymbiont was thought to differ substantially from that of modern mitochondria, but so far we do not know the details of this bacterium-to-organelle transformation. To address this issue, we used an evolutionary approach to find genes derived from the ancestor of mitochondria. By identifying eukaryotic genes that are closely related to alpha-proteobacterial ones, we reconstructed a set of genes derived from the mitochondrial ancestor. We used that set to infer the ancestral mitochondrial metabolism, and subsequently compared it with those of modern mitochondria, as reconstructed from proteomics data from yeast and human. This allowed us to trace the metabolic evolution of mitochondria. What we found is that there has been a large turnover of the protein content of mitochondria, which has affected some pathways more than others. Pathways for protein synthesis and those involved in energy conversion have been preferentially retained in the mitochondrion, whereas those involved in replication, transcription, cell division, transport, regulation, and signal transduction have been replaced by eukaryotic proteins. Our findings show how the eukaryotic host has taken control of the endosymbiont, effectively hijacking those pathways that it could use.
