The regular accumulation of nanoparticles in the liver makes them hepatotoxic and decreases the circulation time, thus reducing their therapeutic effect. Resolving this problem will be significant in improving bioavailability and reducing side effects. In this study, we reduced the phagocytosis of epirubicin (EPI)-loaded folic acid-conjugated pullulan acetate (FPA/EPI) nanoparticles by Kupffer cells (KCs) through internalization and nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kB) signal pathway inhibitors, thus allowing development of FPA/EPI nanoparticles as a nanodrug delivery system (NDDS) based on our previous study. FPA/EPI nanoparticles were prepared by the dialysis method. Rat KCs were preincubated with the following individual or compound inhibitors: chlorpromazine (CPZ), nystatin (NY), colchicine (Col), amiloride (AMR), and pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate (PDTC). Dose- and time-dependent cellular uptake effects of inhibitors on FPA/EPI nanoparticles were determined through fluorometry. The cytokine levels of tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α), interleukin-1 beta (IL-1β), and IL-6 were tested in culture supernatants by bead-based multiplex flow cytometry. The uptake study demonstrated that inhibitors had an obvious inhibitory effect (
