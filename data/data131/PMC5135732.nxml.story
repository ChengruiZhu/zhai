Heart, SAT, and PrAT samples are collected from autopsied subjects in a general autopsy service, with the written informed consent of the next-of-kin (NOK). Sociodemographic and clinical data are obtained from a semistructure interview with the NOK. Coronary arteries are dissected and PAT are removed. Sections with the greatest arterial obstruction or unstable plaques, and the local with absence of atherosclerosis in all coronary arteries are sampled. PAT are represented adjacent to these fragments. Adipose tissues are fixed in 4% buffered paraformaldehyde solution and analyzed immunohistochemically for macrophages (CD68), macrophage polarization (CD11c for proinflammatory and CD206 for anti-inflammatory), B lymphocytes (CD20), and T lymphocytes (CD3). Slides will be scanned, and inflammatory cells will be quantified in 20 random fields. Participants will be categorized in CAD groups, after morphometric measurement of arterial obstruction and plaque composition analysis in accordance with American Heart Association classification. Three study groups will be investigated: acute CAD (at least one unstable plaque); chronic CAD (â‰¥50% arterial obstruction); and controls (<50% arterial obstruction). Inflammatory cells in PAT, SAT, and PrAT will be counted and compared between groups using multivariate linear regression, adjusted for age, body mass index, hypertension, diabetes, alcohol use, and smoking.
