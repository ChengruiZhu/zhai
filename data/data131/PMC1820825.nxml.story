The assembly and folding of secreted proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is exquisitely regulated by a complex mechanism that maintains an equilibrium between folded and unfolded proteins. Perturbation of this homeostasis induces ER stress, which, if not alleviated through ER stress signaling (ERSS), ultimately triggers cell death. Normal bone growth occurs through a highly coordinated differentiation program that yields specialized cartilage cells (chondrocytes); when this program is disrupted, chondrodysplasia, or malformed skeletons, can result. Chondrodysplasias caused by mutations that affect protein assembly and secretion are characterized by a disorganization of bony growth plates and distension of the ER. We tested whether these chondrodysplasia characteristics were linked to ERSS. By investigating the impact of ER stress on the cell fate of hypertrophic chondrocytes (HCs) in transgenic mice expressing mutations in collagen that prevent proper folding, we revealed a novel adaptive mechanism that helps alleviate the unfolded protein load. Instead of undergoing apoptosis, the HCs undergoing ER stress adapt, re-enter the cell cycle, and revert to a less-mature state in which expression of the mutant collagen is reduced. Our findings have broad implications for adaptive mechanisms to ER stress in vivo and for the pathophysiology underlying chondrodysplasias caused by mutations that impact on protein assembly and secretion.
