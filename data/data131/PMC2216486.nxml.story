The electrophysiological properties of a human neuroblastoma cell line, LA-N-5, were studied with the whole-cell configuration of the patch clamp technique before and after the induction of differentiation by retinoic acid, a vitamin A metabolite. Action potentials could be elicited from current clamped cells before the induction of differentiation, suggesting that some neuroblasts of the developing sympathetic nervous system are excitable. The action potential upstroke was carried by a sodium conductance, which was composed of two types of sodium currents, described by their sensitivity to tetrodotoxin (TTX) as TTX sensitive and TTX resistant. TTX-sensitive and TTX-resistant sodium currents were blocked by nanomolar and micromolar concentrations of TTX, respectively. The voltage sensitivity of activation and inactivation of TTX-resistant sodium current is shifted -10 to -30 mV relative to TTX-sensitive sodium current, suggesting that TTX-resistant sodium current could play a role in the initiation of action potentials. TTX-sensitive current comprised greater than 80% of the total sodium current in undifferentiated LA-N-5 cells. The surface density of total sodium current increased from 24.9 to 57.8 microA/microF after cells were induced to differentiate. The increase in total sodium current density was significant (P less than 0.05). The surface density of TTX-resistant sodium current did not change significantly during differentiation, from which we conclude that an increase in TTX-sensitive sodium current underlies the increase in total current.
