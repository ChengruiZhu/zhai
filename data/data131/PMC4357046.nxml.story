Khat is a stimulating agent used by many people in the Horn of Africa and the Arabian peninsula. Khat chewing is a known cardiovascular risk factor and is thought to cause vasoconstriction, systemic hypertension, and thrombogenicity. A 33-year-old Somalian man initially presented with loss of neurological function of the left arm, hazy vision, and headache. He smokes tobacco and chews two bundles of khat a week for more than 10 years. His ECG on admission showed a Q wave in V1 and V2 and 2â€‰mm ST-elevations in V1, V2, and V3 and a terminal negative T wave in I, aVL, V2, V3, and V4, consistent with a recent, evolving anterior infarction. A noncontrast enhanced CT of the brain showed ischemia in the right middle cerebral artery vascular territory. An MRI showed recent ischemia in the vascular territory of the posterior division of the right middle cerebral artery. Coronary angiography showed a 70% stenosis with haziness of the proximal left anterior descending artery. Diagnostic tests and imaging are consistent with recent myocardial infarction in the LAD vascular territory because of coronary spasm and cerebral infarction in the middle cerebral artery vascular territory probably related to khat chewing.
