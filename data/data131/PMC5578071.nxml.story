Because of the absence of the time course of histological nonalcoholic fatty hepatitis with subsequent fibrotic progression, the effective approaches available for controlling the onset and progression of non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) remain limited. Therefore, we detected the serum and liver tissue related lipid metabolism disorder, liver pathology and relative molecular makers alteration dynamically in a high fat-sucrose diet during different time points. High fat-sucrose diet significantly increased the serum lipid level on day 10. The excess lipid accumulation in liver was referred to as simple steatosis after the feeding of a high fat-sucrose diet for 20 days. The high fat-sucrose diet induced a hepatic inflammation response on day 30. Similarly, hepatic fibrosis was also initiated on day 30 and gradually formed from the 30th to the 50th day. Oxidative stress may be related with the process from NASH to liver fibrosis. Insulin resistance was involved in the progression from hepatic steatosis to NASH with hepatic fibrosis from the 20th to the 50th day. In conclusion, we established a high fat-sucrose diet induced nonalcoholic fatty hepatitis with liver fibrosis rat model, which presented the time course of histological nonalcoholic steatohepatitis and the initiation and progression change of characteristic molecular makers in the process from steatosis to hepatic fibrosis.
