Several studies have highlighted the prognostic value of the individual and the various combinations of the tumor markers for gastric cancer (GC). Our study was designed to assess establish a new novel model incorporating carcino-embryonic antigen (CEA), carbohydrate antigen 19-9 (CA19-9), carbohydrate antigen 72-4 (CA72-4). A total of 1,566 GC patients (Primary cohort) between Jan 2000 and July 2013 were analyzed. The Primary cohort was randomly divided into Training set (n=783) and Validation set (n=783). A three-tumor marker classifier was developed in the Training set and validated in the Validation set by multivariate regression and risk-score analysis. We have identified a three-tumor marker classifier (including CEA, CA19-9 and CA72-4) for the cancer specific survival (CSS) of GC (p<0.001). Consistent results were obtained in the both Training set and Validation set. Multivariate analysis showed that the classifier was an independent predictor of GC (All p value <0.001 in the Training set, Validation set and Primary cohort). Furthermore, when the leave-one-out approach was performed, the classifier showed superior predictive value to the individual or two of them (with the highest AUC (Area Under Curve); 0.618 for the Training set, and 0.625 for the Validation set), which ascertained its predictive value. Our three-tumor marker classifier is closely associated with the CSS of GC and may serve as a novel model for future decisions concerning treatments.
