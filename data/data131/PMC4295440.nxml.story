Gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST) is defined as a c-kit-positive gastrointestinal, mesenteric, or omental mesenchymal tumor that very rarely metastasizes to the brain. Metastasis to the cerebellum is particularly rare. An 80-year-old man presented with nausea and vomiting with disturbance of consciousness. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed tumor in the cerebellar vermis causing obstructive hydrocephalus. The patient subsequently underwent midline suboccipital craniotomy, and the tumor was totally removed. Immunohistochemical analysis showed tumor cells positive for c-kit and CD34, and cerebellar metastasis of GIST was diagnosed. Postoperative radiotherapy was administered. Following surgery and radiotherapy, the patient developed ileus caused by tumor in the small intestine and underwent laparotomy for tumor removal. Following abdominal surgery, left hemiparesis and consciousness disturbance were noted. Computed tomography showed recurrent large tumor with perifocal edema in the right frontal lobe of the brain. The patient died 3 months after initial craniotomy. Intracranial metastasis of GIST is extremely rare. In cases such as the present, where the condition of the patient rapidly deteriorates and features such as rising intracranial pressure and ileus prevent the use of oral agents, molecular-targeted agents administered by intravenous infusion should be utilized.
