The median survival rate of patients with metastatic renal carcinoma is approximately 10 to 12 months, with up to 50% of patients developing metastases in the lung parenchyma. The molecular basis for metastatic development remains unclear. In the present study, we used renal cell carcinoma (RCC) cells and bronchial epithelial cells, representing metastasis target organ cells, conditioned medium and co-culture models to identify specific gene expression changes responsible for cancer cell viability in a metastatic microenvironment. RCC cell proliferation and migration increased when the culture was supplemented with conditioned medium from lung fibroblasts or pleural epithelial cells. Healthy epithelial cells were, in turn, also stimulated with conditioned medium from RCC cell lines. The mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), interleukin (IL)-6, and phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) signaling pathways were identified as deregulated upon cell-cell interaction. Thus, cell-cell communication may contribute to the development of the metastatic niche. The identified deregulated signaling pathways may be considered as potential therapeutic targets in metastatic renal carcinoma.
