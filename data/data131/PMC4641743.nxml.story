Cognitive deficits have been widely observed in patients with primary brain tumors consequent to diagnosis and treatment. Given the early onset and the relatively long survival rate of patients, it seems pertinent to study and refine the techniques used to treat these deficits. The purpose of this article is to discuss cognitive deficits that follow neurosurgical treatment for low-grade gliomas as well as to outline a neuropsychological intervention to treat these deficits, specifically working memory and attention. Cognitive remediation therapy is a neuropsychological intervention that aims to enhance attention, working memory, and executive functioning, thereby diminishing the impact of these deficits on daily functioning. Computerized cognitive remediation training programs facilitate access to treatment through providing online participation. The authors include preliminary results of three participants who have completed the computerized training program as part of an ongoing study that is investigating the efficacy of this program in patients who have undergone treatment for low-grade gliomas. The results so far suggest some improvement in working memory and attention from baseline scores. It is the hope of the presentÂ authors to highlight the importance of this treatment in the continuity of care of brain tumor survivors.
