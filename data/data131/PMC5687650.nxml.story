Multiple cancers arise from sites of infection, chronic irritation, and inflammation. It has been widely accepted that pancreatic cancer is an inflammation-driven cancer. In this study, we investigated the application value of systemic inflammatory markers, neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio (NLR) and platelet to lymphocyte ratio (PLR), in the prediction of chemotherapy response and prognosis in patients with late pancreatic cancer. 122 patients with inoperable pancreatic cancers were included and separated into two groups according to median values of NLR or PLR (NLR low:<3.81 or NLR high:≥3.81, and PLR low:<142.14 or PLR high≥142.14, respectively). Baseline NLR and PLR levels were significantly higher in pancreatic cancer patients compared with the healthy subjects. Neither of the baseline NLR or PLR levels could predict outcomes. Patients with low baseline level of NLR, but not PLR, had better responses to chemotherapy. Changes in NLR, but not PLR levels, were associated with the therapeutic efficacy. Patients who stayed in or dropped into the low NLR level subgroup after first-line chemotherapy had better responses, comparing to those stayed in or jumped into the high NLR level group. No similar results could be observed when the PLR level was investigated. Therefore, NLR is a more sensitive biomarker than PLR in the prediction of chemotherapy response of patients.
