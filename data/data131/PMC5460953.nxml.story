Hypoxia-inducible factors (HIF) belong to the basic helix loop helix–PER ARNT SIM (bHLH-PAS) family of transcription factors that induce metabolic reprogramming under hypoxic condition. The phylogenetic studies of hypoxia-inducible factor-1α (HIF-1α) sequences across different organisms/species may leave a clue on the evolutionary relationships and its probable correlation to tumorigenesis and adaptation to low oxygen environments. In this study, we have aimed at the evolutionary investigation of the protein HIF-1α across different species to decipher their sequence variations/mutations and look into the probable causes and abnormal behaviour of this molecule under exotic conditions. In total, 16 homologous sequences for HIF-1α were retrieved from the National Center for Biotechnology Information. Sequence identity was performed using the Needle program. Multiple aligned sequences were used to construct the phylogeny using the neighbour-joining method. Most of the changes were observed in oxygen-dependent degradation domain and inhibitory domain. Sixteen sequences were clustered into 5 groups. The phylogenetic analysis clearly highlighted the variations that were observed at the sequence level. Comparisons of the HIF-1α sequence among cancer-prone and cancer-resistant animals enable us to find out the probable clues towards potential risk factors in the development of cancer.
