The chromosomal passenger complex (CPC) plays a pivotal role in controlling accurate chromosome segregation and cytokinesis during cell division. Aurora-B, one of the chromosomal passenger proteins, is important for the mitotic spindle assembly checkpoint (SAC). Previous reports noted that Aurora-C is predominantly expressed in male germ cells and has the same subcellular localization as Aurora-B. Increasing evidence indicates that Aurora-C is overexpressed in many somatic cancers, although its function is uncertain. Our previous study showed that the aberrant expression of Aurora-C increases the tumorigenicity of cancer cells. Here, we demonstrate that overexpressed Aurora-C displaces the centromeric localization of CPCs, including INCENP, survivin, and Aurora-B. When cells were treated with nocodazole to turn on SAC, both the Aurora-B protein stability and kinase activity were affected by overexpressed Aurora-C. As a result, the activation of spindle checkpoint protein, BubR1, and phosphorylation of histone H3 and MCAK were also eliminated in Aurora-C-overexpressing cells. Thus, our results suggest that aberrantly expressed Aurora-C in somatic cancer cells may impair SAC by displacing the centromeric localization of CPCs.
