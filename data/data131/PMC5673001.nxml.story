Distal chromosome 22q11.2 microduplications are associated with a wide range of phenotypes and unclear pathogenicity. The authors report on a 3-year-old girl with global developmental delay harboring a de novo 1.24 Mb distal chromosome 22q11.2 microduplication and a paternally inherited 0.25 Mb chromosome 4p14 microduplication. The authors review clinical features of 30 reported cases of distal 22q11.2 duplications. Common features include developmental delay (93%), neuropsychiatric features (26%), and nonspecific facial dysmorphisms (74%). In 70% of cases, the distal 22q11.2 duplications were inherited, and the majority of the carrier parents were phenotypically normal. Furthermore, 30% of probands carried an additional copy number variant. Review of the phenotype in individuals carrying microduplications involving similar low copy repeats (LCR) failed to establish any clear genotype–phenotype correlations. Distal 22q11.2 duplications represent a major challenge for genetic counseling and prediction of clinical consequences. Our report suggests a pathogenic role of distal 22q11.2 duplications and supports a “multiple hit” hypothesis underlying its variable expressivity and phenotypic severity.
