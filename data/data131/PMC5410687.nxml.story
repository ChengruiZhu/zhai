A patient of 58 years of age without medical problems came to the clinic due to missing teeth in the upper posterior region and to change the partial fixed prosthesis in the upper anterior area. Proposed treatment: surgical phase of three conical shape tapering implants with prosthetic platform in occlusal direction with mechanize collar tissue level with fixtures to place implant-supported metal-ceramic restorations. In the anterior area, a zirconium oxide fixed partial prosthesis was vertical preparation of the toothâ€™s. When preparing teeth to receive fixed prostheses, the definition and shape of finish lines has been a subject of endless discussion, modification, and change ever since the beginnings of restorative prosthetic dentistry. The BOPT technique (biologically oriented preparation technique) was first described in the context of tooth-supported restorations but has recently been applied to dental implants with the aim of ensuring healthy peri-implant tissue and creating the possibility of modeling the peri-implant sulcus by modifying prosthetic emergence profiles. Vertical preparation of teeth and abutments without finish line on implants is a technique which was found to be adequate for ensuring the remodeling and stability of peri-implant tissues.
