The system that resulted through the iterative design process includes (1) NODA smartCapture, a mobile phone-based application for parents to record prescribed video evidence at home; and (2) NODA Connect, a Web portal for diagnosticians to direct in-home video collection, access developmental history, and conduct an assessment by linking evidence of behaviors tagged in the videos to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders criteria. Applying clinical judgment, the diagnostician concludes a diagnostic outcome. During field evaluation, without prior training, parents easily (average rating of 4 on a 5-point scale) used the system to record video evidence. Across all in-home video evidence recorded during field evaluation, 96% (26/27) were judged as clinically useful, for performing an autism diagnosis. For 4 children (3 with autism and 1 typically developing), both diagnosticians independently arrived at the correct diagnostic status (autism versus typical). Overall, in 91% of assessments (10/11) via NODA Connect, diagnosticians confidently (average rating 4.5 on a 5-point scale) concluded a diagnostic outcome that matched with the childâ€™s previous diagnostic status.
