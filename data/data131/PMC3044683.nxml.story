Genes are templates for proteins, yet evolutionary studies of genes and proteins often bear little resemblance. Analyses of gene evolution typically treat each codon independently, quantifying gene evolution by summing over the constituent codons. In contrast, studies of protein evolution generally incorporate protein structure and interactions between amino acids explicitly. We investigate correlations in the evolution of codons as a function of their distance from each other along the protein coding sequence. This approach is motivated by the expectation that codons near each other in sequence often encode amino acids belonging to the same functional unit. Consequently, these amino acids are more likely to interact and/or experience similar selective regimes, introducing correlation between the evolution of the underlying codons. We find codon evolution in Drosophilids to be correlated over a characteristic length scale of â‰ˆ10 codons. Specifically, the presence of a non-synonymous substitution substantially increases the probability of further such substitutions nearby, particularly within that lineage. Further analysis suggests both functional interactions between amino acids and correlation in the strength of selection contribute to this effect. These findings are relevant for understanding the relative importance of different modes of selection, and particularly the role of epistasis, in gene and protein evolution.
