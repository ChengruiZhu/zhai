When we hear a sound, we can describe its location relative to ourselves (e.g., “the phone is on my right”) or relative to the world (e.g., “the phone is in the corner”). These descriptions of space are known as egocentric and allocentric, respectively, and illustrate the representation of sound location in reference frames defined either by the observer or the world. We know that neurons in the brain can represent the location of a sound source. However, previous experiments have been performed in static subjects, in which it’s not possible to tell whether spatial tuning reflects sensitivity to the position of the sound relative to the head or in the world. Here, we recorded neurons in the auditory cortex of freely moving ferrets and showed that most cells represent the position of a sound relative to the head, i.e., in an egocentric reference frame. We also recorded a smaller number of allocentric cells that were tuned to the position of a sound in the world, across the movement of the subject. By recording in freely moving animals, we were also able to investigate the neural encoding of sound source distance and the modulation of auditory processing by head movement speed.
