The immunochemical specificity of the combining sites of murine myeloma protein CAL20 TEPC1035 was studied by quantitative precipitin and precipitin inhibition assays. Myeloma protein CAL20 TEPC1035 precipitated with only three dextrans, B1355S4, B1498S, and B1501S, with high proportions of alpha(1 leads to 3) linkages, but not with any other dextrans, glycogen, and pullulan. Inhibition tests with various sugars show that the combining site of myeloma protein CAL20 TEPC1035 is most complementary to panose, a trisaccharide DGlc alpha(1 leads to 6)DGlc alpha(1 leads to 4)DGlc. Panose was 3.3 times more potent than a tetrasaccharide DGlc alpha(1 leads to 6)DGlc alpha(1 leads to 4)DGlc alpha(1 leads to 4)DGlc and 8, 23, 42, > 42 times more active than maltose, nigerose, isomaltose, and kojibiose, respectively. These findings were paralleled by their binding properties as determined by affinity electrophoresis. The association constants (Ka) of these three dextrans to myeloma protein CAL20 TEPC1035 ranged from 3.8 X 10(3) ml/g to 5.02 X 10(3) ml/g. The association constant of inhibitor (Kia) of panose was 8.19 X 10(3) M-1. Myeloma protein CAL20 TEPC1035 is an antidextran with specificity different from those of other murine myeloma antidextrans and from human antidextrans reported previously and its combining site size is at least as large as a trisaccharide. The binding constant of methyl alpha-D-glucoside (7.2 X 10(2)) was 73% of that of panose and comparable to that of myeloma protein W3129 (9.4 X 10(2)) with a cavity-type site and 600 times lower (1.6 X 10(0)) for QUPC52 with a groove type site, indicating that the terminal nonreducing residue is held in a cavity. Inhibition data with various alpha(1 leads to 4)-linked oligosaccharides also indicate that the internal portions of these inhibitors may react directly with a portion of the combining site. These findings suggest that myeloma antidextran CAL20 TEPC1035 has a partial cavity-type combining site in which the terminal nonreducing dGlc alpha(1 leads to 6) moiety is held in a cavity with the other two sugars forming a groove. However, oligosaccharides with one or more alternating [leads to 3DGlc alpha(1 leads to 6)DGlc alpha(1 leads to 3)DGlcl leads to] units with and without terminal nonreducing DGlc alpha(1 leads to 6) or DGLc alpha(1 leads to 3) side chains remain to be tested to determine whether structures known to be present in the three dextrans which precipitate CAL20 TEPC1035 may not prove to be more active than panose.
