Neurons are polarized cells that rely on bidirectional transport to deliver thousands of cargos between the cell body and the most distal ends of their axons. One cargo that is of particular importance is the NAD-synthesising enzyme Nmnat2. This surprisingly unstable protein is produced in the cell body and its constant supply into axons is required to keep them alive. If this supply is interrupted, Nmnat2 levels in the distal axon drop below a critical threshold, leading to axon degeneration. The rapid turnover of Nmnat2 contributes critically to the time course of axon degeneration. If its half-life could be extended, axons may be able to survive transient interruptions of its supply. In this study, we find that disruption of Nmnat2 localization to axonal transport vesicles increases both its half-life and its capacity to protect injured neurites. Specifically, association of Nmnat2 with transport vesicles reduces it stability by making it vulnerable to ubiquitination and proteasome-mediated degradation. These findings suggest that modulation of the subcellular localization of Nmnat2 on transport vesicles could serve as a potential avenue for therapeutic treatment of axon degeneration.
