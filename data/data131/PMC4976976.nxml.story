Synthesis of the translation machinery, including the mega-Dalton, RNA-protein ribosome complex, serves as a key driver of cellular growth and proliferation. It is therefore unsurprising that ribosomal biogenesis is under intricate regulation. The process through which ribosomes are made entails the coordination of components from diverse signaling pathways in both normal and diseased cells. Both oncogenes and tumor suppressors can influence this orchestration by impinging upon the rate-determining steps of RNA Polymerase I-mediated transcription of ribosomal RNA (rRNA) and the coupled process of ribosome assembly. In this study we investigated whether the secreted protein Wnt5a, an antagonist of mammary tumor growth, regulates rRNA synthesis in breast cancer cells. We find that the induction of Wnt5a signaling disturbs assembly of the RNA polymerase I machinery, leading to a repressive rDNA chromatin state that is not amenable to active rRNA gene transcription. Wnt5a signaling represses rRNA synthesis by stimulating nucleolar accumulation of Dishevelled1 (DVL1), a downstream effector of Wnt5a signaling, while having no such effect on DVL2 or DVL3. Wnt5a-induced accumulation of DVL1 in the nucleolus directly interferes with the synthesis of rRNA, suggesting that a tumor suppressive effect of Wnt5a in breast cancer cells is mediated by DVL1-dependent repression of rRNA synthesis.
