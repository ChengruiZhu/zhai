Kinetochores regulate the dynamics of attached microtubule bundles (kinetochore-fibres, K-fibres) to generate the forces necessary for chromosome movements in mitosis. Current models suggest that poleward-moving kinetochores are attached to depolymerising K-fibres and anti-poleward-moving kinetochores to polymerising K-fibres. How the dynamics of individual microtubules within the K-fibre relate to poleward and anti-poleward movements is poorly understood. To investigate this, we developed a live-cell imaging assay combined with computational image analysis that allows eGFP-tagged EB3 (also known as MAPRE3) to be quantified at thousands of individual metaphase kinetochores as they undergo poleward and anti-poleward motion. Surprisingly, we found that K-fibres are incoherent, containing both polymerising and depolymerising microtubules â€“ with a small polymerisation bias for anti-poleward-moving kinetochores. K-fibres also display bursts of EB3 intensity, predominantly on anti-poleward-moving kinetochores, equivalent to more coherent polymerisation, and this was associated with more regular oscillations. The frequency of bursts and the polymerisation bias decreased upon loss of kinesin-13, whereas loss of kinesin-8 elevated polymerisation bias. Thus, kinetochores actively set the balance of microtubule polymerisation dynamics in the K-fibre while remaining largely robust to fluctuations in microtubule polymerisation.
