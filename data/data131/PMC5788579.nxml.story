Aging significantly affects the cardiac muscle (CM) and skeletal muscles (SM). Since the aging process of CM and SM may be different, high throughput RNA sequencing was performed using CM and SM in different age conditions to evaluate the expression profiles of messenger RNA (mRNA), long non-coding RNA (lncRNA), micro RNA (miRNA), and circular (circRNA). Several mRNAs, lncRNAs, and miRNAs were highly expressed and consistently appeared in both ages in one of the two muscle tissues. Gene ontology (GO) annotation described that these genes were required for maintaining normal biological functions of CM and SM tissues. Furthermore, 26 mRNAs, 4 lncRNAs, 22 miRNAs, and 26 circRNAs were differentially expressed during cardiac muscle aging. Moreover, 81 mRNAs, 5 lncRNAs, 79 miRNAs, and 62 circRNAs were differentially expressed during aging of skeletal muscle. When comparing the expression profiles of CM and SM during aging, the senescence process in CM and SM was found to be fundamentally different. In addition, we assessed multi-group cooperative control relationships and constructed circRNA-miRNA-mRNA co-expression networks in muscular aging. In conclusion, our findings will contribute to the understanding of muscular aging and provide a foundation for future studies on the molecular mechanisms underlying muscular aging.
