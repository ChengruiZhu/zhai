Robustness of a network is defined by how consistently it performs upon removal of some of its components. It is a common strategy for plant pathogens to attack components of the plant immune signaling network in an attempt to dampen plant immunity. Therefore, it is crucial for the plant immune signaling network to have a high level of robustness. We previously reported that the robustness level of the plant immune signaling network is higher during Effector-Triggered Immunity (ETI) than Pattern-Triggered Immunity (PTI). Here we discovered a molecular switch that determines two robustness levels during ETI and PTI. Salicylic acid (SA) is a major plant immune signal molecule that regulates many immune-related genes. SA-independent alternative mechanisms also regulated the majority of SA-responsive genes during ETI but not PTI. One of the SA-independent mechanisms was mediated by prolonged activation of MAP kinases (MAPKs). MAPK activation was prolonged during ETI but transient during PTI. Thus, the duration of MAPK activation switches the robustness level of the plant immune signaling network. Our findings imply that the robustness level of a biological network can be modulated by activities of its components.
