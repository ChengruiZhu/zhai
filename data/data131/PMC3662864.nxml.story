The vast collection of biomedical literature and its continued expansion has presented a number of challenges to researchers who require structured findings to stay abreast of and analyze molecular mechanisms relevant to their domain of interest. By structuring literature content into topic-specific machine-readable databases, the aggregate data from multiple articles can be used to infer trends that can be compared and contrasted with similar findings from topic-independent resources. Our study presents a generalized procedure for semi-automatically creating a custom topic-specific molecular interaction database through the use of text mining to assist manual curation. We apply the procedure to capture molecular events that underlie ‘pain’, a complex phenomenon with a large societal burden and unmet medical need. We describe how existing text mining solutions are used to build a pain-specific corpus, extract molecular events from it, add context to the extracted events and assess their relevance. The pain-specific corpus contains 765 692 documents from Medline and PubMed Central, from which we extracted 356 499 unique normalized molecular events, with 261 438 single protein events and 93 271 molecular interactions supplied by BioContext. Event chains are annotated with negation, speculation, anatomy, Gene Ontology terms, mutations, pain and disease relevance, which collectively provide detailed insight into how that event chain is associated with pain. The extracted relations are visualized in a wiki platform (wiki-pain.org) that enables efficient manual curation and exploration of the molecular mechanisms that underlie pain. Curation of 1500 grouped event chains ranked by pain relevance revealed 613 accurately extracted unique molecular interactions that in the future can be used to study the underlying mechanisms involved in pain. Our approach demonstrates that combining existing text mining tools with domain-specific terms and wiki-based visualization can facilitate rapid curation of molecular interactions to create a custom database.
