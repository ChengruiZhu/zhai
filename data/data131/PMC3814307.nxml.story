Complex organisms depend on populations of non-dividing quiescent cells for their controlled growth, development and tissue renewal. These quiescent cells are maintained in a resting state, and divide only when stimulated to do so. Unscheduled exit or failure to enter this quiescent state results in uncontrolled proliferation and cancer. Yeast cells also enter a stable, protected and reversible quiescent state. As with higher cells, they exit the cell cycle from G1, reduce growth, conserve and recycle cellular contents. These similarities, and the fact that the mechanisms that start and stop the cell cycle are fundamentally conserved lead us to think that understanding how yeast enter, maintain and reverse quiescence could give important leads into the same processes in complex organisms. We show that yeast cells maintain G1 arrest by expressing a transcription factor that represses conserved activators (cyclins) and hundreds of other genes that are important for cell division and cell growth. Failure to repress some or all of these targets leads to extra cell divisions, prevents reversible arrest and shortens life span. Many Xbp1 targets are conserved cell cycle regulators and may also be actively repressed in the quiescent cells of more complex organisms.
