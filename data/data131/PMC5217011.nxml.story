Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is critical for carcinoma invasiveness and metastasis. To investigate the role of membrane-type-2 matrix metalloproteinase (MT2-MMP) in EMT, we generated lentiviral constructs of wild-type (WT) and an inactive Glu260Ala (E260A) mutant MT2-MMP and derived stably transfected HCT116 and A549 cell lines. WT-transfected cells appeared mesenchymal-like, whereas cells transfected with the E260A mutant were epithelial-like, as were cells treated with an MMP inhibitor (GM6001). Expression of E-cadherin, Î²-catenin, and zonula occludens-1 was lower in cells transfected with WT MT2-MMP compared to vector controls, cells treated with GM6001, or cells transfected with the E260A mutant. An 80-kD N-terminal fragment of E-cadherin was immunoprecipitated in conditioned medium from WT MT2-MMP cells, but not in the medium from vector controls, cells treated with GM6001, or E260A mutant cells. When endogenous expression of MT2-MMP in A2780 human ovarian cancer cells was inhibited using GM6001 or MT2-MMP-specific siRNA, levels of the 80-kD E-cadherin fragment in conditioned medium were decreased. Chick embryo chorioallantoic membrane invasion assays demonstrated that cells transfected with WT MT2-MMP were more invasive than cells transfected with control vector, treated with GM6001, or transfected with the E260A mutant. These results suggest that MT2-MMP degrades adherens and tight junction proteins and results in EMT, making it a potential mediator of EMT in carcinomas.
