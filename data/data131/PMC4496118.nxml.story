 studies. In this system aortic rings embedded in biomatrix gels and cultured under chemically defined conditions generate arborizing vascular outgrowths which can be stimulated or inhibited with angiogenic regulators. Originally based on the rat aorta, the aortic ring model was later adapted to the mouse for the evaluation of specific molecular alterations in genetically modified animals. Viral transduction of the aortic rings has enabled investigators to overexpress genes of interest in the aortic cultures. Experiments on angiogenic mechanisms have demonstrated that formation of neovessels in aortic cultures is regulated by macrophages, pericytes and fibroblasts through a complex molecular cascade involving growth factors, inflammatory cytokines, axonal guidance cues, extracellular matrix (ECM) molecules and matrix-degrading proteolytic enzymes. These studies have shown that endothelial sprouting can be effectively blocked by depleting the aortic explants of macrophages or by interfering with the angiogenic cascade at multiple levels including growth factor signalling, cell adhesion and proteolytic degradation of the ECM. In this paper, we review the literature in this field and retrace the journey from our first morphological descriptions of the aortic outgrowths to the latest breakthroughs in the cellular and molecular regulation of aortic vessel growth and regression.
