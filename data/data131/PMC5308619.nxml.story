Parkinson's disease (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative disorder, but there are few treatments currently available. The autophagy pathway plays an important role in the pathogenesis of PD; modulating this pathway is considered to be a promising treatment strategy. Piperine (PIP) is a Chinese medicine with anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects. The present study investigated the neuroprotective effects of PIP on rotenone-induced neurotoxicity in SK-N-SH cells, primary rat cortical neurons, and in a mouse model. Mice were administered rotenone (10mg/kg) for 6 weeks; PIP (25mg/kg, 50mg/kg) was subsequently administered for 4 weeks. We found that PIP treatment attenuated rotenone-induced motor deficits, and rescued the loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra. PIP increased cell viability and restored mitochondrial functioning in SK-N-SH cells and primary neurons. In addition, PIP induced autophagy by inhibiting mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1(mTORC1) via activation of protein phosphotase 2A (PP2A). However, inhibiting PP2A activity with okadaic acid reduced these protective effects, suggesting that PP2A is a target of PIP. These findings demonstrate that PIP exerts neuroprotective effects in PD models via induction of autophagy, and may be an effective agent for PD treatment.
