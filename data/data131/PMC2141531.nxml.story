). These data are taken to indicate that luteal secretions give partial protection against destruction to the hormones. 7. The observation that in certain of the urine extracts the hormone titer by bioassay is somewhat higher than the colorimetric titer may indicate that there is a slight conversion of estrone to estradiol, particularly since no equilenin was found in any of the extracts by colorimetric test. 8. The simultaneous injection of 300 micrograms of estrone and 500 micrograms of progesterone 4 days after an initial injection of 300 micrograms of estrone results in: (1) an increased estrin excretion in females in heat, hysterectomized unmated, and ovariectomized, and a slight decrease in the pseudopregnant female; (2) the appearance of estriol in the urine of the long time ovariectomized animal with no urinary estriol in a control ovariectomized animal receiving no progesterone. These findings are taken to prove that the conversion of estrone to estriol occurs in the uterus under the influence of progesterone. Since animals in heat produce small amounts of estriol after estrone injection it is inferred that the ovaries of estrus rabbits produce small amounts of corpus luteum hormone in the absence of formed corpora lutea.
