 their common receptor, guanylyl cyclase (GC)-A (also called natriuretic peptide receptor (NPR)-A). Mice deficient for GC-A are mildly hypertensive and show marked cardiac hypertrophy and fibrosis that is disproportionately severe, given their modestly higher blood pressure. Indeed, the cardiac hypertrophy seen in these mice is enhanced in a blood pressure-independent manner and is suppressed by cardiomyocyte-specific overexpression of GC-A. These results suggest that the actions of a local cardiac ANP/BNP-GC-A system are essential for maintenance of normal cardiac architecture. In addition, GC-A was shown to exert its cardioprotective effects by inhibiting angiotensin II-induced hypertrophic signaling, and recent evidence suggests that regulator of G protein signaling (RGS) subtype 4 is involved in the GC-A-mediated inhibition of GÎ±q-coupled hypertrophic signal transduction. Furthermore, several different groups have reported that functional mutations in the promoter region of the human GC-A gene are associated with essential hypertension and ventricular hypertrophy. These findings suggest that endogenous GC-A protects the heart from pathological hypertrophic stimuli, and that humans who express only low levels of GC-A are genetically predisposed to cardiac remodeling and hypertension.
