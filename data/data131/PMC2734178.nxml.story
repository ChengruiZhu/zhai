One of the biggest open questions in evolutionary biology is why sexual reproduction is so common despite its manifold costs. Many hypotheses have been proposed that can potentially explain the emergence and maintenance of sexual reproduction in nature, and currently the biggest challenge in the field is assessing their plausibility. Theoretical work has identified the conditions under which sexual reproduction is expected. However, these conditions were typically derived, making strongly simplifying assumptions about the relationship between organisms' genotype and fitness, known as the fitness landscape. Building onto previous theoretical work, we here propose different population properties that can be used to predict when sex will be beneficial. We then use simulations across a range of simple and complex fitness landscapes to test if such predictors generate accurate predictions of evolutionary outcomes. We find that one of the simplest predictors, related to variation of genetic distance between sequences, is also the most accurate one across our simulations. However, stochastic effects occurring in small populations compromise the accuracy of all predictors. Our study both illustrates the limitations of various predictors and suggests directions in which to search for new, experimentally attainable predictors.
