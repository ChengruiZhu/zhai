Neuroendocrine carcinoma of the cervix is an ultra‐rare malignancy with a poor prognosis and limited treatment options. Checkpoint blockade immunotherapy has rapidly developed into an emerging standard of care for several common disease types. Interestingly, in preclinical and retrospective clinical data, radiation therapy has been demonstrated to synergize with checkpoint inhibitors. Here we report a patient with metastatic, chemotherapy‐refractory neuroendocrine carcinoma who presented with partial bowel obstruction due to a large tumor burden. Genomic analysis demonstrated a high number of alterations on liquid biopsy (circulating tumor DNA [ctDNA]), which prompted treatment with stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) combined with anti‐programmed cell death protein 1 antibody. Tissue rebiopsy and comprehensive genomic profiling confirmed high tumor mutational burden and a mismatch repair gene defect. The patient manifested near‐complete systemic resolution of disease, ongoing at 10+ months. We discuss the novel treatment modality of SBRT combined with a checkpoint inhibitor and the implications of molecular profiling and tumor mutational burden as potential predictors of response.
