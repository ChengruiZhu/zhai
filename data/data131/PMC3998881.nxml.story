In drug discovery, the goal is to identify new compounds to alter the behavior of a protein implicated in disease. With the very large number of small molecules to test, researchers have increasingly studied fragments (compounds with a small number of atoms) because there are fewer possibilities to evaluate and they can be used to identify larger compounds. Computational tools can efficiently assess if a fragment will bind a protein target of interest. Given the large number of structures available for protein-small molecule complexes, we present in this study a data-driven computational method for fragment binding prediction called FragFEATURE. FragFEATURE predicts fragments preferred by a protein structure using a knowledge base of all previously observed protein-fragment interactions. Comparison to previous observations enables it to determine if a query structure is likely to bind particular fragments. For numerous protein structures bound to small molecules, FragFEATURE predicted fragments matching the bound entity. For multiple proteins, it also predicted fragments matching drugs known to inhibit the proteins. These fragments can therefore lead us to promising drug-like compounds to study further using computational tools or experimental resources.
