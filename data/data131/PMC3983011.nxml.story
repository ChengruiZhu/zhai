Nucleic
acid aptamers function as versatile sensing and targeting
agents for analytical, diagnostic, therapeutic, and gene-regulatory
applications, but their limited characterization and functional validation
have hindered their broader implementation. We report the development
of a surface plasmon resonance-based platform for rapid characterization
of kinetic and equilibrium binding properties of aptamers to small
molecules. Our system is label-free and scalable and enables analysis
of different aptamerâ€“target pairs and binding conditions with
the same platform. This method demonstrates improved sensitivity,
flexibility, and stability compared to other aptamer characterization
methods. We validated our assay against previously reported aptamer
affinity and kinetic measurements and further characterized a diverse
panel of 12 small molecule-binding RNA and DNA aptamers. We report
the first kinetic characterization for six of these aptamers and affinity
characterization of two others. This work is the first example of
direct comparison of in vitro selected and natural aptamers using
consistent characterization conditions, thus providing insight into
the influence of environmental conditions on aptamer binding kinetics
and affinities, indicating different possible regulatory strategies
used by natural aptamers, and identifying potential in vitro selection
strategies to improve resulting binding affinities.
