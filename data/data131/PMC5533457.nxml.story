Our perception of the external world comes from our senses. Often overlooked the skin is our largest sensory organ. Specialized neurons located in the dorsal root ganglion (DRG), which innervate the body, and trigeminal ganglion (TG), which innervate the face, sense the somatosensory perceptions: light touch, temperature, pain (nociceptors) and muscle/limb position (proprioception) via nerve endings that project to the skin. These neurons receive and relay information from these diverse stimuli through distinct subclasses of neurons. Since these neurons arise from common lineages, they provide an excellent system to study how neurons develop and diversify into different subtypes. Runx transcription factors have been shown in terrestrial vertebrates (birds and mammals) to be instrumental in specifying nociceptor and proprioceptor populations by regulating the expression of a class of genes that code for the neurotrophin receptors, which are thought to be essential for specifying these neuronal fates. In our study we show that mechanisms by which Runx transcription factors regulate neurotrophin receptor expression are conserved between zebrafish and terrestrial vertebrates, yet the type of neuron specified by these genes are different such that in zebrafish the neurotrophin receptor TrkC is expressed in a nociceptor lineage instead of the proprioceptor/mechanoreceptor lineage as in terrestrial vertebrates. These data demonstrate that the specification of neuronal lineages is not fundamental to a given neurotrophin receptor but has adapted and evolved from the time fish and terrestrial vertebrates diverged 350 million years ago. Furthermore we show in fish that zebrafish Runx3 has properties that are divided between Runx1 and Runx3 in terrestrial vertebrates. Finally we show that the Runx co-factor Cbfβ is essential for its function, but the high level of Runx3 expression can overcome the loss of Cbfβ, demonstrating that Cbfβ in this context serves solely as a signal amplifier of Runx3 activity.
