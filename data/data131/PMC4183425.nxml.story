Synapses are specialized sites of cellâ€“cell contact that serve to transmit signals between neurons and their targets, most commonly other neurons. It is widely believed that changes in synaptic properties, driven by prior activity or by other physiological signals, represent a major cellular mechanism by which neuronal networks are modified. Recent experiments show that in addition to directed changes, synaptic sizes also change spontaneously, with dynamics that seem to have strong stochastic components. In spite of these dynamics, however, population distributions of synaptic sizes are remarkably stable, and scale smoothly in response to various perturbations. In this study we show that fundamental aspects of synapse size dynamics are captured remarkably well by a simple statistical model known as the Kesten process: the random-like nature of synaptic size changes; the stability and shape of synaptic size distributions; their scaling following various perturbations; and the kinetics of new synapse formation. These findings indicate that the multiple microscopic processes involved in determining synaptic size combine in such a way that their collective behavior buffers many of the underlying details. The simplicity of the model and its robustness provide a new route for understanding the emergence of invariants at the level of the synaptic population.
