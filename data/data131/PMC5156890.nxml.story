Generally, lesions of rectal neuroendocrine tumors (NETs) 10 mm or smaller are less malignant and are indicated for endoscopic therapy. However, the vertical margin may remain positive after conventional endoscopic mucosal resection (EMR) because NETs develop in a way similar to submucosal tumors (SMTs). The usefulness of EMR with a ligation device, which is modified EMR, and endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD) was reported, but no standard treatment has been established. We encountered 2 patients in whom rectal NETs were completely resected by combined dissection and resection of the circular muscle layer using the ESD technique. Case 1 was an 8-mm NET of the lower rectum. Case 2 was NET of the lower rectum treated with additional resection for a positive vertical margin after EMR. In both cases, the circular muscle layer was dissected applying the conventional ESD technique, followed by en bloc resection while conserving the longitudinal muscle layer. No problems occurred in the postoperative course in either case. Rectal NETs are observed in the lower rectum in many cases, and it is less likely that intestinal perforation by endoscopic therapy causes peritonitis. The method employed in these cases, namely combined dissection and resection of the circular muscle layer using the ESD technique, can be performed relatively safely, and it is possible to ensure negativity of the vertical margin. In addition, it may also be useful for additional treatment of cases with a positive vertical margin after EMR.
