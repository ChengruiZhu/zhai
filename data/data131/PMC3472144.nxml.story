It has been demonstrated that the type of diet affects the brain structure and function. Consumption of fat-rich food is one of the most important factors that lead to increase in the prevalence of cardiovascular and neurological diseases. High-fat diet may change the volume and neuronal number or density in the hypothalamus, which is the center of energy control. Therefore, this study was designed to study the effect of high-fat diet on the density and number of neurons, and also the volume of hypothalamus in adult male mice. Forty male mice were divided into the control and experimental groups. The control group were fed with standard and the experimental groups, with high-fat diet for 4 (short-term) or 8 (long-term) weeks. The animals were perfused and brains were immediately removed, post-fixed and cut coronally and serially using cryostat at 30-Âµm thickness. Every 6th sections were stained by cresyl violet. The numerical density and number of neuron and the volume of hypothalamus were estimated by using unbiased stereological methods. Data analysis showed that both short and long time consumption of high-fat diet decreased the neuronal cell density of the hypothalamus. Interestingly, despite a decrease in the neuronal cell density, long time consumption of high-fat diet could significantly increase the volume of hypothalamus (
