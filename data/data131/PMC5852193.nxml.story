] system, coupled with SBD-targeted mutagenesis, to investigate how allosteric changes within key structural regions of the Hsp70 SBD result in functional changes in the protein that translate to phenotypic defects in prion propagation and ability to grow at elevated temperatures. We find that variants mutated within the β6 and β7 region of the SBD are defective in prion propagation and heat-shock phenotypes, due to conformational changes within the SBD. Structural analysis of the mutants identifies a potential NBD:SBD interface and key residues that may play important roles in signal transduction between domains. As a consequence of disrupting the β6/β7 region and the SBD overall, Hsp70 exhibits a variety of functional changes including dysregulation of ATPase activity, reduction in ability to refold proteins and changes to interaction affinity with specific co-chaperones and protein substrates. Our findings relate specific structural changes in Hsp70 to specific changes in functional properties that underpin important phenotypic changes in vivo. A thorough understanding of the molecular mechanisms of Hsp70 regulation and how specific modifications result in phenotypic change is essential for the development of new drugs targeting Hsp70 for therapeutic purposes.
