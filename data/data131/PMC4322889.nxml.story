 (Scheff.) Boerl (Thymelaceae). This bioactive fraction is a potential treatment for dysmenorrhea and endometriosis. The present study investigated the pharmacological action of DLBS1442 in endometrial cells. The effect of various doses of DLBS1442 (0–200 μg/mL) over 24 hours was studied using the human endometrial RL95-2 cell line to observe its effect on angiogenesis, cell migration, estrogen and progesterone receptor levels, the eicosanoid pathway, cell viability, and apoptosis. The impact of DLBS1442 on nuclear factor kappa B (NFκB) and the eicosanoid pathway was also studied through its marker gene expression using a quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction method. DLBS1442 showed an ability to inhibit angiogenesis and cell migration in a dose-dependent manner. At a dose of 100 μg/mL, DLBS1442 increased the cell population in sub-G1 phase from 7% to 34%. DLBS1442 also significantly downregulated the estrogen receptor level and upregulated the progesterone receptor level. Further, it inhibited the eicosanoid signaling pathway by reducing the NFκB transcription level and subsequent reduction of inducible nitric oxide synthase. A dose-dependent decrease in viability and increased apoptosis in RL95-2 cells were also evident after exposure to DLBS1442, where the IC
