Brain glioma therapy is an important challenge in oncology. Here, doxorubicin (DOX) and paclitaxel (PTX)-loaded cyclic arginine-glycine-aspartic acid peptide (c(RGDyK))-decorated Pluronic micelles (cyclic arginine-glycine-aspartic acid peptide-decorated Pluronic micelles loaded with doxorubicin and paclitaxel [RGD-PF-DP]) were designed as a potential targeted delivery system to enhance blood–brain barrier penetration and improve drug accumulation via integrin-mediated transcytosis/endocytosis and based on integrin overexpression in blood–brain barrier and glioma cells. The physicochemical characterization of RGD-PF-DP revealed a satisfactory size of 28.5±0.12 nm with uniform distribution and core-shell structure. The transport rates across the in vitro blood–brain barrier model, cellular uptake, cytotoxicity, and apoptosis of U87 malignant glioblastoma cells of RGD-PF-DP were significantly greater than those of non-c(RGDyK)-decorated Pluronic micelles. In vivo fluorescence imaging demonstrated the specificity and efficacy of intracranial tumor accumulation of RGD-PF-DP. RGD-PF-DP displayed an extended median survival time of 39 days, with no serious body weight loss during the regimen. No acute toxicity to major organs was observed in mice receiving treatment doses via intravenous administration. In conclusion, RGD-PF-DP could be a promising vehicle for enhanced doxorubicin and paclitaxel delivery in patients with brain glioma.
