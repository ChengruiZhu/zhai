Patients with pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDA) typically succumb to mortality early, even following surgical resection. Therefore, prognostic factors associated with early mortality are required to improve the survival of patients with PDA following surgical resection. Carbohydrate sulfotransferase 15 (CHST15) is responsible for the biosynthesis of sulfated chondroitin sulfate E (CS-E), which serves a pivotal function in cancer progression by cleaving CD44. CHST15 and CD44 expression in PDA tissue were assessed as a prognostic factor in patients with PDA following surgical resection. A total of 36 consecutive patients with PDA were enrolled following surgical resection between January 2008 and December 2014. The intensities of CHST15 and CD44 expression were analyzed by immunohistochemical staining. The recurrence period was significantly earlier in the strong CHST15 expression group compared with the negative-to-moderate CHST15 expression group. Overall survival (OS) was also significantly decreased in the strong CHST15 expression group compared with the negative-to-moderate CHST15 expression group. Multivariate analysis also indicated significant associations between CHST15 overexpression and disease-free survival (DFS) and OS. However, expression of CD44 in PDA tissue was not associated with DFS or OS. The present study has demonstrated for the first time that high CHST15 expression in PDA tissue may represent a potential predictive marker of DFS and OS in patients with PDA following surgical resection.
