The aim of this study was to evaluate prognostic effect of the angiogenesis regulators VEGF-R1, VEGF-R2 and VEGF-A for recurrent disease and disease-free survival (DFS), and their relation to the apoptosis regulator p53, in 131 patients with FIGO-stages Iâ€“II with epithelial ovarian cancer. For the detection of positivity of the markers the techniques of tissue microarrays and immunohistochemistry (IHC) were used. In tumors the frequency of positive staining for VEGF-R1 was 19%, for VEGF-R2 and VEGF-A, it was 77 and 70%, respectively. Positivity for p53 was detected in 25% of tumors. The total number of recurrences in the complete series was 34 out of 131 (26%) and 5-year disease-free survival (DFS) was 68%. Positive staining for VEGF-A (P=0.030), VEGF-R2 (P=0.011) and p53 (P=0.015) was found more frequently in type II tumors than in type I tumors. Patients with VEGF-R1 negative tumors had worse (P=0.021) DFS compared to patients with VEGF-R1 positive tumors. In two multivariate Cox analyzes with DFS as endpoint, FIGO-stage (HR=3.8), VEGF-R2 status (HR=0.4) and p53 status (HR=2.3), all were significant and independent prognostic factors. When the variables VEGF-R2 and p53 were replaced with the new variable VEGF-R2
