Our visual system keeps pace with a rapidly changing stream of information as we view the natural world. To do so, it uses a strongly regulated system of attentional filters to constrain which visual stimuli are permitted to be fully processed to the level of conscious awareness. This article explores what happens when these filters are opened and closed in response to important visual stimuli. To understand these dynamics, our neural network model provides simulations of the role played by attention. These simulations can be tested by recording neural data in the form of ‘brain waves’ (EEG) and comparing the resultant signals to the output of the model. The data discussed here confirm a prediction of the model, which suggests that after the attentional filter has opened to allow one visual stimulus in, there is increased temporal variability or ‘jitter’ in the subsequent opening of the filter within an interval of about one-half of a second. These results have implications for the way our brains process multiple important stimuli perceived in rapid succession, such as the sequence of events that might occur at a critical moment in an airline cockpit or during an automobile accident.
