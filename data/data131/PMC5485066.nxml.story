Secukinumab is a human monoclonal antibody with demonstrated efficacy for moderate to severe psoriasis; it binds to and neutralizes interleukin (IL)‐17A. The pharmacokinetic (PK) parameters of secukinumab were best described by a 2‐compartment model. Only weight was included in the final model, as other covariates did not affect clinical relevance. The estimated serum clearance of secukinumab was 0.19 L/day, with interindividual variability (IIV) of 32% coefficient of variation (CV), and low total volume of distribution (central compartment volume, 3.61 L with IIV of 30% CV; peripheral compartment volume, 2.87 L with IIV of 18% CV). The bioavailability of secukinumab after subcutaneous dosing was approximately 73%, with an absorption rate of 0.18/day with IIV of 35% CV. The PK profile of secukinumab was linear, with no evidence of a dose dependence of clearance. Clearance and volume of secukinumab varied with body weight in an allometric relationship. The time to maximum serum concentration at steady state occurred approximately 6 days after dosing for both secukinumab 300 mg and secukinumab 150 mg. Overall, the PK properties of secukinumab were typical of a 150‐kDa human IgG1 antibody interacting with a soluble target.
