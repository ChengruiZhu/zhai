Ischemic limb diseases are induced by different obstructions of peripheral arteries. These obstructions result in insufficient nutrient and oxygen supplies to the extremities, thereby leading to severe tissue damage that is in turn related to severe morbidities and mortalities. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have been isolated from various sources. These cells are multipotent with respect to differentiation and are also characterized by migration, immune suppression, and secretion of paracrine factors. Mesenchymal stem cells have been proposed to have therapeutic potential for the treatment of ischemic limb diseases. In preclinical experiments, injection of single MSCs has been shown to increase angiogenesis and blood flow in ischemic hindlimb animal models; several molecular mechanisms of angiogenesis have also been elucidated. Furthermore, modified strategies have been developed for enhancing angiogenesis and the efficacy of MSCs. These strategies have demonstrated significant effects in pre-clinical studies. In clinical trials, MSCs have shown significant effects in the treatment of ischemic limb diseases. In this review, we focus on the therapeutic properties of human MSCs and the modified methods for enhancing angiogenesis in pre-clinical experiments. We also discuss the clinical applications of MSCs for treating limb ischemia.
