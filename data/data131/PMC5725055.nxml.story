Epidemiologic studies have shown alcohol plays a pivotal role in the development of osteonecrosis of the femoral head (ONFH). The aim of this study was to explore the underlying mechanism of alcohol-induced ONFH and the protective effect of pifithrin-α (PFTα). In vitro, we found ethanol treatment significantly activated p53, suppressed Wnt/β-catenin signaling and inhibited osteogenic-related proteins. Furthermore, by separating the cytoplasmic and nuclear proteins, we found ethanol inhibited osteogenesis by impairing the accumulation of β-catenin in both the cytoplasm and nucleus in human bone mesenchymal stem cells (hBMSCs), which resulted from activating glycogen synthase kinase-3β (GSK-3β). Therefore, PFTα, a p53 inhibitor, was introduced in this study to block the ethanol-triggered activation of p53 in hBMSCs and alcohol-induced ONFH in a rat model. In vivo, we established alcohol-induced ONFH in rats and investigated the protective effect of PFTα. Hematoxylin & eosin (H&E) staining combined with TdT-mediated dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL), cleaved caspase-3 immunohistochemical staining, and micro-CT images revealed substantial ONFH in the alcohol-administered rats, whereas significantly less osteonecrosis developed in the rats injected with PFTα. Osteogenic-related proteins, including osteocalcin, osteopontin and collagen I, were significantly decreased in the alcohol-administered rats, whereas these results were reversed in the PFTα-injected rats. Fluorochrome labeling similarly showed that alcohol significantly reduced the osteogenic activity in the rat femoral head, which was blocked by the injection of PFTα. In conclusion, PFTα had an antagonistic effect against the effects of ethanol on hBMSCs and could be a clinical strategy to prevent the development of alcohol-induced ONFH.
