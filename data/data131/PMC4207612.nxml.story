Chromosomes are replicated during the cell cycle and distributed to two progeny cells on a machine called the spindle, such that each cell has one complete copy of the genome. The chromosomes are moved by attachment to the long microtubule polymers of the mitotic spindle, formed from a centrosome at each end of the spindle. Mechanisms that restrict DNA replication and centrosome duplication to once per cell cycle are critical, as defects in either event result in genetic instability and are associated with cancer. Cell cycle-dependent control of DNA replication has been extensively studied, but comparatively little is known about the regulation of centrosome duplication, particularly its restriction to once per cell cycle. Using genetics and cytology, including super-resolution imaging to detect reduplicated centrosomes, we show that cyclin-dependent kinase phosphorylation of Sfi1, a conserved component of centrosomes, prevents the occurrence of extra rounds of yeast centrosome duplication during the cell cycle. Additionally, we propose that dephosphorylation of Sfi1 by the phosphatase Cdc14 permits centrosome duplication for the next cell cycle. Our work is the first to provide a mechanism for how centrosome duplication, like DNA replication, occurs once during the cell cycle through cyclin-dependent kinase regulation.
