In classical views of how information is processed in the brain, cognitive areas are often thought to encode incoming signals by a simple summation of spikes—action potentials fired by neurons and transmitted along the nerves—elicited by different cues. It is through this summation of spikes that cognitive areas are hypothesized to combine information from different cues and build memories. We investigated whether summation is relevant during the processing of signals emitted by the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex, a brain area which is thought to control behavioral adaptation in response to feedback cues that indicate the animal’s performance during a task. We found that a mere summation of spikes emitted in response to feedback cues actually extracts significantly less information compared to a code that also takes into account the timing of the spikes. Furthermore, we discovered that this temporal structure of the spike discharges predicts well the future behavior of monkeys. Overall, our findings suggest that the brain areas processing the signals emitted by the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex are sensitive to spike times and, thus, are unlikely to implement a mere approximate summation of inputs.
