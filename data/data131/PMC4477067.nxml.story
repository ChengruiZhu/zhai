Both metabolism and transport are key elements defining the bioavailability and biological activity of molecules, i.e. their adverse and therapeutic effects. Structured and high quality experimental data stored in a suitable container, such as a relational database, facilitates easy computational processing and thus allows for high quality information/knowledge to be efficiently inferred by computational analyses. Our aim was to create a freely accessible database that would provide easy access to data describing interactions between proteins involved in transport and xenobiotic metabolism and their small molecule substrates and modulators. We present Metrabase, an integrated cheminformatics and bioinformatics resource containing curated data related to human transport and metabolism of chemical compounds. Its primary content includes over 11,500 interaction records involving nearly 3,500 small molecule substrates and modulators of transport proteins and, currently to a much smaller extent, cytochrome P450 enzymes. Data was manually extracted from the published literature and supplemented with data integrated from other available resources.
