Malignant pleural mesothelioma (MPM) is a rare and aggressive tumor with a short survival time arising from the mesothelial cells of the pleura. Soluble mesothelin-related peptide (SMRP), osteopontin or EFEMP1 (Fibulin-3) are well described biomarkers for malignant mesothelioma with moderate sensitivity and specificity. In this study, we characterized the expression of glycodelin, a marker for risk pregnancy, in MPM by RNA and protein analyses and investigated its potential as a MPM biomarker. We were able to detect glycodelin in the serum of MPM patients. Compared to benign lung diseases, the serum levels were significant increased. Patients with high glycodelin serum levels revealed a worse overall survival. The glycodelin serum levels correlated with the tumor response to treatment. A comparison of SMRP and glycodelin serum measurement in a large patient cohort demonstrated that the detection of both soluble factors can increase the reliable diagnostic of MPM. Glycodelin was highly expressed in MPM tumors. Analyses of a tissue micro array indicated that the immunomodulatory form glycodelin A was expressed in MPM and correlated with the survival of the patients. Altogether, glycodelin seems to be a new potential biomarker for the aggressive malignant pleural mesothelioma.
