 oocytes are associated with constitutively active protein tyrosine kinases (PTKs) and protein tyrosine phosphatases that decrease and increase, respectively, the apparent affinity of the channels for cGMP. Here, we examine the effects of genistein, a competitive inhibitor of the ATP binding site, on PTKs. Like other PTK inhibitors (lavendustin A and erbstatin), cytoplasmic application of genistein prevents changes in the cGMP sensitivity that are attributable to tyrosine phosphorylation of the CNG channels. However, unlike these other inhibitors, genistein also slows the activation kinetics and reduces the maximal current through CNG channels at saturating cGMP. These effects occur in the absence of ATP, indicating that they do not involve inhibition of a phosphorylation event, but rather involve an allosteric effect of genistein on CNG channel gating. This could result from direct binding of genistein to the channel; however, the time course of inhibition is surprisingly slow (>30 s), raising the possibility that genistein exerts its effects indirectly. In support of this hypothesis, we find that ligands that selectively bind to PTKs without directly binding to the CNG channel can nonetheless decrease the effect of genistein. Thus, ATP and a nonhydrolyzable ATP derivative competitively inhibit the effect of genistein on the channel. Moreover, erbstatin, an inhibitor of PTKs, can noncompetitively inhibit the effect of genistein. Taken together, these results suggest that in addition to inhibiting tyrosine phosphorylation of the rod CNG channel catalyzed by PTKs, genistein triggers a noncatalytic interaction between the PTK and the channel that allosterically inhibits gating.
