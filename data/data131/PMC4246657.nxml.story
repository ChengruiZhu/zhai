The aim of the present study was to investigate the association between Toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2) expression and human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) in colorectal carcinoma by detecting the expression of IE1–72, TLR2, TLR4 and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α in colorectal carcinoma and colon adenoma samples, as well as by analyzing the mRNA levels of the proteins in colon cancer cell lines, following HCMV infection. For this study, 56 colorectal cancer and 36 colon adenoma samples were collected, and normal mucosal tissue adjacent to the tumor was used as the control. The expression of the IE1–72, TLR2, TLR4, nuclear factor (NF)-κB and TNF-α protein was detected by immunohistochemistry. Cells from the SW480 human colon carcinoma cell line were infected with HCMV. The expression of IE1–72, TLR2, TLR4, NF-κB and TNF-α mRNA was quantified at different time points prior to and following infection. The positive expression rate of IE1–72 was 44.6% (25/56) in colorectal cancer and 41.7% (15/36) in colon adenoma. These rates were significantly higher when compared with the 12.5% (7/56) observed in the normal tissues adjacent to the cancer tissues (P<0.05). The expression levels of TLR2, TLR4, NF-κB and TNF-α in colorectal cancer and adenoma were also higher than those in the control tissues. Furthermore, the expression of IE1–72 in colorectal cancer tissues was found to correlate with TLR2 and TLR4, and the correlation coefficients were 0.515 and 0.462, respectively. Following the infection of SW480 cells, the mRNA levels of TLR2 and TNF-α increased gradually from 6 h, peaked at 48 h, and then decreased gradually. No significant differences in TLR4 and NF-κB expression were identified. The results of the present study indicated that there is a specific association between HCMV and the occurrence and development of colorectal cancer, which may be facilitated by the TLR2 signaling pathway.
