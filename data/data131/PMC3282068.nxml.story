Annexins are a structurally related family of calcium and phospholipid-binding proteins that are involved in the regulation of a wide range of molecular and cellular processes. Annexin A2 is unique among the annexins in that it possesses redox sensitive cysteine(s). The ubiquitous and abundant expression of ANXA2 in cells and its reactivity with hydrogen peroxide led us to hypothesize that this protein could play a role in cellular redox regulation. Here we show that ANXA2 protein levels are induced by hydrogen peroxide. Furthermore, depletion of ANXA2 resulted in the elevation of cellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) upon oxidative stress, increased activation of the ROS-induced pro-apoptotic kinases, JNK, p38 and Akt and elevated sensitivity to ROS-mediated cellular damage/death. ANXA2-null mice showed significantly elevated protein oxidation in the liver and lung tissues compared to WT mice. ANXA2 depleted cancer cells showed enhanced cellular protein oxidationconcomitant with decreased tumor growth compared to control cancer cells andboth the oxidation of cellular proteins and tumor growth deficit werereversed by the antioxidant N-acetyl cysteine, indicating that ANXA2 plays akey role in the regulation of cellular redox during tumorigenesis.
