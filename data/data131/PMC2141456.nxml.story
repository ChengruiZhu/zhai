, although curved to it. These parallel roughly the behavior of a polarizing electrode, which is also shown. Before concluding that the cell's capacity is therefore due to polarization, a further complication of the circuit was considered. This was the effect of the protoplasmic capacity distributed along the wall between the contacts. Both logically and experimentally it was shown that a distributed capacity, as represented by its approximate T-network of resistances and capacities invariant with frequency, could give rise to changes of capacity and series resistance with frequency which simulate to some extent the cellular phenomena. Distributed capacity was therefore reduced in the cells by using shorter air-gaps between the contacts, or abolished by measuring impaled cells, in which the current flow across the protoplasm was entirely radial. These measurements showed a smaller, but still significant change of capacity and of equivalent resistance (in series with it) with frequency, somewhat less than with electrodes, and probably representing the true protoplasmic behavior. It is concluded that the cells display a certain degree of polarization capacity, possibly in parallel with a static capacity invariant with frequency. This might result from an insulating (
