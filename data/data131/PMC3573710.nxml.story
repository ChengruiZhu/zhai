The recently described IL-33 acts as a pro-inflammatory cytokine, inducing the expression of multiple responses in the target cells. Although a nuclear localization of IL-33 has been described, its exact functional relevance is presently unknown. The present study was conducted to analyze the effects of IL-33 on the TNF-α induced synthesis of the pro-inflammatory mediators IL-6, IL-8, and monocyte chemotactic protein-1 (MCP-1) and the pro-destructive molecules matrix metalloproteinase-1 (MMP-1), MMP-3, and TIMP-1 of rheumatoid arthritis synovial fibroblast (RA-SFs) using RNA overexpression and silencing. TNF-α significantly induced IL-33 mRNA expression and protein synthesis in RA-SFs. TNF-α-induced IL-33 protein expression was mediated via p38 signaling. Immunohistochemistry for IL-33 clearly showed that nuclear translocation of IL-33 was induced in TNF-α stimulated RA-SFs. IL-33 overexpression enhanced TNF-α-induced pro-inflammatory and pro-destructive functions in RA-SFs. IL-33 silencing significantly downregulated TNF-α-induced pro-inflammatory functions, whereas TNF-α-induced pro-destructive functions were less influenced by IL-33 silencing. This study identifies IL-33 as a critical regulator/enhancer of TNF-α-induced functions in RA-SFs, pointing to a central role of this cytokine in the perpetuation of pro-inflammatory and pro-destructive processes in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and other inflammatory and degenerative diseases.
