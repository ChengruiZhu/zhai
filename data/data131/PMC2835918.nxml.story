We found (a) abundant tissue TNFα and ASK1 expression throughout all layers of the intestine in neonates with NEC, suggesting that TNFα/ASK1 may be a potential source (indicators) of intestinal injury in neonates with NEC; (b) TNFα-induced rapid and transient activation of JNK/p38 apoptotic signaling in all cell lines suggests that this may be an important molecular characteristic of NEC; (c) TNFα-induced rapid and transient ROs production in RIe-1 cells indicates that mitochondria are the predominant source of ROS, demonstrated by significantly attenuated response in mitochondrial DNA-depleted (RIE-1-ρ°) intestinal epithelial cells; (d) further studies with mitochondria-targeted antioxidant PBN supported our hypothesis that effective mitochondrial ROS trapping is protective against TNFα/ROs-induced intestinal epithelial cell injury; (e) TNFα induces significant mitochondrial dysfunction in intestinal epithelial cells, resulting in increased production of mtROS, drop in mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) and decreased oxygen consumption; (f) although the significance of mitochondrial autophagy in NEC has not been unequivocally shown, our studies provide a strong preliminary indication that TNFα/ROs-induced mitochondrial autophagy may play a role in NeC, and this process is a late phenomenon.
