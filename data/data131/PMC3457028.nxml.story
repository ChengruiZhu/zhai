Calcifying fibrous tumor is a very rare benign mesenchymal tumor which shows a predilection for soft tissue, mesentery and peritoneum. Up to date only 7 cases have been reported in the literature confined to the gastric wall. We report a rare case of a calcifying fibrous tumor of the stomach in a 60-year-old man who presented with dyspepsia, flatulence and feeling weight. A clinical and laboratory investigation was performed with normal results. Gastroscopy revealed a bulge in the gastric body measuring 1 cm with normal overlying mucosa, and mucosal biopsies showed chronic gastritis. Endoscopic ultrasound of the gastric bulge showed a 1 Ã— 0.8 cm hypoechoic lesion involving the gastric wall. After the above finding a wedge resection of the stomach was performed. Microscopically the lesion consisted of well-circumscribed hypocellular hyalinized fibrosclerotic tissue with lympoplasmatic infiltrates, lymphoid aggregates and psammomatous calcifications. Lesional cells were positive for vimentin and factor XIII and negative for actin, desmin, S100p, CD117, CD34, CD31 and ALK-1. The lesion involved the muscularis propria with variable submucosal extension. Calcifying fibrous tumor has shown an excellent prognosis with recurrences being rare and showing the same morphology as the primary lesion.
