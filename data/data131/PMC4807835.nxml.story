The human immune system has evolved to protect us from infection and cancer, whilst avoiding damage to healthy tissue. If this complex system goes wrong, immune cells may cause inappropriate inflammation and damage, resulting in clinical disease. Examples include inflammatory bowel disease and autoimmune vasculitis, characterised by inflammation in the gut and blood vessels respectively. Genetic studies have identified many variants in our DNA code that predispose to such immune-mediated diseases. The majority of these variants lie outside protein-coding regions, and so how they influence disease risk remains largely unclear. Examining how genetic variants affect gene expression can help bridge this gap in our knowledge, but these effects are highly dependent on the cellular or environmental context such as tissue type or cellular activation status. We investigated the genetic control of gene expression in five white blood cell subtypes taken from patients with active inflammatory bowel disease and autoimmune vasculitis, and from healthy controls. We report the novel observation of distinct variants that only affect gene expression in patients with active inflammatory disease, and show that these effects can disappear following treatment. These findings provide new insights into the genetic basis of important immune-mediated diseases.
