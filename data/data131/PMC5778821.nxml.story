Triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) accounts for approximately 15–20% of all breast cancer cases and is usually more aggressive with a poorer clinical outcome compared with other breast cancer subtypes. Evidence of the involvement of microRNAs (miRNAs) in cancer has provided an opportunity for the development of novel effective therapeutic targets in TNBC. In the present study, the miRNA expression profiles of the human breast cancer cell line, MDA-MB-231, and MCF-7 cells, was evaluated by using miRNA microarray analysis. A total of 107 differentially expressed miRNAs (57 upregulated and 50 downregulated) were identified in MDA-MB-231 cells compared with MCF-7 cells. Five prominently dysregulated miRNAs (miR-200c-3p, miR-221-3p, miR-222-3p, miR-192-5p and miR-146a) were further confirmed by reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction. In addition, gene ontology analysis and pathway enrichment analysis revealed that the dysregulated miRNAs and predicted targets were found to be involved in the mitogen-activated protein kinase, Wnt, and transforming growth factor-β signaling pathways, which were known to contribute to TNBC progression and metastasis. Finally, miRNA gene network analyses suggested that miR-200c may serve as a crucial miRNA in breast cancer. Taken together, these findings may provide a comprehensive view of the function of aberrant miRNAs involved in TNBC, and dysregulated miRNAs hold promise as potential biomarkers and therapeutic targets for patients with TNBC.
