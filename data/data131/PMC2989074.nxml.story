The use of Souter-Strathclyde total elbow prostheses is a well-studied replacement therapy for reconstruction of the elbow, but loosening of the humeral component is still of concern at long-term follow-up. In this study we looked at the effect of humeral component size and bone mineral density with respect to the bone size, torsional stiffness and torque to failure in cadaveric bones. Fourteen cadaveric humeri were available for testing purposes and four different humeral component size categories were used. First, we calculated the bone quality using dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA). The torsional stiffness of the prosthetic humeri was measured during two mechanical tests: Firstly, the applied torque was recorded during a torsion fatigue test. The change of torsional stiffness between the tenth and last cycle was calculated. Secondly, a simple torsion test was performed and the torque to failure was recorded. No significant differences in outcome were seen between sizes of humeral components, even after correction for the bone size. Torsional stiffness and torque to failure were significantly correlated with bone mineral density and not with component size. In conclusion, bone quality seems to be a major eminent factor in the fixation of the humeral component in elbow replacement surgery.
