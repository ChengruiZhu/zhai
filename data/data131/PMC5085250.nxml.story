Advances in computing power have facilitated the development of increasingly larger dynamic models of biological processes, which usually have many unknown parameters. Often times, such models contain parameters that are structurally unidentifiable, i.e., they cannot be uniquely determined from experiments. Any parameter estimation algorithm will fail when trying to estimate unidentifiable parameters, leading to waste of resources and possibly wrong model predictions. Hence, it is essential to assess structural identifiability before exploiting a model. However, performing such analysis can be hard, especially as models become increasingly complicated. To address this challenge, we developed a methodology for structural identifiability analysis that aims at generality—it can handle any analytic model written as a set of ordinary differential equations—and computational efficiency—it includes features that facilitate the analysis of large systems. We provide an implementation of the methodology as a MATLAB toolbox called STRIKE-GOLDD. We illustrate its applicability to systems biology models of genetic, signalling, metabolic, and pharmacokinetic networks, showing which of them are unidentifiable and how they can be made identifiable.
