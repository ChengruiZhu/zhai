). Our Phospho-iTRAQ method focuses on the unmodified counterparts of phosphorylated peptides, which thus circumvents the ionization, fragmentation, and phospho-enrichment difficulties that hamper quantitation of stoichiometry in most common phosphoproteomics methods. Since iTRAQ enables multiplexing, simultaneous (phospho)proteome comparison between internal replicates and multiple samples is possible. The technique was validated on multiple instrument platforms by adding internal standards of high stoichiometry to a complex lysate of control and EGF-stimulated HeLa cells. To demonstrate the flexibility of PhosphoiTRAQ with regards to the experimental setup and data mining, the proteome coverage was extended through gel fractionation, while an internal replicate measurement creates more stringent data analysis opportunities. The latter allows other researchers to set their own threshold for selecting potential phosphorylation events in the dataset presented here, depending on the biological question or corroboration under investigation. The latest developments in MS instrumentation promise to further increase the resolution of the stoichiometric measurement of Phospho-iTRAQ in the future.
