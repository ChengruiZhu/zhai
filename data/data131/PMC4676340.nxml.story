The new drug for type 2 diabetes, the sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT-2) inhibitor, is reversible inhibitor of SGLT-2, leading to reduction of renal glucose reabsorption and decrease of plasma glucose, in an insulin-independent manner. In addition to glucose control, the management of coronary risk factors is very important for patients with diabetes. Here we reviewed published articles about the possible anti-atherosclerotic effects beyond glucose lowering of the SGLT-2 inhibitors. We searched by using Pubmed, and found 770 published articles about SGLT-2 inhibitors. Among 10 kinds of SGLT-2 inhibitors, the number of published articles about dapagliflozin was the greatest among SGLT-2 inhibitors. Since SGLT-2 inhibitors have similar chemical structures, we concentrated on the published articles about dapagliflozin. SGLT-2 inhibitors are proved to be significantly associated with weight loss and reduction of blood pressure by a relatively large number of studies. The studies investigating effects of dapagliflozin on visceral fat, insulin sensitivity, serum lipids, inflammation and adipocytokines are very limited. An influence of increase in glucagon secretion by SGLT-2 inhibitors on metabolic risk factors remains unknown.
