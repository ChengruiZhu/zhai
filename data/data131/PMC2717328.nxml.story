For many species of bacteria, recombination in the form of the acquisition and expression of genes and genetic elements acquired from other bacteria, eukaryotes, and archaea, HGT is an important source of variation for adaptive evolution. Not so clear is the contribution of recombination of homologous genes to adaptive evolution and as a selective pressure for the evolution and maintenance of HGT. Using computer simulations, we explore the role of HGR to adaptive evolution and selection for the evolution and maintenance of HGT. We demonstrate that under realistic conditions by shuffling genes within a bacterial population, HGR will increase its rate of adaptive evolution. Once established, this capacity to increase the rate of adaptive evolution can serve as a selective force for the maintenance of HGT. On the other hand, HGR cannot provide an advantage to a population when its density is low or when the recombining population is rare relative to non-recombining competitors. Thus, we postulate that it is unlikely that the only bacteria—rather than plasmid (or phage)—determined mechanism of HGR, transformation, evolved in response to selection for higher rates of evolution by gene shuffling.
