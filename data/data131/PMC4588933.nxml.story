The primary dislocation cohort consisted of 37,356 patients. Median age was 34 years (IQR 22-50) and 74% were male. The average yearly incidence of primary shoulder dislocation was 23.1/100,000 person-years overall, but 45.2/100,000 person-years for patients younger than 20. Recurrent dislocation events were identified in 23% of the cohort (8573 patients), most of whom were younger (median age 24 years) and male (80%). In fact, patients younger than 20 had a 37.8% rate of recurrence (HR 1.9 (1.7-2.1), p<0.0001; compared to patient aged 36-40). Kaplan-Meier survival curves showed most recurrent dislocations took place in the first year: 93.4% at 6-months, 89.4% at 1-year, 85.2% at 2-years and 79.4% at 5-years. Protective factors against recurrence included primary relocation performed by an Orthopaedic Surgeon (HR 0.87 (0.79-0.94), p=0.001), age over 50 years (5.5% rate; HR 0.70 (0.61-0.80, p<0.0001) and an associated tuberosity fracture (HR 0.51 (0.42-0.63), p<0.0001), while lowest income quintile was a risk factor for recurrence (HR 1.1 (1.04-1.16), p=0.0007). Interestingly, at 2.5 years from the primary dislocation, only 14.7% of the cohort had undergone surgical shoulder stabilization.
