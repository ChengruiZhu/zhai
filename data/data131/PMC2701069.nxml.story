Theoretical modeling is a technique widely used to study the electrical-thermal performance of different surgical procedures based on tissue heating by use of radiofrequency (RF) currents. Most models employ a parabolic heat transfer equation (PHTE) based on Fourierâ€™s theory, which assumes an infinite propagation speed of thermal energy. We recently proposed a one-dimensional model in which the electrical-thermal coupled problem was analytically solved by using a hyperbolic heat transfer equation (HHTE), i.e. by considering a non zero thermal relaxation time. In this study, we particularized this solution to three typical examples of RF heating of biological tissues: heating of the cornea for refractive surgery, cardiac ablation for eliminating arrhythmias, and hepatic ablation for destroying tumors. A comparison was made of the PHTE and HHTE solutions. The differences between their temperature profiles were found to be higher for lower times and shorter distances from the electrode surface. Our results therefore suggest that HHTE should be considered for RF heating of the cornea (which requires very small electrodes and a heating time of 0.6 s), and for rapid ablations in cardiac tissue (less than 30 s).
