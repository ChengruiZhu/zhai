Circulating RNAs in serum, plasma or other body liquid have emerged as useful and highly promising biomarkers for noninvasive diagnostic application. Herein, we aimed to establish a serum long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) signature for diagnosing nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC). In this study, we recruited a cohort of 101 NPC patients, 20 patients with chronic nasopharyngitis (CN), 20 EBV carriers (EC) and 101 healthy controls. qRT-PCR was performed with NPC cells and serum samples to screen a pool of 38 NPC-related lncRNAs obtained from the LncRNADisease database. A profile of three circulating lncRNAs (MALAT1, AFAP1-AS1 and AL359062) was established for NPC diagnosis. By Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve analysis, this three-lncRNA signature showed high accuracy in discriminating NPC from healthy controls (AUC = 0.918), CN (AUC = 0.893) or EC (AUC = 0.877). Furthermore, high levels of these three lncRNAs were closely related to advanced NPC tumor node metastasis stages and EBV infection. Serum levels of these three lncRNAs declined significantly in patients after therapy. Our present study indicates that circulating MALAT1, AFAP1-AS1 and AL359062 may represent novel serum biomarkers for NPC diagnosis and prognostic prediction after treatment.
