The incidence of malignant melanoma, the most aggressive skin cancer, is increasing constantly. Despite new targeted therapies, the prognosis for patients with metastatic disease remains poor. Thus, there is a need for new combinational treatments, and antineoplastic agents potentially valuable in this approach are inhibitors of the ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS). In this work, we analyze the cytotoxicity mechanisms of proteasome inhibitors (MG-132, epoxomicin, and lactacystin) in a specific form of melanoma which does not synthesize melanin—the amelanotic melanoma (Ab cells). We found that the most cytotoxic of the compounds tested was epoxomicin. Caspase-9 activation as well as cytochrome C and AIF release from mitochondria indicated that exposure to epoxomicin induced the mitochondrial pathway of apoptosis. Epoxomicin treatment also resulted in accumulation of Bcl-2 family members—proapoptotic Noxa and antiapoptotic Mcl-1, which were postulated as the targets for bortezomib in melanoma. Inhibition of caspases by BAF revealed that cell death was partially caspase-independent. We observed no cell cycle arrest preceding the apoptosis of Ab cells, even though cdk inhibitors p21
