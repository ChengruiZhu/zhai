To evaluate the efficacy and safety of antibody induction therapies in kidney transplantation. Systematic literature searches were undertaken using MEDLINE, Embase, and Cochrane Library database from 1980 to 2016. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing three antibody induction therapies (alemtuzumab, interleukin-2 receptor antibodies and antithymocyte globulin) between each other were identified. Bayesian network meta-analysis was used to combine both the direct and indirect evidence on treatment efficacy and its safety. Antibody induction therapy studies, comprising of 18 RCTs (3444 kidney transplant recipients), were included. Overall, alemtuzumab treatment was superior to the ATG group (OR: 0.49, 95% CI: 0.32 to 0.71) and IL-2RAs group (OR: 0.36, 95% CI: 0.25 to 0.52) for reducing the 1-year acute rejection in kidney transplant recipients. Although alemtuzumab treatment was nearly same with ATG group and IL-2RAs group in improving patient survival and renal function, it can reduce the adverse effects of cytomegalovirus infection more efficiently than ATG group (OR: 0.59, 95% CI: 0.32 to 0.95) and IL-2RAs group (OR: 1.08, 95% CI: 0.61 to 1.73). Alemtuzumab was not associated with increased other adverse effects. Alemtuzumab treatment is safe and effective for kidney transplant recipients. No serious adverse effects were observed in trials or in general populations.
