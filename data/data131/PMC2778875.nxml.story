Huntington's disease (HD) is a neurodegenerative disorder that belongs to a family of genetic diseases caused by abnormal expansion of CAG/CTG repetitive sequences. The instability of trinucleotide repeat expansions in germline and somatic cells has deleterious clinical consequences in HD. For instance, transmission of longer repeats to offspring results in an earlier onset of disease, where extensive somatic expansion in the striatum, the brain region primarily affected in HD, is proposed to accelerate disease pathology. Thus, understanding the mechanisms of trinucleotide repeat instability is a major interest. We have examined the role of oxidative DNA damage and base excision repair (BER) in somatic instability, which is tissue-selective and age-dependent. We show that oxidative DNA lesions abnormally accumulate at CAG expansions in a length-dependent, yet age- and tissue-independent manners, likely due to the secondary structures formed by CAG repeats that limit access of enzymes initiating BER. In addition, our data indicate that repair by BER enzymes of some of the accessible lesions results in somatic expansion when the ratio of FEN1 to POLÎ² is low, as found to occur in the striatum. Our results support BER enzyme stoichiometry as a contributor to the tissue selectivity of somatic CAG expansion in HD.
