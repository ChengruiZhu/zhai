While ice massage (IM) is a rapid cooling technique used to facilitate therapeutic movements in the rehabilitation process, evidence of its efficacy over alternative therapeutic protocols is scarce. We determined whether dabbing the skin surface dry during a standard IM treatment would lead to greater rate of skin temperature reduction in comparison to without dabbing; and whether dabbing the skin would lead to an acute change in flexibility. Sixteen healthy volunteers received a “dabbing” and “non-dabbing” 7-minute IM treatment over the surface of each triceps surae muscle. Minute-by-minute temperature change in skin surface was evaluated using an infrared thermometer. Active (AROM) and passive (PROM) range of motion were evaluated via hand-held goniometer and passive stretch force was evaluated with an algometer. Dependent variables (reported as Mean ± SD) were tested with two-way analysis of variance with repeated measures. Skin temperature (°C) was reduced to with dabbing (5.8 ± 1.1) in comparison to without dabbing (6.8 ± 1.4), evoking significantly greater cooling at 1-min of ice massage (group X time interaction, p<0.01). However, after two minutes of IM, each method of application evoked similar surface temperatures. There was no significant difference in AROM, with dabbing (−0.63 ± 2.55°) in comparison to without dabbing (1.18 ± 2.90°), and no significant difference in passive-length tension relations (p>0.05) for either IM group. The dabbing protocol resulted in more rapid rate of temperature drop at 1-minute, however, both IM techniques are sufficient in cooling surface temperature after 2-minutes of IM. Further study is warranted to determine the clinical significance of the dabbing procedure.
