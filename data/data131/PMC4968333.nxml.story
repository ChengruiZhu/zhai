Ninety-two patients met the inclusion criteria. The average patient age was 30.1 years (range, 14-49 years) at the time of ACI. The average duration from microfracture to ACI was 21.2 months (range, 1-88 months). ACI was performed in the tibiofemoral compartment in 42 patients, the patellofemoral compartments in 38 patients, and in both in 12 patients. The primary lesion treated with ACI involved the MFC in 38 patients, the trochlea in 25 patients, the patella in 19 patients, and the LFC in 10 patients. The lesions averaged 467mm3 in the trochlea, 445mm3 in the LFC, 265mm3 in the patella, and 295mm3 in the patella. Nineteen patients underwent concurrent ACI to multiple lesions. Thirty-one patients underwent concomitant patellar anteromedialization, 9 patients underwent meniscal allograft, and 6 underwent realignment ostetomies (5 HTO, 1 DFO). Follow-up was available on 84 of 92 patients (91%) at an average length of follow-up of 47 months (range, 24-102 months). The control group of patients was well matched with regard to age, gender, BMI, workers compensation status, and preoperative subjective scores. Failure, defined by need for further cartilage restoration or knee arthroplasty, occurred in 8 patients (3 osteochondral allograft, 3 TKA, 1 revision ACI, 1 Denovo NT). Seventeen additional patients underwent reoperation for intra-articular debridement. There was no difference between the failure rate (8.7% v. 2.9%, p=0.21) or reoperation rate (27.2% v. 27.2%, p=0.98) in the study and control groups. For the study group, significant improvements were witnessed postoperatively for all measured questionairre parameters. No significant differences were witnessed between the study and control groups (p>0.05) with regard to any of the postoperative subjective parameters (Figure).
