Task- or stimulus-related changes of brain dynamics have been the subject of intense investigation during the last years. One of the most robust hallmarks of task/stimulus-driven brain dynamics, as measured using diverse recording techniques, is the decrease of variability with respect to the spontaneous level. This has led several researchers to focus on the second-order statistics of evoked activity and to study their functional consequences for information processing. In particular, it was observed that the trial-to-trial variability (related to variable responses to an identical stimulus from one presentation to the next) and the temporal variance of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) signals decrease in the task-driven activity. Here, we built a computational model of the whole brain to understand how local and large-scale brain dynamics contribute to these effects. The model allowed us to derive equations for the network statistics of both spontaneous and evoked activity. We observed that, as a consequence of single node and network dynamics, stimulus input impacts network statistics in such a way that the entropy of the stimulus-driven activity is lower than that during spontaneous activity. We confirmed this model prediction using empirical fMRI data and we further discuss its functional implications.
