We had earlier reported the derivation and characterization of two new sibling human embryonic stem cell lines BJNhem19 and BJNhem20, from discarded grade III embryos of Indian origin. We report here the characteristics of the two sibling cell lines after long-term continuous culture for over 2 yr during which they have been passaged over 200 times. We show that both cell lines adapt well to culture on various mouse and human feeders as well as in feeder-free conditions. The cells show normal diploid karyotype and continue to express all pluripotency markers. Both cell lines differentiate to derivatives of all three germ layers in vitro. However as reported earlier, BJNhem19 is unable to generate teratomas in nude or SCID mice or differentiate to beating cardiomyocytes when tested over several passages during long-term stable culture. On the other hand, the cardiac differentiation capacity of BJNhem20 is greatly increased, and it can generate beating cardiomyocytes that proliferate when isolated and cultured further. In conclusion, the two cell lines have maintained a stable phenotype for over 2 yr and are indeed immortal. Their derivation from grade III embryos does not seem to have any adverse effect on their long-term phenotype. The cells can be obtained for research purposes from the UK Stem Cell Bank and from the authors.
