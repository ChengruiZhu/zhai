The small intestinal epithelium, like our skin, is constantly being renewed. In the intestine however, this epithelium is exposed to the harsh digestive environment, necessitating much more rapid renewal. Remarkably, the entire epithelium is renewed every 4–5 days. This raises the question, how can the size and structure of this tissue be maintained given this pace. Motivated by recent experimental observations, we construct a three-dimensional, hybrid stochastic model to investigate the mechanisms responsible for homeostasis of this tissue. We find that there are redundant signals created by both the epithelium itself and surrounding tissues that act in parallel to maintain epithelial structure. This redundancy comes at a price however: it introduces the possibility of explosive stem cell population growth. Additional results suggest that other signals along with choreographed motion of cells are responsible for repressing this expansion. Taken together, our results provide a novel hypothesis for how robust but fast renewal of the crypt is achieved: as a balance between expansion, which drives fast renewal and repression, which holds that expansion in check to maintain the crypt’s structure.
