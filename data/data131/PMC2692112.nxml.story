Despite recommendations for annual vaccination against influenza, more than half of patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) in developed countries do not receive this vaccine. Influenza is characterized by its potentially of causing epidemics and by excess morbidity and mortality in patients with COPD and other chronic medical conditions. Good evidence of the efficacy, effectiveness, and cost-effectiveness of influenza vaccination underlines the recommendation of use in patients with COPD. Influenza vaccination could reduce influenza-related complications and exacerbations in patients with COPD, therefore reducing hospitalizations and deaths. Each year, all persons with COPD should be vaccinated with the inactivated trivalent influenza vaccine containing the most frequent two influenza A viral strains and one influenza B viral strain detected in the influenza season of the previous year. To achieve a 100% vaccination rate in patients with COPD, all patients with COPD registered in health insurance companies and attended in health centers and specialized clinics should be vaccinated during the immunization period (Octoberâ€“December). Antiviral therapies could be used as an adjunct to vaccination and to reduce influenza transmission in outbreaks. Antiviral therapies could reduce the duration and complications of influenza when administered within two days of the onset of illness. Research is necessary for new antiviral therapies that could prevent influenza with cost-effectiveness similar to the influenza vaccine.
