Alloplastic implants have been used to repair orbital wall fractures in most cases. Orbital hemorrhage is a rare complication of these implants and has been reported rarely in Korea. The purpose of this article is to report a late complication case focusing on their etiology and management. A 20-year-old male patient underwent open reduction with Medpor (porous polyethylene) insertion for bilateral orbital floor fractures. The initial symptom occurred with proptosis in the right side as well as vertical dystopia, which had started 4 days earlier, 8 months after surgery. Any trauma history after the surgery was not present. We performed an exploration and removal of hematoma with Medpor titanium meshed alloplastic implant. A case of delayed orbital hematoma following alloplastic implant insertion was identified. It occurred within the pseudocapsule of the implant. One week after surgery, overall symptoms improved successfully, and no complications were reported during the 11-month follow-up period. Although rare, orbital hemorrhage is a potential complication of alloplastic orbital floor implants, which may present many years after surgery. As in the case presented, delayed hematoma should be included in the differential diagnosis of late proptosis or orbital dystopia.
