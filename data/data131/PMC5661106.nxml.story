Type 2 diabetes is caused by defects in both insulin sensitivity and insulin secretion. Glucose triggers insulin secretion by causing exocytosis of insulin granules from pancreatic β‐cells. High circulating cholesterol levels and a diminished capacity of serum to remove cholesterol from β‐cells are observed in diabetic individuals. Both of these effects can lead to cholesterol accumulation in β‐cells and contribute to β‐cell dysfunction. However, the molecular mechanisms by which cholesterol accumulation impairs β‐cell function remain largely unknown. Here, we used total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy to address, at the single‐granule level, the role of cholesterol in regulating fusion pore dynamics during insulin exocytosis. We focused particularly on the effects of cholesterol overload, which is relevant to type 2 diabetes. We show that excess cholesterol reduced the number of glucose‐stimulated fusion events, and modulated the proportion of full fusion and kiss‐and‐run fusion events. Analysis of single exocytic events revealed distinct fusion kinetics, with more clustered and compound exocytosis observed in cholesterol‐overloaded β‐cells. We provide evidence for the involvement of the
