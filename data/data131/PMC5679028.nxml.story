To provide the best available evidence-based care to their patients, advanced practitioners (APs) must become proficient in genomic competencies and remain informed regarding the availability of pharmacogenomic tests. Databases, such as the Centers for Disease Control and Preventionâ€™s "Genomic Testing," provide guidance about pharmacogenomic testing, but many APs are not aware of these resources. This study employed a quasi-experimental pretest/posttest design using a convenience sample of APs in a large clinical outpatient breast cancer clinic to assess the knowledge base, beliefs, attitudes, and barriers regarding pharmacogenomic testing among front-line APs and increase knowledge through a targeted educational intervention. The objectives of the educational intervention were to (1) increase knowledge of the clinical indication for testing; (2) increase collaboration among the interprofessional team; and (3) identify correctly when the plan of care should be modified based on pharmacogenomic test results to optimize patient outcomes. Responses showed that these oncology APs possess a strong foundation in genetics and support the addition of new pharmacogenomic tests to their practice.
