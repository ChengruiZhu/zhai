Faithful replication of genomic DNA by DNA polymerases is crucial for maintaining the genetic integrity of an organism. If DNA becomes damaged, specialized lesion-bypass DNA polymerases are recruited to correct errors in the DNA. A variety of kinetic and structural studies have established a minimal kinetic mechanism common to all DNA polymerases. This mechanism includes several steps involving discrete protein conformational changes. However, the inter-relationship between conformational dynamics and enzymatic function has remained unclear, and identification of the rate-limiting step during nucleotide incorporation has been controversial. In this study, we monitored the directions and rates of motion of domains of a lesion-bypass polymerase during correct nucleotide incorporation. Our study provides several significant findings. First, the binding of a correct nucleotide induces a fast and surprising DNA translocation event. Second, all four domains of the polymerase rapidly move in a synchronized manner before and after the polymerization reaction. Third, repositioning of active site residues is the rate-limiting step during correct nucleotide incorporation. Thus, the motions of the polymerase and the polymerase-bound DNA substrate are tightly coupled to catalysis.
