The purpose of this study was to perform comprehensive measurements and testing of a Novalis Tx linear accelerator, and to develop technical guidelines for commissioning from the time of acceptance testing to the first clinical treatment. The Novalis Tx (NTX) linear accelerator is equipped with, among other features, a high‐definition MLC (HD120 MLC) with 2.5 mm central leaves, a 6D robotic couch, an optical guidance positioning system, as well as X‐ray‐based image guidance tools to provide high accuracy radiation delivery for stereotactic radiosurgery and stereotactic body radiation therapy procedures. We have performed extensive tests for each of the components, and analyzed the clinical data collected in our clinic. We present technical guidelines in this report focusing on methods for: (1) efficient and accurate beam data collection for commissioning treatment planning systems, including small field output measurements conducted using a wide range of detectors; (2) commissioning tests for the HD120 MLC; (3) data collection for the baseline characteristics of the on‐board imager (OBI) and ExacTrac X‐ray (ETX) image guidance systems in conjunction with the 6D robotic couch; and (4) end‐to‐end testing of the entire clinical process. Established from our clinical experience thus far, recommendations are provided for accurate and efficient use of the OBI and ETX localization systems for intra‐ and extracranial treatment sites. Four results are presented. (1)
