 differentiation of normal human uro-epithelial cells, formaldehyde-assisted isolation of regulatory elements (FAIRE-seq) and RNA-seq was used to identify alterations in chromatin accessibility and gene expression changes following activation of the nuclear receptor peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARÎ³) as a differentiation-initiating event. Regions of chromatin identified by FAIRE-seq, as having altered accessibility during differentiation, were found to be enriched with sequence-specific binding motifs for transcription factors predicted to be involved in driving basal and differentiated urothelial cell phenotypes, including forkhead box A1 (FOXA1), P63, GRHL2, CTCF and GATA-binding protein 3 (GATA3). In addition, co-occurrence of GATA3 motifs was observed within subsets of differentiation-specific peaks containing P63 or FOXA1. Changes in abundance of GRHL2, GATA3 and P63 were observed in immunoblots of chromatin-enriched extracts. Transient siRNA knockdown of P63 revealed that P63 favoured a basal-like phenotype by inhibiting differentiation and promoting expression of basal marker genes. GATA3 siRNA prevented differentiation-associated downregulation of P63 protein and transcript, and demonstrated positive feedback of GATA3 on
