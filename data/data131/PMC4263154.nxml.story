MC4-NN2-0453 is a novel, long-acting, selective, melanocortin-4-receptor agonist developed for treatment of obesity. This first-human-dose, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial investigated the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics of single and multiple doses of MC4-NN2-0453 in overweight to obese but otherwise healthy subjects. The trial included a single-dose part of ascending subcutaneous 0.03–1.50 mg/kg doses in overweight to obese but otherwise healthy men, and a multiple-dose part of ascending subcutaneous 0.75–3.0 mg/day doses in obese but otherwise healthy men/women. The single-dose part included 7 cohorts of 8 subjects, randomized 6:2 to active drug/placebo; the multiple-dose part included 4 cohorts of 20 subjects, randomized 16:4 to active drug/placebo. MC4-NN2-0453 was well tolerated and raised no safety concerns except for nonserious skin-related adverse events, this along with lack of weight loss effect led to premature termination of the trial. Headache, sexual–arousal disturbance, and penile erection were also reported. Single-dose pharmacokinetics showed dose-linearity and dose-proportionality. Maximum plasma concentration was observed after 50–100 hours, which then declined with a
