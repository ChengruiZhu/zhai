SEC2 function is required at the post-Golgi apparatus stage of the yeast secretory pathway. The SEC2 sequence encodes a protein product of 759 amino acids containing an amino terminal region that is predicted to be in an alpha-helical, coiled-coil conformation. Two temperature- sensitive alleles, sec2-41 and sec2-59, encode proteins truncated by opal stop codons and are suppressible by an opal tRNA suppressor. Deletion analysis indicates that removal of the carboxyl terminal 251 amino acids has no apparent phenotype, while truncation of 368 amino acids causes temperature sensitivity. The amino terminal half of the protein, containing the putative coiled-coil domain, is essential at all temperatures. Sec2 protein is found predominantly in the soluble fraction and displays a native molecular mass of greater than 500 kD. All phenotypes of the temperature-sensitive sec2 alleles are partially suppressed by duplication of the SEC4 gene, but the lethality of a sec2 disruption is not suppressed. The sec2-41 mutation exhibits synthetic lethality with the same subset of the late acting sec mutants as does sec4-8 and sec15-1. The Sec2 protein may function in conjunction with the Sec4 and Sec15 proteins to control vesicular traffic.
