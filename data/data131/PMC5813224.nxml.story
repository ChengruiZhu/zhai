Aberrant activation of Hedgehog (HH)/GLI signaling is causally involved in numerous human malignancies, including basal cell carcinoma (BCC) and medulloblastoma. HH pathway antagonists targeting smoothened (SMO), an essential effector of canonical HH/GLI signaling, show significant clinical success in BCC patients and have recently been approved for the treatment of advanced and metastatic BCC. However, rapid and frequent development of drug resistance to SMO inhibitors (SMOi) together with severe side effects caused by prolonged SMOi treatment call for alternative treatment strategies targeting HH/GLI signaling downstream of SMO. In this study, we report that 4SC‐202, a novel clinically validated inhibitor of class I histone deacetylases (HDACs), efficiently blocks HH/GLI signaling. Notably, 4SC‐202 treatment abrogates GLI activation and HH target gene expression in both SMOi‐sensitive and ‐resistant cells. Mechanistically, we propose that the inhibition of HDACs 1/2/3 is crucial for targeting oncogenic HH/GLI signaling, and that class I HDAC inhibitors either in combination with SMOi or as second‐line therapy may improve the treatment options for HH‐associated malignancies with SMOi resistance.
