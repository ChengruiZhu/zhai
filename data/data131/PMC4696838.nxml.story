Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is an intractable disease for which the pathological findings are characterized by temporal and spatial heterogeneity. The pathogenesis is composed of myriad factors, including repetitive injuries to epithelial cells, alterations in immunity, the formation of vascular leakage and coagulation, abnormal wound healing, fibrogenesis, and collagen accumulation. Therefore, the molecular target drugs that are used or attempted for treatment or clinical trials may not cover the myriad therapeutic targets of IPF. In addition, the complicated pathogenesis results in a lack of informative biomarkers to diagnose accurately the status of IPF. These facts point out the necessity of using a combination of drugs, that is, each single drug with molecular targets or a single drug with multiple therapeutic targets. In this review, we introduce a humoral factor, stanniocalcin-1 (STC1), which has myriad functions, including the maintenance of calcium homeostasis, the promotion of early wound healing, uncoupling respiration (aerobic glycolysis), reepithelialization in damaged tissues, the inhibition of vascular leakage, and the regulation of macrophage functions to keep epithelial and endothelial homeostasis, which may adequately cover the myriad therapeutic targets of IPF.
