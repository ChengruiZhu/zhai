Gastric cancer (GC) is the fourth most common malignant tumor globally. The highest incidence of GC is found in Eastern Asia, particularly in China. It is therefore imperative to further elucidate the molecular pathogenesis of GC in order to identify new biomarkers and targets for effective therapy. In the present study, we determined whether miR-148a was aberrantly downregulated in gastric cancer tissues and significantly correlated with aggressive clinicopathological characteristics in the MGC-803, HGC-27 and GES-1 cell lines using reverse transcription-quantitative PCR and western blot analysis. The cell lines were obtained from 60 patients who presented at our hospital between September 2010 and July 2015. The results showed that, miR-148a was aberrantly downregulated in GC tissues and its expression was relatively lower in the MGC-803 and HGC-27 GC cell lines than in the normal gastric epithelial cell line, GES-1. The clinicopathological analysis revealed that a decrease of miR-148a was significantly correlated with lymph-node metastasis (P<0.01) and tumor node metastasis (TNM) stage (P<0.05). The transwell assay showed that the re-expression of miR-148a significantly reduced cell migratory and invasive abilities
