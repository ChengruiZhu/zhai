ChIP-seq has been commonly applied to identify genomic occupation of transcription factors (TFs) in a context-specific manner. It is generally assumed that a TF should have similar binding patterns in cells from the same or closely related tissues. Surprisingly, this assumption has not been carefully examined. To this end, we systematically compared the genomic binding of the cell cycle regulator FOXM1 in eight cell lines from seven different human tissues at binding signal, peaks and target genes levels. We found that FOXM1 binding in ER-positive breast cancer cell line MCF-7 are distinct comparing to those in not only other non-breast cell lines, but also MDA-MB-231, ER-negative breast cancer cell line. However, binding sites in MDA-MB-231 and non-breast cell lines were highly consistent. The recruitment of estrogen receptor alpha (ERα) caused the unique FOXM1 binding patterns in MCF-7. Moreover, the activity of FOXM1 in MCF-7 reflects the regulatory functions of ERα, while in MDA-MB-231 and non-breast cell lines, FOXM1 activities regulate cell proliferation. Our results suggest that tissue similarity, in some specific contexts, does not hold precedence over TF-cofactors interactions in determining transcriptional states and that the genomic binding of a TF can be dramatically affected by a particular co-factor under certain conditions.
