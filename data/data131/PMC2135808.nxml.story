. hemolysis of all the cells in the substrate) even when the number of such cells is small. This may be because hemolysis progresses best at temperatures (±35°C.) which are unfavorable to the hemolytic principle and because erythrocytes vary in their susceptibility to the injurious agent. The concentration of red cells also may be a determining factor, either by affecting the rate at which the reaction proceeds or by aiding in the preservation of hemolytic activity. Although it was impossible to separate the "hemolysin" from the rickettsiae, examination of smear preparations of hemolyzing mixtures showed no consistent contact relation between cells and rickettsiae. Adsorption experiments revealed that, while removal of the cells from the hemolytic system did not reduce the hemolyzing capacity of the system, the cells carried away a significant tendency to hemolyze. It is suggested that the rate at which injury is inflicted on the red cells is dependent on the concentration of "hemolysin" present and that the process may proceed in the relative absence of rickettsiae once sufficient damage has been inflicted. The toxicity of richly infected yolk sac suspensions for intravenously inoculated mice was found to be related, not to
