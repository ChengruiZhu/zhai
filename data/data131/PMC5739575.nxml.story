Diffuse malignant mesothelioma (DMM) is one of the prognostically most discouraging cancers with median survivals of only 12–22 months. Due to its insidious onset and delayed detection, DMM is often at an advanced stage at diagnosis and is considered incurable. Combined chemo- and radiotherapy followed by surgery only marginally affect outcome at the cost of significant morbidity. Because of the long time period between exposure to asbestos and disease onset, the incidence of DMM is still rising and predicted to peak around 2020. Novel markers for the reliable diagnosis of DMM in body cavity effusion specimens as well as more effective, targeted therapies are urgently needed. Here, we show that the “don't eat me” signalling molecule CD47, which inhibits phagocytosis by binding to signal regulatory protein α on macrophages, is overexpressed in DMM cells. A two-marker panel of high CD47 expression and BRCA1-associated protein 1 (BAP-1) deficiency had a sensitivity of 78% and specificity of 100% in discriminating DMM tumour cells from reactive mesothelial cells in effusions, which is superior to the currently used four-marker combination of BAP-1, glucose transporter type 1, epithelial membrane antigen and desmin. In addition, blocking CD47 inhibited growth and promoted phagocytosis of DMM cell lines by macrophages
