The safety and immunological responsiveness of a peptide vaccine of ring finger protein 43 and 34-kDa translocase of the outer mitochondrial membrane combined with uracil-tegafur/leucovorin (UFT/LV) was previously demonstrated in metastatic colorectal cancer (CRC) in a phase I clinical trial. To clarify the survival benefit of a peptide vaccine combined with UFT/LV as adjuvant treatment, a phase II clinical trial was conducted involving patients with stage III CRC. All enrolled patients, whose human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-A status was double-blinded, were administered the same regime of a peptide vaccine and UFT/LV chemotherapy. The primary objective of the study was to compare relapse-free survival (RFS) in patients with HLA-A*2402 vs. those without HLA-A*2402. Secondary objectives included comparisons between the two groups regarding overall survival, safety, tolerability and peptide-specific activities of cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) as measured by the ELISPOT assay. Between December 2009 and December 2014, a total of 46 patients were enrolled to the present study. Three-year RFS was not significantly different between HLA-A*2402 matched and unmatched groups [67.8 vs. 73.6%, respectively; hazard ratio (HR)=1.254, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.48–4.63; P=0.706]. Three-year RFS was significantly better in patients with positive CTL responses in the HLA-A*2402 matched group compared with those without (85.7 and 33.3%, respectively; HR=0.159, 95% CI: 0.023–0.697; P=0.011). In conclusion, vaccination-induced immune responses combined with UFT/LV were positively associated with survival benefit in patients with HLA-A*2402-positive stage III CRC. Further study is required to clarify whether vaccination-induced immune responses shortly following the initiation of therapy can predict the therapeutic effect and help develop a promising therapeutic strategy for patients with stage III CRC.
