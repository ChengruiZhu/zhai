Vascularization deficiency caused a lot of diseases, such as diabetes ulcer and myocardial infarction. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), with the self-renewal and multipotent differentiation capacities, have been used for many diseases treatment through regulation microenvironment. Numerous studies reported that MSCs transplantation could largely improve cutaneous wound healing via paracrine secretion of growth factors. However, whether MSCs take part in the angiogenesis process directly remains elusive. Previous study proved that autophagy inhibited immunosuppressive function of MSCs and prevented the degradation of MSCs function in inflammatory and senescent microenvironment. Here, we proved that autophagy determines the therapeutic effect of MSCs in cutaneous wound healing through promoting endothelial cells angiogenesis and demonstrated that the paracrine of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) in MSCs was required in wound site. We further revealed that autophagy enhanced the VEGF secretion from MSCs through ERK phosphorylation directly. Collectively, we put forward that autophagy mediated paracrine of VEGF plays a central role in MSCs cured cutaneous wound healing and may provide a new therapeutic method for angiogenesis-related diseases.
