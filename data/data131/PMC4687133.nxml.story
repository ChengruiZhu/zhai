Progranulin (PGRN) is a cysteine rich secreted protein, expressed in epithelial cells, immune cells, neurons, and adipocytes. It was first identified for its growth factor-like properties, being involved in early embryogenesis and tissue remodeling, acting as an anti-inflammatory molecule. In the central nervous system, PGRN has neurotrophic and neuroprotective actions. There is also evidence of PGRN effects on cancer, contributing to tumor proliferation, invasion and cell survival. Recently, PGRN was recognized as an adipokine related to obesity and insulin resistance, revealing its metabolic function and pro-inflammatory properties. In obesity and type 2 diabetes mellitus, PGRN levels are increased. In renal disease, there is a relevant association, however, it is not known if it could contribute to kidney damage or if it is only a route of PGRN elimination. PGRN is an emerging molecule which demands studies in different fields. Possibly, it plays distinct functions in different tissues/cells and metabolic conditions. Here, we discuss potential mechanisms and recent data of PGRN pro-inflammatory actions, regarding obesity, insulin resistance, type 2 diabetes mellitus and kidney disease.
