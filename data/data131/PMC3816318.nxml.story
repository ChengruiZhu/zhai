Historically, cancer research has focused on identifying mutations or amplification of genes within the tumor, which informed the development of targeted therapies against affected pathways. This work often considers tumor cells in isolation; however, it is becoming increasingly apparent that the microenvironment surrounding tumor cells strongly influences tumor onset and progression. This is the so-called “seed and soil” hypothesis wherein the seed (cancer cell) is fed and molded by the metabolites, growth factors, modifications of the extracellular matrix or angiogenic factors provided by the soil (or stroma). Currently, 65% of the US population is obese or overweight; similarly staggering figures are reported in US children and globally. Obesity mediates and can exacerbate, both normal and tumor microenvironment dysfunction. Many obesity-associated endocrine, metabolic and inflammatory mediators are suspected to play a role in oncogenesis by modifying systemic nutrient metabolism and the nutrient substrates available locally in the stroma. It is vitally important to understand the biological processes linking obesity and cancer to develop better intervention strategies aimed at curbing the carcinogenic events associated with obesity. In this review, obesity-driven changes in both the normal and tumor microenvironment, alterations in metabolism, and release of signaling molecules such as endocrine, growth, and inflammatory mediators will be highlighted. In addition, we will discuss the effects of the timing of obesity onset or particular “windows of susceptibility,” with a focus on breast cancer etiology.
