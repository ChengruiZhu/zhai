When two populations adapt to different ecological environments, they may become reproductively incompatible with each other and eventually form distinct species. One form of incompatibility thought to contribute to this process occurs when hybrids between diverging populations are ecologically maladapted. They suffer reduced survival and reproduction because they possess intermediate traits that are ill-suited to both parental environments. Although this phenomenon is potentially important at the early stages of speciation, it is difficult to study in the field and is often invisible in the laboratoryâ€”leaving us with few empirical examples. We use a series of behavioral assays and manipulative field experiments to examine hybrids between populations of a butterfly that have adapted to use distinct host plants. We show that the hybrids are perfectly healthy in the laboratory. However, when taken into the field, they interact with their host plants in intermediate and anomalous ways that lower the growth and survival of both themselves and their offspring. Our findings confirm that ecological selection against hybrids has great potential to block gene flow at the early stages of adaptive divergence.
