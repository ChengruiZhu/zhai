Variability from one cell to another is a pronounced and universal trend in living organisms; much of this variability is related to varying concentrations of proteins and other chemical species across the cells. Understanding this variability is necessary if we are to fully understand cellular functions, particularly the ways in which cells differ from each other and in which cells with the same origin behave in different ways (e.g. in human development and cancer). When using a chemical model for some aspect of cellular function, one needs to consider two sources of variability: intrinsic variability, which results from the reactions proceeding as in the model but naturally varying because of the finite number of molecules in the cells and their random behavior; and extrinsic variability, which results from other kinds of variation not accounted for in the specific, deterministic model. We present new methods to model and compute both kinds of variability, to facilitate the study of cellular variability as a whole. Our methods provide advantages in speed, accuracy, and scope of mechanisms modeled, and we apply them to experimental data, demonstrating the nature of intrinsic and extrinsic noise in those systems.
