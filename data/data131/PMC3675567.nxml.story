. We explored the effects of expression of either a WT or catalytically inactive (E198A) mutant version of MMP-8 in human breast cancer cell lines. Analysis of serum-free conditioned media from three breast cancer cell lines (MCF-7, SK-BR-3, and MDA-MB-231) expressing WT MMP-8 revealed elevated levels of IL-6 and IL-8. This increase was mirrored at the mRNA level and was dependent on MMP-8 catalytic activity. However, sustained expression of WT MMP-8 by breast cancer cells was non-permissive for long-term growth, as shown by reduced colony formation compared with cells expressing either control vector or E198A mutant MMP-8. In long-term culture of transfected MDA-MB-231 cells, expression of WT but not E198A mutant MMP-8 was lost, with IL-6 and IL-8 levels returning to base line. Rare clonal isolates of MDA-MB-231 cells expressing WT MMP-8 were generated, and these showed constitutively high levels of IL-6 and IL-8, although production of the interleukins was no longer dependent upon MMP-8 activity. These studies support a causal connection between MMP-8 activity and the IL-6/IL-8 network, with an acute response to MMP-8 involving induction of the proinflammatory mediators, which may in part serve to compensate for the deleterious effects of MMP-8 on breast cancer cell growth. This axis may be relevant to the recognized ability of MMP-8 to orchestrate the innate immune system in inflammation
