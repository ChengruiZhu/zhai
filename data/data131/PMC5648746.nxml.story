Ixazomib is an oral proteasome inhibitor, approved in USA, Canada, Australia and Europe in combination with lenalidomide and dexamethasone, for the treatment of patients with multiple myeloma who have received at least one prior therapy. We report a population pharmacokinetic model-based analysis for ixazomib that was pivotal in describing the clinical pharmacokinetics of ixazomib, to inform product labelling. Plasma concentration–time data were collected from 755 patients who received oral or intravenous ixazomib in once- or twice-weekly schedules in ten trials, including the global phase III TOURMALINE-MM1 study. Data were analysed using nonlinear mixed-effects modelling (NONMEM software version 7.2, ICON Development Solutions, Hanover, MD, USA). Ixazomib plasma concentrations from intravenous and oral studies were described by a three-compartment model with linear distribution and elimination kinetics, including first-order linear absorption with a lag time describing the oral dose data. Body surface area on the volume of the second peripheral compartment was the only covariate included in the final model. None of the additional covariates tested including body surface area (1.2–2.7 m
