. 145:851–863). In this study, we report the cloning and initial characterization of a new paxillin LD motif–binding protein, actopaxin. Analysis of the deduced amino acid sequence of actopaxin reveals a 42-kD protein with two calponin homology domains and a paxillin-binding subdomain (PBS). Western blotting identifies actopaxin as a widely expressed protein. Actopaxin binds directly to both F-actin and paxillin LD1 and LD4 motifs. It exhibits robust focal adhesion localization in several cultured cell types but is not found along the length of the associated actin-rich stress fibers. Similar to paxillin, it is absent from actin-rich cell–cell adherens junctions. Also, actopaxin colocalizes with paxillin to rudimentary focal complexes at the leading edge of migrating cells. An actopaxin PBS mutant incapable of binding paxillin in vitro cannot target to focal adhesions when expressed in fibroblasts. In addition, ectopic expression of the PBS mutant and/or the COOH terminus of actopaxin in HeLa cells resulted in substantial reduction in adhesion to collagen. Together, these results suggest an important role for actopaxin in integrin-dependent remodeling of the actin cytoskeleton during cell motility and cell adhesion.
