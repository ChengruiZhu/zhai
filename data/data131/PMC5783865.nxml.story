 mycelia, has anti‐oxidative, antithrombotic and antitumour properties. In this study, other major attributes of CME‐1, namely anti‐inflammatory and immunomodulatory properties, were investigated. Treating lipopolysaccharide (LPS)‐stimulated RAW 264.7 cells with CME‐1 concentration‐dependently suppressed nitric oxide formation and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) expression. In the CME‐1‐treated RAW 264.7 cells, LPS‐induced IκBα degradation and the phosphorylation of p65, Akt and mitogen‐activated protein kinases (MAPKs), including extracellular signal‐regulated kinase, c‐Jun N‐terminal kinase and p38, were reduced. Treatment with a protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A)‐specific inhibitor, significantly reversed the CME‐1‐suppressed iNOS expression; IκBα degradation; and p65, Akt and MAPK phosphorylation. PP2A activity up‐regulation and PP2A demethylation reduction were also observed in the cells. Moreover, CME‐1‐induced PP2A activation and its subsequent suppression of LPS‐activated RAW 264.7 cells were diminished by the inhibition of ceramide signals. LPS‐induced reactive oxygen species (ROS) and hydroxyl radical formation were eliminated by treating RAW 264.7 cells with CME‐1. Furthermore, the role of ceramide signalling pathway and anti‐oxidative property were also demonstrated in CME‐1‐mediated inhibition of LPS‐activated primary peritoneal macrophages. In conclusion, CME‐1 suppressed iNOS expression by up‐regulating ceramide‐induced PP2A activation and reducing ROS production in LPS‐stimulated macrophages. CME‐1 is a potential therapeutic agent for treating inflammatory diseases.
