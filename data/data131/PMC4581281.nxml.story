. However, kansenone exerts serious toxicity, but the exact mechanism was not clear. In this work, the effects of kansenone on cell proliferation, cell cycle, cell damage, and cell apoptosis were investigated. The suppression of cell proliferation was assessed via the colorimetric MTT assay, and cell morphology was visualized via inverted microscopy after IEC-6 cells were incubated with different concentrations of kansenone. Reactive oxygen species (ROS), superoxide dismutase (SOD) and malondialdehyde (MDA) content were detected for evaluating cell damage. RNase/propidium iodide (PI) labeling for evaluation of cell cycle distribution was performed by flow cytometry analysis. Annexin V-fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)/PI and Hoechst 33342/Annexin V-FITC/PI staining assay for cell apoptosis detection were performed using confocal laser scanning microscopy and high content screening. Moreover, apoptosis induction was further confirmed by transmission electron microscope (TEM) and JC-1 mitochondrial membrane potential, western blot and RT-PCR analysis. The results demonstrated that kansenone exerted high cytotoxicity, induced cell arrest at G0/G1 phase, and caused mitochondria damage. In addition, kansenone could up-regulate the apoptotic proteins Bax, AIF, Apaf-1, cytochrome
