There were no significant differences in terms of patient characteristics in the 2 groups. Thirty-three were isolated aortic valve replacements (45.2%); 28 were isolated mitral valve replacements (38.4%); 10 were combined aortic and mitral replacements (13.7%); 2 were combined tricuspid and mitral replacements (2.7%). The overall hospital mortality was 5.5% (n = 4) and was not different between Group B (5.3%) and Group M (5.7%). Low ejection fraction was the only independent predictors of hospital mortality. There was no significant difference between the groups in the overall rate of complications. The overall mean follow-up was 47 ± 23 months. According to the Kaplan-Meier analysis, late mortality, perivalvular leak and freedom from reoperation were similar in patients with mechanical and bioprosthesis valves. The bioprosthesis valve group had significantly higher freedom from thromboembelism-bleeding events (100% versus 77.6 ± 11.0%, p = 0.012), and valve-related morbidity (73.2 ± 10.1% versus 58.1 ± 10.9%, p = 0.035) in 5 years. Kaplan–Meier survival estimates at 1, 3, and 5 years were 0.971, 0.832, and 0.530 in group B, and 0.967, 0.848, and 0.568 in group M.
