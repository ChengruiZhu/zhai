A high-calorie diet (HCD) induces two mutually exacerbating effects contributing to diet-induced obesity (DIO): impaired glucose metabolism and increased food consumption. A link between the metabolic and behavioral manifestations is not well understood yet. We hypothesized that chronic inflammation induced by HCD plays a key role in linking together the two components of diet-induced pathology. Based on this hypothesis, we tested if a plasmid (DNA vaccine) encoding p62 (SQSTM1) would alleviate DIO including its metabolic and/or food consumption abnormalities. Previously we reported that injections of the p62 plasmid reduce chronic inflammation during ovariectomy-induced osteoporosis. Here we found that the p62 plasmid reduced levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-1β, IL-12, and INFγ and increased levels of anti-inflammatory cytokines IL-4, IL-10 and TGFβ in HCD-fed animals. Due to this anti-inflammatory response, we further tested whether the plasmid can alleviate HCD-induced obesity and associated metabolic and feeding impairments. Indeed, p62 plasmid significantly reversed effects of HCD on the body mass index (BMI), levels of glucose, insulin and glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c). Furthermore, p62 plasmid partially restored levels of the satiety hormone, serotonin, and tryptophan, simultaneously reducing activity of monoamine oxidase (MAO) in the brain affected by the HCD. Finally, the plasmid partially reversed increased food consumption caused by HCD. Therefore, the administering of p62 plasmid alleviates both metabolic and behavioral components of HCD-induced obesity.
