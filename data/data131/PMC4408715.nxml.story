Penile fracture is an unusual though not a rare condition but underreported. It is defined classically as the disruption of the tunica albuginea with rupture of the corpus cavernosum. Penile fracture can be misdiagnosed with rupture of corpus spongiosum clinically. Therefore, we are presenting three cases due to its varied clinical presentation and management. In first patient, there was a tear in the corpus spongiosum and a partial tear in the ventral urethra. Both defects were repaired with interrupted sutures. In the second patient, there was a rupture of corpus cavernosum, which was primarily repaired. After 1-year of primary surgery, patient again came with similar complaints, and diagnosis of scar dehiscence was made. Patient was treated conservatively with satisfactory results on follow-up. Third patient came with a history of 1-week. Intra-operative findings revealed only hematoma without any defect in corpora cavernosum, corpus spongiosum, and urethra. Only evacuation of hematoma was done. Early surgical treatment of penile fracture is advantageous. In recurrent penile fracture, if no penile deformity or any reasonable clinical and radiological evidence, then conservative management is advocated. Even when presentation is delayed up to 1-week, operative management has shown good results.
