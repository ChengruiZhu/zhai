 1. The functional unity of cirri and membranelles can result structurally only from extensions of the ciliary membrane. 2. The pellicle is composed of an outer pellicular membrane and an inner cytoplasmic membrane. 3. The ciliary rootlets are composed of numerous filaments 120 A in diameter with central areas of low density. They have no periodic structure. 4. The ciliary membrane is a double-layered structure continuous with the pellicular membrane. The cilia show the typical arrangement of nine double, peripheral and two single, central fibrils. All fibrils pass into the basal region, the peripheral ones joining with the rootlet filaments, while the central fibrils from the extreme proximal position of the basal region turn back toward the pellicle and appear to unite just beneath the cytoplasmic membrane. 5. The cilia (300 mµ diameter) taper at their tips to a diameter at least as small as 50 mµ. At a diameter of about 150 mµ, the fibrils begin to show a reduction in number. 6. The central ciliary fibrils may determine the possible directions of ciliary beat. These fibrils show an intrafibrillar structure in their basal portion, which involves regularly spaced 40 A granules. 7. These observations on
