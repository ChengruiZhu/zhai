The ability of a hyperimmune Lew anti-BN serum (HIS) to induce enhancement of (Lew/BN)F1 kidneys transplanted into Lew recipients was compared to that of the same antiserum that had been depleted of hemagglutinating anti-Ag-B antibodies by absorption with Brown-Norway (BN) RBC-absorbed sera (RAS) or platelet-absorbed sera (PAS). The RAS and PAS were as effective as the unabsorbed HIS in abrogating early rejection as assessed by renal function and promotion of long-term survival. The absorbed sera retained the capacity to block the mixed lymphocyte culture (MLC) between Lew and BN lymphocytes and to a lesser degree the MLC between Lew and BUF, WF, AUG, and ACI lymphocytes; however, strain specificity was clearly evident at high antiserum dilutions. Similarly, these absorbed sera retained the capacity to block the Fc receptor of BN lymphocytes, and this effect was completely strain specific. In contrast, hemagglutinating and cytotoxic antibodies eluted from platelets used for antiserum absorption did not react with Fc receptors as assessed by rabbit antisheep (IgG)-coated SRBC (EA) rosette formation. F(Ab')2 fragments of PAS also blocked EA rosettes. On the other hand, complement rosettes (EAC) were not inhibited by the HIS. The antibodies were therefore directed against the Fc receptor itself or a structure spatially or functionally closely related to it. Both the Fc receptors and the enhancing capacity of the antisera were strictly specific for the BN genotype. It is suggested that the anti- "Fc receptor" antibody could play an important role in the induction of enhancement by impairing host T-B collaboration as a result of its binding to graft allogeneic "Fc receptors" which appear to be analogous to the major histocompatibility complex (MHC)-coded Ia antigens of the mouse.
