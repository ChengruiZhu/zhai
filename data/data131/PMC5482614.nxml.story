Competing endogenous RNA (ceRNA) is a newly proposed mechanism that describes a crosstalk among lncRNAs, mRNAs and their shared miRNAs. In this study, the role of miR-338-3p (miR-338) in the progression of esophageal cancer and its involve in the ceRNA regulatory circuit lncRNA-Snhg1/CST3 were explored. MiR-338 displayed a 30% decreased expression in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma tissues compared with the adjacent. Then, proto-oncogene CST3 was predicted and validated as a target gene of miR-338. Gain-and-loss-function experiments indicated that miR-338 suppressed expression of CST3 protein (also Cystatin C, CysC), promoted expression of apoptotic proteins caspase-8/3, attenuated esophageal carcinoma cell growth and induced its apoptosis. In addition, lncRNA-Snhg1 was significantly upregulated in esophageal carcinoma tissues and promoted esophageal carcinoma cell growth. Furthermore, our results from bioinformatics, luciferase reporter gene and RNA pull-down assays indicated that Snhg1 could be directly bound by miR-338. Snhg1 acted as a non-degradable sponge to relieve the suppression on CST3 caused by miR-338. In conclusion, lncRNA-Snhg1 promoted cell proliferation by acting as a non-degradable sponge for the tumor suppressor miR-338 in esophageal cancer cells.
