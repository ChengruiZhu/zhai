Protein-protein interactions are paramount in any aspect of the cellular life. Some proteins form large macromolecular complexes that execute core functionalities of the cell, while others transmit information in signalling networks to co-ordinate these processes. The latter type, of more transient nature, often occurs through the recognition of a small linear sequence motif in one protein by a specialized globular domain in the other. These peptide stretches often contain a consensus pattern complementary to the interaction surface displayed by their binding partners, and adopt a well-defined structure upon binding. Information that is currently available only from high-resolution three-dimensional (3D) structures, and that can be as characteristic as the consensus motif itself. In this manuscript, we present a strategy to identify novel domain-motif interactions (DMIs) among the set of protein complexes of known 3D structures, which provides information on the consensus motif and binding domain and also allows ready identification of the key interacting residues. A detailed knowledge of the interface is critical to plan further functional studies and for the development of interfering elements, be it drug-like compounds or novel engineered binding proteins or peptides. The small interfaces typical for DMIs make them interesting candidates for all these applications.
