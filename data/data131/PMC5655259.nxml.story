Several studies have shown that anti-diabetic medications may modify the risk of cancer. We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis to evaluate the effect of alpha-glucosidase inhibitors (AGIs) on the risk of cancer in patients with diabetes mellitus. We conducted a systematic search of Medline, EMBASE, and Web of Science databases, up to September 30, 2016. Random-effects model was used to estimate the summary odds ratios (ORs) with 95% CI. Twenty-five studies (14 cohort, 7 case-control, and 4 randomized controlled trials) involving 1,285,433 patients with diabetes were included. Meta-analysis of observational studies showed that the use of AGIs was associated with a lower risk of developing cancer (OR = 0.86, 95% CI 0.78-0.96), especially gastrointestinal cancer (OR = 0.83, 95% CI 0.71-0.97). There was considerable heterogeneity across the studies introduced partly by the quality of included studies and adjustment for potential confounders. Meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials did not reveal any significant association between AGIs and cancer risk. Meta-analysis of observational studies indicated that AGIs may decrease the risk of cancer in individuals with diabetes.
