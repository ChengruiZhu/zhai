 by intermittently increasing the concentration of gemcitabine in the culture medium for 10 months, observing the morphology using inverted microscopy. SW1990/Gem cells were pretreated with emodin (10 μM) for different periods followed by treatment with gemcitabine (20 μM) for 48 h; cell proliferation was tested by MTT assay. SW1990/Gem cells were treated by emodin with different concentrations for 48 h, cell apoptosis was detected by flow cytometry (FCM). The expression of gene and protein, such as MDR-1 (P-gp), NF-κB, Bcl-2, Bax, cytochrome-C (cytosol), caspase-9 and -3 were measured by RT-PCR and Western blotting. The function of P-gp in SW1990/Gem cells was checked by FCM. The results showed that the SW1990/Gem cells changed greatly in morphology and the resistance index was 48.63. Emodin promoted cell apoptosis of the gemcitabine-resistant cell line SW1990/Gem in a dose-dependent manner. Emodin enhanced the SW1990/Gem cell sensitivity to gemcitabine in a time-dependent manner. Emodin monotherapy or combination with gemcitabine both decreased the gene and protein expression levels of MDR-1 (P-gp), NF-κB and Bcl-2 and inhibited the function of P-gp, but increased the expression levels of Bax, cytochrome-C (cytosol), caspase-9 and -3, and promoted cell apoptosis. This demonstrated that emodin had a reversing effect on the gemcitabine-resistant cell line SW1990/Gem, possibly via decreasing the function of P-gp and activating the mitochondrial apoptosis pathway
