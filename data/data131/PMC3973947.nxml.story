Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is a cardiovascular genetic disease with a varied clinical presentation and phenotype. Although mutations are typically found in genes coding for sarcomeric proteins, phenotypic derangements extend beyond the myocyte to include the extracellular compartment. Myocardial fibrosis is commonly detected by histology, and is associated with clinical vulnerability to adverse outcomes. Over the past decade, the noninvasive visualization of myocardial fibrosis by cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) techniques has garnered much interest given the potential applications toward improving our understanding of pathophysiologic mechanisms of disease, as well as diagnosis and prognosis. Late gadolinium enhancement (LGE) imaging techniques are able to detect focal (typically replacement) fibrosis. Newer CMR techniques that measure absolute T1 relaxation time allow the quantification of the entire range of focal to diffuse (interstitial) fibrosis and may overcome potential limitations of LGE. This review will discuss the methodology and current status of these novel techniques, with a focus on extracellular volume fraction (ECV). Recent findings describing ECV measurement in HCM will be summarized.
