The way mammals navigate in space is hypothesized to depend on neural structures in the temporal lobe including the hippocampus and medial entorhinal cortex (MEC). In particular, grid cells, neurons whose firing is mostly restricted to regions of space that form a hexagonal pattern, are believed to be an important part of this circuitry. Despite several years of work, not much is known about the correlated activity of neurons in the MEC and how grid cells are functionally coupled to each other. Here, we have taken a statistical approach to these questions and studied pairwise correlations and functional connections between simultaneously recorded grid cells. Through careful statistical analysis, we demonstrate that grid cells with nearby firing vertices tend to have positive effects on eliciting responses in each other, while those further apart tend to have inhibitory or no effects. Cells that respond similarly to manipulations of the environment are considered to belong to the same module. Cells belonging to a module have stronger interactions with each other than those in different modules. These results are consistent with and shed light on the population-based mechanisms suggested by models for the generation of grid cell firing.
