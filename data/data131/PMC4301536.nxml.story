Inflammatory myofibroblastic tumor (IMT) is a rare, benign neoplasm that most commonly occurs in pediatric patients; it has been described as a pseudosarcomatous proliferation of spindled myofibroblasts mixed with lymphoplasmacytic cells. IMT has been reported in a number of locations throughout the body; however, cases occurring in the gastrointestinal tract are rare and to date, no case involving both the stomach and spleen has been reported. The current study presents a case of an extremely large IMT invading both the stomach and spleen in a 50-year-old female, presenting with a three-month history of left-sided abdominal distension without abdominal pain, fever or vomiting. As the tumor had invaded the stomach and spleen, it was completely excised and concomitantly, the entire stomach and spleen were removed. Histological examination of the biopsy revealed fascicles of spindle cells in a mixed inflammatory background, with inflammatory cells that were immunopositive for vimentin, smooth muscle actin, and negative for anaplastic lymphoma kinase and CD30, confirming the diagnosis of IMT. Four months following local excision of the mass, accompanied by a total gastrectomy and splenectomy, no abdominal distension, abdominal pain, fever or vomiting were observed and no IMT recurrence was identified.
