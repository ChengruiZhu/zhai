. A medium and a new method, the "spotting technique," are described, by means of which initial cultures of the parasites were obtained from eggs within capsules, from ova and fat tissue bacteriocytes. Two conditions appear necessary, one to initiate adaptation to the new environment, the other to bring its complete realization to fruition. When development has been properly initiated, further adaptation occurs with successive transfers until finally certain other media appear suitable. Approximately 14 per cent of the isolation and cultivation attempts succeeded. All of the isolations were studied and it was found that three morphologically distinct types had been cultivated. In general one host yielded only one type, but one female revealed three types and another two. One type was also isolated once from a fecal emulsion. The probable reason for this result is discussed. The three types isolated were diphtheroidal bacilli resembling one another closely enough to be considered a single species but invariably offering distinct minor differences to warrant a separation into three distinct types. These three types have remained true to their original forms and sizes through 52 transfers. The sizes, general morphology, and tinctorial reactions of the three types cultivated correspond to the intracellular parasites of
