 With the aid of solutions of vital dyes the lymphatic capillaries in the ear of the mouse have been studied during the period of immediate reaction to injuries of various sorts and during the period of repair. The behavior of lymphatics severed by incision differs greatly from that of the small blood vessels. Instead of closing they sometimes remain open for as long as 48 hours. Materials introduced into the wound pass directly into the lymphatics through their gaping ends, a fact which will explain why infection from incisions is predominantly along the lymphatics. All around an injury the lymphatics are rendered abnormally permeable. So, too, are the blood vessels, a fact well recognized in the past. Twenty-four to 48 hours later, at a time when the blood vessels in the edematous tissue surrounding the injured area are still much more permeable than normal, the draining lymphatics allow far less to escape than usual. The possible reasons for this have been discussed. The lymphatics participate in the removal of fluid from the edematous tissue. As repair after injury takes place severed lymphatics may reunite when as yet there are no functioning blood vessels. Later an active hyperplasia of the lymphatic channels occurs, an extraordinarily abundant plexus of minute lymph capillaries budding into the area under repair.
