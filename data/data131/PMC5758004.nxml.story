A 44-year-old male was diagnosed to have relapsing polychondritis on the basis of recurrent acute auricular chondritis, deformity of the ear, saddle nose deformity and painful nasal chondritis, acute ocular inflammation with conjunctivitis, episcleritis and keratouveitis, laryngotracheal chondritis, erythema nodosum in the skin, a history of polyarthritis, and abnormal blood examination findings. The acute ocular and auricular inflammation was resolved with oral corticosteroid treatment. Intraocular pressure (IOP) of the left eye was 60 mmHg as measured by Goldmann applanation tonometer. Gonioscopic observation revealed the presence of peripheral anterior synechiae and plateau iris configuration. Express drainage screw implantation was applied to the left eye, because topical and systemic medicines failed to decrease the IOP. After 12 months, complicated cataract aggravated in the right eye, and phacoemulsification operation was performed with corticosteroids administered during the perioperative period. His corrected visual acuity was 20/20 for the right eye, and the IOP remained below 21 mmHg for the left eye. The patient has been healthy, without any recurrence, for 36 months.
