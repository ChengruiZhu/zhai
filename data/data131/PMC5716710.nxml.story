The main function of the mammary gland is to secret milk for newborn growth. Milk production process is regulated by hormones, growth factors, noncoding RNAs and other factors locally. Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs), one type of recently discovered non-coding RNA, have been found in mammary gland and some studies suggested lncRNA may play important roles in mammary gland development. Competing endogenous RNAs (ceRNAs) are emerging to compete for miRNA binding and, in turn, regulate each other. In the current study, we sequenced mRNA, miRNA and lncRNA in goat mammary tissue at 2 points in lactation (early and mature). All data were co-expressed together from the same samples. Our data showed that the ceRNAs up-regulated during the mature lactation phase were associated with lipid, protein, carbon and amino acid synthesis and metabolism. This correlates with the function of the mature lactation phase: i.e. the continuous production of large amounts of milk, rich in proteins, lipids, amino acids and other nutrients. Alternately, the ceRNAs up-regulated during early lactation were associated with PI3K-AKT pathways and ECM-receptor interactions; these fulfil the functional role of preparing the mammary gland for full lactation. Therefore, the results suggest that ceRNAs work synergistically during different developmental stages to regulate specific functions associated with lactation control. This study suggests that ceRNAs (lncRNA-mRNA) may be involved in lactation process.
