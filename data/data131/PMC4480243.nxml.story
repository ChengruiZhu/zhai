Multiple myeloma is a malignant plasma-cell disorder that primarily involves the bone marrow, but extramedullary involvement is becoming increasingly common (Blad√© et al., 2012) both at initial presentation and follow-up. Most common initial presentations for multiple myeloma include generalized fatigue, renal insufficiency, bone pain, and recurrent bacterial infections. We present a case of a healthy 55-year-old man that presented to the emergency department with a three-week history of anorexia and jaundice without any past medical history. Patient's initial labs were significant for hyperbilirubinemia and elevated liver function enzymes (AST, ALT, ALP, and GGT). Additional laboratory workup was significant for mild hypercalcemia and increased protein gap. MRI and ERCP suggested primary sclerosing cholangitis but were not diagnostic. Liver biopsy illustrated plasma-cell infiltration and bone marrow biopsy diagnosed multiple myeloma with extramedullary disease. Patient was started on dexamethasone, bortezomib, and cyclophosphamide, but, despite this aggressive regimen, the patient continued to decline. We take this opportunity to present this atypical presentation of a common hematological malignancy and review the associated literature.
