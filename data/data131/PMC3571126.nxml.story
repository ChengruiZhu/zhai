One of the most urgent problems in resource-poor areas of the world is a shortage of doctors, and especially medical specialists. The biggest implementation of the Sana platform so far has been for the early detection of oral cancer in rural south India. It enables frontline community health workers to screen for precancerous and cancerous lesions by using Sanaâ€™s clinical decision support tools in dental hospitals and primary health clinics. Diagnosing oral cancer lesions at an early stage can reduce morbidity, mortality and cost of treatment. Screening processes also increase awareness of risk factors for oral cancer among the population, such as smoking and betel nut chewing. The solution was first implemented in June 2010 and more local health workers and support staff were brought on board in February 2011. By August 2010, up to 6000 people had been screened for oral cancer in the state of Karnataka. 300 patients were identified as high risk and their clinical data, including a photo of the inside of their mouth, were reviewed by an oral cancer specialist at a large tertiary care centre. The plan over the next year is to scale the project to screen one and a half million people in the province of Karnataka.
