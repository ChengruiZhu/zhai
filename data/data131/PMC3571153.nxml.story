Whzan Telehealth Service has now been used by a number of patients with long-term chronic conditions and monitored on a PCT level. A GP has deployed the service to ‘Frequent flyer’ COPD patient having 2–4 unplanned hospital admissions a week resulting in a dramatic total cessation of emergency calls. One admission costs the NHS more than 3 years of the Whzan service. It is about to be deployed to post-operative patients released early from hospital. Patients find Whzan Telehealth easy and discreet to use. They like the security offered by a Telehealth service at the same time as they appreciate the freedom provided by the portability of Whzan. The carry case for instruments is seen as practical and helping keep the monitoring discreet. Non-native English speakers in the patient group have encouraged the development of the audible and written instructions in multiple languages. A simple user interface is clear and understandable and patients are able to use the system after a very brief demonstration. Instrumentation is wireless and operation is completely automatic. Healthcare professionals appreciate the simplicity in deployment as patients can literally walk out of their appointments with the Whzan carry out pack and use the service at home. Patient management is via a web-based triage system showing everything from patient readings to equipment battery status. Clinicians can remotely change the measurement regime to suit the patient’s symptoms. Whzan also links to a third party interactive voice telephone system that can be used to provide alerts or front line patient management.
