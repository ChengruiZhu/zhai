In this paper we show that within modular networks (that is, networks with multiple scales of connections), two distinct mechanisms may drive the emergence of synchrony at the global level. We term the first of these mechanisms “network-driven synchrony”, which is characterized by the presence of cycles within the macroscopic network. The second mechanism we term “node-driven”, which is characterized by the ability of an individual node (or nodes) to drive synchrony across the rest of the network, due to the hierarchical structure of the macroscopic network. By applying this framework to routine clinically collected resting state data from people with idiopathic generalized epilepsy and from age matched healthy controls, we demonstrate that functional networks of people with epilepsy have a significantly enhanced capacity to synchronize than those of people without epilepsy. This finding suggests a critical role for the connectivity structure of large-scale networks in the tendency to have seizures. Further, by deriving a mathematical equation for the global synchrony of the network, we make it computationally tractable to analyze data in close to real time. This gives our method potential to be used within the clinic as a diagnostic aid for clinicians treating neurological disease.
