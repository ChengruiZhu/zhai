 suspensions is approximately the same. This is true for either lag phase cells or log phase cells. 2. The amount of nucleic acid synthesized per cell in normal cultures increases during the lag period and remains fairly constant during log growth. 3. The amount of nucleic acid synthesized per cell by infected cells increases during the whole course of the infection. 4. Infected cells synthesize less RNA and more DNA than normal cells. The ratio of RNA/DNA is larger in lag phase cells than in log phase cells. 5. Normal cells release neither ribonucleic acid nor desoxyribonucleic acid into the medium. 6. Infected cells release both ribonucleic acid and desoxyribonucleic acid into the medium. The time and extent of release depend upon the physiological state of the cells. 7. Infected lag phase cells may or may not show an increased RNA content. They release RNA, but not DNA, into the medium well before observable cellular lysis and before any virus is liberated. At virus liberation, the cell RNA content falls to a value below that initially present, while DNA, which increased during infection falls to approximately the original value. 8. Infected log cells show a continuous loss of cell RNA and a loss of DNA a short time after infection. At the time of virus liberation the cell RNA value is well below that initially present and the cells begin to lyse.
