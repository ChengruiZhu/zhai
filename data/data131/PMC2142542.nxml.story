 cell is not moved by currents against the side of the chamber. Sudden increases in hydrostatic pressure from zero to 1000 lbs. or 0 to 5000 lbs. per square inch or 5000 to 9000 lbs. per square inch usually do not stimulate to "shock stoppage" of cyclosis, but some cells are stimulated. Sudden decreases of pressure are more likely to stimulate, again with variation depending on the cell. In the absence of stimulation, the cyclosis velocity at 23°C. slows as the pressure is increased in steps of 1000 lbs. per square inch. In some cells a regular slowing is observed, in others there is little slowing until 4000 to 6000 lbs. per square inch, when a rapid slowing appears, with only 50 per cent to 30 per cent of the original velocity at 9000 lbs. per square inch. The cyclosis does not completely stop at 10000 lbs. per square inch. The pressure effect is reversible unless the cells have been kept too long at the high pressure. At low temperatures (10°C.) and at temperatures near and above (32°–38°C.) the optimum temperature for maximum cyclosis (35–36°C.) pressures of 3000 to 6000 lbs. per square inch cause only further slowing of cyclosis, with no reversal of the temperature effect, such as has been observed in pressure-temperature studies on the luminescence of luminous bacteria. Sudden increase in temperature may cause shock stoppage of cyclosis as well as sudden decrease in temperature.
