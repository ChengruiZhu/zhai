Gene signatures are a powerful tool to investigate biological processes in human cancer. However, it is clear that these gene signatures do not fully reflect the complexity of human cancer. Here we demonstrate how a latent factor model can improve the in vivo relevance of these pathway-associated gene signatures by dissecting them into co-regulated transcriptional components which better represent the structure in human cancer. We use this approach to analyze hypoxia and lactic acidosis gene signatures to identify latent factors that represent distinct, interacting components of the various biological processes which are in the initial gene signatures but poorly dissected. Some factors are clustered in small chromosomal regions and their expression values are highly correlated with their DNA copy number in both cancer cell lines and human tumors. Therefore, the gene dosage at the DNA levels may explain the differences in gene expression. Several factors contain genes which are known to directly modulate the hypoxia response and allow us to generate testable hypotheses regarding particular copy number changes and hypoxia signatures. Therefore, the use of latent factor analysis is a powerful means to identify pathway-associated changes in the DNA copy number and gene dosage.
