Papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC) is the most common type of endocrine malignancy and accounts for ~80% of thyroid carcinomas in adults and 90% in children. Risk stratification is important for identifying patients at higher risk and, for this reason, recent advances in molecular genetics of thyroid cancer can be applied to provide novel biomarkers useful in understanding tumor behavior. B-Raf proto-oncogene, serine/threonine kinase (BRAF) and rat sarcoma (RAS) mutations have been widely studied and appear to have an important role in thyroid tumorigenesis. Somatic telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT) promoter mutations have been recently identified in several types of malignant tumors, including thyroid neoplasia; however, the actual role of TERT mutations in thyroid tumorigenesis is still under debate. In the present study, the mutational status of BRAF, RAS and TERT was analyzed in order to elucidate the roles of these genes in thyroid tumorigenesis. The TERT mutational analysis was also correlated with an immunohistochemical study of TERT protein expression. According to the literature, our data provide evidence of the BRAF and RAS roles in thyroid tumorigenesis, supporting an association between BRAF (V600E) mutations and the more aggressive clinical and pathological features of thyroid tumors. By contrast, TERT mutations were not significantly associated with any clinical parameters; therefore, its role in initial tumorigenesis should be further investigated.
