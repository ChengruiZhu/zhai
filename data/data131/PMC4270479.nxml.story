Mapping the genotype-phenotype relationship is necessary to understand how variable phenotypes have evolved in nature. The blue-sensitive visual pigment in human (human S1) evolved from the UV-sensitive pigment in the Boreoeutherian (or Boreotherian) ancestor (AncBoreotheria S1) by seven mutations. Mutagenesis experiments reveal that 4,008 (âˆ¼80%) of all 5,040 possible evolutionary trajectories connecting from AncBoreotheria S1 to human S1 are terminated prematurely. Quantum chemical analyses suggest that the premature termination of trajectories was caused by containing a dehydrated nonfunctional pigment. Phylogenetic analysis further suggests that the blue-sensitivity was achieved only gradually and almost exclusively by the seven non-additively interacting amino acids. During the period between 45 and 30 My ago, human S1 was in the final stage of developing its blue-sensitivity. This was the time when two red-sensitive pigments appeared by gene duplication and one of them became green-sensitive. Trichromatic color vision in the human lineage was fully developed by 30 My ago by interprotein epistasis among the three visual pigments. Manipulation of the genetically engineered ancestral molecule is the key to recapitulate the evolution of phenotypic adaptation and that of epistatic interaction separately.
