There is a steady rise in incidence of malignant salivary gland tumors in the United States, with mucoepidermoid carcinoma (MEC) the most frequent. Although 40% of MECs are found in the parotid gland, these lesions possess the capacity to develop anywhere along the aerodigestive tract. Here, we present a case of recurrent tongue MEC in a young adult female patient with history of lung malignancy and multiple brain metastases. Without a universally accepted management protocol for recurrent MECs, the current clinical practice uses tumor grade, location, and clinical progression to determine both prognosis and goals of care. The patient had transoral laser excision of the first MEC lesion in 2013. Her tongue MEC recurred 3 years later with 2 distinct lesions. One was discovered on physical examination and computed tomography and the other diagnosed intraoperatively 1 month later. These lesions were located on a previously unaffected portion of dorsal tongue base. These lesions were completely excised in the operating room. The patient currently remains on chemotherapy. This underscores the importance for developing a guideline that delineates the most efficacious surveillance and treatment plans for recurrent MECs.
