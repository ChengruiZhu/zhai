Although laparoscopy is a recognized operative approach to the management of renal masses, there is currently no standardized approach to manage bilateral synchronous renal masses. We present a case of synchronous bilateral renal masses, identified during work-up for flank pain, and managed simultaneously with laparoscopic partial nephrectomies. The patient is a 42-year-old Caucasian male found to have bilateral renal masses during evaluation for left flank pain. Cross-sectional imaging studies showed a 7.0 × 7.3 × 5.2 cm anterior, mid-to-lower pole mass on the left kidney and a 1.5 × 1.9 × 1.6 cm medial lower pole mass on the right kidney. He underwent bilateral laparoscopic partial nephrectomy at the same setting, with an uncomplicated postoperative course. Pathology report revealed clear cell renal-cell carcinoma (ccRCC) on both sides. He had normal renal function and no evidence of recurrence in the first 6 months of follow-up. This case demonstrates the possibility and safety of performing bilateral laparoscopic partial nephrectomies in one operative session. Our review of the literature supports the role of genetic counseling and the need for long-term surveillance in young patients having RCC.
