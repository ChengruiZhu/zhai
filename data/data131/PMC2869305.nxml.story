Neurons possess highly branched extensions, called dendrites, which form characteristic tree-like structures. The morphology of these dendritic arborizations can undergo significant changes in many pathological conditions. It is still poorly known, however, how alterations in dendritic morphology affect neuronal activity. Using computational models of pyramidal cells, we study the influence of dendritic tree size and branching structure on burst firing. Burst firing is the generation of two or more action potentials in close succession, a form of neuronal activity that is critically involved in neuronal signaling and synaptic plasticity. We found that there is only a range of dendritic tree sizes that supports burst firing, and that this range is modulated by the branching structure of the tree. We show that shortening as well as lengthening the dendritic tree, or even just modifying the pattern in which the branches in the tree are connected, can shift the cell's firing pattern from bursting to tonic firing, as a consequence of changes in the spatiotemporal dynamics of the dendritic membrane potential. Our results suggest that alterations in pyramidal cell morphology could, via their effect on burst firing, ultimately affect cognition.
