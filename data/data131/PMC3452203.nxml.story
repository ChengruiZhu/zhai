The aim was to investigate the immunoreactivities for NOS enzymes in frontal cortex and meningeal vessels after chemical stimulation of the subarachnoid space of adolescent rats and the effect of sumatriptan pre-treatment on the immunoreactivities of the NOS enzymes. Male adolescent Wistar rats were used. Rats in group 1 did not taken intracisternal injection. Rats in group 2 were taken intracisternal autologous blood injection, but no sumatriptan pre-treatment. Rats in group 3 were taken intracisternal autologous blood injection, but they were taken sumatriptan pre-treatment. Tissue samples were investigated for the presence of NOS immunoreactivity. The mean values of immunolabeling intensities for NOS enzymes in frontal cortex and meningeal vessels were significantly increased in group 2 compared to group 1. The mean values of immunolabeling intensities for NOS enzymes in frontal cortex and meningeal vessels were significantly reduced in group 3 compared to group 2. These results suggest that, chemical stimulation of the subarachnoid space increased the immunoreactivities of NOS enzymes in the brain of adolescent rats. The increased NOS immunoreactivities could be antagonized by pre-treatment with sumatriptan.
