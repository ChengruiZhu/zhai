Creating an effective antibody-mediated immune response relies on processes that create antibodies of high affinity and of different functions in order to clear pathogens. Activation-induced cytidine deaminase (AID) is an essential B cell–specific factor that is known to initiate these processes by deaminating dC on single-stranded DNA of actively transcribed genes. AID has also been implicated in deaminating dC at non-antibody genes, resulting in the disregulation of genes that may lead to B cell–related cancers. Until now, it has remained unknown what the source, structure, and distribution of the single-stranded DNA is that AID acts upon. By using a novel assay that allows direct detection of single-stranded DNA within intact cell nuclei, we observed patches of single-stranded DNA that are strongly correlated to the preferred activity of AID. Furthermore, we find that the activity of AID and single-stranded DNA patch formation can be enhanced by negative supercoiling of the DNA, which is a typical consequence of transcription. These findings allow us to better understand how AID is recruited to and mutates antibody genes as well as other genes implicated in cancers of B cell origin.
