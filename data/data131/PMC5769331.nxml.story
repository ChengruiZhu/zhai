Meat is a crucial nutrient for human health since it represents a giant supply of proteins, minerals, and vitamins. On the opposite hand, the intake of red and processed meat is taken into account dangerous due to its potential of carcinogenesis and cancer risk improvement, particularly for colorectal cancer (CRC), although it has been reported that also the contaminations of beef infected by oncogenic bovine viruses could increase colorectal cancerâ€™s risk. Regarding the mechanisms underlying the potential carcinogenicity of red and processed meat, different hypotheses have been proposed. A suggested mechanism describes the potential role of the heterocyclic amines (HACs) and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PHAs) in carcinogenesis induced by DNA mutation. Another hypothesis states that heme, through the lipid peroxidation process and therefore the formation of N-nitroso compounds (NOCs), produces cytotoxic and genotoxic aldehydes, resulting in carcinogenesis. Furthermore, a recent proposed hypothesis, is based on the combined actions between the N-Glycolylneuraminic acid (Neu5Gc) and genotoxic compounds. The purpose of this narrative review is to shed a light on the mechanisms underlying the potential carcinogenicity of red and processed meat, by summarizing the data reported in literature on this topic.
