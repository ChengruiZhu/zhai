The average preoperative American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons (ASES) score was 31.6 points (range, 3.3 to 63.3 points) and the average Japanese Orthopaedic Association (JOA) score was 51.6 points (26.5 to 68.5 points). Average postoperative clinical outcome scores all improved significantly at final follow-up (mean, 36.6 months after surgery; range, 12 to 96 months; ASES, 93.3 points; JOA, 92.2 points) (P < .00001). Ninety-two patients (92%) had neither graft tear nor re-tear of the repaired rotator cuff tendon during the follow-up period (5 to 8 years of follow-up, 17 patients; 3 to 4 years of follow-up, 19 patients; 1 to 2 years of follow-up, 56 patients). Postoperative clinical outcome scores and active elevation at final follow-up were significantly better in healed patients (ASES, 95.5 points; JOA, 93.7 points, 154.8° ± 24.2°) than in unhealed patients suffering from graft tear or re-tear of the repaired rotator cuff tendon (ASES, 76.3 points, P < 0.0001; JOA, 79.5, P < 0.001; 115.0° ± 41.8°, P < 0.001). Thirty-two patients returned fully to their previous jobs, whereas two patients returned with reduced hours and workloads. All 26 patients who had played sport before their injuries returned fully to their previous sports, although most of the patients had been playing at recreational level before their injuries.
