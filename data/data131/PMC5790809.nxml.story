This observational case series identifies two patients at a single tertiary institution diagnosed with differentiation syndrome with associated ophthalmic involvement. Both patients reported bilateral reduction in visual acuity at days fourteen and ten respectively following initiation of differentiation therapy in addition to developing other systemic manifestations of differentiation syndrome. Both patients received the same chemotherapeutic regimen including both all-trans retinoic acid and arsenic trioxide as well as ten days of routine differentiation syndrome prophylaxis with oral prednisolone. Case 1 presented with bilateral pale yellow sub-retinal lesions concentrated at the posterior poles with ocular coherence tomography (OCT) evidence of bilateral multifocal areas of focal RPE elevation and adhesion to the thickened outer retina with interspersed sub-retinal fluid. Fluorescein angiography revealed areas of early hyperflouresence corresponding to the yellow chorioretinal lesions with late diffuse leakage of fluid into the subretinal space. Case 2 presented with a similar characteristic retinal findings on fundoscopy and optical coherence tomography. Both patients experienced rapid improvement in the visual symptoms and marked resolution of the sub-retinal fluid within seven to fourteen days of onset with excellent long-term visual outcome. Both patients achieved molecular remission after induction and received standard consolidation and maintenance therapy without visual disturbance.
