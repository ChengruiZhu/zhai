 as a first animal type of β-FFase encoding gene. It was hypothesized that BmSUC1 plays an important role in the silkworm-mulberry adaptation system. However, there is little information about the enzymatic core sites of BmSUC1. In this study, we mutated three amino acid residues (D63, D181, and E234) that represent important conserved motifs for β-FFase activity in GH32 to alanine respectively by using site-directed mutagenesis. Recombinant proteins of three mutants and wild type BmSUC1 were obtained by using a Bac-to-Bac/BmNPV expression system and BmN cells. Enzymatic activity, kinetic properties, and substrate specificity of the four proteins were analyzed. High Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) was used to compare the hydrolyzing and transfructosylating activities between D181A and wtBmSUC1. Our results revealed that the D63A and E234A mutations lost activity, suggesting that D63 and E234 are key amino acid residues for BmSUC1 to function as an enzyme. The D181A mutation significantly enhanced both hydrolyzing and transfructosylating activities of BmSUC1, indicating that D181 may not be directly involved in catalyzation. The results provide insight into the chemical catalyzation mechanism of BmSUC1 in
