A simple, rapid, specific and highly sensitive spectrofluorimetric method has been developed for the quantification of dabigatran etexilate mesylate in bulk and capsule dosage form. A linear relationship was found between fluorescence intensity and concentration in the range of 0.01-1.0 μg/ml in dimethyl sulphoxide as solvent at an emission wavelength of 391 nm after excitation at 334 nm, with a good correlation coefficient (0.989). The detection and quantification limits were found to be 0.005 and 0.015 μg/ml, respectively. The proposed method was applied for dabigatran etexilate mesylate capsules, results reveal with percentage recovery of 102% and percentage relative standard deviation values were found to be less than 2 for accuracy and precision studies. The proposed method was validated for linearity, range, accuracy, precision, limit of detection and quantification according to International Conference on Harmonization guidelines. Statistical analysis of the results revealed high accuracy and good precision. The suggested procedures could be used for the determination of dabigatran etexilate mesylate in bulk and capsule dosage form in quality control laboratories of industries as well as in academic institutions.
