Delayed post-pancreatectomy hemorrhage (PPH) is a relatively uncommon, but feared, complication after pancreaticoduodenectomy (PD). A splenic artery pseudoaneurysm is a rare cause of delayed PPH after a PD. This paper describes the case of a patient with PD used to treat a distal bile duct cholangiocarcinoma complicated with a clinically significant pancreatic fistula and secondary intraabdominal abscess. Computed tomography-guided drainage of the abscess was performed with an apparently favourable outcome; the patient was discharged on postoperative day (POD) 35 and the abdominal drains were removed on POD 50. On POD 80, the patient was readmitted for a severe digestive hemorrhage. Computed tomography revealed a pseudoaneurysm of the splenic artery with a subsequent hematoma formation. Immediately, an angiography was performed and coils were successfully mounted. This case illustrates the rare possibility of the development of a splenic artery pseudoaneurysm with severe delayed PPH after PD complicated with a clinically significant pancreatic fistula, even after the patient was discharged from the hospital. An interventional radiology approach represents the first treatment option in hemodynamically stable patients with high success rates.
