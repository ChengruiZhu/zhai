Twenty-two obese women with T2DM were randomly assigned to either exercise training (ET) or control (C) group. A subject dropped from ET group due to personal reasons and 1 subject dropped from C group due to commitment to experiments conditions. A total of twenty obese women with T2DM were randomly assigned into endurance exercise training (ET = 10) and control (C = 10) groups. The training group underwent a progressive endurance-training program for 10 weeks (running on a treadmill for 30–55 min/day at 50–75% heart rate reserve) and the control group did not participate in any exercise program. Venous blood samples were collected from both groups before and 72 h after the last session of exercise training for analysis of serum SP-D, leptin, lipid profile, glucose and insulin. Data were analyzed using 2 (group: control, endurance training) × 2 (time: pre, post) ANOVA with repeated measures on the second factor. Absolute changes from rest (∆ baseline) values were calculated according to the following formula: ((measure-baseline)·baseline-1)·100. Percent change between groups was analyzed using independent t-tests (p < 0.05). All analyses were completed using SPSS 19.
