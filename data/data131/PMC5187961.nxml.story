The purpose of this study was to analyze cellular immune components and their association with heart rate variability in triathlon athletes. Twelve athletes were included (age 36.41 ± 5.57 years, body mass 81.84 ± 10.97 kg) and blood samples were taken one week before, immediately, at 2 and 48 hours, and one week after competition. Total lymphocytes and their subpopulations, neutrophils, basophils, eosinophils and monocytes were analyzed. At the same time, heart rate variability was recorded for 30 minutes using Polar Team2®. A significant difference between lymphocyte subpopulations and heart rate variability was found in the different study periods. A positive correlation was found between total lymphocytes and rMSSD (r = .736, p <0.05), CD3+ and rMSSD (r = .785, p <0.05), and CD4+ and rMSSD (r = .795, p < 0.05) at the end of the competition. After one week of competition, a negative correlation was found between eosinophils and MRR, SDNN, pNN50, and rMSSD (p <0.01); and basophils and MRR, SDNN, pNN50, and rMSSD (p <0.01); while a positive correlation was found between CD19+ (B cells) and pNN50 (r = .678, p <0.05). Our results suggest that it is possible to predict the effect of training with regard to the athlete's performance.
