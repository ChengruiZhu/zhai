In 2009, the overall incidence rate of RRT for end-stage renal disease (ESRD) among all registries reporting to the ERA–EDTA Registry was 125 per million population (p.m.p.). Incidence rates varied from 259 p.m.p. in Turkey to 19 p.m.p. in Ukraine and the mean age of patients starting RRT in 2009 ranged from 47.6 years in Russia to 69.5 year in Dutch-speaking Belgium. When examining the relative change of the HD, PD and transplantation distribution (at Day 91 after the start of RRT) between 2005 and 2009, we found overall a 0.5% decrease in HD, 1.4% decrease in PD utilization and an 1.8% increase of the share of patients living on a functioning graft. The overall prevalence of RRT for ESRD as of 31 December 2009 was 730 p.m.p. The highest prevalence was reported by Portugal (1507 p.m.p.) and the lowest by Ukraine (101 p.m.p.). In Norway, 70% of the patients on RRT were living with a functioning graft (591 p.m.p.) at 31 December 2009. The number of transplants performed p.m.p. in 2009 was highest in Spain (Cantabria) (78 p.m.p.). For the cohort 2000–04, the adjusted 1-, 2- and 5-year survival of patients on RRT was 87.4% (95% confidence interval: 87.2–87.7), 78.5% (95% confidence interval: 78.2–78.8) and 56.3% (95% confidence interval: 55.9–56.7), respectively.
