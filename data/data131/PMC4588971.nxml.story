We completed a minimum follow-up on 93% (1307/1411) of our cohort at 6 years. Baseline results: 56% male, median age 23 years, 75% with non-contact injury mechanism, articular cartilage pathology (MFC-25%, LFC-20%, MTP-6%, LTP-12%, patella-20%, and trochlear-9%), and meniscal pathology (medial-38%, lateral-46%). Both articular cartilage lesions and meniscal tears significantly predicted 6 year outcomes on IKDC and KOOS (Table 1). Grade 3 or 4 articular cartilage lesions (excluding patella) significantly reduced IKDC and KOOS scores at 6 years. Figure 1 focuses on IKDC and demonstrates worse outcomeswith chondral injuries on the MFC, MTP, and LFC. Likewise, KOOS was negatively affected by cartilage injury. The sole significant predictor of reduced Marx activity was the presence of a grade 4 lesion on the MFC. Lateral meniscus repairs did not correlate with inferior results, but medial meniscus repairs predicted worse IKDC and KOOS scores. Lateral meniscus tears left alone significantly improved prognosis. Small partial meniscectomies (<33%) on medial meniscus fared worse, but conversely, larger excisions on lateral meniscus (>50%) improved prognosis. Analogous to previous studies, other significant predictors of worse outcome scores were lower baseline scores, higher BMI, lower education level, smoking, and revisions.
