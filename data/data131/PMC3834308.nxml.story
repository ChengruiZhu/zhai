p53 status is a key biomarker for a variety of cancer types. However, it remains controversial whether p53 is an effective biomarker in oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC), particularly with regard to its prognostic value for OSCC patients with combinational treatment. The aim of the current study was to evaluate the prognostic potential of p53 immunoexpression in samples from OSCC patients treated with surgery only or surgery and neoadjuvant chemotherapy. p53 expression was assessed immunohistochemically in biopsy tissues from 44 OSCC patients with a mean follow-up of 35.6 months. Correlations between p53 status, tumor size (T-classification), lymph node status (N-classification) and clinical outcome were analyzed. It was observed that p53-positive and N0 cases correlated with higher 5-year survival rates in cases treated with surgery alone (P=0.017 and P=0.03, respectively), while in cases with neoadjuvant chemotherapy, p53 status and lymph node status did not exhibit prognostic significance. Tumor size showed no prognostic value in cases receiving surgery alone or in those with neoadjuvant chemotherapy. The present results demonstrated for the first time that p53 immunohistochemical expression correlates with a good prognosis in OSCC patients receiving surgery alone. In conclusion, p53 immunohistochemical expression and lymph node status may serve as prognostic markers for the survival of OSCC patients receiving surgery only, but not for patients undergoing surgery and neoadjuvant chemotherapy treatment.
