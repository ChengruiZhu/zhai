Currently available antiretroviral drugs curtail HIV infection but fail to eradicate the virus. A strategy of intervention radically different from that employed by current drugs has been proposed by the molecular quasispecies theory. The theory predicts that increasing the viral mutation rate beyond a critical value, called the error threshold, would cause a severe loss of genetic information, potentially leading to viral clearance. Several chemical mutagens are now being developed that can increase the mutation rate of HIV-1. Their success depends on reliable estimates of the error threshold of HIV-1, which are currently lacking. The quasispecies theory cannot be applied directly to HIV-1: the theory considers an infinitely large population of asexually reproducing haploid individuals, whereas HIV-1 is diploid, undergoes recombination, and is estimated to have a small effective population size in vivo. We employed detailed stochastic simulations that overcome the limitations of the quasispecies theory and accurately mimic HIV-1 evolution in vivo. With these simulations, we estimated the error threshold of HIV-1 to be ∼2–6-fold higher than its natural mutation rate, suggesting that HIV-1 survives close to its error threshold and may be readily susceptible to mutagenic drugs.
