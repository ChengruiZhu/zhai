In science and medicine alike, one of the critical steps to understand the working of organisms is to identify how a given individual is similar or different from others. Only then can the specific features of an individual be distinguished from the general properties of that species. However, doing enough input-output experiments on a given organism to obtain a reliable description of its function (i.e., a model) can often harm the organism, or require too much time when testing perishable tissues or human subjects. We have met this challenge by demonstrating that our novel algorithm can accelerate the extraction of accurate functional models in complex tissues by continually tailoring each successive experiment to be more informative. We apply this new method to the problem of describing how the tendons of the fingers interact, which has puzzled scientists and clinicians since the time of Da Vinci. This new computational-experimental method now enables fresh research directions in biological and medical research by allowing the experimental extraction of accurate functional models with minimal damage to the organism. For example, it will allow a better understanding of similarities and differences among related species, and the development of personalized medical treatment.
