We compared rates of unintentional injury (UI) deaths (total and by injury category) among Alaska Native (AN) people to rates of U.S. White (USW) and Alaska White (AKW) populations during 2006â€“2015. The mortality data for AN and AKW populations were obtained from Alaska Bureau of Vital Statistics and USW mortality data were obtained from WISQARS, the Center for Disease Control and Prevention online injury data program. AN and AKW rates were age-adjusted to the U.S. 2000 Standard Population and rate ratios (RR) were calculated. AN people had higher age-adjusted total UI mortality than the USW (RR = 2.6) and AKW (RR = 2.3) populations. Poisoning was the leading cause of UI death among AN people (35.9 per 100,000), more than twice that of USW (RR = 2.9) and AKW (RR = 2.5). Even greater disparities were found between AN people and USW for: natural environment (RR = 20.7), transport-other land (RR = 12.4), and drowning/submersion (RR = 9.1). Rates of AN UI were markedly higher than rates for either USW or AKW. Identifying all the ways in which alcohol/drugs contribute to UI deaths would aid in prevention efforts. All transportation deaths should be integrated into one fatality rate to provide more consistent comparisons between groups.
