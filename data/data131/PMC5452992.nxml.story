Although numerous effective therapies have improved the survival rate of patients with breast cancer, a number of patients present with tumor recurrence and metastasis. A liquid biopsy of circulating tumor cells (CTC) is a non-invasive method to obtain tumor cells and may be used as substitute for a tumor tissue biopsy. The present study focuses on determining whether CTC culture is an optimal method of obtaining sufficient amounts of CTCs for molecular analysis. The current study demonstrates a method of isolating and culturing CTCs from patients with breast cancer and the construction of a molecular profile of cultured cells using the Ion AmpliSeq Cancer Gene Panel V2. Gene mutations that were observed in cultured CTCs were compared with those observed in primary tumor tissues. CTCs were isolated and cultured from the blood of six patients with breast cancer. Mutations from the Catalogue Of Somatic Mutation In Cancer (COSMIC) were detected in Platelet-Derived Growth Factor Receptor Alpha, MET (also known as Hepatocyte Growth Factor Receptor), Phosphatase and Tensin Homolog, Harvey Rat Sarcoma Viral Oncogene Homolog, SWI/SNF Related, Matrix Associated, Actin Dependent Regulator of Chromatin Subfamily B Member 1, Cyclin Dependent Kinase Inhibitor 2A and MutL Homolog 1 genes in 5/6 samples. A comparison between mutations detected in cultured CTCs and mutations detected in primary tumor tissues demonstrated that a large number of mutations that were identified in CTCs were also detected in primary tumor tissues. The results from the current study describe a novel cell culture approach that may be used to obtain an optimal number of CTCs for molecular analysis. This novel approach is able to be used as a tool for liquid biopsy during breast cancer treatment.
