Using modulation transfer functions (MTF), we investigated how sound patterns are processed within the auditory pathway of grasshoppers. Spike rates of auditory receptors and primary-like local neurons did not depend on modulation frequencies while other local and ascending neurons had lowpass, bandpass or bandstop properties. Local neurons exhibited broader dynamic ranges of their rate MTF that extended to higher modulation frequencies than those of most ascending neurons. We found no indication that a filter bank for modulation frequencies may exist in grasshoppers as has been proposed for the auditory system of mammals. The filter properties of half of the neurons changed to an allpass type with a 50% reduction of modulation depths. Contrasting to reports for mammals, the sensitivity to small modulation depths was not enhanced at higher processing stages. In ascending neurons, a focus on the range of low modulation frequencies was visible in the temporal MTFs, which describe the temporal locking of spikes to the signal envelope. To investigate the influence of stimulus rise time, we used rectangularly modulated stimuli instead of sinusoidally modulated ones. Unexpectedly, steep stimulus onsets had only small influence on the shape of MTF curves of 70% of neurons in our sample.
