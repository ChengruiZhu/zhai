Proteins are long linear polymers that must fold into complex three-dimensional shapes in order to carry out their cellular functions. Every protein is synthesized by the ribosome, which decodes each trinucleotide codon in an mRNA coding sequence in order to select the amino acid residue that will occupy each position in the protein sequence. Most amino acids can be encoded by more than one codon, but these synonymous codons are not used with equal frequency. Rare codons are associated with generally slower rates for protein synthesis, and for this reason have traditionally been considered mildly deleterious for efficient protein production. However, because synonymous codon substitutions do not change the sequence of the encoded protein, the majority view is that they merely reflect genomic ‘background noise’. To the contrary, here we show that the positions of many synonymous rare codons are conserved in mRNA sequences that encode structurally similar proteins from a diverse range of organisms. These results suggest that rare codons have a functional role related to the production of functional proteins, potentially to regulate the rate of protein synthesis and the earliest steps of protein folding, while synthesis is still underway.
