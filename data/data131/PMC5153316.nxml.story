Colorectal cancers (CRCs) exhibiting microsatellite instability (MSI) have special biological behavior. The clinical predictors for MSI and its survival relevance for the Chinese population were still unclear. Seven hundred ninety-five CRC patients were retrospectively assessed. Mismatch repair (MMR) proteins (MSH2, MSH6, PMS1, and MLH1) expression was detected by immunohistochemistry using tumor tissues of all patients. DNA MSI status was analyzed by polymerase chain reaction in 182 samples randomly selected from the 795 cases. Among all CRC tumor tissues, 97 cases (12.2%) were with an MMR protein-deficient (MMR-D) phenotype, whereas 698 cases (87.8%) were with an MMR proteins intact (MMR-I) phenotype. A total of 21 (11.5%) CRCs were identified as having high microsatellite instability, 156 (85.7%) tumors were having microsatellite stability (MSS), and five (2.7%) were having low microsatellite instability. Importantly, MMR status was demonstrated to be moderately consistent with MSI status (Îº=0.845, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.721, 0.969). Unconditional logistic regression analysis revealed age, number of lymph node, tumor diameter, and tumor site as predictors for MSI with a substantial ability to discriminate different MSI status by area under curve of 80.62% using receiver operation curve. Compared with MMR-I, MMR-D was an independent prognostic factor for longer overall survival (hazard ratio =0.340, 95% CI 0.126, 0.919;
