Most polypeptides by necessity must fold into three-dimensional structures in order to become functional proteins. Misfolding, either during or subsequent to initial folding, can result in toxic protein aggregation. As a consequence, cells have adopted a number of protein quality control pathways to prevent protein aggregation, promote protein folding, and target terminally misfolded proteins for degradation. One cause of misfolding is the presence of missense mutations, which account for over half of all the reported mutations in the Human Gene Mutation Database. Here we establish a model cytosolic protein substrate whose stability is temperature dependent. We then perform a flow cytometry based screen to identify factors that promote the degradation of our model substrate. We identified the E3 ubiquitin ligase Ubr1 and the prefoldin chaperone complex subunit Gim3. Prefoldin forms a “jellyfish-like” structure and aids in nascent protein folding and prevents protein aggregation. We show that prefoldin promotes protein degradation by maintaining substrate solubility. Our work adds to that of others highlighting the importance of the prefoldin complex in preventing potentially toxic protein aggregation.
