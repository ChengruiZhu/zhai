Kinetic features of sodium conductance (gNa) and associated gating current (Ig) were studied in voltage-clamped, internally perfused squid axons. Following a step depolarization Ig ON has several kinetic components: (a) a rapid, early phase largely preceding gNa turn-on; (b) a delayed intermediate component developing as gNa increases; and (c) a slow component continuing after gNa is fully activated. With small depolarizations the early phase shows a quick rise (less than 40 mus) and smooth decay; the slow component is not detectable. During large pulses all three components are present, and the earliest shows a rising phase or initial plateau lasting approximately 80 mus. Steady- state and kinetic features of Ig are minimally influenced by control pulse currents, provided controls are restricted to a sufficiently negative voltage range. Ig OFF following a strong brief pulse also shows a rising phase. A depolarizing prepulse producing gNa inactivation and Ig immobilization eliminates the rising phase of Ig OFF. gNa, the immobilized portion of Ig ON, and the rising phase reappear with similar time-courses when tested with a second depolarizing pulse after varying periods of repolarization. 30 mM external ZnCl2 delays and slows gNa activation, prolongs the rising phase, and slows the subsequent decay of Ig ON. Zn does not affect the kinetics of gNa tails or Ig OFF as channels close, however. We present a sequential kinetic model of Na channel activation, which adequately describes the observations. The rapid early phase of IgON is generated by a series of several fast steps, while the intermediate component reflects a subsequent step. The slow component is too slow to be clearly associated with gNa activation.
