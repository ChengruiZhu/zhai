Scapulothoracic dissociation involves varying degree of discontinuity of the upper extremity from its truncal attachment. An eighteen-year-old male presented to the accident and emergency department following a motor vehicle accident where he was hit by a four wheeler while riding a two wheeler. He had tenderness and deformity over the left clavicle and the left humerus. He was unable to perform active wrist and finger dorsiflexion. A CT subsequently revealed a grade 2 splenic laceration. The splenic laceration was treated conservatively. As his general condition improved, he was gradually weaned off the ventilator and his left upper limb neurology was reassessed. He had isolated radial nerve palsy with an otherwise intact brachial plexus. He underwent internal fixation of the clavicle and the humerus. At 4 months after injury the EMG/NCV report showed signs of renervation of the radial nerve, and the fracture progressed to an uneventful union. This prior unreported triad of scapulothoracic dissociation with ipsilateral clavicular and humeral fractures may represent a parody. An apparent increase in the severity of skeletal injury was associated with a paradoxical decrease in the severity of neurovascular injury. We report this case to create awareness among orthopedic surgeons and emergency physicians about the clinical presentation of such injuries.
