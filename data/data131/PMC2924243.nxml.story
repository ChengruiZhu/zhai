Analysis of high-content genomic data within the context of known networks of interactions of genes can lead to a better understanding of the underlying biological processes. However, finding the networks of interactions that are most relevant to the given data is a challenging task. We present a random walk-based algorithm, NetWalk, which integrates genomic data with networks of interactions between genes to score the relevance of each interaction based on both the data values of the genes as well as their local network connectivity. This results in a distribution of Edge Flux values, which can be used for dynamic reconstruction of user-defined networks. Edge Flux values can be further subjected to statistical analyses such as clustering, allowing for direct numerical comparisons of context-specific networks between different conditions. To test NetWalk performance, we carried out microarray gene expression analysis of MCF7 cells subjected to lethal and sublethal doses of a DNA damaging agent. We compared NetWalk to other network-based analysis methods and found that NetWalk was superior in identifying coherently altered sub-networks from the genomic data. Using NetWalk, we further identified p53-regulated networks that are differentially involved in cell cycle arrest and apoptosis, which we experimentally tested.
