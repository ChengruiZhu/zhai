. as long as the population increased; with the onset of a decline in numbers, the R.Q. began to drop. It is believed that the flagellates consume in the beginning predominantly sugar and later predominantly protein. Observations on the pH of the cultures bear out this view. 3. The oxygen consumption was independent of the oxygen tension over a wide range of tensions. 4. The oxygen consumption increased in the temperature range 13° to 40°C., while a temperature of 44°C. proved to be lethal. Upon application of Arrhenius' equation, two straight lines, intersecting at about 28°C., resulted. The µ values were 23,980 and 5275 for the lower and higher temperature range respectively. 5. Of the oxidase inhibitors tested, strong inhibition of the oxygen consumption was achieved with azide, cyanide, and hydrogen sulfide. Pyrophosphate had no influence at all. There is some probability that cytochrome oxidase is the chief oxidase present. 6. The strongest inhibitory influence due to dehydrogenase inhibitors was observed with propyl carbamate and high concentrations of ethyl carbamate. 7. A small fraction of the oxygen consumption, about 10 per cent, may be due to substances with sulfhydryl groups, as indicated by a slight but distinct inhibition due to dilute iodoacetate and to arsenite.
