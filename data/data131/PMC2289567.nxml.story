Mutations in the gene l(1)zw10 disrupt the accuracy of chromosome segregation in a variety of cell types during the course of Drosophila development. Cytological analysis of mutant larval brain neuroblasts shows very high levels of aneuploid cells. Many anaphase figures are aberrant, the most frequent abnormality being the presence of lagging chromosomes that remain in the vicinity of the metaphase plate when the other chromosomes have migrated toward the spindle poles. Finally, the centromeric connection between sister chromatids in mutant neuroblasts treated with colchicine often appears to be broken, in contrast with similarly treated control neuroblasts. The 85-kD protein encoded by the l(1)zw10 locus displays a dynamic pattern of localization in the course of the embryonic cell cycle. It is excluded from the nuclei during interphase, but migrates into the nuclear zone during prometaphase. At metaphase, the zw10 antigen is found in a novel filamentous structure that may be specifically associated with kinetochore microtubules. Upon anaphase onset, there is an extremely rapid redistribution of the zw10 protein to a location at or near the kinetochores of the separating chromosomes.
