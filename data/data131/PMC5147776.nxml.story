Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASDs) make up a debilitating neurodevelopmental disorder class. It has been known for a long time that more males than females are affected, but despite much speculation there is no clear etiological reason for this sex bias. As ASDs are highly heritable, we examined evidence in single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) data for five plausible genetic models that could generate sex bias. We identified distinct genome-wide significant loci in each sex-specific dataset, and evaluated support in five analyses: 1) In contrast to rare variant contribution, we find no evidence for increased SNP genetic load in females. 2) Sex-heterogeneity is demonstrated on the X-chromosome. 3) We uncover no evidence for hormone-responsive genes being overrepresented in association signals. 4) We identify no signature for genes differentially brain-expressed between males and females contributing to ASDs. 5) We observe a strong signal of excess association in the same regions of the genome showing sex-heterogeneity in anthropometric traits. This latter finding is striking, implicating general sexual dimorphism as opposed to brain- or behavior-specific origins for sex differences contributing to ASDs.
