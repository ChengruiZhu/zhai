A key challenge in cellular network biology is to understand how protein complexes are cell-type or condition-specific assembled and disassembled. Cell differentiation is a major cellular reorganization bringing about fundamental changes in the new differentiated cell type. As many genes are expressed throughout all stages and only their expression levels differ, the question arises of how specific functions can be mediated. Here, focusing on the calcium-induced differentiation of primary human keratinocytes, we describe motifs of protein complex assemblies. We found that a large proportion of complexes contain both proteins expressed at similar levels in all stages of differentiation (non-dynamically expressed) and proteins with variable expression between (dynamically expressed). Using structural information we found that subunits tend to be replaced at structural overlapping surfaces of proteins. When applying our concepts to a manually annotated large TNF/NFkB signaling complex, we find a stable core associated with both a dynamically changing module and several stable modules. We propose this as a ‘constant signalosome ready to work,’ where a stable core is associated with a dynamic periphery. Altogether, our analysis highlights the importance of understanding the dynamic assembly and disassembly of complexes, taking 3D structural information into consideration, rather than only considering networks of individual proteins.
