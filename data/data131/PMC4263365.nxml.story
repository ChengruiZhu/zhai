Protein-protein interactions are fundamental for biological function and are strongly influenced by their local environment. Cellular pH is tightly controlled and is one of the critical environmental factors that regulates protein-protein interactions. Three-dimensional structures of the protein complexes can help us understand the mechanism of the interactions. Since experimental determination of the structures of protein-protein complexes is expensive and time-consuming, computational docking algorithms are helpful to predict the structures. However, none of the current protein-protein docking algorithms account for the critical environmental pH effects. So we developed a pH-sensitive docking algorithm that can dynamically pick the favorable protonation states of the ionizable amino-acid residues. Compared to our previous standard docking algorithm, the new algorithm improves docking accuracy and generates higher-quality predictions over a large dataset of protein-protein complexes. We also use a case study to demonstrate efficacy of the algorithm in predicting a large pH-dependent binding affinity change that cannot be captured by the other methods that neglect pH effects. In principle, the approaches in the study can be used for rational design of pH-dependent protein inhibitors or industrial enzymes that are active over a wide range of pH values.
