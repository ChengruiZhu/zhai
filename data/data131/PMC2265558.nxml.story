The ability of a brain to learn has been studied at various levels. However, a large gap exists between behavioral studies of learning and memory and studies of cellular plasticity. In particular, much remains unknown about how cellular plasticity scales to affect network population dynamics. In previous studies, we have addressed this by growing mammalian brain cells in culture and creating a long-term, two-way interface between a cultured network and a robot or an artificial animal. Behavior and learning could now be observed in concert with the detailed and long-term electrophysiology. In this work, we used modeling/simulation of living cortical cultures to investigate the network's capability to learn goal-directed behavior. A biologically inspired simulated network was used to determine an effective closed-loop training algorithm, and the system successfully exhibited multi-task goal-directed adaptive behavior. The results suggest that even though lacking the characteristic layered structure of a brain, the network still could be functionally shaped and showed meaningful behavior. Knowledge gained from working with such closed-loop systems could influence the design of future artificial neural networks, more effective neuroprosthetics, and even the use of living networks themselves as a biologically based control system.
