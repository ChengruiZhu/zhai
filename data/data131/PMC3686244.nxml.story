Herein, we report a case of abrupt suprachoroidal hemorrhage (SCH) that developed during peritoneal dialysis in a patient with proliferative diabetic retinopathy. A 53-year-old female patient visited our clinic with blurred vision due to vitreous hemorrhage and proliferative diabetic retinopathy. Her medical history included diabetes, hypertension, chronic renal failure, and she had received scheduled peritoneal dialysis. No anticoagulant agents were used. We performed combined phacoemulsification with intraocular lens implantation and vitrectomy without any complications. Two hours later, the retina was stable and the intraocular pressure (IOP) was 11 mmHg. Four hours later, while receiving peritoneal dialysis, she abruptly developed ocular pain. Examination of her eye revealed an IOP of 38 mmHg and a SCH in the entire peripheral retina and posterior pole. At 12 hours after surgery (on the same day), the SCH was found to be further aggravated, and because a “kissing retina” was imminent, silicone oil was injected. An attempted fluid–air exchange failed because there was not enough space to fill with silicone oil due to aggravation of the SCH. Sclerotomies were performed to remove the SCH, and to create space for the silicone oil injection. Two months after surgery, the silicone oil was removed and her visual acuity was found to have improved to 20/40, but the patient died of pontine hemorrhage 1 month later. SCH can occur in vitrectomized eyes due to an increase in abdominal pressure during peritoneal dialysis, because chronic renal failure patients with diabetes and hypertension have structural vulnerabilities and vascular weaknesses due to arterial sclerosis in response to the increased blood pressure.
