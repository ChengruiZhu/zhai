Glioblastoma (GBM) represents the most common and lethal primary malignant brain tumor. The standard treatment for glioblastoma patients involves surgical resection with concomitant radio and chemotherapy. Despite todayâ€™s clinical protocol, the prognosis for patients remains very poor with a median survival of 15 months. Tumor resistance and recurrence is strongly correlated with a subpopulation of highly radioresistant and invasive cells termed Glioblastoma Stem Cells (GSCs). The transcription factor STAT3 has been found to be constitutively activated in different tumors including GBM and enhanced tumor radioresistance. In this study, we assessed radiosensitization of GSC lines isolated from patients by inhibition of STAT3 activation using Stattic or WP1066. We showed that inhibitor treatment before cell irradiation decreased the surviving fraction of GSCs suggesting that STAT3 inhibition could potentiate radiation effects. Finally, we investigated STAT3 activation status on 61 GBM clinical samples and found a preferential phosphorylation of STAT3 on Serine727 (pS727). Moreover, we found that pS727 was associated with a significant lower overall patient survival and progression-free survival but not pY705. Taken together, our results suggest that pS727-STAT3 could be a potential prognostic marker and could constitute a therapeutic target to sensitize highly radioresistant GSCs.
