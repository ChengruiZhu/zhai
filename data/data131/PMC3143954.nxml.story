Between January 2003 and December 2004, 13 patients underwent bilateral resurfacing arthroplasty via a Ganz trochanteric osteotomy. This bilateral group was mobilised fully weight-bearing with crutches. During the same period 139 Ganz trochanteric osteotomies were performed for unilateral hip resurfacing. These patients were mobilised with crutches, weight-bearing up to 10 kg on the operated leg. Nine osteotomies (32%) in the bilateral group subsequently developed a symptomatic non-union requiring revision of fixation. This compares with 10 patients (7%) in the unilateral group. Applying the Fisher's exact test, the difference reached significance (P=0.0004). In two patients a second revision was required to achieve union. In one patient, revision of trochanteric fixation precipitated a deep infection. Protected weight-bearing following a Ganz trochanteric osteotomy is important to the success of the procedure. Simultaneous bilateral hip arthroplasty through a Ganz approach should be avoided. If it is undertaken, we recommend that patients should be non weight-bearing for 6 weeks following surgery. Non-union following a Ganz trochanteric osteotomy for arthroplasty carries a significant morbidity.
