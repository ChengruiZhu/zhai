Lifeâ€™s vital rhythm, the heartbeat is guaranteed by specialized, cardiac pacemaker cells. Based upon the Hodgkin-Huxley membrane excitation theory and its application to cardiac cells, the cardiac pacemaker clock has been, for a long time, to be considered essentially a surface membrane oscillator, i.e. a membrane clock, driven by an ensemble of time- and voltage-dependent ion channels. More recent studies, however, discovered a tight integration of the membrane clock with an intracellular Ca oscillator (dubbed Ca clock). The Ca clock generates rhythmic, diastolic locally propagating Ca releases from sarcoplasmic reticulum, a cell major Ca store, that is refilled with Ca via a Ca pump. The released Ca activates Na/Ca exchanger that generates an inward current and accelerates the diastolic depolarization. Despite their importance, the local releases have not been systematically studied. Here we developed a new computer algorithm for automatic detection, classification, and analysis of local Ca releases generated by a recent computational model of a sinoatrial node cell. Then we investigated how the releases are regulated by the Ca pump, a major functional component of Ca clock. We discovered counterintuitive behaviors stabilizing diastolic Ca signal mass and ensuring fail-safe pacemaker operation at various pumping rates.
