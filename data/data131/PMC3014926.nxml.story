The neocortex of the mammalian brain is divided into different regions that serve specific functions. These include sensory areas for vision, hearing, and touch, and motor areas for directing aspects of movement. However, the similarities and differences in local circuit organization between these areas are not well understood. The cortex is a layered structure numbered in an outside-in fashion, such that layer 1 is closest to the cortical surface and layer 6 is deepest. Each layer harbors distinct cell types. The precise circuit wiring within and between these layers allows for specific functions performed by particular cortical regions. To directly compare circuits from distinct cortical areas, we combined optical and electrophysiological tools to map connections between layers in different brain regions. We examined three regions of mouse neocortex that are involved in active whisker sensation: vibrissal motor cortex (vM1), primary somatosensory cortex (vS1), and secondary somatosensory cortex (S2). Our results demonstrate that excitatory connections from layer 2/3 to layer 5 are prominent in all three regions. In contrast, strong ascending pathways from middle layers (layer 4) to superficial ones (layer 3) and local inputs to layer 6 were prominent only in the two sensory cortical areas. These results indicate that cortical circuits employ regional specializations when processing motor versus sensory information. Moreover, our data suggest that sensory cortices are elaborations on a basic motor cortical plan involving layer 2/3 to layer 5 pathways.
