Low-dose radiation (LDR) induces hormesis and adaptive response in normal cells but not in cancer cells, suggesting its potential protection of normal tissue against damage induced by conventional radiotherapy. However, the underlying mechanisms are not well established. We addressed this in the present study by examining the role of the ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM) signaling pathway in response to LDR using A549 human lung adenocarcinoma cells and HBE135-E6E7 (HBE) normal lung epithelial cells. We found that LDR-activated ATM was the initiating event in hormesis and adaptive response to LDR in HBE cells. ATM activation increased the expression of CDK4/CDK6/cyclin D1 by activating the AKT/glycogen synthase kinase (GSK)-3β signaling pathway, which stimulated HBE cell proliferation. Activation of ATM/AKT/GSK-3β signaling also increased nuclear accumulation of nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2, leading to increased expression of antioxidants, which mitigated cellular damage from excessive reactive oxygen species production induced by high-dose radiation. However, these effects were not observed in A549 cells. Thus, the failure to activate these pathways in A549 cells likely explains the difference between normal and cancer cells in terms of hormesis and adaptive response to LDR.
