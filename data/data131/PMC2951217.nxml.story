During breast cancer metastasis to bone, tumor cells home to bone marrow, likely targeting the stem cell niche, and stimulate osteoclasts, which mediate osteolysis required for tumor expansion. Although osteoblasts contribute to the regulation of the hematopoietic stem cell niche and control osteoclastogenesis through production of proresorptive cytokine RANKL (receptor activator of NF-κB ligand), their role in cancer metastases to bone is not fully understood. C57BL/6J mouse bone marrow cells were treated for 3–12 days with ascorbic acid (50 μg/ml) in the presence or absence of 10% medium conditioned by breast carcinoma cells MDA-MB-231, 4T1, or MCF7. Treatment with cancer-derived factors resulted in a sustained 40–60% decrease in osteoblast differentiation markers, compared with treatment with ascorbic acid alone, and induced an osteoclastogenic change in the RANKL/osteoprotegerin ratio. Importantly, exposure of bone cells to breast cancer-derived factors stimulated the subsequent attachment of cancer cells to immature osteoblasts. Inhibition of γ-secretase using pharmacological inhibitors DAPT and Compound E completely reversed cancer-induced osteoclastogenesis as well as cancer-induced enhancement of cancer cell attachment, identifying γ-secretase activity as a key mediator of these effects. Thus, we have uncovered osteoblasts as critical intermediary of premetastatic signaling by breast cancer cells and pinpointed γ-secretase as a robust target for developing therapeutics potentially capable of reducing both homing and progression of cancer metastases to bone.
