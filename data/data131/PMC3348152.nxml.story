Genetically identical cells grown in the same environment can display heterogeneity in their morphology, behavior, and composition of their cellular components. In some microorganisms, such cellular heterogeneity can underlie a phenomenon known as bet hedging because it enables some cells to survive in harsh environments, hence increasing the overall population fitness when environmental shifts are unpredictable. Bet hedging is likely to be an important strategy by which microbes infect humans and evade antimicrobial treatments, yet little is known of how cellular heterogeneity contributes to microbial survival. Here, we study the mechanisms underlying bet hedging in yeast. We find that populations of genetically identical yeast contain a broad distribution of growth rates and that slow growth predicts resistance to heat killing in a graded fashion. We identify several gene products that are likely to play a role in this bet-hedging strategy and confirm that Tsl1, a regulator of the production of the disaccharide trehalose, is an important component of acute stress resistance. Finally, we find that old age in cells correlates with a Tsl1-abundant, stress-resistant cell state. Our results suggest that trehalose synthesis is part of a complex and multifactorial mechanism that underlies bet hedging in yeast.
