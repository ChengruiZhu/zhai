Preclinical animal research is mostly based on studies conducted in a single laboratory and under highly standardized conditions. This entails the risk that the study results may only be valid under the specific conditions of the test laboratory, which may explain the poor reproducibility of preclinical animal research. To test this hypothesis, we used simulations based on 440 preclinical studies across 13 different interventions in animal models of stroke, myocardial infarction, and breast cancer and compared the reproducibility of results between single-laboratory and multi-laboratory studies. To simulate multi-laboratory studies, we combined data from multiple studies, as if several collaborating laboratories had conducted them in parallel. We found that single-laboratory studies produced large variation between study results. By contrast, multi-laboratory studies including as few as 2 to 4 laboratories produced much more consistent results, thereby increasing reproducibility without a need for larger sample sizes. Our findings demonstrate that excessive standardization is a source of poor reproducibility because it ignores biologically meaningful variation. We conclude that multi-laboratory studies—and potentially other ways of creating more heterogeneous study samples—provide an effective means of improving the reproducibility of study results, which is crucial to prevent wasting animals and resources for inconclusive research.
