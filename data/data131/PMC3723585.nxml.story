There is an astonishing amount of variation in the number of mRNA and protein molecules generated from particular genes between genetically identical single cells grown in the same environment. Particularly for mRNA, the large variation seen from these “noisy” genes is consistent with the idea of transcriptional bursting where transcription occurs in random, intermittent periods of high activity. There is considerable experimental support for transcriptional bursting, and it is a primary feature of stochastic models of gene expression that account for variation. Still, it has long been recognized that variation, especially in protein levels, can occur because of global differences between genetically identical cells. We show that in budding yeast, mRNA variation is driven to a large extent by differences in the transcriptional activity of a noisy gene between different phases of the cell cycle. These differences are not because of specific cell-cycle regulation, and in some cases transcription appears restricted to certain phases, leading to pulses of mRNA production. These results raise new questions about the origins of transcriptional bursting and how the statistics of gene expression are regulated in a global way by the cell cycle.
