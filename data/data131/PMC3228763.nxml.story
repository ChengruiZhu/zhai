We investigate the average stem cell driven dynamics of cell counts in an abstract multi compartment model. Within this framework one can represent different tissue structures, as for example hematopoiesis, the skin or the colonic crypt. Our analysis is based on an individual cell model in which cells can differentiate, reproduce or die. We give closed solutions to the corresponding system of coupled differential equations, that describe the average dynamics of all cell types. There are three cases of interest: (i) Mutations at the stem cell level, (ii) Mutations in downstream compartments associated with more mature, non stem cell types, (iii) Mutations in downstream compartments with cells acquiring stem cell like properties. The average dynamics shows for (i) and (iii) an increase of mutants towards an equilibrium, in case (ii) the average mutant cell count goes through a maximum, but mutants die out in the long run. We calculate the corresponding extinction times for every compartment. We discuss applications to hematopoietic diseases such as, PIG-A mutant cells or the classic oncogene BCR-ABL. Although the abstract model is a simplified sketch of cell differentiation, it is capable of describing many aspects of a wide variety of such tissues and associated diseases.
