Myoferlin is a protein that is associated with cellular repair following injury. The expression of myoferlin in breast cancer and pancreatic adenocarcinoma has been reported to correlate with tumor invasiveness, epithelial to mesenchymal transition and an adverse prognosis. In the present study, myoferlin expression was investigated in non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC), along with its association with patient prognosis and the expression of a number of other proteins. A total of 148 patients exhibiting NSCLC were enrolled in the present study. The survival data of all patients was examined, and myoferlin, vascular endothelial growth factor receptor-2 (VEGFR-2), epidermal growth factor receptor, E-cadherin, Î²-catenin, thyroid transcription factor-1 and tumor protein p63 expression was investigated via immunohistochemical staining of tissue microarrays. Myoferlin expression was detected in the cytoplasm of 75/148 (50.7%) of the NSCLC cases. In the adenocarcinoma cases, myoferlin-positive patients possessed a poorer prognosis (odds ratio, 2.94; P=0.339). In the squamous cell carcinoma cases, myoferlin expression was significantly associated with VEGFR-2 expression (P=0.001). Immunohistochemical staining for VEGFR-2 and myoferlin expression indicated similar features and cytoplasmic staining in tumor cells. As VEGFR-2 is a significant target for novel anticancer therapies, it is anticipated that myoferlin may also possess the potential to become a novel clinical target for the treatment of NSCLC.
