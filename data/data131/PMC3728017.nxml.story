 T cells into Th1 and Th2 lineages under mixed-input conditions, at the single cell level. We reveal that cell state is not restricted to a small number of well-defined phenotypes, but rather tunes through a continuum of mixed-phenotype states in which levels of lineage-specifying transcription factors gradually change with the levels of the two inputs. Using mathematical modeling we establish the conditions under which the system has one stable steady state that continuously tunes in response to changes in levels of the inputs. Results of this model qualitatively explain our experimental observations. We further characterize expression patterns of downstream lineage-specific genesâ€”cytokines that are driven by the two master regulators upon cell re-stimulation. We find a highly heterogeneous population with cells expressing either one of the cytokines, both cytokines, or neither. Of note, the fraction of cells in these subpopulations continuously tunes with input levels, thus reproducing a tunable state at the cell population level. Our results can be explained by a two-stage scheme in which the gene regulatory network is responsible for a continuously tunable cell state, which is translated into a heterogeneous cytokine expression pattern through uncorrelated and biased stochastic processes.
