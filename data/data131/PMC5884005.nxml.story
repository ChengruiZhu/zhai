This review article proposes a model of integrative care for cardiovascular patients in institutional settings. We review relevant historic and contemporary examples of medical–chiropractic cooperation and a brief review of the literature illustrating the clinical benefits of chiropractic care for patients with cardiovascular disease. The groundwork proposes a distinct research and clinical practice model incorporating the doctor of chiropractic (D.C.) as a synergistic partner with the medical cardiologist coined the Kaleidoscope Model of Integrative Care (KM). While a traditional kaleidoscope does not alter the nature of light itself, the observer does see the ‘raw data’ of colors and shapes, wavelengths, etc. contained within the “potential” of the light itself; left unrecognized, even subtle re-orientations of the instrument changes the perspective. Similarly, the KM is intended as a conduit for slight reorientations to traditional medical–chiropractic–patient hierarchies, thus creating new treatment options and generating robust changes in inter-professional perception of the patient's condition(s) and treatment options. It is hoped that this model will not only serve future patients within hospitals, but that institutions will serve as incubators for better collaboration and research among the majority of free-standing medical and chiropractic practices ultimately benefitting the patient with cardiovascular disease.
