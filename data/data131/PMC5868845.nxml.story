The mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) protein kinase is a master regulator of cell growth, which senses several extracellular signals, such as growth factors and nutrient levels, to coordinate cell metabolism. The activation of mTORC1 by amino acids requires many proteins such as Rag GTPase, GATOR, and Ragulator. However, how cells negatively regulate amino acid signaling remains largely unknown. In this study, we revealed that an endocytosis-related protein called Girdin negatively regulates amino acid–induced mTORC1 activation via the formation of a complex with 4F2 heavy chain (4F2hc), a subunit of multiple amino acid transporters. We show that Girdin/4F2h complex formation requires growth factor-induced Girdin phosphorylation and amino acid–induced 4F2hc ubiquitination. We also find that the complex promotes the internalization of 4F2hc from the plasma membrane to the lysosomes. The subsequent decrease of 4F2hc in the cell surface results in a lower cytoplasmic glutamine and leucine content, which then down-regulates amino acid–induced mTORC1 activation. These findings uncover the mechanism underlying negative regulation of mTORC1 signaling, which may play a role in tightly regulated cell growth and metabolism.
