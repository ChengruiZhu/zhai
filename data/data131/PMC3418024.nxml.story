Mitrofanoff appendicovesicostomy has been the method of choice for dealing with urinary incontinence. However, there may be some cases where some alternate conduits have to be used. Yang-Monti ileovesicostomy is an alternative to Mitrofanoff appendicovesicostomy. Three boys who underwent successful Yang-Monti continent ileovesicostomy are reported in this manuscript. In the first case, Mitrofanoff procedure was done for traumatic anorectal and urethral disruption after attempting ureterosigmoidostomy. Later on, on the request of the patient the appendicovesicostomy was excised. The patient presented later with chronic renal failure and bilateral hydroureteronephrosis thus an ileovesicostomy was fashioned. The patient could not be survived due to chronic renal failure related complications. In the second patient with exstrophy of bladder, the ileocecal junction along with appendix had to be resected on account of strangulated inguinal hernia; later on, an ileovesicostomy was performed for small capacity bladder and major degree of vesicoureteric reflux. The third patient with exstrophy of bladder, in whom Mitrofanoff procedure had been performed, presented with stenosis of the appendicovesicostomy. On re-operation the entire channel had disappeared thus necessitated ileovesicostomy. Both of these patients were doing well on follow-up.
