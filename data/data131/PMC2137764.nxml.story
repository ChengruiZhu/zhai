DNA label in the dividing lymph node cell population. This suggests that the loss of radioactivity from the dividing cells and from the small cell population as a whole occurs equally. This pattern prevails regardless of whether the percentage of large and small cells is altered experimentally. These findings can be explained by an interchange of the DNA nuclear label between small lymphocytes and large lymphocytes. This could occur by some process such as phagocytosis or pinocytosis, or by transformation of the small lymphocyte into a large, dividing cell. The data fit best with the latter possibility. All or any of these mechanisms would lead to an equilibration of the DNA label between large and small cells. This finding prevents the assignment of a finite life span to lymphocytes on the basis of DNA labeling kinetics. Nevertheless, there appear to be at least two different types of lymphocytes. One, the "thymus-type" lymphocyte, is found in the thymus cortex, bone marrow and germinal centers of lymphoid follicles. The other type, found abundantly in the widespread peripheral lymphatic tissue, shows a very prolonged retention of DNA label and is believed to be the recirculating, "immunologically committed" cells described by others. These cells do not appear to enter the thymus cortex.
