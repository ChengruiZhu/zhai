The majority of the respondents were male (69.2%) and more than half (53.3%) were from the age group of 25–39 years (mean: 31.08, SD: ±9.82). Nearly two-thirds (61.3%) of the respondents had a ‘poor knowledge’, and the remaining had ‘some knowledge’, about AI. More than half (55.4%) of the respondents were in the category of displaying ‘poor practice’ towards AI and the remaining half were in the ‘satisfactory practice’ category. None of the respondents had ‘adequate knowledge’ or displayed ‘good practice’. The respondents in the >25 years of age group were less likely [OR 0.169; 95% CI (0.056-0.512)] compared to those in the <25 years age group to have a poor knowledge about AI; and the respondents with ‘primary education’ were more likely [OR 3.265; 95% CI (1.326-8.189)] to have a poor knowledge about AI as compared to those who had a secondary or above level of education. Respondents who did not know the correct definition of AI were more likely to follow poor practices [OR 4.265; 95% CI (1.193-15.242)]; and the respondents who did not know the risk groups associated with AI were also more likely to follow poor practices [OR 3.103; 95% CI (1.191-8.083)].
