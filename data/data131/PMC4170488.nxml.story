The optimization of cell culture conditions for growth and productivity of recombinant Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells is a critical step in biopharmaceutical manufacturing. In the present study, the effects of the timing and amount of peptone feeding of a recombinant CHO cell line grown in a basal medium in serum-free suspension culture were determined for eight peptones of different origin (plant and casein). The amino acid content and the average molecular weight of the peptones chosen were available. In optimized feeding strategies with single peptones, increase 100 % volumetric productivity and 40 % in cell number were achieved. In feeding strategies with two peptones, several combinations stimulated protein productivity more than either peptone alone, depending on the peptone concentration and time of feeding. Some peptones, which did not stimulate productivity when added alone proved to be effective when used in combination. The combined peptones feeding strategies were more effective with peptones of different origin. Our data support the notion that the origin of peptones provides some guidance in identifying the most effective feeding strategies for recombinant CHO cells.
