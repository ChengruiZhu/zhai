No subject complained of pain on injection with PHAX, whereas 8 of the 12 subjects given propofol did. Nine PHAX and 8 propofol subjects reached BIS values of ≤50: median (interquartile range [IQR]) mg/kg dose = 0.5 (0.5–0.6) for PHAX and 2.9 (2.4–3.0) for propofol. The lowest median BIS reached was 27 to 28 for both agents with no significant differences between them for timing of onset and recovery of BIS. The concomitant median changes in systolic and diastolic blood pressures were −11% vs −19% for systolic and −25% vs −37% for diastolic in PHAX- and propofol-treated subjects, respectively. Nine of the 12 propofol-treated subjects and none of 12 PHAX-treated subjects required airway support. For subjects reaching an equivalent BIS of ≤50: a Richmond Agitation and Sedation Scale score of 0 was reached at a median of 5 (IQR, 5–10) and 15 (IQR, 10–20) minutes after PHAX and propofol, respectively; BIS returned to 90 at a mean of 21 (SD, 10.1) and 21 (SD, 9.2) minutes after PHAX and propofol, respectively; and Digit Symbol Substitution Test scores returned to predrug injection values at median of 50 (IQR, 35–72.5) and 42.5 (IQR, 35–76.3) minutes after PHAX and propofol, respectively. There was no increase in C3 and C4 complement fractions after either drug.
