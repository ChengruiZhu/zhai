 A method for the isolation of the Golgi apparatus from stem tissues of onion is described. Preparations that consisted mainly of morphologically identifiable Golgi apparatus have been obtained. The best preparations were obtained from tissue homogenized under conditions of minimum shear, and in the presence of sucrose and certain additives which aid in preservation of the integrity of the Golgi membranes. Those additives, which had a pronounced stabilizing effect on the isolated apparatus, included both monovalent and divalent ions (sodium and calcium) and dextran. A large portion of the Golgi apparatus did not appear to change microscopic appearance upon isolation, but were observed to fuse into large aggregate structures not unlike those occurring naturally in certain animal or insect cells (12). Fusion occurred both at the edges of the cisternae and in register, but the integrity of the individual cisternae was not destroyed. The major contaminants of the Golgi apparatus fraction were numerous small and large spherical vesicles. At least some of these vesicles appeared to have been derived from the Golgi apparatus; others may have been fragments of the cell membrane, the endoplasmic reticulum, or other cell debris. By utilizing this procedure, it has been possible to obtain fractions of Golgi apparatus from plant tissues other than onion stem. However, at the present time it is only with onion that the Golgi apparatus has been isolated in a form that would warrant further purification for biochemical analysis.
