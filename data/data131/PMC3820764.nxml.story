A basal network of gene regulation orchestrates the processes ensuring maintenance of genome integrity. Eukaryotic small RNAs generated by the RNAse-III Dicer have emerged as central players in this network, by mediating gene silencing at the transcriptional or post-transcriptional level via RNA interference (RNAi). To gain insight into their potential developmental functions in mammals, we have characterized small RNA expression profiles during mouse Embryonic Stem Cell (mESCs) differentiation, a model for early mammalian development. Long interspersed elements 1 (L1) are non-long-terminal-repeat retrotransposons that dominate the mouse genomic landscape, and are expressed in germ cells or during early development and mESCs. Based on clear precedents in plants and fission yeast, we investigated a role for RNAi and other RNA-based pathways in the regulation of L1 transcription and mobilization. Our work uncovered the existence of small (s)RNAs that map to active L1 elements. Some have characteristics of cognate siRNA produced by Dicer, while others display strand biases and length heterogeneity that evoke their biogenesis through RNA surveillance pathways, in a Dicer-independent manner. Furthermore, genetic ablation of DICER or of ARGONAUTE proteins has complex and profound consequences on L1 transcription and mobilization, indicating that endogenous RNAi do indeed maintain genomic integrity against L1 proliferation.
