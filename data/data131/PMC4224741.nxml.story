The role of adaptive immune system in regulation of asthmatic responses remains elusive. Here, we performed a comprehensive time-course analysis of mutual relationships between development of asthmatic response following allergen challenge and changes in several CD4+ T cell subsets which we characterized as either releasing interleukin-10 (CD4+CD25−CD127− and CD4+CD25+CD127+ T cells) or responding to IL-10 (CD4+ T cell subsets expressing CD210). Patients that developed asthmatic reaction were described as responders (R) whereas the others were named non-responders (NR). In R, in contrast to NR, at 6 h, we demonstrated significant expansion of CD4+CD25−CD127− T cells which was followed by drop to baseline values at 24 h. In contrast, in R, we observed decrease in numbers of CD4+CD25+CD127+ and CD4+CD25−CD127+ T cells at 24 h. Interestingly, at baseline, despite comparable IL-10 levels, R presented with lower levels of all CD4+ T cell subsets expressing CD210. In R, the numbers of CD4+CD210+ T cell subsets were further decreased following bronchial challenge which was paralleled by decrease in IL-10 serum levels. Altogether, our data suggest that dynamic interactions between IL-10-producing and IL-10-responding CD4+ T cells could contribute to pathogenesis of asthmatic responses in atopic individuals.
