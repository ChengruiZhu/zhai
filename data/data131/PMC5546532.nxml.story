Angiogenesis is crucial for tumor growth and metastasis. Cadmium (Cd) exposure is associated with elevated cancer risk and mortality. Such association is, at least in part, attributable to Cd-induced tumor angiogenesis. Nevertheless, the reported effects of Cd on tumor angiogenesis appear to be either stimulatory or inhibitory, depending on the concentrations. Ultra-low concentrations of Cd (<0.5 μM) inhibit endothelial nitric oxide synthase activation, leading to reduced endothelial nitric oxide production and attenuated tumor angiogenesis. In contrast, low-lose Cd (1-10 μM) up-regulates vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-mediated tumor angiogenesis by exerting sub-apoptotic levels of oxidative stress on both tumor cells and endothelial cells (ECs). The consequent activation of protein kinase B/Akt, nuclear factor-κB, and mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling cascades mediate the increased secretion of VEGF by tumor cells and the up-regulated VEGF receptor-2 expression in ECs. Furthermore, Cd in high concentrations (>10 μM) induces EC apoptosis via the activation of caspase-3, resulting in destruction of tumor vasculature. In this review, we summarize the current knowledge concerning the roles of Cd in tumor angiogenesis, with a focus on molecular mechanisms underlying the dose dependent effects of Cd on various EC phenotypes.
