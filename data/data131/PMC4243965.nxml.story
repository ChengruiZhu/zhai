, a gene encoding a putative lysosomal trafficking protein. In the majority of patients, this disorder is typically characterized by infantile-onset hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH), which is lethal unless allogeneic transplantation is performed. A small number of individuals have the attenuated form of the disease and do not benefit from transplant. Improved outcomes of transplantation have been reported when performed before the development of HLH, thus it is important to quickly differentiate patients that present with the childhood form of disease and to prematurely enroll them into a transplantation protocol. In addition, this would also preclude those that exhibit clinical phenotypes of adolescent and adult CHS from this treatment. Patients with an absence of cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) function have a high risk for developing HLH, and could therefore benefit the most from early hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). However, although normal CTL cytotoxicity or bi-allelic missense mutations do not exclude the occurrence of HLH in childhood, a more conservative approach is justified. This article summarizes recent advances in the clinical characterization of CHS patients, provides updates on promising new testing methods, and focuses on specific therapeutic approaches.
