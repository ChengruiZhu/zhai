β) gene in breast cancer and its relevance in neoadjuvant therapy. In total, 120 breast cancer patients who were hospitalized in the Departments of Breast Disease and Medical Oncology served as the subjects of this study. The subjects were diagnosed with breast cancer phase II to phase IIIA, as confirmed by aspiration biopsy and iconography. The patients were divided into two groups in a randomized control manner, with 60 patients in each group. The experimental group was administered the taxotere + epirubicin + cyclophosphamide (TEC) plan for 3–4 cycles of chemotherapy before the modified radical operation of breast cancer. In the control group, no TEC chemotherapy was carried out prior to operation. Instead, the breast lesion was removed directly by operation. After the operation, the IHC method was used to stain the ERβ protein in the lesion tissue. The patients were classified according to whether the basement membrane was broken through; 5 cases had non-infiltrative carcinoma and 115 cases had infiltrative carcinoma. According to the pathology of the lesion, 114 cases had breast ductal carcinoma, 2 cases had mucinous breast carcinoma (of which there were 2 cases combined with ductal carcinoma), and 4 cases had breast lobular carcinoma.
