Using the yeast two-hybrid system and an in vitro binding assay, we have identified a novel protein termed vinexin as a vinculin-binding protein. By Northern blotting, we identified two types of vinexin mRNA that were 3 and 2 kb in length. Screening for full-length cDNA clones and sequencing indicated that the two mRNA encode 82- and 37-kD polypeptides termed vinexin α and β, respectively. Both forms of vinexin share a common carboxyl-terminal sequence containing three SH3 domains. The larger vinexin α contains an additional amino-terminal sequence. The interaction between vinexin and vinculin was mediated by two SH3 domains of vinexin and the proline-rich region of vinculin. When expressed, vinexin α and β localized to focal adhesions in NIH 3T3 fibroblasts, and to cell–cell junctions in epithelial LLC-PK1 cells. Furthermore, expression of vinexin increased focal adhesion size. Vinexin α also promoted upregulation of actin stress fiber formation. In addition, cell lines stably expressing vinexin β showed enhanced cell spreading on fibronectin. These data identify vinexin as a novel focal adhesion and cell– cell adhesion protein that binds via SH3 domains to the hinge region of vinculin, which can enhance actin cytoskeletal organization and cell spreading.
