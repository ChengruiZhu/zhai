 osteoclasts generated from monocytes on plastic; an effect not seen with early blasts and myeloid blasts. This inhibitory effect could not be prevented by other cytokines such as IL‐1β or IL‐6. When monocytes were pre‐cultured with M‐CSF and RANKL followed by exposure to TNF‐α, a stimulatory effect was found. TNF‐α also stimulated monocytes’ osteoclastogenesis when the cells were seeded on bone. Gene expression analysis showed that when TNF‐α was added to monocytes cultured on plastic, RANK, NFATc1, and TRAcP were significantly down‐regulated while TNF‐αR1 and TNF‐αR2 were up‐regulated. FACS analysis showed a decreased uptake of fluorescently labeled RANKL in monocyte cultures in the presence of TNF‐α, indicating an altered ratio of bound‐RANK/unbound‐RANK. Our findings suggest a diverse role of TNF‐α on monocytes’ osteoclastogenesis: it affects the RANK‐signaling pathway therefore inhibits osteoclastogenesis when added at the onset of monocyte culturing. This can be prevented when monocytes were pre‐cultured with M‐CSF and RANKL, which ensures the binding of RANKL to RANK. This could be a mechanism to prevent unfavorable monocyte‐derived osteoclast formation away from the bone.
