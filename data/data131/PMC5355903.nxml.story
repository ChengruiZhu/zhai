Control
over the morphology of the active layer of bulk heterojunction
(BHJ) organic solar cells is paramount to achieve high-efficiency
devices. However, no method currently available can predict morphologies
for a novel donor–acceptor blend. An approach which allows
reaching relevant length scales, retaining chemical specificity, and
mimicking experimental fabrication conditions, and which is suited
for high-throughput schemes has been proven challenging to find. Here,
we propose a method to generate atom-resolved morphologies of BHJs
which conforms to these requirements. Coarse-grain (CG) molecular
dynamics simulations are employed to simulate the large-scale morphological
organization during solution-processing. The use of CG models which
retain chemical specificity translates into a direct path to the rational
design of donor and acceptor compounds which differ only slightly
in chemical nature. Finally, the direct retrieval of fully atomistic
detail is possible through backmapping, opening the way for improved
quantum mechanical calculations addressing the charge separation mechanism.
The method is illustrated for the poly(3-hexyl-thiophene) (P3HT)–phenyl-C61-butyric
acid methyl ester (PCBM) mixture, and found to predict morphologies
in agreement with experimental data. The effect of drying rate, P3HT
molecular weight, and thermal annealing are investigated extensively,
resulting in trends mimicking experimental findings. The proposed
methodology can help reduce the parameter space which has to be explored
before obtaining optimal morphologies not only for BHJ solar cells
but also for any other solution-processed soft matter device.
