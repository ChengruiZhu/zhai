Total cholesterol (TC) and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) levels were reduced in every group compared to baseline: statin + ezetimibe: −30.0% and −55.5%; statin + policosanol: −31.1% and −51.2%; statin + fibrates: −23.7% and −44.6%; statin + niacin: −25.2% and −43.0%; and niacin + fibrates: −11.3% and −23.5%. The target achievement rates of LDL-C all exceeded 50%, except in niacin + fibrates (42.0%); statin + ezetimibe: 57.0%; statin + policosanol: 56.0%; statin + niacin: 52.0%; and statin + fibrates: 50.0%. However, overall, the niacin + fibrates group was the most effective in decreasing triglyceride (TG) and increasing high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) as follows: niacin + fibrates: −39.3% and 28.6%; statin + fibrates: −29.3% and 18.4%; statin + niacin: −18.5% and 16.7%; statin + ezetimibe: −17.1% and 7.1%; and statin + policosanol: −15.6% and 9.5%. The achievement rates of TG and HDL-C levels in niacin + fibrates (58.0% and 39.0%) were better than the other four groups: statin + niacin (34.0% and 34.0%), statin + fibrates (43.0% and 28.0%), statin + policosanol (30.0% and 24.0%) and statin + ezetimibe (28.0% and 25.0%). Patients in all five groups experiencing drug adverse events were only 2% and no severe adverse events occurred.
