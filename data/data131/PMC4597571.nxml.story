There were 130 patients with a mean age of 35.6 (sd 11.7) years and 42.3% were male. The MCID for the mHHS at 3, 6, and 12 months was 13.0, 9.0, and 20.0, respectively. For the HOS (ADL), the MCID was 14.7, 15.0, and 23.0 at 3, 6, and 12 months. For the HOS (Sports), MCID values at 3, 6, and 12 months were 25, 28, and 47. In regards to the PASS, the observed values at 1 year following surgery were as follows: mHHS 84, HOS (ADL) 98, HOS (Sport) 94. The high values observed for the PASS across the different subscales suggests a high proportion of ceiling effects with the mHHS and HOS in this population. The MCID was significantly greater at 1 year for patients with an initial ‘low’ baseline score compared to patients with a ‘high’ baseline score. The PASS was not affected by baseline scores across different instruments. Patients with lower baseline scores were less likely to achieve the MCID one year following surgical intervention [mHHS - OR 0.28; HOS (ADL) - OR 0.23; HOS (Sports) - OR 0.06] yet more likely to achieve the PASS [mHHS - OR 3.36; HOS (ADL) - OR 3.83; HOS (Sports) - OR 3.38). There was a significant negative correlation between increasing age and the ability to obtain a mHHS or HOS above the PASS threshold (p<0.05). Age and sex were not significantly related to the odds of achieving the MCID for the mHHS or HOS.
