The formation of memory CD8 T cells is an important goal of vaccination. However, although widespread use of booster immunizations in humans generates secondary and tertiary CD8 T cell memory, experimental data are limited to primary CD8 T cell memory. Here, we show that, compared with primary memory CD8 T cells, secondary memory CD8 T cells exhibit substantially delayed conversion to a central–memory phenotype, as determined by CD62L expression and interleukin (IL)-2 production. This delayed conversion to a central–memory phenotype correlates with reduced basal proliferation and responsiveness to IL-15, although in vitro coculture with a high concentration of IL-15 is capable of inducing proliferation and CD62L upregulation. Functionally, secondary memory CD8 T cells are more protective in vivo on a per cell basis, and this may be explained by sustained lytic ability. Additionally, secondary memory CD8 T cells are more permissive than primary memory CD8 T cells for new T cell priming in lymph nodes, possibly suggesting a mechanism of replacement for memory T cells. Thus, primary and secondary memory CD8 T cells are functionally distinct, and the number of encounters with antigen influences memory CD8 T cell function.
