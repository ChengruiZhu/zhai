Proteins comprise individual folding units known as domains, with a significant proportion containing two or more (multidomain structures). Each domain is thought to represent a unit of evolution and adopts a specific fold. Detecting domains is often the first step in classifying proteins into evolutionary families for studying the relationship between sequence, structure, and function. Automatically identifying domains from structural data is problematic due to the fact that domains vary substantially in their compactness and geometric separation from one another in the whole protein. We present a novel method, CATHEDRAL, which iteratively identifies each domain by comparing a query structure against a library of manually verified domains in the CATH domain database through computational structure comparison. We find that CATHEDRAL is able to outperform the majority of popular structure comparison methods for finding structural relatives. Furthermore, it is able to accurately identify domain boundaries and outperform other methods of structure-based domain prediction for the majority of proteins. CATHEDRAL is available as a Webserver to provide domain annotations for the community and hence aid in structural and functional characterisation of newly solved protein structures.
