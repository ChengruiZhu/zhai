Bacteria readily adapt to their environments and can develop ways to survive and grow in the presence of antibiotics. While many studies have investigated how bacteria evolve to become resistant to single drugs, it is unclear how adaptation to other drugs and environments in the past affect the way bacteria adapt to new drugs and environments. In this study, we allowed bacteria in a laboratory setting to adapt to three different antibiotics. We first exposed wild-type susceptible bacteria to high concentrations of the three antibiotics individually and then exposed these populations to each of the other drugs. By tracking the levels of resistance to all three drugs in all of the treatments, we identified cases in which past adaptation to one treatment influenced subsequent evolutionary dynamics with regard to both phenotypes (levels of resistance) and genotypes (genes that became mutated). Additionally, by allowing bacterial isolates originating from human patients to adapt to the three drugs, we recapitulated a subset of the adaptation history-dependent evolutionary dynamics. Overall, this study sheds light on how adaptation history in bacteria can potentiate or constrain the rise of multidrug resistance, depending on the particular order of drugs used in a sequential therapy.
