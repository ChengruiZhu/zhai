Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common neurodegenerative disease in the elderly population. Despite significant advancements in understanding the genetic and molecular basis of AD, the pathology still lacks treatments that can slow down or reverse the progression of cognitive deterioration. Recently, the relationship between nutrient deficiency and dementia onset has been highlighted. AD is in fact a multifactorial pathology, so that a multi-target approach using combinations of micronutrients and drugs could have beneficial effects on cognitive function in neurodegenerative brain disorders leading to synaptic degeneration. Primarily, this review examines the most recent literature regarding the effects of nutrition on the risk/progression of the disease, focusing attention mostly on antioxidants agents, polyunsaturated fatty acids and metals. Secondly, it aims to figure out if nutritional supplements might have beneficial effects on drug therapy outcome. Even if nutritional supplements showed contrasting evidence of a likely effect of decreasing the risk of AD onset that could be studied more deeply in other clinical trials, no convincing data are present about their usefulness in combination with drug therapies and their effectiveness in slowing down the disease progression.
