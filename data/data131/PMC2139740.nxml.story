 Using immunodiffusion methods it has been shown that purified hemagglutinin (HA) extracted from two related strains of influenza A viruses (A/PR8/34 and A/FM1/47) have two distinct antigenic determinants, or groups of determinants. One determinant is cross-reactive while the other is strain-specific. Antisera raised in normal mice against HA were shown to contain two populations of antibody molecules, each directed against one of the determinants. Immunization of thymus-deprived (TXBM) mice showed a strong thymus dependence of antibody formation to HA. However, the thymus dependence of antibody formation against the cross-reactive determinant could be overcome by repeated inoculations of HA in TXBM mice, indicating a different handling of two portions of the same molecule by the immunological system. Strong, secondary-type responses to the strain-specific determinant were observed in primed thymus-deprived mice after reconstitution with virgin thymus cells, showing that specific immunological memory was elicited by this determinant despite the absence of detectable antibody secretion. These findings are interpreted as examples of immunological recognition and memory mediated by B lymphocytes and discussed in terms of mechanisms of T and B lymphocyte co-operation. It is suggested that the helper effect of T lymphocytes is exerted at a late stage in the differentiation of specific populations of B cells into antibody-secreting cells.
