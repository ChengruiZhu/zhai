To eliminate the potential for infection, many tissue banks routinely process and terminally sterilize allografts prior to transplantation. A number of techniques, including the use of scanning electron microscopy, bone graft models, and mechanical property tests, are used to evaluate the properties of allograft bone. However, as these methods are time consuming and often destroy the bone sample, the quality assessment of allograft bones are not routinely performed after processing and sterilization procedures. Raman spectroscopy is a non-destructive, rapid analysis technique that requires only small sample volumes and has recently been used to evaluate the mineral content, mineral crystallinity, acid phosphate and carbonate contents, and collagen maturity in human and animal bones. Here, to establish a quality assessment method of allograft bones using Raman spectroscopy, the effect of several common sterilization and preservation procedures on rat femoral bones were investigated. We found that freezeâ€“thawing had no detectable effects on the composition of bone minerals or matrix, although heat treatment and gamma irradiation resulted in altered Raman spectra. Our findings suggest Raman spectroscopy may facilitate the quality control of allograft bone after processing and sterilization procedures.
