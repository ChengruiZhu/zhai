Cell assemblies (sequences of neuronal activations), seem to represent a functional unit of information processing. However, it remains unclear how groups of neurons may organize their activity during information processing, working as a sole functional unit. One prominent principle in complex network theory is covered by small-world networks, in which each node is easily reachable by each other and organized in highly dense clusters. Small-world networks have been already observed on large scales in human and primate brain areas while their presence at the neuronal level remains unclear. The aim of this work was to investigate the possibility that functional, related neural populations, encompassing multiple brain regions, could be organized in small-world networks. We investigated the coherent neuronal activity among multiple rat brain regions involved in somatosensory information processing. We found that the recorded neuronal populations represented small-world networks and that these topologies were maintained during stimulations. Furthermore, by using simulations to explore the hidden substrates supporting the observed topological features, we inferred that small-world networks represent a plausible topology for cell assemblies. This work suggests that the coherent activity of neurons from multiple brain areas promotes the integration of local computations, the functional principle of small-world networks.
