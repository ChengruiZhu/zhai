, prepared by cutting up the worms in isotonic salt solution and incubating the suspension at room temperature. These very definite and clear-cut results outweigh any objections which may be raised against the use of turkeys which had been in earlier experiments and which came through such experiments without any signs of disease, or which came from control flocks in which spontaneous cases had occurred. The short time elapsing between feeding embryonated eggs and the first signs of disease made these experiments unusually impressive. It should be stated, furthermore, that from a precise individual record of all turkeys it was possible to select birds from control flocks in which the infection had either not appeared or was very low. All but two turkeys in flocks serving as sources of this material were killed at the close of the year. None at any time had shown symptoms of disease, and no scars or other abnormalities of ceca and liver were found. Furthermore, all other control birds and those in field experiments, with the exception of two reserved for breeding, were likewise killed. As a result of these autopsies, it was determined that of all birds in which symptoms of disease had not been recorded during life, none showed abnormalities or scars at autopsy. The protozoan factor in blackhead was probably disseminated when the first spontaneous cases occurred in the stock, unless it was present and made invasive by incubation in the cultures fed. This latter theory seems at present not acceptable because of the wholly negative outcome of Experiment 8. The production of acute blackhead by feeding embryonated eggs to turkeys in whose ceca adults of
