Many disease-associated mutations do not change the protein sequence of genes; instead they change the instructions on how a gene's mRNA transcript should be processed. Translating these instructions allows us to better understand the connection between these mutations and disease. RNA-binding proteins (RBP) perform this translation by recognizing particular “phrases” that occupy short regions of the transcript. Recognition occurs by the binding of the RBP to the phrase. The set of phrases bound by a particular RBP is defined by the RNA base content of the binding site as well as the 3D configuration of these bases. Because it is impossible to assess RBP binding to every possible phrase, we have developed a mathematical model called RNAcontext that can be trained by measuring RBP binding strength on one set of phrases. Once trained, this model can then be used to accurately predict binding strength to any possible phrase. Compared to previously described methods, RNAcontext learns a more precise description of the 3D shapes of binding sites. This precision translates into more accurate generalization of RBP binding preferences to new phrases and allows us to make new discoveries about the binding preferences of well-studied RBPs.
