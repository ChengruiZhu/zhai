 conditions with 10 μM morphine treatment for 24 h. In addition, we measured the MOR-1 levels in recombinant Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells, transfected with human μ-opioid receptor gene (hMOR) with 10 μM morphine treatment for 24 h. The isolated mRNA from these cells was subjected to real-time quantitative RT-PCR analysis to determine the regulation of μ-opioid receptor gene expression. It was observed that morphine treatment did not alter MOR-1 levels in undifferentiated SH-SY5Y cells compared to undifferentiated control cells. However, the MOR-1 levels in all-trans-retinoic acid-differentiated cells were significantly higher compared to the undifferentiated cells. Morphine treatment in differentiated SH-SY5Y cells caused significant downregulation of MOR-1 expression compared to the control cells. In the morphine-treated CHO cells, the hMOR-1 mRNA levels remained the same as the untreated control. Finally, pretreatment of SH-SY5Y cells with 10 μM naloxone, the antagonist of μ-opioid receptor, for 1 h significantly blocked the downregulation of MOR-1 mRNA levels with morphine treatment. These findings suggest that regulation of MOR-1 gene expression is cell-type specific after chronic morphine treatment and provide some evidence in the understanding of morphine tolerance.
