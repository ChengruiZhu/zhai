Metabolism produces reactive oxygen species that damage our DNA and other cellular components, and as such it contributes to the aging process, including neuronal degeneration. Accordingly, genetic disorders associated with impaired DNA damage repair are frequently associated with premature onset of aging pathology in a variety of tissues, including the brain. This is well-illustrated by the progeroid DNA repair syndromes xeroderma pigmentosum (XP) and Cockayne syndrome (CS), in which patients suffer from defects in nucleotide excision repair (NER) and transcription-coupled repair (TCR), two partially overlapping DNA repair systems that remove helix-distorting and transcription-blocking lesions, respectively. We have used a panel of XP and CS mice (including conditional double-mutant animals) to systematically investigate the impact of NER and TCR defects on neuronal degeneration. We have shown that, whereas a TCR defect causes white matter pathology, a NER defect can result in age related cumulative loss of neurons. These findings well match the neuropathology observed in CS and XP patients, underscoring the impact of spontaneous DNA damage in the onset of neuronal aging. Therefore, the XP and CS mouse models serve as valuable tools to delineate intervention strategies that combat age-associated pathology of the brain.
