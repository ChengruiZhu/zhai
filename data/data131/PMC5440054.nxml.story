Chagas disease is caused by a unicellular parasite mainly transmitted by blood-feeding bugs. The disease starts with an acute phase when the parasite multiplies in tissues. The immune system is then activated and almost clears the parasites before the host enters the chronic phase of the disease. As hosts remain exposed to the vectors, secondary contacts may result in re-inoculation with the parasite. The re-inoculated parasites then have to face an adaptive immune response that may prevent reinfection. There is little quantitative knowledge about the frequency of such re-inoculation and the efficiency of the immune system to prevent them. Since reinfections can lead to people carrying two or more strains of the parasite, we can potentially infer on the frequency of reinfection from the detection of such mixed infections. We fitted agent-based models to field data to estimate the frequency of reinfection in humans and its timing after primary infection. Our models predicted that most reinfections occur during the chronic phase as the adaptive immune response fails to prevent them in 20% of re-inoculations. Such a rate of failure is particularly important as reinfections are thought to increase the risk of heart damage in the chronic phase of the disease.
