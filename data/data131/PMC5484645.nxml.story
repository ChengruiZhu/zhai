End-stage renal disease (ESRD) with immune disorder involves complex interactions between the innate and adaptive immune responses. ESRD is associated with various alterations in immune function such as a reduction in polymorphonuclear leukocyte bactericidal activity, a suppression of lymphocyte proliferative response to stimuli, and a malfunction of cell-mediated immunity at the molecular level. ESRD also increases patients' propensity for infections and malignancies as well as causing a diminished response to vaccination. Several factors influence the immunodeficiency in patients with ESRD, including uremic toxins, malnutrition, chronic inflammation, and the therapeutic dialysis modality. The alteration of T-cell function in ESRD has been considered to be a major factor underlying the impaired adaptive cellular immunity in these patients. However, cumulative evidence has suggested that the immune defect in ESRD can be caused by an Ag-presenting dendritic cell (DC) dysfunction in addition to a T-cell defect. It has been reported that ESRD has a deleterious effect on DCs both in terms of their number and function, although the precise mechanism by which DC function becomes altered in these patients is unclear. In this review, we discuss the effects of ESRD on the number and function of DCs and propose a possible molecular mechanism for DC dysfunction. We also address therapeutic approaches to improve immune function by optimally activating DCs in patients with ESRD.
