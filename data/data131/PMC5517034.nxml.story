Evolution is usually thought to occur very gradually, taking millennia or longer in order to appreciably affect a species' survival mechanisms. Conversely, demographic shifts due to predator invasion or environmental change can occur relatively quickly, creating abrupt and lasting effects on a species survival. However, recent studies of ecosystems ranging from the microbiome to oceanic predators have suggested that evolutionary and ecological processes can often occur over comparable timescalesâ€”necessitating that the two be addressed within a single, unified theoretical framework. Here, we show that when evolutionary effects are added to a minimal model of two competing species, the resulting ecosystem displays erratic and chaotic dynamics not typically observed in such systems. We then show that these chaotic dynamics arise from a subtle analogy between the evolutionary concept of fitness, and the concept of the free energy in thermodynamical systems. This analogy proves useful for understanding quantitatively how the concept of a changing fitness landscape can confer robustness to an ecosystem, as well as how unusual effects such as history-dependence can be important in complex real-world ecosystems. Our results predict a potential signature of a chaotic past in the distribution of timescales over which new species can emerge during the competitive dynamics, a potential waypoint for future experimental work in closed ecosystems with controlled fitness landscapes.
