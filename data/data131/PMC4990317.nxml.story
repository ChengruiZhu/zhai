In order to explore the potential effects of interleukin (IL)-35 on IL-10, transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β), interferon-γ (INF)-γ, IL-12 and IL-17, a pcDNA3.1-IL-35 plasmid was injected into the vitreous cavity of BALB/c mice. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, western blot analysis and quantitative PCR analysis were performed to confirm the successful expression of IL-35. Slit-lamp biomicroscopy, hematoxylin and eosin staining and immunofluorescence were employed to detect the status of eyes, and western blot analysis was performed to examine the expression of corneal graft rejection-related cytokines. There were no abnormalities in the eyes pre-mydriasis or post-mydriasis and no injuries to the cornea or retina following the injection of IL-35-expressing plasmid. An immunofluorescence assay detected the positive expression of IL-35 in corneal epithelial cells from IL-35-injected mice and negative staining in the control group. Further study revealed that IL-35 enhanced the expression of IL-10 and TGF-β which reached their highest levels at 1 and 2 weeks after injection, respectively (p<0.01). Moreover, the expression of INF-γ and IL-12 was decreased significantly at 2 weeks after the injection of IL-35-expressing plasmid (p<0.05), and the expression of IL-17 was suppressed notably at 4 weeks after the injection (p<0.05). The intravitreal injection of IL-35-expressing plasmid in mice downregulates the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines and upregulates the expression of anti-inflammatory cytokines. Thus, IL-35 may further be assessed as a potential target for the treatment of corneal graft rejection.
