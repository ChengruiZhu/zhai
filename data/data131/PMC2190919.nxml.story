Using an in vivo test system, the role of the beta 1 integrin very late activation antigen-4 (VLA-4) in eosinophil accumulation in allergic and nonallergic inflammatory reactions was investigated. Eosinophil infiltration and edema formation were measured as the local accumulation of intravenously injected 111In-labeled eosinophils and 125I-human serum albumin. The inflammatory reactions investigated were a passive cutaneous anaphylaxis (PCA) reaction and responses elicited by intradermal soluble inflammatory mediators (platelet-activating factor, leukotriene B4, C5a des Arg), arachidonic acid, and zymosan particles. The in vitro pretreatment of 111In-eosinophils with the anti- VLA-4 monoclonal antibody (mAb) HP1/2, which crossreacts with guinea pig eosinophils, suppressed eosinophil accumulation in all the inflammatory reactions investigated. Eosinophil accumulation was inhibited to the same extent when mAb HP1/2 was administered intravenously. It is interesting that HP1/2 had no effect on stimulated edema formation. These results suggest a role for VLA-4 in eosinophil accumulation in vivo and indicate a dissociation between the inflammatory events of eosinophil accumulation and edema formation.
