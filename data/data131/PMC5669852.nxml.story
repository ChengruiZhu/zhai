, Hepatitis A Virus (HAV). In humans, the pathogenesis of HAV is not well understood because of limited work with animal models. Here, we investigated the progress of duck viral hepatitis caused by DHAV and their potential for dissecting the pathogenesis of HAV. During the course of infection, the duck model had undergone hepatocellular lesions (vacuolation, acidophilic degeneration and steatosis), lymphocytes recruitment (neutrophil granulocytes, heterophilic granulocytes and T cells or plasm cells) and repair (activation of hepatic stellate cells, fibrosis and regeneration). Coincident with liver injury, the serum biomarkers, aspartate aminotransferase and alanine transaminase were significantly increased. Moreover, comparatively lower CD4+ and CD8+ T-cells were recruited to the liver, which might lead to a persistent infection (40 wk). Because DHAV and HAV have similar genomic structure, biological phenotypes and can easily replicate in liver. And half of fibrosis-related genes had high homology between humans and ducks. Considering these similarity in pathological and virological phenotypes, we proposed that the ducks might be an alternatively small animal model that would provide insight into the pathogenesis of viral hepatitis, fibrosis and liver regeneration.
