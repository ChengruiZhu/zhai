Pancreaticoenteric anastomosis is the origin of postoperative pancreatic fistula (POPF). Although a variety of methods have been proposed to decrease the POPF rate, randomized controlled trials performed so far have failed to demonstrate superiority of any particular method to the others. Cattell-Warren duct-to-mucosa pancreaticojejunostomy (PJ) is a widely practiced procedure. Their method is challenging, especially when the pancreatic duct is small. We assumed that the difficulty resides in the pancreatic duct becoming difficult to access when the posterior row is tied before suturing the anterior row. We have modified the duct-to-mucosa PJ so that the entire circumference of the inner layer can be sutured and tied in one-step by anchoring and retracting the anterior row. The jejunal roux-limb and pancreatic stump are positioned spatially apart, allowing enough space for free needle work. During a 13-year period, 151 patients underwent pancreaticoduodenectomy with this method, and the cumulative POPF and mortality rates were 37.1% and 4.6%, respectively. These rates were stable throughout the study period, implicating a relative independence from surgeons' experience. We believe that our method is intuitive, easy to grasp, and can be readily adopted even by surgeons not accustomed to pancreaticoduodenectomy.
