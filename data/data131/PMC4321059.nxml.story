Although low-dose radiation (LDR) regulates a wide range of biological processes, limited information is available on the effects of LDR on the chondrocyte phenotype. Here, we found that LDR, at doses of 0.5–2 centiGray (cGy), inhibited interleukin (IL)-1β-induced chondrocyte destruction without causing side effects, such as cell death and senescence. IL-1β treatment induced an increase in the expression of α-, β-, and γ-catenin proteins in chondrocytes via Akt signaling, thereby promoting dedifferentiation through catenin-dependent suppression of Sox-9 transcription factor expression and induction of inflammation through activation of the NF-κB pathway. Notably, LDR blocked cartilage disorders by inhibiting IL-1β-induced catenin signaling and subsequent catenin-dependent suppression of the Sox-9 pathway and activation of the NF-κB pathway, without directly altering catenin expression. LDR also inhibited chondrocyte destruction through the catenin pathway induced by epidermal growth factor, phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate, and retinoic acid. Collectively, these results identify the molecular mechanisms by which LDR suppresses pathophysiological processes and establish LDR as a potentially valuable therapeutic tool for patients with cytokine- or soluble factors-mediated cartilage disorders.
