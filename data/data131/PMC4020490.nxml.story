In this study, we investigated differentially expressed microRNAs (miRNAs or miRs) and their functions in metastatic melanoma using next-generation sequencing technology. The GSE36236 data set was downloaded from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database and 4 primary cutaneous melanoma samples (used as controls) and 3 metastatic melanoma samples were selected from 31 samples for further analysis. Firstly, the differentially expressed miRNAs were screened by limma package in R language. Secondly, the target genes of the miRNAs were retrieved with TargetScanHuman 6.2, and the interactions among these genes were identified by String and an interaction network was established. Finally, functional and pathway analyses were performed for the genes in the network using Expression Analysis Systematic Explorer (EASE). A total of 4 differentially expressed miRNAs (hsa-miR-146, hsa-miR-27, hsa-miR-877 and hsa-miR-186) were obtained between the metastatic melanoma and primary cutaneous melanoma samples. We predicted 101 high-confidence target genes of hsa-miR-27 and obtained a network with 41 interactions. Finally, functional and pathway analyses revealed that the genes in the network were significantly enriched at the transcriptional level. Differentially expressed miRNAs were identified in the metastatic melanoma compared with the primary cutaneous melanoma samples and the target genes of hsa-miR-27 were found to be significantly enriched at the transcriptional level. The results presented in our study may prove helpful in the diagnosis and treatment of metastatic melanoma.
