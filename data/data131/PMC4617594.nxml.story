: A total of 876 women were followed by colposcopy examination where biopsies were taken from the visible lesions or from suspicious areas and histopathology diagnosed 459 as normal or benign cases, 325 as CIN1, 36 as CIN2, 25 as CIN3/CIS, and 31 as invasive cancer. Of these 876 cases, manual cytology called 655 normal or ASCUS, 197 as LSIL, 16 cases as HSIL, and 8 as cancer. DNA measurements found 704 cases having no cells with DNA greater than 5c, 98 cases where there were 1 or 2 cells having DNA amount greater than 5c, and 74 cases where there were 3 or more cells having DNA amount greater than 5c. If manual cytology were to be used to refer all cases of HSIL and cancer to colposcopy and biopsy, 23 lesions that had to be removed would have been discovered (2 CIN2, 11 CIN3/CIS, and 10 cancers), for a sensitivity of 25.0±5.2% at specificity of 99.9±0.1%. If DNA assisted cytology were to be used instead, and all cases having 3 or more cells with DNA amount greater than 5c were to be referred to colposcopy and biopsy, then 50 lesions that had to be removed would have been discovered (10 CIN2, 15 CIN3/CIS and 25 cancers) for the sensitivity of 54.3±6.2% at specificity of 96.9±0.6%.
