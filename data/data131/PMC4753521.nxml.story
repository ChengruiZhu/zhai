, although their phosphorylation roles are unknown. Phosphorylation of Ser46 and Thr55 of p53-TAD increases its binding ability; however, the role of XPC-AF phosphorylation remains elusive. Here we describe a system for real-time and simultaneous monitoring of the phosphorylation and p62-PH affinity of p53-TAD and XPC-AF using nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. Unexpectedly, among seven reported kinases that presumably phosphorylate Ser46 and/or Thr55 of p53-TAD, only two specific and high-efficiency enzymes were identified: JNK2Î±2 for Ser46 and GRK5 for Thr55. During interaction with p62-PH, four different affinity complexes resulting from various phosphorylation states of p53-TAD by the kinases were identified. The kinetics of the site-specific phosphorylation reaction of p53-TAD and its affinity for p62-PH were monitored in real-time using the NMR system. Isothermic calorimetry showed that phosphorylation of Ser129 of XPC-AF increases binding to p62-PH. Although CK2 was predicted to phosphorylate Ser122, Ser129 and Ser140 from its sequence context, it specifically and efficiently phosphorylated only Ser129. Simultaneous monitoring of the phosphorylation and augmentation in p62-PH binding identified a key residue of p62-PH for contacting phosphorylated Ser129. In summary, we have established an NMR system for real-time and simultaneous monitoring of site-specific phosphorylation and enhancement of affinity between phosphorylation domains and their target. The system is also applicable to other posttranslational modifications.
