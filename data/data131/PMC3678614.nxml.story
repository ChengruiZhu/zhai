Approximately 30% of breast carcinoma patients experience local recurrence, which is commonly considered the first sign of treatment failure. Local recurrence involving the deep chest wall may result in thoracic defects and influence normal cardiopulmonary function. Many studies have reported various techniques using different materials for chest wall reconstruction, and titanium mesh has recently received attention as a novel bone substitute. In the present case report, a 46-year-old female who had not yet entered menopause presented for routine follow-up. Her past history was significant for having had a left modified radical mastectomy followed by chemotherapy and tamoxifen treatment for an invasive ductal breast carcinoma. Examination results revealed an invasive ductal carcinoma invading the chest wall. The patient underwent surgical excision and received a titanium mesh implant for chest wall reconstruction. The patient chose to undergo local radiation therapy and endocrine treatment following surgery. Local recurrence of breast cancer involving the deep chest wall is relatively rare. According to the guidelines, surgical excision followed by radiotherapy is the standard treatment and chemotherapy is not recommended. In our case, a titanium mesh was successfully applied for chest wall reconstruction.
