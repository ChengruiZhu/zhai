No histological changes were observed in the brain. In contrast, 4 of 10 animals in the gadodiamide group but none of the animals in other groups showed macroscopic and histological nephrogenic systemic fibrosis–like skin lesions. The Gd concentrations observed in the skin/brain samples (in nanomole Gd per gram of tissue) for each agent were as follows: gadodiamide: 1472 ± 115/11.1 ± 5.1, gadopentetate dimeglumine: 80.8 ± 6.2/13.1 ± 7.3, gadobutrol: 1.1 ± 0.5/0.7 ± 0.4, and gadoteridol: 1.7 ± 0.8/0.5 ± 0.2. The average detected residual Gd concentration in the brain was approximately 15-fold higher for linear than for macrocyclic GBCAs. The highest amounts of Gd found in brain corresponded to less than 0.0002% of the injected dose per gram of tissue. Using LA-ICP-MS, high Gd concentrations in the deep cerebellar nuclei and in the granular layer of the cerebellar cortex were detected only for linear gadodiamide and gadopentetate dimeglumine but not for gadoteridol or gadobutrol. The energy dispersive x-ray spectroscopy analysis revealed Gd-containing spots in the skin of animals administered gadodiamide and gadopentetate dimeglumine. Transmission electron microscopy revealed several Gd-containing spots in the region of the dentate nuclei in the brain of 1 animal injected with gadodiamide.
