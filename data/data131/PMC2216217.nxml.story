Previously undescribed high conductance single anion channels from frog skeletal muscle sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) were studied in native membrane using the "sarcoball" technique (Stein and Palade, 1988). Excised inside-out patches recorded in symmetrical 200 mM TrisCl show the conductance of the channel's predominant state was 505 +/- 25 pS (n = 35). From reversal potentials, the Pcl/PK ratio was 45. The slope conductance vs. Cl- ion concentration curve saturates at 617 pS, with K0.5 estimated at 77 mM. The steady-state open probability (Po) vs. holding potential relationship produces a bell-shaped curve, with Po values reaching a maximum near 1.0 at 0 mV, and falling off to 0.05 at +/- 25 mV. Kinetic analysis of the voltage dependence reveals that while open time constants are decreased somewhat by increases in potential, the largest effect is an increase in long closed times. Despite the channel's high conductance, it maintains a moderate selectivity for smaller anions, but will not pass larger anions such as gluconate, as determined by reversal-potential shifts. At least two substates different from the main open level are distinguishable. These properties are unlike those described for mitochondrial voltage- dependent anion channels or skeletal muscle surface membrane Cl channels and since SR Ca channels are present in equally high density in sarcoball patches, we propose these sarcoball anion channels originate from the SR. Preliminary experiments recording currents from frog SR anion channels fused into liposomes indicate that either biochemical isolation and/or alterations in lipid environment greatly decrease the channel's voltage sensitivity. These results help underline the potential significance of using sarcoballs to study SR channels. The steep voltage sensitivity of the sarcoball anion channel suggests that it could be more actively involved in the regulation of Ca2+ transport by the SR.
