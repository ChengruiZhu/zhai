In stable critically ill children, the adoption of a restrictive transfusion strategy based on a predefined hemoglobin threshold of 7 g/dl significantly decreased transfusion requirements without affecting outcome. These results strengthen previous observations made in volume resuscitated adults when a similar blood transfusion strategy was used. It also indirectly corroborates studies reporting the beneficial effects of leukoreduction of red blood cell (RBC) transfusion units on patient outcome. This study indicated that the maintenance of a higher hemoglobin concentration with RBC transfusion in an attempt to increase tissue oxygen delivery is not associated with a clinical benefit. This may be related to the storage process, which could affect the ability of RBCs to transport and deliver oxygen to the tissues. This point, however, remains controversial. It should also be remembered that increasing hemoglobin concentration will not always result in a greater oxygen delivery, as transfusion related increased blood viscosity could be associated with a reduction in blood flow. Further research should compare a symptomatic transfusion strategy to a hemoglobin-based strategy on the outcome of high risk patients.
