The overwhelming fraction of proteins whose sequences have been collected in comprehensive databases may never be assessed for function experimentally. Commonly, putative function is assigned based on similarity to experimentally characterized homologs, either on the level of the entire protein or for single evolutionarily conserved domains. The annotation of individual sites provides more detailed insights regarding the correspondence between sequence and function, as well as context for the interpretation of sequence variation and the outcomes of experiments. In general, site annotation has to be extracted from the published literature, and can often be transferred to closely related sequence neighbors. The National Center for Biotechnology Information's Conserved Domain Database (CDD) provides a system for curators to record functional (such as active sites or binding sites for cofactors) or characteristic sites (such as signature motifs), which are conserved across domain families, and for the transfer of that annotation to protein database sequences via high-confidence domain matches. Recently, CDD curators have begun to sort-site annotations into seven categories (active, polypeptide binding, nucleic acid binding, ion binding, chemical binding, post-translational modification and other) and here we present a first comparative analysis of sites obtained via domain model matches, juxtaposed with existing site annotation encountered in high-quality data sets. Site annotation derived from domain annotation has the potential to cover large fractions of protein sequences, and we observe that CDD-based site annotation complements existing site annotation in many cases, which may, in part, originate from CDD's curation practice of collecting sites conserved across diverse taxa and supported by evidence from multiple 3D structures.
