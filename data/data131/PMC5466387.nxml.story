S100A8/A9, a heterodimer of the two calcium-binding proteins S100A8 and S100A9, has emerged as an important proinflammatory mediator in acute and chronic inflammation. However, whether S100A8/A9 is implicated in microglial-induced neuroinflammatory response remains unclear. Here, we found that S100A8/A9 significantly increased the secretion of proinflammatory cytokines including tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) and interleukin-6 (IL-6) in cultured BV-2 microglial cells. Inhibition of the Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) and the receptor for advanced glycation end-products (RAGE) with C225 and a RAGE-blocking antibody, respectively significantly reduced the secretion of TNF-α and IL-6 from S100A8/A9-stimulated BV-2 microglial cells. Furthermore, S100A8/A9 markedly enhanced the nuclear translocation of NF-κB p65 and the DNA-binding activities of NF-κB in BV-2 microglial cells, and suppression of ERK and JNK/MAPK signaling pathways by PD98059 or SP600125 significantly inhibited NF-κB activity and the release of TNF-α and IL-6 in the S100A8/A9-treated BV-2 microglial cells. Our data also showed that inhibition of NF-κB with pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate (PDTC) significantly reduced the secretion of TNF-α and IL-6 from BV-2 microglial cells treated with S100A8/A9. Taken together, our data suggest that S100A8/A9 acts directly on BV-2 microglial cells via binding to TLR4 and RAGE on the membrane and then stimulates the secretion of proinflammatory cytokines through ERK and JNK-mediated NF-κB activity in BV-2 microglial cells. Targeting S100A8/A9 may provide a novel therapeutic strategy in microglial-induced neuroinflammatory diseases.
