Populations of Novikoff rat hepatoma cells (subline N1S1-67) were monitored for the rates of transport of various substrates and for their incorporation into acid-insoluble material as a function of the age of cultures of randomly growing cells in suspension as well as during traverse of the cells through the cell cycle. Populations of cells were synchronized by a double hydroxyurea block or by successive treatment with hydroxyurea and Colcemid. Kinetic analyses showed that changes in transport rates related to the age of cultures or the cell cycle stage reflecte alterations in the V max of the transport processes, whereas the Km remained constant, indicating that changes in transport rates reflect alterations in the number of functional transport sites. The transport sites for uridine and 2-deoxy-D-glucose increased continuously during traverse of the cells through the cell cycle, whereas those for choline and hypoxanthine were formed early in the cell cycle. Increases in thymidine transport sites were confined to the S phase. Synchronized cells deprived of serum failed to exhibit normal increases in transport sites, although the cells divided normally at the end of the cell cycle. Arrest of the cells in mitosis by treatment with Colcemid prevented any further increases in transport rates. The formation of functional transport sites was also dependent on de novo synthesis of RNA and protein. Inhibition of DNA synthesis in early S phase inhibited the increase in thymidine transport rates which normally occurs during the S phase, but had no effect on the formation of the other transport systems. Transport rates also fluctuated markedly with the age of the cultures of randomly growing cells, reaching maximum levels in the mid-exponential phase of growth. The transport systems for thymidine and uridine were rapidly lost upon inhibition of protein and RNA synthesis, and thus seem to be metabolically unstable, whereas the transport systems for choline and 2- deoxy-D-glucose were stable under the same conditions.
