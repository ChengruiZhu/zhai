Understanding the physical mechanisms by which signals are transduced across a lipid bilayer is central to an account of cell signalling. We have used a novel technique for performing simulations to model the interactions of transmembrane (TM) helices from bacterial methyl accepting chemoreceptor proteins with lipid bilayer membranes. These chemoreceptor signalling proteins dictate bacterial behaviour by biasing the movement of the cell towards food sources and away from toxins. The mechanism of signalling by these proteins through the membrane remains unclear, despite structural characterization of different components. Researchers have generated a large number of mutants in the TM2 helix, but the precise changes in helical behaviour which are induced by these mutants are not always clear. Our simulation approach allows the consequences of mutations to be unambiguously interpreted in terms of changes of position and orientation of the TM2 helix. Our results for the receptors Tar and Trg support a “swinging piston” model of signalling where changes in tilt and position of the helix relative the bilayer confer signals. This approach may be extended to a range of TM signalling events different classes of receptors and thus represents an advance in the interpretation of TM helix mutagenesis experiments.
