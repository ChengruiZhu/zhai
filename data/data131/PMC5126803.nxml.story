Background: Evidence based treatment interventions for young people with first-episode psychosis (FEP) and trauma histories is lacking. Although case formulation (CF) has been widely regarded in cognitive behavioural therapy manuals as beneficial, there is limited empirical research examining how clients and therapists experience the process. Aim: This study aimed to explore young people’s reactions to CF in treatment for PTSD (post-traumatic stress disorder) and FEP. Method: Semi-structured interviews were conducted with three participants (aged 19–20) with FEP and PTSD and their therapists, after they had completed a trauma-focused treatment program with a CF component. Transcripts were analysed using an interpretative phenomenological approach and themes were derived. Results: Two themes related to participants’ experiences were identified from the analysis: (1) Developing Insight; (2) A challenging experience; and two themes from the therapists: (1) Doing the case formulation; (2) Value of case formulation. Participants and therapists reported benefits in making connections between current symptoms and past trauma. Participants viewed the process as challenging. Conclusion: Results suggest a potential discrepancy between the experience of the case formulation process for clients and therapists.
