) and carboplatin (AUC 5) on day 1; Q21 days for 6 cycles. This study was a pooled study of two primary phase II studies. A total of 108 patients received the weekly schedule and 59 patients received the three-week schedule. All patients were evaluated for toxicity. The overall response rate was 79% and the biochemical response 93% for the weekly schedule. The median overall survival rate was 35.3 months. Neutropenia was significantly more common (ANOVA; p<0.0001) in the three-week group than in the weekly group during all six courses of chemotherapy. Fever and infections were also more common in this group. Thrombocytopenia and anemia were slightly more common in the weekly group. Fatigue, epiphora, nail changes and taste disturbances were specific side-effects following weekly docetaxel. Peripheral sensory neuropathy (grade 1–2) increased with every cycle of treatment, but in a similar manner in the two groups. Grade 3–4 neuropathy was not recorded. Oral mucositis and myalgia were two side-effects associated with the three-week schedule. Nausea and vomiting, diarrhea and dyspnea were a limited problem in both groups. Cardiac toxicity was rare and did not differ between the two docetaxel schedules. The weekly administration was favored due to the lower rates of neutropenia, fever, infections, oral mucositis and myalgia. However, epiphora and nail changes were specific side-effects of the weekly treatment. Both regimens appeared to be rather well tolerated with similar compliance (66 and 70%) with regard to completion of the planned six courses of chemotherapy.
