Marital status was found to be an independent prognostic factor for survival in several cancers. However related researches of oral tongue squamous cell carcinoma (OTSCC) are still rare. We explored the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) program and finally identified 14,194 patients with OTSCC. Kaplan-Meier analysis and multivariate Cox regression models were used to distinguish risk factors for overall survival (OS) and tumor cause-specific survival (TCSS). Widowed patients had the highest percentage of female, highest average ages and more prevalence with localized SEER Stage significantly, while patients in the single group were younger than other groups. After univariate analysis and multivariate analysis, marital status was demonstrated to be an independent prognostic factor of OS and TCSS. Married patients showed better 5-year OS (65.6%) and 5-year TCSS (89.9%) than other patients. Subgroup survival analysis according to AJCC TNM stage and SEER stage showed that the widowed patients demonstrated worst OS and TCSS compared to other groups. Marital status was an important prognostic factor for survival in patients with OTSCC. Widowed patients exhibited with the highest risk of death compared with other groups.
