Amyloid β (Aβ) deposition in the brain is an early and invariable feature of Alzheimer’s disease (AD). The Aβ peptides are composed of about 40 amino acids and are generated from amyloid precursor proteins (APP), by β- and γ-secretases. The distribution of individual Aβ peptides in the brains of aged people, and those suffering from AD and cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA), is not fully characterized. We employed the matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-imaging mass spectrometry (MALDI-IMS) to illustrate the spatial distribution of a broad range of Aβ species in human autopsied brains. With technical advancements such as formic acid pretreatment of frozen autopsied brain samples, we have: i) demonstrated that Aβ1–42 and Aβ1–43 were selectively deposited in senile plaques while full-length Aβ peptides such as Aβ1–36, 1–37, 1–38, 1–39, 1–40, and Aβ1–41 were deposited in leptomeningeal blood vessels. ii) Visualized distinct depositions of N-terminal truncated Aβ40 and Aβ42, including pyroglutamate modified at Glu-3 (N3pE), only with IMS for the first time. iii) Demonstrated that one single amino acid alteration at the C-terminus between Aβ1–42 and Aβ1–41 results in profound changes in their distribution pattern.
