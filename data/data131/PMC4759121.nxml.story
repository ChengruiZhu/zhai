Overlapping characteristics of Brugada syndrome (BrS) and arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy/dysplasia (ARVC/D) have been reported in recent studies, but little is known about the overlapping disease state of BrS and ARVC/D. A 36-year-old man, hospitalized at our institution for syncope, presented with this overlapping disease state. The electrocardiogram showed spontaneous coved-type ST-segment elevation, and ventricular fibrillation was induced by right ventricular outflow tract stimulation in an electrophysiological study. BrS was subsequently diagnosed; additionally, the presence of epsilon-like waves and right ventricular structural abnormalities met with the 2010 revised task force criteria for ARVC/D. After careful investigation for both BrS and ARVC/D, an implantable cardioverter defibrillator was inserted in the patient. This case revealed 2 important clinical findings: (1) BrS and ARVC/D clinical features can coexist in a single patient, and EPS might be useful for determining the phenotype of overlapping disease (e.g., BrS-like or ARVC/D-like). (2) An overlapping disease state of BrS and ARVC/D can change phenotypically during its clinical course. Therefore, careful examination and attentive follow-up are required for patients with BrS or ARVC/D.
