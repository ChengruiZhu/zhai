The modification of synaptic connections by specific activity histories (a phenomenon known as synaptic plasticity) is widely believed to represent a major substrate of processes collectively referred to as learning and memory. Recent studies indicate, however, that synapses also change spontaneously, even in the absence of specific activity histories—or, for that matter, any activity whatsoever. This raises a fundamental question: how do changes directed by specific activity histories quantitatively compare to spontaneous changes in synaptic properties? Put differently—what is the “signal-to-noise ratio” of synaptic plasticity at individual synapses? To address this question we followed—over several days—pairs of synapses formed between the same neurons under the assumption that their common activity histories should drive similar changes in their sizes. Indeed, sizes of such synapses tended to change in a correlated manner; yet the extent of this correlation was surprisingly modest, accounting for less than half of the changes that such synapses exhibited. Moreover, sizes of synapses with apparently common activity histories tended to be quite different. Our findings thus indicate that the “signal-to-noise ratio” of synapse remodeling might be rather poor, on the order of 1:1 or less.
