When cells divide, not only DNA but an entire pattern of gene expression can be passed from mother to daughter cell. Once cell division is complete, random processes cause this pattern to change, with closely related cells growing less similar over time. We measured inheritance of a dynamic gene-expression state in single yeast cells. We used an engineered network where individual cells switch between two semi-stable states (ON and OFF), even in a constant environment. Several generations after cells have physically separated, many pairs of closely related cells switch in near synchrony. We quantified this effect by measuring how likely a mother cell is to have switched given that the daughter cell has already switched. This yields a conditional probability distribution that is very different from the exponential one found in the entire population of switching cells. We measured the extent to which this correlation between switching cells persists by comparing our results with a model Poisson process. Together, these findings demonstrate the inheritance of a dynamic gene expression state whose post-division changes include both random factors arising from noise as well as correlated factors that originate in two related cells' shared history. Finally, we constructed a model that demonstrates that our major findings can be explained by burst-like fluctuations in the levels of a single regulatory protein.
