The antimicrobial peptide LL-37 not only contributes to the host defence against microbial invasion but also regulates immune activity, angiogenesis and cell proliferation. Studies have shown that LL-37 participates in the development of a variety of tumours, such as lung cancer, ovarian cancer, breast cancer and melanoma. However, the role of LL-37 in the development of skin squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) is not clear. The present study used immunohistochemistry to confirm that the expression of human DNA-binding protein A (dbpA) was increased in SCC tissues. After stimulating SCC A341 cells, LL-37 was shown promote the proliferation, migration and invasion of these malignant cells. LL-37 also promoted the upregulation of dbpA mRNA and protein expression. In addition, after using small interfering RNA to silence the normal dbpA expression in these malignant cells, the proliferation and invasion of the tumor cells were significantly reduced. When the NF-κB inhibitor PDTC was used to inhibit the process of LL-37-stimulated cells, it was found that the original upregulated expression of dbpA was downregulated. Overall, the present demonstrated that by upregulating the expression of dbpA, LL-37 can promote the proliferation and invasion of tumour cells, and that this process depends on the NF-κB signalling pathway.
