Between 2007 and 2009, 279 patients who underwent primary ACL reconstruction with an autogenous patellar tendon graft from the contralateral knee met the inclusion criteria of unilateral knee involvement, no evidence of arthritic changes preoperatively, and minimum 2 year follow-up objective and subjective evaluations. A control group was obtained of 58 patients who had the same inclusion criteria, were of the same age, but underwent surgery with ipsilateral graft. Patients underwent a goal-directed and sequential postoperative rehabilitation program that emphasized controlling a hemarthrosis, obtaining full knee range of motion as soon as possible after surgery, increasing leg strength, and functional activities to return patients back to sports. The rehabilitation for the contralateral donor site emphasized high repetition/low resistance exercises beginning the day after surgery to reconstitute the patellar tendon size and strength. IKDC subjective data was compared between surgery groups and established normative data. Quadriceps muscle strength was evaluated in both knees compared to the pre-operative values obtained in the non-involved knee; strength between knees at 2 years postoperatively was also evaluated.
