Intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR) is one of the leading causes of perinatal mortality and can be defined as a low birth weight together with signs of chronic hypoxia or malnutrition. It is mostly due to placental insufficiency resulting in a chronic restriction of oxygen and nutrients to the fetus. IUGR leads to cardiac dysfunction in utero which can persist postnatally. Under these altered conditions, IUGR fetuses redistribute their blood in order to maintain delivery of oxygenated blood to the brain, known as brain sparing. Given that, in the fetus the aortic isthmus (AoI) is a key arterial connection between the cerebral and placental circulations, quantifying AoI blood flow has been proposed to assess this brain sparing effect in clinical practice. However, which remodeling or redistribution processes in the cardiovascular systems induce the observed changes in AoI flow in IUGR fetuses is not fully understood. We developed a computational model of the fetal circulation, including the key elements related to fetal blood redistribution. Using measured cardiac outflow profiles to allow personalization, we can recreate and better understand the blood flow changes in individual IUGR fetuses.
