The vast number of protein sequences being determined by the international genomics projects means that it is not possible to functionally characterise all the proteins through direct experimentation. One of the more successful electronic methods for detecting functionally associated genes has been through the comparison of genes' phylogenetic profiles. This method is based on the hypothesis that two functionally related genes will show very similar presenceâ€“absence profile patterns throughout different organisms. Whilst these methods have grown increasingly sophisticated, they have largely been based on detecting functionally homologous genes in different species (technically known as orthologous genes) and thus better suited to prokaryotic genomes, where this can be done more easily. We have developed a new type of hierarchical phylogenetic profile by subdividing protein families into subclusters in different sequence identity levels. This new approach encapsulates a more realistic model of the functional variation that uneven natural selection pressure produces on different protein families and organisms, and it can detect functional relationships between protein families without the initial application of rigid sequence similarity thresholds or complex protocols for orthology assignment. These advantages are especially useful in eukaryotes since the larger average size of eukaryotic multigene families makes them more prone to orthology mis-assignment than in prokaryotes.
