 A high incidence of acute diffuse glomerulitis was produced in unilaterally nephrectomized rabbits by injection with two successive doses of purified bovine serum gamma globulin (fraction II). This experimental nephritis is morphologically analogous to human acute and subacute diffuse glomerulonephritis. The technique described is advanced as a valuable experimental method in the study of the pathogenesis of glomerulonephritis. Qualitative immunological investigations produced no evidence that the pathogenesis of experimental globulin nephritis is mediated by kidney autoantibodies. The r√¥le of hypersensitivity in the pathogenesis of nephritis is discussed. During the 1st week of the development of experimental globulin nephritis there is a significant increase in blood coagulability, as shown by a lowering of the mean coagulation time in globulin-treated animals during this period. This observation has not been reported previously. The possible relation of this increased blood coagulability to the formation of coagula in the glomerular capillaries is discussed. The injection of a single purified antigen (bovine serum gamma globulin) produced three distinct types of lesion, diffuse glomerulitis, focal granulomata of the heart valves and valve rings, and coronary arteritis.
