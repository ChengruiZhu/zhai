Respiration plays an important role in the overall metabolism of plants, and certainly is related to gas exchange of plants with the environment. In roots and bulky storage organs such as fruit and tubers, where the length of the diffusion path may be considerable, anoxic conditions may even occur. This is of particular importance in fruit, which are often stored under low-oxygen conditions to extend their storage life. In this manuscript, we have developed a new mathematical model to describe the gas transport and respiration kinetics in intact pear fruit. Michaelis-Menten kinetics was used to describe the respiration behavior of tissues. Diffusion was the main driving force for gas exchange. Differences in diffusion rates of the different gasses led to total pressure gradients that caused convective exchange as described by Darcy's law. The model incorporates the actual shape of the fruit and was solved using fluid dynamics software. It is a first step towards a multiscale model that addresses all spatial scales relevant to gas transport. These findings can be used to evaluate the effect of environmental stresses on fruit via in silico experiments and may lead to commercial solutions for long-term storage of fruit under controlled atmospheres.
