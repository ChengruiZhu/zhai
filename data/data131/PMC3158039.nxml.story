The complex biological processes occurring in living organisms are enabled by numerous networks of interacting proteins. It is therefore of great interest to understand the physical interplay between proteins and, in particular, how this process gives rise to highly specific network connectivities. For a long time, the dominant molecular view of protein-protein interactions was the docking of more or less static folded structures, with specificity obtained from a complementarity in shape and charge distributions. Lately it has been realized that many of the links in protein networks are mediated by interactions between folded domains, on the one hand, and disordered polypeptide segments, on the other. We use an all-atom Monte Carlo based approach which attempts to capture this domain-peptide binding process in full and apply it to representative members of a common domain family. This allows us to examine and compare detailed aspects of the binding free energy landscapes which underlie specificity and affinity. Being able to model domain-peptide binding in a physically sound, yet computationally tractable way is essential for identifying molecular binding mechanisms and opens up possibilities for modifying interaction networks in a controlled way.
