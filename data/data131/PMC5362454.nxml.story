Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) is one of the most aggressive non-Hodgkin lymphomas. It is curable but one-third of cases are refractory to therapy or relapse after initial response highlighting the urgent need for developing novel therapeutic approaches. Targeting sirtuins, particularly SIRT1 by genetic approaches or using pharmaceutical inhibitor tenovin-6, has shown promising therapeutic potential in various hematopoietic malignancies. However, it remains unknown whether these approaches are effective for DLBCL. In this study, we have found that tenovin-6 potently inhibits the proliferation and survival of DLBCL cells. Surprisingly, specific knockdown of SIRT1/2/3 has no effect on DLBCL. Mechanistically, tenovin-6 increases the level of microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3B (LC3B)-II in a SIRT1/2/3- and p53-independent manner in DLBCL cell lines. Tenovin-6-mediated increase of LC3B-II is through inhibition of classical autophagy pathway. Furthermore, inhibition of the autophagy pathway by using other inhibitors or by knocking down key genes in the pathway impairs cell proliferation and survival of DLBCL cells. These results indicate that targeting the autophagic pathway could be a novel therapeutic strategy for DLBCL and that precaution should be taken to interpret data where tenovin-6 was used as an inhibitor of sirtuins.
