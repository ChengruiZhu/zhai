The collection and analysis of clinical data has played a key role in providing insights into the diagnosis, prognosis and treatment of disease. However, it is imperative that molecular and genetic data also be collected and integrated into the creation of network models, which capture underlying mechanisms of disease and can be interrogated to elucidate previously unknown biology. Bringing data from the clinic to the bench completes the cycle of translational research, which we demonstrate with this work. We built disease models from genetics, whole blood gene expression profiles and the component clinical measures of rheumatoid arthritis using a data-driven approach that leverages supercomputing. Genetic factors can be utilized as a source of perturbation to the system such that causal connections between genetics, molecular entities and clinical outcomes can be inferred. The existing TNF-α blocker treatments for rheumatoid arthritis are only effective for approximately 2/3 of the affected population. We identified novel therapeutic intervention points that may lead to the development of alternatives to TNF-α blocker treatments. We believe this approach will provide improved drug discovery programs, new insights into disease progression, increased drug efficacy and novel biomarkers for chronic and complex diseases.
