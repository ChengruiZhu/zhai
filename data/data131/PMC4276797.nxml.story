Most intraoperative provocative tests previously reported were performed after mesh adjustment to confirm the absence of urine leakage. Instead, our test was performed before adjustment of the mesh to control the tape tension after observing the pattern of the urine leakage. We studied whether this method had an effect on the success rate of transobturator tape (TOT) procedures. A total of 96 patients were included: 47 patients underwent TOT procedures without intraoperative testing (Group I) and 49 patients underwent TOT procedures with testing (Group II). Bladder filling was performed with at least 300 ml of normal saline during the test. After observing the pattern of the urine leakage before adjustment of the mesh by coughing or manual pressure on the suprapubic area, we controlled the mesh tension. In Group I, which did not undergo the intraoperative test, the Valsalva leak-point pressure, cough leak-point pressure, preoperative and postoperative peak flow velocity (Qmax), and postvoiding residual urine (PVR) were 86.46 cmHO, 25.60 ml/s, 26.90 ml/s, 17.16 ml, and 29.67 ml, respectively. Changes in the postoperative and preoperative Qmax and PVR were 1.3 ml/s and 12.51 ml, respectively. The two groups showed no significant differences in any of the variables. In Group I, the cure and improvement rates were 70.2% and 27.7%, respectively. In Group II, the rates were 91.8% and 8.2%, respectively. Group II had a significantly higher success rate than Group I (p value= 0.011). In the univariable logistic regression analysis, Group II exhibited a higher odds ratio (4.771) than Group I in terms of cure rate, and Group II had a higher success rate than Group I (p value=0.011). In the multivariable logistic regression analysis, Group II exhibited a higher odds ratio (4.700) than Group I in terms of cure rate under calculation of the variables (namely, age, hypertension, preoperative Qmax, and PVR), and the cure rate of Group II was verified to be significantly higher than that of Group I (p value=0.019). We suggest that our test is an effective method to confirm whether adequate tension is being applied to the tape. Our method presents some advantages in that surgeons can control and adjust the tension of the mesh after observing the degree and pattern of the urine leakage.
