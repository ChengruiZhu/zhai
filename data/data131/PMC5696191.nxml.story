 intravenously on day 1 and 8, S-1 was given twice a day orally on day 1-14 of each 21-day cycle, for 6 cycles. The primary endpoint was objective response rate (ORR), the secondary endpoints were progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS) and safety. The ORR in intent-to-treat population (N=60) by either blinded independent review (BIR) or investigator assessment was 50.0%. Median PFS (mPFS) by BIR and median OS (mOS) were 5.6 months (95%CI, 4.6 to 6.6 m) and 9.4 months (95%CI, 8.0 to 10.8m), respectively. The most common grade 3 or 4 toxicities were leukopenia/neutropenia (35%) and fatigue (8.3%). Subgroup analyses based on BIR showed a remarkable ORR (>70%) was achieved in patients with female gender, ≥ 50% decline from baseline CA19-9, and developed grade 3 or 4 leukopenia/neutropenia. Remarkable survival benefit was statistically significant in female (mPFS: 7.7m, mOS: 18.2m), ≥ 50% decline from baseline CA19-9 (mPFS: 6.8m, mOS: 11.8m), objective responders (mPFS: 6.9m, mOS: 12.2m), and ECOG of 0 at baseline (mPFS: 7.5m, mOS: 16.1m). Nab-paclitaxel plus S-1 showed encouraging ORR and manageable toxicities, which is an effective alternative treatment regimen for advanced pancreatic cancer. (
