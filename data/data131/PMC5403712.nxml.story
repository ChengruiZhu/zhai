Polycomb group (PcG) proteins form at least two key complexes, namely polycomb repressive complex 1 and polycomb repressive complex 2. These complexes are involved in the progression of various cancers. Systematic research has not been conducted on the aberrant expression of PcG members in gliomas. Using the Chinese Glioma Genome Atlas data set, PcG expression patterns between normal brain tissues and glioma samples were analyzed, and a PcG-based classifier was then developed using BRB Cox regression and risk-score model. These results were validated in an independent GSE16011 set. A total of six PcGs [chromobox protein homolog (CBX) 6, CBX7, PHD finger protein 1, enhancer of zeste homolog 2 (EZH2), DNA (cytosine-5-)-methyltransferase 3Î² (DNMT3B) and polyhomeotic-like protein 2] were identified to be associated with glioma grade. Survival analysis then revealed a five-PcG gene signature one protective gene (enhancer of zeste homolog 1) and four risky genes (EZH2, PHD finger protein 19, DNMT3A and DNMT3B), which may identify patients with high risk of poor prognosis of glioma. Multivariate Cox analysis indicated that the five-PcG signature was an independent prognostic biomarker. These findings indicated that a novel prognostic classifier, five-PcG signature, served as an independent prognostic marker for patients with glioma.
