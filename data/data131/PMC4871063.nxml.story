Each country had a unique pattern of ANC utilization in terms of coverage, inequality and the extent to which predictors affected the frequency of visits. Nevertheless, common patterns arise. Women having four or more visits usually saw a skilled provider at least once, and received more evidence–based content interventions than women reporting fewer than four visits. A considerable proportion of women reporting four or more visits did not report receiving the essential interventions. Large disparities exist in ANC use by household wealth, women’s education and residence area; and are wider for a larger number of visits. The multivariable analyses of two models in each country showed that determinants had different effects on the dependent variable in each model. Overall, strong predictors of ANC initiation and having a higher frequency (4+) of visits were woman’s education and household wealth. Gestational age at first visit, birth rank and preceding birth interval were generally negatively associated with initiating visits and with having four or more visits. Information on country policies and programs were somewhat informative in understanding the utilization patterns across the countries, although timing of adoption and actual implementation make direct linkages impossible to verify.
