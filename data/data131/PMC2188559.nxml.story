Ultrastructural studies of Aeromonas hydrophila strain AH26 revealed two distinctive pilus types: "straight" pili appear as brittle, rod- like filaments, whereas "flexible" pili are supple and curvilinear. Straight pili are produced constitutively under all tested conditions of growth. In contrast, the expression of flexible pili is regulated by physical and chemical variables, being produced at 22 vs. 37 degrees C, in a liquid vs. a solid medium, and when the availability of free-iron is reduced by the presence of deferoxamine mesylate. Both pilus proteins were purified and biochemically and functionally characterized. The major repeating subunit of the straight pilus is a 17,000-mol wt polypeptide with amino acid sequence homology with Escherichia coli type 1 and Pap pili. The flexible pilus filament is a homopolymer composed of a novel 46 amino acid polypeptide. Resistance of the flexible pilus filament to disaggregation using various chemical treatments was demonstrated; its stability as a polymer and its apparent mechanical strength seem to be conferred by a 20 amino acid hydrophobic, COOH-terminal domain. Purified straight pili lack hemagglutinating function. In contrast, purified flexible pili cause the agglutinin of human, guinea pig, ovine, bovine, and avian erythrocytes, although this property could only be demonstrated in the presence of divalent cations and was most evident at 4 vs. 22 degrees C. Taken together, these results suggest that the pathogenic and ecological roles of the flexible pilus are related to this species' existence as a free-living organism in aquatic environments and its ability to cause infections, both in cold-blooded vertebrates and the human intestine.
