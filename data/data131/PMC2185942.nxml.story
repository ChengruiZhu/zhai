Eosinophil peroxidase (EPO) at relatively low levels (4-30 mU), when supplemented with H2O2 and a halide, induced mast cell degranulation. Histamine release occurred without concomitant release of the cytoplasmic marker lactic dehydrogenase (LDH), and this, together with ultrastructural studies, indicated a noncytotoxic effect comparable with that induced by other mast cell secretagogues. At pH 7.4, iodide was effective at concentrations down to 10(-5) M, and although chloride alone was ineffective at 0.1 M, a combination of 0.1 M chloride and 10(- 6) iodide could meet the halide requirement. Chloride alone was effective at pH 6.5 and 6.0. EPO could be replaced by myeloperoxidase. When the EPO level was increased to 100 mU, combination with H2O2- and iodide-induced cytotoxic histamine release as indicated by concomitant LDH release and ultrastructural evidence of cell disruption. This cytotoxic response reverted to a secretory one on the addition of albumin. Peroxidase was detected on the surface of extruded granules by diaminobenzidine cytochemistry. The mast cell granule (MCG)/EPO complex when supplemented with H2O2 and iodide was more effective than free EPO in the stimulation of mast cell secretion. The stimulation of mast cell mediator release by the EPO-H2O2-halide system and the formation of MCG/EPO complexes with augmented cytotoxic activity may influence the adjacent inflammatory response.
