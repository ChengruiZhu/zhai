Genetic interactions occur when a combination of mutations results in a surprising phenotype. These interactions capture functional redundancy, and thus are important for predicting function, dissecting protein complexes into functional pathways, and exploring the mechanistic underpinnings of common human diseases. Due to the large number of possible combinations of genes, only a small portion of gene pairs in yeast and only a few pairs in higher organisms like mouse and human have been tested. Therefore, predicting genetic interactions has received significant attention in the past several years. The existing methods primarily rely on the known genetic interactions, and thus are far less effective in classifying most gene pairs not well connected with known genetic interactions. Here we developed a non-parametric multi-classifier system for predicting genetic interactions based on a large number of novel features independent of the known genetic interactions. This approach led to an improved performance when compared to the current state-of-the-art method. Using this approach, we derived the first yeast transcription factor genetic interaction network, part of which was well supported by literature. This integrative approach is expected to be more effective and robust in uncovering new genetic interactions in yeast and other species.
