. Functionally, Twist over-expression caused estrogen independent proliferation of breast cells and promoted hormone resistance to the selective estrogen receptor modulator (SERM) tamoxifen and selective estrogen receptor down-regulator (SERD) fulvestrant. Importantly, this effect was reversible on down-regulating Twist. Additionally, orthotopic tumors generated in mice using MCF-7/Twist cells were resistant to tamoxifen. These tumors had high vascular volume and permeability surface area as determined by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Mechanistically, Twist recruited DNA methyltransferase 3B (DNMT3B) to the ER promoter leading to a significantly higher degree of ER promoter methylation compared to parental cells. Furthermore, we demonstrated by co-immunoprecipitation that Twist interacted with histone deacetylase 1 (HDAC1) at the ER promoter, causing histone deacetylation and chromatin condensation, further reducing ER transcript levels. Functional re-expression of ER was achieved using demethylating agent 5-azacytidine and histone deacetylase inhibitor valproic acid. Finally, an inverse relationship was observed between Twist and ER expression in human breast tumors. In summary, the regulation of ER by Twist could be an underlying mechanism for loss of ER activity observed in breast tumors and may contribute to the generation of hormone resistant ER negative breast cancer.
