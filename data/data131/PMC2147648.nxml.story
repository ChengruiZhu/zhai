 were studied under different environmental conditions. With the analysis presented changes in resistance of the protoplasmic membrane and of cell sap can be studied independently and simultaneously. Under "transcellular osmosis," the resistance of the protoplasmic membrane and of the cell sap increase at the part of the cell where water enters, while they decrease where water goes out. Ethanol of low concentration (below 8 per cent) first decreases and later increases the resistance of the protoplasmic membrane. Concentrated ethanol (over 10 per cent), however, brings about a large decrease in resistance of the protoplasmic membrane. Its time course is not simple, but undulatory changes occur. When ethanol is applied to one part of the cell, the resistance of the protoplasmic membrane shows a different type of change, which may be attributed to the local osmotic effect of ethanol; injury generally occurs with comparatively low concentration. Methanol, ethanol, and propanol have almost the same effect upon the cell, while butanol is toxic at the same concentration. When the cell dies, the resistance of the protoplasmic membrane decreases greatly, while the resistance of the cell sap increases to a level (several hundred kilo ohms or more), expected when external solution and cell sap are freely mixed with each other.
