11 patients (18.6%) reported knee function <15% on the IKDC at 2 years (Normal: 93.8±4.5%, 95% CI: 92.3-95.1; Below Normal: 72.1±12.7%, 95% CI: 63.6-80.6). No group differences existed for age (p=0.613) or sex (p=0.320) between those who scored in the normal range and those who scored <15%. Patients with self-reported IKDC knee function <15% had significantly lower IKDC scores at baseline (p=0.010; Normal: 83.0±10.0%, 95% CI: 80.1-85.9; Below Normal: 72.7±10.8%, 95% CI: 64.9-80.4) and required a greater number of days to achieve a quiet knee after injury (p=0.005; Normal: 58.5±21.9 days, 95% CI: 52.1-64.8; Below Normal: 77.6±17.7 days, 95% CI: 65.7-89.5). A trend toward significance was present for quadriceps strength (p=0.076; Normal: 93.5±9.1%, 95% CI: 90.8-96.1; Below Normal: 88.4±7.4%, 95% CI: 83.4-93.4) but no group differences were present for hop scores (single: p=0.684; crossover: p=0.630; triple: p=0.724; 6-meter timed: p=0.341), KOS (p=0.119), or GR (p=0.136). A logistic regression model including IKDC, days to achieve a quiet knee, and quadriceps strength was statistically significant with IKDC and days to achieve a quiet knee being significant predictors of knee function at 2 years (p=0.001; R2=0.433; IKDC: p=0.040, OR=0.909; days to achieve a quiet knee: p=0.014, OR=1.054; quad strength: p=0.220, OR=0.941).
