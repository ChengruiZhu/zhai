 The interaction of progesterone, testosterone, androsterone, and etiocholanolone with insoluble lipid films (cholesterol and saturated hydrocarbons containing either alcohol, ester, acetamide, phosphate, amine, or carboxyl groups) was studied. In addition to surface pressure and surface potential measurements of the surface films, radioactive tracers were used to measure the concentration of adsorbed steroid in the lipid films. In general, steroids form mixed films with the insoluble lipid films. Compression of the insoluble lipid films to their most condensed state leads to complete ejection of adsorbed steroid from the surface in all cases except with the amine, for which a small amount of steroid is still retained in the surface. Interactions between the steroids and insoluble lipids are primarily due to van der Waals or dispersion forces; there were no significant contributions from dipole-dipole interactions (except possibly with the amine). Specific interactions between cholesterol and the soluble steroids were not observed. Evidence suggests that low steroid concentrations influence structure of lipid films by altering the hydration layer in the surface film. In contrast to a specific site of action, it is proposed that steroid hormones initiate structural changes in a variety of biological sites; this model of steroid action is consistent with the ubiquity of many steroid hormones.
