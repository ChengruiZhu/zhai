Forty male rats belonging to Sprague Dawley strain were divided into two groups. Group 1 (n=20) subdivided into an experimental subgroup of 10 rats that were immobilized in plaster of Paris (POP) for 4 weeks and a control subgroup of 10 that were not immobilized. Group 2 (n=20) subdivided into an experimental subgroup of 10 rats that were immobilized for 4 weeks and remobilized for next 4 weeks and a control subgroup of 10 animals that were not immobilized. At the end of the experimental period, the knee joint was dissected and was cut in sagittal plane. The section was fixed in 10% formalin for 48 hours. Specimen was decalcified using ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA). The paraffin blocks of 7 Î¼m sections were cut and stained by H and E stain for routine histology and Alcian blue stain and Mallory Trichrome for fine structural microscopy. The zones were named as superficial transitional, radial, and hypertrophic according to the shape of cells present in each zone. The superficial zone was divided into superior part, central, and inferior parts. These parts were labeled as central, proximal, and distal segments. The calibrated stage micrometer was used to calibrate the ocular micrometer under objectives of different power. The ocular micrometer was placed inside the ocular lens. It was calibrated with the stage micrometer under objective lenses of different power. The number of divisions of ocular covering each zone was calculated. These divisions were converted into micrometer and the actual thickness was calculated.
