The aim of this study was to evaluate the safety and feasibility of the new 5 Fr Glidesheath Slender (GSS). The transradial (TR) approach has become popular because of several advantages, such as a reduced rate of vascular access site complications. However, because the radial artery is narrow, a limitation of TR access is the potential for artery spasm or occlusion. Studies of radial artery size demonstrate that 5 Fr sheaths are too wide for more than 10 % of patients. The GSS (Terumo, Tokyo, Japan) is a new radial sheath with a thinner wall and a hydrophilic coating. It has an inner diameter that is compatible with a 5 Fr guiding catheter, while the outer diameter is similar to that of a 4 Fr sheath. A total of 21 consecutive patients undergoing transradial angiography and/or transradial percutaneous coronary intervention with the 5 Fr GSS were included, and safety and feasibility of the device were assessed. Transradial angiography was performed in 10 patients, and transradial intervention in 11 patients. All procedures were successful, without the need for conversion to the transfemoral approach. The radial artery occlusion rate was 0 %, including a patient who had experienced six previous radial artery punctures. There were no cases of artery spasm, hematoma, major bleeding or functional disorders. One coronary artery perforation caused by a guidewire was reported, but it was unrelated to the sheath introducer. The new 5 Fr GSS was safe and feasible for transradial angiography and transradial intervention.
