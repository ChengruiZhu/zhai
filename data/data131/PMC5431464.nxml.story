Astrocytomas (gliomas) are the most common primary brain tumors among adults and second most frequent neoplasm among children. New ideas and novel approaches are being explored world over with aim to devise better management strategeies for this deadly pathological state. We searched the electronic database PubMed for pre-clinical as well as clinical controlled trials reporting importance of various therapeutic drugs against gliomas. It was observed clearly that this approach of using therapeutic drugs is clearly evolving and has been observed to be promising future therapeutic avenue against gliomas. The searched literature on whole revealed that although gliomas are treated aggressively with surgery, chemotherapy and radiation, treatment resistance, drug toxicity and poor response rates among pediatric glioma patients, continue to drive the need to discover new and more effective chemotherapeutic agents. The present review is focused on the latest updates in therapeutic drugs against gliomas in pediatric patients. The important chemo-therapeutics discussed in this review included alkylating agents like temoxolomide, derivatives of platinum, nitrosoureas, topoisomerases, angiogenesis inhibitors and cytomegalovirus as therapeutic agents.
