We must constantly learn in order to meet the demands of a dynamically changing environment. The basis of learning is believed to be synaptic plasticity, i.e. the potential of neuronal connections to change. Depending on context, however, it may be either useful to learn and modify connections or, alternatively, to keep an established network structure stable to maintain what has been already learned (also referred to as the plasticity-stability dilemma). The ability to switch synaptic plasticity on and off in a flexible way hence constitutes an attractive feature of neuronal processing. Here, we analyze a cellular mechanism based on the inhibition-mediated gating of coincidence signals required for Hebbian forms of excitatory synaptic plasticity. While experimental evidence in support of individual steps involved in this mechanism is accumulating, it is as of now unclear whether this mechanism can indeed operate robustly under physiologically realistic parameters of pyramidal cells, in particular, without impairing information flow in these cells altogether. Computational modeling allows us to demonstrate that this is indeed possible if inhibition is well timed (on the order of 1 ms). Moreover, we show that a specific design of the local circuit can ensure the necessary timing.
