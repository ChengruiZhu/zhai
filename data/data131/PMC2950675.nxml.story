Pharmaceutical science is only beginning to scratch the surface on the exact mechanisms of drug action that lead to a drug's breadth of patient responses, both intended and side effects. Decades of clinical trials, molecular studies, and more recent computational analysis have sought to characterize the interactions between a drug and the cell's molecular machinery. We have devised an integrated computational approach to assess how a drug may affect a particular system, in our study the metabolism of the human kidney, and its capacity for filtration of the contents of the blood. We applied this approach to retrospectively investigate potential causal drug targets leading to increased blood pressure in participants of clinical trials for the drug torcetrapib in an effort to display how our approach could be directly useful in the drug development process. Our results suggest specific metabolic enzymes that may be directly responsible for the side effect. The drug screening framework we have developed could be used to link adverse side effects to particular drug targets, discover new uses for old drugs, identify biomarkers for metabolic disease and drug response, and suggest genetic or dietary risk factors to help guide personalized patient care.
