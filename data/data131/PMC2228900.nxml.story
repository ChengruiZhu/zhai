We monitored intracellular pH (pHi) in isolated perfused S3 segments of the rabbit proximal tubule, and studied the effect of acetate (Ac-) transport on pHi. pHi was calculated from the absorbance spectrum of 4',5'-dimethyl-5-(and 6) carboxyfluorescein trapped intracellularly. All solutions were nominally HCO3(-)-free. Removal of 10 mM Ac- from bath and lumen caused pHi to rapidly rise by approximately 0.2, and then to decline more slowly to a value approximately 0.35 below the initial one. Removal of only luminal Ac- caused pHi changes very similar to those resulting from bilateral removal of Ac-. When Ac- was removed from bath only, pHi rose rapidly at first, and then continued to rise more slowly. Readdition of Ac- to bath caused pHi to rapidly fall to a value slightly higher than the one prevailing before the removal of Ac- from the bath. In experiments in which Ac- was first removed from both bath and lumen, readdition of 10 mM Ac- to only lumen caused a rapid but small acidification, followed by a slower alkalinization that brought the pHi near the value that prevailed before the bilateral removal of Ac-. The alkalinizing effects caused by the readdition of 10 or 0.5 mM Ac- were indistinguishable. When Ac- was returned to only lumen in the absence of luminal Na+, there was a small and rapid pHi decrease, but no pHi recovery. Removal of Na+ from bath did not affect the pHi transients caused by the addition of Ac- to lumen. In experiments in which Ac- was first removed bilaterally, readdition of Ac- to only bath caused a large and sustained drop in pHi, whereas the subsequent removal of Ac- from the bath caused a slight alkalinization. These pHi changes caused by readdition or removal of Ac- from baths were unaffected by the absence of external Na+. We conclude that there is a Na+/Ac- cotransporter at the luminal membrane, and pathways for acetic acid transport at both luminal and basolateral membranes. The net effect of Ac- transport on pHi is to alkalinize the cell as a result of the luminal entry of Na+/Ac-, which is followed by the luminal and basolateral exit of acetic acid.
