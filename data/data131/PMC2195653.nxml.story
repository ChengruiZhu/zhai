The activation of endothelium is important in recruiting neutrophils to sites of inflammation and in modulating their function. We demonstrate that conditioned medium from cultured, activated endothelial cells acts to significantly delay the constitutive apoptosis of neutrophils, resulting in their enhanced survival and increased phagocytic function. The antiapoptotic activity is, in part, attributable to granulocyte/macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) secreted by activated endothelial cells. The in vivo relevance of these findings was investigated in a cytokine-induced model of acute meningitis in mice. Peripheral blood neutrophils (PBNs) from mice with meningitis exhibited a delay in apoptosis compared with untreated mice. Furthermore, neutrophils recovered from the inflamed cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) exhibited enhanced survival compared with neutrophils isolated from the peripheral blood of the same animals. In unchallenged GM-CSFâ€“deficient mice, the apoptosis of circulating PBNs was similar to wild-type animals; however, after cytokine-induced meningitis, the delay in neutrophil apoptosis typically observed in wild-type mice was attenuated. In contrast, the apoptosis of neutrophils recovered from the CSF of mice of both genotypes was comparable. Taken together, these studies suggest that neutrophil apoptosis is regulated during an inflammatory response, in both intravascular and extravascular compartments. GM-CSF released by activated endothelium can act to increase neutrophil survival and function in the peripheral blood, whereas other factor(s) appear to perform this function in the extravascular space.
