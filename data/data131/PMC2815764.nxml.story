The female reproductive axis is the first major organ system of the body to fail with advancing age.
                    In addition to a permanent cessation of fertile potential, the loss of cyclic ovarian function in humans heralds the 
                    onset of menopause, which in turn underlies the emergence of a diverse spectrum of health issues in aging women. 
                    Recently, it was reported that bone marrow (BM) transplantation (BMT) into adult female mice conditioned a week 
                    earlier with highly cytotoxic drugs rescues ovarian function and fertility. Herein we show in mice receiving no 
                    prior conditioning regimen that once-monthly infusions of BM-derived cells retrieved from young adult female donors
                     bearing an enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) transgene sustain the fertile potential of aging wild-type females
                     long past their time of normal reproductive senescence. The fertility-promoting effects of female donor BM are observed 
                    regardless whether the infusions are initiated in young adult or middle-aged females. Although the mechanism by which BM 
                    infusions benefit the reproductive performance of aging females remains to be elucidated, the absence of EGFP-expressing 
                    offspring suggests that it does not depend on development of mature eggs derived from germline-committed cells in the donor
                     marrow. However, donor BM-derived somatic cells accumulate in the recipients, indicating efficient donor cell engraftment 
                    without prior conditioning. These findings provide a strong impetus to further explore development of adult stem cell-based
                     technologies to safely extend function of the female reproductive axis into advanced age without the need for toxic 
                    pre-conditioning protocols routinely used in other models of stem cell delivery.
