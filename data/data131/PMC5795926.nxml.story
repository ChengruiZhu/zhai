Glioma is a severe disease of the central nervous system. Although previous studies have identified the important role of the immune response in association with tumor intervention, it is still unknown whether PU.1, a transcription factor known for its role in myeloid differentiation and immune responses, is involved in the progression of glioma. In the present study, we found a significant increase in SPI1, the gene that encodes PU.1, in samples from patients with glioma. Through genotype-phenotype association analysis several candidate factors that may mediate the role of PU.1 in glioma were identified. To further validate the association between PU.1 and glioma we found that the expression of BTK, a potential target of PU.1, was also upregulated in patients with glioma. We also demonstrated that various biological pathways could be involved in PU.1-associated glioma by analyzing these potential targets in the Reactome database. These results provide evidence that PU.1 could serve a role in the progress of glioma through its transcriptional targets in multiple signaling pathways. Therefore, in addition to its role in hematopoietic linage development and leukemia, PU.1 appears to be involved in the regulation of glioma and potentially in other malignant cancers.
