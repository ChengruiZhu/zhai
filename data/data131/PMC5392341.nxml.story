Literature suggests that genetic variants associated with increased susceptibility to gastric cancer (GCa) are mostly located in genes involved in carcinogenesis and possibly tumor progression. Therefore, we hypothesize that high genetic susceptibility is also associated with prognosis of the patients. To test this hypothesis, we selected a total of 42 common genetic variants that were reportedly associated with GCa risk with a high level of evidence obtained from either genome-wide association studies (GWASs) or meta-analyses and performed survival analysis of patients used in a case-control analysis. We first used 1115 GCa cases and 1172 cancer-free controls of ethnic Han Chinese to construct a weighted genetic risk score (GRS). Then, we included 633 GCa cases with available clinical information, fit GRS in a fractional polynomial Cox proportional hazards regression model to investigate whether there is a dose-dependent effect of GRS on risk of death in survival analysis. Dynamic predictive value of genetic risk for prognosis was also calculated. The results showed that the increase of GRS had no effect on risk of death in these GCa patients. Compared with GCa patients with the medium GRS, there was no significant difference in survival in patients with either a low (
