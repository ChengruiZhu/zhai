Mammals display a fascinating behavioural proficiency, which is a remarkable feature given the number of muscles that need to be continuously coordinated. Understanding the processes that give rise to this level of performance has been the main focus of many researchers during the last century, but until now a comprehensive model is yet to be established. From a theoretical point of view, we believe that a key element to understanding mammalian behaviour lies in processes that occur during early development. During this stage, a great deal of information is laid down in neural circuits about the structure of the musculoskeletal system. We believe that this information is essential to achieve coordinated behaviour. In this paper, we propose a model that links three behaviours that appear at different stages of mammalian development. In order of appearance these behaviours are: spontaneous motor activity, spinal reflexes, and coordinated behaviours. Our model shows that the sensor and motor activity induced by spontaneous motor activity is sufficient to self-organize spinal reflexes. These circuits enclose core knowledge about the muscle interactions occurring in the musculoskeletal system. In addition, our model shows that coordinated behaviour can then be achieved simply by modulating the reflex circuits.
