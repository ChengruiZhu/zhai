TANK-binding kinase 1 (TBK1) plays an essential role in Toll-like receptor (TLR)– and retinoic acid–inducible gene I (RIG-I)–mediated induction of type I interferon (IFN; IFN-α/β) and host antiviral responses. How TBK1 activity is negatively regulated remains largely unknown. We report that TNF receptor-associated factor (TRAF)–interacting protein (TRIP) promotes proteasomal degradation of TBK1 and inhibits TLR3/4- and RIG-I–induced IFN-β signaling. TRIP knockdown resulted in augmented activation of IFN regulatory factor 3 (IRF3) and enhanced expression of IFN-β in TLR3/4- and RIG-I–activated primary peritoneal macrophages, whereas overexpression of TRIP had opposite effects. Consistently, TRIP impaired Sendai virus (SeV) infection–induced IRF3 activation and IFN-β production and promoted vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) replication. As an E3 ubiquitin ligase, TRIP negatively regulated the cellular levels of TBK1 by directly binding to and promoting K48-linked polyubiquitination of TBK1. Therefore, we identified TRIP as a negative regulator in TLR3/4- and RIG-I–triggered antiviral responses and suggested TRIP as a potential target for the intervention of diseases with uncontrolled IFN-β production.
