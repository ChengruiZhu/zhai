Pseudoangiomatous stromal hyperplasia (PASH) is an uncommon benign mesenchymal tumor of the breast. Majority occur as diffuse lesions, and diagnosis is often incidental or in a background of other breast pathologies. Bilaterality with multiple tumoral masses in giant breasts is a rarity. We report a 34-year-old nonlactating female with 2-year history of rapid progressive painless bilateral enlargement of the breasts following surgical excision of ill-defined breast lumps which were not subjected to histopathological evaluation a year earlier. Examination revealed bilateral nontender giant breasts extending to the umbilical area with masses which were not attached to overlying skin, Grade 2 pressure ulcers on the lateral posterior breast aspects bilaterally and peau dâ€™orange. There were no other palpable masses or lymph nodes. A clinical assessment of bilateral gigantomastia was made. Bilateral mastectomy revealed giant PASH which was confirmed with positive immunohistochemical reactivity for CD34 and vimentin. No other breast pathologies were seen with extensive sectioning. Diffuse multiple breast lesions with incomplete excision are associated with rapid growth in PASH as seen in this case. The presence of concurrent bilateral giant tumoral masses without any underlying breast pathology is a novelty. The mainstay of treatment in this case is mastectomy despite its benign nature.
