We present a rare case of traumatic bilateral asymmetric hip dislocation with pelvic fractures and a traumatic diaphragmatic hernia. A 53-year-old machinist was transferred to our emergency department with the suspicion of a bilateral hip dislocation after he was trapped between an elevator and the roof. Immediate closed reduction of the hips was not performed because of the expected risk of increasing hemodynamic instability with muscular relaxation. An emergent full-body computed tomography (CT) scan was made to assess injuries with need for further operative treatment. Thus, closed reduction of both hips was finally performed in the OR directly before the laparotomy for the diaphragmatic repair and the osteosynthesis of the anterior pelvic ring. A 12-month follow-up showed good general health condition with asymptomatic situation of the hip joints and the abdomen. The diagnostic work-up of patients with severe trauma is still debated, a randomized controlled trial showed no reduction of the in-hospital mortality with immediate full-body CT scan compared to a conventional radiological work-up. Traumatic hip dislocations (THDs) are always due to high-energy trauma and additional injuries are frequent. To attempt a closed reduction of THD, under general anesthesia can be life-threatening with unrecognized associated injuries. Therefore, THD can serve as selection criteria for immediate full-body CT scan to facilitate diagnosis and treatment of associated injuries sustained by the patient.
