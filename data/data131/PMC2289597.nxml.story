Previous studies have shown that microtubule-based organelle transport requires a membrane receptor but no kinesin-binding membrane proteins have been isolated. Chick embryo brain microsomes have kinesin bound to their surface, and after detergent solubilization, a matrix with an antibody to the kinesin head domain (SUK-4) (Ingold et al., 1988) bound the solubilized kinesin and retained an equal amount of a microsome protein of 160-kD. Similarly, velocity sedimentation of solubilized membranes showed that kinesin and the 160-kD polypeptide cosedimented at 13S. After alkaline treatment to remove kinesin from the microsomes, the same 160-kD polypeptide doublet bound to a kinesin affinity resin and not to other proteins tested. Biochemical characterization localized this protein to the cytoplasmic face of brain microsomes and indicated that it was an integral membrane protein since it was resistant to alkaline washing. mAbs raised to chick 160-kD protein demonstrated that it was absent in the supernatant and concentrated in the dense microsome fraction. The dense microsome fraction also had the greatest amount of microtubule-dependent motility. With immunofluorescence, the antibodies labeled the ER in chick embryo fibroblasts (similar to the pattern of bound kinesin staining in the same cells) (Hollenbeck, P. J. 1989. J. Cell Biol. 108:2335-2342), astroglia, Schwann cells and dorsal root ganglion cells but staining was much less in the Golgi regions of these cells. Because this protein is a major kinesin-binding protein of motile vesicles and would be expected to bind kinesin to the organelle membrane, we have chosen the name, kinectin, for this protein.
