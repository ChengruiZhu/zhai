The p53 protein is a sophisticated transcription factor that regulates dozens of target genes simultaneously in accordance with the cellular circumstances. Although considerable efforts have been made to elucidate the functions of p53-induced genes, a holistic understanding of the orchestrated signaling network repressed by p53 remains elusive. Here, we performed a systematic analysis to identify simultaneously regulated p53-repressed genes in breast cancer cells. Consequently, 28 genes were designated as the p53-repressed gene module, whose gene components were simultaneously suppressed in breast cancer cells treated with Adriamycin. A ChIP-seq database showed that p53 does not preferably bind to the region around the transcription start site of the p53-repressed gene module elements compared with that of p53-induced genes. Furthermore, we demonstrated that p21/CDKN1A plays a pivotal role in the suppression of the p53-repressed gene module in breast cancer cells. Finally, we showed that appropriate suppression of some genes belonging to the p53-repressed gene module contributed to a better prognosis of breast cancer patients. Taken together, these findings disentangle the gene regulatory network underlying the built-in p53-mediated tumor suppression system.
