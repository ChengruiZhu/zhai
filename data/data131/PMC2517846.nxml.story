Recent experimental findings (for example the ENCODE project) show that many functional non-coding regions of genomes are not conserved across species, making the in-silico discovery of such regions challenging. Transposable elements (TEs), which represent 45 percent of the human genome and typically show no sequence conservation, are particularly intriguing from this point of view, because the highly nonrandom genomic distribution of many TE families in genomes has led to hypotheses that their presence is adaptive and have an epigenetic (regulatory) function. We use a novel approach based on the analysis of interrupted TEs to investigate if repeats are under selection that does not rely on sequence conservation. L1 elements, the most active transposable elements of the human genome, are highly overrepresented on the X-chromosome and were suggested to enhance its inactivation in mammals. We find that the interruption pattern of L1 repeats indicates a function for L1 elements in the inactivation of the mammalian X chromosome. Additionally, we show that a considerable fraction of TEs in introns are under selection for integrity, possibly due to selection on intron size or on TEs themselves.
