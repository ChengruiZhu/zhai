The broad application of genome-scale metabolic modeling has made it a useful technique for tackling fundamental questions in biological research and engineering. Today over 100 models have been constructed for organisms that carry out a diverse array of metabolic activities spanning all three kingdoms of life. These models, however, have been curated independently following different conventions. The maintenance of model consistency has been challenging due to the lack of consensus in model representation and the absence of integrated modeling software for associating mathematical simulations with the annotation and biological interpretation of metabolic models. To solve this problem, we developed a new software package, PSAMM, and a new model format that incorporates heterogeneous, model-specific annotation information into modular representations of model definitions and simulation settings. PSAMM provides significant advances in standardizing the workflow of model annotation and consistency checking. Compared to existing tools, PSAMM supports more flexible configurations and is more efficient in running constraint-based simulations. All functions of PSAMM are freely available for academic users and can be downloaded from a public Git repository (
