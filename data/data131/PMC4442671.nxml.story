Through
the combination of reaction kinetics (both stoichiometric
and catalytic), solution- and solid-state characterization of arylpalladium(II)
arylsilanolates, and computational analysis, the intermediacy
of covalent adducts containing Si–O–Pd linkages in the
cross-coupling reactions of arylsilanolates has been unambiguously
established. Two mechanistically distinct pathways have been demonstrated:
(1) transmetalation via a neutral 8-Si-4 intermediate that dominates
in the absence of free silanolate (i.e., stoichiometric reactions
of arylpalladium(II) arylsilanolate complexes),
and (2) transmetalation via an anionic 10-Si-5 intermediate that dominates
in the cross-coupling under catalytic conditions (i.e., in the presence
of free silanolate). Arylpalladium(II) arylsilanolate
complexes bearing various phosphine ligands have been isolated, fully
characterized, and evaluated for their kinetic competence under thermal
(stoichiometric) and anionic (catalytic) conditions. Comparison of
the rates for thermal and anionic activation suggested, but did not
prove, that intermediates containing the Si–O–Pd linkage
were involved in the cross-coupling process. The isolation of a coordinatively
unsaturated, T-shaped arylpalladium(II) arylsilanolate
