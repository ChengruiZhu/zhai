For a cell to divide into two daughter cells, its genetic information must be accurately duplicated. The large genomes in eukaryotic cells are copied from hundreds or thousands of replication origins to achieve the duplication of the entire DNA in a limited time span. Errors that result in incomplete or multiple copying of parts of the genome can cause cancer in humans. To avoid such errors, the replication origins must be activated coherently across the genome, and repeated firing of already activated origins must be strictly prevented. We developed a kinetic model of the biochemical network that governs the initiation of DNA replication in yeast to understand how these functional properties are realized through the interaction of multiple molecular players. Our computational analysis shows that optimized kinetic parameters are required for the biological functionality of the network, and such parameters indeed account for the measured kinetics of replication initiation. We predict that both the near-synchronous start of replication and the robustness against DNA rereplication are supported by time delays caused by multiple regulatory protein phosphorylations. Our analysis suggests that the kinetic design of the DNA replication network represents an adaptation to multiple, and partially conflicting, functional requirements.
