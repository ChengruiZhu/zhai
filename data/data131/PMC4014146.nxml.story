We found that dioscin (0.25 μg/ml, 0.5 μg/ml, and 1.0 μg/ml) promoted MC3T3-E1 cells and MG-63 cells proliferation and differentiation dose dependently. Western blot analysis results showed that estrogen receptor α (ER-α), estrogen receptor β (ER-β), β-catenin and Bcl-2 protein expression increased after MC3T3-E1 cells were treated with dioscin. Quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) analysis indicated that dioscin could increase the ratio of osteoprotegerin (OPG)/receptor activator of NF-κB ligand (RANKL) and up-regulate the level of Lrp5 and β-catenin. And by RNA interference analysis, we proved that the effect of dioscin increasing the ratio of OPG/RANKL was dependent on Lrp5 pathway. In addition, we also found that these effects of dioscin were abolished by ICI 182, 780 (100 nM), an antagonist of ER, indicating that an ER signaling pathway was also involved. We also found that dioscin (0.25 μg/ml, 0.5 μg/ml, and 1.0 μg/ml) induced MG-63 cells proliferation and differentiation in a dose-dependent manner. Western blot analysis results indicated that ER-α, ER-β and β-catenin protein expression increased after MG-63 cells were treated with dioscin.
