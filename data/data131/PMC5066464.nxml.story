Malignant salivary gland tumours of the larynx are very rare, with limited reports of clinical outcomes. We present the decade-long experience of a single institution. A 10-year retrospective chart review of a tertiary head and neck cancer centre was performed. Index patients were identified from a review of a pathology database, and reviewed by a head and neck pathologist. Patient demographics, presenting signs and symptoms, treatment modalities and clinical outcomes were extracted from electronic medical records. Six patients were included, with an age range of 44 to 69. All six had malignant laryngeal salivary gland tumours. Pathologies included: three adenoid cystic carcinoma (2 supraglottic, 1 subglottic), one mucoepidermoid carcinoma (supraglottic), one epithelial-myoepithelial carcinoma (supraglottic) and one adenocarcinoma (transglottic). All were treated with surgery (2 endolaryngeal, 4 open) and five of six with the addition of adjuvant therapy (4 radiotherapy, 1 concurrent chemoradiation). One patient had smoking history; no patients had significant alcohol history. With 4.5 years of median follow-up, none of the patients has had recurrence or local/distant metastasis. Salivary gland tumours of the larynx present in mid to late-age, and can be successfully managed with a multi-modality approach, resulting in excellent local and regional control rates.
