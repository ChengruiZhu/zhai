This study was designed to explore the complementary effects of a combination formulation of olive oil, olive and fig fruits on RA remission indicators. A randomized controlled clinical trial was designed. Adult RA patients were randomly divided into two groups receiving routine Disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) regimen (control group) and routine DMARDs regimen plus the herbal supplementary formulation of olive oil, fig and olive fruits (intervention group). Patients were followed every 4 weeks for total study period of 16 weeks. In addition to demographic and medical history of the patients, the Disease Activity Score with 28-joint counts based on Erythrocyte Sedimentation Rate (DAS28_ESR) were recorded. SPSS (version 22.0) software was used to analyze data, assuming p<0.05 as significance level. 56 patients (control = 27 and intervention = 29), with mean ± sd age of 50.91 ± 12.26 years completed the study. Repeated measures analysis revealed that differences between remission indicators in the two study groups were not statistically significant, however, there was a p = 0.03 for the within-subjects contrast test of the Patient Global Assessment (PtGA), approving a nonlinear change for PtGA with respect to time. No between groups differences in adjunct drug therapy pattern for disease flares were seen. In conclusion, although, non-significant changes in the study variable of DAS28_ESR is in agreement with few previous reports, nevertheless, trends in its reduction in the intervention group along with the significant delayed PtGA score improvements occurred in the intervention group convince us to suggest further investigations on the supplementary olive and fig products, with a longer follow up periods.
