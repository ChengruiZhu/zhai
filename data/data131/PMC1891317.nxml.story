The researchers recruited people who had been in contact with active tuberculosis, did ELISPOT tests and TSTs at recruitment, then repeated the ELISPOT test after three months and both tests in some participants after 18 months. They analyzed how often ELISPOT conversion (a change from a negative to a positive result indicating the development of an active immune response) and reversion (a change from a positive to a negative result reflecting clearance of the bacteria or its entry into a dormant state) occurred, whether the TST results mirrored these changes, and which characteristics of the participants were associated with conversion or reversion. A quarter of participants who initially had a negative ELISPOT result had a positive result at three months, a conversion that was associated with a positive TST at recruitment. ELISPOT reversion at three months, by contrast, was associated with an initially negative TST and occurred in nearly half the participants. However, about a third of the participants had negative ELISPOT results at all three time points and a fifth had positive results at all times. Overall, the two tests agreed in 73% and 60% of the participants at recruitment and at 18 months, respectively. Finally, among the 13 contacts who developed active tuberculosis, some were initially positive in both tests but others showed subsequent conversion in one, both or neither test.
