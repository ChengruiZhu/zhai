Centromeres, which harbor the attachment points for microtubules during cell division, are characterized by repetitive DNA, paucity of genes, and almost complete suppression of crossing over. The repetitive DNA within centromeres appears to evolve much faster than would be expected for genetically inert regions, however. Current explanations for this rapid evolution tend to be theoretical. On the one hand there are arguments that subtle forms of selection on selfish repeat sequences can explain the rapid rate of change, while on the other hand it seems plausible that some form of accelerated neutral evolution is occurring. Here, we address this question in maize, which is known for its excellent genetic mapping resources. We first developed a method for identifying hundreds of single copy markers in centromeres and confirmed that they lie within functional domains by using a chromatin immunoprecipitation assay for kinetochore protein CENH3. All markers were mapped in relation to each other. The data show that, whereas classical crossing over is suppressed, there is extensive genetic exchange in the form of gene conversion (by which short segments of one chromosome are copied onto the other). These results were confirmed by demonstrating that similar short exchange tracts are common among the centromeres from multiple diverse inbred lines of maize. Our study suggests that centromere diversity can be at least partially attributed to a high rate of previously “hidden” genetic exchange within the core kinetochore domains.
