The purpose of this study was to determine interfractional variation of the centroid position and volume of internal target volume (ITV) during stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) of lung cancer. From January 2014 to August 2014, a total of 32 patients with 37 primary or metastatic lung tumors were enrolled in our study. All patients received SBRT treatment in 4â€“5 fractions to a median dose of 48 Gy. Both 3D CT and 4D CT scans were used for radiotherapy treatment planning. 3D CBCT was acquired prior to treatment delivery to verify patient positioning. A total of 163 3D CBCT images were available for evaluation. 3D CBCT scans acquired for verification were registered with simulation CT scans. The ITVs were contoured on all verification 3D CBCT scans and compared to the initial gross target volume (GTV) or ITV in treatment planning system. GTV was based on 3D CT while ITV was based on both 3D CT and 4D CT. To assess the interfractional variation of ITV centroid position, we used vertebrae body adjacent to the tumor as reference point when performing the registration procedure. To eliminate the effect of time on tumor volume between simulation CT scan and the first fraction, the interfractional variation of ITV was evaluated from the first fraction to the last fraction. The overall 3D vector shift was
