Cilia are small projections extending from the surface of most cells. Research has shown that they are important in diseases such as cystic kidney diseases as well as during the development of many tissues including the limb. More recently, proteins such as Polaris, which is required to build cilia, have been demonstrated to be essential for the regulation of Sonic hedgehog (Shh) signaling, although the mechanism has remained elusive. Precise regulation of Shh signal transduction is important for the proper development of many tissues. Excessive activation of the Shh pathway results in severe developmental defects and has been implicated in certain types of cancer. In the limb, Shh signaling is involved in digit development, and excess signaling leads to the formation of extra digits. The main targets of Shh signaling are the Glioma (Gli) family of transcription factors, and Gli3 has been shown to be processed to a shortened repressor form when Shh signaling is repressed. The localization of the Gli transcription factors and Suppressor of fused, a protein involved in the regulation of Gli protein function, to cilia suggests that the cilia may be an important site for regulation of Shh signal transduction by modulating Gli protein function.
