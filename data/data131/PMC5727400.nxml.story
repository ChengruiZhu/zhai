Tripal is an open-source database platform primarily used for development of genomic, genetic and breeding databases. We report here on the release of the Chado Loader, Chado Data Display and Chado Search modules to extend the functionality of the core Tripal modules. These new extension modules provide additional tools for (1) data loading, (2) customized visualization and (3) advanced search functions for supported data types such as organism, marker, QTL/Mendelian Trait Loci, germplasm, map, project, phenotype, genotype and their respective metadata. The Chado Loader module provides data collection templates in Excel with defined metadata and data loaders with front end forms. The Chado Data Display module contains tools to visualize each data type and the metadata which can be used as is or customized as desired. The Chado Search module provides search and download functionality for the supported data types. Also included are the tools to visualize map and species summary. The use of materialized views in the Chado Search module enables better performance as well as flexibility of data modeling in Chado, allowing existing Tripal databases with different metadata types to utilize the module. These Tripal Extension modules are implemented in the Genome Database for
