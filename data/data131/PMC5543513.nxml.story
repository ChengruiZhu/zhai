Myocardial ischaemia (MI) results in extensive cardiomyocyte death and reactive oxygen species (ROS)‐induced damage in an organ with little or no regenerative capacity. Although the use of adult bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BMMSCs) has been proposed as a treatment option, the high cell numbers required for clinical use are difficult to achieve with this source of MSCs, and animal studies have produced inconsistent data. We recently demonstrated in small and large animal models of acute MI that the application of human term placenta‐derived multipotent cells (PDMCs), a foetal‐stage MSC, resulted in reversal of cardiac injury with therapeutic efficacy. However, the mechanisms involved are unclear, making it difficult to strategize for therapeutic improvements. We found that PDMCs significantly reduced cardiomyocyte apoptosis and ROS production through the paracrine factors GRO‐α, HGF and IL‐8. Moreover, culturing PDMCs on plates coated with laminin, an extracellular matrix (ECM) protein, resulted in significantly enhanced secretion of all three paracrine factors, which further reduced cardiomyocyte apoptosis. The enhancement of PDMC paracrine function by laminin was mediated through αvβ3 integrin, with involvement of the signalling pathways of JNK, for GRO‐α and IL‐8 secretion, and PI3K/AKT, for HGF secretion. Our results demonstrated the utility of PDMC therapy to reduce cardiomyocyte apoptosis through modulation of ECM proteins in
