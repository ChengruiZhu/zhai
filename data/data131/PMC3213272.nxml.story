Skin complications and chronic non-healing wounds are common in obesity, metabolic disease and type 2 diabetes. Epidermal γδ T cells normally produce keratinocyte growth factors, participate in wound repair and are necessary for keratinocyte homeostasis. We have determined that in γδ T cell-deficient mice, there are reduced numbers of keratinocytes and the epidermis exhibits a flattened, thinner structure with fewer basal keratinocytes. This is important in obesity, where skin-resident γδ T cells are reduced and rendered dysfunctional. Similar to γδ T cell-deficient mice, keratinocytes are reduced and the epidermal structure is altered in two obese mouse models. Even in regions where γδ T cells are present, there are fewer keratinocytes in obese mice indicating that dysfunctional γδ T cells are unable to regulate keratinocyte homeostasis. The impact of absent or impaired γδ T cells on epidermal structure is exacerbated in obesity as E-cadherin localization and expression is additionally altered. These studies reveal that γδ T cells are unable to regulate keratinocyte homeostasis in obesity and that the obese environment further impairs skin structure by altering cell-cell adhesion. Together, impaired keratinocyte homeostasis and epidermal barrier function through direct and indirect mechanisms results in susceptibility to skin complications, chronic wounds and infection.
