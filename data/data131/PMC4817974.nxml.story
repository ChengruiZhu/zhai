 as a model system to address how progenitor cells form a three-dimensional organ. The fully formed intestine is a cylindrical tube of only 20 epithelial cells, and all of these cells are descendants of a single cell, the E blastomere. The E descendants form a primordium that changes shape over time as different E descendants divide and move. Cells in the primordium must continually adhere to each other during these movements to maintain the integrity of the primordium. Here, we generated a 3D graphic reconstruction of the developing intestine in order to analyze these events. We found that the cell movements are highly reproducible, suggesting that they are programmed by asymmetric gene expression in the primordium. In particular, we found that the conserved receptor LIN-12/Notch appears to modulate left-right adhesion in the primordium, leading to the asymmetric packing of cells. One of the most remarkable events in intestinal morphogenesis is the circumferential rotation of a subset of cells. We found that rotation appears to have a role in aligning the developing lumen of the intestine, and involves a conserved, UNC-6/netrin signaling pathway that is best known for its roles in the guided growth of neurons.
