Vitamin D deficiency has been associated with increased risks of prostate cancer. Nevertheless, the mechanisms remain unclear. The aim of this study was to analyze the association among prostate cancer, vitamin D status and inflammation. Sixty patients with newly diagnosed prostate cancer and 120 age-matched controls were recruited for this study. Vitamin D status was evaluated and serum inflammatory molecules were measured. Serum 25-(OH)D was lower in patients with prostate cancer. Moreover, serum 25(OH)D was lower in patients with severe prostate cancer than patients with mild and moderate prostate cancer. By contrast, serum C-reactive protein (CRP) and interleukin (IL)-8, two inflammatory molecules, were elevated in patients with prostate cancer. Serum 25-(OH)D was negatively correlated with serum CRP and IL-8 in patients with prostate cancer. Additional analysis showed that the percentage of vitamin D receptor positive nucleus in the prostate was reduced in patients with prostate cancer. By contrast, the percentage of nuclear factor kappa B p65-positive nucleus was elevated in patients with prostate cancer. Our results provide evidence that there is an association among prostate cancer, vitamin D deficiency and inflammatory signaling. Inflammation may be an important mediator for prostate cancer progression in patients with low vitamin D status.
