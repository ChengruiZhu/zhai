 of femoral heads), and dose profiles along the vertical and horizontal axis crossing the isocenter were determined using the single‐arc and double‐arc VMAT technique. For comparison, the monitor unit based on the RapidArc delivery method, prostate tumor control probability (TCP), and rectal normal tissue complication probability (NTCP) based on the Lyman‐Burman‐Kutcher algorithm were calculated. It was found that though the double‐arc technique required almost double the treatment time than the single‐arc, the double‐arc plan provided a better rectal and bladder dose‐volume criteria by shifting the delivered dose in the patient from the anterior–posterior direction to the lateral. As the femoral head was less radiosensitive than the rectum and bladder, the double‐arc technique resulted in a prostate VMAT plan with better prostate coverage and rectal dose‐volume criteria compared to the single‐arc. The prostate TCP of the double‐arc plan was found slightly increased (0.16%) compared to the single‐arc. Therefore, when the rectal dose‐volume criteria are very difficult to achieve in a single‐arc prostate VMAT plan, it is worthwhile to consider the double‐arc technique.
