Intermittent hypobaric hypoxia (IHH) has been the focus of important research in cardioprotection, and it has been associated with several mechanisms. Intermittent hypobaric hypoxia inhibits prolyl hydroxylases (PHD) activity, increasing the stabilization of hypoxia-inducible factor-1 (HIF-1) and activating crucial adaptative genes. It has been hence suggested that IHH might be a simple intervention, which may offer a thoughtful benefits to patients with acute myocardial infarction and no complications. Nevertheless, several doubts exist as to whether IHH is a really safe technique, with little to no complications in post-myocardial infarction patients. Intermittent hypobaric hypoxia might produce instead unfavourable changes such as impairment of vascular hemodynamics and hypertensive response, increased risk of hemoconcentration and thrombosis, cardiac rhythm perturbations, coronary artery disease and heart failure, insulin resistance, steatohepatitis and even high-altitude pulmonary oedema in susceptible or nonacclimatized patients. Although intermittent and chronic exposures seem effective in cardioprotection, IHH safety issues have been mostly overlooked, so that assorted concerns should be raised about the opportunity to use IHH in the post-myocardial infarction period. Several IHH protocols used in some studies were also aggressive, which would hamper their widespread introduction within the clinical practice. As such, further research is needed before IHH can be widely advocated in myocardial infarction prevention and recovery.
