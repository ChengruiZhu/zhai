Mammalian cells have cytoplasmic and mitochondrial aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases (ARSs) that catalyze aminoacylation of tRNAs during protein synthesis. Despite their housekeeping functions in protein synthesis, recently, ARSs and ARS-interacting multifunctional proteins (AIMPs) have been shown to play important roles in disease pathogenesis through their interactions with disease-related molecules. However, there are lacks of data resources and analytical tools that can be used to examine disease associations of ARS/AIMPs. Here, we developed an Integrated Database for ARSs (IDA), a resource database including cancer genomic/proteomic and interaction data of ARS/AIMPs. IDA includes mRNA expression, somatic mutation, copy number variation and phosphorylation data of ARS/AIMPs and their interacting proteins in various cancers. IDA further includes an array of analytical tools for exploration of disease association of ARS/AIMPs, identification of disease-associated ARS/AIMP interactors and reconstruction of ARS-dependent disease-perturbed network models. Therefore, IDA provides both comprehensive data resources and analytical tools for understanding potential roles of ARS/AIMPs in cancers.
