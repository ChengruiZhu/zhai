Heritable variation within a species provides the basis for natural and artificial selection. A substantial portion of heritable variation is based on alterations in DNA sequence among individuals and is termed genetic variation. There is also evidence for epigenetic variation, which refers to heritable differences that are not caused by DNA sequence changes. Methylation of cytosine residues provides one molecular mechanism for epigenetic variation in many eukaryotic species. The genome-wide distribution of DNA methylation was assessed in two different inbred genotypes of maize to identify differentially methylated regions that may contribute to epigenetic variation. There are hundreds of genomic regions that have differences in DNA methylation levels in these two different genotypes, including methylation differences in regions without genetic variation. By studying the inheritance of the differential methylation in near-isogenic progeny of the two inbred lines, it is possible to demonstrate relatively stable inheritance of epigenetic variation, even in the absence of DNA sequence changes. The epigenetic variation among individuals of the same species may provide important contributions to phenotypic variation within a species even in the absence of genetic differences.
