We report a case of a 53-year old patient with symptoms of congestive heart failure in whom a restrictive cardiomyopathy and a kappa-chain monoclonal gammopahty were diagnosed. Treatment with eight cycles of Bortezomib, a proteasome inhibitor, resulted in a significant regression of myocardial amyloid deposition and a notable clinical and hemodynamic improvement. Over the last few years, the management of cardiac amyloidosis has taken advantage of many of the advances of the chemotherapeutic regimens, as well as the wider availability of stem cell transplantation. The management of cardiac amyloidosis is also expected to evolve and improve with the better understanding of the specific mechanisms of amyloidogenesis and myocardial deposition. This will probably make certain molecules targeting specific sites in this process, as potentially effective and minimally toxic compared therapy with the currently used ones. In this article, we describe one of the first reported cases of cardiac amyloidosis, successfully treated with Bortezomib. We describe and discuss the mechanisms of action of Bortezomib and provide a detailed review of cardiac amyloidosis, from pathophysiology to diagnosis and treatment.
