About one-fifth of the protein-coding genes in the human genome code for secreted and/or membrane-bound proteins. In the nucleus these genes are transcribed into messenger RNAs (mRNAs), which are then exported to the cytoplasm. These mRNAs are then transported to the surface of the endoplasmic reticulum where they are translated into proteins destined for the secretory pathway. Most of these mRNAs contain signal sequence coding regions (SSCRs), which code for short hydrophobic polypeptides that target the newly synthesized proteins for translocation across the endoplasmic reticulum membrane. Previously, we found that many SSCRs also act as RNA elements that promote the efficient nuclear export of mRNAs. Here we present evidence that upon the completion of nuclear export, SSCR-containing mRNAs interact with RanBP2/Nup358, a large protein found on the cytoplasmic face of the nuclear pore. This interaction is mediated by direct binding between the SSCR and zinc finger repeats found within RanBP2/Nup358, and is ultimately required for the efficient translation of SSCR-containing mRNAs into secretory and/or membrane-bound proteins. Our work demonstrates that SSCRs act as nucleotide platforms that recruit various factors to the mRNA throughout its life to regulate distinct events, such as nuclear export and translation.
