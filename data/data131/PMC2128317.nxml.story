 therapy there is demonstrated a certain amount of diffusion of this activity, not shown by any other method of administration, C 40 and C 110 having about the same value as optochin. Intravenous injection of the drugs in small doses destroyed to a greater or less extent the natural defenses of the animal, optochin being perhaps less injurious than the aromatic compounds. This same destruction of natural resistance followed intraperitoneal and subcutaneous injections of the chemicals as measured by intravenous injections of the organisms. The maximum tolerant dose in a single injection (intraperitoneal) is not so efficacious as the same dose divided in fifths and injected at hour intervals. Optochin under these conditions is not so active as the aromatic compounds. In general, repeated doses are more curative than single. There is a zone between the therapeutic and toxic doses, both single and repeated, for all these chemicals alike, where the natural resistance of the animal to an infection is reduced. This effect is noted especially with C 29, C 36, and C 40. In the case of optochin the therapeutic dose is nearer the toxic than with C 110, C 36, and C 40. Apparently these chemicals exhibit a variability in
