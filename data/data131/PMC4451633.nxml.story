This study was aimed at developing a polymeric drug delivery system for a steroidal aromatase inhibitor, exemestane (exe) intended for sustained targeted delivery of drug through intravenous route. Carboxylated polycaprolactone (cPCL) was synthesized by ring opening polymerization of caprolactone. Exe-loaded cPCL nanoparticles (NPs) were prepared by interfacial deposition of preformed polymer and characterized. A 3-factor, 3-level Box–Behnken design was used to derive a second-order polynomial equation and construct contour and response plots for maximized response of percentage drug entrapment (PDE) with constraints on particle size (PS). The independent variables selected were ratio of exe/cPCL, amount of cPCL, and volume of organic phase. Polymerization of caprolactone to cPCL was confirmed by Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) and gel permeation chromatography. The prepared NPs were evaluated for differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and in vitro release studies. Optimum formulation based on desirability (1.0) exhibited PDE of 83.96 % and PS of 180.5 nm. Check point analysis confirmed the role of the derived polynomial equation and contour plots in predicting the responses. Zeta potential of optimized formulation was −33.8 ± 2.1 mV. DSC studies confirmed the absence of any interaction between drug and polymer. TEM image showed non-aggregated and spherical shaped NPs. Drug release from NPs showed sustained release and followed Korsmeyer–Peppas model, indicating Fickian drug release. Thus, preparation of exe-loaded cPCL NPs with high PDE and desired PS suitable for providing passive targeting could be statistically optimized using Box–Behnken design.
