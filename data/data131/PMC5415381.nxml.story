Chance fractures by definition are a type of flexion-distraction injury with concomitant vertebral body fracture. Although uncommon in the pediatric population, they are associated with motor vehicle accidents and typically involve the thoraco-lumbar spine. Injury occurs when the spine rotates about a fixed axis, such as a lap belt. Our case reports the management of a five-year-old girl involved in a head-on collision who suffered a purely ligamentous flexion-distraction injury (Chance-type injury, without bone involvement) at the L2-L3 vertebral level. Previously these injuries were managed conservatively with serial casting; however, we present a case in which surgical management was used. A five-year-old girl sustained multiple injuries after being involved in a high-speed motor vehicle accident. At presentation, there was obvious abdominal bruising with a seat-belt sign and marked kyphosis of the spine with severe tenderness at the L2-L3 level. She required immediate exploratory laparotomy for her intraabdominal injuries. After stabilization, an orthopedic consult was deemed necessary. She was found to have occipital-cervical injury with mild anterolisthesis of C2 on C3 and disruption of the apical ligament. There was evidence of bilateral dislocation of the L2-L3 facet joints with marked disruption of the posterior ligaments and a hematoma sack. She required open reduction and internal fixation with an L2-L3 laminectomy, pedicle screw and rod placement. The kyphotic deformity was reduced using a compression device and stable alignment was achieved intraoperatively.
