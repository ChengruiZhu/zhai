During the progression of epithelial cancer, the cells may lose epithelial markers and gain mesenchymal phenotype via Epithelial-Mesenchymal Transition (EMT). Such transformation of epithelial cancer cells to mesenchymal-like characteristic benefits plasticity and supports their ability to migrate. The aim of this study was to evaluate the influence of natural compound Caffeic Acid (CA) alone and in combination with antidiabetic drug Metformin (Met) on metastatic progression of two human cervical squamous cell cancer lines, C-4I and HTB-35/SiHa cells. EMT program was triggered by exposition of both epithelial cell lines to TGF-β1. Gene expression patterns related to epithelial/mesenchymal phenotype were evaluated by Real-Time PCR analysis and the protein amount was detected by western blot. The treatment of human squamous cancer cells with CA and with Met, suppressed the motility of cells and the effect depended on a particular cell line. Both compounds regulated the EMT process in C4-I and HTB-35 cells by interfering with different molecular targets. In TGF-β1-stimulated C4-I cells, CA suppressed the expression of mesenchymal transcription factor SNAI1 which resulted in enhanced expression of epithelial markers E-cadherin, Occludin and Claudin. Additionally, CA blocked
