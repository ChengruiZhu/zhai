Phagocytosis, the engulfment and digestion of cellular debris, is at the core of the regenerative response of the damaged tissue, because it prevents the spillover of toxic intracellular contents and is actively anti-inflammatory. In the brain, the professional phagocytes are microglia, whose dynamic processes rapidly engulf and degrade cells undergoing apoptosis—programmed cell death—in physiological conditions. Thus, microglia hold the key to brain regeneration, but their efficiency as phagocytes in the diseased brain is only presumed. Here, we have discovered a generalized response of microglia to apoptotic challenge induced by excitotoxicity and inflammation, in which they boost their phagocytic efficiency to account for the increase in apoptosis. To our surprise, this apoptosis/microglial phagocytosis coupling was lost in the hippocampus from human and experimental mesial temporal lobe epilepsy (MTLE), a major neurodegenerative disorder characterized by excitotoxicity, inflammation, and seizures. This uncoupling was due to widespread ATP release during neuronal hyperactivity, which “blinded” microglia to the ATP microgradients released by apoptotic cells as “find-me” signals. The impairment of phagocytosis led to the accumulation of apoptotic cells and the build-up of a detrimental inflammatory reaction. Our data advocates for systematic assessment of the efficiency of microglial phagocytosis in brain disorders.
