Image encryption technology is one of the main means to ensure the safety of image information. Using the characteristics of chaos, such as randomness, regularity, ergodicity, and initial value sensitiveness, combined with the unique space conformation of DNA molecules and their unique information storage and processing ability, an efficient method for image encryption based on the chaos theory and a DNA sequence database is proposed. In this paper, digital image encryption employs a process of transforming the image pixel gray value by using chaotic sequence scrambling image pixel location and establishing superchaotic mapping, which maps quaternary sequences and DNA sequences, and by combining with the logic of the transformation between DNA sequences. The bases are replaced under the displaced rules by using DNA coding in a certain number of iterations that are based on the enhanced quaternary hyperchaotic sequence; the sequence is generated by Chen chaos. The cipher feedback mode and chaos iteration are employed in the encryption process to enhance the confusion and diffusion properties of the algorithm. Theoretical analysis and experimental results show that the proposed scheme not only demonstrates excellent encryption but also effectively resists chosen-plaintext attack, statistical attack, and differential attack.
