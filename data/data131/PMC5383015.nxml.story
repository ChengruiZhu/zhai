A striking feature of evolving organisms is their ability to acquire novel characteristics that help them adapt in new environments. The origin and the conditions of such ability remain elusive and is a long-standing question in evolutionary biology. Recent theory suggests that organisms can evolve designs that help them generate novel features that are more likely to be beneficial. Specifically, this is possible when the environments that organisms are exposed to share common regularities. However, the organisms develop robust designs that tend to produce what had been selected in the past and might be inflexible for future environments. The resolution comes from a recent theory introduced by Watson and Szathm√°ry that suggests a deep analogy between learning and evolution. Accordingly, here we utilise learning theory to explain the conditions that lead to more evolvable designs. We successfully demonstrate this by equating evolvability to the way humans and machines generalise to previously-unseen situations. Specifically, we show that the same conditions that enhance generalisation in learning systems have biological analogues and help us understand why environmental noise and the reproductive and maintenance costs of gene-regulatory connections can lead to more evolvable designs.
