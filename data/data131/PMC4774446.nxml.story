B-cell lymphoma 9 (BCL9), a component of aberrantly activated Wnt signaling, is an important contributing factor to tumor progression. Our previous data indicated that downregulation of the tumor suppressor microRNA-30c (miR-30c) was a frequent pathogenetic event in prostate cancer (PCa). However, a functional link between miR-30c and BCL9/Wnt signaling, and their clinical and pathological significance in PCa, have not been well established. The present study demonstrated that miR-30c serves as a key negative regulator targeting BCL9 transcription in PCa cells. Ectopic expression of miR-30c was associated with reduced expression of Wnt pathway downstream targets, including c-Myc, cluster of differentiation 44 and sex determining region Y-box 9 in DU145 human PCa cells. Examination of clinical prostate specimens revealed higher levels of BCL9 expression in PCa compared with that in benign prostate tissues. After substantiating this finding by patient sample analysis, BCL9 expression or activity was observed to be closely correlated with PCa biochemical recurrence (BCR) and disease progression, whereas it was inversely associated with miR-30c. Furthermore, overexpression of BCL9 in PCa acted cooperatively with miR-30c low expression to predict earlier BCR in PCa. These findings indicate that inhibition of BCL9/Wnt signaling by miR-30c is important in the progression of PCa. Furthermore, the combined analysis of miR-30c and BCL9 may be valuable tool for prediction of BCR in PCa patients following radical prostatectomy.
