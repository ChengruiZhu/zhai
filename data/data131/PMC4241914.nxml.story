(AD). Although physical exercise and AD have received attention in the scientific literature, the mechanism through which treadmill exercise may impact the brain insulin signaling of AD has not been elucidated. This study aimed to evaluate the neuroprotective effects of treadmill exercise on apoptotic factors (Bcl-2/Bax ratio, caspase-3), HSP70, COX-2, BDNF and PI3-K/Akt signaling pathway in the cortex of NSE/hPS2m transgenic mice model of AD. Treadmill exercise ameliorated cognitive function in water maze test and significantly increased the level of Bcl-2/Bax ratio and HSP-70 in Tg-exe group compared to Tg-con group; on the other hand, it significantly decreased the expression of caspase-3 and COX-2 in Tg-exe group compared to Tg-con group. In addition, treadmill exercise significantly increased the expression of BDNF and PI3K/Akt in Tg-exe group compared to Tg-con group. Consequently, treadmill exercise improves cognitive function possibly via activating neurotrophic factor, BDNF and PI3k/Akt signaling pathway, and Aβ-induced neuronal cell death in the cortex of Tg mice was markedly suppressed following treadmill exercise. These results suggest that treadmill exercise may be beneficial in preventing or treating Alzheimer’s disease.
