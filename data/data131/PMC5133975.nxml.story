Altered expression of microRNA-590-5p (miR-590-5p) is involved in tumorigenesis, however, its role in colorectal cancer (CRC) remains to be determined. In this study, we focused on examining the effects of different expression levels of miR-590-5p in cancer cells and normal cells. Results showed that there are lower expression levels of miR-590-5p in human CRC cells and tissues than in normal control cells and tissues. Similarly, in our xenograft mouse model, knockdown of miR-590-5p promoted the progression of CRC. However, an overexpression of miR-590-5p in the mice inhibited angiogenesis, tumor growth, and lung metastasis. Nuclear factor 90 (NF90), a positive regulator of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) mRNA stability and protein synthesis, was shown to be a direct target of miR-590-5p. The overexpression of NF90 restored VEGFA expression and rescued the loss of tumor angiogenesis caused by miR-590-5p. Conversely, the NF90-shRNA attenuated the increased tumor progression caused by the miR-590-5p inhibitor. Clinically, the levels of miR-590-5p were inversely correlated with those of NF90 and VEGFA in CRC tissues. Furthermore, knockdown of NF90 lead to a reduction of pri-miR-590 and an increase of mature miR-590-5p, suggesting a negative feedback loop between miR-590-5p and NF90. Collectively, these data establish miR-590-5p as an anti-onco-miR that inhibits CRC angiogenesis and metastasis through a new mechanism involving NF90/VEGFA signaling axis, highlighting the potential of miR-590-5p as a target for human CRC therapy.
