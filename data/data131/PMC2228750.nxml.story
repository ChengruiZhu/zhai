Various aspects of the interrelationship between ion transport and cellular metabolism were investigated using a suspension of rabbit cortical tubules that were mainly proximal in nature. Using the intact tubules, the compartmentation of K within the renal cell was studied by performing 42K uptake studies. The oxygen consumption (QO2) of the tubules was measured under similar conditions, as well as when the Na pump was stimulated by increasing Na+ entry with nystatin. In addition, the state 3 rate of respiration was measured when the mitochondria of digitonin-permeabilized tubules were stimulated by ADP. At 37 and 25 degrees C, a single-compartmental uptake of 42K was observed, which suggests that extracellular K+ communicates with a single compartment within the renal cell. Between 37 and 15 degrees C, the ouabain- sensitive QO2 and the initial 42K uptake rate were parallel in an Arrhenius-type plot, which indicated that active ion transport and oxidative phosphorylation remain tightly coupled within this temperature range. At all temperatures between 37 and 15 degrees C, nystatin stimulated the QO2, which demonstrates that the entry of Na+ into the renal cells was rate limiting for active Na+ transport throughout this temperature range. Between 37 and 20 degrees C, the nystatin-stimulated QO2 was nearly equal to the state 3 rate of respiration, which suggests that active ion transport may be limited by ATP availability under these conditions. At 15 degrees C, nystatin addition stimulated the QO2 well below the state 3 respiratory rate.
