Liposarcoma in the spermatic cord is infrequent, and accurate diagnosis of histopathological subtype is often difficult in spite of the importance of differential diagnosis for adequate treatment. A 54-year-old man underwent left-sided high orchiectomy with inguinal lymphadenectomy for a spermatic cord tumor in July 2006. The initial histopathological report diagnosed leiomyosarcoma in the spermatic cord. He then underwent surgeries for repeated recurrences a further 6 times between July 2008 and May 2014. Pathological finding at the 7th resection of the recurrent tumor was osteosarcoma, which was uncommon in the spermatic cord. With a thorough overview of all specimens, the histopathological diagnosis was finally confirmed as dedifferentiated liposarcoma because of a biphasic pattern in the specimen of high orchiectomy at the first resection. A biphasic pattern represents high-grade sarcoma like osteosarcoma and well-differentiated liposarcoma, and is characteristic of dedifferentiated liposarcoma. Although the dedifferentiated type is one of poor prognosis, the diagnosing of liposarcoma histopathologically was found to be difficult throughout this case. In this report we discuss the accurate histopathological diagnosis of liposarcoma in the spermatic cord in order to prevent repeated recurrences based on a review of the literature, as well as the difficulty in recognizing dedifferentiated liposarcoma macroscopically and morphologically. Our experience suggests that, after much difficulty, accurate histopathological diagnosis of liposarcoma in the spermatic cord is still clinically challenging.
