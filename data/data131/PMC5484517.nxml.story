Two scenarios have been proposed to describe the history of cellular life on our planet. For some authors, two lineages emerged from the last universal cellular ancestor, one leading to Bacteria, the other one leading to a common ancestor of Archaea and Eukarya (Woese’s hypothesis), while others suggest that Eukaryotes emerged from within an archaeal subgroup (eocyte hypothesis). This latter hypothesis has been boosted by the reconstruction of new archaeal genomes from environmental DNA. These analyses have suggested that eukaryotes originated from complex archaea, called Lokiarchaeota, the first described members of the recently proposed Asgard superphylum. Considering the importance of this question, we performed new analyses of the universal proteins from Lokiarchaea and realized that their affiliation to Eukaryotes was most probably due to different biases, including chimeric sequences and unequal rate of protein evolution. From our results, we suggest here that Lokiarchaea and close relatives are sister group to Euryarchaeota, not to Eukarya. Notably, we also show that the choices of the universal markers to include in one’s analysis will critically impact the scenario supported and that some markers as the RNA polymerase support the traditional Woese’s tree.
