The ubiquity and relevance of extracellular DNA (exDNA) are well-known and increasingly gaining importance in many fields of application such as medicine and environmental microbiology. Although sources and types of exDNA are manifold, ratios of specific DNA-molecules inside and outside of living cells can give reliable information about the activity of entire systems and of specific microbial groups or species. Here, we introduce a method to discriminate between internal (iDNA), as well as bound and free exDNA, and evaluate various DNA fractions and related ratios (ex:iDNA) regarding their applicability to be used as a fast, convenient, and reliable alternative to more tedious RNA-based activity measurements. In order to deal with microbial consortia that can be regulated regarding their activity, we tested and evaluated the proposed method in comparison to sophisticated dehydrogenase- and RNA-based activity measurements with two anaerobic microbial consortia (anaerobic fungi and syntrophic archaea and a microbial rumen consortium) and three levels of resolution (overall activity, total bacteria, methanogenic archaea). Furthermore, we introduce a 28S rRNA gene-specific primer set and qPCR protocol, targeting anaerobic fungi (
