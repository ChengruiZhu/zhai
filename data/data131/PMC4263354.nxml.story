The chemotaxis system allows bacteria to respond to minute changes in chemical concentration, and serves as a paradigm for biological signal processing and the self-assembly of large protein lattices in living cells. The sensitivity of the chemotaxis system relies crucially on cooperative interactions among chemoreceptor trimers, which are organized into intricate honeycomb lattices. Chemoreceptors are membrane proteins and, hence, are expected to deform the surrounding lipid bilayer, leading to membrane-mediated interactions between chemoreceptor trimers. Using a biophysical model of bilayer-chemoreceptor interactions we show that the membrane-mediated interactions induced by chemoreceptor trimers provide a mechanism for the observed self-assembly of chemoreceptor lattices. We find that the directionality of membrane-mediated interactions between trimers complements protein-protein interactions in the stabilization of the observed honeycomb architecture of chemoreceptor lattices. Our results suggest that the symmetry of membrane protein complexes such as chemoreceptor trimers is reflected in the anisotropy of membrane-mediated interactions, yielding a general mechanism for the self-assembly of ordered protein lattices in cell membranes.
