To study the processes of thymic development, we have established transgenic mice expressing and alpha/beta T cell antigen receptor (TCR) specific for cytochrome c associated with class II major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules. The transgenic TCR chains are expressed by most of the thymocytes in these mice, and these cells have been shown to efficiently mature in association with Ek- and Ab- encoded class II MHC molecules. This report describes a characterization of the negative selection of these transgenic thymocytes in vivo that is associated with the expression of As molecules. Negative selection by As molecules appears to result in the deletion of a late stage of CD4/CD8 double-positive thymocytes in that there is a virtual absence of transgenic TCR bearing CD4 single- positive thymocytes. This phenotype is accompanied by the appearance of CD4/CD8 double-negative thymocytes and peripheral T cells that are functionally antigen reactive. The process of negative selection has also been investigated using an in vitro culture system. Upon presentation of cytochrome c by Eb-expressing nonthymic antigen- presenting cells, there occurs an antigen dose-dependent deletion of the majority of CD4/CD8 double-positive thymocytes. In contrast, presentation of Staphylococcal enterotoxin A by Eb in vitro results in minimal deletion of double-positive thymocytes. In addition, we use this in vitro model to examine the effects of cyclosporin A on negative selection. In contrast to its effects on mature T cells, and the findings of others in vivo, cyclosporin A does not inhibit antigen- induced deletion of double-positive thymocytes. Finally, a comparison of the antigen dose responses for thymocyte deletion and for peripheral T cell activation indicates that double-positive thymocyte recognition is more sensitive than mature T cells to antigen recognition.
