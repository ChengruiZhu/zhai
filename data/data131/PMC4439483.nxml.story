Henoch-Sch√∂nlein purpura (HSP) is a small vessel systemic vasculitis, predominantly affecting children, characterized by a tetrad of manifestations, specifically palpable purpura, arthralgia, abdominal pain, and renal disease. HSP in the adult population is rare, and no case has been described of HSP in liver cirrhosis with spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP). We present the case of a 58-year-old male with liver cirrhosis, who was subsequently diagnosed with SBP and later HSP. In this patient, the diagnosis of HSP was demonstrated clinically by his palpable purpura, diarrhea, hematuria, and abdominal pain and confirmed pathologically by his renal and skin biopsies demonstrating leukocytoclastic vasculitis and IgA complexes. We believe that this is an example of altered IgA processing in cirrhosis leading to the development of IgA immune complexes and ultimately HSP. The patient additionally had SBP, which may have increased his risk for developing HSP given antigen processing by mucosa-associated lymphoid tissues leading to immune complex deposition, which may not have been effectively cleared in the context of his liver disease. The patient unfortunately died of gastrointestinal hemorrhage, which is unclear to be due to his underlying cirrhosis or a gastrointestinal manifestation of HSP itself.
