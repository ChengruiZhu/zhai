An osteo-odonto-keratoprosthesis (OOKP) procedure is indicated in patients with failed corneal transplant but having intact retina for visual improvement. We studied perioperative concerns of patients who underwent the staged OOKP procedure. This was a retrospective analysis of patients who underwent OOKP. The information regarding symptoms, associated comorbidities, perioperative events including anaesthetic management were collected. Eight patients (five females and three males) underwent the staged OOKP procedure. The median age was 18 years. The median weight was 45 kg. The median duration of loss of vision was 4 years. The aetiology of blindness included Stevens-Johnson's syndrome (SJS) (7) and chemical burn (1). Four patients had generalized skin problem due to SJS. All cases were managed under general anaesthesia, and airway management included nasotracheal intubation for stage I and orotracheal intubation for stage II. The median mallampati classification was I prior to OOKP stage I procedure while it changed to II at stage II procedure. Two patients required fibreoptic nasotracheal intubation. One patient had excessive oozing from the mucosal harvest site and was managed conservatively. In one patient, tooth harvesting was done twice as the first tooth was damaged during creating a hole in it. We conclude that OOKP requires multidisciplinary care. Anaesthesiologist should evaluate the airway carefully and disease-associated systemic involvements. The use of various drugs requires caution and steroid supplementation should be done. Airway difficulty should be anticipated, mandating thorough evaluation. Re-evaluation of airway is prudent as it may become difficult during the staged OOKP procedure.
