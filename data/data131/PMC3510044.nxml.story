Pre-messenger RNA splicing is the process by which an intron is identified and removed from a transcript and the protein-coding exons are ligated together. It is carried out by the spliceosome, a large and dynamic molecular machine that catalyzes the splicing reaction. It is now apparent that most splicing occurs while the transcript is still engaged with RNA polymerase, implying that the biologically relevant splicing substrate is chromatin-associated. Here, we used a genetic approach to understand which factors participate in the coordination of transcription and splicing. Having recently shown that the Npl3 protein is involved in the recruitment of splicing factors to chromatin-associated transcripts, we performed a systematic screen for genetically interacting factors. Interestingly, we identified factors that influence the ubiquitin modification of histone H2B, a mark involved in transcription initiation and elongation. We show that disruption of the H2B ubiquitination/de-ubiquitination cycle results in defects in splicing, particularly in the absence of Npl3. Furthermore, the ubiquitin ligase, Bre1, shows genetic interactions with other, more canonical spliceosomal factors. Taken together with the myriad Npl3 interaction partners we found, our data suggest an extensive cross-talk between the spliceosome and chromatin.
