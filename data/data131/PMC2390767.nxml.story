The targeted inactivation of oncogenes may be a specific and effective treatment of cancer. However, how oncogene inactivation leads to tumor regression is not clear. Previously, we have shown that even the brief inactivation of the MYC oncogene can result in the sustained regression of at least some tumors. To understand the mechanism, we have utilized several novel genomic analyses to define a set of genes that strongly correlate with the ability of the MYC oncogene to maintain tumorigenesis. First, we generated a novel data set from microarray analyses of murine tumors that we analyzed by StepMiner to identify discrete step changes in gene expression after the inactivation or the reactivation of the MYC oncogene. Second, we utilized Boolean Network Analysis to further define the subset of genes highly correlated with MYC in human tumorigenesis. Third, we utilized ChIP analysis to demonstrate that in many cases the permanent changes of gene expression we uncovered were associated with changes in the ability of MYC to occupy the promoter locus. Our general strategy could be similarly utilized in other experimental model systems to understand how specific oncogenes contribute to the maintenance of tumorigenesis.
