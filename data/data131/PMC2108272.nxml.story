 The intranuclear spindle of yeast has an electron-opaque body at each pole. These spindle plaques lie on the nuclear envelope. During mitosis the spindle elongates while the nuclear membranes remain intact. After equatorial constriction there are two daughted nuclei, each with one spindle plaque. The spindle plaque then duplicates so that two side-by-side plaques are produced. These move rapidly apart and rotate so that they bracket a stable 0.8 µm spindle. Later, during mitosis, this spindle elongates, etc. Yeast cells placed on sporulation medium soon enter meiosis. After 4 hr the spindle plaques of the more mature cells duplicate, producing a stable side-by-side arrangement. Subsequently the plaques move apart to bracket a 0.8 µm spindle which immediately starts to elongate. When this meiosis I spindle reaches its maximum length of 3–5 µm, each of the plaques at the poles of the spindle duplicates and the resulting side-by-side plaques increase in size. The nucleus does not divide. The large side-by-side plaques separate and bracket a short spindle of about 1 µm which elongates gradually to 2 or 3 µm. Thus there are two spindles within one nucleus at meiosis II. To the side of each of the four plaques a bulge forms on the nucleus. The four bulges enlarge while the original nucleus shrinks. These four developing ascospore nuclei are partially surrounded by cytoplasm and by a prospore wall which originates from the cytoplasmic side of the spindle plaque. Eventually the spore nuclei pinch off and the spore wall closes. In some of the larger yeast cells this development is completed after 8 hr on sporulation medium.
