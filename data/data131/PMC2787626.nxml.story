Two important aspects of drug development are drug target identification and biomarker discovery for early disease detection, disease progression, drug efficacy and drug toxicity, etc. Recently, many single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with human diseases are discovered through large genome-wide association studies (GWAS). However, it is still largely unclear how these candidate SNPs may cause human diseases. The ultimate aim of this paper is to put these GWAS candidate SNPs and their associated genes into a network context to understand their mechanism of action in human diseases. In addition to large-scale human data sets that are often heterogeneous in terms of genetic and environmental factors, many high quality data sets in rodents exist and are frequently used to model human diseases. To leverage such information, we developed a method for combining and contrasting gene networks between human and rodents, specifically to elucidate how GWAS candidate SNPs may contribute to human diseases. By identifying mechanisms that are conserved or divergent between human and rodents, we can also predict which disease causal genes can be studied using rodent models and which ones may not.
