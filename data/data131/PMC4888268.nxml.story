Schwannomas rarely occur in the retroperitoneum, and are normally not aggressive. Preoperative diagnosis is difficult and the surgeon may confront blood vessels, nerves or organs damage, since the intra-operative findings are various. The diagnosis and treatment of malignant schwannomas in the retroperitoneum are even more challenging. In addition, the prognosis of malignant schwannomas is extremely poor. The present study reports the case of a 52-year-old woman who presented with a 6-month history of an abdominal mass in the left lower quadrant. The local doctor determined a preliminary diagnosis of abdominal giant tumor and referred the patient to the First Affiliated Hospital, Medical School of Xi'an Jiaotong University, (Xi'an, China). Following discussion, the patient underwent a surgical resection. Low-grade malignant schwannoma was diagnosed following histological examination. No evidence of recurrence or any other complication was observed at the 18-month follow-up examination. The present study reports a case of giant retroperitoneal schwannoma (RS), and includes a literature review in order to provide an overview of the diagnosis, treatment and prognosis of RS and discuss preoperative management strategies for the disease.
