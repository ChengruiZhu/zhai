EMT represents the dominant program within advanced stages of colon cancer, where cells acquire migratory characteristics in order to invade secondary tissues and form metastasis. Where the majority of the therapeutic strategies are concentrated on the reduction of the tumor mass through different apoptotic mechanisms, the present study advocates an important role for miR-205-5p in impairment of colon cancer cells migration and restoration of the epithelial phenotype. Upon identification of a homogenous downregulated profile for miR-205-5p in colon adenocarcinoma patients, functional studies demonstrated that experimental upregulation of this sequence is able to significantly raise the levels of E-cadherin through direct inhibition of ZEB1. Moreover, the elevation in CDH1 expression was translated into functional parameters where cells lost their invasion and migratory characteristics and formed homogenous clusters through adhesion interactions. Survival analysis of colon adenocarcinoma patients revealed that low levels of miR-205-5p are associated with an unfavorable prognostic compared to those with increased expression, demonstrating the possible clinical utility of miR-205-5p replacement. Exogenous administration of miRNA mimics was not associated with significant changes in cell viability or inflammatory pathways. Therefore, the proposed strategy is aiming towards inhibition of metastasis and limitation of the tumor borders in advanced stages patients in order to prolong the survival time and to increase the efficiency of the current therapeutic strategies.
