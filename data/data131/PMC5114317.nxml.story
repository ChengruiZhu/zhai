Computational modelling is a cornerstone of Comprehensive In Vitro Proarrhythmia Assay and is re-increasingly being used in drug development. Electrophysiological effects of drug-drug interactions can be predicted in silico, e.g. with the use of in vitro cardiac ion channel data, PK profiles and human ventricular cardiomyocyte models. There are, however, several approaches with different assumptions used to assess the combined effect of multiple drugs, and there is no agreed standard interaction model. The aim of this study was to assess whether the choice of the drug-drug interaction (DDI) model (Bliss independence, Loewe additivity, or simple sum) influences the results of QT interval simulation trial. The Simcyp Simulator version 12.1 (Simcyp Ltd. [part of Certara], Sheffield, UK) and Cardiac Safety Simulator 2.0 (Simcyp Ltd. [part of Certara], Sheffield, UK) were used to simulate results of 8 virtual trials mimicking clinical studies and generate individual QTc data. The combined effect of inhibitory actions of drugs which were given simultaneously was calculated with use of three different interaction models. The PD effect of DDI was assessed and the differences between mean observed and mean predicted Î”QTcB values for terfenadine interactions were not statistically significant in all but one cases. Differences between the three DDI models are not statistically significant, implying that the choice of the DDI model, in the case of lack of synergy or antagonism, is irrelevant to the average predicted effect at the clinical level. However, in some cases, it can influence the verdict on combinatorial therapy safety for individual patients.
