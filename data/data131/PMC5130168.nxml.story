To provide personalized health care it is important to understand patients’ genomic variations and the effect these variants have in protecting or predisposing patients to disease. Several projects aim at providing this information by manually curating such genotype-phenotype relationships in organized databases using data from clinical trials and biomedical literature. However, the exponentially increasing size of biomedical literature and the limited ability of manual curators to discover the genotype-phenotype relationships “hidden” in text has led to delays in keeping such databases updated with the current findings. The result is a bottleneck in leveraging valuable information that is currently available to develop personalized health care solutions. In the past, a few computational techniques have attempted to speed up the curation efforts by using text mining techniques to automatically mine genotype-phenotype information from biomedical literature. However, such computational approaches have not been able to achieve accuracy levels sufficient to make them appealing for practical use. In this work, we present a highly accurate machine-learning-based text mining approach for mining complete genotype-phenotype relationships from biomedical literature. We test the performance of this approach on ten well-known diseases and demonstrate the validity of our approach and its potential utility for practical purposes. We are currently working towards generating genotype-phenotype relationships for all PubMed data with the goal of developing an exhaustive database of all the known diseases in life science. We believe that this work will provide very important and needed support for implementation of personalized health care using genomic data.
