 1. Gelatin solutions have a high viscosity which in the case of freshly prepared solutions varies under the influence of the hydrogen ion concentration in a similar way as the swelling, the osmotic pressure, and the electromotive forces. Solutions of crystalline egg albumin have under the same conditions a comparatively low viscosity which is practically independent of the pH (above 1.0). This difference in the viscosities of solutions of the two proteins seems to be connected with the fact that solutions of gelatin have a tendency to set to a Jelly while solutions of crystalline egg albumin show no such tendency at low temperature and pH above 1.0. 2. The formul√¶ for viscosity demand that the difference in the order of magnitude of the viscosity of the two proteins should correspond to a difference in the relative volume occupied by equal masses of the two proteins in the same volume of solution. It is generally assumed that these variations of volume of dissolved proteins are due to the hydration of the isolated protein ions, but if this view were correct the influence of pH on viscosity should be the same in the case of solutions of gelatin, of amino-acids, and of crystalline egg albumin, which, however, is not true. 3. Suspensions of powdered gelatin in water were prepared and it was found, first, that the viscosity of these suspensions is a little higher than that of gelatin solutions of the same concentration, second, that the pH influences the viscosity of these suspensions similarly as the viscosity of freshly prepared gelatin solutions, and third, that the volume occupied by the gelatin in the suspension varies similarly as the viscosity which agrees with the theories of viscosity. It is shown that this influence of the pH on the volume occupied by the gelatin granules in suspension is due to the existence of a Donnan equilibrium between the granules and the surrounding solution.
