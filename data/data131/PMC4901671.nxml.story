Fifty-four patients, 18 to 33 years of age, undergoing a primary, unilateral ACLR were enrolled between November 2012 and December 2013. Demographic characteristics and a series of validated psychosocial and outcome measures were collected preoperatively. Patient expectations for having a successful surgery were assessed with a 10-item numeric rating scale. Fear of movement was measured with the activity avoidance and somatic focus subscales from the 13-item Tampa Scale for Kinesiophobia, pain catastrophizing with the Pain Catastrophizing Scale, depressive symptoms with the Patient Health Questionnaire-9, and general and knee-specific self-efficacy with the Generalized Self-Efficacy Scale and Knee Self-Efficacy Scale. Return to sport was assessed with the Subjective Patient Outcome for Return to Sport (SPORTS) and sports function and knee-specific QOL were assessed with the Knee injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS) subscales. Patients completed an identical set of outcome instruments at 6 months after surgery. Separate multivariable linear regression analyses were used to examine the association between preoperative psychosocial variables and patient-reported outcomes at 6 months after ACLR, controlling for age, education, and preoperative outcome score.
