Organisms alter genes expression programs in response to changes in their environment. Such programs can specify fast induction, slow relaxation, oscillations, etc. Conceivably these kinetic outputs may depend on proper orchestration of the various phases of gene expression, including transcription, translation, and mRNA decay. In particular, in the transcriptomes of a broad range of species, fast mRNA “spikes” appear to result from surprisingly “pressing the gas and the brakes” together, i.e. by activating both transcription and degradation of same transcripts. A recently discovered molecular mechanism, in which subunits of RNA polymerase II (Pol II) associate to mRNAs during transcription and control their decay, could explain how such transcription-decay counter-action works. Yet, how such potential coupling responds to physiological conditions and how it shapes transcriptome kinetics remain unknown. Here we used a minimalist mutation in yeast RNA Pol II that is defective in the above mechanism in order to show that Pol II governs the ability of the cell to modulate mRNA decay in stress and, most importantly, that Pol II is essential for appropriate coupling between mRNA production and degradation. We further show that this transcription-decay coupling is responsible for shaping the transcriptome kinetic profiles under changing environmental conditions.
