The purpose of this study is to find the uncertainties in the reconstruction of MR compatible ring‐tandem intracavitary applicators of high‐dose rate image‐based brachytherapy treatment planning using rigid registration of 3D MR and CT image fusion. Tandem and ring reconstruction in MR image based brachytherapy planning was done using rigid registration of CT and MR applicator geometries. Verifications of registration for applicator fusion were performed in six verification steps at three different sites of tandem ring applicator set. The first site consists of three errors at the level of ring plane in (1) cranio–caudal shift (Cranial Shift) of ring plane along tandem axis, (2) antero–posterior shift (AP Shift) perpendicular to tandem axis on the plane containing the tandem, and (3) lateral shift (Lat Shift) perpendicular to the plane containing the tandem at the level of ring plane. The other two sites are the verifications at the tip of tandem and neck of the ring. The verification at the tip of tandem consists of two errors in (1) antero–posterior shift (AP Shift) perpendicular to tandem axis on the plane containing the tandem, and (2) lateral shift (Lat Shift) perpendicular to the plane containing the tandem. The third site of verification at the neck of the ring is the error due to the rotation of ring about tandem axis. The impact of translational errors from −5 mm to 5 mm in the step of 1 mm along x‐, y‐, and z‐axis and three rotational errors about these axes from −19.1° to 19.1° in the step of 3.28° on dose‐volume histogram parameters (
