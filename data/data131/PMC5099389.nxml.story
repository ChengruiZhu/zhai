Angiogenesis is a clue process for tissue development and function, both in normal and pathological conditions. This process is regulated by multiple molecular systems. One of the most potent is vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and its receptor (VEGFR) system. Members of this family are involved in new vessel formation in embryogenesis and maturation, as well as in reparative or pathological reactions in later stages. They play a substantial role in regeneration, inflammation, wound healing, as well as in cancer pathology. Nowadays it is possible to modulate VEGF-VEGFR interactions in many pathological conditions using anti-VEGF therapy. This therapy has already achieved a grounded position in the management of rheumatological disorders, tumour progression, and metastasis. Such drugs as bevacizumab, ranibizumab, aflibercept, and pegaptanib have also proven to be very effective in the treatment of several ocular diseases, such as age-related macular degeneration (AMD), macular oedema, or proliferative retinopathies and iris neovascularisation. The indications for the application of this therapy in ophthalmology are becoming wider and wider. It may also be used for corneal pathologies and in anti-glaucoma procedures.
