Parkinson disease is an age-associated neurodegenerative disorder characterized by the loss of dopamine-producing neurons from a region in the brain known as the substantia nigra and by the accumulation of the protein alpha-synuclein in intracellular clumps called inclusions. Whether these inclusions are the cause or a consequence of the pathological processes is still unclear. Sirtuin proteins are considered master regulators of the ageing process and have previously been associated with neurodegeneration. In this study, we investigated the interplay between sirtuin 2 and alpha-synuclein in order to dissect the molecular mechanisms associated with protection against alpha-synuclein toxicity. We found that sirtuin 2 interacted with and removed acetyl groups from alpha-synuclein. By decreasing the levels of sirtuin 2, or by expressing mutant versions of alpha-synuclein that modulate its acetylation status, we found that acetylation reduces the aggregation of alpha-synuclein and its cytotoxicity in vitro. Next, we evaluated whether genetic inhibition of sirtuin 2 could prevent the deleterious effects of alpha-synuclein in vivo and found that, in two different models of Parkinson disease, deletion of sirtuin 2 was neuroprotective. Our data therefore suggest that strategies aimed at decreasing sirtuin 2 activity might prove valuable therapeutic avenues for intervention in Parkinson disease and other synucleinopathies.
