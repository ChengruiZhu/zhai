Peptide mapping is a component of the analytical toolbox used within the biopharmaceutical industry to aid in the identity confirmation of a protein therapeutic and to monitor degradative events such as oxidation or deamidation. These methods offer the advantage of providing site-specific information regarding post-translational and chemical modifications that may arise during production, processing or storage. A number of such variations may also be induced by the sample preparation methods themselves which may confound the ability to accurately evaluate the true modification levels. One important focus when developing a peptide mapping method should therefore be the use of sample preparation conditions that will minimize the degree of artificial modifications induced. Unfortunately, the conditions that are amenable to effective reduction, alkylation and digestion are often the same conditions that promote unwanted modifications. Here we describe the optimization of a tryptic digestion protocol used for peptide mapping of the NISTmAb IgG1Îº which addresses the challenge of balancing maximum digestion efficiency with minimum artificial modifications. The parameters on which we focused include buffer concentration, digestion time and temperature, as well as the source and type of trypsin (recombinant vs. pancreatic; bovine vs porcine) used. Using the optimized protocol we generated a peptide map of the NISTmAb which allowed us to confirm its identity at the level of primary structure.
