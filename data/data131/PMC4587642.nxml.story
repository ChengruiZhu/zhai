To dissect the role of vascular endothelial growth factor receptor-2 (VEGFR2) in Müller cells and its effect on neuroprotection in diabetic retinopathy (DR), we disrupted VEGFR2 in mouse Müller glia and determined its effect on Müller cell survival, neuronal integrity, and trophic factor production in diabetic retinas. Diabetes was induced with streptozotocin. Retinal function was measured with electroretinography. Müller cell and neuronal densities were assessed with morphometric and immunohistochemical analyses. Loss of VEGFR2 caused a gradual reduction in Müller glial density, which reached to a significant level 10 months after the onset of diabetes. This observation was accompanied by an age-dependent decrease of scotopic and photopic electroretinography amplitudes and accelerated loss of rod and cone photoreceptors, ganglion cell layer cells, and inner nuclear layer neurons and by a significant reduction of retinal glial cell line–derived neurotrophic factor and brain-derived neurotrophic factor. Our results suggest that VEGFR2-mediated Müller cell survival is required for the viability of retinal neurons in diabetes. The genetically altered mice established in this study can be used as a diabetic animal model of nontoxin-induced Müller cell ablation, which will be useful for exploring the cellular mechanisms of neuronal alteration in DR.
