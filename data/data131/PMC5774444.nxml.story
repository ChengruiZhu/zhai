The study aim was to evaluate the association of the expression of serum microribonucleic acid-590 (miR-590) with the risk of lung squamous cell carcinoma (LUSC), clinicopathological staging and prognosis. A total of 237 patients with LUSC and 100 healthy volunteers (control group) were included in the study. Total RNA was extracted from the peripheral blood serum of the subjects, and the expression level of miR-590 was detected by reverse transcription real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction. The baseline clinicopathological information of LUSC patients was evaluated, and the patients were followed up with the median follow-up of 47 months. Compared with that in the control group, the expression level of serum miR-590 in LUSC patients was significantly decreased [0.532 (0.367- 0.821) vs. 1.63 (0.893–1.347), P<0.001]. The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve showed that the value of predicting LUSC risk using miR-590 was high, the area under curve (AUC) was 0.883, and 95% confidence interval (CI) was 0.829–0.934. In addition, the expression level of serum miR-590 was correlated with pathological staging (P=0.022), lymph node metastasis (P=0.012), distant metastasis (P<0.001) and tumor, node and metastasis (TNM) staging (P=0.044). The overall survival (OS) of patients in the serum miR-590 low expression group was significantly lower than that of the serum miR-590 high expression group (P=0.012), and the low expression of miR-590 was an independent risk factor for the prognosis of patients [hazard ratio (HR)=2.152, 95% CI=1.285–3.233, P=0.004]. The results suggested that the expression level of miR-590 can be used as a biomarker for the risk of disease, disease staging and prognosis of LUSC patients.
