During cell division, replicated DNA molecules are pulled to daughter cells by microtubules, which originate at the spindle poles and attach to a multiprotein complex, the kinetochore. The kinetochore assembles at a special region of the chromosome, termed the centromere. The kinetochore is comprised of more than 50 different proteins whose precise functions are far from being fully understood. The kinetochore assembles on the foundation of a specialized centromeric nucleosome. A nucleosome is a complex of eight subunits, termed histones, which compacts the DNA by wrapping it around itself in 1.7 turns of a superhelix. The centromeric nucleosome is very special, and its stoichiometry and structure are a subject of intense debate. It is believed that the centromeric nucleosome is devoid of histone H3 and instead contains its variant, termed CENP-A in vertebrates or Cse4 in budding yeast. Here we report that in budding yeast both CENP-A and histone H3 localize to a small centromeric DNA fragment that, due to its size, cannot accommodate more than a single nucleosome. Our results necessitate a revision of what is known about the structure of the inner kinetochore and the role of CENP-A in its assembly.
