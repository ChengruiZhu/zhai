In the embryonic heart, the primitive atrium is considered to receive the bilateral sinus horns including the upper terminal of the inferior vena cava (IVC). To reveal topographical anatomy of the embryonic venous pole of the heart, we examined horizontal serial paraffin sections of 15 human embryos with crown-rump length 9-31 mm, corresponding to a gestational age of 6-7 weeks or Carnegie stage 14-16. The IVC was often fixed to the developing right pulmonary vein by a mesentery-like fibrous tissue. Rather than the terminal portion of the future superior vena cava, the IVC contributed to form a right-sided atrial lumen at the stage. The sinus venosus or its left horn communicated with the IVC in earlier specimens, but in later specimens, the left atrium extended caudally to separate the sinus and IVC. In contrast, the right atrium consistently extended far caudally, even below the sinus horn, along the IVC. A small (or large) attachment between the left (or right) atrium and IVC in adult hearts seemed to be derived from the left (or right) sinus valve. This hypothesis did not contradict with the incorporation theory of the sinus valves into the atrial wall. Variations in topographical anatomy around the IVC, especially of the sinus valves, might not always depend on the stages but partly in individual differences.
