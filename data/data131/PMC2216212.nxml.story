Na- and Cl-dependent glycine transport was investigated in human red blood cells. The effects of the carrier substrates (Na, Cl, and glycine) on the glycine transport kinetics were studied with the goal of learning more about the mechanism of transport. The K1/2-gly was 100 microM and the Vmax-gly was 109 mumol/kg Hb.h. When cis Na was lowered (50 mM) the K1/2-gly increased and the Vmax-gly decreased, which was consistent with a preferred order of rapid equilibrium loading of glycine before Na. Na-dependent glycine influx as a function of Na concentration was sigmoidal, and direct measurement of glycine and Na uptake indicated a stoichiometry of 2 Na:1 glycine transported. The sigmoidal response of glycine influx to Na concentration was best fit by a model with ordered binding of Na, the first Na with a high K1/2 (greater than 250 mM), and the second Na with a low K1/2 (less than 10.3 mM). In the presence of low Cl (cis and trans 5 mM), the K1/2-gly increased and the Vmax-gly increased. The Cl dependence displayed Michaelis-Menten kinetics with a K1/2-Cl of 9.5 mM. At low Cl (5 mM Cl balanced with NO3), the glycine influx as a function of Na showed the same stoichiometry and Vmax-Na but a decreased affinity of the carrier for Na. These data suggested that Cl binds to the carrier before Na. Experiments comparing influx and efflux rates of transport using red blood cell ghosts indicated a functional asymmetry of the transporter. Under the same gradient conditions, Na- and Cl-dependent glycine transport functioned in both directions across the membrane but rates of efflux were 50% greater than rates of influx. In addition, the presence of trans substrates modified influx and efflux differently. Trans glycine largely inhibited glycine efflux in the absence or presence of trans Na; trans Na largely inhibited glycine influx and this inhibition was partially reversed when trans glycine was also present. A model for the binding of these substrates to the outward- facing carrier is presented.
