Variations in compositionally ordered (CO) sections of proteins, such as amino acid runs, tandem repeats and low complexity regions, are often considered as a third type of genomic variation along with SNP and CNV. At the microevolutionary scale, they are involved in the rapid evolution of numerous biological functions and the development of novel phenotypic complex traits, including disease in human, in particular neurodegeneration and cancer. At the macroevolutionary scale, the best discriminating proteomic factor between super-kingdoms is the prevalence of CO proteins in eukaryotes. The analysis of CO structures has so far been quite eclectic. Here we introduce a novel unifying methodology, accounting for all types of low-complexity regions and repetitive phenomena, including the existence of large periodic structures in protein sequences. We define new CO measures providing insights into the correlation of CO with protein function and with evolution. In particular, a large-scale analysis of 94 proteomes shows that the CO vocabulary of frequently appearing amino acid triplets serves as a measure of taxonomic ordering separating major clades from each other. It unravels a missing genomic correlate of macroevolution and serves as a novel phylogenetic tool. This suggests that major CO generation occurs during the creation of a completely new species, i.e. during macroevolutionary events.
