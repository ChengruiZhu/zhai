 receptor. Exploiting pH differences in the cell, CaM performs a variety of functions by conveniently adopting different conformational states. We aim to reveal pH and ionic strength (IS) dependent shifts in the populations of conformational substates by modulating electrostatic interactions amongst the different regions of the protein and with its vicinal water. For this purpose, we design extensive molecular dynamics simulations to classify the effects that are responsible for adopting different conformations exhibited in the ensemble of NMR structures reported. Lowering the IS or pH, CaM experiences higher inter-lobe orientational flexibility caused by extreme change in the non-specific ion distribution in the vicinal solvent. Amongst the titratable groups sensitive to pH variations, E31 is unique in that its protonation has the same effect on the vicinal layer as increasing the IS. Furthermore, E31A mutation causes a large, reversible conformational change compatible with NMR ensemble structures populating the linker-kinked conformations. The mutation in the N lobe, at a significant distance, both modulates the electrostatic interactions in the central linker and alters the EF-hand helix orientations in the C lobe.
