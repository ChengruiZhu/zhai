Hinokitiol (β-thujaplicin) is a tropolone-related compound that has anti-microbe, anti-inflammation, and anti-tumor effects. Cancer stem/progenitor cells (CSCs) are a subpopulation of cancer cells with tumor initiation, chemoresistant, and metastatic properties and have been considered the important therapeutic target in future cancer therapy. Previous studies reported that hinokitiol exhibits an anti-cancer activity against murine tumor cells through the induction of autophagy. The current research revealed that hinokitiol suppressed the self-renewal capabilities of human breast CSCs (BCSCs) and inhibited the expression of BMI1 at protein level without suppressing its mRNA. Treatment of hinokitiol in mammospheres induced the expression of miR-494-3p and inhibition of miR-494-3p expression in BCSCs. This treatment abolished the suppressive effects of hinokitiol in mammosphere formation and BMI1 expression. BMI1 is a target of miR-494-3p by luciferase-based 3′UTR reporter assay. Overexpression of miR-494-3p in BCSCs caused the down-regulation of BMI1 protein, inhibition of mammosphere forming capability, and suppression of their tumorigenicity. Moreover, miR-494-3p expression was significantly and inversely correlated with patient survival in two independent public database sets. Furthermore, treatment of hinokitiol
