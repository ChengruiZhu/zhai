Pulmonary arteriovenous Malformations (PAVMs) are a rare vascular alteration characterized by abnormal communications between the pulmonary arteries and veins resulting in an extracardiac right-to-left (R-L) shunt. The majority of PAVMs are associated with an autosomal dominant vascular disorder also known as Osler-Weber-Rendu Syndrome. PAVMs appearance can be both single and multiple. Clinical manifestations include hypoxemia, dyspnea cyanosis, hemoptysis and cerebrovascular ischemic events or abscesses. We report a case of an 18 year old female with severe respiratory failure caused by a relapse of multiple unilateral pulmonary arterovenous fistula. Symptoms at admission include dyspnea, cyanosis and clubbing. The patient underwent pulmonary angio-TC scan, brain CT and echocardiography. The thoracic angio-CT scan showed the presence of PAVMs of RUL and RLL; a marked increase of right bronchial artery caliber and its branches with an aneurismatic dilatation was also observed. The patient underwent percutaneous transcatheter embolization using Amplatzer Vascular Plug IV; a relevant clinical and functional improvement was subsequently recorded. Embolization is effective in the treatment of relapsing PAVMS.
