Lung cancer is one of the leading causes of cancer-related death. Resistance to chemotherapy and molecularly targeted therapies is a major problem that can contribute substantially to high mortality. The roles of long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) in drug resistance of lung cancer are insufficiently understood. Here, we identified a distinct drug resistance-related transcriptional signature and constructed a functional lncRNA-mRNA co-expression network. We found that 34 lncRNAs and 103 mRNAs have differential expression in drug resistance of lung cancer, in which 10 lncRNAs were down regulated and 24 up regulated; 49 mRNAs were down regulated and 54 up regulated. LncRNAs-mRNAs expression network analysis revealed a role for lncRNAs in modulating cancer-related pathways. We also found that two pair lncRNAs and their subnetworks were highly related to drug resistance. NR_028502.1/NR_028505.1 were found differentially co-expressed with nine mRNAs, and highly correlated with better clinical outcome. NR_030725.1/NR_030726.1 co-expressed with eleven mRNAs, and were associated with poor survival in patients with lung cancer. Our work comprehensively identified expression signature of resistance-associated lncRNAs and their inter-regulated mRNAs in lung cancer.
