The genome in eukaryotic cells is packaged into nucleosomes, which play critical roles in regulating where and when different genes are expressed. For example, nucleosomes can physically block access of transcription factor to sites on DNA or direct regulatory proteins to DNA. Consistent with these roles, nucleosomes assume a stereotypical pattern around genes: they are depleted at the promoter region that marks the start of genes and assume a regularly spaced array within genes. To identify factors involved in this organization, we generated high-resolution nucleosome and transcriptome maps for 50 loss-of-function mutants with known or suspected roles in nucleosome biology in budding yeast. We show that nucleosome organization is determined by the combined effects of many factors that often exert opposing forces on nucleosomes. We further demonstrate that specific nucleosomes can be positioned independently within genes and that repositioning of nucleosomes at the start of genes may affect expression of these genes in response to environmental stimuli. Data mining of this extensive resource allowed us to show that general transcription factors act as insulators at diverging promoters to prevent the formation of cryptic transcripts, and also revealed 36 novel transcripts regulated by the Tup1/Cyc8 complex.
