A relational database has been developed and refined to allow for detailed analyses of data streams and surveillance systems. To maximize the utility of the database and facilitate one-stop-shopping for biosurveillance system information, we have expanded our scope to include not only biosurveillance systems, but also data sources, tools, and biosurveillance collectives. Captured in the information collected about the resource (if available) is the name and acronym of the resource, the date the resource became available, the accessibility of the resource (is it open to all, or are there limitations to access), the primary sponsors, if the resource is associated with GIS functionality, and if the focus is health. Also collected is contact information, information regarding the scope and domain of the resource, the pertinent diseases or disease categories, and the geographic and population coverage of the resource. Websites associated with the resource are directly accessible from the database. Data stream information is also captured based on our developed data stream framework. If the resource uses other specified systems/sources/tools for data gathering or analysis, then that is also captured and directly linked within the database.
