We related social factors with the annual rate of emergency medical admissions using census small area statistics. All emergency medical admissions (70,543 episodes in 33,343 patients) within the catchment area of St. Jamesâ€™s Hospital, Dublin, were examined between 2002 and 2016. Deprivation Index, Single-Parent status, Educational level and Unemployment rates were regressed against admission rates. High deprivation areas had an approximately fourfold (Incidence Rate Ratio (IRR) 4.0 (3.96, 4.12)) increase in annual admission rate incidence/1000 population from Quintile 1(Q1), from 9.2/1000 (95% Confidence Interval (CI): 9.0, 9.4) to Q5 37.3 (37.0, 37.5)). Single-Parent families comprised 40.6% of households (95% CI: 32.4, 49.7); small areas with more Single Parents had a higher admission rate-IRR (Q1 vs. for Q5) of 2.92 (95% CI: 2.83, 3.01). The admission incidence rate was higher for Single-Parent status (IRR 1.50 (95% CI: 1.46, 1.52)) where the educational completion level was limited to primary level (Incidence Rate Ratio 1.45 (95% CI: 1.43, 1.47)). Small areas with higher educational quintiles predicted lower Admission Rates (IRR 0.85 (95% CI: 0.84, 0.86)). Social factors strongly predict the annual incidence rate of emergency medical admissions.
