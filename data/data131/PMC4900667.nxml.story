How cells regulate the size and number of their protrusions for efficient polarity and motility is a fundamental question in cell biology. We recently found that immune cells known as neutrophils use physical forces to regulate this process. Actin polymerization-based protrusion stretches the plasma membrane, and this increased membrane tension acts as a long-range inhibitor of actin-based protrusions elsewhere in the cell. Here we investigate how membrane tension limits protrusion. We demonstrate that the magnitude of actin network assembly in neutrophils is determined by a mechanosensory biochemical cascade that converts increases in membrane tension into decreases in protrusion. Specifically, we show that increasing plasma membrane tension acts through a pathway containing the phospholipase D2 (PLD2) and the mammalian target of rapamycin complex 2 (mTORC2) to limit actin network assembly. Without this negative feedback pathway, neutrophils exhibit larger leading edges, higher membrane tension, and profoundly defective chemotaxis. Mathematical modeling indicates that this feedback circuit is a favorable topology to enable competition between protrusions during neutrophil polarization. Our work shows how biochemical signals, physical forces, and the cytoskeleton can collaborate to generate large-scale cellular organization.
