In patients unsuitable for radiocephalic fistula creation, the next option is brachiocephalic fistula. In such patients, we exploited the venous interconnections in the cubital fossa for median cubital vein-Brachiocephalic arteriovenous fistula (AVF) creation. In this article, we describe our experience in the creation of such technical variant of the brachiocephalic fistula AVF, its success and associated complications. A retrospective review of such AVF created between September 2014 and August 2015 was done. The data collected included demographics, co-morbidities, basic disease, operative details, patency, complications, and mortality. A total of 68 vascular access surgeries were done which included 26 (38.2%) brachiocephalic AVF using the median antecubital vein. The mean cephalic vein diameter and mean flow rate were 7.18 mm and 1415 ml/min, respectively 2 months after fistula creation. The primary and secondary failure rates were 3.87% and 7.69% respectively. Complications included aneurysm (7.69%), edema (19.23%), hematoma (11.53%), and wound infection (3.8%). Using reverse flow in the median antecubital vein is a safe and simple way to perform brachiocephalic AVF before brachiobasilic AVF and grafts.
