Chemotherapy represents an important treatment modality for lung adenocarcinoma. Thymidylate synthase (TS) is an essential enzyme in DNA synthesis, and its overexpression has been associated with reduced sensitivity to antifolate agents. The aim of the current study was to investigate the expression of TS and the effect on prognosis in lung adenocarcinoma patients. Adenocarcinoma and adjacent carcinoma tissues were resected from 100 patients with lung adenocarcinoma and the TS levels were detected by immunohistochemical analysis. The values for overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS) were determined using the Kaplan-Meier analysis. The results indicated that the TS protein was expressed predominantly in adenocarcinoma tissues, which exhibited higher TS expression compared with the adjacent tissues (P<0.001). The statistical analysis indicated that TS expression was associated with the clinical stage and history of smoking (P<0.05). The Kaplan-Meier analysis results indicated that the DFS and OS in patients with high TS expression levels were significantly shorter compared with those with low expression levels (P<0.05). In conclusion, the results from this study suggested that TS may serve as an independent predictive factor for survival rate, which may indicate the prognosis of lung adenocarcinoma patients.
