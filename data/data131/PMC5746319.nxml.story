 leaves (HZL) and is a natural antioxidant. However, the effects of HZL on DM and its mechanisms of action remain undefined. The present study evaluated the anti-hypoglycemic and hepatocyte-protective effects of HZL in mice with diabetes induced by a high-carbohydrate/high-fat diet (HFD) and alloxan. We also aimed to eludicate the underlying mechanisms. Our resutls demonstrated that the administration of HZL significantly reduced body weight gain, serum glucose levels and insulin levels in diabetic mice compared with the vehicle-treated mice. In addition, the levels of dyslipidemia markers including total cholesterol, triglyceride and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol in the HFD-treated mice were markedly decreased. Further experiments using hepatocytes from mice revealed that HZL significantly attenuated liver injury associated with DM compared with vehicle treatment, as evidenced by lower levels of alanine aminotransferase and aspartate aminotransferase in serum and by lower levels of lipid peroxidation, nitric oxide content and inducible nitric oxide synthase activity in liver tissues. Nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) and mitogen-associated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathways were investigated to elucidate the molecular mechanisms responsible for the protective effects of HZL against diabetic liver injury. The results indicated that HZL inhibited the phosphorylation of p65/NF-κB, MAPK (including p38, JNK and ERK1/2) and activating transcription factor 3 protein expression, with an additional suppression of Bax, cytochrome
