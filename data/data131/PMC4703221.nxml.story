A widely accepted notion is that the insula, especially its posterior portion, plays a specific role in the perception of pain. This has led a number of researchers to consider activity recorded from this so-called “ouch zone” as an objective correlate of pain perception. We provide compelling evidence to the contrary. Using direct intracerebral recordings, we demonstrate that painful and nonpainful stimuli elicit very similar responses throughout the human insula. This observation argues against the notion that these responses reflect the brain activity through which pain emerges from nociception in the human brain. These findings have implications for basic theories, as well as for the development of diagnostic tests and the identification of therapeutic targets for the treatment of chronic pain. They question the use of these insular responses to assess the effects of pharmacological treatment or to assess pain in patients unable to communicate. Furthermore, they have legal implications, as they contradict the proposal that these responses could be used to determine unequivocally whether plaintiffs are truly experiencing the pain for which they are seeking redress. Finally, they undermine the rationale for neurosurgical procedures aiming at alleviating pain by targeting the posterior insula.
