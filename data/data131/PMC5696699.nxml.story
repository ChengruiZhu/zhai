Vascular lesions of the central nervous system are one of the most important and topical problems in modern neuro-pathology. Bulgaria is among the first in morbidity and mortality from cerebrovascular diseases. Because of the significant medical and social importance of this pathology resulting in severe disabling of most survivors, we aimed to explore the effectiveness of kinesitherapeutic methodology applied in the recovery of a patient with ischemic stroke. We present a case of a 69-old patient admitted in the Neurological Ward of “St. George Hospital in Plovdiv in 2015, Bulgaria with right hemiparesis due to ischemic stroke in the basin of the left middle cerebral artery. The applied Kinesi-therapeutic methodology included various techniques like Kabat’s Bobath’s methods as well as training in equilibrium and walking. The patient obtained satisfactory results in terms of movement of the body and preserving the equilibrium, improvement of voluntary movement of the upper and lower right limb achieved via the help of some compensatory mechanisms. Despite the applied Kinesitherapy, the patient failed to gain independence in daily activities. We ascribe this satisfactory recovery only to the short period of application of kinesitherapeutic methodology. For a better recovery of patients with cerebrovascular disease, a continuous multidisciplinary approach is needed.
