The Research Methods involved Mapping Exercises with estimation of Service Loads and Qualitative Research Methods (QRM) like In-Depth Interviews (IDIs), Key Informant Interviews (KIIs), Free Listing and Focused Group Discussions (FGDs). The results indicate uneven availability of mental health services, human resource deficit specially for non-medical mental health professionals and mental health service gap (82% to96%). The average service load in the specialist mental health services is largely carried by the Govt. sector (half to two thirds), followed by the private sector (one third to half), with only a small portion by the NGO sector. The average mental health service load in the primary care general health services is largely carried by the private sector, with significant contribution from the non-formal service providers. The barriers to access, unmet needs and possible strategies as perceived by the community, users and service providers have been identified. The findings are discussed in the context of the mental health programmes and the public policy issues. The implications of the conclusions which suggest that Urban Mental Health Services are far from complete are highlighted.
