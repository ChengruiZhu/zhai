 stage presented with the complaints of weakness, dyspnea, arthralgia, neuropathic pains and pedal edema which are prominent symptoms of Chronic kidney disease. Our healthcare team had visited patient’s home and analyzed the available reports on kidney profile, fasting sugar, post prandial sugar, HbA1c, lipid profile test and prescriptions which was found to be high. The glomerular filtration rate, serum creatinine and blood urea were 24 ml/min, 3.4 mg/dL and 90 mg/dL, fasting blood sugar, post prandial blood sugar and HbA1c were 226, 305 and 7.4 %, and total cholesterol and triglycerides were 145 & 95 respectively. Further discussion on diet, it came to know that the patient was on high carbohydrate diet. By considering the objective and subjective data, our team had done the assessment and come to a conclusion that high amount of carbohydrate diet with poor medication adherence had led to the hyperglycemia which developed diabetic nephropathy. We have recommended low protein, unsaturated fat, multivitamins, antioxidants and moderate carbohydrate diet. Two dietary assessment tools had been used in order to monitor patient’s adherence to the diet i.e. dietary record book and food frequency questionnaire.
