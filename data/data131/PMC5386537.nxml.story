Accumulated evidence has suggested that microRNAs (miRNAs) have an important role in tumor development and progression by regulating diverse signaling pathways. However, the precise role of miRNAs in gastric cancer (GC) has not been elucidated. In this study, we describe the function and regulation network of miR-491-5p in GC. miR-491-5p is frequently downregulated in GC tissues compared with adjacent non-cancerous tissues. Forced expression of miR-491-5p significantly inhibits proliferation and colony formation, and promotes apoptosis in GC cells. Through bioinformatic analysis and luciferase assays, we confirm that miR-491-5p targets Wnt3a. Silencing Wnt3a inhibits cell proliferation and induces apoptosis. Similarly, restoration of Wnt3a counteracts the effects of miR-491-5p expression. Moreover, bioinformatic and luciferase assays indicate that the expression of miR-491-5p is regulated by Foxi1, which binds to its promoter and activates miR-491-5p expression. In conclusion, to the best of our knowledge, our findings are the first to demonstrate that Foxi1 is a key player in the transcriptional control of miR-491-5p and that miR-491-5p acts as an anti-oncogene by targeting Wnt3a/
