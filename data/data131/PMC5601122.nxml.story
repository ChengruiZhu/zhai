We have previously reported overexpression of antiapoptotic MCL-1 protein in human oral cancers and its association with therapy resistance and poor prognosis, implying it to be a potential therapeutic target. Hence, we investigated the efficacy and mechanism of action of Obatoclax, a BH3 mimetic pan BCL-2 inhibitor in human oral cancer cell lines. All cell lines exhibited high sensitivity to Obatoclax with complete clonogenic inhibition at 200â€“400 nM concentration which correlated with their MCL-1 expression. Mechanistic insights revealed that Obatoclax induced a caspase-independent cell death primarily by induction of a defective autophagy. Suppression of autophagy by ATG5 downregulation significantly blocked Obatoclax-induced cell death. Further, Obatoclax induced interaction of p62 with key components of the necrosome RIP1K and RIP3K. Necrostatin-1 mediated inhibition of RIP1K significantly protected the cells from Obatoclax induced cell death. Moreover, Obatoclax caused extensive mitochondrial stress leading to their dysfunction. Interestingly, MCL-1 downregulation alone caused mitochondrial stress, highlighting its importance for mitochondrial homeostasis. We also demonstrated
