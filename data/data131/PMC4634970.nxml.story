A basic task for animals is to track objects—predators, prey, even their own limbs—as they move through the world. Because the position estimates provided by the senses are not error-free, higher levels of performance can be, and are, achieved when the velocity and acceleration, as well as the position, of the object are taken into account. Likewise, tracking of limbs under voluntary control can be improved by considering the motor command that is (partially) responsible for its trajectory. Engineers have built tools to solve precisely these problems, and even to learn dynamical features of the object to be tracked. How does the brain do it? We show how artificial networks of neurons can learn to solve this task, simply by trying to become good predictive models of their incoming data—as long as some of those data are the activities of the neurons themselves at a fixed time delay, while the remainder (imperfectly) report the current position. The tracking scheme the network learns to use—keeping track of past positions; the corresponding receptive fields; and the manner in which they are learned, provide predictions for brain areas involved in tracking, like the posterior parietal cortex.
