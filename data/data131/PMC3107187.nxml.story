Epistasis, the extent to which the effects of a mutation depend on its genetic context, can have profound effects on the evolutionary process and strongly affects our understanding of the prevalence of sexual reproduction. It has been investigated in a diverse array of organisms but almost exclusively for deleterious mutations. Interactions between beneficial mutations can impede adaptation, and we therefore investigated epistasis between beneficial mutations by constructing 18 bacteriophage genomes, each with two mutations that had been previously identified as beneficial, and measuring their fitnesses. We found universal evidence for epistasisâ€”every pair of mutations conferred fitness lower than that expected from the single mutations alone. In many cases, a beneficial mutation became deleterious when in combination with another, and in fact, only one pair out of 18 could be shown to confer significantly greater fitness than its constituent mutations alone. To explain these results, we developed a model of the relationship between phenotype and fitness that posits an intermediate phenotypic optimum and assumes no epistasis at the phenotypic level. This model fit our data well and showed that the patterns we observed could result because mutants have phenotypes that overshoot the optimum.
