Our study was conducted between January 2004 and December 2006 on 15 patients with various types of cancer. The criteria for selection included patients with locally-advanced tumor that was rapidly growing and life threatening and those who had poor quality of life and general wellbeing. The patients were already discharged from the cancer centre before joining the study, after they had already received their chemoradiation protocol. Once a week for one month, different areas of the tumor were injected with 0.25 ml of polydimethylsiloxane medical grade (viscosity: 350 centistokes at 30Â°C), mixed with 300,000 units of lyophilized human IL-2. Tumor biopsies were taken before the study was started and one week after the last injection for the histopathological analysis of the percentage of severe inflammatory reaction using an image analysis system. CT scans of the tumor were taken before the injection cycle was started and one week after the last injection in order to determine the percentage change in the size of the tumor. The quality of life and general wellbeing of the patients was assessed at the beginning of the stud, and one week after the study was over by using the Karnofsky performance test.
