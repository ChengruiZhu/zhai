Lectins are proteins that have the ability to recognize and bind in a reversible and specific way to free carbohydrates or glycoconjugates of cell membranes. For these reasons, they have been extensively used in a wide range of industrial and pharmacological applications. Currently, there is great interest in their production on a large scale. Unfortunately, conventional techniques do not provide the appropriate platform for this purpose and therefore, the heterologous production of lectins in different organisms has become the preferred method in many cases. Such systems have the advantage of providing better yields as well as more homogeneous and better-defined properties for the resultant products. However, an inappropriate choice of the expression system can cause important structural alterations that have repercussions on their biological activity since the specificity may lay in their post-translational processing, which depends largely on the producing organism. The present review aims to examine the most representative studies in the area, exposing the four most frequently used systems (bacteria, yeasts, plants and animal cells), with the intention of providing the necessary information to determine the strategy to follow in each case as well as their respective advantages and disadvantages.
