Although it has been suggested that the 8-oxoguanine DNA glycosylase (OGG1) gene Ser326Cys polymorphism may be a risk factor for cancer, the conclusions from previous studies are inconsistent. Thus, we conducted an updated meta-analysis to estimate the effect of OGG1 variant genotypes on cancer susceptibility. We searched the PubMed for all eligible studies published in English for the period ending September 2014. We found the association between OGG1 Ser326Cys polymorphism and cancer susceptibility based on 152 case-control studies in different genetic model comparisons (dominant model: OR = 1.053, P = 0.018; recessive model: OR = 1.108, P < 0.001; homozygote: OR = 1.135, P < 0.001; additive model: OR = 1.059, P < 0.001). However, the results from the subgroup analyses based on types of cancer, health population as controls or studies with relatively large sample size did not support the conclusion. Although the overall results of this meta-analysis showed a positive association between OGG1 variant genotypes and cancer susceptibility, the subgroup analyses by cancer type, sample size, and source of controls presented inconsistent results. Therefore, the current evidence from the meta-analysis did not support the hypothesis of OGG1 Ser326Cys polymorphism as a risk factor of cancer.
