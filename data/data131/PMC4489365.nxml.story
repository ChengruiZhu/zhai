Antibodies are protective proteins used by the immune system to recognize and neutralize foreign objects through interactions with a specific part of the target, called an antigen. Antibody structures are Y-shaped, contain multiple protein chains, and include two antigen-binding sites. The binding sites are located at the end of the Fab fragments, which are the upward facing arms of the Y-structure. The Fab fragments maintain binding affinity by themselves, and are thus often used as surrogates to student antibody-antigen interactions. High affinity antibodies are produced during the course of an immune response by successive mutations to germline gene-encoded antibodies. Germline antibodies are more likely to be polyspecific, whereas the affinity maturation process yields monoclonal antibodies that bind specifically to the target antigen. In this work, we use a computational Distance Constraint Model to characterize how mechanical properties change as three disparate germline antibodies are converted to affinity mature. Our results reveal a rich set of mechanical responses throughout the Fab structure. Nevertheless, increased rigidity in the VH domain is consistently observed, which is consistent with the transition from polyspecificity to monospecificity. That is, flexible antibody structures are able to recognize multiple antigens, while increased affinity and specificity is achieved—in part—by structural rigidification.
