The intricate relationship between structural brain connectivity and functional brain activity is an important and intriguing research area. Brain structure (the pattern of neuroanatomical connections) is thought to strongly influence and constrain brain function (the pattern of neuronal activations). Concurrently, brain function is thought to gradually reshape brain structure, through processes such as activity-dependent plasticity (the “what fires together, wires together” principle). In this study, we examined the relationship between brain structure and function in a biologically realistic mathematical model. More specifically, we considered the relationship between realistic features of brain structure, such as self-similar organization of specialized brain regions at multiple spatial scales (hierarchical modularity) and realistic features of brain activity, such as self-similar complex dynamics poised between order and randomness (self-organized criticality). We found a direct association between these structural and functional features in our model. This association only occurred in the presence of activity-dependent plasticity, and may reflect the importance of the corresponding structural and functional features in neuronal information processing.
