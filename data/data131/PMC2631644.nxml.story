Decisions are commonly based on multiple sources of information. In a forced choice task, for example, sensory information about the identity of a stimulus may be combined with prior information about the amount of reward associated with each choice. We employed a well-characterized motion discrimination task to examine how animals combine such sources of information and whether they weigh these components so as to harvest rewards optimally. Two monkeys discriminated the direction of motion in a family of noisy random dot stimuli. The animals were informed before each trial whether reward outcomes were equal or unequal for the two alternatives, and if unequal, which alternative promised the larger reward. Predictably, choices were biased toward the larger reward in the unequal reward conditions. We develop a decision-making model that describes the animals' sensitivities to the visual stimulus and permits us to calculate the choice bias that yields optimal reward harvesting. We find that the monkeys' performance is close to optimal; remarkably, the animals garner 98%+ of their maximum possible rewards. This study adds to the growing evidence that animal foraging behavior can approach optimality and provides a rigorous theoretical basis for understanding the computations underlying optimality in this and related tasks.
