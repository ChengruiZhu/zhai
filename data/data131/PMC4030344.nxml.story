Basal cell carcinomas (BCC) on the genital area account for less than 1% of all BCCs. Surgical management is indicated. Recurrence rate of vulvar BCC has been reported to be 10-20%. Mohs micrographic surgery (MMS) is a superior surgical option. Other treatments include radiation and topical immuntherapy. Cryosurgery for vulvar BCC has not been reported. We present the case of a 88-year-old Hispanic woman with a vulvar ulcer that was confirmed as BCC by histopathology and treated with liquid nitrogen cryosurgery. Control biopsy was performed on day 90 was negative for BCC. No clinical evidence of recurrence was detected after one year. Although, the vulva is considered to be a high-risk site with respect to BCC and MMS is the gold standard for treatment, the delicate nature of the area may preclude complete removal by a surgical technique without compromising vital anatomical function. Liquid nitrogen cryosurgery uses the effects of extreme cold to effect deep destruction of the tumor and surrounding tissues. This is the first report of a vulvar BCC successfully treated with liquid nitrogen cryosurgery. We suggest this technique could be of benefit as an alternative treatment in cases where excisional procedures cannot be performed.
