The CHO cell mutant FD 1.3.25 exhibits both increased accumulation and altered distribution of endocytosed fluid phase tracers. Neither the rate of tracer internalization nor the kinetics of recycling from early endosomes was affected, but exocytosis from late endocytic compartments appeared to be decreased in the mutant. Endocytosed tracer moved more rapidly to the cell poles in FD1.3.25 than in wild type cells. An abundant 36-kD polypeptide was found associated with taxol-polymerized microtubules in preparations from wild type and mutant; in the former but not the latter this polypeptide could be dissociated by incubation of the microtubules in ATP or high salt. The 36-kD polypeptide co- electrophoresed in two dimensions with the monomer of the glycolytic enzyme glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH). Analysis of cDNA clones showed that the mutant is heterozygous for this enzyme, with approximately 25% of the GAPDH RNA containing a single nucleotide change resulting in substitution of Ser for Pro234, a residue that is conserved throughout evolution. Stable transfectants of wild type cells expressing the mutant monomer at approximately 15% of the total enzyme exhibited the various changes in endocytosis observed in FD1.3.25.
