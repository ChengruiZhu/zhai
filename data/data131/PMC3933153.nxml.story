Tissue Engineering of skeletal muscle tissue still remains a major challenge. Every neo-tissue construct of clinically relevant dimensions is highly dependent on an intrinsic vascularisation overcoming the limitations of diffusion conditioned survival. Approaches incorporating the arteriovenous-loop model might bring further advances to the generation of vascularised skeletal muscle tissue. In this study 12 syngeneic rats received transplantation of carboxy-fluorescine diacetate-succinimidyl ester (CFDA)-labelled, expanded primary myoblasts into a previously vascularised fibrin matrix, containing a microsurgically created AV loop. As control cells were injected into fibrin-matrices without AV-loops. Intra-arterial ink injection followed by explantation was performed 2, 4 and 8 weeks after cell implantation. Specimens were evaluated for CFDA, MyoD and DAPI staining, as well as for mRNA expression of muscle specific genes. Results showed enhanced fibrin resorption in dependence of AV loop presence. Transplanted myoblasts could be detected in the AV loop group even after 8 weeks by CFDA-fluorescence, still showing positive MyoD staining. RT-PCR revealed gene expression of MEF-2 and desmin after 4 weeks on the AV loop side, whereas expression analysis of myogenin and MHC
