 Rabbits may show a high agglutination titer to the hog-cholera bacillus and have no immunity and on the other hand immune animals may have a comparatively low agglutination titer. In other words, with this organism the height of the agglutination titer does not indicate the degree of immunity. As this bacillus so closely resembles the typhoid bacillus biologically and pathologically, it seems safe to conclude, until evidence is brought forth to the contrary, that in man the height of the agglutination titer does not indicate the actual degree of immunity to the latter organism. The same would apply to other members of the typhoid-colon group. It would not be wise to draw a more general conclusion until other organisms have been tested. This does not mean that agglutinins are not related to immunity but it brings up the question of the wisdom of using them as a guide in immunization with the colon-typhoid group. When injected into the normal, vaccinated, or immune rabbit, the virulent hog-cholera bacillus is rapidly clumped and disappears from the circulation. 40 minutes after injection these organisms can be found in phagocytes in the liver. The fact that the normal rabbit gives this
