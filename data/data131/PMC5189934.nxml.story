Antibiotic-resistant bacterial infections are on the rise and pose a serious threat to society. The influence of genetic resistance mechanisms on antibiotic therapy is well described. However, other factors, such as epigenetic resistance or the impact of the environment on antibiotic therapy, are less well understood. Here, we describe and characterize a mechanism of noninherited antibiotic resistance that enables the survival and outgrowth of genetically susceptible bacteria during antibiotic therapy. We show that bacteria expressing the resistance factor chloramphenicol (Cm) acetyltransferase (CAT) can potently deactivate Cm in their immediate environment. The reduced Cm concentration then allows for the outgrowth of genetically susceptible bacteria in the same environment. Mathematical modeling demonstrates the presence of a parameter space in which stable coexistence between Cm-susceptible and -resistant bacteria is possible during antibiotic therapy, which we validated using single-cell analyses. Strikingly, mixed culture experiments in which mice were infected with both Cm-susceptible and -resistant pneumococci revealed that Cm-sensitive “freeloader” bacteria even outcompeted resistant bacteria during antibiotic therapy. Together, we show that the microbial context during infection is a potential complicating factor to antibiotic treatment outcomes.
