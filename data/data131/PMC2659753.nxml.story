Targeted genetic perturbation is a powerful tool for inferring gene function in model organisms. Functional relationships between genes can be inferred by observing the effects of multiple genetic perturbations in a single strain. The study of these relationships, generally referred to as genetic interactions, is a classic technique for ordering genes in pathways, thereby revealing genetic organization and gene-to-gene information flow. Genetic interaction screens are now being carried out in high-throughput experiments involving tens or hundreds of genes. These data sets have the potential to reveal genetic organization on a large scale, and require computational techniques that best reveal this organization. In this paper, we use a complexity metric based in information theory to determine the maximally informative network given a set of genetic interaction data. We find that networks with high complexity scores yield the most biological information in terms of (i) specific associations between genes and biological functions, and (ii) mapping modules of co-functional genes. This information-based approach is an automated, unsupervised classification of the biological rules underlying observed genetic interactions. It might have particular potential in genetic studies in which interactions are complex and prior gene annotation data are sparse.
