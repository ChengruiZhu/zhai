Cardiac myosin is a motor protein responsible for the contraction of the heart muscle. New strategies for the cure of heart diseases are currently being developed by using myosin modulators, which are small molecules that can interact with myosin and modify its activity. The advantage of this approach over traditional drugs is that by directly targeting cardiac myosin it is possible to have drugs with reduced side effects. Moreover, the availability of a spectrum of molecules to finely tune myosin to a desired level of activity opens the possibility to develop more precise and personalised drug therapies. In this work, we study a recently discovered activator of cardiac myosin, omecamtiv mecarbil, in order to understand its mechanism of action. In particular, we use Molecular Dynamics simulations to unravel the effects of the drug on myosin motions, which are closely related to its function. We find that omecamtiv has a strong effect on myosin dynamics and it changes the way regions of the protein that are critical for its function interact with each other. We use these data to identify genetic mutations associated with heart diseases that could be targeted by the drug and to suggest a possible route to design drugs with different therapeutic properties.
