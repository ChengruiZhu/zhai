In this study, we investigated the capacity of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) B cells to undergo terminal differentiation into Ig-secreting plasma cells in T cell-independent and T cell-dependent responses. We used a two-step model involving stimulation with phorbol myristate acetate (PMA) and CD40L, together with cytokines (PMA/c and CD40L/c), for 7 days. We describe immunophenotypic modifications, changes in the levels of mRNA and protein for transcription factors and morphological and functional events occurring during the differentiation of CLL B cells into antibody-secreting cells (ASCs). The induction of differentiation differed significantly between the CD40L/c and PMA/c culture systems. The PMA/c culture system allowed CLL B cells to differentiate into IgM-secreting cells with an immunophenotype and molecular profile resembling those of preplasmablasts. By contrast, CD40L/c-stimulated cells had a phenotype and morphology similar to those of activated B cells and resembling those of the CLL B cells residing in the lymph node and bone marrow. These data suggest that the CLL B cells are not frozen permanently at a stage of differentiation and are able to differentiate into ASCs as appropriate stimulation are provided. The data presented here raise questions about the molecular processes and stimulation required for CLL B-cell differentiation and about the inability of CD40 ligand to induce differentiation of the CLL B cells.
