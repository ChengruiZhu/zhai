We present a case of a 19-year-old female presenting with cyanosis since birth. The major anomaly demonstrated was a “triply twisted heart” with a balanced physiology, allowing her to survive into adulthood. Non-invasive imaging was done using 2D and real-time 3D (or 4D) echocardiography with multi-slice imaging from 4D volume datasets. Findings were confirmed using cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). A segmental approach revealed atrial and visceral situs inversus, levocardia, atrioventricular discordance, and ventriculoarterial discordance. Both the aorta and pulmonary artery were malposed and arise from the right ventricle (double outlet right ventricle or DORV). There was also a complete atrioventricular septal defect (CAVSD) associated with a functional single atrium and a functional univentricle (single ventricle). Other findings include a severe pulmonic stenosis (PS), preserved right and left ventricular systolic function, and a normal pulmonary arterial pressure. She also had a persistent left superior vena cava (SVC) that drains into the morphologic right atrium, while the right-sided SVC drains into the morphologic left atrium. A multidisciplinary team deemed that management be palliative. She is on regular follow-up at our clinics for non-invasive monitoring. To our knowledge, this is the first reported case in an adult with this combination of anomalies.
