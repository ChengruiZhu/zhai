Pb) groups. The following contents were performed: Morphologic observation for 90 days in brain tissues and for 12, 24, 36, and 48 hours in embryonic neurocytes; and antioxidant indexes, messenger RNA (mRNA) expression of twenty-five selenoproteins, and mRNA and protein expression of five apoptosis-related genes for 30, 60, and 90 days in brain tissues and for 12, 24, 36, and 48 hours in embryonic neurocytes. The results indicated that Se alleviated Pb-caused morphological changes; the decrease of superoxide dismutase, glutathione peroxidase (GPx), GPx1, GPx2, GPx3, GPx4, thioredoxin reductases (Txnrd)1, Txnrd2, Txnrd3, iodothyronine deiodinases (Dio)1, Dio2, Dio3, selenoprotein (Sel)T, SelK, SelS, SelH, SelM, SelU, SelI, SelO, Selpb, selenoprotein (Sep)n1, Sepp1, Sepx1, Sepw1, 15-kDa selenoprotein, and selenophosphate synthetases 2, and B-cell lymphoma-2 (Bcl-2); the increase of malondialdehyde, p53, Bcl-2 associated X protein, cytochrome c, and Caspase-3. Pb had time-dependent effects on GPx4, SelM, and malondialdehyde in the brain tissues; and on SelU in the embryonic neurocytes. Our data demonstrated that Se alleviated Pb-induced apoptosis in the chicken nervous tissues via mitochondrial pathway.
