In 2011, a total of 14,028,774 laboratory test order or result reports from 821,108 individual patients were reported from the 63 hospitals in 14 states. Since, by design the BioSense Program monitors a select set of syndromes mainly representing infectious conditions, 94% of the total reports were microbiology test orders or results. Seventy-seven percent of all test orders (n = 10,776,494) used LOINC codes. Of all test results with at least one value either in observation identifier (OBX3) or observation value (OBX5) segments of their Health Level 7 (HL7) ELR message (n = 12,313,952), 81% had only LOINC codes, 0.1% had only SNOMED codes, 7% had both LOINC and SNOMED codes, and 12% used no codes. In total, 1,428 unique LOINC and 608 unique SNOMED codes were used to describe the results, and 805 unique LOINC codes were used to describe the orders. Of the 608 unique SNOMED codes, 111 (18.3%) did not have corresponding LOINC codes. Fifty-one (46%) of these 111 SNOMED codes could have been matched to corresponding LOINC codes based on the concept. However, our search for matching LOINC codes in Relma for certain SNOMED concepts indicated that LOINC does not have codes for select types of laboratory test results, particularly qualifier (such as reactive, negative, and resistant) or structural (labia, urethra, and vagina) concepts.
