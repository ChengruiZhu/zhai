Psoriasis (PS) and psoriatic arthritis (PSA) are common inflammatory diseases of humans affecting the skin and joints. Approximately 2% of Europeans are affected with PS, and ∼10–30% of patients develop PSA. Genetic variation in the MHC (multiple histocompatibility locus antigen cluster) increases risk of developing PS. However, only ∼10% of individuals with this risk factor develop PS, indicating that other genetic effects and environmental triggers are important. Recent approaches using a case/control approach and genome wide association studies with DNA markers known as SNPs (single nucleotide polymorphisms) have been fruitful in identifying genetic factors for common diseases. This study describes the first large scale genome wide scan for additional PS and PSA susceptibility genes using 233 cases and 519 controls. It revealed that the MHC is truly the most important risk factor for PS and that it plays a very major role in PSA, confirmed recently identified associations with interleukin 23 receptor and interleukin 12B in both PS and PSA, and identified new associations. These include a region on chromosome 4q27 that contains genes for interleukin 2 and interleukin 21 that has been recently implicated in other autoimmune diseases, and seven additional regions that include chromosome 13q13 and 15q21.
