Interleukin 12 (IL-12) doses in excess of 100 ng/d have been shown to induce profound immunotoxicities in mice infected with lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV). These immunotoxicities are characterized by almost complete inhibition of virus-induced CD8+ T cell expansion and CTL activation, and up to 2 log increases in viral replication. They are accompanied by induction of serum tumor necrosis factor (TNF). The studies presented here were undertaken to characterize mechanisms for the IL-12-induced toxicities and to examine expression and function of TNF in this context. Several physiological changes were induced in IL-12-treated uninfected and dramatically elevated in IL-12-treated virus-infected mice. IL-12 induced (a) decreases in body weights, > 10% in uninfected and > 20% in LCMV-infected mice; (b) elevation of circulating glucocorticoid levels to > 10 micrograms/dl in uninfected and > 20 micrograms/dl in infected mice; and (c) decreases in thymic mass, > 30% in uninfected and up to 95% in infected mice. These changes are known to be associated with circulating TNF. Northern blot and in situ hybridization analyses demonstrated that IL-12 induced TNF-alpha expression and that LCMV infection synergized with IL-12 for induction of this factor. Antibodies neutralizing TNF reversed all of the IL-12- induced toxicities in LCMV-infected mice including the immunotoxicities against CD8+ T cells and anti-viral defenses. The TNF-mediated immunotoxicities appeared to result from an induced cellular sensitivity to the factor, as splenic leukocytes and CD8+ T cell subsets isolated from LCMV-infected mice were more sensitive to TNF- mediated cytotoxicity in culture than were equivalent populations prepared from uninfected mice. Experiments with the glucocorticoid type II receptor antagonist, RU486, demonstrated that endogenous glucocorticoids were secondary intermediaries in IL-12-induced thymic atrophy. Studies in IL-2-deficient mice showed that the synergism was dependent upon endogenous IL-2. The results delineate a unique mechanism of TNF-mediated toxicity. In addition, they have significant implications concerning potential detrimental consequences of in vivo TNF induction and of IL-12 administration for protective anti-viral responses.
