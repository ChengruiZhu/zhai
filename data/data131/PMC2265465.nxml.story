Information processing by the brain relies crucially on neuronal circuits. Therefore, clarifying the structure of the brain circuitry is a crucial step towards understanding how the brain processes information. In particular, the cerebral cortex occupies a large portion of the brain in primates and humans, so the organization of local cortical networks is essential for the emergence of higher cognitive functions. However, the complex structure and computations of local cortical networks remain largely unknown. In this study, we investigate the neuronal wiring and activity self-organizing with synaptic plasticity in a model of local cortical networks. Synaptic plasticity describes how synapses between neuron pairs are modified according to activities of the individual pairs. The irregular activity self-organizing in our model surprisingly resembles the spontaneous cortical activity observed during sleep. Moreover, such an autonomous activity contains a diverse repertoire of precisely timed temporal sequences. Whether local cortical networks produce such precise temporal sequences is currently debated in neuroscience. The self-organization of temporal sequences in the sleep-like state suggests that they may play an active role in learning sensory experiences and motor skills, for which sleep is known to be crucial.
