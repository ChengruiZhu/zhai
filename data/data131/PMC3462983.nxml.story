-geranyltransferase leads later to biosynthesis of shikonins. The addition of 0.01 or 0.1 mM PHE to the culture medium stimulated cell proliferation, where the highest observed increase in fresh cell biomass (measured as a ratio of final weight to initial weight) was 12-fold, in contrast to an eightfold increase in control cultures. Whereas, growth media supplemented with 1 mM PHE markedly reduced the rate of cell growth (to only twofold). Precursor feeding had detrimental effects on both ACS and IBS production in all PHE-supplemented media. The highest total content (intracellular + extracellular) of the investigated red pigments (9.5 mg per flask) was detected in the control culture without PHE. ACS was the major component of the naphthoquinone fraction determined in cells and post-culture media. Shikonin itself was found only in the post-culture media from cultures supplemented with 0.01 or 0.1 mM PHE. Increases in PAL activity corresponded well with the accumulation of investigated naphthoquinones in control culture. However, peak PAL activity did not directly correlate with maximum production of shikonin derivatives. Cytotoxicity of extracts, prepared from the cells cultivated in the presence of PHE or in control cultures, was tested on three cancer cell lines: HL-60, HeLa, and MCF-7. The extracts prepared from the untreated control cultures proved to be the most potent against the examined cancer cell lines. The mean inhibitory concentration values were 0.3, 13, and 8 μg ml
