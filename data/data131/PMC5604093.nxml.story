Osteochondral defects of the femoral head are rare. Several treatment options have been described, though there is currently no consensus on the appropriate management of these lesions. Five patients underwent femoral head osteochondral autograft transfer for treatment of ipsilateral femoral head osteochondral defects via surgical hip dislocation between 2011 and 2014 at our institution. The mean age of the patients was 24.8 (16–37) years. There were four females and one male. Mean follow-up was 53.8 (30–64) months. Four patients reported complete resolution of preoperative pain, return to baseline activities and were satisfied with their results. Harris hip scores improved from a mean 60.8 (30–87) to 86.6 (44–100). There was no radiographic evidence of progression of the femoral head defects. There were no operative complications. Osteochondral autograft transfer from the ipsilateral femoral head using a surgical hip dislocation demonstrated good clinical and radiographic outcomes at midterm follow-up in our cohort and may be considered a suitable option for management of these lesions in select patients. Further research and follow-up is warranted to more clearly define the indications and outcomes of this procedure.
