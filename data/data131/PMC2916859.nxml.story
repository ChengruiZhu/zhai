p53-response elements (p53-REs) are 20 base pairs (bps) DNA segments recognized by the p53 transcription factor (TF). They are found in promoters and enhancers across the genome and are associated with genes that have diverse functions. Because the DNA sequences of p53-REs can be very similar to each other, differing by as little as one or two bps, it is challenging to understand how p53 distinguishes between these to activate a specific function. Here we show that even a slight RE sequence change can be sufficient to elicit allosteric structural and dynamic perturbations in the p53 which propagate to other binding sites, and as such are expected to affect co-regulator recruitment. Among the major interactions between p53 and its REs involving Lys120, Arg280, and Arg248, the Lys120 interaction partners vary less than interactions between other residues. The outcome of our simulations of six p53-RE complexes shows that the variance of the interaction patterns triggers changes in the organization of tetrameric p53 and of residues away from the interaction sites. Subsequent events can depend on the level and post-translational states of co-regulators that are able to bind the unique p53 surface caused by the specific p53-RE binding.
