The complete primary structure of the human oligodendrocyte-myelin glycoprotein (OMgp), a glycophospholipid-linked membrane protein of oligodendrocytes and central nervous system myelin, has been determined. The deduced amino acid sequence predicts a polypeptide of 433 amino acids which includes a 17-amino acid leader sequence. OMgp consists of four domains: (a) a short cysteine-rich motif at the NH2 terminus; (b) a series of tandem leucine-rich repeats (LRs) present in several other proteins where they may play roles in adhesion; (c) a serine/threonine-rich region that contains probable attachment sites for O-linked carbohydrates; and (d) a hydrophobic COOH-terminal segment that is likely to be cleaved concomitant with the attachment of lipid during biosynthesis of OMgp. OMgp shares the first three of its four domains with the platelet glycoprotein Ib, which is responsible for the initial adhesion of platelets to the exposed subendothelium during hemostasis. Together with glycoprotein Ib and several other proteins, OMgp belongs to a family of proteins that contain both an NH2-terminal cysteine-rich motif and an adjacent series of LRs. In addition, we report that a subpopulation of OMgp molecules contains the HNK-1 carbohydrate, which has been shown to mediate interactions among cells in the central nervous system.
