The major cause of mortality in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) is atherosclerosis related to traditional and non-traditional risk factors. However, the understanding of the molecular specificity that distinguishes the risk factors for classical cardiovascular disease (CVD) and CKD-related atherosclerosis (CKD-A) is far from complete. In this study we investigated the disease-related differences in the proteomes of patients with atherosclerosis related and non-related to CKD. Plasma collected from patients in various stages of CKD, CVD patients without symptoms of kidney dysfunction, and healthy volunteers (HVs), were analyzed by a coupled label-free and mass spectrometry approach. Dysregulated proteins were confirmed by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). All proteomic data were correlated with kidney disease development and were subjected to bioinformatics analysis. One hundred sixty-two differentially expressed proteins were identified. By directly comparing the plasma proteomes from HVs, CKD, and CVD patients in one study, we demonstrated that proteins involved in inflammation, blood coagulation, oxidative stress, vascular damage, and calcification process exhibited greater alterations in patients with atherosclerosis related with CKD. These data indicate that the above nontraditional risk factors are strongly specific for CKD-A and appear to be less essential for the development of “classical” CVD.
