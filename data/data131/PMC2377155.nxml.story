Cellular systems comprise many diverse components and component interactions spanning signal transduction, transcriptional regulation, and metabolism. Although signaling, metabolic, and regulatory activities are often investigated independently of one another, there is growing evidence that considerable interplay occurs among them, and that the malfunctioning of this interplay is associated with disease. The computational analysis of integrated networks has been challenging because of the varying time scales involved as well as the sheer magnitude of such systems (e.g., the numbers of rate constants involved). To this end, we developed a novel computational framework called integrated dynamic flux balance analysis (idFBA) that generates quantitative, dynamic predictions of species concentrations spanning signaling, regulatory, and metabolic processes. idFBA extends an existing approach called flux balance analysis (FBA) in that it couples “fast” and “slow” reactions, thereby facilitating the study of whole-cell phenotypes and not just sub-cellular network properties. We applied this framework to a prototypic integrated system derived from literature as well as a representative integrated yeast module (the high-osmolarity glycerol [HOG] pathway) and generated time-course predictions that matched with available experimental data. By extending this framework to larger-scale systems, phenotypic profiles of whole-cell systems could be attained expeditiously.
