Annotating repetitive regions of genomes experimentally is a challenging task. Chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by high-throughput sequencing (ChIP-seq) provides valuable data for characterizing repetitive regions of genomes in terms of transcription factor binding. Although ChIP-seq technology has been maturing, available ChIP-seq analysis methods and software rely on discarding sequence reads that map to multiple locations on the reference genome (multi-reads), thereby generating a missed opportunity for assessing transcription factor binding to highly repetitive regions of genomes. We develop a computational algorithm that takes multi-reads into account in ChIP-seq analysis. We show with computational experiments that multi-reads lead to significant increase in sequencing depths and identification of binding regions that are otherwise not identifiable when only reads that uniquely map to the reference genome (uni-reads) are used. In particular, we show that the number of binding regions identified can increase up to 36%. We support our computational predictions with independent quantitative real-time ChIP validation of binding regions identified only when multi-reads are incorporated in the analysis of a mouse GATA1 ChIP-seq experiment.
