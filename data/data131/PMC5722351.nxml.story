This paper proposes a novel approach to initial lesion detection in ultrasound breast images. The objective is to automate the manual process of region of interest (ROI) labeling in computer‐aided diagnosis (CAD). We propose the use of hybrid filtering, multifractal processing, and thresholding segmentation in initial lesion detection and automated ROI labeling. We used 360 ultrasound breast images to evaluate the performance of the proposed approach. Images were preprocessed using histogram equalization before hybrid filtering and multifractal analysis were conducted. Subsequently, thresholding segmentation was applied on the image. Finally, the initial lesions are detected using a rule‐based approach. The accuracy of the automated ROI labeling was measured as an overlap of 0.4 with the lesion outline as compared with lesions labeled by an expert radiologist. We compared the performance of the proposed method with that of three state‐of‐the‐art methods, namely, the radial gradient index filtering technique, the local mean technique, and the fractal dimension technique. We conclude that the proposed method is more accurate and performs more effectively than do the benchmark algorithms considered.
