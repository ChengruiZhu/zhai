Gene expression signatures have historically been used to generate molecular fingerprints that characterise distinct tissues. Moreover, by interrogating these molecular signatures it has been possible to understand how a tissueâ€™s function is regulated at the molecular level. However, even between cells from a seemingly homogeneous tissue sample, there exists substantial heterogeneity in gene expression levels. These differences might correspond to novel subtypes or to transient states linked, for example, to the cell cycle. Single-cell RNA-sequencing, where the transcriptomes of individual cells are profiled using next generation sequencing, provides a method for identifying genes that show more variation across cells than expected by chance, which might be characteristic of such populations. However, single-cell RNA-sequencing is subject to a high degree of technical noise, making it necessary to account for this to robustly identify such genes. To this end, we use a fully Bayesian approach that jointly models extrinsic spike-in molecules with genes from the cells of interest allowing better identification of such genes than previously described computational strategies. We validate our approach using data from mouse Embryonic Stem Cells.
