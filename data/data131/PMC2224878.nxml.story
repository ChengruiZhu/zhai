 Sprague-Dawley rats subjected 2 months previously to partial resection (10 per cent) of the small intestine and their controls were injected with tritiated thymidine and sacrificed at 2 and 23 hours. Segments of the duodenum, jejunum, and ileum were autoradiographed, and the migration of the labelled cells during the period between 2 and 23 hours was measured with an eyepiece micrometer. The cells had migrated 35, 42, and 34 per cent of the total distance from the crypts to the tips of the villi in the control segments of duodenum, ileum, and jejunum respectively, and 43, 90, and 82 per cent, respectively, in similar segments from resected animals. The rate of migration in the portion of the intestine remaining after resection was approximately three times the normal rate in the ileum, twice the normal rate in the jejunum, and showed an increase of one-third in the duodenum. These results demonstrate that the rate of cell renewal is considerably greater in the remaining portion of the intestine of resected animals than in normal intestine. The increased rate of migration after resection, together with the increase in the height of the villi, resulted in an increase in the rate of cell renewal amounting to 141 per cent in the ileum, 114 per cent in the jejunum, and 23 per cent in the duodenum when compared with control segments.
