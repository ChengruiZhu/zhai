 In guinea pig testes perfused with either glutaraldehyde or osmium tetroxide fixative, the cytoplasm of the interstitial cells contains an exceptionally abundant agranular endoplasmic reticulum. The reticulum in central regions of the cell is a network of interconnected tubules, but in extensive peripheral areas the reticulum is commonly organized into closely packed, flattened cisternae which are fenestrated. Occasional small patches of the granular reticulum occur in the cytoplasm and connect freely with the agranular reticulum. The mitochondria have a dense matrix and contain cristae and some tubules. The Golgi complex is disperse and shows no evidence of secretory material. The cytoplasm also contains lipid droplets. Lipofuscin pigment granules are probably polymorphic residual bodies and contain three components: (1) a dense material which at high magnification shows a 75-A periodicity; (2) a medium-sized lipid droplet; and (3) a cap-like structure. In glutaraldehyde-perfused testis the interstitial cell cytoplasm appears to have the same density from cell to cell, and the agranular reticulum is tubular or cisternal but not in the form of empty vesicles. Thus the "dark" and "light" cells and the vesicular agranular reticulum sometimes encountered in other fixations may be artifacts. Biochemical results from other laboratories, correlated with the present findings, indicate that the membranes of the agranular endoplasmic reticulum in guinea pig interstitial cells are the site of at least two enzymes of androgen biosynthesis, the 17-hydroxylase and the 17-desmolase.
