In assisted reproductive techniques, the operator attempts to select morphologically best embryos to predict embryo viability. Development of polarized light microscope, which evaluates the oocytes' spindles according to birefringence of living cells, had been helpful in oocyte selection. The aim of this study is evaluating the relationship between meiotic spindles visualization and intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) outcomes in human oocytes. In this study, 264 oocytes from 24 patients with an average age of 30.5Â±7.5 years with infertility duration of 1 to 10 years were collected. The oocytes were randomly allocated to the control injection group (n=126) and the oocyte imaging group (spindle-aligned group) (n=138). In the spindle-aligned group, the meiotic spindle was identified by means of polarized light microscope to align the spindle at 6 or 12 o'clock. Then the spindle-aligned group was divided into three sub-groups based on spindle morphology: fine, average, and (poor). After ICSI, embryos were checked every 24 hours and scored; 72 hours later, high-grade embryos were transferred intravaginally to uterus. This study showed that the fertilization rate in the spindle-aligned group was higher than the control group (
