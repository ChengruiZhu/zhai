To evaluate the early postoperative change in astigmatism in pediatric patients having cataract extraction with intraocular lens implantation using sutured temporal clear corneal incision. Methods: A retrospective chart review was performed on all pediatric patients who underwent clear corneal cataract surgery with intraocular lens implantation between 12/01/2005 and 11/30/2006. Results: A total of 31 eyes of 22 patients who underwent temporal clear corneal cataract surgery and intraocular lens implantation were included. The mean patient age at surgery was 6.05 years (range 1.5 months to 17 years). Mean postoperative refractive astigmatism the first day after surgery was 2.35±1.37 diopters (D). There was a statistically significant decrease in mean postoperative astigmatism by postoperative week 1 to 1.45 ± 0.79 D. Mean astigmatism was 1.48 ± 0.98 D by postoperative months 2-4, which was not a statistically significant change from postoperative day 1. Conclusions: Postoperative astigmatism can be expected after sutured temporal clear corneal surgery in pediatric patients and decreases over time without removal of sutures. The amount of postoperative astigmatism in children requires close follow-up after pediatric cataract surgery.
