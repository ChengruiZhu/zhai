We present the case of a 65-year-old female who presented to our hospital with nodular swelling in her breast that first appeared in the right upper quadrant 10 months earlier, followed by involvement of the left upper quadrant along with nodular swelling in the right inguinal region for the past six months. She was also complaining of breathlessness on exertion and right-sided pleuritic chest pain for the past one year. Her chest X-ray showed well defined consolidation in the right lower lobe of the lung with pleural effusion. Further pleural tap showed malignant cells with squamous differentiation. Fine needle aspiration cytology (FNAC) from breast lumps was suggestive of malignant cells with morphology of cells likely to be squamous. CT-guided biopsy of the lung mass showed moderately differentiated squamous cell carcinoma of the lung. She succumbed to her illness following severe respiratory distress. Breast lump secondary to lung malignancy is very rare. Squamous cell carcinoma presenting as breast metastasis is a very rare presentation and reported in few cases. No previous case reporting bilateral breast lumps as a presentation of squamous cell carcinoma of the lung could be found in the literature.
