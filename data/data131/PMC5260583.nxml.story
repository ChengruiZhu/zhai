Adrenomedullin (ADM), the product of the vascular endothelial and smooth muscle cells, and cardiomyocytes, is considered to be a local factor controlling vascular tone, cardiac contractility and renal sodium excretion. The aim of this article was to review the existing data on the effect of different types of exercise on plasma ADM concentration in healthy men. The results of studies on the effect of dynamic exercise on the plasma ADM are contradictory. Some authors reported an increase in plasma ADM, while others showed a slight decrease or did not observe any changes. The inverse relationship between plasma ADM and mean blood pressure observed during maximal exercise support the concept that ADM might blunt the exercise-induced systemic blood pressure increase. Positive relationships between increases in plasma ADM and those in noradrenaline, atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) or interleukin-6 observed during prolonged exercise suggest that the sympathetic nervous system and cytokine induction may be involved in ADM release. Increased secretion of ADM and ANP during this type of exercise may be a compensatory mechanism attenuating elevation of blood pressure and preventing deterioration of cardiac function. Studies performed during static exercise have showed an increase in plasma ADM only in older healthy men. Positive correlations between increases in plasma ADM and those in noradrenaline and endothelin-1 may indicate the interaction of these hormones in shaping the cardiovascular response to static exercise. Inverse relationships between exercise-induced changes in plasma ADM and those in cardiovascular indices may be at least partly associated with inotropic action of ADM on the heart. Interactions of ADM with vasoactive peptides, catecholamines and hemodynamic factors demonstrate the potential involvement of this peptide in the regulation of blood pressure and myocardial contractility during exercise.
