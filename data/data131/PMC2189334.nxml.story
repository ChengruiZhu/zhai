In the present study, follicular dendritic cells (FDCs) were purified to homogeneity in order to define the lineage and function of these cells. FDCs were identified by their characteristic morphology and by their expression of receptors for the third complement component, the myeloid-restricted antigen CD14, and the FDC antigen DRC-1. Unclustered FDCs displayed a unique antigenic phenotype since they expressed several B- and myeloid lineage-restricted antigens, but lacked T and NK cell antigens as well as the leukocyte common antigen. FDCs expressed adhesion molecules, including most of the VLA proteins, intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM-1), and CD11b. FDCs could be isolated to homogeneity by their intense staining with anti-CD14 using flow cytometric cell sorting. These highly purified FDCs expressed CD14 and CD21 but lacked CD20. This antigen pattern and characteristic morphology confirmed that these cells were, in fact, homogeneous FDC preparations. Analysis of polymerase chain reaction-amplified cDNA from highly purified FDCs showed no transcripts for IL-6. The isolation of homogeneous FDC populations will be important for the analysis of the functional role of FDCs within the lymphoid follicle.
