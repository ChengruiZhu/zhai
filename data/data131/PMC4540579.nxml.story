Infection with the influenza virus is responsible for serious morbidity and mortality. In otherwise-healthy individuals, infection is usually acute, lasting between 5 to 10 days. Over this time, the virus initially replicates rapidly, before peaking and then being cleared from the body. Despite extensive study, we do not yet fully understand the processes which lead to viral control and viral clearance from the host. Experimental and modelling studies of single infections have previously indicated that both the innate and adaptive immune responses play an important role in combating infection. Here we study a novel dataset on how the host responds to sequential exposure to two different strains of influenza. We introduce a family of mathematical models of the within-host dynamics of influenza infection which allow for re-infection. Our models allow us, for the first time, to differentiate between alternative hypothesised mechanisms by which the innate immune response acts to control viral replication. This study improves our understanding of the innate immune response to influenza and demonstrates that re-exposure studies provide a new paradigm for further experimental research. Our findings may contribute to the development of next-generation treatment and vaccination strategies which rely upon an understanding of the hostâ€™s immunological response to influenza infection.
