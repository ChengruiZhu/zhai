Despite advances in the treatment of multiple myeloma, it remains an incurable disease, with relapses and resistances frequently observed. Recently, immunotherapies, in particular, monoclonal antibodies, have become important treatment options in anticancer therapies. Elotuzumab is a humanized monoclonal antibody to signaling lymphocytic activation molecule F7, which is highly expressed on myeloma cells and, to a lower extent, on selected leukocyte subsets such as natural killer cells. By directly activating natural killer cells and by antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity, elotuzumab exhibits a dual mechanism of action leading to myeloma cell death with minimal effects on normal tissue. In several nonclinical models of multiple myeloma, elotuzumab was effective as a single agent and in combination with standard myeloma treatments, supporting the use of elotuzumab in patients. In combination with lenalidomide and dexamethasone, elotuzumab showed a significant increase in tumor response rates and progression-free survival in patients with relapsed and/or refractory multiple myeloma. This review summarizes the nonclinical and clinical development of elotuzumab as a single agent and in combination with established therapies for the treatment of multiple myeloma.
