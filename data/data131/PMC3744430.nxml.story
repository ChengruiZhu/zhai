Rapid advances in sequencing technology mean that it is now possible to directly assay rare genetic variation. In addition, the availability of almost fully sequenced human genomes by the 1000 Genomes Project allows genotyping at rare variants that are not present on arrays commonly used in genome-wide association studies. Rare variants within a gene or region may act to collectively influence a complex trait. Methods for testing these rare variants should be able to account for a combination of those that serve to either increase, decrease or have no effect on the trait of interest. Here, we introduce a method for the analysis of a collection of rare genetic variants, within a gene or region, which assesses evidence for a mixture of effects. Our method simply aggregates summary statistics at each variant and, as such, can be applied to both population and family-based data, to binary or quantitative traits and to either directly genotyped or imputed data. In addition, it does not require individual level genotype or phenotype data, and can be adjusted for non-genetic risk factors. We illustrate our approach by examining imputed rare variants in the major histocompatibility complex for association with type-1 diabetes using genotype data from the Wellcome Trust case Control Consortium.
