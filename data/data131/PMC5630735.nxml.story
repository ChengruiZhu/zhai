We identified a total of 33 patients meeting our inclusion criteria. Most common sources were SST in 9 cases (27%), bone and joint in 9 (27%), followed by stool -5/33 (15%), blood -4 (12%), sinus 4 (12%) and disseminated (blood and bone marrow) in 1 case and brain tissue in 1 case. The predominant isolates were Mycobacterium (M.) chelonae- 6/33 (18%), M. avium complex- 5/33 (15%), M. abscessus - 5/33 (15%). None of the stool and sinus isolates were considered pathogenic and treated. Most common presentation was fever 7/33 (21%) and skin rash 7/33 (21%). Only 13/33 (39%) patients received specific treatment for the NTM (SST infection 5/9, bone and joint 3/9, blood 3/4, disseminated 1/1, brain tissue 1/1). Of the 13 treated infections, 9 (70%)were foreign body associated; the hardware was removed in all cases except 2 (1 blood isolate associated with prosthetic valve endocarditis and 1 brain tissue). Susceptibilities were available for 19 isolates. All M. abscessus were resistant to at least 4 drugs but none were resistant to amikacin. For the rapid growers, no standard starting treatment was identified. No pattern of laboratory abnormalities (WBC, hemoglobin, AST, alk phos, ESR, CRP) could be identified.
