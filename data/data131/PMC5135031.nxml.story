Scientific validity of research findings depends on scientific rigor, including measures to avoid bias, such as random allocation of animals to treatment groups (randomization) and assessing outcome measures without knowing to which treatment groups the animals belong (blinding). However, measures against bias are rarely reported in publications, and systematic reviews found that poor reporting was associated with larger treatment effects, suggesting bias. Here we studied whether risk of bias could be predicted from study protocols submitted for ethical review. We assessed mention of seven basic measures against bias in study protocols submitted for approval in Switzerland and in publications resulting from these studies. Measures against bias were mentioned at very low rates both in study protocols (2%–19%) and in publications (0%–34%). However, we found a weak positive correlation, indicating that the rates at which measures against bias were mentioned in study protocols predicted the rates at which they were reported in publications. Our results indicate that animal experiments are often licensed based on confidence rather than evidence of scientific rigor, which may compromise scientific validity and induce unnecessary harm to animals caused by inconclusive research.
