A striking feature of most of the crucial intra-cellular organelles, such as Endoplasmic Reticulum (ER), Golgi Complex and mitochondria is a peculiar and strongly curved shape of their membranes. Membranes resist elastically to bending and remodeling. Hence, special proteins must generate forces needed to create and maintain the intracellular membrane curvature and architecture. An effective mechanism by which proteins bend membranes is the scaffolding mechanism based on attachment to the outer membrane surface of hydrophilic protein domains referred to as a protein scaffolds. The scaffolds are intrinsically bent and mold, therefore, the membranes into curved shapes. This action of the scaffolds requires their concentration on the membrane surface due to inter-scaffold attractive forces originating from membrane deformations. Here we analyze quantitatively the membrane-mediated interaction between two strongly anisotropic and intrinsically curved membrane scaffolds, which mimic realistic proteins. We demonstrate that the scaffold shape anisotropy causes a mutual aligning of the scaffolds and generates a strong attractive interaction bringing the scaffolds close to each other to equilibrium distances much smaller than the scaffold size. We compute the energy of interaction between scaffolds of a realistic geometry to constitute tens of
