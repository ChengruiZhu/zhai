Insulin is a central player in maintaining energy balance in our bodies and in type 2 diabetes, where the effect of insulin on its target tissues is diminished. Insulin acts on cells by binding to specific insulin receptors (IRs) at the cell surface. This triggers a series of events, including attachment of phosphate to IR, activation of downstream proteins that eventually mediate the signal to specific targets in the cell, and internalization of IR to the inner cytosolic part of the cell. The importance, time relations, and interactions between these events are not fully understood. We have collected experimental time-series and developed a novel analysis method based on mathematical modeling to gain insights into these initial aspects of how insulin controls cells. The main conclusion is that either IR internalization and the subsequent recycling back to the cell surface or feedbacks from downstream proteins (or both) must be significantly active during the first few minutes of insulin action. These conclusions could not have been reached from the experimental data through conventional biological reasoning, and this work thus illustrates the power of modeling to improve our understanding of biological systems.
