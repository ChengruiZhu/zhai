Competition lies at the core of evolutionary theory and is thought to be one of the dominant processes that explain the ecological and phenotypic diversity of contemporary species. However, the extent to which competition has driven diversification at the macroevolutionary scale of large continental radiations is largely unknown. We address this question by applying a new suite of phylogenetic tools to a dataset that encompasses resource-use and social signaling traits for nearly all species of tanagersâ€”one of the largest avian families, which contains approximately 10% of all songbirds. Using this uniquely comprehensive framework, we show that exploitative competition among lineages drives phenotypic diversification in resource-use traits (beak morphology and locomotory traits) but that the evidence that competition impacts diversification is much weaker in social signaling traits (plumage and song). Furthermore, we show that signaling traits evolve more rapidly than resource-use traits, a finding consistent with the view that traits involved in social interactions diversify during the allopatric phase of speciation, thereby reducing interspecific social competition upon secondary contact. Whereas previous research in several iconic island clades has documented the key role of competition in adaptive radiations, our research provides robust empirical evidence that interspecific competition can also structure ecological trait evolution in radiations that occur on continental scales.
