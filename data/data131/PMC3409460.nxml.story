The effectiveness of navigation systems in performing accurate orthopaedic surgery has been reported previously, but there have been no reports on the application of navigation in surgeries involving bone resection around the elbow joint. In this study, anatomical plasty or bone resection was performed to restore anatomical morphology in 10 cases of osteoarthritis of the elbow and deformity of the distal end of the humerus. Bone resection was performed on the distal end of the humerus using navigation and on the proximal end of the ulna via freehand surgery. Postoperatively, the elbow function was evaluated and pre- and postoperative CT images were used to measure the bone resection. There were no complications arising from the use of navigation, and elbow function was improved in all cases. By evaluating the CT images, it was found that navigated resection of the fossae of the distal humerus was more effective than freehand resection of the processes of the proximal ulna, thus confirming the usefulness of navigation. In future, to fully confirm this finding, it will be necessary to conduct prospective controlled studies of cases in which navigation is used to perform arthroplasty, including those that involve the proximal end of the ulna.
