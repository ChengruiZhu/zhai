 When rat kidney slices were incubated in the presence of horseradish peroxidase, there was an energy-dependent uptake of the protein by the cells of the kidney tubules. The uptake was greatest in the proximal convoluted tubules and in the thick ascending limbs of the loops of Henle; it was abolished by cold, anoxia, 2,4-dinitrophenol, and fluoroacetate, and was more readily depressed by unfavorable metabolic conditions in the proximal convoluted tubules than in the thick ascending limbs. Protein uptake was inhibited when the kidney slices were incubated in electrolyte-free media. In sodium chloride solutions, uptake was reduced as sodium was progressively replaced by choline, and ouabain inhibited uptake in the proximal convoluted tubules, but not in the thick ascending limbs. To a limited extent, lithium could replace sodium in the incubation medium with no depression of peroxidase uptake. These results suggest that a sodium-stimulated, ouabain-sensitive ATPase may be involved in the uptake of protein by cells of the kidney tubule. The intracellular transport of peroxidase in cells of the proximal convoluted tubules was abolished by cold, anoxia, and 2,4-dinitrophenol, but it was not affected by concentrations of ouabain which inhibited the uptake of the protein.
