Varian introduced (in 2010) the option of removing the flattening filter (FF) in their C‐Arm linacs for intensity‐modulated treatments. This mode, called flattening filter‐free (FFF), offers the advantage of a greater dose rate. Varian's “Portal Dosimetry” is an electronic portal imager device (EPID)‐based tool for IMRT verification. This tool lacks the capability of verifying flattening filter‐free (FFF) modes due to saturation and lack of an image prediction algorithm. (Note: the latest versions of this software and EPID correct these issues.) The objective of the present study is to research the feasibility of said verifications (with the older versions of the software and EPID). By placing the EPID at a greater distance, the images can be acquired without saturation, yielding a linearity similar to the flattened mode. For the image prediction, a method was optimized based on the clinically used algorithm (analytical anisotropic algorithm (AAA)) over a homogeneous phantom. The depth inside the phantom and its electronic density were tailored. An application was developed to allow the conversion of a dose plane (in DICOM format) to Varian's custom format for Portal Dosimetry. The proposed method was used for the verification of test and clinical fields for the three qualities used in our institution for IMRT: 6X, 6FFF and 10FFF. The method developed yielded a positive verification (more than 95% of the points pass a
