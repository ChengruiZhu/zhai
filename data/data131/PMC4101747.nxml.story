Data on stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) for four or more metastases are limited. Existing studies are confounded by significant proportions of patients receiving prior whole-brain radiation therapy (WBRT) or concurrent WBRT with SRS. Furthermore, published results disagree about the impact of tumor volume on overall survival. A retrospective review identified 38 patients without prior intracranial radiation or surgery who received Gamma Knife (GK) as sole treatment to ≥4 brain metastases in a single session. Twenty-eight cases with follow-up imaging were analyzed for intracranial progression. Prognostic factors were examined by univariate (log-rank test) and multivariate (Cox proportional hazards model) analyses. Common primary tumors were non-small cell lung (45%), melanoma (37%), and breast (8%). Cases were recursive partitioning analysis class II (94%) or III (6%). Patients harbored a median five tumors (range 4–12) with median total tumor volume of 1.2 cc. A median dose of 21 Gy was prescribed to the 50% isodose line. Patients survived a median 6.7 months from GK. Local treatment failure occurred in one case (4%) and distant failure in 22 (79%). On multivariate analysis, total tumor volume ≥3 cc was significantly associated with distant failure and worsened overall survival (
