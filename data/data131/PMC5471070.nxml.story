Sjögren's syndrome (SS) is a chronic inflammatory autoimmune disease that can occur as a unique existence (primary Sjögren's syndrome) or merge with other systemic diseases like systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), rheumatoid arthritis or systemic sclerosis (secondary Sjögren's syndrome). Data on the two diseases occurrence order are inadequate. Primary Sjögren's syndrome (pSS) may relatively uncommonly lead to diffuse cystic lung changes. We represent a female who was diagnosed pSS with diffuse cystic lung alterations developed SLE two years later. SS was diagnosed on account of the existence of dryness of eye and mouth, Schirmer's test, biopsy of the minor salivary glands of her lip, positive anti-SSA and anti-SSB antibody in the serum. Chest computed tomography image showed bilateral diffuse cystic changes with a wide variation in cyst size and distribution. SLE was finally diagnosed based on bilateral lower limb skin rash, gonarthritis and omarthritis, low level of complement, antinuclear antibody 1:640 and positive antibodies to double-stranded DNA. Improvement was achieved with therapy of corticosteroids, hydroxychloroquine and antibiotics. This report provides us clinical, diagnosis and treatment perception of SS-onset SLE as patient presenting diffuse cystic lung changes.
