 oocytes, we recently showed that ATR shuts down cloned rod CNG channels, and that this inhibition occurs in the nanomolar range (aqueous concentration) at near-physiological concentrations of cGMP. Here we further characterize the ATR effect and present mechanistic information. ATR was found to decrease the apparent cGMP affinity, as well as the maximum current at saturating cGMP. When ATR was applied to outside-out patches, inhibition was much slower and less effective than when it was applied to inside-out patches, suggesting that ATR requires access to the intracellular surface of the channel or membrane. The apparent ATR affinity and maximal inhibition of heteromeric (CNGA1/CNGB1) channels was similar to that of homomeric (CNGA1) channels. Single-channel and multichannel data suggest that channel inhibition by ATR is reversible. Inhibition by ATR was not voltage dependent, and the form of its dose–response relation suggested multiple ATR molecules interacting per channel. Modeling of the data obtained with cAMP and cGMP suggests that ATR acts by interfering with the allosteric opening transition of the channel and that it prefers closed, unliganded channels. It remains to be determined whether ATR acts directly on the channel protein or instead alters channel–bilayer interactions.
