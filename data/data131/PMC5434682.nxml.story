Pregnancy-related-acute kidney injury (PR-AKI) had decreased from 40% to 20% in 1960 to <10% in recent series, mostly due to meticulous antenatal management. Postpartum-AKI (PP-AKI) resulting from late obstetric complications has become more apparent after improvement in antenatal care and legalization of medical termination of pregnancy. Women with renal injury in peripartum period admitted to our hospital over a period of 2 years (April 2013 to May 2015) were studied. Of 713 patients of AKI admitted, 61 had PR-AKI with an incidence of 4.27%. Out of the 61 patients, 28 had PP-AKI with an incidence of 1.96%. The mean age of patients with PP-AKI was 26.10 Â± 4.3 years. Sepsis was the most common cause accounting for 11 (39.28%) cases followed by postpartum hemorrhage (PPH) in 7 (25%) cases. Renal biopsy was done in nine patients, out of whom four were having cortical necrosis. Patients having diffuse cortical necrosis remained dialysis-dependent. High contribution of sepsis and PPH to PP-AKI in our setting makes it an ideal target for rectification. Protocolized peripartum monitoring and standard clinical practices of asepsis will go long way in decreasing the incidence of PP-AKI and maternal morbidity in our valley.
