The presence of anti-MDA5 antibodies in serum represents an important biomarker in the diagnosis and prediction of prognosis for patients with idiopathic inflammatory myopathies (IIMs). Due to conflicting results that have been reported regarding the detection of anti-MDA5 antibodies, the goal of this study was to assess a potential association between the presence of anti-MDA5 antibodies and dermatomyositis/polymyositis (DM/PM), as well as the diagnostic and prognostic values of anti-MDA5 antibodies for DM/PM. For this, a review of literature published prior to October 15, 2016 was conducted. Eight studies with 286 PM patients and 216 healthy controls and nine studies with 628 DM patients and 221 healthy controls were selected according to specific inclusion criteria. The outcomes of these studies revealed that the presence of anti-MDA5 antibodies was associated with DM, especially CADM, and not with PM. Furthermore, the pooled sensitivity, specificity, and area under the curve (AUC) values were 0.62 (95% confidence interval (CI): 0.52–0.70), 1.00 (95% CI: 0.97–1.00), and 0.9381 for CADM patients versus healthy controls when an immunoprecipitation method was used. The presence of anti-MDA5 antibodies was also found to be significantly associated with an increased risk of death in DM (relative risk = 3.32, 95% CI: 1.65–6.67,
