A recently introduced mathematical notion called dynamical compensation of biological circuits was shown to play an important role in glucose homeostasis and other key physiological regulatory mechanisms. This paper explains how dynamical compensation can be formulated in terms of a well-known concept in systems biology, statistics, and control theoryâ€”that of parameter structural non-identifiability. Viewing dynamical compensation as a parameter identification problem enables one to take advantage of powerful theoretical and computational tools to test a system for dynamical compensation. As a special case, one obtains the sufficient criterion for dynamical compensation. The paper also draws connections to system equivalence and to the fold-change detection property. The non-identifiability characterization brings up an interesting contrast in the way in which one thinks of these properties in the two fields. From the point of view of robustness of behavior, one wishes that parameters do not influence much the response of a system. On the other hand, from the systems and parameter identification point of view, the more that a parameter affects behavior, the easier it is to estimate it, and poor sensitivity is taken as an indication of a poorly parametrized model.
