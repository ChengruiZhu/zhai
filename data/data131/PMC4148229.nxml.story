The hypersensitive pathogen defense response (HR) in plants typically consists of a rapid, localized cell death around the point of attempted pathogen penetration. It is found in all plant species and is associated with high levels of resistance to a wide range of pathogens and pests including bacteria, fungi, viruses, nematodes, parasitic plants and insects. Little is known about the control of HR after initiation, largely because it is so rapid and localized and therefore difficult to quantify. Here we use a mutant maize gene conferring an exaggerated HR to quantify HR levels in a set of 3,381 mapping lines characterised at 26.5 million loci to identify genes associated with naturally-occurring variation in HR. Many of these genes seem to be involved in a set of connected regulatory pathways including protein degradation, control of programmed cell death, recycling of cellular components and regulation of oxidative stress. We have also shown that several of these genes show high levels of expression induction during HR. The study provides the first comprehensive list of natural variants in maize genes that modulate HR and cluster within reported pathways underlying molecular events during HR.
