Studies have shown that LPS-preconditioned tolerant state could protect against brain injury to subsequent challenges. We hypothesized astrocytes were directly involved in the readjustment to confer neuroprotective effects with LPS pretreatment. High-mobility group box 1(HMGB-1) from LPS-preconditioned astrocytes, presumably serving as a positive regulator, might contribute to the favorable preconditioned effects. Furthermore, a potential cellular pathway (PI3K/AKT pathway), has been proposed for the active regulation of LPS-primed reactive astrocytes to secrete HMGB-1. In the present study, we used a low concentration of LPS to directly prime the astrocytes in vitro, and the subsequent astrocytic reactions, including cytokine secretion, the expression of transcription factors, and the release of HMGB-1 were examined after the blockade of the PI3K pathway. The data showed that LPS preconditioning could reduce some capacity of astrocytes to subsequent challenge in vitro. PI3K/AKT pathway was partially involved in the modulation of the release HMGB-1 from reactive astrocytes. These findings offer direct evidence supporting the flexible roles of astrocytes in mediating LPS-primed neuroprotection, and highlight additional targets for future attempts to modify the protective effects of astrocytes through LPS preconditioning.
