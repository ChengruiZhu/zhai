Multiple myeloma is the second most common hematologic malignancy in the US. Treatments utilizing alkylating agents, corticosteroids, proteasome inhibitors, and immunomodulatory drugs have resulted in significant survival benefits, however, despite the advances, relapse is inevitable. Decreased depth and duration of response obtained with each successive relapse of disease is typical of the disease course, thereby highlighting a continuing need for new treatment options. With the introduction of monoclonal antibodies for multiple myeloma, new options for treatment in the relapsed setting are on the horizon. Among the new immunologic agents is daratumumab (DARA), a humanized antibody to CD38 with potent multifaceted antitumor activity. Phase I and II clinical trials have demonstrated significant reduction in serum M-protein and bone marrow plasma cell percentage in refractory patients, with an acceptable toxicity profile. Moreover, ex vivo studies have shown that DARA may be particularly useful in combination with currently used anti-myeloma agents. With a recent breakthrough drug designation by the US Food and Drug Administration, DARA shows promise as mono- and combination therapy for the treatment of relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma.
