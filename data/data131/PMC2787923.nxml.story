The brain processes information with extraordinary efficiency, and can perform feats such as effortlessly recognizing objects from among thousands of possibilities within a fraction of a second. This is accomplished because the brain represents and processes information in a distributed fashion and in a dynamical way. This processing is manifested in spatiotemporal neural activity patterns of great complexities within the brain. Here, we construct a spiking neural circuit that can reproduce some of the complexities, which are evident in terms of multiple wave patterns with interactions between each other. We show that their dynamics can support propagating pattern-based computation; spiking wave patterns signal information by propagating across neural circuits, and computational operations occur when they collide with each other. Such dynamical computation contrasts sharply with that done by static and physically fixed logic gates operating in other computing machines such as computers. Moreover, we elucidate that the collective dynamics of multiple, interacting wave patterns enable computation processing implemented in a fundamentally distributed and parallel manner in the neural circuit.
