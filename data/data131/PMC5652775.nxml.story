Retinal neovascularization (RNV) related disease is the leading cause of irreversible blindness in the world. The aim of this study is to identify whether salubrinal could attenuate RNV by inhibiting CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein (C/EBP) homologous protein (CHOP)- hypoxia inducible factors 1α (HIF1α) -vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) pathways in both mouse retinal microvascular endothelial cells (mRMECs) and oxygen-induced retinopathy (OIR) mouse model. After being treated with salubrinal (20μmol/L) or CHOP-siRNA, mRMECs were exposed to a hypoxia environment. OIR mice were intraperitoneally injected with salubrinal (0.5 mg/kg/day) from P12 to P17. With salubrinal or CHOP-siRNA treatment, the elevated CHOP protein and mRNA levels in hypoxia-induced mRMECs were significantly decreased. HIF1α-VEGF pathways were activated under hypoxia condition, then HIF1α protein was degraded and VEGF secretion was down-regulated after salubrinal or CHOP-siRNA treatment. In OIR mice, the areas of RNV were markedly decreased with salubrinal treatment. Moreover, elevated expressions of CHOP, HIF1α and VEGF in retinas of OIR mice were all reduced after salubrinal treatment. It suggested that salubrinal attenuated RNV in mRMECs and OIR mice by inhibiting CHOP-HIF1α-VEGF pathways and could be a potential therapeutic target for hypoxia-induced retinal microangiopathy.
