Large-scale mRNA concentration measurements are a hallmark of our post-genomic era. Usually they are taken as a surrogate for the corresponding protein concentrations. For most genes, proteins are the actual cellular players, but up to now it has been much more difficult to measure protein concentrations than mRNA concentrations. However, due to numerous posttranscriptional regulation mechanisms, mRNA levels only partly correlate with protein concentrations. Based on thoroughly composed reference datasets for protein and mRNA concentrations in yeast under standard growth conditions, we report the best corresponding correlation so far. We took into account additional factors, beyond mRNA concentrations, that influence protein levels in order to improve protein level predictions. Extending our previous approach, where ribosome occupancy and ribosome density were considered, we now also consider ORF-specific translation elongation rates. Different measures for elongation velocity were examined, and the codon adaptation index was found to be most appropriate. Moreover, saturation kinetics were introduced to better describe the translation process. The general findings were also applied to four stress conditions. Three new concepts, translation on demand, just-in-time translation, and general and specific posttranscriptional stress responders, are discussed.
