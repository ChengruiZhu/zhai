 study therefore analyzed the morphological and phenotypic changes undergone by benign myoepithelial cells from pleomorphic adenoma (PA) stimulated by tumor-conditioned medium. The benign myoepithelial cells were obtained from PA and were cultured with fibronectin extracellular matrix protein, supplemented with tumor-conditioned medium, which was harvested from breast ductal adenocarcinoma AU-565 and melanoma Hs 852.T cells. The morphological alterations were assessed by immunofluorescence analysis using vimentin antibody. The α-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA) and fibroblast growth factor (FGF)-2 proteins were analyzed by indirect immunofluorescence and quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR). No morphological changes were observed in the myoepithelial cells cultured in fibronectin protein under stimulation from either tumor-conditioned medium. The immunofluorescence results, which were supported by qPCR analysis, revealed that only α-SMA was upregulated in the fibronectin substratum, with or without tumor-conditioned medium obtained from breast ductal adenocarcinoma and melanoma cells. No significant difference in FGF-2 mRNA expression was detected when the cells were cultured either in the tumor-conditioned medium or in the fibronectin substratum. The tumor-conditioned medium harvested from breast ductal adenocarcinoma and melanoma did not affect myoepithelial cell differentiation and function, which was reflected by the fact that there was no observed increase in α-SMA and FGF-2 expression, respectively.
