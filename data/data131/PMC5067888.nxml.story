This is a 69-year-old man with post-renal-transplant urothelial carcinoma determined to be of donor origin. His course was complicated by BK virus at six years post-transplant; urothelial carcinoma was identified nine years post-transplant. Cystectomy was performed, but because of immunosuppression and underlying chronic kidney disease, the patient was considered ineligible for adjuvant chemotherapy. Two years after resection, screening MRI demonstrated retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy and a right upper pole mass in the transplanted kidney. Urine cytology confirmed the presence of malignant cells; FISH showed 2-8 copies of the X chromosome and no Y chromosome consistent with female origin of the malignant cells. CT-guided renal mass and paraaortic lymph node biopsies demonstrated that about 50 % of cells had an XY complement, while the remainder showed a XX genotype by chromosomal SNP microarray analysis. Immunosuppression was discontinued and the donor kidney removed. X/Y FISH of the urothelial carcinoma identified in the explanted kidney confirmed that the malignant cells were of female donor origin. Follow-up at 3, 6 and 12 months after discontinuation of immunosuppression and surgery demonstrated normalization of the lymphadenopathy and absence of new lesions.
