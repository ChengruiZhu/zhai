Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) requires one of the chemokine coreceptors CCR5 or CXCR4 for entry into the host cell. The capacity of the virus to use one or both of these coreceptors is termed tropism. Monitoring HIV tropism is of high importance due to the relationship of the emergence of CXCR4-tropic virus with the progression of immunodeficiency and for patient treatment with the recently developed CCR5 antagonists. Computational methods for predicting HIV tropism are based on sequence and on structure of the third variable region (V3 loop) of the viral gp120 protein â€” the major determinant of the HIV tropism. Limitations of the existing methods include the limited insights they provide into the biochemical determinants of coreceptor usage, high computational load of the structure-based methods and low prediction accuracy on clinically derived patient samples. Here we propose a numerical descriptor of the V3 loop encoding the physicochemical and structural properties of the loop. The new descriptor allows for server-based prediction of viral tropism with accuracy comparable to that of established sequence-based methods both on clonal and clinically derived patient data as well as for the interpretation of the properties of the loop relevant for tropism. The server is available under
