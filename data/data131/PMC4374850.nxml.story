Autophagy is a cellular process used by cells to prevent the accumulation of toxic substances. It delivers misfolded proteins and damaged organelles by fusing autophagosomes—organelles formed by a double membrane that surrounds the “debris” to be eliminated—with lysosomes. How this fusion process is regulated during autophagy, however, remains to be established. Here, we analyze this process in flies and mice, and find that loss of different subunits of a specific type of Voltage Gated Calcium Channel (VGCC) leads to defects in lysosomal fusion with autophagosomes in neurons. It was already known that VGCCs control calcium entry at synaptic terminals to promote the fusion of synaptic vesicles with the plasma membrane, and that mutations in the subunits of VGCCs in humans cause neurological diseases. Our data indicate that defects in autophagy and lysosomal fusion are independent of defects in synaptic vesicle fusion and neurotransmitter release, and we show that a specific VGCC is present on lysosomal membranes where it is required for lysosomal fusion with endosomes and autophagosomes. These observations suggest that the fusion events required in autophagy rely on mechanisms similar to those that trigger the fusion of synaptic vesicles with the presynaptic membrane.
