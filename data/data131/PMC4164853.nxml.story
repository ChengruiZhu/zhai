Chemokines are molecules able to induce chemotaxis of monocytes, neutrophils, eosinophils, lymphocytes and fibroblasts. The complex chemokine acts in many physiological and pathological phenomena, including those occurring in the articular cartilage. To date, chemokine CX3CL1 (fractalkine) is the only member of the CX3C class of chemokines with well-documented roles in endothelial cells. CX3CL1 is a unique chemokine that combines properties of chemoattractant and adhesion molecule. The main roles of CX3CL1 include promotion of leukocyte binding and adhesion as well as activation of the target cells. The soluble chemokine domain of CX3CL1 is chemotactic for T cells and monocytes. CX3CL1 acts via its receptor, CX3CR1, which belongs to a family of G protein-coupled receptors. Stimulation of CX3CR1 activates both CX3CL1-dependent and integrin-dependent migrations of cells with synergistically augmented adhesion. Genetic polymorphisms of CX3CR1 may significantly modify the biological roles of CX3CL1, especially in pathologic conditions. Osteoarthritis (OA) is the most common joint disease, affecting approximately 7–8 % of the general population. Development of OA is largely driven by low-grade local background inflammation involving chemokines. The importance of CX3CL1/CX3CR1 signalling in the pathophysiology of OA is still under investigation. This paper, based on a review of the literature, updates and summarises the current knowledge about CX3CL1/CX3CR1 in OA and indicates possible interactions with a potential for therapeutic targeting.
