Transfer RNAs are an important component of the translation machinery. Despite extensive biochemical investigations, a systems-level investigation of tRNAs' functional roles in physiology, and genetic interactions among them, is lacking. We created a comprehensive tRNA deletion library in yeast and assessed the essentiality of each tRNA in multiple conditions. The majority of tRNA deletions showed no appreciable fitness defect when such strains were grown on rich medium. More challenging environmental conditions, however, revealed a richer set of specific-tRNA phenotypic defects. Co-deletion of tRNA combinations revealed that tRNAs with essential function can be compensated by members of the same or different anti-codon families. We often saw that identical tRNA gene copies contribute deferentially to fitness, suggesting that the genomic context of each gene can affect functionality. Genome-wide expression changes in response to tRNA deletions revealed two different responses. When a deleted tRNA belongs to a family which contains multiple genes with the same anti-codon, the affected cells responded by up-regulating the translation machinery, but upon deletion of singleton tRNAs, the cellular response resembled that of proteotoxic stress. Our tRNA deletion library is a unique resource that paves the way towards fully characterizing the tRNA pool and their role in cell physiology.
