A review of numerous case reports was made, in order to demonstrate the possibilities for treatment of dental disorders in patients with Cleidocranial dysplasia (CCD). In this paper, our own report, including a diagnosis of the effect on the auditory system, is presented. In addition to the triad of CCD symptoms that include hypoplastic or aplastic clavicles, impacted and supernumerary teeth, delayed closure of fontanelles and cranial sutures, impairment of the hearing system resulting in conductive hearing loss also occurs. Our own report is based on the case of a 12-year-old CCD patient, in whom Cone Beam Computed Tomography (CBCT) revealed the presence of 12 supernumerary teeth. Furthermore, a clinical examination pointed to the presence of retained deciduous teeth and a delayed eruption of permanent teeth. Orthodontic-surgical procedures were implemented, in accordance with the literature. During the course of the orthodontic treatment, a decrease in auditory sensitivity was observed, for which reason hearing tests were also performed. Conductive hearing loss was detected. As such, it is important to remember that in such cases, auditory check-ups need to be performed between the many surgical and orthodontic interventions, which usually last a few years.
