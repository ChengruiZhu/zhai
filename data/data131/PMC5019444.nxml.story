A 45-year-old woman presented to the Emergency Department complaining of severe headache for 3 hours duration associated with bilateral blurred vision, photophobia, and one attack of vomiting. Her clinical examination revealed normal vital signs and decrease in visual acuity with hazy cornea bilaterally. There were no signs of increased intracranial pressure and no neck rigidity or meningeal signs. The patient was diagnosed with bilateral acute closed angle glaucoma (AACG) with intraocular pressure of 60 mmHg in both eyes. She was using escitalopram for the treatment of depression, which was the only known risk factor for her condition. Standard treatment for AACG was provided. It included topical β-blocker, α agonists, and acetazolamide. This was followed by bilateral peripheral iridotomy. Follow-up intraocular pressure measurement revealed a value of 5 mmHg after 24 hours, indicating complete recovery. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first case to describe AACG after stopping the medication. It is highly important that clinicians be aware of this risk factor for AACG and have high index of suspicion in such patients with vision-threatening condition even after discontinuing the medication, because the risk persists for some time.
