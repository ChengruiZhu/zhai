Biochanin A (BCA), a natural dietary isoflavone, has been reported to show anticancer activities. However, its low biological availability and poor aqueous solubility limit its usefulness as a chemotherapeutic agent. We developed BCA-loaded micelles with Pluronic F127 and Plasdone S630 (BCA-FS). The optimized, spherical-shaped BCA-FS was obtained at a ratio of 1:1 (F127:S630). The particle size was 25.17±1.2 nm, and the zeta potential was −10.9±0.24 mV. BCA solubility in water increased to 5.0 mg/mL after encapsulation, and the drug-loading efficiency was 5.88%±0.76%. In vitro release experiments showed a delayed release of BCA from the mixed micelles. Furthermore, the BCA absorption permeability across a Caco-2 cell monolayer from the apical side to the basolateral side increased by 54% in BCA-FS. A pharmacokinetics evaluation showed a 2.16-fold increase in the relative oral bioavailability of BCA-FS compared with raw BCA, indicating that the mixed micelles may promote absorption in the gastrointestinal tract. A gastrointestinal safety assay was used to assess the reliability and safety of BCA-FS. On the basis of these findings, we conclude that this simple nanomicelle system could be leveraged to deliver BCA and other hydrophobic drugs.
