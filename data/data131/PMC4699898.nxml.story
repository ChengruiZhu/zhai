The SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complex is made of multiple subunits, and the inclusion of different mutually exclusive subunits allows potentially many biochemically distinct forms of SWI/SNF. Members of this complex are among the most frequently mutated genes in cancer. Here, we present the first genome-wide localization maps of three mutually exclusive ARID subunits, and identify their role in regulating transcription. The ARID subunits have largely overlapping localization, and affect transcription of many of the same genes. Within these overlapping classes we identified extensive cooperation between ARID1B and ARID2 in the repression of hundreds of genes, as well as competitive interactions between ARID1A and the other ARIDs. These distinct regulatory modalities were characterized by co-localization with specific transcription factors. Together these data provide insight into the functional relationships between multiple distinct SWI/SNF complexes. SWI/SNF controls gene expression at thousands of genes and in most of these cases multiple distinct forms of the complex interact to specify the geneâ€™s transcription status in a particular cell. Understanding the role of each distinct form of SWI/SNF within a cell is a critical first step towards untangling the effects of SWI/SNF subunit loss in cancer.
