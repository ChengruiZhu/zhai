Colorectal cancer (CRC) ranks the third most commonly diagnosed cancer in males and the second in females worldwide. However, the functional and causal SNPs for CRC remain to be mined. Glucose transporter 1 (GLUT1), a pivotal rate-limiting element in the transport of glucose in malignancy cells, has been identified to be associated with many cancers. Here, we aim to explore the role of GLUT1 in the occurrence and prognosis of colorectal cancer in a Chinese population. We found that GLUT1 expression levels in CRC tumor tissues were significantly higher than those in the corresponding adjacent normal tissues, and Cox multivariate analysis demonstrated that the GLUT1 expression was an independent prognostic factor for CRC (HR = 2.11, 95% CI = 1.33â€“3.34, P=0.001). For a functional polymorphism of GLUT1 (rs710218), we found that individuals with TT genotype (OR = 1.68, 95% CI = 1.02-2.75, P = 0.041) or AT genotype (OR = 1.47, 95% CI = 1.09-1.99, P = 0.012) of rs710218 had a significantly increased risk of CRC compared to those with AA homozygote. These findings strongly suggest that glucose metabolism related gene GLUT1, and its functional SNP, rs710218 might contribute to CRC susceptibility and prognosis, and the exact biological mechanism awaits further research.
