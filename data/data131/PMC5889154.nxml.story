Obtaining neuroimaging in patients on cardiopulmonary support devices such as extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) can be challenging, given the complexities in monitoring, instrumentation, and associated hemodynamic lability. Transcranial Doppler (TCD) is used as an ancillary test for the assessment of cerebral circulatory arrest, but its use in non-pulsatile blood flow in venoarterial (VA) ECMO is not well described. We report the use of TCD in a patient on VA ECMO post-cardiac arrest for evaluation of death by neurological criteria.Â A 72-year-old female was admitted for elective trans-catheter aortic valve replacement. Her postoperative course was complicated by hemo-pericardium evolving into pulseless electrical activity causing cardiac arrest. She was resuscitated with return of spontaneous circulation and initiated on VA ECMO and intra-aortic balloon pump for cardiogenic shock. Over the next few days, serial evaluations persistently showed a poor neurological examination. She was too unstable to transport for neuroimaging. Evaluation for death by neurological criteria was performed with a clinical examination, apnea testing, and TCD as an ancillary study. TCD showed systolic spikes supporting an impression of cerebral circulatory arrest consistent with an irreversible brain injury.
