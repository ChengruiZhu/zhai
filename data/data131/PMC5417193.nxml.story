 sepsis in four referral hospitals recruiting patients at least 14 years of age admitted between March 2010 and December 2013. One hundred and nineteen patients with severe staphylococcal sepsis were enrolled. Diabetes was the most common underlying condition. Methicillin-resistant infection was rare. Twenty-eight-day mortality was 20%. Ninety-two percent of patients received appropriate antibiotic therapy and 82% were administered intravenous fluids on the first hospital day, although only 14% were managed in an intensive care unit (ICU). On univariable analysis, clinical variables at enrollment significantly associated with death at 28 days were coagulopathy or respiratory failure. Plasma interleukin (IL)-8 concentration alone accurately predicted mortality (area under the receiver operating curve = 0.82, 95% confidence interval = 0.73â€“0.90). In multivariable analysis, addition of IL-8 concentration to a mortality prediction model containing clinical variables further improved the predictive ability of the model. We conclude that severe staphylococcal sepsis in northeast Thailand causes significant mortality. Diabetes is a common preexisting condition and most patients are managed outside the ICU even if they receive vasoactive/inotropic agents or mechanical ventilation. While clinical factors apparent on presentation including coagulopathy and respiratory failure predict death, plasma IL-8 improves this prediction.
