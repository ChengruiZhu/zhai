Tumor necrosis factor α-induced protein-8 like-2 (TIPE2) is a gene that maintains immune homeostasis. The aim of the present study was to determine whether TIPE2 is associated with renal cell carcinoma (RCC) progression. The mRNA expression levels of TIPE2 and myxoma resistance protein 1 (MX1; a type I interferon-inducible gene) were investigated in renal cancer tissues. A total of 46 patients who fulfilled the RCC criteria of the World Health Organization (WHO; revised in 2004) and 39 control patients with renal contusions requiring surgical extraction were enrolled. Tumor and normal renal tissues were sampled from all subjects through surgery. Total RNA was extracted and the expression of the TIPE2 and MX1 genes was evaluated by quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) analysis. TIPE2 mRNA expression was significantly upregulated in the RCC patients compared with the controls (P=0.001), while MX1 mRNA expression was decreased in the RCC patients compared with the controls (P=0.0001). Furthermore, the TIPE2 mRNA expression levels were positively correlated with TNM staging (r=0.803, P=0.001) and showed a negative correlation with the MX1 mRNA expression levels (r=−0.763, P=0.001) in the RCC patients. These results indicate that the increased expression of the TIPE2 gene is markedly associated with RCC and suggests an important role for the TIPE2 gene in the pathogenesis of RCC.
