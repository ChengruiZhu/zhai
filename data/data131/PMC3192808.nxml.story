Many biochemical interactions are mediated by multivalent binding where signaling proteins use relatively weak promiscuous interactions to increase the strength and specificity of complex formation. For a bivalent adaptor protein binding to a multivalent ligand, the tethering of one of the adaptors binding sites to a motif on a multivalent ligand constrains the adaptors second binding site to a region with a high local concentration of ligand binding motifs. Intramolecular equilibrium constants associated with multivalency are difficult to measure. Typically, polymer models are utilized to estimate the enhancement in local concentration and, when the biomolecular equilibrium constants for the individual sites are known, to obtain intramolecular equilibrium constants. However, flexibility of structured regions in proteins that contain the binding motifs restricts the application of simple polymer models for many systems. Here, we develop a hybrid method combining molecular dynamics simulations and polymer models to estimate the intramolecular equilibrium constants. We apply this method to study the multivalent interactions between the widely expressed adaptor protein growth factor receptor bound protein-2 (Grb2) and the nucleotide exchange factor son of sevenless 1 (Sos1).
