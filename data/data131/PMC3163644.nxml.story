Interleukin 22 (IL-22) is a T-cell secreted cytokine that modulates inflammatory response in nonhematopoietic tissues such as epithelium and liver. The function of IL-22 in adipose tissue is currently unknown. We generated a transgenic mouse model with overexpression of IL-22 specifically in adipose tissue. The IL-22 transgenic mice had no apparent changes in obesity and insulin resistance after feeding with high fat diet (HFD). Unexpectedly, all the IL-22 transgenic mice fed with HFD for four months developed spontaneous tumors in epididymal adipose tissue. Histological analysis indicated that the tumors were well-differentiated liposarcomas with infiltration of inflammatory cells. IL-22 overexpression promotes production of inflammatory cytokines such as IL-1β and IL-10 and stimulates ERK phosphorylation in adipose tissue. Furthermore, IL-22 treatment in differentiated 3T3-L1 adipocytes could induce IL-1β and IL-10 expression, together with stimulation of ERK phosphorylation. Taken together, our study not only established a novel mouse model with spontaneous liposarcoma, but also revealed that IL-22 overexpression may collaborate with diet-induced obesity to impact on tumor development in mouse.
