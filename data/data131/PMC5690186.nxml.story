Unlike other commercial treatment planning systems (TPS) which model the rounded leaf end differently (such as the MLC dosimetric leaf gap (DLG) or rounded leaf‐tip radius), the RayStation TPS (RaySearch Laboratories, Stockholm, Sweden) models transmission through the rounded leaf end of the MLC with a step function, in which the radiation transmission through the leaf end is the square root of the average MLC transmission factor. We report on the optimization of MLC model parameters for the RayStation planning system. This (TPS) models the rounded leaf end of the MLC with the following parameters: leaf‐tip offset, leaf‐tip width, average transmission factor, and tongue and groove. We optimized the MLC model parameters for IMRT in the RayStation v. 4.0 planning system and for a Varian C‐series linac with a 120‐leaf Millennium MLC, and validated the model using measured data. The leaf‐tip offset is the geometric offset due to the rounded leaf‐end design and resulting divergence of the light/radiation field. The offset value is a function of the leaf‐tip position, and tabulated data are available from the vendor. The leaf‐tip width was iteratively evaluated by comparing computed and measured transverse dose profiles of MLC defined fields at
