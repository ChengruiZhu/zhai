This study assessed the hypothesis that the protein levels of high mobility group box 1 (HMGB1) and hepsin can be used as markers for diagnosis and prognosis in cervical carcinoma. Seventy patients with cervical cancer who were hospitalized in Xuzhou Central Hospital from May 2008 to June 2010 and underwent surgical treatment were selected for the observation group. At the same time, 20 patients with cervical benign lesions who underwent tumor stripping or accessory resection were selected for the control group. Immunohistochemical (SP) detection methods were used to detect hepsin and HMGB1 protein levels in tissues. The positive rates of HMGB1 cells in normal, paracancerous and cancerous cervical tissues were 5.0% (1/20), 22.9% (16/70) and 95.7% (67/70) (F=24.581, P=0.001) respectively. The positive rates of hepsin in normal, paracancerous and cancerous cervical tissues were respectively 10% (2/20), 61% (43/70) and 90% (63/70) (F=11.538, P=0.001). The HMGB1 expression level was related to the degree of tumor differentiation, lymph node metastasis and TNM stage (P<0.05). While the level of hepsin expression was related to the degree of tumor differentiation, invasion depth, lymph node metastasis and TNM stage (P<0.05). Furthermore, a positive correlation between the levels of hepsin and HMGB1 was found (r=15.27, P<0.05). The overall 5-year survival rates of patients with high expression of HMGB1 (+++) and low expression of HMGB1 (+ to ++) were respectively 51.2 and 29.2% (HR=11.637, 95% CI=4.351–38.213; P=0.002). The overall 5-year survival rates of patients with high hepsin expression (+++) and low hepsin expression (+ to ++) were respectively 41.3 and 35.3% (HR=10.143, 95% CI=4.285–33.275; P=0.006). Based on our results, the higher the levels of expression of hepsin and HMGB1 in tissues the higher the degree of invasiveness of the cervical cancers, and the worse the prognoses for the patient.
