The design and synthesis of mechanically responsive materials is interesting because they are potential candidates to convert thermal energy into mechanical work. Reported in this paper are thermosalient effects in a series of halogen derivatives of salinazids. The chloro derivative, with higher electronegativity and a weaker inter-halogen bond strength (Cl⋯Cl) exhibits an excellent thermal response, whereas the response is weaker in the iodo derivative with stronger I⋯I halogen bonding. 3,5-Di­chloro­salinazid (Compound-A) exists in three polymorphic forms, two room-temperature polymorphs (Forms I and II) and one high-temperature modification (Form III). The transformation of Form I to Form III upon heating at 328–333 K is a reversible thermosalient transition, whereas the transformation of Form II to Form III is irreversible and non-thermosalient. 3,5-Di­bromo- (Compound-B) and 3-bromo-5-chloro- (Compound-C) salinazid are both dimorphic: the Form I to Form II transition in Compound-B is irreversible, whereas Compound-C shows a reversible thermosalient effect (362–365 K). In the case of 3,5-di­iodo­salinazid (Compound-D) and 3,5-di­fluoro­salinazid (Compound-E), no phase transitions or thermal effects were observed. The thermosalient behaviour of these halosalinazid molecular crystals is understood from the anisotropy in the cell parameters (an increase in the
