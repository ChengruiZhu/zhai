The protein universe is under constant expansion and is reshaping through multiple duplication, gene losses, lateral gene transfers, and speciation events. Large and functionally heterogeneous protein families that evolve through these processes contain conserved motifs and structural scaffolds, yet their individual members often perform diverse functions. For this reason, the exact functional annotation for their individual members is difficult without detailed analysis of the family. In our study, we performed such a detailed analysis of a particularly heterogeneous FGGY kinase family through the integration of several computational approaches. The combination of phylogenetic and molecular approaches allowed us to precisely assign function to hundreds of proteins, thus reconstructing carbohydrate utilization pathways in almost 200 bacterial species. This analysis also showed that different molecular mechanisms could evolve within a group of isofunctional proteins. Moreover, based on our experience with this specific protein family of FGGY kinases, we believe that our approach can be generally adapted for the analyses of other protein families and that the accumulation of evolutionary models for various families would lead to a better understanding of the protein universe.
