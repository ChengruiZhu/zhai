Primitive neuroectodermal tumor (PNET) is a term used to describe a group of highly malignant neoplasms of soft-tissue origin, with varying degrees of divergent differentiation. The occurrence of peripheral PNET in the head and neck region has been reported infrequently in the medical literature. This disease generally occurs in adolescents and young adults, and rarely occurs in children <3 years old. The current study presents an extremely rare case of pPNET of the parotid gland in a 2-year-old male, which had been previously misdiagnosed and treated as a mumps. The lesion showed the characteristic histological features of pleomorphic cellular infiltrate with hyperchromatic small cells scattered in the fibrovascular stroma, interposed by fibrous septa and Homer-Wright rosettes. Positive immunohistochemical staining for CD99 and vimentin was detected. The patient was treated with chemotherapy and radiotherapy following surgical removal, and has been under close observation since the treatment (approximately seven months), with no signs of recurrence. The clinical history and radiological and histopathological findings are presented, together with the immunoreactivity of this tumor.
