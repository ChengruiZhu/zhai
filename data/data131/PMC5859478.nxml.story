When pathogenic stresses are recognized by innate immune cells, inflammasomes are assembled and caspase-1 is activated, resulting in the conversion of pro-IL-18 into mature IL-18. Because natural killer (NK) cells express IL-18 receptors, IL-18 may play roles in immune functions of NK cells. In the present study, we examined the effect of IL-18 on NK cells derived from lung cancer patients and healthy adult volunteers. When peripheral blood NK cells were stimulated with IL-2, the cells formed clusters beginning on day 5-6 and proliferated thereafter, in which the number of NK cells increased by 10-fold in 10 days. When IL-18 was added, cell clusters were observed as early as on day 4 and NK cells proliferated vigorously. On day 10, the expansion rate was 56-fold on average, showing that IL-18 promoted the expansion of NK cells. It was also notable that IL-18 enhanced the expression of CD80, CD86, HLA-DR and HLA-DQ on NK cells, suggesting that IL-18 conferred NK cells an APC-like phenotype. When cellular cytotoxicity was determined, APC-like NK cells efficiently killed tumor cells and anti-tumor activity was augmented by the addition of tumor antigen-specific mAbs. In addition, IFN-Î³ was produced by APC-like NK cells in response to tumor cells, and the cytokine production was further enhanced by mAbs. Taken together, IL-18 not only promoted the expansion of NK cells, but also changed the phenotype of NK cells. IL-2/IL-18-induced NK cells might, therefore, serve as a bridge between innate immunity and adaptive immunity and be useful for cancer immunotherapy.
