In this article we describe methods in which unstimulated mouse peritoneal macrophages were induced to secrete high livels of plasminogen activator under in vitro conditions. The exposure of sensitized peritoneal or spleen cell populations from Trypanosoma cruzi- infected animals to either viable or heat-killed trypanosomes lead to the release of an inducing factor(s). Maximal levels of plasminogen activator secretion are achieved by the incubation of such factors (s) with unstimulated macrophages for 48 h. A significant increase in enzyme secretion was already observed after a 24 h incubation. The production of the inducing factor(s) by sensitized cells was immunologically specific and unrelated antigens did not stimulate the production of the factor(s) by sensitized peritoneal or spleen cell populations. The inducing factor(s) was produced by nylon-wool- fractionated spleen and peritoneal cells which had been depleted of marcrophages. Pretreatment of sensitized spleen cells with anti-theta serum and C abolished the production of the activating factor(s). The active supernatant fluids were able to induce secretion of macrophage plasminogen activator across H-2 barriers. Attempts to induce trypanocidal activity in unstimulated macrophages have not been successful.
