Measurements of the rates at which a single cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) can survey for infected cells, and kill them upon encounter, are important for constructing predictive models of vertebrate immune responses to intracellular pathogens. The surveillance rate has been estimated previously using combinations of modeling and experiment, making the assumption that CTL and target cells are well-mixed and that all cell types are killed with equal efficiency. In this study we take an iterative approach with theory and experiment to go beyond such models and detail the effects of cellular heterogeneity, the spatial organisation of the tissue within which killing is taking place, and the influence of the level of expression of peptides on the target cell surface. We demonstrate that determining the degree of co-localisation of effector and target cells, and the level of peptide expression on targets, are most important for improving estimates of CTL killing rates. Further, while the probabilities of killing upon conjugation of CTL with T and B cell targets are similar, T cells take substantially longer to kill than B cells, an effect that may be important when CTL numbers are limiting.
