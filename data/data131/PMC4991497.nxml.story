Atg9 is a multispanning transmembrane protein that is required for autophagosome formation. During autophagy, vesicles containing Atg9 are generated through an unknown mechanism and delivered to the autophagosome formation sites. We have previously reported that Atg9-containing membranes undergo continuous tubulation and fission during nutrient starvation in a manner dependent on the curvature-inducing protein Bif-1/Sh3glb1. Here, we identify Dynamin 2 (DNM2) as a Bif-1-interacting protein that mediates the fission of Atg9-containing membranes during autophagy. The interaction of Bif-1 and DNM2 is enhanced upon nutrient starvation, and Bif-1 and DNM2 cooperatively induce the generation of Atg9-containing vesicles. Inhibition of the GTPase activity of DNM2 results in the accumulation of Atg9-positive tubular structures that originate from a Rab11-positive reservoir. Although Atg9 seems to be constitutively trafficked to the reservoir regardless of Bif-1 expression, membrane tubulation from the Atg9 reservoir is dependent on Bif-1 and is strongly induced upon nutrient starvation. These findings suggest that the generation of Atg9 vesicles from a Rab11-positive reservoir is tightly controlled by the Bif-1-DNM2 membrane fission machinery in response to cellular demand for autophagy.
