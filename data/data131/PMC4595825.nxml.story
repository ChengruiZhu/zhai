Laparoscopic resection of hilar cholangiocarcinoma is technically challenging because it involves complicated laparoscopic procedures that include laparoscopic hepatoduodenal lymphadenectomy, hemihepatectomy with caudate lobectomy, and hepaticojejunostomy. There are currently very few reports describing this type of surgery. Between August 2014 and December 2014, 5 patients underwent total laparoscopic or laparoscopic-assisted surgery for hilar cholangiocarcinoma. Two patients with type I or II hilar cholangiocarcinoma underwent radical hilar resection. Three patients with type IIIa or IIIb cholangiocarcinoma underwent extended hemihepatectomy together with caudate lobectomy. The median (range) age, operation time, blood loss, and length of hospital stay were 63 years (43-76 years), 610 minutes (410-665 minutes), 650 mL (450-1,300 mL), and 12 days (9-21 days), respectively. Four patients had a negative margin, but 1 patient was diagnosed with high-grade dysplasia on the proximal resection margin. The median tumor size was 3.0 cm. One patient experienced postoperative biliary leakage, which resolved spontaneously. Laparoscopic resection is a feasible surgical approach in selected patients with hilar cholangiocarcinoma.
