IL-23p19 plays important roles in intestinal antimicrobial immunity, while its over-expression can lead to intestinal inflammation. However, the bacterial compounds and the type of pattern recognition receptor involved in the inducible expression of IL-23p19 in Paneth cells remain unclear. Here we show that the mRNA expression of IL-23p19 was increased in Paneth cell (PC)-like cells stimulated by Toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2) ligands, peptidoglycan (PGN) and Pam3CSK4, and was further increased in the presence of nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain 2 (NOD2)-ligand muramyl dipeptide (MDP). However, its mRNA expression was decreased in NOD2-knockdown PC-like cells. Additionally, the c-Rel activation was increased in Pam3CSK4- or PGN-stimulated PC-like cells, but the PGN-induced c-Rel activation was decreased in NOD2-knockdown PC-like cells and had no significant difference compared with Pam3CSK4-induced c-Rel activation. Our results suggest that NOD2 up-regulates TLR2-mediated IL-23p19 expression via increasing c-Rel activation in PC-like cells. This finding might provide us with a novel therapeutic target for inflammatory bowel disease to inhibit IL-23p19 over-expression via the NOD2-c-Rel pathway.
