Multicellular organisms are composed of a variety of cell types. Over the last years we have learned that cell differentiation is fully reversible and that it takes few specific transcription factors (proteins that bind to DNA and regulate gene expression) to convert one cell type into another. The most dramatic example is the reprogramming of somatic cells into stem cells that reacquire the potential to give rise to all cell types of the body. This process entails the resetting of the gene expression program of the somatic cells necessary to acquire a pluripotent state but remains poorly understood. Here, we defined the role in cell reprogramming of the Polycomb axis, one of the key effectors of gene silencing that operates through a specific chemical modification of histones (the trimethylation of lysine-27 on histone H3) that is stably inherited from one cell generation to the next. Surprisingly, we uncovered a selective requirement for Polycomb silencing during somatic cell reprogramming. Upon inactivation of the essential Polycomb protein EZH2, histones trimethylated on lysine-27 were retained on a selected subset of physiological Polycomb target genes whose products control normal development, and erasure of the histone mark from these critical genes abolished reprogramming.
