33 patients with active, moderate-severe Graves' ophthalmopathy (GO) received 4.5 g methylprednisolone for 12 weeks and were divided by efficacy into two groups (responsive and unresponsive). All patients and 10 controls underwent orbital MRI examination at baseline. No significant difference was seen in baseline clinical characteristics between the two GO groups. The values of exophthalmos were higher in both GO groups than in the control and were higher in the responsive group versus the unresponsive group. Compared to the unresponsive group, the responsive group had a thicker inferior rectus as well as thinner orbital fat. The inferior rectus/fat ratio was significantly higher in the responsive group versus the unresponsive group. Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that the exophthalmos value and inferior rectus/fat ratio were significantly associated with the response to glucocorticoid (GC). ROC analysis revealed that the cut-off points of the inferior rectus/fat ratio combined with the exophthalmos value to indicate efficacy were 1.42 and 20.78. For moderate-severe GO patients with CAS > 3, the combined inferior rectus/fat ratio and exophthalmos value in MRI may be a valuable indicator to predict the response to GC therapy.
