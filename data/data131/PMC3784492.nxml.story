Cells can sense their environment and respond to changes, however the sudden appearance of a stressor can be catastrophic if the time it takes to sense and initiate a response is slow relative to the action of a stressor. A possible solution is to couple a sensory response with a stochastic, random approach. In the absence of stress, a random subset of cells expresses resistance genes, ensuring that if a stressor appears there will be some cells that are able to survive and regenerate the population; once stress is sensed all cells should respond by expressing resistance genes. Such an approach is particularly advantageous when resistance mechanisms are taxing to the cell because it limits their expression when no stress is present. We studied this phenomenon computationally using a model of the multiple antibiotic resistance activator, MarA. MarA controls over 40 resistance genes and can be induced by many harmful compounds. We show that when uninduced, the gene regulatory network controlling MarA is capable of producing stochastic pulses that can serve to hedge against sudden changes in the environment with minimal cost to the population. When induced, MarA expression is elevated and has low variability to ensure a uniform response.
