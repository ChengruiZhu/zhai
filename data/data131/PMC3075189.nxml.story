Solitary rectal ulcer syndrome (SRUS) is an uncommon disorder which can present in patients being evaluated for defecatory disorders or which can present as a primary process often involving hematochezia, rectal pain and tenesmus. Unfortunately the diagnosis of this disorder is often delayed due to misdiagnosis and/or physician unfamiliarity with the condition. We present a 24-year-old female who presented with 6 months of bloody diarrhea and weight loss. She had been receiving treatment for a presumed diagnosis of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) due to an endoscopic picture of rectal thickening, edema and ulceration and had been on prednisone for 2 months prior to presentation without relief of her symptoms. After further testing including repeat endoscopy with biopsies, defecography and anorectal manometry, the diagnosis of SRUS was made and treatment was changed. Medical management was unsuccessful and she ultimately required surgical intervention. This case highlights the difficulty in diagnosing SRUS due to its resemblance to other gastrointestinal diseases and should serve as a reminder that if a patient is not responding to IBD therapy, another etiology should be considered.
