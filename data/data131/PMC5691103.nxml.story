The mammalian retina contains a high level of polyunsaturated fatty acids, including docosahexaenoic acid (22:6) (DHA), which are highly susceptible to oxidation. It has been shown that one of the products of DHA oxidation—carboxyethylpyrrole (CEP), generated in situ, causes modifications of retinal proteins and induces inflammation response in the outer retina. These contributing factors may play a role in the development of age-related macular degeneration (AMD). It is also possible that some of the lipid oxidation products are photoreactive, and upon irradiation with blue light may generate reactive oxygen species. Therefore, in this work we analysed oxidation-induced changes in photoreactivity of lipids extracted from bovine neural retinas. Lipid composition of bovine neural retinas closely resembles that of human retinas making the bovine tissue a convenient model for studying the photoreactivity and potential phototoxicity of oxidized human retinal lipids. Lipid composition of bovine neural retinas Folch’ extracts (BRex) was determined by gas chromatography (GC) and liquid chromatography coupled to an electrospray ionization source-mass spectrometer (LC-ESI-MS) analysis. Liposomes prepared from BRex, equilibrated with air, were oxidized in the dark at 37 °C for up to 400 h. The photoreactivity of BRex at different stages of oxidation was studied by EPR-oximetry and EPR-spin trapping. Photogeneration of singlet oxygen (
