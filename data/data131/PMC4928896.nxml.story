. S-motile cells are restricted to movement in groups and do not move as individual cells. S-motility is powered by type IV pili (TFP)â€“multi-subunit filaments, which extrude from the cell poles, adhere to the substrate and retract, pulling the cell forward. TFP retraction or adhesion is suggested to be triggered by extracellular exopolysaccharides (EPS) deposited by cells on the substrate. As individual cells synthesize both pili and EPS, it is unclear why S-motile cells only exhibit group movement. Moreover, the experimentally observed initial cell-density dependence of S-motility remains unexplained. To understand these phenomena, we developed a mathematical model for the colony expansion of S-motile cells. Our model hypothesizes that the EPS level regulates the TFP activity that initiates collective cell movements. With this assumption, the model quantitatively matches the density-dependent expansion rate. Moreover, the model predicts two phases during colony expansion: an initial density-dependent lag phase with a slow expansion rate, followed by a faster expansion phase with a density-independent rate. These model predictions were confirmed by long-term colony expansion experiments.
