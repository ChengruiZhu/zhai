The deubiquitinating enzyme USP14 has been identified and biochemically studied, but its role in lung cancer remains to be elucidated. The aim of this study was to evaluate the prognostic significance of USP14 in patients with lung adenocarcinoma and to define its role in lung cancer cell proliferation. USP14 mRNA levels in different non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cell lines were detected by real-time qPCR. USP14 protein levels in surgically resected samples from NSCLC patients, and in NSCLC cell lines, were detected by immunohistochemistry or Western blot. The correlation of USP14 expression with clinical characteristics and prognosis was determined by survival analysis. After silencing USP14, cell proliferation was assessed by MTT assay and the cell cycle was measured by FACS assay. It was found that USP14 expression was upregulated in NSCLC cells, especially in adenocarcinoma cells. Over-expression of USP14 was associated with shorter overall survival of patients. Downregulation of USP14 expression arrested the cell cycle, which may be related to Î²-catenin degradation. Over-expression of USP14 was associated with poor prognosis in NSCLC patients and promoted tumor cell proliferation, which suggests that USP14 is a tumor-promoting factor and a promising therapeutic target for NSCLC.
