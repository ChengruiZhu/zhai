The objective of the present study was to compare the efficacy of functional endoscopic dilatation sinus surgery (FEDS) with functional endoscopic sinus surgery (FESS) in treatment of chronic rhinosinusitis in patients who failed medical therapy. We enrolled 24 patients suffering with chronic rhinosinusitis, who failed medical treatment and were proceeding to surgery, in a prospective, randomized controlled pilot study carried out between January and December 2008 following ethical committee approval. All patients completed sino-nasal outcome test (SNOT)-20 questionnaires and underwent saccharine test preoperatively and 24 weeks post operatively. Only trained surgeons performed surgery. The SNOT-20 questionnaire and saccharine clearance time (SCT) were used to measure outcomes. The SNOT-20 scores for both patient groups showed similar, consistent symptomatic improvement compared with baseline measures. SCT was reduced in both groups. No significant post-operative complications were recorded in either group. No patient in the FEDS group had any bleeding, and all were ready for discharge within hours of the procedure. Thus, FEDS is as effective as FESS in treatment of chronic rhinosinusitis. It is can be considered an additional tool in endoscopic surgery and has the potential to be undertaken as a day procedure.
