The objective of current investigation was to study the degradation behaviour of eberconazole nitrate and mometasone furoate under different International Conference on harmonisation recommended stress condition using reverse phase high performance liquid chromatographic method and to establish validated stability-indicating high performance liquid chromatographic method to determine purity of eberconazole nitrate and mometasone furoate in presence of its impurities, forced degradation products and placebo in pharmaceutical dosage forms. The method was developed using Hypersil BDS, C18, 150Χ4.6 mm, 5 μ as stationary phase with mobile phase containing a gradient mixture of solvent A and B. 0.01 M phosphate buffer with 0.1% triethyl amine, adjusted pH 7.0 with phosphoric acid was used as buffer. Buffer pH 7.0 was used as solvent A and methanol:acetonitrile in 150:850 v/v ratios were used as solvent B. The eluted compounds were monitored at 240 nm. The run time was 50 min. The developed method was validated as per international conference on harmonization guidelines with respect to specificity, linearity, limit of detection, limit of quantification, accuracy, precision and robustness.
