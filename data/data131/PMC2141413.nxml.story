 1. Pollen mother cells exposed to low dosages of x-rays at various stages show different frequencies of chromosome abnormalities in the first meiotic anaphase. 2. Maximum frequencies of abnormalities were obtained in buds irradiated in the pachytene stage of the meiotic prophase and in the preceding mitosis. 3. These results are taken to indicate that the x-ray-sensitive portions of the chromonemata are closely approximated in pairs in pachytene and in the early mitotic prophase. The significance of this in relation to non-homologous pairing is indicated. 4. From the nature of the chromosome configurations observed it is concluded that chromonemata are two-parted when they synapse and that a chromonematic division occurs between pachytene and anaphase and during the mitotic prophase. 5. The frequencies of abnormalities show a linear relationship to dosage. 6. The diameter of the sensitive volume of the chromonema is calculated and found to approximate the diameter of some known protein molecules. 7. The linkage mechanism is found to make up about 90 per cent of the total sensitive volume which corresponds with the approximate reduction in length of the chromonema from pachytene to anaphase. 8. The relation of these sensitive volumes to the gene is discussed.
