Although studies have examined the association between nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) use and central nervous system (CNS) tumors risk, the results are inconclusive. Here, we conducted a dose-response meta-analysis in order to investigate the correlation between NSAIDs use and CNS tumors risk. Up to July 2017, 12 studies were included in current meta-analysis. NSAIDs use was significantly associated with a lower risk of CNS tumors. Furthermore, non-aspirin NSAIDs or aspirin use are significantly associated with a lower risk of CNS tumors. Additionally, NSAIDs use was associated with significantly a lower risk of glioma, glioblastoma but not meningioma. Subgroup analysis showed consistent findings. Furthermore, a significant dose-response relationship was observed between NSAIDs use and CNS tumors risk. Increasing cumulative 100 defined daily dose of NSAIDs use was associated with a 5% decrement of CNS tumors risk, increasing NSAIDs or non-aspirin NSAIDs or aspirin use (per 3 prescriptions increment) was associated with a 7%, 7%, 10% decrement of CNS tumors risk, increasing per 2 year of duration of NSAIDs or non-aspirin NSAIDs or aspirin use was associated with a 6%, 8%, 6% decrement of CNS tumors risk. Considering these promising results, NSAIDs use might provide helpful for reducing CNS tumors risk. Large sample size and different ethnic population are warranted to validate this association.
