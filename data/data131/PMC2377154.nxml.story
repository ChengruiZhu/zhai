The cerebellum or “little brain” is a fist-sized structure located towards the rear of the brain, containing as many neurons as the rest of the brain combined, whose functions include learning to perform skilled motor tasks accurately and automatically. It is wired up into repeating microcircuits, sometimes referred to as cerebellar chips, in which learning alters the strength of the synapses between the parallel fibres, which carry input information, and the large Purkinje cell neurons, which produce outputs contributing to skilled movements. The cerebellar chip has a striking resemblance to a mathematical structure called an adaptive filter used by control engineers, and we have used this analogy to analyse its information-processing properties. We show that it learns synaptic strengths that minimise the errors in performance caused by unavoidable noise in sensors and cerebellar circuitry. Optimality principles of this kind have proved to be powerful tools for understanding complex systems. Here we show that optimality explains neuronal-level features of cerebellar learning such as the mysterious preponderance of “silent” synapses between parallel fibres and Purkinje cells and behavioural-level features such as the dependence of rate of learning of a motor skill on learning history.
