Colorectal cancer (CRC) has one of the highest mortality rates in the worldwide and its incidence has been increasing in recent years. Protein tyrosine kinase-7 (PTK7) is an inactive member of receptor protein tyrosine kinase (RPTK)-like molecules, which is involved in tumorigenesis of a variety of cancers. Our study aimed to investigate expression of PTK7 in colorectal tumors (including benign adenomas and malignant carcinomas), and its potential function in tumorigenesis and prognosis. A total of 209 CRC patients and 28 colonic adenoma patients were included in this study. Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and quantitative real-time PCR were performed in 14 pairs of fresh frozen tissues to evaluate mRNA expression of PTK7. Expression of PTK7 protein in 209 CRC tissues with paired non-cancerous mucosa and 28 adenoma specimens were tested using immunohistochemistry. The expression difference and its correlation with clinicopathological features and overall survival were assessed by SPSS statistics (version 22). P<0.05 was considered significant. RT-PCR and quantitative real-time PCR showed a higher expression of PTK7 mRNA in CRC compared with non-tumorous mucosa (4.87±3.71 vs. 1.33±1.05; P<0.001). PTK7 expression was significantly higher in adenoma (75%) and CRC (68.3%) than in non-tumorous mucosa (P<0.001). PTK7 expression was correlated with tumor differentiation (P=0.027), lymph node metastasis (P=0.005), distant metastasis (P=0.001) and TNM stage (P=0.028) of CRC patients. Significant correlation between PTK7 overexpression and favorable overall survival of CRC patients was observed (P=0.005). Therefore, it may act as a candidate biomarker to predict the occurrence and prognosis of colorectal tumor.
