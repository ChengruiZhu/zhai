Lipotoxicity-induced mesangial cell apoptosis is implicated in the exacerbation of diabetic nephropathy (DN). Protein arginine methyltransferases (PRMTs) have been known to regulate a variety of biological functions. Recently, it was reported that PRMT1 expression is increased in proximal tubule cells under diabetic conditions. However, their roles in mesangial cells remain unexplored. Thus, we examined the pathophysiological roles of PRMTs in mesangial cell apoptosis. Treatment with palmitate, which mimics cellular lipotoxicity, induced mesangial cell apoptosis via protein kinase RNA-like endoplasmic reticulum kinase (PERK) and ATF6-mediated endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress signaling. Palmitate treatment increased PRMT1 expression and activity in mesangial cells as well. Moreover, palmitate-induced ER stress activation and mesangial cell apoptosis was diminished by PRMT1 knockdown. In the mice study, high fat diet-induced glomerular apoptosis was attenuated in PRMT1 haploinsufficient mice. Together, these results provide evidence that lipotoxicity-induced PRMT1 expression promotes ER stress-mediated mesangial cell apoptosis. Strategies to regulate PRMT1 expression or activity could be used to prevent the exacerbation of DN.
