. The “counter-attack” machinery may account for the mechanisms by which tumors evade host immune surveillance. In this study we determined if COX2 inhibitor could modulate effector molecules of cell death on colon cancer cells changing their effects on cytotoxic T lymphocytes. Colon adenocarcinoma cells, HCA7 and HCT116, the former COX2-positive and the latter COX2-negative, were pre-incubated with/without a COX2 inhibitor, NS398. Subsequently, the cells were co-cultured with Jurkat T cell leukemia cells and damage to Jurkat cells was determined. Treatment with NS398 resulted in reduction of expression of FasL and TRAIL in HCA7 cells, whereas NS398 did not affect the expression of FasL and TRAIL in HCT116 cells. The number of viable Jurkat cells was diminished when cells were co-cultured with naive, non-pretreated HCA7 or HCA116 cells. Preincubation of HCA7 cells with NS398 before co-culture blunted the HCA7 cell-induced cell toxicity on Jurkat cells. In contrast, pretreatment with NS398 failed to inhibit the HCT116-induced Jurkat cell killing. Our results suggest that COX2 regulates the expression of FasL and TRAIL on COX2-positive colon cancer cells thereby evoking a counter-attack against cytotoxic T cells, which may lead to compromised host immune responses.
