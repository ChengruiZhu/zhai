Background: Upon natural agonist or pharmacological stimulation, G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) are subjected to posttranslational modifications, such as phosphorylation and ubiquitination. These posttranslational modifications allow protein–protein interactions that turn off and/or switch receptor signaling as well as trigger receptor internalization, recycling or degradation, among other responses. Characterization of these processes is essential to unravel the function and regulation of GPCR. Methods: In silico analysis and methods such as mass spectrometry have emerged as novel powerful tools. Both approaches have allowed proteomic studies to detect not only GPCR posttranslational modifications and receptor association with other signaling macromolecules but also to assess receptor conformational dynamics after ligand (agonist/antagonist) association. Results: this review aims to provide insights into some of these methodologies and to highlight how their use is enhancing our comprehension of GPCR function. We present an overview using data from different laboratories (including our own), particularly focusing on free fatty acid receptor 4 (FFA4) (previously known as GPR120) and α
