Colon cancer development is closely related to inflammation. Thus, we conducted the present investigation to study the effects of IL-35 (Interleukin 35), a newly identified anti-inflammatory factor, on colon cancer development. We first evaluated the IL-35 expression in 186 pairs of colon cancer samples and paired adjacent normal tissues by qPCR, ELISA (Enzyme-linked immunoassay) and tissue microarrays. Then the role of IL-35 on patient survival rates, colon cancer progression and their sensitivity to chemotherapy drugs were assessed. IL-35 was barely expressed in the colon cancer tissue but highly expressed in the adjacent normal tissue. The down-regulation of IL-35 was significantly associated with the AJCC (American Joint Committee on Cancer) stage, nodal involvement, invasion depth, distant metastasis, differentiation and it was also shown to be an independent prognostic indicator of both disease-free and overall survivals for colon cancer patients. Overexpression of IL-35 in colon cancer cell suppressed cell migration, invasion, proliferation, colony formation and cancer stem cells through suppressing Î²-catenin. IL-35 inhibited colon tumor formation in the mice model and sensitize the cancer cell to chemotherapy drugs. Our results showed that IL-35 shows an inhibitory effect in colon cancer development and is a novel prognostic indicator. Therefore, IL-35 might be a potential therapeutic target.
