A total of 196 patients eligible for the study (126 women, 70 men) were subjected to THR. The THR procedure was performed using spinal anaesthesia after implementing routine peri-operative monitoring. After the procedure each patient was individually observed, and the patient-specific chart of dynamic changes in pain perception was recorded, using the five-level Verbal Rating Scale (VRS). The multimodal analgesic treatment after THR was defined by the operating surgeons after considering indications and contraindications to the use of different groups of drugs (opioid and non-opioid analgesics). Postoperative pain was controlled by the patient-controlled analgesia method and VRS during the day-time, as well as night-time nurse-controlled analgesia. All medication adjustments were recorded in the individual patient files. In the case of moderate pain intensity (VRS-assessed), a patient was administered the non-opioid analgesic drug, and for high intensity pain the opioid. The analysis of pain relief therapy included information on the drugs applied, mode of dosing (single or multiple), daily dose, route of administration, and drug refusal due to the absence of pain recorded each study day, i.e. on the day of surgery and recovery in the postoperative room (day 0), and then daily from day 1 to day 6.
