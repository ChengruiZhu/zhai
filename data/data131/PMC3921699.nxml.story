We observed a higher knowledge about carcinoma of prostate in group A than in group B (p <0.0001) and it increased after 5 years in group D (p <0.0001) in comparison to group C. Patients aged >40 from groups C and D were interested in health care (p<0.01) as much as patients aged 40-49, 50-59 and 60-69. In men >70 a lower level of motivation was observed. The interest was proportional to the level of education, and this was differentiating in an analogical way the motivation to extend knowledge about prostate cancer (p<0.001). The place of living was determining the level of motivation for broadening knowledge – in bigger towns in a greater extent (p <0.01). The frequency of reporting to screening tests during a period of 5 years was comparable in groups C and D, regardless of knowledge tests’ results. Health risk awareness following the education process was motivating men to undergo screening tests (p <0.05). This confirms our own research hypothesis. Regardless of the age bracket, the obtained result of knowledge test II was higher than test I and the result of test III was lower than test II, respectively: p <0.01; p <0.08; p <0.01; p <0.001. The level of knowledge test III among all examined patients was higher in comparison to test I – p <0.01; p <0.001; p <0.001 respectively. White-collar workers obtained in test I a result higher than blue-collar workers, unemployed or retired people p <0.001 and p <0.01 respectively. Unemployed and retired people obtained more scores than blue-collar workers (p <0.05). Both in professional workers and retired people test III was higher than test I – p <0.001 and p <0.001 respectively. In 7 examined men prostate cancer was diagnosed; in group B in 3 in an advanced state, and during 5 years in group C – in 4 men at an early development stage.
