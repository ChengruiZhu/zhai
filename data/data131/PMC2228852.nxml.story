A high-conductance (100 pS in 53 mM trans Ca2+) Ca2+ channel was incorporated from heavy-density skeletal muscle sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) fractions into planar lipid bilayers of the Mueller-Rudin type. cis Ca2+ in the range of 2-950 microM increased open probability (Po) in single channel records without affecting open event lifetimes. Millimolar ATP was found to be as good as or better than Ca2+ in activation; however, both Ca2+ and ATP were required to fully activate the channel, i.e., to bring Po = 1. Exponential fits to open and closed single channel lifetimes suggested that the channel may exist in many distinct states. Two open and two closed states were identified when the channel was activated by either Ca2+ or ATP alone or by Ca2+ plus nucleotide. Mg2+ was found to permeate the SR Ca channel in a trans-to- cis direction such that iMg2+/iCa2+ = 0.40. cis Mg2+ was inhibitory and in single channel recordings produced an unresolvable flickering of Ca- and nucleotide-activated channels. At nanomolar cis Ca2+, 4 microM Mg2+ completely inhibited nucleotide-activated channels. In the presence of 2 microM cis Ca2+, the nucleotide-activated macroscopic Ba conductance was inhibited by cis Mg2+ with an IC50 equal to 1.5 mM.
