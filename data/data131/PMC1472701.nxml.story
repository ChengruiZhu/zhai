The centromere is a chromosome domain essential for the correct partitioning of chromosomes during mitotic and meiotic cell divisions. MCAK is a centromeric protein that depolymerises microtubules, and seems to be implicated in chromosome segregation, and in the correction of improper microtubule interactions with the chromosome. However, there are no published data on its behaviour and function during meiotic divisions. Here, Parra et al. analyse the pattern of distribution of MCAK during male mouse meiosis in relation to Aurora-B, a kinase that regulates its activity. They show that MCAK and Aurora-B appear at the inner domain of metaphase I bivalents and unaligned metaphase II chromosomes. Most importantly, the authors discovered that these proteins relocalise to a novel perikinetochoric ring in aligned metaphase II chromosomes. The discovery of this novel structure adds a new dimension to the understanding of kinetochore structure and biology. The authors propose that, at least for mouse centromeres, the perikinetochoric ring represents a transient centromere domain whose appearance depends on tension across centromeres once microtubules interact with both sister kinetochores. This study shows that the analysis of the behaviour of different centromere proteins during meiosis can offer new insights concerning the centromere functionality.
