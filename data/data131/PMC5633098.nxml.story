Intravascular large B-cell lymphoma (IVL) is a rare type of extranodal diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), which often infiltrates the central nervous system (CNS) during the clinical course. Cerebral hemorrhage in patients with CNS lymphoma at presentation is rare. Herein, we describe a case of secondary CNS lymphoma with intratumoral hemorrhage, which was suggested as IVL from autopsy findings. A 76-year-old Japanese man with a history of treatment for B-cell non-Hodgkinâ€™s lymphoma was transferred to our hospital in an ambulance for generalized convulsions. Brain CT scan revealed a high-density tumor with edema and intratumoral hemorrhage in the left temporal lobes. He died in a rapid course, and autopsy revealed a focal hemorrhage with diffuse infiltration of lymphoma cells in the left temporal lobe and findings suggestive of IVL. Furthermore, the autopsy revealed a discrepancy in the CD20 immunostaining of lymphoma cells between the brain and other organs. Clinicians should not eliminate CNS lymphoma from the differential diagnosis of intracranial tumor with hemorrhage. Although many patients with IVL have rapidly progressive courses, it is very important to diagnose IVL at the initial onset, even in serious situations, to consider CNS prophylaxis.
