Embryonic stem cells have two remarkable properties: they can proliferate very rapidly, and they can give rise to all of the body's cell types. Understanding how gene activity is regulated in embryonic stem cells will be an important step towards therapeutic applications. The activity of genes is regulated by proteins called transcription factors, which bind to stretches of DNA sequences that act as on or off switches. We identified genes that are active in mouse embryonic stem cells but not in differentiated cells. We reasoned that if these genes have similar patterns of activity, they may be regulated by the same transcription factors. We therefore developed a computational approach that takes information on gene activity and predicts DNA sequences that may act as switches. Using this approach, we discovered new DNA switches that regulate gene activity in mouse and human embryonic stem cells. Furthermore, we identified a transcription factor that binds to one of these DNA switches and is important for the rapid proliferation of embryonic stem cells. Our approach sheds light on the genetic regulation of embryonic stem cells and will be broadly applicable to questions of how gene activity is regulated in other cell types of interest.
