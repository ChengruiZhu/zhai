The questionnaire was provided by mail to 47 physicians and 27 (57%) responded. The response rate was 79% for successful physician recruiters compared to 43% (P = 0.014) for unsuccessful physician recruiters. More successful physician recruiters (73%) than unsuccessful physician recruiters (42%) stated they had participated and enrolled patients in previous multicenter clinical trials. A significantly higher number of successful physician recruiters than unsuccessful physician recruiters (42%; P = 0.040) considered the presence of a support system with clinical research coordinators (CRC) as the reason for participation (80%). A large number of unsuccessful physician recruiters experienced difficulty in obtaining informed consent (67%), whereas a significantly smaller number of successful physician recruiters experienced such difficulty (20%; P = 0.014). The difficulties experienced by unsuccessful physician recruiters in the trial were as follows: inability to find possible participants (100%), difficulty in obtaining informed consent (58%), cumbersome procedures (58%), difficulty in long-term follow up (33%), and insufficient tools for explanation and obtaining informed consent (8%).
