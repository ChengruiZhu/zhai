Increasing evidence supports that microRNA (miRNA)-mediated gene regulation plays a significant functional role in cancer progression. To investigate the expression and clinical significance of ITGB1 in non small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), the expression levels of ITGB1 in NSCLC tissues and human normal lung tissues were analyzed in silico using genes microarray, KEGG pathway and hierarchical clustering analysis followed by validation with quantitative RT-PCR. Our results showed that ITGB1 was upregulated in NSCLC tissues when compared with normal lung tissues. Survival analysis based on the qRT-PCR data established that ITGB1 expression was attentively related to the prognosis of NSCLC, and patients with higher ITGB1 expression had shorter overall survival (OS). Moreover, ITGB1 was confirmed to be a direct target of miR-493-5p. Furthermore, concomitant high expression of ITGB1 and low expression of miR-493-5p correlated with a shorter median OS and PFS in NSCLC patients. In conclusion, our results provide the first evidence that ITGB1 is a direct target of miR-493-5p suggesting that ITGB1 and miR-493-5p may have potential prognostic value and may be useful as tumor biomarkers for the diagnosis of NSCLC patients.
