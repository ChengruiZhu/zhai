The study included 669 patients, 225 patients infected with HCV (group A) and 444 patients co-infected with HCV/HIV (group B). The comparative analysis of those groups (A vs. B) showed: mean age was 49.4 years versus 46.9 (p<0.01), mean time since HCV diagnosis was 9.5 versus 14.6 years (p=0.558) both groups shared a male predominance and HCV acquisition due to intravenous drug use. Regarding genotype characterization, the predominant was 1a in both groups (p<0.01). Evaluation of IL28B polymorphism revealed CC 15.5% (A) versus 9.45% (B) (p<0.01). Group B mean TCD4 count was 585 cells/µL (mean percentage 27.1%). There was spontaneous viral clearance in 10.7% (A) versus 4.1% (B) (p<0.01). There were treated 52.0% (A) versus 32.2% (B) patients (p<0.01). For the untreated ones (107 – group A vs 270 – group B), no reason was identified for treatment deferral in 32.5% (A) versus 48.0% (B) patients. The most frequent reasons for deferring treatment were: withdrawal to follow-up (33.7%), active staging of disease (7.2%), alcohol abuse (6.0%) and advanced age (6.0%) in group A versus low TCD4 cell count (17.1%), loss to follow-up (7.5%), poor adherence (7.5%) and alcohol abuse (3.2%) in group B.
