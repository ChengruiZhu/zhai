 hybridization (ISH) and multispectral imaging microscopy (MSI) were introduced to quantitate miR-92a expression on the microscopic level. ISH of miR-92a was first performed on 34 tissue samples of CA and adenomas with high-grade and low-grade intraepithelial neoplasms, while 31 paralesional normal tissue samples were defined as the control. Subsequently, a MSI technique was applied to quantitate the hybridization signal in terms of optical density (OD) at the visible wavelength. A t-test with unequal variance was used to examine the statistical significance between the groups. Despite all 34 tissue sections demonstrating at least partial positivity of miR-92a expression following ISH, visual grading was inconclusive. As such, the signal of ISH was transformed in terms of OD and further analyzed by employing the MSI system. A statistically significant difference was observed between the expression levels of miR-92a in CA and the paralesional normal controls. By contrast, a poor correlation was revealed between visual and spectral grading. The co-utilization of ISH and MSI generated a legible observation in the expression level of miR-92a, revealing the dynamic change in miR-92a expression in the progression of the disease and providing important information for further functional investigation.
