High-throughput techniques have generated vast amounts of diverse omics and phenotypic data. However, these sets of data have not yet been fully explored to improve the effectiveness and efficiency of drug discovery, a process which has traditionally adopted a one-drug-one-gene paradigm. Consequently, the cost of bringing a drug to market is astounding and the failure rate is daunting. The failure of the target-based drug discovery is in large part due to the fact that a drug rarely interacts only with its intended receptor, but also generally binds to other receptors. To rationally design potent and safe therapeutics, we need to identify all the possible cellular proteins interacting with a drug in an organism. Existing experimental techniques are not sufficient to address this problem, and will benefit from computational modeling. However, it is a daunting task to reliably screen millions of chemicals against hundreds of thousands of proteins. Here, we introduce a fast and accurate method REMAP for large-scale predictions of drug-target interactions. REMAP outperforms state-of-the-art algorithms in terms of both speed and accuracy, and has been successfully applied to drug repurposing. Thus, REMAP may have broad applications in drug discovery.
