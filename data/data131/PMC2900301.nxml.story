DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) can occur spontaneously in cells by defective DNA replication or are induced by various types of DNA damaging agents, such as those used in chemo- or radiation therapy. Failure to repair DSBs, or inappropriate repair, can result in chromosome loss or chromosome rearrangements, events associated with development of cancer cells. Typically, DNA DSBs have two ends that are reunited faithfully by copying from a homologous donor chromosome. For DSBs that present only one end, repair occurs by invasion into a homologous sequence followed by replication to the end of the chromosome, a process called break-induced replication (BIR). This repair pathway is thought to be suppressed at two-ended DSBs to prevent extensive loss of heterozygosity. Here, we describe a new assay to physically monitor BIR to see how this repair pathway differs from the repair of two-ended DSBs. We show this pathway is infrequent, but can be detected by eliminating factors (Exo1 and Sgs1) that degrade linear DNA. However, increased chromosome rearrangements were found in the resection-defective strain. We found the kinetics of strand invasion in two-ended and one-ended DSB repair were the same, suggesting that the distinction between these pathways occurs after initial repair steps have begun.
