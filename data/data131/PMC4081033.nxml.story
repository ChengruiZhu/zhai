The DNA molecule of a human or mouse can be up to two meters long, if stretched. However, it is stored inside the small volume of the nucleus in the living cell. DNA compaction is achieved at different hierarchical levels with the help of a number of architectural proteins. The elementary unit of compaction is the nucleosome, where DNA is wrapped around the protein octamer core. Each nucleosome contains about 147 DNA base pairs; the length of DNA between the neighboring nucleosomes varies from nearly zero to several hundred of base pairs. This variability determines the biological function of the underlying DNA, since some parts of the genome are less compact, and thus potentially actively transcribed, while others are more compact, and their transcription is limited. The DNA distances between neighboring nucleosomes depend on the interaction with many chromatin-associated proteins. The average distance between two neighboring nucleosomes change for different genomic locations and even for the same genomic region in different cell states of the same organism. Here we study these effects and provide their quantitative biophysical description using available experimental data in a number of organisms, ranging from yeast to frog to mouse.
