Cell cycle—the process in which a parent cell replicates its DNA and divides into two daughter cells—is an upregulated process in many forms of cancer. Identifying gene inhibition targets to regulate cell cycle is important to the development of effective therapies. Although modern high throughput techniques offer unprecedented resolution of the molecular details of biological processes like cell cycle, analyzing the vast quantities of the resulting experimental data and extracting actionable information remains a formidable task. Here, we create a dynamical model of the process of cell cycle using the Hopfield model (a type of recurrent neural network) and gene expression data from human cervical cancer cells and yeast cells. We find that the model recreates the oscillations observed in experimental data. Tuning the level of noise (representing the inherent randomness in gene expression and regulation) to the “edge of chaos” is crucial for the proper behavior of the system. We then use this model to identify potential gene targets for disrupting the process of cell cycle. This method could be applied to other time series data sets and used to predict the effects of untested targeted perturbations.
