The purpose of this study was to determine the length of the semitendinosus muscle belly and its tendon in South Indian population and to study the topography and diameter of its neurovascular pedicles. The study included 46 formalin fixed human cadaveric lower limbs. The length of the semitendinosus muscle belly and its tendon were measured. The neurovascular pedicles of the semitendinosus muscle were identified and counted. The diameter of the neurovascular pedicle was measured just before its entrance into the semitendinosus muscle. The topographical distance of the neurovascular pedicles from the origin of the semitendinosus muscle were determined. The mean length of the semitendinosus muscle belly was 332.3±36.1 mm and its tendon measured 154.8±31.9 mm. The mean diameter of the vascular pedicle was measuring 11.4±9.1 mm, just before its entrance into the semitendinosus muscle. The neurovascular pedicles, of the semitendinosus muscle were ranging between 1 and 7. The distance of the entrance of neurovascular pedicle to the semitendinosus muscle from its origin was ranging between 46 and 272 mm. It was observed that the neurovascular pedicles were highest (31%) at the range of 151–200 mm away from the ischial tuberosity. The morphometric data obtained in the present study is enlightening to the orthopedic and plastic surgeons. The topographical knowledge of the neurovascular pedicles has its implications during the harvesting of the grafts and pedicle flaps. The diameter of vessels in the pedicles is enlightening because of new method of anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction.
