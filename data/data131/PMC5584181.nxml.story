Although there are reports of miR-125b being dysregulated in colorectal cancer (CRC) and associated with CRC progression, little is known about its intrinsic regulatory mechanisms. Here we detected the expression of miR-125b in CRC tissues, subsequently investigated the effect of miR-125b on the proliferation, apoptosis, cell cycle and metastasis on CRC cells. Our results showed that the expression of miR-125b was significantly decreased in CRC tissues comparing to adjacent tissues. However, with the stimulation of Granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF), which was highly expressed in CRC tissues, the expression of miR-125b could be improved. Analysis of patient samples revealed that miR-125b presented a clear association with poor differentiation, positive lymph node metastasis, and advanced TNM stage. Overexpression of miR-125b inhibited cell proliferation, triggered G2/M cell cycle arrest, induced subsequent apoptosis, and promoted cell migration and invasion. Moreover, luciferase reporter assays and western blot clarified that the myeloid cell leukemia 1 (MCL1) was a direct target of miR-125b. Thus overexpression of MCL1 attenuated the pro-metastasis function of miR-125b in CRC cell lines. In addition, the protein expression level of MCL1 was decreased in CRC tissues from patients with positive lymph node metastasis, which had high miR-125b expression. Collectively, our study suggested that miR-125b induced by G-CSF plays a promoting role in the metastasis of CRC by targeting MCL1, which may serve as a novel therapeutic target for CRC metastasis.
