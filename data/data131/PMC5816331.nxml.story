The pathogenesis, diagnosis and therapy of sarcoidosis as an autonomous disease are subjects of spirited discussions, which haven’t found definitive conclusion yet. Distinguishing between sarcoidosis and sarcoid-like reactions (sarcoid - type granulomas) is not currently a medical “gold standard” and is not implemented in clinical practice. This leads to 1) misinterpretation of numerous available data; 2) difficulty in the interpretation of other unverified data, which is often followed by 3) inappropriate or inadequate therapeutic approach. Similarly to many other diseases, in sarcoidosis and sarcoid - types of reactions the concept of personalised approach and therapy should also be introduced. This methodology of clinical guidance is difficult, complex and not always achievable in the current medical status and relations (doctor-patient relationship; financial factor; time factor). It is appropriate to note that in some cases the guidelines or the so-called standards are neglected or not possible to put into practice with the aim of better therapeutic practices and strategies, as well as the achievement of optimal final clinical results (especially in patients with sarcoid granulomas). The sarcoid granuloma, even when it is sterile, should not be considered as the equivalent of sarcoidosis, i.e., sarcoidosis as an autonomous disease. Sure enough, exactly because of this fact, the personalised approach should not be an exception, but it has to gradually become a rule in medical practice. When clinical decisions are conformed to some of the latest modern concepts, officialised in the international databases, often the achieved results can be much better.
