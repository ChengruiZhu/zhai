The aim of this study was to describe a young man with probably the largest pheochromocytoma associated with MEN 2A, described till date. The patient, a non-vegetarian, fifth of eight siblings, married, having five children, presented with episodes of difficult-to-control hypertension requiring over five antihypertensives. He was referred to us with an abdominal CT scan that revealed a 16 cm left-sided adrenal mass. Biochemical testing confirmed a catecholamine secreting pathology. Histopathology confirmed the mass as a pheochromocytoma weighing 1.8 kg. Further evaluation suggested a parathormone-dependent hypercalcemia and a left-sided thyroid mass. Histopathology confirmed parathyroid hyperplasia and medullary carcinoma of the thyroid mixed with papillary carcinoma of thyroid. Putting all the findings together showed that the patient was suffering from multiple endocrine neoplasia 2. Multiple endocrine neoplasia 2A is a rare syndrome. The case is unique in the way it presented, with all the three tumors at the same time. The management was bold and addressed all the three lesions in the same hospital admission. We are also reporting the largest described case of pheochromocytoma from India.
