, and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) and serum were collected on day 3. The effects of extended prophylaxis treatment (daily from days −7 to +3 or days −7 to 0) were also compared with those of the shorter treatment regimens (days −1 to +3 or days −1 and 0). Early and late interventions with PC945 (2.8 to 350 μg/mouse; approximately 0.11 to ∼14 mg/kg of body weight) were found to inhibit lung fungal loads and to decrease the concentrations of galactomannan (GM) in both BALF and serum as well as several biomarkers in BALF (interferon gamma [IFN-γ], interleukin-17 [IL-17], and malondialdehyde) and serum (tumor necrosis factor alpha [TNF-α] and IL-6) in a dose-dependent manner and were >3- and >47-fold more potent than intranasally dosed posaconazole and voriconazole, respectively. Furthermore, extended prophylaxis with low-dose PC945 (0.56 μg/mouse; 0.022 mg/kg) was found to inhibit fungal loads and to decrease the concentrations biomarkers more potently than did the shorter treatment regimens. Thus, PC945 dosed intranasally once daily showed potent antifungal effects, and the effects of PC945 accumulated upon repeat dosing and were persistent. Therefore, PC945 has the potential to be a novel inhaled therapy for the treatment of
