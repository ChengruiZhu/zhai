The effects of 4-acetamido-4'-isothiocyanostilbene-2,2'-disulfonic acid (SITS) on the K conductance, gK, were studied in internally perfused giant axons from squid, Doryteuthis. SITS at 3-200 microM was applied intracellularly by adding the reagent to the internal perfusion fluid. Three remarkable changes in gK were noted: there was a slowing of the opening and closing rates of the K channel in the whole voltage region; K channels modified with SITS started to open at voltages below -100 mV, and thus 30% of total K channels were open at the level of normal resting potential (approximately -60 mV) after the maximal drug effect was attained (less than 30 microM); there was a disappearance of gK inactivation that became distinct at relatively high temperature (greater than 8 degrees C). These drug effects depended solely on the drug concentration, not on factors such as repetitive alterations of the membrane potential, and the changes in gK were almost irreversible. Another disulfonic stilbene derivative, 4,4'-diisothiocyanostilbene- 2,2'-disulfonic acid (DIDS), had similar effects on gK, but the effects were approximately 1.5 times stronger. These changes in gK were somewhat similar to alterations in gNa produced by an application of veratridine, batrachotoxin, and grayanotoxin, which are known as Na channel openers.
