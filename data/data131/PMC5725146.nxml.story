Head and neck squamous cell carcinomas (HNSCC) are a heterogeneous group of tumours that originate predominantly from the oral cavity, pharynx and larynx. Our aim was to determine whether salivary miRNA expression levels can diagnose these cancer subtypes. Saliva samples were collected from healthy controls (n=113, smoker and non-smokers), HPV-positive (n=54) and HPV-negative (n=47) HNSCC patients. The miRNA expression levels in saliva was quantified using qPCR. The potential of salivary miRNAs to discriminate these groups of patients was evaluated using multiple logistic regression with ROC analysis and a 10-fold cross-validation analysis. Salivary miRNA-9, -127, -134, -191, -222 and -455 were shown to discriminate a control group from a HPV-negative HNSCC patient group with a sensitivity of 60% and a specificity of 94%; whilst salivary miRNA-9,-134, -196b, -210, and -455 were the most parsimonious subset discriminating a control group from a HPV-positive HNSCC group, with a sensitivity of 65% and a specificity of 95%. Furthermore, miRNA-9, -134, -196b, -210 and -455 as a panel, was the most parsimonious subset to discriminate HPV-positive HNSCC patients from HPV-negative HNSCC patients. In addition, the expression levels of miRNA-9, -127, -196a, -196b, -210, -222 and -455 were significantly increased in the saliva collected from early stage HNSCC patients compared to controls. A future multi-centre confirmatory study is warranted to test the diagnostic performance of these salivary miRNA prior to clinical implementation.
