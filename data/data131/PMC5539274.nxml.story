Protrusion of scaffold struts is related with local coronary flow dynamics that can promote scaffold restenosis and thrombosis. That fact has prompted us to investigate in vivo the protrusion status of different types of scaffolds and their relationship with endothelial shear stress (ESS) distributions. Six Absorb everolimus-eluting Bioresorbable Vascular Scaffolds (Absorb, Abbott Vascular) and 11 Mirage sirolimus-eluting Bioresorbable Microfiber Scaffolds (Mirage, Manli Cardiology) were implanted in coronaries of eight mini pigs. Optical coherence tomography (OCT) was performed post-scaffold implantation and obtained images were fused with angiographic data to reconstruct the three dimensional coronary anatomy. Blood flow simulation was performed and ESS distribution was estimated for each scaffold. Protrusion distance was estimated using a dedicated software. Correlation between OCT-derived protrusion and ESS distribution was assessed for both scaffold groups. A significant difference was observed in the protrusion distances (156 ± 137 µm for Absorb, 139 ± 153 µm for Mirage; p = 0.035), whereas difference remained after adjusting the protrusion distances according to the luminal areas. Strut protrusion of Absorb is inversely correlated with ESS (r = −0.369, p < 0.0001), whereas in Mirage protrusion was positively correlated with EES (r = 0.192, p < 0.0001). Protrusion distance was higher in Absorb than in Mirage. The protrusion of the thick quadratic struts of Absorb has a tendency to lower shear stress in the close vicinity of struts. However, circular shape of the less thick struts of Mirage didn’t show this trend in creating zone of recirculation around the struts. Strut geometry has different effect on the relationship between protrusion and shear stress in Absorb and Mirage scaffolds.
