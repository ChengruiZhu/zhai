 eggs. Nuclei assembled or placed in these extracts undergo the morphological changes typical of apoptosis and eventually disintegrate. We used this system to investigate the potential involvement in apoptosis of proteins containing Src homology 2 (SH2) domains, which are known to interact with specific tyrosine-phosphorylated ligands. SH2 domains from a number of signaling proteins, including Lck, Src, and Abl, inhibited apoptosis when present at concentrations of 10–100 nM. The inhibition was dependent on specific interaction with endogenous tyrosine-phosphorylated ligands. A synthetic peptide ligand for Src family SH2 domains also inhibited apoptosis in a phosphotyrosine-dependent manner. Kinetic analysis defined three phases in the apoptotic process occurring in this cell-free system. SH2 domains and ceramide act throughout the first 60–90 min of the process (the “initiation” phase). Next, Bcl-2, interleukin-1β converting enzyme family(CPP32-like) proteases, and the heavy membrane fraction act in a period occurring ∼90–120 min after the start of incubation (the “sentencing” phase). In the final phase (“execution”), the process of active nuclear destruction ensues.
