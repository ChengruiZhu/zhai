In this study, we evaluate the attenuation of the dose due to barium‐impregnation in the region between the surface of an electronic brachytherapy (EBT) balloon applicator for accelerated partial breast irradiation (APBI) and the prescription point at 1 cm depth in tissue. To perform the study, depth dose curves were calculated using a general purpose multi‐particle transport code (FLUKA) for a range of balloon wall thicknesses with and without barium impregnation. Numerical data were verified with experimental readings using a parallel plate extrapolation ionization chamber for different wall thicknesses. Depth dose curves computed using both numerical and experimental methods show a 6.0% attenuation of the dose at the 1.0 cm prescription line due to the impregnation of barium in the balloon material, which agrees well with the manufacturer's specification. By applying this single attenuation factor, dose calculations throughout the entire planned volume are uniformly affected. However, at the balloon surface, attenuation on the order of 18.0% is observed. The AAPM TG‐43 source data currently incorporated in commercially‐available treatment planning systems do not account for the variable dose distributions attributable to balloon wall attenuation. Our results show that variable attenuation factors that may have clinical significance should be applied in order to determine near‐surface dose distributions when using barium impregnated balloons for intracavitary breast brachytherapy. Dose distributions at distances greater than 1 cm from the surface of the balloon appear to be accurately represented without further modification.
