Proteases modify the structure and activity of all proteins by peptide bond hydrolysis and are increasingly recognized as integral regulatory components of numerous biological mechanisms. Deregulated protease activity is a common characteristic of many diseases. However, protease drug development is complicated by an incomplete understanding of protease biology. One missing piece in this puzzle is the interplay between proteases: Some proteases activate other proteases, whereas some proteases inactivate inhibitors, leading to currently unpredictable cleavage of additional proteins. Using database annotations we mathematically modeled protease interactions. Our model includes 1,230 proteins and shows connections between 141,523 pairs of proteases, substrates, and inhibitors. Thus, proteases interact on a large scale to form the protease web, which links most studied groups of proteases and their inhibitors, indicating that the potential of regulation through this network is very large. We found that this interplay is robust to targeted or untargeted pruning of the protease web and that protease inhibitors are central to network connectivity. Our model was used to decipher proteolytic pathways that drive inflammatory processes
