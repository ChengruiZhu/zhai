Gene expression is a fundamental cellular process that translates the information stored in the DNA into proteins, the workhorses of the cell. Eukaryotic cells contain a nucleus, where the genetic information is stored and transcribed by RNA polymerase II into messenger (m)RNAs. These copies of the blueprint of life need to be exported to the cytoplasm for protein production. Interestingly, mRNA synthesis is coupled to nuclear mRNA export. The protein complex TREX mediates this coupling of transcription to mRNA export. To assess the recruitment mechanism of TREX to genes we analyzed the presence of TREX over the whole genome in budding yeast. We found that there is more TREX at the end than at the beginning of genes. TREX binds to a subunit of RNA polymerase II, phosphorylation of which increases over the gene mediating the increase in TREX. Importantly, this increase in TREX over genes is important for normal levels of long transcripts. Thus, we show for the first time that a gradual increase of a protein complex is important for correct expression of the genome. We propose that TREX functions to keep the mRNA in the vicinity of the transcription machinery for correct processing and mRNP formation.
