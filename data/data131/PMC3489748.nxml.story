Aging entails the accumulation of neoantigens comprised of aggregated, oxidized, mutated and misfolded biomolecules, including advanced-glycation end projects (AGEs). There is evidence that the immune system can recognize and clear cells fouled by these molecular debris, which contribute to the emergence of cancer and other major age-associated diseases such as atherogenic and neurodegenerative disorders. However, this process may become increasingly inefficient with aging, perhaps in part because of an insufficiency of adjuvant signals normally associated with infection that can program productive inflammatory states and properly orient the immune system toward regenerative healing. Here we propose conceptual foundations for exploring a small set of infection-associated molecules as potential immune adjuvants to reprogram non-productive inflammatory states in aging tissues, and to improve the clearance of cellular pathologies that engender age-associated disease. The proposed adjuvant classes include a subset of D-amino acids used by bacteria to disrupt biofilms; nucleoside derivatives of N6-methyladenine, which functions at the core of bacterial dam restriction systems; and derivatives of the galactosyl trisaccharide Î±-Gal, which invokes the hyperacute response in primates. These foreign amino acids, nucleosides and sugar molecules are generally rare or absent in humans, except in association with infections by bacteria, protists or nematodes. A rationale for exploration of these candidate adjuvant principles and their chemical derivatives is discussed in terms of their use in generalized strategies to improve the prevention or treatment of cancer and other age-associated diseases, as negative modifiers of aging.
