Genetic programs in multicellular organisms often involve different levels of regulation. The expression of many genes is regulated by factors that remodel the structure of the chromatin at the promoter. SWI/SNF is one such factor, and it is highly conserved in eukaryotes. Studies in human cells suggest that Brahma, the catalytic subunit of SWI/SNF, regulates the processing of precursor mRNAs (pre-mRNAs). We have studied Brahma in two insect model systems to further elucidate the mechanisms by which SWI/SNF regulates gene expression. We show that depletion of SWI/SNF subunits changes the relative abundances of alternative transcripts from a subset of pre-mRNAs that code for proteins that regulate the postembryonic development of the flies. We also show that a fraction of Brahma is not associated with chromatin but with nascent pre-mRNPs—both in insects and mammals—which suggests that SWI/SNF acts at the RNA level to regulate pre-mRNA processing. These findings illustrate the dual role of a chromatin remodelling factor; SWI/SNF acts both at the transcriptional level and post-transcriptionally to regulate not only the amount of mRNA synthesized from a given promoter but also the type of alternative transcript produced.
