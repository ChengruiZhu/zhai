Sub- and ultraharmonics generation by ultrasound contrast agents makes possible sub- and ultraharmonics imaging to enhance the contrast of ultrasound images and overcome the limitations of harmonic imaging. In order to separate different frequency components of ultrasound contrast agents signals, nonlinear models like single-input single-output (SISO) Volterra model are used. One important limitation of this model is its incapacity to model sub- and ultraharmonic components. Many attempts are made to model sub- and ultraharmonics using Volterra model. It led to the design of mutiple-input singe-output (MISO) Volterra model instead of SISO Volterra model. The key idea of MISO modeling was to decompose the input signal of the nonlinear system into periodic subsignals at the subharmonic frequency. In this paper, sub- and ultraharmonics modeling with MISO Volterra model is presented in a general framework that details and explains the required conditions to optimally model sub- and ultraharmonics. A new decomposition of the input signal in periodic orthogonal basis functions is presented. Results of application of different MISO Volterra methods to model simulated ultrasound contrast agents signals show its efficiency in sub- and ultraharmonics imaging.
