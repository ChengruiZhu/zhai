The processes of neurogenesis and neuronal migration within the developing cerebral cortex must be tightly orchestrated to enable ordered generation and transportation of neurons to designated cortical layers. The mechanism by which these two processes are integrated remains elusive. Radial glial cells, the major neural stem cells in the developing brain, serve both as progenitors and migration scaffolds for cortical neurons as they migrate. The cortical developmental disease lissencephaly (smooth brain) is a result of defects in neurogenesis and neuronal migration, and is associated with the protein LIS1 and its binding partner NDE1. In this study, we show that several key players in human cerebral cortical development, including LIS1, NDE1, dystrophin, and dystroglycan, form a molecular complex to regulate cortical neurogenesis and neuronal migration in a mouse model. This multi-protein complex is active on the basal-lateral surface of radial glial cells, which is known to provide guidance to migrating neurons. When we depleted NDE1 in mice, dystrophin and dystroglycan were lost from the membrane and radial glial cells were deformed, indicating the importance of the multi-protein complex for proper cell morphology. This effect on morphology resulted in a loss of normal migration and cortical phenotypes similar to lissencephaly. Our findings suggest that genes that regulate the structure and function of the basal-lateral membrane of radial glial cells may integrate the dual functions of these cells and determine the size, shape, and function of the cerebral cortex.
