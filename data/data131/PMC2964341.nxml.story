Ribosomes are molecular machines that synthesize proteins and are found in every cell. Each ribosome has a small and a large subunit, each of which is in turn composed of ribosomal RNA and many ribosomal proteins. In eukaryotic cells, the generation of these ribosomal subunits is a complex process requiring the participation of hundreds of factors. Originating from the nucleolus (a nuclear region specialized in ribosome synthesis) immature ribosomal subunits pass through the nuclear interior and are exported to the cytoplasm, where their assembly is finalized. In recent years, it has become apparent that defects in ribosome production are associated with human diseases, but our knowledge about this fundamental process is largely based on knowledge derived from yeast, a unicellular eukaryote. We set out to systematically identify factors involved in making ribosomes in human cells by individually depleting around 500 different cellular proteins. Using microscopic analysis, we identified approximately 150 human ribosome synthesis factors, thereby significantly extending our knowledge about human ribosome biogenesis. Our dataset not only revealed many evolutionarily conserved aspects of this essential cellular process but also led us to characterize an export route for the large ribosomal subunit that is specific for higher eukaryotic cells.
