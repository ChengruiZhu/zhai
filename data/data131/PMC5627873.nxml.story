. However, the effect of PSO on chondrocyte proliferation and the precise mechanisms involved remain to be elucidated. We investigated the effects of PSO on chondrocytes isolated from Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats and evaluated involvement of the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway. The viability of chondrocytes treated with PSO was increased in a dose- and time-dependent manner, as assessed by MTT assay. We found that the gene expression and protein levels of Wnt-4, Frizzled-2, β-catenin and cyclin D1 in the PSO-treated chondrocytes were significantly upregulated, while the gene expression and protein level of glycogen synthase kinase-3β (GSK-3β) were downregulated, compared with the untreated chondrocytes. By immunofluorescence, we also found that PSO induced β-catenin nuclear translocation. Importantly, the expression of β-catenin and cyclin D1 was partly inhibited by Dickkopf-1 (DKK-1), an inhibitor of the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway. Additionally, Col-II expression in chondrocytes was increased after treatment with PSO. Taken together, these results indicate that PSO promotes chondrocyte proliferation by activating the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway, and it may play an important role in the treatment of OA.
