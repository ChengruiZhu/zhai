The current study investigated the molecular mechanisms underlying pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and screened for small molecular drugs as supplementary drugs to aid current therapy. Gene expression data of Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) DataSet GSE42221, which consists of 7 primary human B-precursor samples and 4 control B-cell progenitor lymphoblast samples from patients with pediatric ALL, were downloaded from the public GEO database. Linear Models for Microarray Analysis package for R statistical software was used to identify differentially expressed genes (DEGs). Subsequently, biclustering analysis of DEGs was performed using pheatmap package for R. Functional enrichment analysis of DEGs was conducted using the Database for Annotation, Visualization and Integrated Discovery tool. Additionally, Search Tool for the Retrieval of Interacting Genes software was used to screen protein-protein interactions (PPIs) of the DEGs, and Connectivity Map database was employed to obtain small-molecule drugs that were significantly associated with DEGs. In total, 116 genes were identified as DEGs in pediatric ALL, including 56 downregulated and 60 upregulated genes. Functional enrichment analysis identified that upregulated DEGs, including
