 antiproliferative activity of the cardiac glycosides (CGs) digitoxin and its synthetic analog MonoD on H460 lung cancer cells grown under different culture conditions. The CGs were tested alone in H460 cells under routine culture as well as in cells growing under short (24â€“72 h) and prolonged serum starvation (7 days) in order to evaluate the activity of drugs on cancer cells under varied degrees of proliferation. Our results showed that both CGs, and MonoD in particular, have potent antiproliferative activity at clinically relevant concentrations against cells in all the tested culture conditions. In contrast, paclitaxel, hydroxyurea and colchicine were only active in cells growing in routine culture conditions, and relatively inactive in serum-starved conditions. Importantly, both CGs were able to potentiate the effect of clinically relevant concentrations of hydroxyurea or paclitaxel in serum-starved conditions. When paclitaxel was used in combination with CGs, the highest antiproliferative effect was obtained when paclitaxel was administered first, followed by either digitoxin or MonoD. Our results indicate that CGs have potential clinical applications in translational oncology especially in combination with other drugs, and warrants further investigation of CGs in more advanced preclinical models of lung cancer.
