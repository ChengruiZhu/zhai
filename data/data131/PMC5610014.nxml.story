NR6A1/CT150, as an orphan receptor, is a novel member of the cancer-testis (CT) antigen family. Here, we investigated the expression and function of NR6A1 and its underlying mechanisms in prostate cancer (PCa) patients who underwent radical prostatectomy. A total of 303 cases of prostate cancer after radical prostatectomy were analysed in a tissue microarray (TMA) for NR6A1 immunohistochemistry-based protein expression. Kaplanâ€“Meier/log-rank analysis and Cox regression analysis were used to investigate the relationship between NR6A1 expression and clinicopathological factors in PCa. NR6A1 mRNA expression was examined by reversing transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Knockdown of NR6A1 by small interfering RNA mediated gene silencing and overexpression of NR6A1 through lentivirus were utilized to investigate its potential role in prostate cancer cells. NR6A1 protein expression was 29.7% (90/303) and mRNA expression was 28.1%(9/32) in PCa patients. NR6A1 expression was significantly associated with Gleason score (GS) (P=0.003) and tumor stage (P=0.042). The patients with positive NR6A1 expression have a shorter biochemical recurrence-free survival. NR6A1 predicted biochemical recurrence in univariate (P=0.0159) and multivariate models (P=0.0317). In addition, gene silencing of NR6A1 resulted in G0/G1 phase cell cycle arrest, and decreased metastatic and invasive potential of prostate cancer cells DU145 and PC3. In contrast, overexpression of NR6A1 reduced G0/G1 phase cell cycle arrest, and promoted metastatic and invasive potential of prostate cancer cells 22RV1. And overexpression of NR6A1 significantly promoted tumor growth
