Accelerated cognitive decline in Alzheimer's patients is associated with accumulation of choline-containing lipids. One of these lipids, C16:0 platelet activating factor (PAF), is specifically elevated in brains of Alzheimer's patients. As elevated exposure to C16:0 PAF ultimately leads to neuronal death, it is crucial to identify underlying mechanisms that mitigate the toxic effects of this lipid. In this study we exploit the conserved biology between humans and baker's yeast to identify key genes that are essential to buffer the toxic effects of C16:0 PAF. We found that Srf1, or Spo14 Regulatory Factor 1, the previously uncharacterized protein Ydl133w, is essential for mitigating the toxic effects of C16:0 PAF in yeast. We determine that Srf1 interacts with yeast phospholipase D (PLD) Spo14 and is required for PLD activity in mitotic cells. Hence we discovered a novel regulator of PLD in yeast. Further, we extend our studies to higher eukaryotes demonstrating that PLD is required to buffer the neurotoxic effect of C16:0 PAF. Our study suggests that therapeutic strategies modulating PLD activity may be effective in ameliorating Alzheimer's Disease pathology associated with disruptions in lipid metabolism.
