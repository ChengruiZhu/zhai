Acute salpingitis (AS) is an inflammatory disease which causes severe damage to a subset of classically described cells lining in oviduct wall and contributes to interstitial fibrosis and fertility problems. Telocytes (TCs), a newly discovered peculiar type of stromal cells, have been identified in many organs, including oviduct, with proposed multiple potential bio-functions. However, with recent increasing reports regarding TCs alterations in disease-affected tissues, there is still lack of evidence about TCs involvement in AS-affected oviduct tissues and potential pathophysiological roles. We presently identified normal TCs by their characteristic ultrastructural features and immunophenotype. However, in AS-affected oviduct tissues, TCs displayed multiple ultrastructural damage both in cellular body and prolongations, with obvious loss of TCs and development of tissue fibrosis. Furthermore, TCs lose their interstitial 3-D network connected by homocellular or heterocellular junctions between TCs and adjacent cells. And especially, TCs connected to the activated immunocytes (mononuclear cells, eosinophils) and affected local immune state (repression or activation). Meanwhile, massive neutrophils infiltration and overproduced Inducible Nitric Oxide Synthase (iNOS), COX-2, suggested mechanism of inflammatory-induced TCs damage. Consequently, TCs damage might contribute to AS-induced structural and reproductive functional abnormalities of oviduct, probably
