The molecular mechanisms that generate biodiversity remain largely elusive. We examined how two of these mechanisms, changes in gene expression and changes in gene coding sequence, have generated an incredibly diverse set of visual systems in rapidly speciating African cichlids. We found large differences in cone opsin gene expression among cichlids inhabiting the clear waters of Lake Malawi. These changes are likely to have strong influences on retinal sensitivity and appear to be driven primarily by different foraging needs. Cichlids inhabiting the turbid waters of Lake Victoria, however, only expressed a subset of their opsin genes and variation in gene expression appears to by driven primarily by the spectrum of environmental light. When we compared the sequences of these opsin genes, we found greater variation in the genes at the ultraviolet and red edges of the sensitivity range. Taken together these findings suggest that changes in gene expression and coding sequence can be complementary and work in concert to generate changes in sensory systems. Because of their correlation with ecological factors, these changes are also likely to be adaptive and to have played a role in generating the tremendous diversity of cichlids in these two lakes.
