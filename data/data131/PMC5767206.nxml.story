Recurrent furunculosis is an infection of hair follicles which results in formation of abscesses. Previous studies showed that the pathogenesis of the disease may include an immune-mediated component as the proliferative response of peripheral blood lymphocytes to staphylococcal antigen is depressed. The aim of our study was to evaluate cytokines concentration in the plasma of patients with recurrent furunculosis and to determine whether retinol affects the secretion of those cytokines in patients with recurrent furunculosis and healthy subjects. Blood samples were taken from 15 patients with recurrent furunculosis and 15 age-matched healthy subjects. A quantitative determination of selected cytokines (IL-17, 13, 2, 10, 4, IFN-γ, TNF-α) was performed in the plasma at baseline and after 72-h culture of peripheral blood mononuclear cells with and without retinol in both groups. In the plasma of patients with recurrent furunculosis, concentration of IL-10, 2, and TNF-α was significantly higher, whereas IL-13 significantly lower when compared with healthy subjects. After retinol stimulation, the concentration of IL-17 and IFN-γ increased significantly in both groups. Secretion of anti-inflammatory cytokines, especially IL-10 (
