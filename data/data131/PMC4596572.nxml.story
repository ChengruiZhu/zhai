ASCT2 is a membrane protein that imports neutral amino acids into cells in exchange for intracellular amino acids. ASCT2 is highly expressed in peripheral tissues such as the lung, where it contributes to the homeostasis of intracellular concentrations of neutral amino acids. Recently, ASCT2 has been shown to be important for nutrient uptake in reprogrammed cancer networks. Here, we use an innovative computational approach that includes homology modeling and ligand docking to model the structure of this transporter in two distinct conformations, and virtually screen large compound libraries against these models. We use a variety of experimental assays and functional measurements to confirm seven new ligands for this transporter, including five activators and two inhibitors. This combined approach reveals specificity determinants for ligand-binding and transport, including previously unknown pockets to be targeted via structure-based drug design. The results improve our understanding of how substrate specificity is determined in amino acid transporters and provide a framework for developing potent chemical tools and potential drugs targeting ASCT2, an emerging therapeutic target for cancer and neurological disorders.
