 organisms per cc., the initial rate at which the spirochetes were killed was not affected by their number. Consistent with that observation, no demonstrable penicillin was bound or inactivated by thick suspensions. The amount of penicillin required to sterilize suspensions of varying density nevertheless varied to a large extent with the initial number of organisms. This was only in part due to the progressive deterioration of the penicillin with prolonged incubation; and the persistence of organisms resistant to the drug, and perhaps an adaptative change after prolonged exposure to penicillin, may be contributing factors. 3. The organisms remained actively motile for a period of 8 to 24 hours after they had been rendered non-viable by the action of penicillin. Even 500 units of penicillin per cc., or approximately 10,000 times an effectively spirocheticidal concentration, did not accelerate that delayed immobilization. It follows that, although penicillin rapidly renders the organisms non-viable, the metabolic system affected is not immediately essential to the life of the cell, and the motility and presumably other vital functions remain unaffected for a significant number of hours. 4. The rate at which the organisms were killed by penicillin increased with temperature in the range 8–40°C. With an original inoculum of 10
