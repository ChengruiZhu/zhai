IgA nephropathy(IgAN) is the most common primary glomerular disease in China. Primary infections always occur before IgAN. However, the pathology of IgAN is still unclear. Previously we found that LL37, a protein secreted by senescent cells, was specific for the progression of IgAN, and also played a role in the neutrophil function. So we hypothesized that the infiltration of neutrophils, inflammation factors, and aging markers, which were modulated by functional networks, induced the immune response and renal injury. RNA-Sequencing (RNA-seq) can be used to study the whole transcriptome and detect splicing variants that are expressed in a specific cell type or tissue. We separate glomerulus from the renal biopsy tissues. After RNA extraction, the sequences were analyzed with Illumina HiSeq 2000/2500. 381 genes with differential expression between the IgAN patients and the healthy controls were identified. Only PLAU, JUN, and FOS were related to DNA damage, telomere dysfunction-induced aging markers, neutrophil function and IgA nephropathy. The networks showed the possibility of these genes being connected. We conclude that DNA damage and telomere dysfunction could play important roles in IgA nephropathy. In addition, neutrophils are also important factors in this disease. The networks of these markers showed the mechanism pathways that are involved in the duration of the occurrence and progression of IgA nephropathy and might be a new therapeutic opportunity for disease treatment.
