CC‐292, a potent Bruton tyrosine kinase inhibitor, is under development for the treatment of B‐cell malignancies. An analysis was performed to develop a population pharmacokinetic model of CC‐292 and assess the influence of demographics and disease‐related covariates on CC‐292 exposure and to assess the exposure‐response (overall response rate) relationship in patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia. Population pharmacokinetic analysis was based on a 2‐compartment base model conducted in NONMEM. Categorical exposure‐response analysis was performed using logistic regression in SAS. The population pharmacokinetic analysis results indicated that CC‐292 pharmacokinetic disposition is similar between healthy subjects and patients. CC‐292 showed a larger central compartment volume of distribution than the peripheral compartment volume of distribution (158 L and 72 L, respectively) and a faster clearance than intercompartmental clearance (134 L/h and 18.7 L/h, respectively), indicating that for CC‐292, clearance from blood occurs faster than distribution into deep tissues and organs. CC‐292 clearance is not affected by demographics or baseline clinical lab factors, except for sex. Although sex significantly reduced variation of apparent clearance, the sex effect on apparent clearance is unlikely to be clinically relevant. The exposure‐response analysis suggested that higher drug exposure is linearly correlated with higher overall response rate. A twice‐daily dose regimen showed higher overall response rate as compared to once‐daily dosing, consistent with a threshold concentration of approximately 300 ng/mL, above which the probability of overall response rate significantly increases.
