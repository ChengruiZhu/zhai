This retrospective study was performed to analyze the long-term outcome of topical corticosteroid treatment for severe dry eye associated with Sjögren's syndrome (SS). Patients who had severe dry eye associated with SS were topically treated with loteprednol etabonate 0.5% (group A, n=66) or fluorometholone 0.1% (group B, n=67) twice daily and were followed up for 2 years. Visual acuity (VA), intraocular pressure (IOP), Schirmer test, tear film breakup time (BUT), keratoepitheliopathy, and symptom scores were measured at baseline and 6, 12, 18, and 24 months after treatment. VA and IOP were not changed significantly during follow-up in either group. Schirmer test results, keratoepitheliopathy, and symptom scores at 6, 12, 18, and 24 months (p<0.05) and tear film BUT at 12, 18, and 24 months (p<0.05) significantly improved after treatment compared with baseline in both groups. No significant differences between the groups were found in any parameter during follow-up. At 24 months, the number of patients with IOP elevation of more than 2 mmHg compared with baseline was 4 in group A (6.1%) and 9 in group B (13.4%). The mean IOP in these patients was lower in group A than in group B (15.00±0.82 mmHg versus 16.50±1.12 mmHg; p=0.04). Long-term application of low-dose topical corticosteroids is effective for controlling signs and symptoms of chronic, severe dry eye associated with SS. Loteprednol etabonate 0.5% may have a lower risk for IOP elevation than fluorometholone 0.1%.
