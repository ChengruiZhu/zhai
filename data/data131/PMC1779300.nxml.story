When predicting the structure for a protein sequence, a major step is achieved when an evolutionarily related protein with a known structure is identified. This process is called fold recognition, and has been a major force behind improvement in structure prediction. Moreover, fold-recognition techniques have become increasingly important in recent years because of the huge numbers of protein sequences with unknown structures available through sequencing projects on completed genomes. However, all fold-recognition methods tend to produce either a large number of false negatives (at high confidence scores) or a large number of false positives (at low confidence scores). Here we show that the reliability of a fold-recognition technique can be explored by analysing its predictions across a set of completed genomes. We have developed a method that can indicate false positives in these genome-wide assignment sets. The basic idea behind the method is that a fold assignment on a genome is less reliable if the prediction is not observed on evolutionary related genomes. The ability of the method to discriminate false positives is confirmed by independent tests. The method can be used on the output of any genome-wide fold assignment method.
