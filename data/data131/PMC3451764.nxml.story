The objective of this study is to estimate the prevalence of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) and heartburn in migraine patients and examine their use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) or aspirin-containing medications when treating acute migraine attacks. Responses from a web-based survey of migraine patients were matched to the same patientâ€™s responses on a general health survey. A total of 1,832 migraineurs (92.0%) were successfully matched. A total of 403 migraineurs (22.0%) reported having diagnosed GERD, 212 (11.6%) reported diagnosed heartburn, and 290 (15.8%) reported reflux symptoms but were undiagnosed. The most common prescription drugs used to treat migraines were triptans. First-line NSAID/aspirin medication use was 10.0% among diagnosed GERD and heartburn patients, 17.8% among undiagnosed patients, and 11.8% among GERD/heartburn-free migraineurs. In conclusion, almost half of migraineurs reported physician-diagnosed GERD and heartburn or symptoms of these conditions. Use of NSAID medications for migraine is fairly common among diagnosed GERD patients and more so for those with undiagnosed GERD symptoms. Physicians should minimize prescribing NSAIDs or NSAID-containing acute migraine medications in this population.
