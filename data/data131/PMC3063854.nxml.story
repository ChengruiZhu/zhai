We developed a doxycycline-inducible mouse model, termed DNMP, to inhibit NF-κB activity specifically within the mammary epithelium during tumor development in the polyoma middle T oncogene (PyVT) mouse mammary tumor model. DNMP females and PyVT littermate controls were treated with doxycycline from 4 to 12 weeks of age. We observed an increase in tumor latency and a decrease in final tumor burden in DNMP mice compared to PyVT controls. A similar effect with treatment from 8 to 12 weeks indicates that outcome is independent of effects on postnatal virgin ductal development. In both cases, DNMP mice were less likely to develop lung metastases than controls. Treatment from 8 to 9 weeks was sufficient to impact primary tumor formation. Inhibition of NF-κB increases apoptosis in hyperplastic stages of tumor development and decreases proliferation at least in part by reducing CyclinD1 expression. To test the therapeutic potential of NF-κB inhibition, we generated palpable tumors by orthotopic injection of PyVT cells and then treated systemically with the NF-κB inhibitor thymoquinone (TQ). TQ treatment resulted in a reduction in tumor volume and weight as compared to vehicle-treated control. This data indicates that epithelial NF-κB is an active contributor to tumor progression and demonstrates that inhibition of NF-κB could have a significant therapeutic impact even at later stages of mammary tumor progression.
