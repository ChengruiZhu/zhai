The SEC13 gene of Saccharomyces cerevisiae is required in vesicle biogenesis at a step before or concurrent with the release of transport vesicles from the ER membrane. SEC13 encodes a 33-kD protein with sequence homology to a series of conserved internal repeat motifs found in beta subunits of heterotrimeric G proteins. The product of this gene, Sec13p, is a cytosolic protein peripherally associated with membranes. We developed a cell-free Sec13p-dependent vesicle formation reaction. Sec13p-depleted membranes and cytosol fractions were generated by urea treatment of membranes and affinity depletion of a Sec13p-dihydrofolate reductase fusion protein, respectively. These fractions were unable to support vesicle formation from the ER unless cytosol containing Sec13p was added. Cytosolic Sec13p fractionated by gel filtration as a large complex of about 700 kD. Fractions containing the Sec13p complex restored activity to the Sec13p- dependent vesicle formation reaction. Expression of SEC13 on a multicopy plasmid resulted in overproduction of a monomeric form of Sec13p, suggesting that another member of the complex becomes limiting when Sec13p is overproduced. Overproduced, monomeric Sec13p was inactive in the Sec13p- dependent vesicle formation assay.
