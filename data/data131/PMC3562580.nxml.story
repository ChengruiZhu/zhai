Cushing's Disease is caused by oversecretion of ACTH from a pituitary adenoma and results in subsequent elevations of systemic cortisol, ultimately contributing to reduced patient survival. The diagnosis of Cushing's Disease frequently involves a stepwise approach including clinical, laboratory, neuroimaging, and sometimes interventional radiology techniques, often mandating multidisciplinary collaboration from numerous specialty practitioners. Pituitary microadenomas that do not appear on designated pituitary MRI or dynamic contrast protocols may pose a particularly challenging subset of this disease. The treatment of Cushing's Disease typically involves transsphenoidal surgical resection of the pituitary adenoma as a first-line option, yet may require the addition of adjunctive measures such as stereotactic radiosurgery or medical management to achieve normalization of serum cortisol levels. Vigilant long-term serial endocrine monitoring of patients is imperative in order to detect any recurrence that may occur, even years following initial remission. In this paper, a stepwise approach to the diagnosis, and various management strategies and associated outcomes in patients with Cushing's Disease are discussed.
