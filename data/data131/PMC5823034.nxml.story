Acne vulgaris is a chronic inflammatory disease that affects the pilosebaceous unit. Recent studies have shown an increasing number of cases of acne in adult women. These cases are predominantly normoandrogenic and present some clinical differences compared to adolescent acne. Local glandular metabolism turns some weak hormonal precursors into more active substances that increase the production of sebum, leaving these areas more prone to an increasing the colonization by Propionibacterium acnes (P. acnes). Our objective was to evaluate the usefulness of an androgenic metabolite as an adult female acne biomarker. The study population consisted of 38 adult women with acne without any features of hyperandrogenism and a control group. They were recruited from the clinic of Dermatology Hospital Division of São Paulo, Federal University of São Paulo from January 2012 to September 2014. After the first hormonal dosages, patients with acne were randomized into two different groups: one receiving a combined oral contraceptive (COC) containing 0,02 mg of ethinylestradiol and 3 mg drospirenone in a regimen of 24 days of medication, and the other group was treated with a topical gel containing 15% azelaic acid (AA), twice daily, both for six months. With the end of treatment new dosages were performed. Regarding the hormones, total and free testosterone and dehydroepiandrosterone sultate were quantified. In addition, the detection and quantification of androsterone glucuronate (ADT-G), an androgenic metabolite, has been developed. Only ADT-G was sensitive in detecting differences between the control and acne groups, and presented reduction of their values with systemic treatment. Therefore, only ADT-G was able to analyze the peripheral hyperandrogenism in cases of adult female acne.
