Tauopathy including Alzheimerâ€™s disease (AD) is characterized by a build-up of tau aggregates in the brain, highly associated with failure of cellular protein homeostasis. Proteostasis can be achieved by protein quality control system to cope with numerous stresses such as proteotoxic stress from misfolded proteins. This cellular protective system includes heat shock response regulated by heat shock factor 1 (HSF1) activation and unfolded protein response in ER. Despite the importance of stress response in maintaining proteostasis, their role in neurodegenerative diseases like tauopathy is not clearly understood. The current study reports how the interplay between the two stress response systems, unfolded protein response and HSF1 promotes early tau pathology and identifies HSF1 protein degradation being one likely key player in both human AD and tau transgenic mouse AD models. We identify aging-associated AD-like neuropathological changes in the hippocampus of HSF1 heterozygous knock-out mice. We speculate that that HSF1 loss may constitute a mechanistic connection between ER stress and tau hyperphosphorylation in tau pathology. This study demonstrates the potential therapeutic significance of stabilizing HSF1 protein in treating AD.
