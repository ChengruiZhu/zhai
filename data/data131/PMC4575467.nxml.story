This study will recruit 430 participants with end-stage renal disease on dialysis from satellite and home-therapy dialysis units across multiple health organisations in Melbourne, Victoria, Australia. Data collection at baseline will include a participant interview, medical record review, completion of a health-status questionnaire and a non-invasive foot assessment. Twenty participants will also be recruited to a reliability study to evaluate the reproducibility of testing procedures. Primary outcome data includes: new foot ulcer(s). Secondary outcome data includes: number of new foot ulcers, time to onset of new foot ulcer(s), new lower extremity amputation(s), episodes of infection of the foot or lower extremity, episodes of osteomyelitis, foot-related hospitalisations, revascularisation procedure(s) of the lower extremity, new podiatry interventions, kidney transplantation, and mortality. Participants will be assessed at baseline, and at 12Â months they will be evaluated for the primary and secondary outcomes. Multivariate Cox proportional hazards models will be used to assess predictors of new foot ulceration and time to event secondary outcomes. Logistic regression will be used for binary outcomes including prevalence of foot ulcerations.
