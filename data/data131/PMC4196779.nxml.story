A total of 576 children, aged 27 to 48 months, were evaluated in person. Information was available from local data records for another 191 children, aged 18 to 50 months, of whom 68 (38%) had neurodevelopmental impairment. Of babies born at less than 27 weeks’ gestation in 2006, 77 (13.4%) had severe, and 68 (11.8%) had moderate impairment. Rates for cognitive, communication, and motor impairment were 16%, 11%, and 8%, respectively. An inverse relationship was observed between gestational age and prevalence of moderate or severe impairment, that is, 45% of survivors at 22 to 23 weeks to 30% at 24 weeks, 25% at 25 weeks, and 20% at 26 weeks. Eighty-three children had cerebral palsy, 32 (39%) with diplegia, 21 (25%) with hemiplegia, 10 (12%) with quadriplegia, and 20 (24%) with other types. Nine children (11%) with cerebral palsy had severe sensory impairment; developmental testing showed severe, moderate, or mild impairment in 47 (57%), 30 (46%), and 6 (7%) children, respectively. For births at less than 27 weeks’ gestation in 2006, survival free of moderate or severe impairment ranged from 8% at 23 weeks’ gestation to 59% at 26 weeks’ gestation. Based on babies who received active intervention after birth, rates ranged from 11% at 23 weeks’ gestation to 60% at 26 weeks’ gestation and for babies receiving intensive care from 15% to 61%, respectively.
