Breast cancer, the second leading cause of cancer death of women worldwide, is a heterogenous disease. Different subtypes of breast cancer display very different expression programs, and these expression programs are associated with different patient outcomes and with different treatment protocols. However, little is known about what drives these subtype differences. By sequencing RNA in a discovery cohort of breast cancer patients, we demonstrate that different subtypes of breast cancer can be distinguished by simply using differential transcript isoform expression. We confirmed our findings using two additional patient cohorts. We also demonstrate that differential expression of RNA processing factors between subtypes can affect differences in isoform usage. Using RNAi we knock down differentially expressed RNA processing factors including YBX1, YBX2, MAGOH, MAGOHB, and PCBP2, and show that this knock-down results in differential isoform expression of the genes identified in our disease subtype panel. Taken together, our results indicate that global dysregulation of splicing occurs in a subtype-specific and reproducible manner in breast cancer, and is driven by specific differentially expressed RNA processing factors.
