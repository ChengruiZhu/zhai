Neuroscientists commonly measure the time-varying activity of neurons in the brain. Early studies explored how such activity directly encodes sensory stimuli. Since then neural responses have also been found to encode abstract parameters such as expected reward. Yet not all aspects of neural activity directly encode identifiable parameters: patterns of activity sometimes reflect the evolution of underlying internal computations, and may be only obliquely related to specific parameters. For example, it remains debated whether cortical activity during movement relates to parameters such as reach velocity, to parameters such as muscle activity, or to underlying computations that culminate in the production of muscle activity. To address this question we exploited an unexpected fact. When activity directly encodes a parameter it tends to be mathematically simple in a very particular way. When activity reflects the evolution of a computation being performed by the network, it tends to be mathematically simple in a different way. We found that responses in a visual area were simple in the first way, consistent with encoding of parameters. We found that responses in a motor area were simple in the second way, consistent with participation in the underlying computations that culminate in movement.
