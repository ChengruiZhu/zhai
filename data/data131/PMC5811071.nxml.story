It has been revealed that the cellular membrane is an active contributor to biological processes occurring in and across it and can regulate the function of proteins embedded within it. Cholesterol (CHOL) plays a key role in these effects. Notably, CHOL affects neurotransmission. Neurotransmission occurs at the synapse and is central to a proper functioning of the human nervous system. In particular, monoamine transporters (MATs), key players in the process of stopping signaling, are primary targets for treatment of mental disorders. Herein, we address the intriguing mechanism by which the presence of CHOL affects the function of MATs. CHOL is known to modulate the re-uptake of neurotransmitters from the synapse but the mechanism is not known. We looked at the possibility of CHOL effecting MATs by a direct interaction rather than through its effect on the biophysical properties of the embedding membrane. We present clear data indicative of conserved CHOL binding sites on all human MATs and further show how CHOL prevents conformational changes at the intracellular end of transmembrane helix 5 in the human dopamine transporter (hDAT), which we are able to confirm is associated with the outward-to-inward transition of MATs.
