Previous studies have revealed the clinical significance of tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) in gastric cancer, whereas the role of the cytokines that orchestrate TAM polarization in gastric cancer remains elusive. The present study aimed to evaluate the prognostic value of granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) expression in patients with gastric cancer. Intratumoral GM-CSF expression was investigated by immunohistochemical staining in 408 retrospectively enrolled patients. Kaplan-Meier analysis and Cox regression models were used to evaluate the prognostic value of GM-CSF expression. Predictive nomograms were generated to predict the overall survival and disease-free survival rates of the patients. Decreased intratumoral GM-CSF expression was identified, and indicated a poorer clinical outcome for patients with gastric cancer, particularly in advanced stages. Intratumoral GM-CSF expression may provide an additional risk stratification for the prognosis of patients with gastric cancer based on the Tumor-Node-Metastasis (TNM) staging system. Cox multivariate analysis identified GM-CSF expression as an independent prognostic factor for overall survival and disease-free survival time. The generated nomograms performed well in predicting the 3-and 5-year clinical outcome of patients with gastric cancer. In conclusion, GM-CSF is a potential independent prognostic indicator for patients with gastric cancer, which may be integrated with TNM staging systems to improve the predictive accuracy for clinical outcome, particularly in advanced tumors.
