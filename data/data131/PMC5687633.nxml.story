Sertoli cells, by creating an immune-privileged and nutrition supporting environment, maintain mammalian spermatogenesis and thereby holds the heart of male fertility. Olaquindox, an effective feed additive in livestock industry, could potentially expose human into the risk of biological hazards due to its genotoxicity and cytotoxicity, highlighting the significance of determining its bio-safety regarding human reproduction. Herein, we deciphered the detrimental effects of olaquindox on male fertility by mechanistically unraveling how olaquindox intervenes blood-testis barrier in mouse. Olaquindox (400 Î¼g/ml) exposure significantly compromised tight junction permeability function, decreased or dislocated the junction proteins (e.g., ZO-1, occludin and N-cadherin) and attenuated mTORC2 signaling pathway in primary Sertoli cells. Furthermore, olaquindox disrupted F-actin architecture through interfering with the expression of actin branching protein complex (CDC42-N-WASP-Arp3) and actin bunding protein palladin. Olaquindox also triggered severely DNA damage and apoptosis while inhibiting autophagic flux in Sertoli cell presumably due to the exacerbated generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Pre-treatment with antioxidant N-acetylcysteine effectively ameliorated olaquindox-induced exhaustion of ZO-1 and N-Cadherin proteins, DNA damage and apoptosis. More significantly, olaquindox disrupted the epigenetic status in Sertoli cells with hypermethylation and concomitantly hypoacetylation of H3K9 and H3K27. Overall, our study determines olaquindox targets Sertoli cells to affect BTB function through tight junction proteins and F-actin orgnization, which might disrupt the process of spermatogenesis.
