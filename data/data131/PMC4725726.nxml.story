Ofatumumab is one of the three anti-CD20 monoclonal antibodies currently available for the treatment of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved the use of ofatumumab in patients with CLL refractory to fludarabine and alemtuzumab in 2009, and the European Medicines Agency (EMA) granted approval for the same indication in 2010. Subsequent positive results of ofatumumab in combination with chlorambucil in treatment-na√Øve patients led the FDA in April 2014 to approve the use of this combination for first-line treatment of patients with CLL for whom fludarabine-based therapy is considered inappropriate. Later that year, the EMA approved the use of ofatumumab in combination with chlorambucil or bendamustine for the same indication. Ofatumumab has also shown potential as maintenance therapy for patients with relapsed CLL; an application to broaden the label for ofatumumab as maintenance therapy was submitted earlier this year to the EMA and FDA. Finally, ofatumumab has shown promising activity in combination with ibrutinib or idelalisib in relapsed/refractory CLL patients; combinations of ofatumumab with B-cell-receptor pathway inhibitors could represent another potential use of this antibody in the near future.
