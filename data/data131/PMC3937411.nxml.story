Sensory systems communicate information to the brain — and brain areas communicate between themselves — via the electrical activities of their respective neurons. These activities are “noisy”: repeat presentations of the same stimulus do not yield to identical responses every time. Furthermore, the neurons' responses are not independent: the variability in their responses is typically correlated from cell to cell. How does this change the impact of the noise — for better or for worse? Our goal here is to classify (broadly) the sorts of noise correlations that are either good or bad for enabling populations of neurons to transmit information. This is helpful as there are many possibilities for the noise correlations, and the set of possibilities becomes large for even modestly sized neural populations. We prove mathematically that, for larger populations, there are many highly diverse ways that favorable correlations can occur. These often differ from the noise correlation structures that are typically identified as beneficial for information transmission – those that follow the so-called “sign rule.” Our results help in interpreting some recent data that seems puzzling from the perspective of this rule.
