 = 3,025) at months 0, 1 and 6. The primary objective was vaccine efficacy (VE) against HPV-16/18 associated 6-month persistent infection (PI) and/or cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) 1+. Secondary objectives were VE against virological and clinical endpoints associated with HPV-16/18 and with high-risk HPV types, immunogenicity and safety. Mean follow-up for the according-to-protocol cohort for efficacy (ATP-E) was ∼15 months after the third dose. In the ATP-E (vaccine = 2,889; control = 2,894), for initially HPV DNA negative and seronegative subjects, HPV-16/18 related VE (95% CI) was 94.2% (62.7, 99.9) against 6-month PI and/or CIN1+ and 93.8% (60.2, 99.9) against cytological abnormalities. VE against HPV-16/18 associated CIN1+ and CIN2+ was 100% (−50.4, 100) and 100% (−140.2, 100), respectively (no cases in the vaccine group and 4 CIN1+ and 3 CIN2+ cases in the control group). At Month 7, at least 99.7% of initially seronegative vaccine recipients had seroconverted for HPV-16/18; geometric mean antibody titres (95% CI) were 6,996 (6,212 to 7,880) EU/mL for anti-HPV-16 and 3,309 (2,942 to 3,723) EU/mL for anti-HPV-18. Safety outcomes between groups were generally similar. The HPV-16/18 AS04-adjuvanted vaccine is effective, immunogenic and has a clinically acceptable safety profile in young Chinese women. Prophylactic HPV vaccination has the potential to substantially reduce the burden of cervical cancer in China.
