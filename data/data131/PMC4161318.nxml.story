Meiosis is a specialized type of cell division that gives rise to sperm and eggs. In a woman's thirties, errors in meiotic chromosome segregation rise exponentially, significantly increasing the probability that she will conceive a fetus with Down Syndrome (Trisomy 21). Accurate chromosome segregation during meiosis depends on protein linkages (cohesion) that hold sister chromatids together. The widely held view is that under normal conditions, cohesion can only be established during DNA replication, and the original cohesive linkages formed in fetal oocytes are gradually lost as a woman ages. However, it seems unlikely that the same cohesion proteins could survive for even five years, much less 25 years. Here we show that Drosophila oocytes possess an active rejuvenation program that is required to load newly synthesized cohesion proteins and to establish new cohesive linkages after meiotic DNA replication. When we reduce the proteins responsible for rejuvenation after meiotic S phase, cohesion is lost and meiotic chromosomes missegregate. If such a rejuvenation pathway also exists in human oocytes and becomes less efficient with age, oocytes of older women may no longer be able to replace cohesive linkages at the same rate that they are lost.
