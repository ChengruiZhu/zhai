Colony stimulating factor 1 receptor (CSF-1R) regulates the monocyte/macrophage system, which is an essential component of cancer development. Therefore, CSF-1R might be an effective target for anti-cancer therapy. The overexpression of transforming growth factor (TGF)-β stimulated clone-22 (TSC-22) inhibits cancer cell proliferation and induces apoptosis, and TSC-22 is emerging as a key factor in tumorigenesis. In this study, we discovered CSF-1R as a new interacting partner of TSC-22 and identified its elevated expression in cervical cancer cells. In particular, we found that TSC-22 interacted with the intracellular tyrosine kinase insert domain (539–749) of CSF-1R, which activates the AKT and ERK signaling pathways. This binding blocked AKT and ERK signaling, thereby suppressing the transcriptional activity of NF-κB. The overexpression of TSC-22 significantly decreased CSF-1R protein levels, affecting their autocrine loop. TSC-22 injected into a xenograft mouse model of human cervical cancer markedly inhibited tumor growth. The reduction of CSF-1R protein significantly suppresses cervical cancer cell proliferation and motility and induces apoptotic cell death. This association between TSC-22 and CSF-1R could be used as a novel therapeutic target and prognostic marker for cervical cancer.
