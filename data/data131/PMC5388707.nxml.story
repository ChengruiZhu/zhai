There are many qualitative indicators for postmortem interval (PMI) of human or animal cadavers. When such indicators are uniformly spaced over PMI, the resultant distribution may be very useful for the estimation of PMI. Existing methods of estimation rely on indicator persistence time that is, however, difficult to estimate because of its dependence on many interacting factors, of which forensic scientists are usually unaware in casework. In this article, an approach is developed for the estimation of PMI from qualitative markers in which indicator persistence time is not used. The method involves the estimation of an interval preceding appearance of a marker on cadaver called the pre-appearance interval (PAI). PMI is delineated by PAI for two consecutive markers: the one being recorded on the cadaver (defining lower PMI) and the other that is next along the PMI timeline but yet absent on the cadaver (defining upper PMI). The approach was calibrated for use with subsequent life stages of carrion insects and tested using results of pig cadaver experiments. Results demonstrate that the presence and absence of the subsequent developmental stages of carrion insects, coupled with the estimation of their PAI, gives a reliable and easily accessible knowledge of PMI in a forensic context.
