Eukaryotic protein kinases (EPKs) regulate over a third of the human proteome by transferring the γ-phosphate from adenosine triphosphate (ATP) to a protein substrate in a process known as protein phosphorylation. Biochemical and biophysical studies have shown that EPKs undergo multiconformational rearrangements in which the catalytic core is oscillating between open, intermediate, and closed conformations when active. Presently, the intramolecular interactions that regulate this dynamic process are not well understood. In this paper, we show how a set of conserved electrostatic and hydrophobic interactions harmoniously regulate the active state mechanics. The electrostatic interactions involve the highly conserved salt bridge between the lysine from subdomain-II and glutamate from subdomain-III as well as an interaction between the activation loop and αC-helix. The hydrophobic interactions include the nonlinear motifs known as the Regulatory spine and Shell that traverse both lobes of the catalytic core. Furthermore, our findings show that the highly conserved “catalytic lysine” is not directly required for phosphoryl transfer but rather serves as a hub that aligns and positions the dynamic core elements required for catalysis.
