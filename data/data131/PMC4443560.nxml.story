The present study aims to evaluate and validate the Italian version of Khalfa's questionnaire on hyperacusis (HQ). We recruited 117 patients (64 men, 53 women, mean age 53 years, range 14-88) with tinnitus for at least 3 months as a primary disorder. All patients completed the THI and the Italian version of the HQ and underwent audiometry, pitch and loudness tinnitus matching, otoacoustic emissions with distortion products (DPOAE) and uncomfortable loudness level (ULL). The overall performance of the tests was evaluated and compared using the area under the RO C curve (AUC) relative to the tests. The cut-off of the HQ was calculated. We also assessed the Cronbach's alpha (αC) for the HQ and its three major dimensions (attentional - αC1, emotional - αC2 and social - αC3). Statistical analysis showed no correlation between DPOAE, audiometry, ULL and gender. We observed a high correlation (p < 0.05) between hyperacusis and ULL described by the Spearman's ρ index (rs = 0.72). We found a cut-off of 16 indicative of hyperacusis comparing the area under the RO C curve (AUC) of HQ and audiometry, taken as a diagnostic reference, (sensitivity = 67.9% and specificity = 72.2%). The reliability of HQ was confirmed by a high αC = 0.89. The αC for the single dimensional scales were, respectively, αC1 = 0.73, αC2 = 0.72 and αC3 = 0.81. The Italian version of the HQ is recommended for proper and complete classification of patients with tinnitus and hyperacusis. From our study, we found a cut-off of 16 instead of the cut-off of 28 described as very high by other authors. Moreover, ULL was an important variable and can be discriminating in the evaluation of hyperacusis.
