Recent data supports a potentially significant role for immune checkpoint inhibitors in the treatment of gastric cancer. However, there are few data on the clinical implications of immunotherapy markers in gastric signet-ring cell carcinoma (SRCC). We evaluated the expression of programmed cell death protein-1 (PD-1), programmed cell death ligand 1(PD-L1), infiltration by CD3+ T cell, microsatellite instability (MSI), and Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV), and the relationship of each factor to survival in 89 advanced SRCC patients. All patients received 5-FU-based first-line chemotherapy. PD-L1 and PD-1 were expressed in 40.4% and 18.0% of the patients, respectively. There was a significant correlation between PD-L1 and PD-1 expression (r=0.363, p<0.001). There was loss of at least 1 of the 4 DNA mismatch repair (DNA-MMR) gene proteins in 32.6% of samples. Only 1 case out of 89 was EBV positive, with concurrent PD-L1 positivity, a high degree of CD3+ T cell infiltration and MSI. Increased CD3+ T cells numbers was associated with increased PD-1 expression (r=0.256, p=0.012) and MSI status (r=0.208, p=0.049). High CD3+ T cell infiltration was related to better OS (23.7 months, 95% CI: 19.0-38.0
