Lung adenocarcinoma is the most common pathological pattern of lung cancer. During the past decades, a number of targeted agents have been explored to treat advanced lung adenocarcinoma. In the present clinical practice, antagonists of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-directed therapies are widely used. In the former category, the agent erlotinib (tyrosine kinase inhibitor) has shown obvious advantages over cytotoxic therapy. Anti-VEGF therapy bevacizumab used for lung adenocarcinoma was recommended in NCCN Clinical Practice Guidelines in Oncology (NCCN Guidelines) as first-line therapy. Similarly, apatinib is speculated to response by selectively inhibiting the vascular endothelial growth factor receptor-2. The patient with unknown EGFR status benefited 5-month progressive free survival (PFS) from erlotinib, and then another 5.1-month PFS with combined treatment of apatinib, which suggested a new option for lung adenocarcinoma. However, when dabigatran was used to cancer-related venous thromboembolism during apatinib therapy, extensive subcutaneous bleeding occurred, warning us against the risks of bleeding. Besides, hypertension and anorexia were observed, causing dosage adjustment.
