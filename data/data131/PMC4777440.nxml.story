The 50th anniversary of Monod-Changeux-Jacob seminal paper “Allosteric proteins and cellular control systems” became the hallmark of a new wave in the allostery studies and the turning point in our vision of allostery and its implications in protein engineering and drug design. Recent experimental and theoretical works clearly show relevance of allosteric phenomenon to drug design, unraveling advantages of allosteric drugs in comparison to traditional orthosteric compounds. Remarkable simplicity of allosteric effectors and, at the same time, their potentially high specificity is one of the most important traits. The non conserved nature of allosteric ligands is a basis for avoiding drug resistance, and existence of latent regulatory sites make them attractive drug targets. The model presented in this work provides a theoretical framework for the quantification of the causality and energetics of allosteric regulation, which is a prerequisite for design of effector molecules with required characteristics. The synthesis between the thermodynamics of allostery and the intrinsic atomic nature of proteins and their interactions with the allosteric effectors accomplished in this work is a small initial step in the long endeavor towards future allosteric drugs.
