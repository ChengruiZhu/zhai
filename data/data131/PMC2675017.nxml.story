Vascular complications, as a consequence of atherosclerosis, are main causes of morbidity and mortality in patients with diabetes mellitus. There is increasing evidence that lipid peroxidation and oxidative modification of low density lipoprotein (LDL) is important in atherogenesis. In this study we investigated the effect of soybean hypocotyl extract (SHE), rich in isoflavones and saponins, on lipid peroxide (LPO) levels in liver, plasma and lipoproteins in GK diabetic rats, and its efficacy on the reduction of susceptibility of LDL and high density lipoprotein (HDL) to oxidation. The oxidative modification of LDL and HDL was determined with the lag time of copper ion-induced oxidation curve identified by the conjugated dienes. In SHE group which were fed diet containing 40 g/kg of SHE for 16 weeks, LPO levels in liver, plasma and HDL fraction were significantly decreased compared with the control group. The lag phage of LDL oxidation curve was prolonged noticeably by a mean of 27 min in SHE group as compared to the control group, indicating a reduced susceptibility to oxidation. The results suggest that intake of soybean hypocotyl extract might be useful for the prevention and treatment of diabetes mellitus and diabetes-associated diseases.
