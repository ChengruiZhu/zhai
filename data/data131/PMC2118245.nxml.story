Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-A has essential roles in vasculogenesis and angiogenesis, but the downstream steps and mechanisms by which human VEGF-A acts are incompletely understood. We report here that human VEGF-A exerts much of its angiogenic activity by up-regulating the expression of TR3 (mouse homologue Nur77), an immediate-early response gene and orphan nuclear receptor transcription factor previously implicated in tumor cell, lymphocyte, and neuronal growth and apoptosis. Overexpression of TR3 in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) resulted in VEGF-A–independent proliferation, survival, and induction of several cell cycle genes, whereas expression of antisense TR3 abrogated the response to VEGF-A in these assays and also inhibited tube formation. Nur77 was highly expressed in several types of VEGF-A–dependent pathological angiogenesis in vivo. Also, using a novel endothelial cell-selective retroviral targeting system, overexpression of Nur77 DNA potently induced angiogenesis in the absence of exogenous VEGF-A, whereas Nur77 antisense strongly inhibited VEGF-A–induced angiogenesis. B16F1 melanoma growth and angiogenesis were greatly inhibited in Nur77
