Little is known about the postprandial remodelling of erythrocytes phospholipids (PLs) in type 2 diabetics (T2DM). Therefore, this study aims to compare the alterations of erythrocyte PLs in T2DM to those of healthy subjects after ingestion of a high-fat meal. Eleven T2DM and ten healthy subjects underwent a high-fat meal loading. Erythrocytes were isolated from blood obtained after fasting and 4Â h after the meal. Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy was initially used to screen erythrocyte PLs by monitoring C-H stretching vibrations. Phosphatidylcholine (PC) molecular species were further investigated by Liquid Chromatography-Electrospray Ionisation-Mass Spectrometry (LC-ESI-MS). For the control group, FTIR revealed postprandial changes in C-H stretching vibrations, particularly of the olefinic band. These findings were supported by LC-ESI-MS data, showing marked changes in PC molecular species, especially of the PC34:1 (where 34 and 1 mean the summed number of carbons and double bonds, respectively). However, similar changes of those were not apparent in the T2DM group. Our results reveal marked postprandial alterations of erythrocyte PC species in healthy subjects whereas only mild alterations are observed in T2DM. The discrepant effects of high-fat meal loading suggest abnormal PC remodelling in the diabetic erythrocyte that may affect its membrane fluidity and integrity.
