Mammalian germ cells (eggs and sperm) are immortal in the sense that they propagate successive generations. In contrast, somatic (body) cells do not persist to the next generation. Yet neither plants nor basal animals such as sponges and corals have a germline; they simply form gametes from stem cells in adult tissues. The reasons for these differences are unknown. We develop an evolutionary model showing that the germline evolved in response to selection on mitochondria, the powerhouses of cells. Mitochondria retain their own genes, which occur in multiple copies per cell. In plants and basal animals, the mitochondrial genes mutate slowly. Segregation over the many rounds of cell division to form an adult generates variation in mutant mitochondria between gametes, sufficient for natural selection to improve mitochondrial function. In more active animals from the Cambrian explosion onwards, the mitochondrial mutation rate rose strongly. This required the evolution of a dedicated germline, set aside early in development, with lowered mutational input. It also favoured large eggs (starting with thousands of mitochondria) and culling, following overproduction (atresia). Both devices maintain mitochondrial quality. The evolution of germline sequestration had profound consequences, allowing the emergence of complex developmental processes and truly disposable adult tissues.
