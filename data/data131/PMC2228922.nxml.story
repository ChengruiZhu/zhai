Ion-sensitive microelectrodes and current-voltage analysis were used to study intracellular pH (pHi) regulation and its effects on ionic conductances in the isolated epithelium of frog skin. We show that pHi recovery after an acid load is dependent on the operation of an amiloride-sensitive Na+/H+ exchanger localized at the basolateral cell membranes. The antiporter is not quiescent at physiological pHi (7.1- 7.4) and, thus, contributes to the maintenance of steady state pHi. Moreover, intracellular sodium ion activity is also controlled in part by Na+ uptake via the exchanger. Intracellular acidification decreased transepithelial Na+ transport rate, apical Na+ permeability (PNa) and Na+ and K+ conductances. The recovery of these transport parameters after the removal of the acid load was found to be dependent on pHi regulation via Na+/H+ exchange. Conversely, variations in Na+ transport were accompanied by changes in pHi. Inhibition of Na+/K+ ATPase by ouabain produced covariant decreases in pHi and PNa, whereas increases in Na+ transport, occurring spontaneously or after aldosterone treatment, were highly correlated with intracellular alkalinization. We conclude that cytoplasmic H+ activity is regulated by a basolateral Na+/H+ exchanger and that transcellular coupling of ion flows at opposing cell membranes can be modulated by the pHi-regulating mechanism.
