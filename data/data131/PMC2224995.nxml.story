 Fowler's bacillus is one of several organisms which form a non-viable inclusion or parasporal body during the process of sporulation. This body is globular and may be as large as or larger than the spore. Its position in the cell is not random; the spore is terminal and the body paracentral, lying between the spore and the remaining vegetative cell chromatin bodies. On completion of sporulation both spore and body are contained within an exosporium. The sequence in the development of the cell structures was followed in ultrathin sections of material fixed in permanganate. When sporulation is well advanced the body begins to grow from a single crystal, then presumably as a result of some disorientation in the growth process it develops as a multicrystalline body with the lattices orientated at different angles. When the body approximates the spore in size, a lamella coat is formed and an exosporium develops which eventually encircles the body and the spore. Other lamella systems microscopically similar to those surrounding the parasporal body develop free in the cytoplasm outside the exosporium. In both of these systems the number of lamellae is variable. The spore coat of Fowler's bacillus, consisting of an outer lamella layer and an inner unresolved amorphous layer has been found microscopically identical to the spore coat of
