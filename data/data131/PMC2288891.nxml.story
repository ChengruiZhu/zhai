The polyphosphoinositides, PIP and PIP2, have been proposed to regulate actin polymerization in vivo because they dissociate actin/gelsolin complexes in vitro. We tested this hypothesis by comparing the ability of EGF and bradykinin to affect PI metabolism and the actin cytoskeleton in A431 cells. EGF, but not bradykinin, was found to induce ruffling and dissociation of actin/gelsolin complexes in these cells. However, both EGF and bradykinin stimulated the accumulation of inositol phosphates in [3H]inositol-labeled cells indicating that stimulation of PI turnover is not sufficient for the induction of changes in actin/gelsolin complex levels. EGF stimulated a twofold increase in the level of PIP in A431 cells. Other phosphoinositide levels were not markedly altered. Treatment of the cells with cholera toxin abrogated the EGF-induced rise in PIP levels without altering the dissociation of actin from gelsolin. These data indicate that increases in PIP and/or PIP2 are not necessary for dissociation of actin/gelsolin complexes. Overall, these experiments suggest that in A431 cells, the effects of EGF on the actin cytoskeleton are unlikely to be mediated through changes in PIP or PIP2 levels.
