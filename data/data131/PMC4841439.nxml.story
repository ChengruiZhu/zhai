H-nuclear magnetic resonance and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, and crystalline-to-amorphous transformation was determined by differential scanning calorimetry and X-ray diffractometry. In vitro skin penetration was analyzed using fresh pig skin mounted on Franz diffusion cells, and cytotoxicity against human keratinocyte HaCaT cells was evaluated using the MTT assay. Antioxidant activity was determined by 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl-free radical scavenging ability. EEâ€“PVA-loaded 734THIF nanoparticles showed good drug loading and encapsulation efficiencies and were characterized by improved physicochemical properties, including reduction in particle size, amorphous transformation, and intermolecular hydrogen-bond formation. This is associated with increased water solubility and enhanced in vitro skin penetration, with no cytotoxicity toward HaCaT cells. In addition, 734THIF nanoparticles retained their antioxidant activity. In conclusion, 734THIF nanoparticles are characterized by improved physicochemical properties, increased water solubility, and enhanced skin penetration, and these may have potential use in the future as a topical delivery formulation for the treatment of skin diseases.
