Tumorigenesis results from the convergence of cell autonomous mutations and corresponding stromal changes that promote tumor cell growth. Senescent cells, which secrete a plethora of pro-tumorigenic factors termed the senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP), play an important role in tumor formation. Investigation into SASP regulation revealed that many but not all SASP factors are subject to NF-kB and p38MAPK regulation. However, many pro-tumorigenic SASP factors, including osteopontin (OPN), are not responsive to these canonical pathways leaving the regulation of these factors an open question. We report that the transcription factor c-Myb regulates OPN, IL-6, and IL-8 in addition to 57 other SASP factors. The regulation of OPN is direct as c-Myb binds to the OPN promoter in response to senescence. Further, OPN is also regulated by the known SASP regulator C/EBPβ. In response to senescence, the full-length activating C/EBPβ isoform LAP2 increases binding to the OPN, IL-6, and IL-8 promoters. The importance of both c-Myb and C/EBPβ is underscored by our finding that the depletion of either factor reduces the ability of senescent fibroblasts to promote the growth of preneoplastic epithelial cells.
