In eukaryotes, DNA is packaged together with histones into nucleosomes. This packaging has a repressive role on gene expression. The N-termini of histones are subject to multiple modifications that affect DNAâ€“dependent processes. The histone modification that has been predominantly linked with active transcription in all eukaryotes is histone H3 lysine 4 (H3K4) methylation. Here we investigate the functional effects of each H3K4 methylation state on transcription. Removal of the mark that is most characteristic for transcription, H3K4 trimethylation, has no effect on coding gene expression, in steady-state or dynamically changing conditions. Combined loss of H3K4 tri- and di-methylation does have an effect and leads to loss of repression of specific genes, the opposite of what is expected for global marks of active genes. The affected genes have antisense transcription. We show that there are two separate mechanisms through which H3K4 methylation represses transcription of protein-coding genes, one through antisense transcripts and one through the process of antisense transcription. In summary, we show how a general mark of active transcription can have specific repressive effects that are themselves also linked to repression through nucleosomes.
