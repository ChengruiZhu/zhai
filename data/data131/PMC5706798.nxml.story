Disruption of RNA splicing causes genome instability, which could contribute to cancer etiology. Furthermore, RNA splicing is an emerging anti-cancer target. Thus, we have evaluated the influence of the spliceosome factor PRPF8 and the splicing inhibitor Pladienolide B (PlaB) on homologous recombination (HR). We find that PRPF8 depletion and PlaB treatment cause a specific defect in homology-directed repair (HDR), and single strand annealing (SSA), which share end resection as a common intermediate, and BRCA1 as a required factor. Furthermore, PRPF8 depletion and PlaB treatment cause reduced end resection detected as chromatin-bound RPA, BRCA1 foci in response to damage, and histone acetylation marks that are associated with BRCA1-mediated HR. We also identified distinctions between PlaB and PRPF8 depletion, in that PlaB also reduces 53BP1 foci, and BRCA1 expression. Furthermore loss of 53BP1, which rescues SSA in BRCA1 depleted cells, and partially rescues SSA in PRPF8 depleted cells, has no effect on SSA in PlaB treated cells. Finally, while PRPF8 depletion has no obvious effect on the integrity of interchromatin granules, PlaB disrupts these structures. These findings indicate that PRPF8 is important for BRCA1-mediated HR, whereas PlaB also has a more general effect on the DNA damage response and nuclear organization.
