It is not known whether serum potassium levels affect blood pressure response to anti-hypertensive medication. The African American trial of Kidney disease and Hypertension (AASK) Genomics Study (N=828) is a subset of the AASK trial that randomized 1,094 African American men and women with hypertensive nephrosclerosis to ramipril, amlodipine or metoprolol. Participants were also randomized to a usual (102–107 mmHg) or low (≤92 mmHg) mean arterial pressure (MAP) treatment goal. Time-to-event analyses were used to determine the relationship between serum potassium prior to randomization and time (days) to reach an MAP of 107 mmHg. Mean baseline serum potassium was 4.22 (standard deviation +/− 0.56 and range 2.8–6.0) mmol/L and the median days to reach target MAP was 32 (interquartile range 8–95) days. The adjusted hazard ratio (HR) for each 1mmol/L increase in serum potassium was 1.31 (95%CI: 1.08–1.59) in the usual MAP group, and 1.21 (95%CI: 1.02–1.44) in the low MAP group. Secondary findings suggested that women in the usual MAP group on amlodipine were more likely to reach target MAP compared to women randomized to ramipril (HR: 2.05, 95%CI: 1.30–3.21). Older subjects in the low MAP group (≥55 years) were also more likely to reach target MAP on amlodipine compared to ramipril (HR: 1.57, 95%CI: 1.03–2.38). Serum potassium appears to be a significant predictor of time to blood pressure response, independent of drug class. Results also suggest a benefit of using amlodipine when more rapid blood pressure control is clinically indicated among women and more aggressively managed older subjects.
