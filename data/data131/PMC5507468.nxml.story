The transition from a normal cell to a cancer cell is driven by genetic alterations, such as mutations, that induce uncontrolled cell proliferation. With the advent of next-generation sequencing technologies (NGS) in the last decade, thousands of tumours have been sequenced and their mutation profiles determined. However, the statistical analysis of these mutation profiles remains challenging. Indeed, two patients usually do not share the same set of mutations and can even have none in common. Moreover, it is difficult to distinguish the few disease-causing mutations from the dozens, often hundreds of mutations observed in a tumour. To alleviate these challenges, it has been proposed to use gene-gene interaction networks as prior knowledge, with the idea that if a gene is mutated and non-functional, then its interacting neighbours might not be able to fulfil their function as well. Here we propose NetNorM, a method that transforms mutation data using gene networks so as to make mutation profiles more amenable to statistical learning. We show that NetNorM significantly improves the prognostic power of mutation data compared to previous approaches, and allows defining meaningful groups of patients based on their mutation profiles.
