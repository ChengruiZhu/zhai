Acquisition of DNA by horizontal gene transfer (HGT) significantly increases bacterial genetic variability. Relevant issues are the mechanisms that bacterial cells have evolved to efficiently integrate the newly acquired DNA into the host cell regulatory machinery. In Gram negative cells, the nucleoid associated protein H-NS has been shown to bind AT-rich sequences of HGT DNA and silence unwanted expression of these genes. This has led to consider H-NS as a “genome sentinel.” Nevertheless, this proposed role must be compatible with its role modulating core genome genes. Weak expression of recently transferred genes must be coordinated with proper expression levels of housekeeping genes. In this paper, we describe a strategy that enteric bacteria have developed to differentially modulate HGT and core genome genes. Two independent lines of experimental evidence suggest that the H-NS system of enteric bacteria may have evolved to discriminate between core genome and HGT DNA. The plasmid R27-encoded H-NS protein selectively modulates HGT genes. This avoids plasmid-encoded H-NS interfering with modulation of core functions. We also show that, for efficient silencing of HGT genes, resident chromosomal H-NS recruits the Hha protein and forms heteromeric complexes with DNA. In contrast, housekeeping genes are modulated by H-NS alone.
