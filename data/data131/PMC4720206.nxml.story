BL-I occurred in 71/910 (7.8%) of PRBs. The majority of these were BL-T (57/71, 80%; 57/910, 6.3% overall). Patients with BL-I had lower pre-PRB Hgb than those without BL-I (mean ± SD; 10.3 ± 2.0 versus 12.0 ± 2.1 g/dL, P < 0.0001) and a greater change (Δ) in Hgb (2.1 ± 1.6 versus 1.0 ± 0.8 g/dL, P < 0.0001). When compared with higher Hgb, patients with Hgb <9.0 g/dL had more traditional risk factors for bleeding (older age: 49 ± 18 versus 48 ± 18 versus 45 ± 16 years, P = 0.02; female: 72 versus 70 versus 56%, P < 0.0001; higher serum creatinine: 4.0 ± 2.9 versus 2.9 ± 2.6 versus 1.7 ± 1.4 mg/dL, P < 0.0001; higher systolic blood pressure: 138 ± 18 versus 133 ± 19 versus 133 ± 18 mmHg, P = 0.06; higher bleeding time: 7.6 ± 1.8 versus 7.4 ± 2.0 versus 6.7 ± 1.8 min, P < 0.0001). When BL-T was stratified by pre-PRB Hgb, there were more transfusions in those with lower pre-PRB Hgb (24 versus 9 versus 3%, P < 0.0001). However, these patients not only had fewer hematomas (58 versus 83 versus 87%, P = 0.04) but also demonstrated a smaller ΔHgb post-PRB (1.3 ± 1.0 versus 1.8 ± 0.8 versus 3.2 ± 1.6, P < 0.0001) compared with patients with higher pre-PRB Hgb, yet still received a transfusion.
