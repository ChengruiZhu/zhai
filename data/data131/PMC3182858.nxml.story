Allosteric regulation occurs when the function of one part of a protein changes in response to a signal recognized by another part of the protein. Such intra-protein communication is essential for many biochemical processes, allowing the cell to adapt its behavior to a dynamic environment. Most studies of the information conveyance underlying allostery have to date focused on the role of backbone motions in mediating large structural changes. Here we focus instead on more subtle contributions, arising from fluctuations of side-chain torsions. Using a model for side-chain bond rotations in the tightly packed environment imposed by native backbone conformations, we observed significant sensitivity of side-chain organization to small, localized perturbations. This susceptibility arises from correlations among side-chain motions that can propagate information within a protein in complex, heterogeneous ways. Specifically, we found appreciable correlations even between side-chains distant from one another, so that the effect of a minor perturbation at one site on the protein could be observed in the altered fluctuations of side-chains throughout the protein. In conclusion, we have demonstrated that the statistical mechanics of correlated side-chain fluctuations within a model of the folded protein provides the basis for an unconventional but potentially important means of allostery.
