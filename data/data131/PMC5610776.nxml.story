Anthracycline antibiotics are potent anticancer drugs widely used in the treatment of solid tumors and hematological malignancies. Because of their extensive clinical use and their toxic effect on normal cells, in the present study the effect of these drugs on multipotent hematopoietic bone marrow cells was investigated employing, viability tests, PARP cleavage, Hoechst 33258 staining, DNA fragmentation and superoxide anion production techniques. The results revealed that daunorubicin and doxorubicin exhibited time and dose dependent cytotoxicity against the cells and upon increasing the drugs concentrations, apoptosis was occurred after 4 h of incubation and at low concentration of the drugs. The cleavage of poly ADP-ribose polymerase (PARP) demonstrated by daunorubicin and doxorubicin treatment of the cells, suggest that the apoptotic process is PARP dependent. The drugs induced DNA fragmentation and also anion superoxide production was increased upon rising drugs concentrations. From the results it is concluded that anthracycline antibiotics represent cytotoxic effect on hematopoietic progenitor/stem cells of bone marrow, inducing apoptosis and in this process toxicity of daunorubicin is more pronounced compared to doxorubicin.
