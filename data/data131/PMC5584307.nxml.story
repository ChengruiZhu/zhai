 statistic. A total of twelve published articles, involving 3996 cases and 8876 controls were included in this meta-analysis. The pooled results from rs1501299 polymorphism showed decreased risk in homozygote model (TT VS GG: OR=0.67, 95%CI=0.54-0.83). Heterogeneity was detected in our study. Sensitivity analysis and subgroup analysis were conducted in the meta-analysis. For rs2241766 polymorphism, an increased risk was detected in Caucasian subgroup in heterozygote model (CT VS TT: OR=1.19, 95%CI=1.00-1.42). In genotyping method (PCR-RFLP) subgroup, an increased risk was found in recessive model (GG VS GT+TT: OR=2.05, 95%CI=1.23-3.39). In the sensitivity analysis of rs1501299, decreased risk was detected in allelic model (T VS G: OR=0.86, 95%CI=0.76-0.98) and recessive model (TT VS TG+GG: OR=0.47, 95%CI=0.33-0.67). Publication bias is not observed in our results. Our meta-analysis suggests that the rs1501299 polymorphism may play a protective role in CAD in diabetic patients. The rs2241766 polymorphism is found to be associated with a significant increase in CAD risk in Caucasian and genotyping method (PCR-RFLP) subgroups. Further studies are needed to confirm the prediagnostic effect of the two gene polymorphisms in CAD risk in diabetic patients.
