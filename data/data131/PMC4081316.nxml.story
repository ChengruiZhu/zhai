Activation of the endothelium by alkyl-glycerophosphate (AGP) has been implicated in the development of atherosclerosis. Our previous study suggested that cyclic phosphatidic acid (cPA) inhibits arterial wall remodeling in a rat model in vivo. However, the mechanisms through which specific target genes are regulated during this process remain unclear. Here, we examined whether cPA inhibited AGP-induced expression of class I histone deacetylases (HDACs, namely HDAC1, HDAC2, HDAC3, and HDAC8), which may affect subsequent transcriptional activity of target genes. Our experimental results showed that human coronary artery endothelial cells (HCAECs) expressed high levels of HDAC2 and low levels HDAC1, HDAC3, and HDAC8. Moreover, AGP treatment induced downregulation of HDAC2 expression in HCAECs. However, cotreatment with cPA inhibited this downregulation of HDAC2 expression. Interestingly, treatment with AGP increased the expression and secretion of endogenous interleukin (IL)-6 and IL-8; however, this effect was inhibited when HCAECs were cotreated with cPA or the synthetic peroxisome proliferator-activator receptor gamma (PPARÎ³) antagonist T0070907. Thus, our data suggested that cPA may have beneficial effects in inflammation-related cardiovascular disease by controlling HDAC2 regulation.
