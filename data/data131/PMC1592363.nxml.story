To gain new insights into how normal and abnormal epithelial cell (EC) morphogenesis occurs, Grant and colleagues designed, built, and studied a series of discrete event analogues capable of mimicking epithelial growth characteristics in four different culture conditions. The analogues use independent software agents and objects to represent cells and the two environment components. “Cells” interact with local components using an axiomatic decisional process deduced from experimental in vitro observations. During simulations, “cells” form stable structures that mimic counterparts in cell cultures: a set of targeted in vitro phenotypic attributes is matched by the analogue's phenotype. However, the foundational analogue failed to exhibit a behavior characteristic of functionally polarized ECs in stable structures. Iterative refinement solved the problem: the improved analogue is the first model to simultaneously provide a representation of nonpolarized and structurally polarized cell types, and a mechanism for their interconversion. Inflexible axiom application is essential to simulate normal attributes. Selectively changing an axiom or relaxing its application caused growths strikingly characteristic of cancerous and precancerous lesions. Gaining deeper insight into such phenomena can be achieved by replacing low-resolution components with increasingly detailed and realistic components.
