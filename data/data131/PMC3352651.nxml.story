Stability is taken as the most important parameter before opting for any transplantation technique to treat vitiligo. But, simultaneous donor site repigmentation and depigmentation of grafts at the recipient site has been noted. Similarly donor site depigmentation with complete repigmentation of the recipient area with pigment growing out from each graft has been observed. Successful repigmentation after regrafting in previous punch failure cases has also been reported. Koebner's phenomenon from history (Kp-h) and test grafting were the only available indicators to assess stability. It is quite ironic to note that even after four decades of experience in vitiligo surgery, there seems to be little consensus among workers regarding the optimal required period of stability. Moreover, the exact concept of stability in vitiligo is itself still not transparent and defined beyond doubt Overdependence on KpH or TG may be sometimes misleading in vitiligo. These two reveal the apparent clinical stability only and that may not be the true reflection of stability status of the disease at the molecular level. Antimelanocyte cytotoxic reactivity was observed among CD8+ TCC isolated from perilesional biopsies of patients with vitiligo. An attempt should be made to clearly fathom and define stability, not merely only on clinical ground but along with electron microscopy and histoenzymological analysis of the perilesional and nonlesional skin of vitiligo patients. Probably some growth factors which are responsible for both mitogenic and melanogenic stimulation of melanocytes should also be taken into account. Some serological test(s) could guide us to measure these growth factors.
