Information in the brain is represented and processed by populations of interconnected neurons. However, there is a lack of a clear understanding of the structure and organization of circuit wiring, particularly at the mesoscale which spans multiple columns and layers. In this study, we sought to evaluate whether functional circuit architecture generalizes across the neocortex, testing the existence of a functional analogue to the neocortical microcircuit hypothesis. We analyzed the correlational structure of spontaneous circuit activations in primary auditory, somatosensory, and visual neocortex to generate functional topologies. In these graphs, neurons were represented as nodes, and time-lagged firing between neurons were directed edges. Edge weights reflected how many times the lagged firing occurred and was synonymous to the strength of the functional connection between two neurons. The presence of label-independent features, identified by investigating functional circuit topologies under a graph invariant framework, suggest that functionally distinct areas of the neocortex carry features of a generalized functional cortical circuit. Furthermore, our analyses show that the simultaneous recording of large sections of cortical circuitry is necessary to recognize these features and avoid undersampling errors.
