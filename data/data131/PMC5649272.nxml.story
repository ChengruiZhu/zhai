In the current study, we report a case of a 46-year-old man who presented with sudden abdominal pain and was diagnosed with rupture of hepatic angiosarcoma (HAS). He underwent surgery, but died 13 days after the onset of the abdominal pain. Chronic exposure to carcinogens, such as thorium dioxide, arsenic, vinyl chloride, and radium, is associated with HAS. However, our patient had not been exposed to such carcinogens. He had submitted himself for annual medical checkups since he was employed. His liver was cirrhotic, and medical history data showed that he had had fatty liver for at least 10 years before HAS onset. Although liver cirrhosis may play a role in the occurrence of HAS, the connection of chronic fatty liver in the tumorigenesis remains unclear. Case reports regarding HAS with fatty liver are few. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first case of HAS occurring in a cirrhotic liver that advanced from persistent fatty stage. Given that HAS is a rare tumor, data collection is important for investigating its pathophysiology. Case presentations considering health conditions before HAS onset are limited; therefore, we present a case of HAS with annual health checkup data before disease onset.
