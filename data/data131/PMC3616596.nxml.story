Cranial defects can be caused by injury, infection, or tumor invasion. Large defects should be reconstructed to protect the brain and normalize the cerebral hemodynamics. The conventional method is to cover the defect with bone cement. Custom-made implants designed for the individual patient are now available. We report our experience with one such product in patients with large cranial defects (>7.6 cm in diameter). A CT scan with 2 mm slices and a three-dimensional reconstruction were obtained from the patient. This information was dispatched to the company and used as a template to form the implant. The cranial implant was received within four weeks. From 2005 to 2010, custom-made cranial implants were used in 13 patients with large cranial defects. In 10 of the 13 patients, secondary deep infection was the cause of the cranial defect. All the implants fitted well or very well to the defect. No infections were seen after implantation; however, one patient was reoperated on for an epidural hematoma. A custom-made cranial implant is considerably more expensive than an implant made of bone cement, but ensures that the defect is optimally covered. The use of custom-made implants is straightforward and timesaving, and they provide an excellent medical and cosmetic result.
