The objective of this study was to explore the correlation between bone marrow edema, stage of necrosis, and area ratio of necrosis with the hip pain grading in non-traumatic osteonecrosis of the femoral head. Bone marrow edema grading at all levels and the hip pain grade differences were statistically significant (P < 0.001). Bone marrow edema grading increased by levels of 0, 1, and 2, whereas average pain rating increased as well to 40.73, 104.66 and 143.49. I ~ III period stage of necrosis and the hip pain grade difference was statistically significant (P < 0.001), with the average grade progress pain stage by the death of a rank gradually increased, I period, II period, III period was 57.00, 88.58 and 120.62, respectively. Area ratio of necrosis between 0 ~ 3 were positively correlated with pain, compared the two was statistically significant (P < 0.001), and with the degree of pathological changes is aggravating, increase the average rank of levels of pain. 0, 1, 2 and 3 are 36.88, 98.03, 123.87 and 151.93 respectively. We can choose the treatment method and evaluate treatment effect by considering a patientsâ€™ degree of bone marrow edema, stage of necrosis and area ratio of necrosis.
