The spontaneously diabetic Torii (SDT) rat is of increasing preclinical interest because of its similarities to human type 2 diabetic retinopathy (DR). The system formed by urokinase-type plasminogen activator (uPA) and its receptor (uPAR) is a player in blood-retinal barrier (BRB) breakdown in DR. Here, we investigated whether in SDT rats, preventive administration of UPARANT, an inhibitor of the uPAR pathway, counteracts the retinal impairment in response to chronic hyperglycemia. Electroretinogram (ERG) monitoring was followed over time. Fluorescein-dextran microscopy, CD31 immunohistochemistry, quantitative PCR, ELISA, Evans blue perfusion, and Western blot were also used. UPARANT prevented ERG dysfunction, upregulation of vascular endothelial growth factor and fibroblast growth factor-2, BRB leakage, gliosis, and retinal cell death. The mechanisms underlying UPARANT benefits were studied comparing them with the acute streptozotocin (STZ) model in which UPARANT is known to inhibit DR signs. In SDT rats, but not in the STZ model, UPARANT downregulated the expression of uPAR and its membrane partners. In both models, UPARANT reduced the levels of transcription factors coupled to inflammation or inflammatory factors themselves. These findings may help to establish the uPAR system as putative target for the development of novel drugs that may prevent type 2 DR.
