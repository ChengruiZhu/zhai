The aim of the present study was to assess the clinical relevance of the pre-operative granulocyte/lymphocyte (G/L) ratio as a predictive marker of post-operative complications in patients with colorectal cancer. In total, 85 patients (59 males and 26 females; mean age, 68.9 years) underwent surgery for colorectal cancer at the Department of Surgery, Ibraki Medical Center, Tokyo Medical University (Ami, Japan), and were divided into post-operative complication and non-complication groups. Clinical data, including age, gender, body mass index, tumor localization, tumor pathological type, cancer staging, surgery time, volume of surgical bleeding, pre-operative G/L ratio and further pre-operative laboratory data, including levels of albumin and C-reactive protein, Glasgow Prognostic Score, white blood cell count and levels of hemoglobin, creatine kinase, lactate dehydrogenase, carcinoembryonic antigen and carbohydrate antigen 19-9 were analyzed between these groups. The total post-operative complication rate was 18.8%. On univariate analysis, the amount of surgical bleeding and the pre-operative G/L ratio were significantly higher in the complication group than in the non-complication group (299.8±361.7 vs. 155.6±268.6 ml, P<0.05; and 6.73±10.38 vs. 3.49±2.78, P<0.05, respectively). Multivariate logistic regression analysis for the risk factors of post-operative complications, determined using univariate analysis, demonstrated that the amount of surgical bleeding and the pre-operative G/L ratio were independent risk factors of post-operative complications in patients with colorectal cancer. In conclusion, the G/L ratio may be a clinically relevant pre-operative predictive marker for post-operative complications.
