R-loops (RNA-DNA hybrids) are potentially deleterious for gene expression and genome stability, but can be beneficial, for example, during immunoglobulin gene class-switch recombination. Here we made use of antibody S9.6, with specificity for RNA-DNA duplexes independently of their sequence. The genome-wide distribution of R-loops in wild-type yeast showed association with the highly transcribed ribosomal DNA, and protein-coding genes, particularly the second exon of spliced genes. On RNA polymerase III loci such as the highly transcribed transfer RNA genes (tRNAs), R-loop accumulation was strongly detected in the absence of both ribonucleases H1 and H2 (RNase H1 and H2), indicating that R-loops are inherently formed but rapidly cleared by RNase H. Importantly, stable R-loops lead to reduced synthesis of tRNA precursors in mutants lacking RNase H and DNA topoisomerase activities. RNA-DNA hybrids associated with TY1 cDNA retrotransposition intermediates were elevated in the absence of RNase H, and this was accompanied by increased retrotransposition, in particular to 5â€²-flanking regions of tRNAs. Our findings show that RNase H participates in silencing of TY1 life cycle. Surprisingly, R-loops associated with mitochondrial transcription units were suppressed specifically by RNase H1. These findings have potentially important implications for understanding human diseases caused by mutations in RNase H.
