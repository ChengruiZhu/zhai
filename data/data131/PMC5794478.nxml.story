The aim of this study is to investigate the clinical outcomes of the elderly patients with Non ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) undergoing coronary artery bypass surgery (CABG) compared to non-elderly patients. Patients with NSTEMI and undergoing CABG (n=451) who were registered in the Korea Acute Myocardial Infarction Registry between December 2003 and August 2012 were divided into two groups.; the non-elderly group (<75 years, n=327) and the elderly group (≥75 years, n=124). In-hospital mortality was higher in the elderly group (4.9% vs. 11.3%, p=0.015), but cardiac death, myocardial infarction, and major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) including cardiac death, myocardial infarction, percutaneous revascularization, and redo-CABG after a one-year follow up were not different between the two groups. Predictors of in-hospital mortality in patients with NSTEMI undergoing CABG were left ventricular (LV) dysfunction (ejection fraction ≤40%) [hazard ratio (HR): 2.76, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.16–6.57, p=0.022] and age (HR: 1.05, 95% CI: 1.01–1.10, p=0.047). So elderly NSTEMI patients should be considered for CABG if appropriate, but careful consideration for surgery is required, especially if the patients have severe LV systolic dysfunction.
