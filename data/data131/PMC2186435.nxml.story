Two synergizing antigen-specific helper T (Th) cell populations are required for an optimal TEPC15 (T15)-dominated antiphosphorylcholine (PC) plaque- forming cell response . In these studies, the two Th cell sets are shown to differ in their requirements for recognition of self-major histocompatibility complex (MHC)-encoded determinants by testing the ability of Th cells from F(1) {arrow} parent bone marrow chimeras to collaborate with PC-specific B cells bearing MHC-encoded determinants of either parental haplotypes. Previous studies have shown that one antigen-specific Th cell population is required for T-dependent anti-PC responses and activates PC-specific B cells only if the hapten, PC, is physically linked to the priming antigen. This Th cell, referred to as ThMHC, induces anti-PC responses that are mainly non-T15 in character, and it appears to be identical to the conventional antigen- specific Th cell. In these experiments, using T cells from (A X B)F(1) {arrow} parent A chimeras, ThMHC cells requiring hapten-carrier association provide help for F(1) and parent A B cells but not for B cells from parent B, thus confirming that the activity of the conventional Th cell is H-2 restricted . The second antigen-specific Th cell population, whose function is measured in the presence of the ThMHC cell set, preferentially activates T15-bearing B cells. This Th cell set (ThId) is missing in mice expressing low levels of T15-bearing antibody and can be restored by the addition of antigen-specific T cells from donors expressing high levels of circulating T15 Id. These studies demonstrate that T cells from F(1) {arrow} parent chimeras that express substantial levels of T15-bearing anti-PC antibody could provide ThId cell activity for the selective activation of T15-bearing B cells of F(1) and both parental H-2 types. These results imply that whereas the activity of conventional, ThMHC, cells is clearly H-2 restricted, ThId cells from the same chimeric donors are not required to recognize antigen in association with self-MHC-encoded determinants for successful T-B collaboration .
