As the leading cause of cancer-associated mortality globally among males in 2012, lung cancer is a disease of particular concern. Previously, the neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) and the platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio (PLR) were revealed to be prognostic factors for various types of cancer, including lung cancer. In the present study, a retrospective review was conducted with patients who were diagnosed with lung cancer between January 1, 2000 and December 31, 2005 in the Fourth Hospital of Hebei Medical University. A total of 695 patients were included, and the optimal cutoffs of the NLR and the PLR were 6.0 and 248.0, respectively. There were statistically significant associations between tumor-node-metastasis (TNM) stage, surgery, metastasis incidence and NLR (P<0.001). The associations between TNM stage, surgery incidence and PLR were also revealed to be statistically significant (P<0.001). Patients in the low NLR group demonstrated longer overall survival (OS) than patients in the high NLR group (819.57 days vs. 629.86 days, P=0.041). The NLR at diagnosis was demonstrated to be an independent prognostic factor for OS. Thus, the NLR may be a promising approach for predicting the prognosis of patients with lung cancer.
