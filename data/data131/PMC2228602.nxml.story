Local movement was recorded in tetanically contracting frog sartorius muscle to estimate the nonuniformity in the distribution of compliance in the muscle preparation and the compliance that resides in the attachments of the preparation to the measuring apparatus. The stimulated muscle was also subjected to rapid length changes, and the local movements and tension responses were recorded. The results indicate that during tension development at resting length the central region of the muscle shortens at the expense of the ends. After stimulation the "shoulder" in the tension, which divided the relaxation into a slow decline and a subsequent, rather exponential decay toward zero, was accompanied by an abrupt increase in local movement. We also examined the temperature sensitivity of the two phases of relaxation. The results are consistent with the view that the decrease in tension during relaxation depends on mechanical conditions. The local movement brought about by the imposed length changes indicates that the peak value of the relative length change of the uniformly acting part was approximately 20% less than the relative length change of the whole preparation. From these observations, corrections were obtained for the compliance data derived from the tension responses. These corrections allow a comparison with data in the literature obtained from single fiber preparations. The implications for the stiffness measured during the tension responses are discussed.
