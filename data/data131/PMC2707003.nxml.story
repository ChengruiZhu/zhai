Immune cells survey their local environment and an immunological response can be activated when an appropriate target cell or antigen-presenting cell is recognised by key cell surface molecules. Just how the multitude of proteinâ€“protein interactions work to regulate this decision is an ongoing question. Imaging technology has provided key insights, demonstrating that immune cell activation is often accompanied by the segregation of proteins at immune synapses. Natural killer (NK) cells are lymphocytes that can recognise and kill virally infected or tumour-transformed cells via the formation of a synapse that facilitates secretion of cytotoxic granules directed at the target cells. Key to understanding target cell recognition by NK cells is to establish how the balance of activating and inhibitory signals at the synapse leads to an appropriate response, e.g., to kill or spare a target cell. We found that when activating ligands are dominant on a target cell, NK cells stop migrating and spread lamellipodia across the target cell to form a large symmetrical synapse. If inhibitory signals dominate, the symmetry of the NK cell spreading response is broken and the stop signal is reversed, which reduces the time spent in contact with the target cell. Thus, NK cell activating and inhibitory signals regulate NK cell synapse symmetry and migration to determine whether an NK cell will kill or move on.
