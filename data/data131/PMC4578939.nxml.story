Several non-native proteins require molecular chaperones for proper folding. Many unfolded proteins if not folded accurately, become causal factors in various types of misfolding or aggregation induced diseases such as Alzheimer′s, Huntington′s and several other neurodegenerative disorders. However, structural information of non-folded proteins especially chaperone-dependent proteins is difficult to probe experimentally due to their inherent aggregation propensities. In this work, we study DapA protein, which exhibits obligate requirement on GroEL chaperonin machinery for its folding. We use molecular dynamics simulations to reveal populated intermediate structures of DapA in atomic details. The most plausible intermediate was found to be in agreement with recently reported hydrogen-exchange experimental data. Significant increase in surface exposed hydrophobicity was observed in intermediates compared to native, which was further validated using ANS binding experiments. We also constructed network model of these intermediates that provides remarkable insights into stable hubs (or important residues) underlying diverse states of unfolded proteins. In summary, our work provides a molecular picture of an unfolded protein that is en route to chaperone binding, and these underlying structural properties might act as a molecular signal for their productive folding.
