The quality of people’s lives in Asia has improved markedly since 2nd World War, with developing economies allowing people to pursue multifaceted lives instead of just working to meet basic physical requirements. In the last 30 to 40 years, urbanization in Asia has led to the emergence of urban rail transit (URT) systems in many cities. URT has become a significant part of city life, and the quality of a city’s URT experience has become a significant social issue. This study aims to comprehensively define a quality URT experience in Asian metropolitan cities using a three-pronged comparison of the URTs in three densely populated Asian cities. Both quantitative and qualitative research methods are applied in each of the three aspects studied. The research methods include a case study, a questionnaire, observation, and interviews. The different requirements of diverse groups of users are categorized and a general needs pyramid of a quality URT experience is developed. The multidimensional comparison provides useful references for designers by demonstrating the distinct attitudes of different groups of people. Our understanding of a quality subway experience is based on a needs perspective and focuses on a specific type of public space.
