The aim of the study was to determine the usefulness of interleukin 18 (IL-18) and neutrophil-gelatinase associated lipocalin (NGAL) in the risk assessment of contrast nephropathy in children. The study included patients among whom radiological examinations were performed using intravascular contrast agent. The material consisted of 33 children (19 girls, 14 boys) aged 6.37 ±5.41 years. 20/33 (61%) of patients had hydronephrosis, 9/33 (27%) had other urinary tract defects referred as “no hydronephrosis” and 4/33 (12%) had urolithiasis. NGAL determination was performed with the use of Human Lipocalin-2 / NGAL Immunoassay. To determine the concentration of human IL-18 an ELISA Kit (MBL International Corporation) was used. There were no statistically significant differences in the concentrations of NGAL and IL-18 in serum determined before the procedure, and after the administration of contrast agent. Concentrations of NGAL and IL-18 were determined in urine three times: before the procedure, 2-4 hours after administration of the contrast agent, and 48 hours after the performed procedure. The analysis showed that the concentration of IL-18 and NGAL in urine did not differ significantly in three consecutive preformed measurements. The study has also found no statistically significant differences between serum creatinine before and 48 hours after injection of contrast. Implementation of new biomarkers such as NGAL and IL-18 expands the possibilities of renal function assessment in children undergoing radiological procedures using contrast agents. In examined children with normal or slightly impaired renal function they did not demonstrate the risk of contrast nephropathy.
