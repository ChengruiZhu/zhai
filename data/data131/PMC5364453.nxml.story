The
cell membrane is a barrier to the passive diffusion of charged molecules
due to the chemical properties of the lipid bilayer. Surprisingly,
recent experiments have identified processes in which synthetic and
biological charged species directly transfer across lipid bilayers
on biologically relevant time scales. In particular, amphiphilic nanoparticles
have been shown to insert into lipid bilayers, requiring the transport
of charged species across the bilayer. The molecular factors facilitating
this rapid insertion process remain unknown. In this work, we use
atomistic molecular dynamics simulations to calculate the free energy
barrier associated with “flipping” charged species across
a lipid bilayer for species that are grafted to a membrane-embedded
scaffold, such as a membrane-embedded nanoparticle. We find that the
free energy barrier for flipping a grafted ligand can be over 7 kcal/mol
lower than the barrier for translocating an isolated, equivalent ion,
yielding a 5 order of magnitude decrease in the corresponding flipping
time scale. Similar results are found for flipping charged species
grafted to either nanoparticle or protein scaffolds. These results
reveal new mechanistic insight into the flipping of charged macromolecular
components that might play an important, yet overlooked, role in signaling
and charge transport in biological settings. Furthermore, our results
suggest guidelines for the design of synthetic materials capable of
rapidly flipping charged moieties across the cell membrane.
