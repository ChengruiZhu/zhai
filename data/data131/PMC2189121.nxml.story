We have analyzed the nature and kinetics of a delayed, cell-mediated immune response to a purified protein derivative of tuberculin (PPD) in the skin of 154 naturally sensitized patients with lepromatous leprosy. After the intradermal injection of 5 U of PPD, biopsies were taken at 1- 21 d and studied for the composition, extent, persistence, and organization of the emigratory cell response by light and electron microscopy. Induration of positive sites occurred promptly, reached a maximum diameter at 4 d, displayed a major extravasatory element, and was evident for as long as 21 d. The cellularity of the site exhibited a biphasic course, reached a maximum at 7 d, involved as much as 70% of the dermis and millions of new cells, and was elevated threefold above preinjection levels at 21 d. The emigratory cells were limited to T cells and circulating monocytes. T cells were more evident as they entered a preexisting lepromatous lesion containing parasitized macrophages and only occasional T cells many of the CD8+ phenotype. The predominant emigratory T cell was CD4+ although CD8+ cells were in evidence. The CD4/CD8 ratio of the lesions started at less than unity and in two distinct steps reached levels as high as 5:1. In most sites CD4+ cells were in the majority at 21 d. A well-defined granulomatous response with epithelioid and giant cells was apparent at 4 d, reached a maximum at 7 d, and involved all PPD sites at this time point. The generation of these differentiated mononuclear phagocytes from newly emigrated monocytes was never observed in the underlying lepromatous lesion but is a constant feature of the tuberculoid leprosy response. Epidermal thickening and keratinocyte proliferation, sequellae of the dermal reaction, reached a maximum at 7 d and gradually resolved by 3 wk. A constant feature of the PPD response was the extensive destruction of preexisting macrophages containing Mycobacterium leprae bacilli or their products. This was associated with the presence of and intimate contact with highly polarized lymphoid cells of unknown phenotype. Cell destruction did not involve other elements of the dermis and spared parasitized Schwann cells. Newly emigrated T cells and monocytes were never seen within the perineural sheath in contact with neural elements. It appears that a single antigenic stimulus leads to a very long-term, defined series of events with distinct temporal patterns. It includes waves of emigratory T cells, the maturation and organization of monocytes, the generation of killer cells, and the extensive destruction of parasitized macrophages.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)
