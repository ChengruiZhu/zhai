Gene regulatory networks describing related biological processes are thought to share conserved interaction structure. This assumption motivates a great deal of work in model systems–where discovery of gene regulation may be more experimentally tractable–but is difficult to directly evaluate using existing methods. The presence of shared structure in a well studied model system or process should make the problem of network inference in a related process easier, but this information is not often applied to the discovery of global gene regulatory networks. Further, to be able to successfully translate findings between different organisms, it is important to be able to identify where regulatory structure is different. We provide a method based on penalized fused regression for inferring gene regulatory networks given prior knowledge about the similarity of interactions in each network. This method is demonstrated on synthetic data, and applied to the problem of inferring networks in distantly related bacterial organisms. We then introduce an extension of the method to deal with the condition of uncertainty over the degree of regulatory conservation by simultaneously inferring gene conservation and interaction weights.
