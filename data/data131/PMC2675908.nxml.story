ATP is not only a source of intracellular energy but can act as an intercellular signal by binding membrane receptors. Purinergic receptors, which bind with nucleotides including ATP are known as P2 receptors and are divided into two types: ion channel-type P2X receptors and metabotropic-type P2Y receptors. P2X receptors are thought to undergo conformational changes in response to ATP binding, leading to the opening of transmembrane channels, through which cations enter the cells. A growing body of evidence shows that P2X receptors control various physiological and pathophysiological cellular responses. However, the receptor structure and the conformational changes it experiences upon stimulation remained to be clarified. Here, we employed an atomic force microscope (AFM) to observe P2X receptor behavior at the single channel level. We chose to analyze the P2X4 receptor, because it is known to increase the transmembrane pore size (i.e., pore dilation) in the absence of extracellular calcium. Activated P2X4 receptor exhibited a trimeric topology with a pore-like structure in the center. When calcium was present the receptor exhibited a trimer without a pore structure at its center. These structural changes corresponded well with the changes of ion permeability of P2X4 receptor.
