 (Aa), both induce a time and concentration-dependent expression and secretion of interleukin 8 (IL-8), tumour necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1) by cultured human peripheral blood-derived mast cells, but not anti-inflammatory molecules, such as IL-10 or transforming growth factor β1 (TGF-β1). The IL-8 and MCP-1 responses were immediate, whereas the onset of TNF-α secretion was delayed. The Cpn-mediated pro-inflammatory effect was attenuated when the bacteria were inactivated by UV-treatment. Human monocyte-derived macrophages that were pre-infected with Cpn also induced a significant pro-inflammatory response in human mast cells, both in cocultures and when preconditioned media from Cpn-infected macrophages were used. Intranasal and intravenous administration of live Cpn and Aa, respectively induced an accumulation of activated mast cells in the aortic sinus of apolipoprotein E-deficient mice, however, with varying responses in the systemic levels of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and TNF-α. Pro-atherogenic Cpn and Aa induce a pro-inflammatory response in cultured human connective tissue-type mast cells and activation of mouse aortic mast cells
