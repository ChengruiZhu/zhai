Receptors of effector T lymphocytes of congeneic strains of mice do not recognize public H-2 specificities and react to private H-2 specificities only. This has been established with the use of three tests: direct cytotoxicity assay of immune lymphocytes upon target cells, specific absorption of the lymphocytes on the target cells, and rejection of skin grafts at an accelerated fashion. Immunization with two private H-2 specificities in the system C57BL/10ScSn leads to B10.D2 induces formation of two corresponding populations of effector lymphocytes in unequal proportion: a greater part of them is directed against the private specificity H-2.33 (Kb), while the smaller part is towards H-2.2 (Db) private specificity. These two populations of effector lymphocytes do not overlap, as demonstrated by experiments on their cross-absorption on B10.D2 (R107), B10.D2 (R101), B10.A(2R), and B10.A(5R) target cells, as well as on mixtures of R107 and R101 targets. Following removal of lymphocytes reacting with one of the private H-2 specificities, lymphocytes specific to the other specificity are fully maintained. A mixture of target cells, each bearing one of the two immunizing private specificities, absorbs 100% of the immune lymphocytes and is totally destroyed by them. It is suggested that H-2 antigens are natural complexes of hapten-carrier type, in which the role of hapten is played by public H-2 specifities and that of the carrier determinant by either private H-2 specificities or structures closely linked to them. Various models of steric arrangement of MHC determinants recognized by receptors of effector T lymphocytes are discussed.
