Developing pea cotyledons contain functionally different vacuoles, a protein storage vacuole and a lytic vacuole. Lumenal as well as membrane proteins of the protein storage vacuole exit the Golgi apparatus in dense vesicles rather than in clathrin-coated vesicles (CCVs). Although the sorting receptor for vacuolar hydrolases BP-80 is present in CCVs, it is not detectable in dense vesicles. To localize these different vacuolar sorting events in the Golgi, we have compared the distribution of vacuolar storage proteins and of Î±-TIP, a membrane protein of the protein storage vacuole, with the distribution of the vacuolar sorting receptor BP-80 across the Golgi stack. Analysis of immunogold labeling from cryosections and from high pressure frozen samples has revealed a steep gradient in the distribution of the storage proteins within the Golgi stack. Intense labeling for storage proteins was registered for the cis-cisternae, contrasting with very low labeling for these antigens in the trans-cisternae. The distribution of BP-80 was the reverse, showing a peak in the trans-Golgi network with very low labeling of the cis-cisternae. These results indicate a spatial separation of different vacuolar sorting events in the Golgi apparatus of developing pea cotyledons.
