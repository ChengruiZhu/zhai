Sprouting angiogenesis—a process by which new blood vessels grow from existing ones—is an ubiquitous phenomenon in health and disease of higher organisms, playing a crucial role in organogenesis, wound healing, inflammation, as well as on the onset and progression of over 50 different diseases such as cancer, rheumatoid arthritis and diabetes. Mathematical models have the ability to suggest relevant hypotheses with respect to the mechanisms of cell movement and rearrangement within growing vessel sprouts. The inclusion of both biochemical and mechanical processes in a mathematical model of sprouting angiogenesis permits to describe sprout extension as a function of the forces exerted by the cells in the tissue. It also allows to question the regulation of biochemical processes by mechanical forces and vice-versa. In this work we present a compact model of sprouting angiogenesis that includes the mechanical characteristics of the vessel and the tissue. We use this model to suggest the mechanism for the regulation of proliferation within sprout formation. We conclude that the tip cell has the role of creating a tension in the cells that follow its lead. On those first cells of the stalk, this tension produces strain and/or empty spaces, inevitably triggering cell proliferation. The new cells occupy the space behind the tip, the tension decreases, and the process restarts. The modelling strategy used, deemed phase-field, permits to describe the evolution of the shape of different domains in complex systems. It is focused on the movement of the interfaces between the domains, and not on an exhaustive description of the transport properties within each domain. For this reason, it requires a reduced number of parameters, and has been used extensively in modelling other biological phenomena such as tumor growth. The coupling of mechanical and biochemical processes in a compact mathematical model of angiogenesis will enable the study of lumen formation and aneurisms in the near future. Also, this framework will allow the study of the action of flow in vessel remodelling, since local forces can readily be coupled with cell movement to obtain the final vessel morphology.
