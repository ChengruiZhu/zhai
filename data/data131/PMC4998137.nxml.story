As advances in the medical field have resulted in increased life expectancy, performing surgery under general anesthesia in elderly patients has become an important issue. A 99-year-old Okinawan female was admitted to the hospital presenting with pain in the tongue. Following physical examination, a clinical diagnosis of early stage tongue cancer (T2N0Mx) was confirmed. Early stage tongue cancer is particularly easy to access for surgical resection. By contrast, later stages of tongue cancer are associated with pain, dysphagia and throat obstruction. The patient and their family agreed to surgery due to the worsening pain associated with the tumor and gave informed consent for surgery. Following consultation with a cardiologist and an anesthesiologist, the tongue tumor was surgically resected under general anesthesia. Subsequent to surgery, the patient experienced pain relief and was discharged from the hospital on day 14 post-surgery. The patient was able to maintain the same quality of life, and lived for 5 years and 2 months longer without evidence of disease, surviving to the age of 104 years old. The present case demonstrates that surgery under general anesthesia may be appropriate in patients of an advanced age, with a treatment plan that should ideally be based on careful assessment of the wishes of the patient and their family, medical risks, and benefits and economic costs of alternative treatments, in addition to consideration of the patient's culture.
