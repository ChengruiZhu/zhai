Gene transcription can be regulated through multiple mechanisms, such as histone modifications that create structural changes of the chromatin leading to gene activation or suppression, or regulation of the 3â€™ cleavage site of the mRNA, known as alternative cleavage and polyadenylation (APA), resulting in the generation of transcript isoforms with various lengths. Here we present genome-wide subunit-specific roles of the PAF complex (Paf1C) related to both mechanisms of transcriptional regulation. Using mouse muscle cells, we show contrasting results with yeast, namely, that depletion of Paf1C subunits does not affect certain histone modifications previously associated with this complex and that the complex exhibits subunit-specific functions. We also discovered a novel role of Paf1C in APA, wherein genome-wide transcript shortening occurs after depletion of three of the subunits. However, APA varies after depletion of certain subunits, reinforcing our conclusions regarding subunit specificity. Furthermore, by comparing depletions of two subunits, we show that the accumulation of RNA polymerase II (PolII) near the transcription start site (TSS) is specifically associated with the activation of TSS-proximal pA sites observed in one depletion but not the other.
