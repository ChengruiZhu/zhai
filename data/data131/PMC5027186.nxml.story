Effects of myostatin (MSTN)-suppression on the regeneration of injured skeletal muscle under unloading condition were investigated by using transgenic mice expressing a dominant-negative form of MSTN (MSTN-DN). Both MSTN-DN and wild-type (WT) mice were subjected to continuous hindlimb suspension (HS) for 6 weeks. Cardiotoxin (CTX) was injected into left soleus muscle under anesthesia 2 weeks after the initiation of HS. Then, the soleus muscles were excised following 6-week HS (4 weeks after CTX-injection). CTX-injection caused to reduce the soleus fiber cross-sectional area (CSA) in WT mice under both unloading and weight-bearing conditions, but not in MSTN-DN mice. Under unloading condition, CTX-injected muscle weight and fiber CSA in MSTN-DN mice were significantly higher than those in WT mice. CTX-injected muscle had many damaged and regenerating fibers having central nuclei in both WT and MSTN-DN mice. Significant increase in the population of Pax7-positive nuclei in CTX-injected muscle was observed in MSTN-DN mice, but not in WT mice. Evidences indicate that the suppression of MSTN cause to increase the regenerative potential of injured soleus muscle via the increase in the population of muscle satellite cells regardless of unloading conditions.
