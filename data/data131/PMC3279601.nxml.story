UV radiation targets the skin and is a primary cause of skin cancer (both melanoma and non-melanoma skin cancer). Exposure to UV also suppresses the immune response, and UV-induced immune suppression is a major risk factor for skin cancer induction. The efforts of Dermatologists and Cancer Biologists to understand how UV exposure suppresses the immune response and contributes to skin cancer induction led to the development of the sub-discipline we call photoimmunology. Advances in photoimmunology have generally paralleled advances in immunology. However, there are a number of examples where investigations into the mechanisms underlying UV-induced immune suppression reshaped our understanding of basic immunological concepts. Unconventional immune regulatory roles for Langerhans cells, mast cells, and NKT cells as well as the immune suppressive function of lipid mediators of inflammation and alarmins, are just some examples of how advances in immunodermatology have altered our understanding of basic immunology. In this anniversary issue celebrating 75 years of Cutaneous Science, we will provide examples of how concepts that grew out of efforts by Immunologists and Dermatologists to understand immune regulation by UV radiation impacted on immunology in general.
