Observational studies have reported that the low levels of serum 25OHD and serum vitamin D binding protein (DBP, a key determinant of serum 25OHD level) are both associated with the risk of several common diseases and traits. Such studies have implicated vitamin D deficiency in cardiometabolic disease (cardiovascular diseases that affect the heart and/or blood vessels and metabolic diseases that affect the cellular chemical reactions needed to sustain life), in some cancers, and in Alzheimer disease. But observational studies cannot prove that vitamin D deficiency or DBP levels actually cause any of these diseases. So, for example, an observational study might report an association between vitamin D deficiency and type 2 diabetes (a metabolic disease), but the individuals who develop type 2 diabetes might share another unknown characteristic that is actually responsible for disease development (a confounding factor). Alternatively, type 2 diabetes might reduce circulating vitamin D levels (reverse causation). Here, the researchers undertake a Mendelian randomization study to determine whether circulating DBP levels have causal effects on calcemic and cardiometabolic diseases. In Mendelian randomization, causality is inferred from associations between genetic variants that mimic the influence of a modifiable environmental exposure and the outcome of interest. Because gene variants are inherited randomly, they are not prone to confounding and are free from reverse causation. So, if low DBP levels lead to low serum 25OHD levels, and vitamin D levels have a causal effect on common diseases, genetic variants associated with low DBP levels should be associated with the development of common diseases.
