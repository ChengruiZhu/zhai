Metastatic cardiac tumors are more common than the primary cardiac tumors. Cervical cancer metastasizing outside of the pelvis is commonly spread to the lungs, liver, bones and lymph nodes than to the heart. Right-sided metastasis to the heart is more common than to the left side. Intramural spread is more common than intracavitary growth of metastatic cardiac tumors leading to delayed clinical presentation. Intracavitary mass can be confused with intracavitary thrombus which can be seen in the setting of pulmonary embolism. Transthoracic echocardiography plays a major role in the decision making and management of pulmonary embolism, and this modality can also be used to diagnose cardiac masses. Other modalities like TEE, cardiac CT, cardiac MRI and PET-CT scan have further utility in delineating these masses. This may help to plan appropriate management of the right ventricular mass particularly in cases where the patient history and CT pulmonary angiography results favor the diagnosis of pulmonary embolism. We present the case of a 49-year-old woman with a history of supracervical hysterectomy and salpingo-oophorectomy on oral estrogen therapy who was admitted with complaints of pleuritic chest pain and respiratory insufficiency after a long flight. Initial work-up showed sub-segmental pulmonary embolus in the right posterior lower lobe pulmonary artery, and the patient was managed on intravenous heparin. Lack of appropriate response to standard therapy led to further evaluation. Multimodality imaging and biopsies revealed a large right intracavitary ventricular metastatic squamous cell tumor, with the cervix as the primary source.
