Allelic imbalance, or a deviation from the expected 1-to-1 ratio of alleles where both were present in the germline, can result when there has been an acquired deletion or duplication of part of a chromosome and is a hallmark of cancer genomes. Tumor genomic profiling studies often involve analysis of samples that contain aberrant tumor cells mixed with normal cells without these acquired mutations. Methods for detecting chromosomal aberrations that result in allelic imbalance within a heterogeneous sample have previously been proposed that use the dispersion of within-sample allele frequencies measured at germline heterozygous positions. Here we demonstrate that combining this information with a measure for the correlation in these dispersions, due to the imbalance of one of the chromosomes, provides the most powerful approach. Our method allows for sensitive identification of short allelic imbalance events (e.g. 10 Mb) contained in as few as 3% of the cells in a heterogeneous mixture. Applications include profiling tumor genomes following surgical resection where there exists high contamination of normal tissue and identifying aberrations in subclones. Our work provides a framework for further development of methods that use observed data and population genetic theory for inference of allelic imbalance.
