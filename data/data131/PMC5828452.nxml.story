Pain is an evolutionarily conserved physiological phenomenon necessary for survival. Yet, pain can become pathological when it occurs independently of noxious stimuli. The molecular mechanisms of pathological pain are still poorly understood, limiting the development of highly needed novel analgesics. Recently, genetic variations in the genomic region encoding FAM173B—a functionally uncharacterized protein—have been linked to chronic pain in humans. In this study, we identify the role and function of FAM173B in the development of pathological pain. We used genetic, biochemical, and behavioral approaches in mice to show that FAM173B is a mitochondrial lysine methyltransferase—a protein that transfers methyl group to donor proteins. By genetically silencing or overexpressing FAM173B in sensory neurons, we showed that FAM173B methyltransferase activity promotes the development of chronic pain. In addition, we discovered that FAM173B methyltransferase activity in the mitochondria of sensory neurons promotes chronic pain via a pathway that depends on the production of reactive oxygen species and on the engagement of spinal cord microglia—engulfing cells of the central nervous system. These data point to an essential role of FAM173B in the regulation of pathological pain.
