VEGF gene has been reported to be related with many diseases and recurrent pregnancy loss in various studies. Concerning the role of VEGF polymorphisms in pregnancy losses, generally mothers genotypes have been analyzed. To evaluate the association between VEGF A +405G/C (rs2010963), âˆ’460T/C (rs833061), +936C/T (rs3025039) and - 2578A/C (rs699947) polymorphisms and spontaneous abortion, we studied the genotypes of spontaneously aborted fetuses, their mothers and healthy controls. 23 spontaneously aborted fetal materials, 22 mothers who had these abortions and 86 healthy controls were included in this study. rs2010963, rs833061, rs3025039 and rs699947 polymorphisms were analyzed by Real Time PCR technique after genomic DNA isolation from all subjects. The frequencies of VEGF A rs2010963 GG genotype and rs2010963 G allele were higher in fetuses compared both with mothers and healthy controls. VEGF A rs3025039 TT genotype and rs3025039 T allele frequencies were higher in fetuses comparing with mothers. VEGF A rs833061 CT and TT genotypes frequencies were higher in fetuses comparing with mothers. We ascertained that VEGF A rs2010963, rs833061 and rs3025039 are the risk factors for spontaneous abortion in fetal genotypes comparing with their mothers and healthy controls.
