Intraosseous vascular lesions are rare lesions, accounting for 0.5-1% of all intraosseous tumors. They were found to be affecting the second decade of life, more frequent in women. The frequency found affecting the vertebral column and skull; the mandible is a quite rare location. At present, according to the World Health Organization, these lesions are now considered as benign vasoformative neoplasms of endothelial origin. However, the origin of the central hemangioma is debatable. Some authors state it as a true neoplasm, few state it is a hamartoma. On examination, the patient may or may not show any symptoms, some present discomfort, blood discharge, bluish discoloration, mobility of the teeth. The radiographic finding is a multilocular radiolucenies with classic honeycombs or soap bubble appearance. Differential diagnosis includes odontogenic lesions like ameloblastoma, cystic lesions such as residual cyst, central giant cell tumor, fibrous dysplasia. The wide surgical excision along with the reconstruction is choice of treatment of hemangioma. We present a case report of a 24-year-old female diagnosed with intraosseous mandibular hemangioma and surgical reconstruction of mandible with rib graft.
