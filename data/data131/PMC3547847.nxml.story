), is one of many post-translational modifications that occur on proteins. Such modifications can, in turn, affect numerous aspects of a protein, notably cellular localization, turnover, activity, and molecular interactions. In addition to post-translational modifications, the structural organization of a protein or protein complex can also have a significant impact on its function and stability. A group of factors known as “molecular chaperones” aid newly synthesized proteins in reaching their native conformation or alternating between physiologically relevant states. We present here a new family of factors that promote methylation of chaperones and show that, at least in one case, this modification translates into a modulation in the activity of the substrate chaperone. Our results not only characterize the function of previously unknown gene products, uncover a new role for protein methylation as a regulatory pathway for chaperones, and define a novel regulatory mechanism for the chaperone VCP, whose deregulation is causative of neuromuscular diseases, but also suggest the existence of a post-translational modification code that regulates molecular chaperones. Further decrypting this “chaperone code” will help understanding how the functional organization of the proteome is orchestrated.
