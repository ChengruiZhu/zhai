Energy ratings have been used as a marker of exercise readiness (i.e. pre-exercise physical/mental state indicating ability to perform) within flexible nonlinear periodization (FNLP)-based resistance training interventions. However, empirical data is lacking regarding the utility of this approach for aerobic exercise. The purpose of this study was to examine the ability of pre-exercise energy level to predict affective and behavioral responses to prescribed aerobic exercise. Participants consisted of 19 women and 8 men (N=27, age=20±4 years, estimated maximal oxygen uptake=37±6). Participants performed two 30-min bouts of treadmill exercise under an imposed moderate intensity (70–75% of age-predicted maximal heart rate; %HRmax) condition and a self-selected intensity condition. Pre-exercise energy level was assessed using the Energy Index (EI) score derived from the Profile of Mood States. Feeling Scale (FS) was the dependent variable in the imposed bout and average intensity (%HRmax) was the dependent variable during the self-selected bout. Multiple regression analyses were used to determine if EI predicted mean FS and %HRmax. After controlling for potential confounders, EI significantly predicted mean FS (β=.499, p=.037) during imposed exercise. No significant relationship existed between EI and overall intensity (β =−121, p=.554) during self-selected exercise. While EI predicted in-task core affect it was unrelated to self-selected intensity. It is premature to suggest EI as an optimal predictor of exercise readiness in regards to aerobic exercise for aerobically untrained young adults. More research is needed to determine an evidence-based marker of readiness that can be used for aerobic exercise prescribed within the context of FNLP.
