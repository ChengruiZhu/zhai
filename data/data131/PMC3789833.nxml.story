The complex organization of tissues is established precisely and reproducibly during development. In the vertebrate neural tube, as in many other tissues, the interplay between extrinsic morphogens and intrinsic transcription factors produces spatial patterns of gene expression that delineate precursors for specific cell types. One such transcription factor, Pax3, defines the precursors of all sensory neuron subtypes and distinguishes them from precursors fated to give rise to the motor circuits. To gain insight into the molecular mechanisms by which the spinal cord is segregated into these two functional domains, we analysed the genomic regulatory sequences responsible for controlling Pax3 activity. We identified two regions of the genome, the coordinated activity of which establishes and refines Pax3 activity. We showed that the combination of activating signals from secreted Wnt factors together with Nkx family homeodomain repressors restrict Pax3 activity to the presumptive sensory region of the neural tissue. Subsequently, Pax3 acts to directly potentiate its own transcription and this autoregulation sustains Pax3 expression at later developmental stages. Together, our study reveals the way in which intrinsic and extrinsic signals are integrated by cells and converted into a sustained pattern of gene activity in the developing nervous system.
