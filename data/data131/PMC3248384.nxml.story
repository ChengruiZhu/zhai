The combination of distinct drugs in combinatorial therapy can help to improve therapeutic efficacy by overcoming the redundancy and robustness of pathogenic processes, or by lowering the risk of side effects. However, identification of effective drug combinations is cumbersome, considering the possible search space with respect to the large number of drugs that could potentially be combined. In this work, we explore various molecular and pharmacological features of drugs, and show that by utilizing combinations of such features it is possible to predict new drug combinations. Benchmarking the approach using approved drug combinations demonstrates that these feature combinations are indeed predictive and can propose promising new drug combinations. In addition, the enriched feature patterns provide insights into the mechanisms underlying drug combinations. For example, they suggest that if two drugs share targets or therapeutic effects, they can be independently combined with a third common drug. The ability to efficiently predict drug combinations should facilitate the development of more efficient drug therapies for a broader range of indications including hard-to-treat complex diseases.
