Fat build up in liver is known to increase the likelihood of developing numerous health problems around the body including cardiovascular problems, desensitisation to the hormone insulin leading to type 2 diabetes, and the development of fibrous tissue in liver (fibrosis) resulting in loss of liver function (cirrhosis). Liver cells show marked differences in their metabolism depending upon their position along liver capillaries (sinusoids). It has been shown previously that cells nearer the output end of the sinusoid (pericentral) are more susceptible to excess fat and the resulting damage than those near the input end. However, due to the micro-meter scale of the sinusoids and the large number of potential variables, it is difficult to study metabolism in individual regions of the sinusoid experimentally when considering various feeding and disease states. Here, a computational model of sinusoidal metabolism incorporating previously measured differences in enzyme activities across the sinusoid is presented and used to assess the key metabolic differences leading to pericentral susceptibility to excess fat build-up. Secondly, the model is used to assess the metabolic variations between individuals most likely to account for inter-individual variability in susceptibility to excess liver fat and its predominant location. These simulations will aid understanding of disease progression and allow for more targeted future experimental work.
