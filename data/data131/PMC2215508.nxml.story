A series of n-alkyl-bis-alpha,omega-trimethylammonium (bisQn) compounds was synthesized, and their ability to block K+ currents through a K+ channel from sarcoplasmic reticulum was studied. K+ channels were inserted into planar phospholipid membranes, and single-channel K+ currents were measured in the presence of the blocking cations. These bisQn compounds block K+ currents only from the side of the membrane opposite to the addition of SR vesicles (the trans side). The block is dependent on transmembrane voltage, and the effective valence of the block (a measure of this voltage dependence) varies with the methylene chain length. For short chains (bisQ2-bisQ5), the effective valence decreases with chain length from 1.1 to 0.65; it then remains constant at approximately 0.65 for bisQ5 to bisQ8; the effective valence abruptly increases to 1.2-1.3 for chains of nine carbons and longer. For the compounds of nine carbons and longer, the discrete nature of the block can be observed directly as 'flickering noise" on the open channel. The kinetics of the block were studied for these long-chain blockers. Both blocking and unblocking rates of the blockers vary with chain length, with the blocking rate showing the strongest variation-- an increase of 2.8-fold per added methylene group. All of the voltage dependence of the binding equilibrium resides in the blocking rate, and none in the unblocking rate. The results imply that 65% of the voltage drop within the channel occurs over a distance of 6-7A, and that the short-chain blockers bind in a bent-over conformation with both charges deeply inside the channel.
