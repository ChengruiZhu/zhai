Every cell contains a complete copy of the genome, which is comprised of DNA. To fit the genome into the cell nucleus, DNA strands are wound around spools made of proteins called histones. By packing DNA, histones also control access to DNA, which influences when genes can be turned on and off. The authors present two main findings. First, they demonstrate a new, simple method to determine how tightly genes are wrapped around histones. Second, they use the new method to determine what happens to DNA packaging at every gene through one cycle of cell growth and division. They find that as genes get turned on throughout the cell cycle, the packaging of DNA that controls those genes becomes loose, and as genes get turned off, it becomes tight again. However, some cell cycle–regulated genes do not fit this pattern, suggesting another means of regulation for these genes. Interestingly, cell cycle–related differences in packaging at single genes are smaller than differences in packaging that are always apparent between different groups of genes. This suggests that most differences in how DNA is packaged may be controlled by the sequence of DNA itself, with smaller contributions from other factors.
