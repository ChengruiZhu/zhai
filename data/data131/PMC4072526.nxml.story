In many biological disciplines, computational modeling of interaction networks is the key for understanding biological phenomena. Such networks are traditionally studied using deterministic models. However, it has been recently recognized that when the populations are small in size, the inherent random effects become significant and to incorporate them, a stochastic modeling paradigm is necessary. Hence, stochastic models of reaction networks have been broadly adopted and extensively used. Such models, for instance, form a cornerstone for studying heterogeneity in clonal cell populations. In biological applications, one is often interested in knowing the long-term behavior and stability properties of reaction networks even with incomplete knowledge of the model parameters. However for stochastic models, no analytical tools are known for this purpose, forcing many researchers to use a simulation-based approach, which is highly unsatisfactory. To address this issue, we develop a theoretical and computational framework for determining the long-term behavior and stability properties for stochastic reaction networks. Our approach is based on a mixture of ideas from probability theory, linear algebra and optimization theory. We illustrate the broad applicability of our results by considering examples from various biological areas. The biological implications of our results are discussed as well.
