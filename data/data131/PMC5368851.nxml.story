The goal of this study is to evaluate therapeutic trends for several diseases that represent risk factors for stroke. The relative frequency of therapy with compounds that influence the risk factors for stroke was monitored in a group of 3,290 patients who were hospitalised in the Stroke Unit at the University Hospital in Hradec Kralove between 2005 and 2012. For most drugs monitored, the reasons for the significant decrease or increase in use were causes other than the reduction of stroke risk. Despite this finding, the majority of statistically significant changes had, according to review of comparative studies, a positive effect on prevention of stroke. Motivation to change treatment of stroke risk factors, such as hypertension, diabetes mellitus and hypercholesterolemia, was mainly aimed at sufficient disease management with a minimum of adverse effects. On the other hand, optimization of stroke recurrence and economic factors were motivations to treatment changes in prevention with antiplatelets. Antidiabetics were associated with an increase in metformin use and reduction in insulin use. For antihypertensives, the most significant reduction was associated with the use of diuretics, although calcium channel blockers and beta-blockers are also less used. Additionally, the use of the ACE inhibitor ramipril increased
