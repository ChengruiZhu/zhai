The approach to the surgical treatment of lateral oral cavity and oro-pharyngeal cancer has undergone many changes over the years, passing
from a demolitive approach involving segmental resectioning of the mandible to a conservative approach with temporary mandibulotomy.
The complications resulting from these two different approaches invited further review of the various indications related to them. The
present report considers, through a retrospective analysis, whether the sub-mandibular approach, which envisages the use of the harmonic
instrument, is an oncologically correct alternative and whether it actually reduces the number of early and late complications. From 2003
to 2009, 259 patients underwent surgery for lateral oral cavity and oro-pharyngeal cancer. A sub-mandibular approach was used in 163
patients, and a conservative trans-mandibular approach in 12. The results showed that the number of late complications and T recurrences
was significantly lower in those patients in whom the sub-mandibular approach was carried out. There was no difference in the microscopic
examination of the resection margins. The use of the harmonic instrument made it possible to perform "en bloc" (T+N) operations working
in narrow spaces with less intra-operative bleeding, which contributed to adequate oncological radicality.
