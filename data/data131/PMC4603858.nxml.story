Preimplantation genetic diagnosis (PGD) is well established method for treatment of genetic problems associated with infertility. Moreover, PGD with next-generation sequencing (NGS) provide new possibilities for diagnosis and new parameters for evaluation in, for example, aneuploidy screening. The aim of the study was to report the successful pregnancy outcome following PGD with NGS as the method for 24 chromosome aneuploidy screening in the case of Robertsonian translocation. Day 3 embryos screening for chromosomal aneuploidy was performed in two consecutive in vitro fertilization (IVF) cycles, first with fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH), and then with NGS-based protocol. In each IVF attempt, three embryos were biopsied. Short duration of procedures enabled fresh embryo transfer without the need for vitrification. First IVF cycle with the embryo selected using PGD analysis with the FISH method ended with pregnancy loss in week 8. The second attempt with NGS-based aneuploidy screening led to exclusion of the following two embryos: one embryo with 22 monosomy and one with multiple aneuploidies. The transfer of the only euploid blastocyst resulted in the successful pregnancy outcome. The identification of the euploid embryo based on the NGS application was the first successful clinical application of NGS-based PGD in the case of the Robertsonian translocation carrier couple.
