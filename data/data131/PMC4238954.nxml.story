Traditionally, sensory neuroscience has focused on correlating inputs from the physical world with the response of a single neuron. Two stimuli can be distinguished solely from the response of one neuron if one stimulus elicits a response and the other does not. But as soon as one departs from extremely simple stimuli, single-cell coding becomes less effective, because cells often respond weakly and unreliably. High fidelity coding then relies upon populations of cells, and correlation among those cells can greatly affect the neural code. While previous theoretical studies have demonstrated a potential coding advantage of correlation, they allowed only a marginal improvement in coding power. Here, we present a scenario in which a pattern of correlation among neurons in a population yields an improvement in coding performance by several orders of magnitude. By “improvement” we mean that a neural population is much better at both distinguishing stimuli and at encoding a large number of them. The scenario we propose does not invoke unrealistic values of correlation. What is more, it is even effective for small neural populations and in subtle cases in which single-cell coding fails utterly. These results demonstrate a previously unappreciated potential for correlated population coding.
