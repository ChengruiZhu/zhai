Subcortical small-vessel disease (SSVD) is a disorder well characterized from the clinical, imaging, and neuropathological viewpoints. SSVD is considered the most prevalent ischemic brain disorder, increasing in frequency with age. Vascular risk factors include hypertension, diabetes, hyperlipidemia, elevated homocysteine, and obstructive sleep apnea. Ischemic white matter lesions are the hallmark of SSVD; other pathological lesions include arteriolosclerosis, dilatation of perivascular spaces, venous collagenosis, cerebral amyloid angiopathy, microbleeds, microinfarcts, lacunes, and large infarcts. The pathogenesis of SSVD is incompletely understood but includes endothelial changes and blood-brain barrier alterations involving metalloproteinases, vascular endothelial growth factors, angiotensin II, mindin/spondin, and the mammalian target of rapamycin pathway. Metabolic and genetic conditions may also play a role but hitherto there are few conclusive studies. Clinical diagnosis of SSVD includes early executive dysfunction manifested by impaired capacity to use complex information, to formulate strategies, and to exercise self-control. In comparison with Alzheimer’s disease (AD), patients with SSVD show less pronounced episodic memory deficits. Brain imaging has advanced substantially the diagnostic tools for SSVD. With the exception of cortical microinfarcts, all other lesions are well visualized with MRI. Diagnostic biomarkers that separate AD from SSVD include reduction of cerebrospinal fluid amyloid-β (Aβ)
