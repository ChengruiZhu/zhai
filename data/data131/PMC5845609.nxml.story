A RGB was observed in 93 patients, who had a median age of 45 (25–70) years, and were comprised of 69 (74.2%) females. The most common presentation was recurrence pain (n=64, 68.8%). Associated choledocholithiasis was present in 23 patients (24.7%). An ultrasonography (USG) failed to diagnose RGB calculi in 10 (11%) patients; whereas, magnetic resonance cholangio-pancreatography (MRCP) accurately diagnosed RGB calculi in all the cases except for 2 (4%) and, additionally, detected common bile duct (CBD) stones in 12 patients. Completion cholecystectomy was performed in all patients (open 45 [48.4%]; laparoscopic 48 [51.6%] and 19 [20.4%] patients required a conversion to open). The RGB pathology included stones in 90 (96.8%), Mirizzi's syndrome in 10 (10.8%) and an internal fistula in 9 (9.7%) patients. Additional procedures included CBD exploration (n=6); Choledocho-duodenostomy (n=4) and Roux-en-Y hepatico-jejunostomy (n=3). The mortality and morbidity were nil and 11% (all wound infection), respectively. Two patients developed incisional hernia during follow up. The mean follow up duration was 23.1 months (3–108) in 65 patients and the outcome was excellent and good in 97% of the patients.
