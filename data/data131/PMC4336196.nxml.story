Background:
Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium DT8 is uncommon within the European Union. An increase in this phage type was reported in the summer of 2013 in the States of Jersey.
Methods:
A total of 21 human cases with this phage type were microbiologically confirmed. Salmonella isolates from mayonnaise made using raw eggs were also confirmed as being Salmonella Typhimurium DT8. The epidemiological investigations strongly supported a link between mayonnaise consumption and illness. Whole genome sequencing (WGS) was used to retrospectively investigate this outbreak with a view to assess the similarity between the suspect food and the human isolates and to characterise a known point source outbreak to assist in development of algorithms for outbreak detection.
Results:
Sequence data showed that the outbreak associated isolates, including the food isolates, formed a tightly clustered monophyletic group, with a maximum pairwise distance of 3 single nucleotide polymorphisms.
Conclusions:
WGS data is useful in confirming the causative agent of outbreaks where food and clinical isolates are available. This dataset, comprising a known outbreak, will be useful in the development of automatic algorithms for outbreak detection.
