 The effects of environmental temperature on thrombosis in circulating blood were tested in the extracorporeal loop by the method previously described. Cold (7째 to 15째C.) about the collodion tube retards the clotting of circulating blood. Obstruction of the arterial cannula occurs after from 15 to 25 minutes. Heat (40째 and 55째C.) tends to hasten clotting; obstruction by red clot takes place after from 4 to 6 minutes and from 2 to 4 minutes, respectively. In the latter case no characteristic thrombus structure may be seen. These results were what might be expected. The formation of white thrombi occurs even under the influence of cold, and they continue to form and grow as long as the circulation continues. When the carotid artery is partially occluded and the blood stream slowed, after the injection of the anticoagulant, the blood has a tendency to form red thrombi on the foreign surface of the vascular loop. The thrombi are deposited chiefly in the arterial half of the apparatus, especially at the bottom of the arterial end of the collodion tube, just as in the case of Aschoff's sand experiments. In spite of incoagulability of heparinized blood, red clots, with interwoven fibrin bands, are found. Also very tiny white thrombi may form in other parts of the collodion tube. The effect of complete obstruction of the carotid artery and jugular vein on thrombus formation was studied after the use of anticoagulant. When the carotid artery is obstructed the formation of white thrombi is negligible and sedimentation of erythrocytes and deposition of fibrin appear throughout the apparatus; then the blood, at a standstill, clots very slowly. When the jugular vein is obstructed, dislodgment of platelet thrombi probably results from the pulsating movement, and sedimentation of erythrocytes follows, forming mixed thrombi. The dislodged white thrombi tend to gather in the bottom of the tubes of the widest caliber, especially in the collodion tube.
