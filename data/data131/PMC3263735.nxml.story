The Fungal Secretome KnowledgeBase (FunSecKB) provides a resource of secreted fungal proteins, i.e. secretomes, identified from all available fungal protein data in the NCBI RefSeq database. The secreted proteins were identified using a well evaluated computational protocol which includes SignalP, WolfPsort and Phobius for signal peptide or subcellular location prediction, TMHMM for identifying membrane proteins, and PS-Scan for identifying endoplasmic reticulum (ER) target proteins. The entries were mapped to the UniProt database and any annotations of subcellular locations that were either manually curated or computationally predicted were included in FunSecKB. Using a web-based user interface, the database is searchable, browsable and downloadable by using NCBIâ€™s RefSeq accession or gi number, UniProt accession number, keyword or by species. A BLAST utility was integrated to allow users to query the database by sequence similarity. A user submission tool was implemented to support community annotation of subcellular locations of fungal proteins. With the complete fungal data from RefSeq and associated web-based tools, FunSecKB will be a valuable resource for exploring the potential applications of fungal secreted proteins.
