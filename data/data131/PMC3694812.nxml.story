Signal transduction is a ubiquitous and essential mechanism regulating cellular functions, including responses to environmental stress. Dysfunction of signaling pathways results in a variety of diseases, including cancer, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease. Phosphorylation regulates the activity of signaling and target proteins at different cellular locations and controls activation and inactivation of signal pathways. Here, we provide an analysis of phosphoproteome datasets from yeast, utilizing kinase mutants versus wild type strains. In order to provide an objective approach to identify candidate proteins involved in the transition to a filamentous growth form, we proposed and applied a comprehensive pipeline incorporating statistical and mathematical methods to investigate the phosphoproteome data from multiple perspectives. This included phosphorylation variation in response to a single mutant, phosphorylation variation patterns over multiple mutants, and the relationships represented by these patterns. We make an effort to discover the components and targets of the signaling network, infer the network structure, and to find the relationships of changes of protein phosphorylation to cellular functions, specifically in response to stress in the context of filamentous growth.
