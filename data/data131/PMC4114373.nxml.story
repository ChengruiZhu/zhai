The presence of substernal goiter is, per se, an indication for surgical management. Surgical approach of substernal goiter can most commonly be performed using the cervical access, but at times, a sternotomy or thoracotomy is necessary. The aim of this study was to identify the preoperative predictors of a sternotomy in the management of substernal goiter in order to provide better preoperative planning and patient consent. Between 2005 and 2012, 665 patients were referred to our clinic for thyroidectomy, 42 patients (6.3%) had substernal goiter and were included in this study. All substernal goiters were treated surgically, 38 (90.5%) by a cervical approach and 4 (9.5%) by full median sternotomy. All surgeries were successful, with no major postoperative complications. Minor postoperative complications of transient hypocalcemia and transient paralysis of the recurrent laryngeal nerve occurred in 5 (11.9%) and 2 (4.7%) cases, respectively. Indication of median sternotomy was as follows: extension of goiter below the aortic arch, large thyroid tissue extending towards tracheal bifurcation, and ectopic thyroid tissue in the mediastinum. Substernal goiter can be removed through a cervical incision, but on rare occasions, a median sternotomy may be required.
