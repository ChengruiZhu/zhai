Rac GTPase activating protein 1 (RacGAP1) can regulate cytokinesis and cell differentiation. The oncogenic role of RacGAP1 has been partially studied in gastric cancer, colorectal cancer, and breast cancer. In the present study, we endeavor to evaluate its expression and functions in epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC). We retrospectively collected the clinicopathological information of 117 patients who underwent curative surgery for EOC. Expression of RacGAP1 protein in primary tumor tissues was evaluated by immunohistochemistry, which was significantly associated with tumor pathological grade, tumor stage, and lymph node metastasis. Patients with lower RacGAP1 level had a longer survival time and lower recurrence risk. Multivariate results identified the independent prognostic role of RacGAP1 for both recurrence and survival in EOC patients. Cellular studies showed that RacGAP1 can positively regulate the activation of RhoA and Erk proteins. In addition, wound healing assay and Transwell assay found that RacGAP1 can up‚Äêregulate the migration and invasion process of EOC cells, respectively. In all, our results not only confirmed the prognostic role of RacGAP1 for recurrence and survival in EOC patients, but also highlighted its possible potency for drug development.
