It is still unknown to what extent ecological associations between microbes, as measured by co-occurrence of different taxa in 16S rRNA surveys, can be explained, or predicted, using composition and structure of microbial genomes alone. Here I introduce two new genome-wide, pairwise indices for quantifying the propensity of microbial species to interact with each other. The first measure quantifies similarity in genome composition between two microbes. The second measure summarizes the topology of a protein functional association network built for a given pair of microbes and quantifies the fraction of network edges crossing organismal boundaries. I then study the ability of two newly proposed and two previously reported indices to explain variation in microbial co-occurrence. All four measures are significantly correlated with co-occurrence of microbes even when accounting for evolutionary relationships between the species. One of the newly developed indices outperforms previously proposed ones and explains up to 3.5% of the variance in co-occurrence. In summary, the indices described here are able to detect ecological associations between species using only their genomic information; however, additional methods are needed to provide more reliable genomic tools for microbial ecology.
