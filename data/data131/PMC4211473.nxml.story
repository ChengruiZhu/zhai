14-3-3 is a highly conserved protein involved in a number of cellular processes including cell signalling, cell cycle regulation and gene transcription. Seven isoforms of the protein have been identified; β, γ, ε, ζ η σ and τ. The expression profile of the various isoforms in skin diseases is unknown. To investigate the expression of the seven 14-3-3 isoforms in involved and uninvolved skin from psoriasis, basal cell carcinoma (BCC), atopic dermatitis and nickel induced allergic contact dermatitis. Punch biopsies from involved and uninvolved skin were analyzed with quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction to determine the mRNA expression of the 14-3-3 isoforms. The protein level of 14-3-3 isoforms was measured by Western blot technique in keratome biopsies from patients with psoriasis. Evaluation of dermal and epidermal protein expression was performed by immunofluorescence staining. Increased 14-3-3τ mRNA levels were detected in involved skin from patients with psoriasis, contact dermatitis and BCC. 14-3-3σ mRNA expression was increased in psoriasis and contact dermatitis, but not in BCC. In atopic dermatitis no significant difference between involved and uninvolved skin was found. The expression of the 14-3-3 isoforms was also studied at the protein level in psoriasis. Only 14-3-3τ expression was significantly increased in involved psoriatic skin compared with uninvolved skin. Immunofluorescence staining with 14-3-3τ- and 14-3-3σ-specific antibodies showed localization of both isoforms to the cytoplasm of the keratinocytes in the various skin sections. These results demonstrate a disease specific expression profile of the 14-3-3τ and 14-3-3σ iso-forms.
