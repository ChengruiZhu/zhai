. We can offer no suggestions, at present, as to the way in which these effects are produced. It is probable that the very thin protoplasmic layer of these species, which is certainly no thicker than 8µ, is sufficient to obstruct the passage of proteins having large molecules, like egg albumen, with a degree of efficiency that is extraordinary. In the tests we have reported, areas of from 20 sq. cm. to 40 sq. cm. have been submitted to the action of a relatively high concentration of egg albumen for several days without permitting the passage of sufficient amounts to give definable tests either with Spiegler's or with Tanret's method,— presumably less than 1 part in 250,000. In the tests of the proteins having much smaller molecules (though the size may not be the explanation), there is some probability that the membranes exhibit a little permeability. The peptone and the proteose of animal origin, or biuret-positive substances derived from them, apparently pass the protoplasmic membranes occasionally in quantities sufficient to give biuret tests. The most probable case of protein passage, however, was that of the proteose of the scarlet runner bean, where specific detection of less than 1 part per 80,000 was possible. In this instance the proteose appeared to pass membranes that were healthy and were functioning normally. But since the cells of the algae had to be destroyed in making the tests, one cannot maintain this point. All one can say is that protein passage was indicated in carefully examined cells of both species, where no breaks in the protoplasmic membrane were discernible, and where samples of the treated cells behaved normally after treatment.
