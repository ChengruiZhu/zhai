Most non-small-cell lung cancers (NSCLCs) harboring activating mutations in the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) are initially responsive to EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (EGFR-TKIs); however, they invariably develop resistance to these drugs. E7820 is an angiogenesis inhibitor that decreases integrin-Î±2 expression and is currently undergoing clinical trials. We investigated whether E7820 in combination with erlotinib, an EGFR-TKI, could overcome EGFR-TKI-resistance in the NSCLC cell lines A549 (KRAS; G12S), H1975 (EGFR; L858R/T790M), and H1650 (PTEN; loss, EGFR; exon 19 deletion), which are resistant to erlotinib. Immunohistochemical analysis was carried out in xenografted tumors to investigate anti-angiogenesis activity and endothelial cell apoptosis levels by endothelial cell marker CD31 and TUNEL staining, respectively. Treatment with E7820 (50 mg/kg) with erlotinib (60 mg/kg) showed a synergistic antitumor effect in three xenograft models. Immunohistochemical analysis indicated that combined treatment with E7820 and erlotinib significantly decreased microvessel density and increased apoptosis of tumor-associated endothelial cells compared with use of only one of the agents. This combination increased apoptosis in HUVECs through activation of both intrinsic and extrinsic apoptosis pathways
