Genomic instability forms unstable chromosomes that generate genomic rearrangements associated with human disease. Because unstable chromosomes are inherently dynamic and rarely observed, mechanisms of instability are often inferred from genomic sequencing of the end state. Longitudinal observation of events, from initiation to resolution to a stable state, is rarely feasible. Here we document DNA replication errors at the chromosome end that lead to the formation of unstable chromosomes; the unstable chromosomes progressively rearrange and then resolve to stable structures. Error between DNA replication and telomere maintenance synergize to form unstable chromosomes at an extremely high frequency. Surprisingly, we find unstable chromosomes often convert to a stable form in a single centromeric region we previously suggested was a fragile site, that we now call a "collection site". Thus, the most commonly recovered end state of chromosome instability, which localizes to the middle of the chromosome, is caused by replication error at the chromosome end. Our findings are relevant to mechanisms impacting short-term (pathology) and long-term evolution, including genomic instability, telomere replication error and events at fragile sites.
