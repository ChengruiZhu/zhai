The aim of this study was to determine the natural history of growth and quality of life (QoL) outcomes for vestibular schwannoma (VS) managed conservatively, and to validate the disease-specific Penn Acoustic Neuroma Quality-of-Life (PANQOL) scale in French language. We retrospectively studied 26 patients with VS managed conservatively. Patient characteristics and radiological findings were collected. Two scales were used to measure QoL: the Short Form-36 Health Survey (SF-36) and the PANQOL scale translated into French. Internal consistency and scores were compared with previous studies. The mean follow-up was 25 months (range 6-72). We observed tumour growth in 14 patients (53.8%), no growth in 12 patients (46.2%) and no case of tumour shrinkage. The mean tumour growth was 2.22 mm/year. No predictive factor of growth was found. Patients with vertigo or dizziness experienced a poorer QoL according to the SF-36 (Social Functioning and Emotional Role Limitation dimensions) and to the PANQOL scale (Balance and Energy dimensions). Our results were comparable with the literature using the SF-36. With the PANQOL scale, our scores were not statistically different with those from Dutch and North American studies except in the field of hearing (p = 0.019). Quality of life becomes essential in the management of VS. According to these results, we support a non-conservative strategy associated with vestibular rehabilitation for patients with dizziness or vertigo. The PANQOL is a validated specific scale for VS, which can be useful in French.
