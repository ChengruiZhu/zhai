The aim of the present study was to investigate the function of 15-hydroxyprostaglandin dehydrogenase (15-PGDH) and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) in angiogenesis and their association with the prognosis of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Using immunohistochemical staining, the expression of 15-PGDH and COX-2, and the microvessel density (MVD) levels were evaluated in 35 NSCLC specimens. Paracancerous normal lung tissue was collected as control samples from six patients. The correlation of 15-PGDH with COX-2, clinicopathological characteristics, MVD and overall survival (OS) was studied. NSCLC tissues showed a significantly lower expression level of 15-PGDH (P=0.009) and a significantly higher expression level of COX-2 (P=0.004) compared with normal lung tissue. The expression level of 15-PGDH was negatively correlated with MVD (P<0.001) and COX-2 expression (P=0.032). A low expression level of 15-PGDH, a high expression level of COX-2 and high levels of MVD were significantly correlated with a shorter OS time (15-PGDH, P<0.0001; COX-2, P=0.038; MVD, P<0.0001). This study provided clinical evidence that a low expression level of 15-PGDH is associated with a poor prognosis in NSCLC. Furthermore, it was shown that 15-PGDH and COX-2 reciprocally regulate cancer angiogenesis, which may affect the prognosis of patients with NSCLC.
