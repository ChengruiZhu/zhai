The purpose of this study was to investigate the application of bromelain in the treatment of pain, swelling, and limited mouth opening in patients with hematologic tumor after extraction of the third molar during chemotherapy. We recruited 72 patients with hematologic tumor who were treated by oral and maxillofacial surgery in our hospital, and third molar extraction was performed under local anesthesia. After extraction, patients in the control group were treated with cold - hot compress and patients in the experimental group were treated by oral administration of bromelain. One, three, and seven days after extraction, pain, swelling, and mouth opening in the experimental group improved compared to the control group. Additionally, the levels of IL-25 and TNF-α in the experimental group were significantly lower than in the control group, suggesting less inflammatory response. On the other hand, EGFR and β-FGF were significantly higher in the experimental group, supporting the activation of tissue repair pathways. Quality of life scores were significantly better in the experimental group. Overall, bromelain improves the quality of life, alleviates pain, swelling, and mouth opening, and effectively prevent postoperative complications in patients with hematologic tumors after third molar extraction during chemotherapy.
