In the 258 separations which satisfied the fixed criteria were men in 226 cases (87.6%) and women in 32 (12.4%). There is a statically significant difference in the platelet value between the groups and this value is higher in group D than in group C. The average value of platelets before separation was 46.66. The range of minimal and maximal value is from 38.8 to 52.4 Â±2.78. The initial value of hematocrits of the donor does not intervene in the length of the separation, but it has a significant effect on the efficiency of the platelet collection. Increases in the number of hematocrits significantly decrease the efficiency of platelet collection. In practice it means that we can base on this fact make a better selection of donors. In this kind selection, one should prefer a donor with a higher number of initial platelets and lower levels of hematocrits. In that way we can collect a more important yield, have a shorter length of separation and increase the efficiency of platelet collection. Its advantage is as well medical because of a more important yield but also financial because of the decrease of the length of the separation and the increase in efficiency. Key words: value of hematocrits, donors, apheresis, platelets, efficiency.
