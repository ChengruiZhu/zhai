In a pair of articles, we present a generalized quantitative model for the homeostatic function of clonal humoral immune system. In this second paper, we describe how antibody production controls the saturation of antigens and the network of antibody interactions that emerges in the epitome space with the establishment of the immune system. Efficient control of antigens, be it self or foreign, requires the maintenance of antibody concentrations that saturate antigen to relevant levels. Simple calculations suggest that the observed diverse recognition of antigens by natural antibodies is only possible by cross-reactivity whereby particular clones of antibodies bind to diverse targets and shared recognition of particular antigens by multiple antibody clones contribute to the maintenance of antigen control. We also argue that natural antibodies are none else than the result of thymus-independent responses against immunological self. We interpret and explain antibody production and function in a virtual molecular interaction space and as a network of interactions. Indeed, the general quantitative (GQM) model we propose is in agreement with earlier models, confirms some assumptions and presumably provides the theoretical basis for the construction of a real antibody network using the sequence and interaction database data.
