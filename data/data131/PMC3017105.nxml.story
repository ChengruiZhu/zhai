Antimicrobial agents have been the mainstay of treatment for a variety of infectious diseases such as urinary tract infections and pneumonia. Due to the increasing incidence of antimicrobial resistance, there is an ever demanding need to develop new antimicrobial agents rapidly. These agents can be given in different ways, both in terms of the daily dose and dosing frequency. The traditional approach to the design of antimicrobial agent dosing regimen relies primarily on a categorical classification, which often could be restrictive. We proposed a new computational method to provide quantitative insights to the interaction between an antimicrobial agent and a pathogen (pharmacodynamics). With a more robust understanding of this relationship, the effectiveness of different antimicrobial dosing regimens can be compared efficiently, which would facilitate new agent development by rationally guiding dosing regimen selection. The relevance of our approach was supported by a series of experimental validation using different antimicrobial agents and bacteria. A higher probability of resistance suppression could be achieved with optimal dosing regimens, which may prolong the clinical utility of new agents under development.
