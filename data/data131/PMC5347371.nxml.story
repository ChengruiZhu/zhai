Recently, there has been accumulating evidence suggesting pleiotropy, i.e., genetic components shared across multiple phenotypes. Incorporation of pleiotropy in genetic analysis might improve statistical power to identify risk associated genetic variants. Several statistical approaches have been proposed to utilize pleiotropy for association mapping but they are currently still limited to a relatively small number of phenotypes, e.g., a pair of phenotypes. This restricts potential gain in statistical power in association mapping and investigation of pleiotropic structure among a large number of phenotypes. In order to address this challenge, in this paper, we propose graph-GPA, a novel statistical framework to integrate a large number of phenotypes using a hidden Markov random field architecture. Application of the proposed statistical method to GWAS datasets for 12 phenotypes showed that graph-GPA does not only provide a parsimonious representation of genetic relationship among these phenotypes, but also identify significantly larger number of novel genetic variants that are potentially functional. We believe that this novel approach might help investigation of common etiology and improvement of diagnosis and therapeutics.
