The researchers collected plasma (the liquid part of blood that contains circulating antibodies) from patients recently infected with HIV (acute infection) and patients who had been infected for some time (chronically infected). They also isolated HIV from each of the patientsâ€”so-called autologous virus. They then used a sensitive molecular biology assay to test each plasma sample for its ability to lyse the autologous virus (and also a standard virus) when supplied with complement from a healthy donor. Most of the plasma samples were able to lyse HIV, although the samples taken from chronically infected patients generally caused more lysis than those from acutely infected patients. In the chronically infected patients, the level of lysis induced was not related to the amount of virus in the patients' blood (viremia). However, plasma taken from acutely infected patients with higher viral loads was less active in the lysis assay than plasma taken from patients with lower viral loads. Finally, the researchers showed that the levels of antibodies in the various plasma samples to the two envelope proteins of HIV correlated strongly with the ability of each sample to lyse the standard virus and that these antibodies were mainly non-neutralizing antibodies.
