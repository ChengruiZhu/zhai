Using sheep erythrocytes and liposomes, an inhibitory effect of gangliosides has been shown on the activation of the alternative pathway of complement. However, in studies using human erythrocytes, we found that gangliosides had hemolytic activity that was possibly mediated through activation of the alternative pathway. Pretreatment of human erythrocytes obtained from healthy volunteers or paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH) patients with a ganglioside mixture purified from human erythrocytes enhanced their susceptibility to homologous human complement, and resulted in dose-dependent hemolysis. The enhancement was more marked in PNH erythrocytes than control cells. Protease treatment of the ganglioside mixture did not change its hemolytic activity, but sialidase treatment abolished the activity. Among the major erythrocyte gangliosides, II3NeuAc-LacCer (GM3) was the most potent hemolytic agent. Gangliosides purified from bovine brain were also active, while neither nonsialylated glycosphingolipids, the ceramide moiety, or sialic acid alone were active. Sialic acid residues in the ganglioside molecules were essential to this activity, but the amount of the residue or the source of the gangliosides seemed not to be important. Several treatments inhibiting the alternative but not classical complement pathway markedly reduced the ganglioside hemolytic activity. This novel bioactivity of gangliosides was thus suggested to be mediated partly by activation of the alternative pathway.
