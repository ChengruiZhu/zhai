Leucine-rich repeats and immunoglobulin-like domains 1 (LRIG1) is a tumor suppressor and a negative regulator of several receptor tyrosine kinases. The molecular mechanisms by which LRIG1 mediates its tumor suppressor effects and regulates receptor tyrosine kinases remain incompletely understood. Here, we performed a yeast two-hybrid screen to identify novel LRIG1-interacting proteins and mined data from the BioPlex (biophysical interactions of ORFeome-based complexes) protein interaction data repository. The putative LRIG1 interactors identified in the screen were functionally evaluated using a triple co-transfection system in which HEK293 cells were co-transfected with platelet-derived growth factor receptor α, LRIG1, and shRNAs against the identified LRIG1 interactors. The effects of the shRNAs on the ability of LRIG1 to down-regulate platelet-derived growth factor receptor α expression were evaluated. On the basis of these results, we present an LRIG1 protein interaction network with many newly identified components. The network contains the apparently functionally important LRIG1-interacting proteins RAB4A, PON2, GAL3ST1, ZBTB16, LRIG2, CNPY3, HLA-DRA, GML, CNPY4, LRRC40, and LRIG3, together with GLRX3, PTPRK, and other proteins.
