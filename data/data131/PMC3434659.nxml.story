Notch pathway is a well-known factor in the development of lymphoid lineage. However, its role in the myeloid lineage has remained ambiguous. We looked into the effect of Notch1 on the megakaryocytic lineage commitment and found an increase in megakaryocyte-specific lineage markers upon transfection with Notch1 intracellular domain (NICD). This effect was mediated by Akt whereby constitutive activation of Akt increased the megakaryocyte markers, whereas inhibition of Akt signalling reduced these marker levels. Along with the change in differentiation status, NICD-induced initiation of early megakaryopoiesis was accompanied by an increased cytoplasmic enhancer of zeste homolog-2 (EZH2) expression. This process was found to be Akt-dependent, and inhibition or overexpression of Akt lead to concurrent changes in EZH2 levels. To elucidate the function of EZH2 in the cytoplasm, novel cytoplasmic interactors of EZH2 were identified by co-immunoprecipitation followed by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization MS/MS-based protein identification, and thus, PDIA1 and LIM domain kinase-1 (LIMK1) were identified. Interaction of EZH2 with LIMK1 changed the activity of cofilin (a downstream target of LIMK1) towards actin filaments, thereby leading to lower filamentous actin content within these cells. Thus, Notch1 not only induces early megakaryopoiesis but also prepares these cells for subsequent morphological changes.
