In the germ line of sexually reproducing organisms, haploid gametes are generated from diploid precursor cells by a specialized cell division called meiosis. Reduction by half of chromosome numbers during the first meiotic division depends on genetic exchange, resulting in the formation of crossovers. Without crossovers, pairs of homologous chromosomes frequently fail to separate, resulting in unbalanced gametes with a surplus or deficit of individual chromosomes. Along a given chromosome, crossovers form in different locations in different cells, but distribution of crossovers within each cell is controlled in two ways: first, at least one crossover is formed along each homolog pair, irrespective of size; second, a crossover in a given interval reduces the frequency of crossovers in adjacent chromosome regions. Here, we identify functions of the evolutionarily conserved protein Pch2 in suppressing additional crossovers in adjacent regions and ensuring homolog segregation under certain conditions. Pch2 further controls the assembly of chromosome axis protein Hop1 at future crossover sites. Our findings reveal that chromosome axes undergo structural changes at the same positions where crossovers occur. Thus, axis remodeling and crossover placement are linked via Pch2.
