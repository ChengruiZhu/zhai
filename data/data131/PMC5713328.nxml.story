Expansion of chondrocytes for repair of articular cartilage can lead to dedifferentiation, making it difficult to obtain a sufficient quantity of chondrocytes. Although previous studies have suggested that culture in a three-dimensional environment induces redifferentiation of dedifferentiated chondrocytes, its underlying mechanisms are still poorly understood in terms of metabolism compared with a two-dimensional environment. In this study, we demonstrate that attenuation of transglutaminase 2 (TG2), a multifunctional enzyme, stimulates redifferentiation of dedifferentiated chondrocytes. Fibroblast-like morphological changes increased as TG2 expression increased in passage-dependent manner. When dedifferentiated chondrocytes were cultured in a pellet culture system, TG2 expression was reduced and glycolytic enzyme expression up-regulated. Previous studies demonstrated that TG2 influences energy metabolism, and impaired glycolytic metabolism causes chondrocyte dedifferentiation. Interestingly, TG2 knockdown improved chondrogenic gene expression, glycolytic enzyme expression, and lactate production in a monolayer culture system. Taken together, down-regulation of TG2 is involved in redifferentiaton of dedifferentiated chondrocytes through enhancing glucose metabolism.
