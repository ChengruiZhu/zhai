After encounter with antigen, the antibody repertoire is shaped by somatic hypermutation (SHM), which leads to an increase in the affinity of antibodies for the antigen, and class-switch recombination (CSR), which results in a change in the effector function of antibodies. Both SHM and CSR are initiated by activation-induced cytidine deaminase (AID), which deaminates deoxycytidine to deoxyuridine in single-stranded DNA (ssDNA). The precise mechanism responsible for the formation of ssDNA in V regions undergoing SHM has yet to be experimentally established. In this study, we searched for ssDNA in mutating V regions in which DNA–protein complexes were preserved in the context of chromatin in human B cell lines and in primary mouse B cells. We found that V regions that undergo SHM were enriched in short patches of ssDNA, rather than R loops, on both the coding and noncoding strands. Detection of these patches depended on the presence of DNA-associated proteins and required active transcription. Consistent with this, we found that both DNA strands in the V region were transcribed. We conclude that regions of DNA that are targets of SHM assemble protein–DNA complexes in which ssDNA is exposed, making it accessible to AID.
