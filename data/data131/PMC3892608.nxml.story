Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) is a rapidly progressive and ultimately fatal disorder of the central nervous system. It occurs worldwide with an incidence of 0.5-1 new case per million population per year. No specific treatment is available and management is limited to supportive care. Autopsy or biopsy provides a definitive diagnosis. Because of the transmissible nature of the disease and hesitancy of patients/family members to give consent for biopsy, numerous challenges in confirming the clinical diagnosis are faced by healthcare professionals. We report a case of 66-year-old male who was hospitalized due to hip fracture following a fall. Acute mental status changes followed the surgical fixation of hip fracture which triggered neurologic work up. This finally revealed suspicion and confirmation of CJD. Patient had progressive cognitive decline with akinetic mutism during further hospital stay and was later discharged home with hospice. Shorter thereafter he died at home. This case demonstrates the importance of keeping an open mind towards possibility of CJD when faced with esoteric neurologic presentations. Also this case provides insight into challenges in quarantine and sterilization of surgical instruments when these patients go through major surgeries.
