The most common operating system used by participants was the iOS platform (55/101, 54.5%), with English the most commonly used language to operate residentsâ€™ mobile phones (96/100, 96.0%) despite their native language being Arabic. For communication outside medical practice, chatting applications such as WhatsApp matched phone calls as most commonly used tools (each 88/101, 87.1%).
