Telomeres contain TTAGGG repetitive sequences and are located at the end of human chromosomes. Telomere dysfunction is associated with some age-related and chronic diseases, but its relationship with foods, dietary patterns, and occupational class in the young male population is not yet known. In this cross-sectional study, 300 healthy men, residents of Tehran, aged 25–40 years were enrolled from January to December 2016. We employed a cross-sectional study of 300 healthy people, residents of Tehran, aged 25-40 years. A food frequency questionnaire was used to obtain food intakes of all participants and converted into actual food intake (g/day). The principal components analysis was used to determine dietary patterns and other demographic characteristics. Leukocyte telomere length (TL) was measured by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to measure number of telomere repeat copy number (T) to the relative number of 36B4 copies (S) (T/S ratio). T/S in office-workers, waste recyclers, and other workers were 1.22 ± 0.4, 1.08 ± 0.3, and 1.094 ± 0.34, respectively. The results of multivariate linear regression adjusted for age, body mass index (BMI), and smoking were showed that whole grains (β = 0.02;
