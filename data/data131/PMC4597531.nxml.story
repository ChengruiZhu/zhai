Testing was performed on 2 groups of 18 matched pair clavicles, which were randomly distributed between groups. There were no significant differences between the groups regarding bone mess density (BMD), clavicle width, age, and gender. One clavicle from each pair was prepared according to one of two reconstruction techniques; the contralateral clavicle was left intact. Both techniques placed 2 tunnels through the medial clavicle, 30 mm and 45 mm from the lateral border. Group 1 (mean age: 53, range: 44-63; mean BMD: 0.48, range: 0.39-0.59) was prepared with 2.4 mm tunnels and augmentation devices. Group 2 (mean age: 56, range: 45-63; mean BMD: 0.47, range 0.35-0.61) was prepared with 6.0 mm tunnels with hamstring grafts and tenodesis screws. A 3-point bending load was applied to the distal clavicles at 15 mm/min until failure. Ultimate failure load and anterior-posterior width 45 mm medial from the lateral border were recorded for each specimen. Strength reduction was determined as the percent reduction in ultimate failure load between paired intact and surgically prepared clavicles. Relative tunnel size was determined as the quotient of tunnel diameter and clavicle width. An independent observer performed all clavicle width measurements. Non-parametric statistics were used (MWU, Kendallâ€™s Tau).
