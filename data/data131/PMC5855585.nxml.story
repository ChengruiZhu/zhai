 Herba (ODH) has been known to exhibit anti-cancer and anti-inflammatory effects, its anti-amnestic effect has never been reported so far. The aim of this present study was to elucidate the anti-amnestic effect of ODH. ODH pretreatment significantly reduced escape latency of scopolamine treated Institute of Cancer Research (ICR) mice compared to untreated control groups in a Morris water maze test. Similarly, the passive avoidance test showed that ODH treatment recovered the scopolamine induced amnesia in the ICR mouse model. Concentration of Ach in brains of ODH treated mice was increased compared to that of scopolamine treated mice. In addition, activity of acetylcholinesterase (AChE) was notably decreased by ODH. The protein expression of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and phospho-cAMP response element-binding protein (p-CREB) (Ser133) was increased in ODH pretreated group compared to control group. Consistently, immunohistochemistry (IHC) revealed the elevated expression of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and p-CREB in brains of ODH treated mice compared to the control group. Overall, these findings suggest that ODH has anti-amnestic potential via activation of BDNF and p-CREB and inhibition of AChE in mice with scopolamine induced amnesia.
