Genetic research has been focused at analysis of datapoints that are assumed to be deterministically known. However, the majority of current, high throughput data is only probabilistically known, and proper methods for handing such uncertain genotypes are limited. Here, we build on existing theory from the field of statistics to introduce a general framework for handling probabilistic genotype data obtained through genotype imputation. This framework, called Multiple Imputation, matches or improves upon existing methods for handling uncertainty in basic analysis of genetic association. As opposed to such methods, our work furthermore extends to more advanced analysis, such as mixed-effects models, with no additional complication. Importantly, it generates posterior probabilities of association that are intrinsically weighted by the certainty of the underlying data, a feature unmatched by other existing methods. Multiple Imputation is also fully compatible with meta-analysis. Finally, our analysis of probabilistic genotype data brings into focus the accuracy and unreliability of imputationâ€™s estimated probabilities. Taken together, these results substantially increase the utility of imputed genotypes in statistical genetics, and may have strong implications for analysis of sequencing data moving forward.
