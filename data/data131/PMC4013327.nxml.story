Neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT), which can reduce the size and therefore increase the resectability of tumors, has recently evolved as a treatment for locally advanced cervical cancer. NACT has been reported to decrease the risk of pathologic factors related to prognosis of cervical cancer. To further assess the effects of NACT on surgery and the pathologic characteristics of cervical cancer, we reviewed 110 cases of locally advanced cervical cancer treated with radical hysterectomy with or without NACT at the People's Hospital of Peking University between January 2006 and December 2010. Of 110 patients, 68 underwent platinum-based NACT prior to surgery (NACT group) and 42 underwent primary surgery treatment (PST group). Our results showed 48 of 68 (70.6%) patients achieved a complete response or partial response to NACT. Estimated blood loss, operation time, and number of removed lymph nodes during surgery, as well as complication rates during and after surgery were not significantly different between the NACT group and the PST group. The rates of deep stromal invasion, positive parametria, positive surgical vaginal margins, and lymph node metastasis were not significantly different between the two groups. However, the rate of lymph-vascular space involvement (LVSI) was significantly lower in the NACT group than in the PST group (
