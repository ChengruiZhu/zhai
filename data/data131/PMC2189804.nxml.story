-terminal (LN) isoforms. In the mouse genome, LN-specific exons are upstream of an SN-specific exon, which is in turn upstream of common exons. LN-agrin is expressed in both neural and nonneural tissues. In spinal cord it is expressed in discrete subsets of cells, including motoneurons. In contrast, SN-agrin is selectively expressed in the nervous system but is widely distributed in many neuronal cell types. Both isoforms are externalized from cells but LN-agrin assembles into basal laminae whereas SN-agrin remains cell associated. Differential expression of the two isoforms appears to be transcriptionally regulated, whereas the unique SN and LN sequences direct their distinct subcellular localizations. Insertion of a “gene trap” construct into the mouse genome between the LN and SN exons abolished expression of LN-agrin with no detectable effect on expression levels of SN-agrin or on SN-agrin bioactivity in vitro. Agrin protein was absent from all basal laminae in mice lacking LN-agrin transcripts. The formation of the neuromuscular junctions was as drastically impaired in these mutants as in mice lacking all forms of agrin. Thus, basal lamina–associated LN-agrin is required for neuromuscular synaptogenesis, whereas cell-associated SN-agrin may play distinct roles in the central nervous system.
