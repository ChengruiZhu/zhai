Much of the difference between individual humans is in the number of copies of genes and lengths of genome. The mechanisms by which copy number variation arises are not well understood. We sought information on copy number change mechanisms by extensive use of array comparative genomic hybridization of whole genomes in bacteria selected for amplification of part of the genome. We report that about 10% of amplified isolates carried other chromosomal structural changes associated with the amplification, a result comparable to that seen in human copy number variants. Importantly, we found a significant occurrence of structural changes that were not involved in the amplification event. These were not seen in a control sample of stressed cells not carrying amplification. This establishes that chromosomal structural change happens in a subpopulation of cells apparently licensed to undergo these changes. Because the changes occur under the stress of starvation and require two of the cells' stress-response systems, we propose that licensing for cell-wide structural change in this subpopulation is a component of response to stress. This idea has implications for the mechanisms of evolution and cancer progression, suggesting that changes occur in a shower of events rather than as isolated random events.
