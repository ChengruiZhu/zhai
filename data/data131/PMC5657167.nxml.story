A 38-year-old woman with advanced keratoconus initially developed Urrets-Zavalia Syndrome (UZS) in the left eye after deep anterior lamellar keratoplasty. During the uneventful surgery, a 7-mm-wide pupil unresponsive to light was noticed. On the first postoperative day, intraocular pressure (IOP) was elevated up to 45 mmHg with shallow anterior chamber (AC). A peripheral iridotomy in 2 oâ€™clock position was conducted and a fixed combination of brinzolamide 1% and timolol 0.5% was administered topically. In the subsequent postoperative period, IOP was successfully reduced, but the patient reported severe photophobia, glare, and decreased vision. Twelve months after surgery, her best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) was 20/200, the fixed-dilated pupil persisted, iris was atrophic, and lens opacities were detected. She was submitted for phacoemulsification cataract surgery combined with iridoplasty using the closed chamber slipping suture technique. Three months after surgery, her BCVA was 20/25, pupil diameter remained stable at 4 mm, and glare symptoms were significantly reduced. A very adequate cosmetic outcome was also achieved. Iridoplasty in postkeratoplasty patient with unilateral UZS was effective in improving patient's visual function disability and restoring residual anisocoria. This technique can be applied as a single procedure or combined with another one for the management of UZS.
