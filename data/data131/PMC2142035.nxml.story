 Atropinesterase was found to exist in approximately one out of every four rabbits, and no relation could be observed between the incidence of the enzyme and season, sex, color, age, or weight. The occurrence of the enzyme was also shown to be unrelated to that of cholinesterase. The distribution of atropinesterase in the blood and organs of rabbits was studied; the animals devoid of the enzyme in their blood contained no demonstrable activity in any of the organ extracts tested. The presence of atropinesterase in frog liver, and its absence from the serum, has been confirmed. Hydrolysis of homatropine, but not atropine, by guinea pig liver was observed, while the serum was without action on either of the compounds. On this basis the possibility arises that guinea pig liver contains a homatropinesterase enzyme separate from atropinesterase. It was shown that lack of atropinesterase activity in certain rabbits is not likely to be due to the presence of a naturally occurring inhibitor. It has been demonstrated that contrary to previous indications neither fresh egg white nor yolk possess atropinesterase activity. The specificity of tropinesterases was investigated and evidence was presented for the possible existence of two distinct enzymes, cocainesterase and tropacocainesterase.
