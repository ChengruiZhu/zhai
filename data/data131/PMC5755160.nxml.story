Scaffold protein neural precursor cell expressed, developmentally downregulated 9 (NEDD9) is a member of the Crk-associated substrate protein family and is known to be a biomarker in multiple cancer types. It serves a critical function in regulating cell proliferation, migration, invasion and survival. The objective of this study was to evaluate the potential effects of NEDD9 in renal cell carcinoma (RCC). The expression of NEDD9 was analyzed by immunohistochemistry, western blotting and reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction. NEDD9 protein and mRNA levels were significantly upregulated in RCC tissues compared with normal tissues (P<0.001). Furthermore, the NEDD9 immunostaining level was significantly associated with primary tumor stage and tumor, node, metastasis stage (P<0.05). High NEDD9 expression resulted in significantly lower survival rates for patients compared with normal NEDD9 expression (P<0.01). In addition, wound healing and transwell assays indicated that NEDD9 depletion by small interfering RNA significantly attenuated the migration and invasion of RCC cells (P<0.001). The present data suggested that NEDD9 may be a novel target for prevention and treatment of RCC metastasis and recurrence.
