DNA methylation is a ubiquitous and simple covalent modification that occurs directly on genetic material whereby a simple methyl group (CH3) is attached to Cytosine nucleotides in the context of CpG sites. Modifications of these sites have been postulated to function in gene regulation, potentially via interactions with transcription factors. In this study, we hypothesized that DNA methylation signals contain valuable information that can help infer transcription factors that may be associated with a given disease. Here, we utilize the vast repository of breast cancer data that is available in the public domain, and which contains a rich resource for DNA methylation and clinical data on breast cancer patients. In this guilt-by-association analysis, we postulated that conserved transcription factor binding motifs that are statistically enriched in regions near methylated CpG sites that are correlated with breast cancer patient survival would suggest that their cognate transcription factors would play a role in the initiation, growth, metastasis, or even suppression of the tumor. This integrative approach supports the claim that DNA methylation profiling of patient tumors in the clinic may contain valuable information that can guide the development of treatment regimens for individual patients; thus contributing to the progression of precision medicine.
