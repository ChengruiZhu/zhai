Hypoxia-inducible factor-1 α (HIF-1α) is an important prognostic factor in ovarian carcinoma. Hypoxia contributes to tumor progression and is involved in the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). Twist2 is an EMT regulator, however, it remains poorly understood in ovarian carcinoma. The present study evaluated the expression of HIF-1α and Twist2 and further investigated whether Twist2 is involved in hypoxia-induced apoptosis in ovarian cancer. A series of matched paraffin-embedded tissue sections from human primary ovarian cancer and normal ovarian tissues were examined through immunohistochemical analysis, a Twist2-overexpressing stable ovarian cancer cell line was established and deferoxamine (DFO) was introduced to simulate hypoxic conditions. DFO-induced apoptosis was examined by fluorescence microscopy, MTT assays and flow cytometry. In addition, a western blot analysis was performed to examine the molecular mechanism(s) of action. Twist2 increased in epithelial ovarian cancers associated with HIF-1α expression. The acquired expression of Twist2 was able to promote the survival of ovarian cancer cells through Akt phosphorylation under DFO-induced hypoxic stress. The results suggest that Twist2 activates the PI-3K-Akt pathway to protect cells from apoptosis in a hypoxic environment. Moreover, Twist2 may be involved in the HIF-1α signaling pathway in ovarian cancer.
