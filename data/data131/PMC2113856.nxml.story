It has been shown that a Triton X-100-insoluble protein matrix can be isolated from the plasma membranes of P815 tumor cells and murine lymphoid cells (Mescher, M. F., M. J. L. Jose and S. P. Balk, 1981, Nature (Lond.), 289:139-144). The properties of the matrix suggested that this set of proteins might form a membrane skeletal structure, stable in the absence of the lipid bilayer. Since purification of plasma membrane results in yields of only 20 to 40%, it was not clear whether the matrix was associated with the entire plasma membrane. To determine if a detergent-insoluble structure was present over the entire cell periphery and stable in the absence of the membrane bilayer or cytoskeletal components, we have examined extraction of whole cells with Triton X-100. Using the same conditions as those used for isolation of the matrix from membranes, we found that extraction of intact cells resulted in structures consisting of a continuous layer of protein at the periphery, a largely empty cytoplasmic space, and a nuclear remnant. Little or no lipid bilayer structure was evident in association with the peripheral layer, and no filamentous cytoskeletal structures could be seen in the cytoplasmic space by thin-section electron microscopy. Analysis of these Triton shells showed them to retain approximately 15% of the total cell protein, most of which was accounted for by low molecular weight nuclear proteins. 5'- Nucleotidase, a cell surface enzyme that remains associated with the plasma membrane matrix, was quantitatively recovered with the shells. Included among the polypeptides present in the shells was a set with mobilities identical to those of the set that makes up the plasma membrane matrix. The polypeptide composition of the shells further confirmed that cytoskeletal proteins were present to a very low extent, if at all, after the extraction. The results demonstrate that a detergent-insoluble protein matrix associated with the periphery of these cells forms a continuous, intact macrostructure whose stability is independent of the membrane bilayer or filamentous cytoskeletal elements, and thus has the properties of a membrane skeletal structure. Although not yet directly demonstrated, the results also strongly suggest that this peripheral layer is composed of the previously described set of plasma membrane matrix proteins. This article discusses possible roles for this proposed membrane skeletal structure in stabilizing the membrane bilayer and affecting the dynamics of other membrane proteins.
