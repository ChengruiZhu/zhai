The presence of cardiovascular comorbidities is frequently associated with poor outcomes in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). No clear role has been defined for cardiac biomarkers in acute exacerbations of COPD (AECOPD). The aim of this systematic review was to examine the prognostic value of brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) and troponins in patients with AECOPD. Two independent authors searched the PubMed and Cochrane Library to collect clinical trials, observational studies and meta-analyses studying the prognostic value of cardiac biomarkers in AECOPD. The reference lists of all the included studies were also reviewed. A total of 14 studies were included in the review, of which 10 measured troponins, 7 measured BNP or NT-proBNP, and 3 measured both. Of the studies that used mortality in AECOPD as an end point, some but not all found that elevated BNP and/or troponins were associated with increased mortality. Of the studies that used left ventricular (LV) dysfunction in AECOPD as an end point, all found a significant association between elevated BNP and troponins in the diagnosis of LV dysfunction. In summary, it appears that there may be a link between an elevated level of BNP or NT-proBNP and increased cardiovascular mortality in AECOPD, although the data currently available are not conclusive. The inconsistencies in biomarkers measured, time points of measurements and the variability in outcome measured preclude more robust analysis.
