 annual BTEC meeting was held in Banff, AB, Canada, on June 27 – 29, 2017. The meeting focused on the intersection between epidemiology and precision medicine, that is, the use of molecular indicators of risk, early disease and prognosis or precision epidemiology. While traditional epidemiologic approaches group large numbers of participants for statistical power, precision epidemiology is founded on the uniqueness and biology of individual disease characteristics. With this in mind, plenary speakers described the molecular heterogeneity of adult and pediatric brain tumors and how those characteristics are currently being used to guide therapy and etiologic research. Rare subtypes and novel mechanisms for recruitment of individuals for research on brain tumors were discussed along with concepts and methodology related to biological and etiologic heterogeneity. The incorporation of relevant molecular classifiers into population registries was emphasized for its role in future research endeavors, ensuring the accessibility of such tools for researchers and clinicians seeking to improve the lives of individuals with brain tumors and those at risk. The next BTEC meeting will be held in Copenhagen, Denmark, in June 2018.
