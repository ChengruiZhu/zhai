 was evaluated using CellTiter 96 Aqueous One Solution Cell Proliferation Assay kit. The apoptotic effect of the drugs was evaluated by double staining with Annexin-V-fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) and propidium iodide (PI). The results demonstrated that the expression levels of ERCC1 mRNA were correlated with the chemosensitivity of platinum agents, and depletion of ERCC1 sensitized the relatively resistant MKN45 cells to cisplatin and oxaliplatin. Univariate analyses revealed that patients with low ERCC1 levels had longer relapse-free survival (RFS) and overall survival (OS) than those with high ERCC1 levels (median RFS, 18 vs. 7 months, P=0.001; median OS, 27 vs. 11 months, P=0.001). Multivariate analyses suggested that high ERCC1 expression is an independent prognostic marker of poor RFS [hazard ratio (HR), 2.16; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.09–4.25; P= 0.026] and OS (HR, 2.21; 95% CI, 1.07–4.55; P=0.031). These results suggest that overexpression of ERCC1 is correlated with platinum drug resistance in gastric cancer cells, and that depletion of ERCC1 sensitizes gastric cancer cell lines to cisplatin and oxaliplatin. Gastric cancer patients with low levels of ERCC1 expression demonstrate a benefit from oxaliplatin-based adjuvant chemotherapy.
