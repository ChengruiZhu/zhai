Colonic lipomas are rare benign tumors. Colonic intussusception is an uncommon complication of colonic lipoma. The current study presents an unusual case of a 4-cm symptomatic lipoma of the transverse colon causing colonic intussusception. A 65-year-old female was admitted to Wenzhou Central Hospital (Wenzhou, Zhejiang, China) with intermittent pain in the left abdomen that had been present for two weeks. Colonoscopy revealed a 4Ã—5-cm intraluminal spherical mass with erosional mucosa 60 cm above the anal verge, indicating the presence of a malignant gastrointestinal stromal tumor. Contrast-enhanced computed tomography revealed a well-defined fatty tissue mass of 4 cm in diameter in the distal transverse colon proximal to the splenic flexure, with intussusception. The patient underwent segmental resection of the transverse colon and intraoperative frozen sections were obtained. The intraoperative frozen sections revealed a submucosal lipoma of the transverse colon and thus, a conclusive diagnosis was achieved. The patient was followed up for one year and 10 months following the segmental resection of the transverse colon, with a good prognosis. This study may increase clinical awareness with regard to colonic lipomas. Furthermore, open surgery combined with use of intraoperative frozen sections should be recommended for large symptomatic colonic lipomas accompanied by colonic intussusception, thus avoiding unnecessary radical resection and improving patient prognosis.
