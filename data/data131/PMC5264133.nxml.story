 hybridization and immunohistochemistry were used to detect the expressions of miR‐181b and TLR4 in HEKs of healthy skin, psoriatic lesional skin and non‐lesional skin respectively. The 3′ untranslated region (3′UTR) of TLR4 combined with miR‐181b was verified by a dual‐luciferase reporter assay. Western blotting and bromodeoxyuridine were applied for corresponding detection of TLR4 expression and cell mitosis. The expression of miR‐181b in HEKs of psoriatic lesional skin was less than healthy skin and psoriatic non‐lesional skin. In psoriatic lesional and non‐lesional skin, TLR4‐positive cell rates and the number of positive cells per square millimetre were higher than healthy skin. The dual‐luciferase reporter assay verified that miR‐181b targets TLR4. HEKs transfected with miR‐181b mimics had decreased expression of TLR4, along with the decrease of mitotic indexes and Brdu labelling indexes. However, HEKs transfected with miR‐181b inhibitors showed increased TLR4 expression, mitotic indexes and Brdu labelling indexes. HEKs transfected with both miR‐181b inhibitors and siTLR4 had decreased mitotic indexes and Brdu labelling indexes. These results indicate that miR‐181b can negatively regulate the proliferation of HEKs in psoriasis by targeting TLR4.
