We have previously shown that Met activation through the hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) increases tumorogenesis, induces epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and chemoresistance in SCLC. We sought to evaluate circulating HGF levels in SCLC patients and assess correlation with outcome and EMT features in the tumor. Serum samples from patients with SCLC were prospectively obtained at diagnosis, response evaluation and progression. HGF serum (sHGF) was quantified by ELISA. EMT markers and p-Met/Met were assayed by immunohistochemistry in tumor samples. Clinical data were prospectively recorder. One-hundred twelve patients were included. High baseline levels of sHGF were associated with shorter overall survival (p=0.007) and remained independently associated with survival in the multivariate analysis (p=0.016). For stage IV patients, an increase of sHGF levels at response evaluation (p=0.042) and at progression (p=0.003) were associated with poor outcome. sHGF levels were associated (p<0.05) with a mesenchymal phenotype in the tumor. In conclusion, high sHGF at diagnosis and increases during the course of the disease predict for poor outcome in SCLC patients and associate with EMT in the tumor. These data provide novel evidence on a role of sHGF in the adverse clinical behavior of SCLC and support testing Met inhibitors in patients with high sHGF.
