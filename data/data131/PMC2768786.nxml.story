A diploid zygote arises by fusion of two haploid gametes. The specific cell division leading to haploid gametes with haploid chromosome number, accompanied by recombination of genetic material, is called meiosis. It is essential for sexually reproducing eukaryotes. During meiotic prophase, shortly after DNA replication, programmed DNA double-strand breaks mark the initiation of recombination. In budding yeast, the protein responsible for DNA double-strand break formation, Spo11, creates a covalent DNA-Spo11 intermediate, which needs to be removed for subsequent recombination. Presumably, asymmetric endonucleolytic cleavage of DNA next to bound Spo11 leads to distinct DNA ends in budding yeast and mouse. Here we show that the fission yeast Spo11 homolog Rec12 is removed by endonucleolytic cleavage as well. However, only a single oligonucleotides class can be detected suggesting symmetric cleavage. We show that Rec12 removal depends on Ctp1 and the MRN-complex. Furthermore, we applied this new method to monitor DNA double-strand break repair in mutants. Until now, pulsed-field gel electrophoresis was used to monitor global DNA double-strand break formation and repair. The assay presented here provides a new tool to monitor global DNA double-strand break processing only.
