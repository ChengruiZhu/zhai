410 patients were included in this study. The average age was 27 Â± 8.8 years (range of 14-59 years). 58.5% of patients had a BMI >25. 70.5% of the patients were male. 27.3% of patients were treated within 3 months of injury, 23.6% between 3-6 months, 18% between 6-12 months, 24.1% between 12-60 months, and 6.9% >60 months (Table 1). Male gender and older age were significant predictive factors for delaying ACL surgery (P < .01). Male gender was significantly associated with presence of lateral meniscus tear (LMT) (P < .001) and lateral femoral condyle (LFC) injury (P< .01). The 40+ age group was significantly more likely to have an medial femoral condyle (MFC) injury (P < .01), medial tibial plateau (MTP) injury (P < .001), lateral tibial plateau (LTP) injury (P < .01), and patellofemoral (PF) injury (P < .001) as compared to those <20 years old. Patients with BMI >25 were significantly more likely to have an MFC injury (P< .05). There was a significant correlation of medial meniscus tear (MMT) with MFC and MTP injury (P < .001, OR 4.8; P < .05, OR 2.6). There was also a significant correlation of LMT and LTP injury (P < .05, OR 2.0). An increase in the presence of MMT was seen in longer delay to time of surgery (P < .001). When compared to the < 3 months group, the 6 to < 12 months group (OR 2.1), the 12 to < 60 months group (OR 4.2) and the 60 months or greater group (OR 6.2) were more likely to have a MMT. A similar trend was seen with MFC injury (P < .001) in the 6 to < 12 months group (OR 2.7), the 12 to < 60 months group (OR 3.1), and the 60 months or greater group (OR 8.3). Presence of LTP injury and LFC injury was also significantly increased with surgical delay, but this association did not occur until 12 to < 60 months (P < .05; OR 5.6) and 60 months or greater (P < .001; OR 21.5) (Figure 1).
