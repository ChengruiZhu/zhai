Genomic DNA is associated with histone proteins to form the basic structure of chromatin. Lysine residues within the N-terminal end of histones H3 and H4 can be methylated, which may have a positive or a negative effect on the activity of associated DNA or genes, depending on the position of the lysines in the histones. Histone lysine methylation can be reversed by histone demethylases. However, it is not very clear how the specificity of histone demethylases to different histone lysines is determined. In this work we have identified a rice histone demethylase, namely JMJ703, which specifically demethylates methylated histone H3 lysine 4. We found that loss of the enzyme reduces cell division rate of the stem and the size of plant stature, indicating the importance of the protein in plant growth. The crystal structure of the catalytic domain of the protein shares a general similarity with that of mammalian and yeast proteins that demethylate methylated histone H3 lysine 9 and lysine 36, but displays several distinct structural features that are important for substrate and cofactor binding and enzymatic activity of the protein. We found that key amino acids involved in the specific structures are conserved within known H3 lysine 4 demethylases, which may be involved in the specificity to histone H3 lysine 4.
