Proteins and other biomolecules are not static but are constantly in motion. Moreover, they possess intrinsic collective motion patterns that are tightly linked to their functions. Thus, an accurate and detailed description of their motions can provide deep insights into their functional mechanisms. For large protein complexes with hundreds of thousands of atoms or more, an atomic level description of the motions can be computationally prohibitive, and so coarse-grained models with fewer structural details are often used instead. However, there can be a big gap between the quality of motions derived from atomic models and those from coarse-grained models. In this work, we solve an important problem in protein dynamics studies: how to preserve the atomic-level accuracy in describing molecular motions while using coarse-grained models? We accomplish this by developing a novel iterative matrix projection method that dramatically speeds up the computations. This method is significant since it promises accurate descriptions of protein motions approaching an all-atom level even for the largest biomolecular complexes. Results shown here for a large molecular chaperonin demonstrate how this can provide new insights into its functional process.
