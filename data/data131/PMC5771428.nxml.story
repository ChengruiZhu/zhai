A number of experimental investigations utilizing different murine species have previously reported: (i) that standard mouse-diets supplemented with physiologically realistic amounts of neurotoxic metal salts substantially induce pro-inflammatory signaling in a number of murine tissues; (ii) that these diet-stimulated changes may contribute to a systemic inflammation (SI), a potential precursor to neurodegenerative events in both the central and the peripheral nervous system (CNS, PNS); and (iii) that these events may ultimately contribute to a chronic and progressive inflammatory neurodegeneration, such as that which is observed in Alzheimer’s disease (AD) brain. In these experiments we assayed for markers of SI in the blood serum of C57BL/6J mice after 0, 1, 3 and 5 months of exposure to a standard mouse diet that included aluminum-sulfate in the food and drinking water, compared to age-matched controls receiving magnesium-sulfate or no additions. The data indicate that the SI markers that include the pro-inflammatory cytokines interleukin-6 (IL-6) and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFα), the acute phase reactive protein C-reactive protein (CRP) production and a triad of pro-inflammatory microRNAs (miRNA-9, miRNA-125b and miRNA-146a) all increase in the serum after aluminum-sulfate exposure. For the first time these results suggest that
