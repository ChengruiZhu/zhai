 (Bt) make ideal bioinsecticides because of their high potency against certain insects and lack of activity against most other species. Transgenic cotton and maize expressing pore-forming Cry1A Bt-toxins are now widely used in agriculture, enabling substantial reductions in the use of chemical insecticides. However this has greatly increased the selection pressure in pest populations for toxin resistance. Preventing or delaying the development of this resistance is a high priority, to avoid a replay of the onset of insecticide resistance brought on by dependency on chemical pesticides. Because the molecular details of Bt mode of action are still not fully understood, insect strains collected from the field and selected to high levels of resistance in the laboratory are useful in discovering the obstacles the toxin must overcome before it finally forms the pore and kills the insect. We used a genetic approach to explore a poorly understood step in the toxin mode of action, which is blocked in an extremely resistant strain of an important cotton pest. As well as providing the tools to diagnose this type of resistance when it appears in the field, this discovery suggests factors that may counteract its eventual spread.
