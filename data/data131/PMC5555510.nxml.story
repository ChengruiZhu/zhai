Eighteen (18) studies meeting the inclusion criteria were identified (Table 1). There were a total of 225 patients with 226 knees who underwent pediatric ACL reconstruction. The average age at surgery was 12.5 years, 86% were male, and the mean post-operative follow up was 45.8 months. The majority of the grafts were hamstring autograft (169 of 226, or 75%). One hundred fifty eight patients (70%) underwent transphyseal reconstructions, 64 (28%) partial transphyseal, and 4 (2%) physeal sparing reconstructions. There were eight (3.5%) re-ruptures prior to skeletal maturity. Sixteen patients (7%) developed angular deformity, of which the majority was valgus deformity (n=13). One patient had valgus and flexion deformity. Two patients had recurvatum, and one patient had both varus and recurvatum deformities. Three patients required osteotomy for realignment and eight (72.7%) were observed. There were 10 patients with at least a 1 cm leg length discrepancy. Six patients with leg length discrepancy were treated with epiphysiodesis (66.7%) and 3 were observed. Two patients who had combined deformities (in multiple planes) were treated with osteotomy. Eight studies reported IKDC scores (range 81-100%) and grades (all either A or B). Five studies reported excellent Lysholm scores with mean scores greater than 94.
