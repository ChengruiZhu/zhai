The responses of neurons in the primary visual cortex (V1), a region of the brain involved in encoding visual input, are modified by the visual experience of the animal during development. For example, most neurons in animals reared viewing stripes of a particular orientation only respond to the orientation that the animal experienced. The responses of V1 cells in normal animals are similar to responses that simple optimisation algorithms can learn when trained on images. However, whether the similarity between these algorithms and V1 responses is merely coincidental has been unclear. Here, we used the results of a number of experiments where animals were reared with modified visual experience to test the explanatory power of three related optimisation algorithms. We did this by filtering the images for the algorithms in ways that mimicked the visual experience of the animals. This allowed us to show that the changes in V1 responses in experiment were consistent with the algorithms. This is evidence that the precepts of the algorithms, notably sparsity, can be used to understand the development of V1 responses. Further, we used our model to propose a novel rearing condition which we expect to have a dramatic effect on development.
