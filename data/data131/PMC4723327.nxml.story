Bone metastases are a common manifestation of malignancy, and external beam radiotherapy (EBRT) effectively and safely palliates the pain caused by this clinical circumstance. The myriad of EBRT dosing schemes and complexities involved with coordinating radiotherapy with other interventions necessitated the need for bone metastases treatment guidelines. Here we compare and contrast the bone metastases radiotherapy treatment guidelines recently published by the American Society for Radiation Oncology (ASTRO) and the American College of Radiology (ACR). These evaluations acknowledge current controversies in treatment approaches, they evaluate the nuances of ASTRO and ACR task force decision-making regarding standard approaches to care, and they project the upcoming research results that may clarify approaches to palliative radiotherapy for bone metastases. The results of these two dedicated radiotherapy guidelines are compared to the brief mentions of radiotherapy for bone metastases in the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) guidelines. Finally, the paper describes how treatment guidelines may influence patterns of care and reimbursement by their use as quality measures by groups such as the National Quality Forum (NQF).
