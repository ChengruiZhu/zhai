 (FCI) was isolated in order to investigate the underlying mechanisms of LIN on MC3T3-E1 cells (a mouse osteoblastic cell line) and the osteoprotective effect of LIN in mice which had undergone an ovariectomy (OVX). The results revealed that LIN enhanced osteoblast proliferation and differentiation in MC3T3-E1 cells dose-dependently, with enhanced alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity and mineralization of extracellular matrix. LIN upregulated osteogenesis-related gene expression, including that of ALP, runt-related transcription factor 2 (RUNX2), osteocalcin (OCN), bone sialoprotein (BSP), and type I collagen (COL-I). Pretreatment with noggin, a bone morphogenetic protein-2 (BMP-2) antagonist, meant that LIN-induced gene expression levels of COL-1, ALP, OCN, BSP and RUNX2 were significantly reduced, as shown by RT-qPCR. Western blot analysis showed that LIN dose-dependently increased the protein levels of BMP-2 and RUNX2 and enhanced the phosphorylation of SMAD1/5. In addition, LIN dose-dependently upregulated protein kinase A (PKA) expression. H-89 (a PKA inhibitor) partially blocked the LIN-induced protein increase in BMP-2, p-SMAD1/5 and RUNX2. We noted that LIN preserved the trabecular bone microarchitecture of ovariectomized mice
