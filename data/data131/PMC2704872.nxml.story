Transmembrane channel proteins are responsible for the transport of ions and molecules through biological membranes and are pivotal for the physiology of the cell. In fact, their incorrect functioning is involved or related to several diseases (diabetes, myotonia, Parkinson's disease, etc.). Moreover, their specificity and selectivity to different ions or molecules have been hypothesized and sometimes shown to strongly depend on the shape and size or amino acid composition of the channel. Therefore, computational methods to identify and quantitatively characterise channel geometry in transmembrane protein structures are key tools to better understand how they function. We have developed PoreWalker, a new method to detect and describe the geometry of these channels in transmembrane proteins from their 3D structures. The method is fully automated, very user-friendly, identifies the location of the channel and derives a number of channel features: diameter profiles at given heights along the channel, all the residues lining the channel walls, size, shape and regularity of the channel. These features can be very helpful in the study of how these channels might function. We have applied PoreWalker to several channel protein structures and were able to identify shape/size/residue features that were representative of specific channel families.
