Immunofluorescence microscopy was used to determine the number of endothelial cells with stress fibers for three age groups, and for three distinct anatomical locations within the descending thoracic aorta of both normotensive and spontaneously hypertensive rats. For each age group examined, hypertensive rats consistently demonstrated greater stress fiber expression than did normotensive rats. Neither age nor blood pressure was the predominant influence on stress fiber expression in aortic endothelium. In the normotensive rats, stress fiber expression remained unchanged for all age groups examined. For both strains, however, more endothelial cells with stress fibers were found in those regions where fluid shear stresses are expected to be high, when compared with those regions where the fluid shear stresses are expected to be low. This observation suggests that anatomical location, with its implied differences in fluid shear stress levels, is a major influence on stress fiber expression within this tissue. Electron microscopy was used to determine the intracellular distribution of stress fibers for both strains. Most stress fibers in both strains were located in the abluminal portion of the endothelial cells. This result is consistent with a role for stress fibers in cellular adhesion. However, the hypertensive rats had a higher proportion of stress fibers in the luminal portion of their cytoplasm than the normotensive rats. This increased presence of stress fibers in the luminal portion of the cell may be important in maintaining the structural integrity of the endothelial cell in the face of elevated hemodynamic forces in situ.
