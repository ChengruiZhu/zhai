. An MTT assay was performed to evaluate the proliferation inhibition of the MG-63 osteosarcoma cell line by curcumol. Fluorescein isothiocyanate-Annexin V/propidium iodide staining flow cytometry was performed to analyze the apoptotic rate of cells. The morphological alterations of cell nuclei were evaluated by Hoechst 33258 viable cell staining. The effects of autophagy in cells was investigated by green fluorescent protein (GFP)-light chain 3 (LC3) transfection and using a fluorescence microscope. The expression levels of LC3II, LC3I and cleaved caspase-3 and Janus kinase (JNK) signaling pathway activation were determined by western blot analysis. Cell proliferation was inhibited by curcumol in a dose- and time-dependent manner. Curcumol induced apoptosis by the caspase-dependent signaling pathway in MG-63 cells. The present study demonstrated that curcumol could induce autophagy of MG-63 cells, which was evaluated by transmission electron microscopy. Compared with the curcumol treatment alone group, the GFP-LC3-transfected green fluorescence plasmids and the LC3II/LC3I levels in cells of the curcumol and chloroquine (CQ) treatment group were upregulated, and the apoptotic ratio was downregulated following pretreatment with autophagy inhibitor CQ for 1 h. Furthermore, curcumol treatment induced phosphorylation of the JNK signaling pathway. Of note, pretreatment with the JNK inhibitor, SP600125, decreased the rates of autophagy and apoptosis, suggesting a crucial role served by the JNK signaling pathway in the activation of autophagy by curcumol. Taken together, the results of the present study suggested that activation of the JNK signaling pathway was involved in curcumol-induced autophagy. Curcumol is a novel drug for chemotherapeutic combination therapy. Curcumol demonstrated potential antitumor activities in MG-63 cells and may be used as a novel effective reagent in the treatment of osteosarcoma.
