Natural killer (NK) cells are innate immune cells that are important in our bodies' initial defenses against pathogens, like viruses. NK cells rapidly proliferate early during viral infections to provide an expanded pool of effector cells to suppress the infection. This proliferative response is driven by a cytokine called interleukin-15 (IL-15); however, the influence of IL-15 and its receptor (IL-15R) in stimulating NK cell proliferation has not been quantitatively characterized at the cellular level. To better understand the factors controlling the vigorous expansion of NK cells during infections, we developed a mathematical model incorporating IL-15R binding and trafficking parameters that regulate the number of cell-surface IL-15/IL-15R signaling complexes. The analysis of this model provided us with insight on how IL-15-driven NK cell expansion can be modulated through changes in receptor kinetics and expression. Based on model predictions, we were able to draw inferences about NK cell population dynamics and to compare these conclusions with quantitative experimental results. Our results and model have applicability to studies designed to manipulate cell responses in the context of immunotherapies.
