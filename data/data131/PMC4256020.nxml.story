All organisms are dependent on the proper replication of their DNA for survival. DNA polymerase is the enzyme responsible for copying our DNA during cell division. We have performed computational simulations on DNA polymerase to understand the fundamental dynamics of the enzyme. Our simulations provide new information about the way polymerase moves in solution that is not obtainable through traditional experimental techniques. In particular, we investigated the dynamics of DNA polymerase “opening” in the binary state (enzyme+DNA with no nucleotide substrate) starting from three different conformations. The results are consistent with available experimental data on the relative conformations of DNA polymerase in the binary state. Furthermore, we identified a novel intermediate species that we hypothesize plays a role in the dynamics of nucleotide substrate binding. Additionally, we determined the previously unknown ordering of events in the opening mechanism, and suggest new details about how the polymerase may interact with an incoming nucleotide substrate. Lastly, this research serves as a proof of principle that we can use our methodology to perform long-time scale computational simulations on DNA polymerase to explain currently unknown phenomena surrounding DNA replication.
