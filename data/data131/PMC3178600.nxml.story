High-density microarrays measuring single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) provide information about the genotypes across many loci. SNP genotypes observed for any two individuals can be compared in terms of identity-by-state (IBS), in which two individuals are observed to have 0, 1, or 2 alleles in common at a given locus, across a chromosomal region, or throughout the genome. These alleles may be shared identical-by-descent (IBD) in which 0, 1, or 2 alleles are inherited from a recent common ancestor, or they may be identical by chance because the allele is frequent in the population. The expected proportion of genome sharing between two individuals varies as a function of their genetic relatedness. We introduce a method to estimate IBD that can be used to analyze relatedness in pedigrees or in large-scale population studies with thousands of individuals. This can be combined with observed IBS to distinguish a variety of types of relatedness, providing theoretically justified results that are graphed in a manner that is straightforward to interpret. The methods we introduce are relevant to a variety of SNP applications including linkage and association studies and population genomics studies.
