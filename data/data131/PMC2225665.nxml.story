 The various contractile and control sites of natural actomyosin gel were studied by comparing the kinetics of ATP hydrolysis with those of gel contraction, measured as an increase in turbidity. Contraction of actomyosin gel seems to require the cooperative reaction of ATP (with Mg) at two different sites. One of these sites catalyzes the hydrolysis of ATP and most probably contributes the driving force for contraction; the binding of ATP to the other site appears to break certain links that retard movement of the gel components. At limiting concentrations of ATP, the rate of contraction seems to depend on the rate of breaking these links as well as on the rate of ATP hydrolysis. But when both sites are saturated, the rate of contraction appears to be limited only by the rate of ATP hydrolysis. In addition to these two contractile sites, there are also two different control sites. At one, the relaxing site, the binding of ATP with Mg inhibits ATP hydrolysis and gel contraction. At the other, the binding of calcium activates contraction by overcoming the inhibitory action of Mg and ATP at the relaxing site. This control system—inhibition by substrate and disinhibition by calcium—can be selectively inactivated by heat and reactivated by dithiothreitol, a disulfide-reducing agent. These observations on the isolated contractile system are discussed in relation to the contraction and relaxation of muscle.
