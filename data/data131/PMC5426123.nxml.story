Biomarkers to predict the altering physiological conditions over the period leading toward the ocular disorders are of major importance in therapeutics. Isolation and validation of the biomarkers specific to ocular diseases are a challenging task. Glaucoma is a neurodegenerative disease of the eye where the correlation of biomarkers in circulating fluid may be made specific for the eye. However, conditions such as wet age-related macular degeneration (AMD) and proliferative diabetic retinopathy (DR), circulating biomarkers might be having some degree of overlap with other conditions like cancer where a common factor such as angiogenesis is involved. Diabetes, a systemic disorder affecting the target organs such as eye, kidney, heart, and nervous system can be predicted using common circulating biomarkers. However, these markers need to be validated along with various stages of disease progression to enable the possibility of targeted pharmacological interventions apart from good glycemic control alone. This review compiles the attempts made to correlate such circulating biomarkers in the ocular conditions such as glaucoma, AMD, and DR in the search for a surrogate marker for diagnostic and prognostic value. To make biomarkers for the common convenience, genetic markers are excluded from this review.
