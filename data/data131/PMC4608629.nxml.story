We describe a case with macular hole (MH) associated with Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada (VKH) disease. A 71-year-old Japanese woman presented with visual loss and headaches. The best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) was 0.02 in the right eye (RE) and 0.1 in the left eye (LE). The patient was diagnosed with VKH based on circumferential choroidal detachments, multiple serous retinal detachments, and optic disc hyperemia. The multiple serous retinal detachments improved with high-dose corticosteroid therapy and gradual tapering. The BCVA was recovered to 1.2/0.7 in the RE/LE. Six weeks after the initial administration of steroid, vitreomacular traction was found by optical coherence tomography in the LE, which progressed to stage 4 MH with the BCVA of 0.2 in the LE. Twenty-three weeks after the initial treatment, vitrectomy was performed with the standard surgical procedures, including inner limiting membrane peeling around the fovea and air tamponade. The MH was closed successfully and the BCVA was 0.4 in the LE 5 weeks after the vitrectomy. This is the first report of a case with MH secondary to the acute uveitic stage of VKH. Successful closure of MH was achieved with the standard surgical intervention for an idiopathic MH. To conclude, at the early stage of VKH, there is a possibility of MH formation due to the rapid progress of vitreous traction following the inflammation, and the surgical procedure could be effective to resolve this secondary disorder.
