The effects of neonatal antigen exposure on the adult B cell repertoire have been examined by characterizing the influenza hemagglutinin (HA)- specific response of adult BALB/c mice given antigen soon after birth. Ligand exposure during early life exerts a profound and lasting effect upon the B cell repertoire, characterized by the expansion and preservation of particular antigen-reactive clones and the apparent loss of others. The precise subset of clonotypes selectively preserved depends upon the age at which antigen is first encountered; and is predictable given a knowledge of the emerging primary pool's dynamics and composition. The preserved (secondary) B cells differ from their unprimed precursors with respect to (a) expression of the surface marker detected by the monoclonal antibody J11d, and (b) susceptibility to T cell-mediated suppression. These studies thus demonstrate a strong relationship between the heritable dynamics of the emerging primary B cell repertoire and the effect of ligand-driven events upon repertoire phenotype. In addition, they provide a mechanistic model for certain forms of antigen-induced oligoclonal dominance, especially the phenomenon of original antigenic sin.
