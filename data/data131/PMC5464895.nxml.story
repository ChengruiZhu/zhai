Several studies have reported reduced miRNA-199a-3p (miR-199a-3p) in different human malignancies, however, little is known about miR-199a-3p in cholangiocarcinoma cells. In this study, we demonstrate the essential role and mechanism of miR-199a-3p in regulating cisplatin sensitivity in cholangiocarcinoma cell lines. Using a CCK-8 cell counting assay we found that expression of miR-199a-3p was positively correlated with cisplatin sensitivity in cholangiocarcinoma cell lines. MiR-199a-3p overexpression could decrease the proliferation rate and increase apoptosis of cholangiocarcinoma cells in the presence of cisplatin, while miR-199a-3p inhibition had the opposite effect. Further study demonstrated that mTOR was the target gene of miR-199a-3p, and that miR-199a-3p mimics could inhibit expression of mTOR, which consequently reduced the phosphorylation of its downstream proteins 4EBP1 and p70s6k. Rescue experiments proved that miR-199a-3p could increase the cisplatin sensitivity of cholangiocarcinoma cell lines by regulating mTOR expression. Moreover, we also found that miR-199a-3p overexpression could reduce cisplatin induced MDR1 expression by decreasing the synthesis and increasing the degradation of MDR1, thus enhancing the effectiveness of cisplatin in cholangiocarcinoma. In conclusion, miR-199a-3p could increase cisplatin sensitivity of cholangiocarcinoma cell lines by inhibiting the activity of the mTOR signaling pathway and decreasing the expression of MDR1.
