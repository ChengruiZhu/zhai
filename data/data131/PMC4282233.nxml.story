 from Gochang (GOCHANG), Incheon (INCHEON) and a Chinese site (CHINESE), were amplified by PCR. Here, the seven oligonucleotide decamer primers (BION-66, BION-68, BION-72, BION-73, BION-74, BION-76, and BION-80) were used to generate the unique shared loci to each population and shared loci by the three cyclina clam populations. As regards multiple comparisons of average bandsharing value results, cyclina clam population from Chinese (0.763) exhibited higher bandsharing values than did clam from Incheon (0.681). In this study, the dendrogram obtained by the seven decamer primers indicates three genetic clusters: cluster 1 (GOCHANG 01~ GOCHANG 07), cluster 2 (INCHEON 08~INCHEON 14), cluster 3 (CHINESE 15~CHINESE 21). The shortest genetic distance that displayed significant molecular differences was between individuals 15 and 17 from the Chinese cyclina clam (0.049), while the longest genetic distance among the twenty-one cyclina clams that displayed significant molecular differences was between individuals GOCHANG no. 03 and INCHEON no. 12 (0.575). Individuals of Incheon cyclina clam population was somewhat closely related to that of Chinese cyclina clam population. In conclusion, our PCR analysis revealed a significant genetic distance among the three cyclina clam populations.
