A retrospective study was performed on data from patients who underwent TKA without primary patellar resurfacing from 2004 to 2012 in an university affiliated hospital. The study cohort included 784 patients (m:f=302:482, mean age at surgery±SD 71±10) operated with TKA during this period. Five different cruciate-retaining TKA systems were used in consecutives series. These were the following: A) Triathlon, Stryker, Switzerland (n=296), B) PFC Sigma, DepuySynthes, Switzerland (n=215), C) LCS, DepuySynthes, Switzerland (n=80), D) Balansys, Mathys, Bettlach, Switzerland (n=129), E) Duracon, Stryker, Switzerland (n=64). Data was retrospectively obtained from our different hospital archives. Patients demographics, age at surgery, type of total knee arthroplasty were noted. In addition, the data were screened for a secondary resurfacing in each patient. On anterior-posterior, lateral and skyline view radiographs different measurements were performed. TKA component position was assessed on radiographs with respect to "The knee society total knee arthroplasty roentgenographic evaluation and scoring system (TKA-RESS). Pearson Chi square test was used to compare differences between groups (p<0.05). There was no significant difference between the groups in terms of age, gender, and radiological outcomes.
