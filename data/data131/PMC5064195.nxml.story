Pleomorphic dermal sarcoma (PDS) is a rare mesenchymal neoplasm sharing histopathological features with atypical fibroxanthoma (AFX), but has additional features of deep invasion of the superficial subcutis, tumor necrosis and vascular/perineural invasion. It is not well documented in the literature because of its rarity, and its clinical course has been debated due to the lack of homogenous criteria. We describe here the case of a 91-year-old female with a 6-month history of a solitary, asymptomatic, well-defined, 3.4-cm-sized, reddish, hard, protruding mass on the lateral aspect of the right upper eyelid. On the basis of initial punch biopsy results, storiform cellular infiltrate of pleomorphic spindle and polygonal cells with frequent atypical mitoses, the lesion was identified as AFX. Following the initial biopsy, micrographic surgery was performed and a tumor-free margin was confirmed. Considering the conservation of the periocular function and the advanced age of the patient, we planned secondary intention healing rather than primary suturing. After surgery, skeletal muscle infiltration was found and the diagnosis was revised to PDS by a pathologist based on the currently accepted criteria for PDS. There has been no evidence of recurrence or periocular functional defects during a 2-year follow-up without adjuvant therapy. Although the PDS is highly malignant, complete excision under micrographic surgery can prevent recurrence without adjuvant therapy. Also, the secondary intention healing is an effective method for closure of large defects on the face.
