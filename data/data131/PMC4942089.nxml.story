One of the riddles of Nature is how cells interact with one another to create complex cellular networks such as the neural networks in the brain. Forming precise connections between irregularly shaped cells is a challenge for biology. We developed computational methods for simulating these complex cell-cell interactions. We applied these methods to investigate yeast mating in which two yeast cells grow projections that meet and fuse guided by pheromone attractants. The simulations described molecules both inside and outside of the cell, and represented the continually changing shapes of the cells. We found that positioning the secretion and sensing of pheromones at the same location on the cell surface was important. Other key factors for robust mating included secreting a protein that removed excess pheromone from outside of the cell so that the signal would not be too strong. An important advance was being able to simulate as many as five cells in complex mating arrangements. Taken together we used our novel computational methods to describe in greater detail the yeast mating process, and more generally, interactions among cells changing their shapes in response to their neighbors.
