An ideal ear, with representation of all anatomic landmarks, is the aim of any reconstructive surgeon embarking on reconstructing the ear in a microtia patient. The literature is abundant with the description of techniques, but these have been reported mainly in Caucasian and Oriental population. There have been very few publications on results in the population belonging to the Indian subcontinent. In spite of strictly adhering to the recommended techniques of reconstruction, the results obtained in these patients have often been marred by problems that are not reported with the Oriental or Caucasian populations. This may necessitate a relook into the management strategy of these cases. Hindering the assessment of the results, their reporting and auditing the improvement obtained by such change in the management strategy, is the lack of a standardized method for assessment of the outcome. Hence, an attempt was made in a series of patients who underwent microtia reconstruction to assess the outcome using a new tool based on the attained definition of anatomical components of the reconstructed pinna. Further effort was made to document the modifications in the technical execution of the reconstruction during the period of the study.
