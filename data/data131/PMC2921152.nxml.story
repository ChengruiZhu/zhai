Different cell types in multi-cellular organisms are determined by the repertoire of genes active in each cell. This repertoire, or transcriptome, is established by the coordinated activity of transcription factors and cofactors that form modular transcription complexes. The modular nature of transcription complexes complicates our understanding of how transcription factors shape the transcriptome. CHIP/LDB transcription complexes direct formation of various cell types including blood and nerve cells. CHIP/LDB malfunction leads to developmental defects and cancer. The function of these complexes depends critically on the docking of specific transcription factors and co-factors at a specific time and in a specific cell type, making them outstanding models for intricate transcriptional regulation. Here we demonstrate that loss of SSDP, a key regulatory component of CHIP/LDB transcription complexes, alters transcription of a large group of genes. We used bioinformatics tools and genetic tests to examine the function of additional components of CHIP/LDB transcription complexes and their target genes during the development of specific organs. We demonstrate how differences in the availability of transcription factors in different cells can affect the function and composition of CHIP/LDB transcription complexes.
