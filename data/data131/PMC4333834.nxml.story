Microtubules are cylindrical machines inside biological cells, and are crucial for many functions such as chromosome segregation, intra-cellular transport, and cell motility. They are made of 13 elastic filaments (protofilaments) that can be either in a straight or in a curved conformation depending on the chemical state of the constituent tubulin molecules. The interplay between these two conformations help microtubules to display a fascinating phenomenon known as “dynamic instability,” in which the microtubule steadily self-assembles and catastrophically disassembles in a seemingly random process. During the disassembly, the protofilaments are known to curve out forming ram’s horn-like structures. Scientists have been trying to understand how the laws of mechanics and statistical thermodynamics determine the complex behavior of microtubules. In this paper, we investigate how the chemical bonding between protofilaments, bending elasticity of protofilaments, and thermal forces determine the speed of the disassembly of the microtubule cylinder. We show that the current notion of a bending-elasticity dominated disassembly will lead to a paradox; resolving the paradox, we argue that the disassembly is a result of an intricate molecular orchestration in which the thermal and curvature energies of protofilaments compete with inter-protofilament bonding energy leading to curving out and depolymerization.
