Resveratrol (RV) is a natural polyphenol compound with a wide range of activities, including inhibition of human bladder cancer (HBC) cell growth. Because RV is rapidly metabolized and has poor bioavailability, it is unclear whether the antitumor activity is due to RV or its metabolites. We therefore used liquid chromatography-mass spectroscopy, qRT-PCR, immunocytochemistry and western blotting to evaluate the metabolic profile and biotransformation of RV in the T24 and EJ HBC cell lines. Both T24 and EJ cells generated the same RV metabolite, RV monosulfate (RVS), and both exhibited upregulation of the RV-associated metabolic enzyme SULT1A1 (sulfotransferase). Despite these similarities, T24 cells were more sensitive to RV than EJ cells, yet T24 cells exhibited no sensitivity to an RVS mixture (84.13% RVS). Primary rat bladder epithelial cells showed no adverse effects when exposed to a therapeutic dose (100 Î¼M) of RV. The differences in RV sensitivity between the two HBC cell lines did not reflect differences in the RV metabolic profile or SULT1A1 expression. Because RV exhibited stronger antitumor activity and better safety than RVS, we conclude that RV has significant therapeutic potential for HBC treatment, provided individual differences are considered during clinical research and application.
