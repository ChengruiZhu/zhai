Several studies indicate that plasma adiponectin levels are associated with the risk of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) or T2DM risk factors in diverse populations. In addition to the adiponectin gene, several other genes have been postulated to influence plasma adiponectin levels. In this study, we investigated two single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), rs4311394 and rs4783244, located intronically in the ADP-ribosylation factor-like protein 15 (ARL15) and the T-cadherin (CDH13) genes, respectively. These SNPs were detected in a Han Chinese population using a TaqMan assay and evaluated for association with T2DM as well as with individual metabolic traits. Allele frequencies for rs4311394 were significantly different in T2DM and nondiabetes (NDM) groups (χ² = 4.49, P = 0.034). However, neither allele nor genotype frequencies for rs4783244 were associated with T2DM (χ² = 0.33, P = 0.56 and χ² = 2.35, P = 0.31 respectively). The SNPs did not exhibit significant association with individual metabolic traits in the T2DM and NDM groups. Our results indicated that the G allele of the rs4311394 might be a susceptibility factor for T2DM in the Han Chinese population (odds ratio: 1.20; 95% confidence interval: 1.01-1.41).
