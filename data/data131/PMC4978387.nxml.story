Brain imaging techniques are broadly divided into the two categories of structural and functional imaging. Structural imaging provides information about the static physical connectivity within the brain, while functional imaging provides data about the dynamic ongoing activation of brain areas. Computational models allow to bridge the gap between these two modalities and allow to gain new insights. Specifically, in this study, we use structural data from diffusion tractography recordings to model functional brain connectivity obtained from fast EEG dynamics occurring at the alpha frequency. First, we present a simple reference procedure which consists of several steps to link the structural to the functional empirical data. Second, we systematically compare several alternative methods along the modeling path in order to assess their impact on the overall fit between simulations and empirical data. We explore preprocessing steps of the structural connectivity and different levels of complexity of the computational model. We highlight the importance of source reconstruction and compare commonly used source reconstruction algorithms and metrics to assess functional connectivity. Our results serve as an important orienting frame for the emerging field of brain network modeling.
