The increased use of next-generation sequencing for neurological patients has led to a growing catalog of patient-ascertained variants in N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) subunits, which play important roles in normal brain development and have been implicated in epilepsy, language disorders, motor disorders, learning disorders, autism, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, developmental delay, and schizophrenia. Studies that provide functional analysis of the mutant proteins produced by missense mutations are lacking. Here, we use the largest currently available sample of human standing variation to illustrate the landscape of missense intolerance within the GluN1, GluN2A and GluN2B subunits, and provide the first evaluation of the molecular mechanisms of mutations in NMDAR pre-M1 helix that links the agonist binding domain to the channel pore in patients with epilepsy and/or intellectual disability. This region of the subunit is depleted of missense variants in the healthy population, which from the population genetics view, is consistent with what we would expect if mutations in these regions were associated with severe disorders. Our functional results suggest that mutations in this region of the receptor have profound effects on receptor and neuronal function, which may contribute to patient symptoms and could contribute to neuronal damage. This finding further suggests that evaluation of strategies to treat patients with similar mutations in NMDAR that are neurotoxic may preserve grey matter.
