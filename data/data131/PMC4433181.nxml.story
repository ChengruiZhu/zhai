The study of ion channels is essential both for understanding normal brain function and for finding drug targets to treat neurological disease. Traditional experimental techniques remain challenging for recording ion channel currents accurately because of their locations in the neuron. Computer modeling of the three dimensional structure of neurons can provide a correction estimate for the measurement error introduced by neuronal membranes. To achieve this, we developed a modeling approach to localize, and correct for, distant ion channels. We demonstrated this approach by constructing novel computer models of an identified insect motor neuron, which provides a powerful model for studying the central nervous system. Through the study of electrical activity and genetic manipulations, it has been found that the persistent sodium current contributes to seizure. By modeling three dimensional structure, we were able to predict the location of these currents in the neuron, which were more distal than expected. Localizing sodium channels allowed us to predict their properties at origin, which favorably matched isolated recordings of these channels in more compact cells. This result is important in validating the use of heterologous compact cells to study insect sodium channels, and also demonstrates the usefulness of the presented modeling approach for studying channel physiology more generally.
