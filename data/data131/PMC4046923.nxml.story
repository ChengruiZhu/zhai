The centrosome helps cells to divide, and is important for the development of animals. It has its evolutionary origins in the basal body, which was present in the last common ancestor of all eukaryotes. Here, we study how the evolution of novel proteins helped the formation of the centrosome. Coiled-coil proteins are important for the function of the centrosome. But, they have repeating patterns that can confuse existing methods for finding related proteins. We refined these methods by adjusting for the special properties of the coiled-coil regions. This enabled us to find more distant relatives of centrosomal proteins. We then tested how novel proteins affect the protein interaction network of the centrosome. We did this by removing the most novel proteins step by step. At each stage, we observed how the remaining proteins are connected to the centriole, the core of the centrosome. We found that coiled-coil proteins that first occurred in the ancestor of fungi and animals help to recruit older proteins. By being recruited to the centrosome, these older proteins acquired new functions. We thus now have a clearer picture of how the centrosome became such an important part of animal cells.
