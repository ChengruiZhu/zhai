 1. While several reports of photosensitive pigments from the retinas of animals possessing large numbers of cone cells have been published, the only study which could be confirmed was Wald's discovery of iodopsin, a red-sensitive pigment from chicken eyes. 2. In its chemical properties, such as the range of pH stability and the effect of polar organic solvents, iodopsin resembles rhodopsin but is considerably more labile. 3. A partial purification from inert yellow impurities has been effected by prehardening the retinas in pH 4.9 acetate buffer before extraction by 2 per cent digitonin. Rhodopsin was an inevitable contaminant in most methods of extraction, but could be reduced to about 10 per cent of the absorption due to iodopsin by extraction of unhardened retinas with 4 per cent Merck's saponin in ¾ saturated magnesium sulfate for about 1 hour. 4. The rate of bleaching of iodopsin was found to be first order and linear with respect to energy. 5. The bleaching effectiveness spectrum of iodopsin was determined with the aid of color filters of known energy transmission, and shows a maximum at 560 mµ in the yellow green with a lower plateau in the blue. The spectrum is in good agreement with the sensitivity of the human cones except for the wavelength of maximum bleaching effectiveness. The maximum sensitivity of the human cones is found at 540 mµ. 6. Previous reports of changes in pH and inorganic phosphate level of retinas due to bleaching could not be confirmed.
