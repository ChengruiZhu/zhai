After fresh or frozen ovary transplantation, FSH levels return to normal, and menstrual cycles resume by 150 days, coincident with anti-Müllerian hormone rising to higher than normal levels. AMH then returns to well below normal levels by 240 days, remaining as such for many years with nonetheless normal ovulation and fertility. To date, 20 babies have been born in our program from 11 fresh and 13 cryopreserved ovary transplant recipients with a live baby rate of over 70 % (11 babies from fresh and 9 from frozen). Globally, over 70 live births have been reported for both fresh and frozen ovary transplants with an approximate 30 % live birth rate. Given the rapid rise of AMH after the fall of FSH, with a subsequent AMH decrease with retention of ovarian function, it is tempting to speculate the existence of a shared mechanism controlling primordial follicle recruitment, fetal oocyte meiotic arrest, and recruitment in the adult ovary. With the massive recruitment of primordial follicles observed after human ovarian cortical tissue transplantation, which subsides to an extremely low recruitment rate, we will discuss how this phenomenon suggests a unifying theory implicating ovarian cortical tissue rigidity in the regulation of both fetal oocyte arrest and recruitment of follicles in the adult ovary. As the paper by Winkler-Crepaz et al. in this issue demonstrates, our in vivo results are consistent with the in vitro demonstration that primordial follicles in the fetal cortex are “locked” in development, resulting in meiotic arrest, which spares the oocytes from being rapidly lost all at once (Winkler-Crepaz et al.,
