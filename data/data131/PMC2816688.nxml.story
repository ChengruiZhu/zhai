Proteins function through their interactions with other biological molecules, including other proteins. Often times, these interactions underlie cellular processes that go awry in disease. Therefore, modulating these interactions with small molecules is an active area of research for new drugs to treat diseases and new chemical tools to dissect cellular interaction networks. However, targeting protein–protein interactions has proven to be more challenging than the typical drug targets found on individual proteins. Here, we present a computational approach that aims to help in this challenge by identifying regions of protein–protein interfaces that may be amenable to targeting by small molecules. Through a comprehensive analysis of all known protein structures, we identify closely related proteins that in one case bind a protein and in another case bind a small molecule. We find that a significant number of protein–protein interactions occur through surface regions that bind small molecules in related proteins. These “bi-functional” positions, which can bind both proteins and ligands, will serve as an additional piece of structural information that can aid experimentalists in developing small molecules that modulate protein interactions.
