Inflammatory complications of trauma are responsible for more than half of late trauma deaths, but at present it is impossible to predict which patients with major injuries will recover and which will spiral down into MOF and death, because the biological processes that underlie post-injury inflammatory complications are poorly understood. If the changes in gene expression (the process that converts the information encoded in genes into functional proteins) that accompany systemic inflammation could be elucidated, it might be possible to improve the diagnosis of MOF and to develop better treatments for post-trauma inflammatory complications. In this prospective, longitudinal clinical genomics study (part of the Inflammation and Host Response to Injury multi-disciplinary research program [IHRI]), the researchers developed an approach to associate early within-patient gene expression changes with later clinical outcomes. A prospective study is one in which patients with a specific condition are enrolled and then followed to see how various factors affect their outcomes; a longitudinal study analyzes multiple samples taken at different times from individual patients; a clinical genomics study investigates how genes and gene expression affect clinical outcomes.
