Previous studies have reported that adenosine mono-phosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK) activation can enhance osteoblast differentiation and mineralization; however, the underlying mechanism is not fully understood. Autophagy also serves an important role in osteoblast mineralization and bone homeostasis. The present study aimed to explore whether activation of AMPK could enhance osteoblast differentiation and mineralization via the induction of autophagy. The fracture healing and nonunion animal models were established and verified by X-ray imaging. Bone maturation was measured by Masson staining and the expression of AMPK, p-AMPK, microtubule-associated proteins 1A/1B light chain 3B II, and p62 in the fracture ends were detected by immunohistochemical staining. The mRNA expression levels of alkaline phosphatase (ALP), osteocalcin, runt-related transcription factor 2 and BCN1 were determined by reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction. 5-Bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate/nitro blue tetrazolium staining was used to determine ALP activity and alizarin red staining was adopted to examine mineralization. Western blot analysis was performed to detect protein expression. Autophagosome was observed by Transmission electron microscopy. Small interfering (si)RNA was used to knock down the expression of target gene.
