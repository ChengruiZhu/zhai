Cervical cancer is the fourth most common cancer in women worldwide, with a large majority of prevalence (85%) in developing countries. As of 2012, it accounts for 7.5% of all female cancer deaths. Despite its high prevalence, skeletal muscle metastasis from cervical cancer is extremely uncommon. In our extensive literature search, we were able to find only 8 cases where skeletal muscle metastasis was the only site of recurrence. We report a case of a 52-year-old African-American woman with a past medical history of cervical cancer (stage IIIB) who presented with pain and swelling in her left upper arm over the preceding 2 months. MRI of the left upper arm showed a solid well-circumscribed mass measuring 7.0 × 2.8 × 2.5 cm, deep to the biceps. Biopsy of the mass revealed a metastatic squamous cell carcinoma that was p16-positive. PET scan showed that the lesion was the sole site of metastasis. She received local radiation with concurrent chemotherapy. Follow-up MRI 6 months after the completion of therapy showed resolution of the mass. She has remained disease-free for the last 24 months as evidenced by a PET/CT scan in May 2016. In this case report, we discuss the role of imaging and pathology in the diagnosis of a solitary metastatic lesion. This case also emphasizes the importance of a close follow-up which aids in early intervention, increasing overall survival.
