Oxytalan fibers are distributed in the eye and periodontal ligaments (PDL). The ciliary zonule, known as Zinnâ€™s zonule, in the eye is composed of oxytalan fibers, which are bundles of microfibrils consisting mainly of fibrillin-1 and fibrillin-2. As turnover of oxytalan fibers is slow during life, their degradation mechanism remains unclarified. This study was performed to examine degradation pattern of fibrillin-1 and fibrillin-2 by experimental MMP activation. We cultured human non-pigmented ciliary epithelial cells (HNPCEC) and PDL fibroblasts for 7 days, then treated them with concanavalin A to activate matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-2, and examined the degradation of fibrillin-1 and fibrillin-2 for 72 hr using immunofluorescence. At 7 days of HNPCEC culture, fibrillin-1-positive fibers were observed, some of which merged with fibrillin-2. After MMP-2 activation, fibrillin-1-positive fibers became thin and disappeared by 72 hr, while fibrillin-2-positive fibers disappeared almost completely within 24 hr. At 7 days of PDL fibroblast culture, fibrillin-1-positive fibers were mostly merged with fibrillin-2. After MMP-2 activation, fibrillin-1-positive fibers became thin by 24 hr and had almost disappeared by 48 hr, while fibrillin-2-positive fibers decreased constantly after 24 hr. A MMP-2 inhibitor completely suppressed these degradations. These results suggest that the patterns of fibrillin-1 and fibrillin-2 degradation differ between the eye and the PDL, possibly reflecting the sensitivity of fibrillin-1 and fibrillin-2 of each type of oxytalan fiber against MMP-2.
