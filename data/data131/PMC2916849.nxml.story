Various organismal traits, including the morphology of multicellular species and metabolism in unicellular species, are determined by the amount and combinations of proteins in the cell. The complex regulatory network plays an important role in controlling the protein profiles in a cell. Recent studies have revealed that gene regulatory networks have many interesting structural and mutational features such as their scale-free structure, mutational robustness, and evolvability. However, why and how these features have emerged from evolution is unknown. In this paper, we constructed an evolutionary model of gene regulatory networks and simulated its evolution under various environmental conditions. The results show that most features of known gene regulatory networks evolve as a result of adaptation to unpredictable environmental fluctuations. In addition, some internal organismal factors, such as mutational bias, gene expression costs, and constraints on expression dynamics, are also important for GRN evolution observed in real organisms. Thus, these GRN features appear to evolve as a result of not only adaptation to unpredictable environmental changes but also non-adaptive processes owing to the properties of the organisms themselves.
