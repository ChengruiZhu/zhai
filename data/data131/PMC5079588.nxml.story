The majority of pathologies leading to blindness are related to diseases of the photoreceptors, such as retinitis pigmentosa (RP). A wide variety of different methods are being developed in the attempt to partially restore vision in blind people, including a retinal prosthesis that uses electrical stimulation of the retina to elicit neural responses in the visual pathway. However, restoring appropriate function to the retina does not necessarily imply that the patients can see again, given that plasticity of the primary visual cortex retained by the adult brain is limited, especially after many years of blindness. Here, we followed the sight recovery process in adult patients with the retinal implant Argus II using changes in blood oxygen levels as a readout of neural activity. The recovery of vision depended on the amount of time and practice the subject experienced with the implant, implying that the reorganization process takes time to develop. Importantly, we observed that subjects who used the prosthetic implant the most were also the ones whose response along thalamic visual pathways and the primary cortex increased before and after sight restoration. Overall, these results suggest that there is residual plasticity in adult subjects and that the adult brain can learn to “see” using an artificial visual input.
