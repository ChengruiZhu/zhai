The dosimetric characteristics for modern computer‐controlled linear accelerators with the same make, model, and nominal energy are known to be very similar, as long as the machines are unaltered from the manufacturer's original specifications. In this preliminary study, a quantitative investigation of the similarity in the basic photon dosimetry data from the Siemens Primus linear accelerators at eight different institutions is reported. The output factor, percentage depth dose (PDD), and in‐air off‐axis factor (OAF) for the 6 and 18 MV photon beams measured or verified by the Radiological Physics Center (RPC) were analyzed. The RPC‐measured output factors varied by less than about 2% for each field size. The difference between the maximum and minimum RPC‐verified PDD values at each depth was less than about 3%. The difference between the maximum and minimum RPC‐measured in‐air OAF was no more than 4% at all off‐axis distances considered in this study. These results strongly suggest that it is feasible to establish a reference photon dosimetry data set for each make, model, and nominal energy, universally applicable to those machines unaltered from the manufacturers' original specifications, within a clinically acceptable tolerance (e.g.,
