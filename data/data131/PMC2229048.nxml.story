Intramembrane charge movement was measured on skeletal muscle fibers of the frog in a single Vaseline-gap voltage clamp. Charge movements determined both under polarized conditions (holding potential, VH = - 100 mV; Qmax = 30.4 +/- 4.7 nC/micro(F), V = -44.4 mV, k = 14.1 mV; charge 1) and in depolarized states (VH = 0 mV; Qmax = 50.0 +/- 6.7 nC/micro(F), V = -109.1 mV, k = 26.6 mV; charge 2) had properties as reported earlier. Linear capacitance (LC) of the polarized fibers was increased by 8.8 +/- 4.0% compared with that of the depolarized fibers. Using control pulses measured under depolarized conditions to calculate charge 1, a minor change in the voltage dependence (to V = -44.6 mV and k = 14.5 mV) and a small increase in the maximal charge (to Qmax = 31.4 +/- 5.5 nC/micro(F] were observed. While in most cases charge 1 transients seemed to decay with a single exponential time course, charge 2 currents showed a characteristic biexponential behavior at membrane potentials between -90 and -180 mV. The voltage dependence of the rate constant of the slower component was fitted with a simple constant field diffusion model (alpha m = 28.7 s-1, V = -124.0 mV, and k = 15.6 mV). The midpoint voltage (V) was similar to that obtained from the Q-V fit of charge 2, while the steepness factor (k) resembled that of charge 1. This slow component could also be isolated using a stepped OFF protocol; that is, by hyperpolarizing the membrane to -190 mV for 200 ms and then coming back to 0 mV in two steps. The faster component was identified as an ionic current insensitive to 20 mM Co2+ but blocked by large hyperpolarizing pulses. These findings are consistent with the model implying that charge 1 and the slower component of charge 2 interconvert when the holding potential is changed. They also explain the difference previously found when comparing the steepness factors of the voltage dependence of charge 1 and charge 2.
