Hepatitis E is an infectious inflammatory disease of the liver caused by the hepatitis E virus (HEV), a single-stranded RNA virus. Today, it is estimated that there are more than 20 million HEV infections every year, leading to 3.3 million symptomatic cases and more than 56,000 deaths. For a long time it was believed that HEV was a travel-associated disease, endemic in developing countries with poor hygienic standards and unsafe water supply. However, over the past years, publications have demonstrated that autochthonous HEV infections in industrialized countries are far more common than previously thought. Awareness for HEV amongst health care practitioners in industrialized countries is still limited. This relatively rare disease is of great importance, especially in immunocompromised patients where it can cause chronic liver disease. This article comprehensively reviews current literature to give an overview on clinically important topics. It will focus on epidemiological aspects, acute and chronic HEV infection as well as extra-hepatic manifestations, diagnostic approach and treatment options. Furthermore, the article is concluded with a brief outlook on perspectives and urgent problems to be addressed in the future.
