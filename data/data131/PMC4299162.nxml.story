The aim of this study was to verify if hyoid myotomy without hyoid suspension is effective in surgical treatment of obstructive sleep apnoea syndrome (OSAS). We recruited six patients with OSAS, aged between 34 to 60 years, with retropalatal and retrolingual upper airway obstruction, non-obese (BMI < 27) and non-compliant to continuous positive airway pressure therapy. Pre-surgical clinical and instrumental evaluations included clinical examination, cephalometry, polysomnography (PSG) and sleep endoscopy. Surgical treatment included nasal surgery, uvulopalatopharyngoplasty, tonsillectomy and hyoid myotomy without hyoid suspension. Follow-up evaluations were performed with serial PSGs, performed early (one week after surgery), and at 1, 6 and 18 months after surgery. We observed that surgery was followed by immediate normalisation of breathing parameters evaluated by PSG that persisted after 18 months. Thus, hyoid myotomy without suspension combined with nasal and palatal surgery may be considered a valid treatment of non-obese OSAS patients with retrolingual and retropalatal collapse. Furthermore, we suggest that hyoid bone suspension, binding it to mandibular or to thyroid cartilage, might be unnecessary in selected cases.
