Thirty hips were included in 29 patients. 24 of the patients were female. Average age at revision was 16.6 (range 15-18). 21 of the patients had one prior surgery, 6 had 2 prior surgeries and 2 had 3 prior surgeries. Mean time from most recent surgery to revision surgery was 18.7 months (range 4.7 to 74 months). Surgeries prior to presentation included 13 with labral debridement, 11 with labral repair, 7 had both cam and pincer addressed, 4 had cam only, 1 had pincer only. 18 patients did not have femoroacetabular impingement (FAI) addressed. 5 patients had iliopsoas releases. At revision, lysis of adhesions was performed on all patients. 12 had labral reconstruction, including 9 of the initial labral debridement patients. 18 underwent cam and pincer resection, including 13 of those without FAI addressed initially. 8 patients had labral repair. 3 patients had iliopsoas release and 1 had iliotibial band release. One patient underwent a periacetabular osteotomy without further arthroscopy. At an average follow-up of 37 months (range 24 to 52 months), the mHHS improved from 57 (25 to 96) to 82 (45 to 96). Mean improvement was 22 points (p<0.001). The median satisfaction was 7 (1 to 10), median Tegner was 5 (1 to 9), SF12 PCS was 50.8 (37.2 to 58.3) and the SF12 MCS was 52.8 (45. to 63.6)
