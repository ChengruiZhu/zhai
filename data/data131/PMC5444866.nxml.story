Technological advances now allow us to observe gene expression in real-time at a single-cell level. In a wide variety of biological contexts this new data has revealed that gene expression is highly dynamic and possibly oscillatory. It is thought that periodic gene expression may be useful for keeping track of time and space, as well as transmitting information about signalling cues. Classifying a time series as periodic from single cell data is difficult because it is necessary to distinguish whether peaks and troughs are generated from an underlying oscillator or whether they are aperiodic fluctuations. To this end, we present a novel tool to classify live-cell data as oscillatory or non-oscillatory that accounts for inherent biological noise. We first demonstrate that the method outperforms a competing scheme in classifying computationally simulated single-cell data, and we subsequently analyse live-cell imaging time series. Our method is able to successfully detect oscillations in a known genetic oscillator, but it classifies data from a constitutively expressed gene as aperiodic. The method forms a basis for discovering new gene expression oscillators and quantifying how oscillatory activity alters in response to changes in cell fate and environmental or genetic perturbations.
