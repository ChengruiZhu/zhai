 were studied after fixation in buffered osmium tetroxide and after applying Novikoff and Goldfischer's method (15) for demonstrating thiamine pyrophosphatase (TPPase) activity both with the light and the electron microscope. The appearance of cells in the light microscope after localizing the enzyme is very similar to the appearance after the application of classical Golgi techniques. The electron microscope shows the "dictyosomes" to consist of non-granular membranes, vesicles, and vacuoles typical of the ultrastructure of the Golgi apparatus. Sites of TPPase activity are localized by deposits of lead phosphate, and are found between the membranes of the Golgi apparatus, in the small vesicles, in multivesicular bodies often found associated with it, but not within the large Golgi vacuoles. Heavy deposits are found on the caudal part of the nuclear envelope, but not in the acrosomal granule. It is suggested that TPPase may act as an intermediary in acrosome formation by the Golgi apparatus or "acroblast" of this cell. The finding of diphosphatase activity in the Golgi apparatus of an invertebrate is suggested as additional evidence for the existence of a homology between the Golgi apparatus of all animal cells.
