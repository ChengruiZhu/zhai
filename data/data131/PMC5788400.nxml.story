The surgical repair of atlantoaxial instabilities (AAI) presents complex and unique challenges, originating from abnormalities and/or trauma within the junction regions of the C1-C2 atlas-axis, to surgeons. When this region is destabilized, surgical fusion becomes of key importance in order to prevent spinal cord injury. Several techniques can be utilized to provide for the adequate fusion of the atlantoaxial construct. Nevertheless, many individuals have less than ideal rates of fusion, below 35%-40%, which also involves the C2 nerve root being sacrificed. This suboptimal and unavoidable iatrogenic complication results in the elevated probability of complications typically composed of vertebral artery injury. This review is a retrospective analysis of 87 patients from Cedars Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles, California, who had the C1-C2 surgical fusion procedure performed within the time frame from 2001 to 2008, with a mean follow-up period of three years. These patients had presented with typical AAI symptoms of fatigability, limited mobility, and clumsiness. Diagnosis of C1-C2 instability was documented via radiographic studies, typically utilizing computed tomography (CT) scans or x-rays. All patients had bilateral C1 lateral masses and C2 pedicle screws. In addition, the C1-C2 joint was accessed by retracting the C2 nerve root superiorly and exposing the joint by utilizing a high-speed burr. The cavity that is developed within the joint is packed with local autologous bone from the cephalad resection of the C2 laminae. Fusion of the C1-C2 joint was achieved in all patients and a final follow-up was conducted approximately three years postoperative. Of the 87 patients, two presented with occipital headaches resulting from the C1 screws impinging on the C2 nerve root. The issue was rectified by removing instrumentation in both patients after documenting complete fusion via radiographic studies, with complete resolution of symptoms. No vertebral artery or spinal cord injuries were reported as a result of the minor complication. Overall, we aim to describe a safe and reliable alternative technique to fuse C1-C2 instability by focusing on intra-articular arthrodesis complementing instrumentation fixation. This methodology is advantageous from a biomechanical standpoint secondary to axial loading, as well as the large surface area available for arthrodesis. Additionally, this technique does not involve the resection of the C2 nerve root, resulting in low risk for vertebral artery or spinal cord injury.
