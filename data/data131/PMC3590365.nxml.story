 ~250 nmol/L. CCN2-stimulated phosphorylation of Akt and GSK-3β was sensitive to inhibition of PI3-kinase (LY294002). Phosphorylation of GSK-3β was also sensitive to Akt-inhibition (API-2), demonstrating CCN2-engendered activation of a PI3-kinase/Akt/GSK-3β-signaling pathway. A C-terminal peptide fragment of CCN2 (11.2 kD) displayed partial agonist activity, while two short peptides derived from the Thrombospondin- and the IGFBP- homology domains of CCN2, respectively, additively inhibited rhCCN2-stimulated Akt-phosphorylation. The viability of cardiac myocytes subjected to hypoxia/reoxygenation injury or doxorubicin-induced oxidative stress was assessed by assays of adenylate kinase and lactate dehydrogenase released from dying cells. Cardiac myocytes exposed to CCN2 displayed increased tolerance towards hypoxia/reoxygenation and doxorubicin-induced oxidative stress, an effect that was abrogated by inhibition of PI3-kinase. The cytoprotective actions of CCN2 reflected in the transcriptome of CCN2-stimulated cardiac myocytes (anti-apoptosis, stress, and wound-response gene programs). In conclusion, this study discloses the novel findings that cardiac myocytes are CCN2 target cells in which CCN2 increases tolerance towards hypoxia and oxidative stress via PI3-kinase-dependent Akt/GSK-3β signaling.
