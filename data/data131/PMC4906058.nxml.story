 Polynuclear aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) from oil were present in some shrimp from Port Valdez, site of a ballast water treatment facility at the Alyeska Alaska Marine Terminal (AMT). Low-level petrogenic PAH concentrations were generally restricted to shrimp eggs in the vicinity of the AMT and extended along the southern shore of Port Valdez to Anderson Bay. Eggs had greater lipid content than other tissues and thus were the most vulnerable biological compartment to hydrocarbon accumulation. Petrogenic hydrocarbons were not observed in shrimp muscle and cephalothoraxes; thus, these tissues do not pose a human health risk. Risk for children older than age 2 years and adults consuming eggs also was low except for two unusual samples (of 32), collected about 17 km west of the treatment facility. In general, PAH loads were consistent with local time series data in other species. We infer that the accumulation mechanism was dissolved uptake from water, consistent with passive sampler observations completed more than a decade earlier. Hydrocarbon levels in the majority of samples were below toxic thresholds. Total PAH accumulation was substantially greater in some pink shrimp than in other species, thus differences in habitat utilization (muddy vs. rocky substrate) are potentially important.
