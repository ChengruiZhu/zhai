Accumulating evidence has indicated that microRNA-181 (miR-181) is dysregulated in hematological malignancies, and associates with the clinical outcomes. However, the association of miR-181 expression levels with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) remains inconclusive, as publications from different groups have reported contradictory results. In this manuscript, a meta-analysis was performed to assess the prognostic significance of miR-181 in AML patients. Eligible studies were retrieved from PubMed, Embase and Cochrane Library databases, and a total of 6 studies including 815 AML patients were included in the final analysis. Hazard ratios (HRs) and their corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were extracted and pooled to investigate the correlation between miR-181 and the survival of AML patients. Our results showed that elevated miR-181 expression was associated with increased survival in 395 American patients, and reduced survival in 325 Chinese patients. Both subgroup analyses and meta-regression indicated that the origin of AML patients contributed to the heterogeneity in the datasets evaluating the correlation between overall survival (OS) and miR-181. These results indicate that miR-181 can be used as a promising prognostic biomarker in AML patients, which may depend on the origin of patient population.
