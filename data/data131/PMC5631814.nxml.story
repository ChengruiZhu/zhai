During 2006–2016, 3352 blood samples were sent for serology to the reference laboratory, 205 (6.1%) were positive for Q fever. We observed an increase in positive results from 1.3 to 3.7% in 2007–2011 to 3.9–7.3% during 2012–2015, and up to 41% in 2016. Full data was available for 153 patients. Ninety-nine patients (65%) were male, median age was 50 years, and half of the patients had no comorbidities. The patients presented with fever in 85% of the cases, a respiratory symptom in 58%, rash was present in 7%. Anemia was present in 46 patients (30%), but leukopenia and thrombocytopenia were less common (6 and 16%, respectively). Liver enzymes were elevated in 29 patients (19%), and 49 patients (32%) had pneumonia according to chest X-ray. Seventeen patients had risk factors for a chronic disease: three of those had chronic infection at presentation, four patients had an appropriate follow-up; one patient developed a chronic disease shortly after the acute infection. Three patients died from other severe medical conditions and seven patients were not followed up. Although only 46 patients (30%) were discharged with a diagnosis of either Q fever or unspecified rickettsial disease, 74 (48%) were treated with doxycycline.
