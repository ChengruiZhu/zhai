 and increased overall survival in a Burkitt lymphoma (BL) xenograft non-obese diabetic severe combined immunodeficiency gamma (NSG) model. In this study we compared the phosphoproteomic changes by pathway analysis following obinutuzumab vs RTX against RTX-sensitive (Raji) and -resistant BL (Raji4RH). Phosphoproteomic analyses were performed by mass-spectrometry (MS)-based label-free quantitative phosphoproteomic profiling. We demonstrated that 418 proteins in Raji and 377 proteins in Raji 4RH, were differentially phosphorylated (>1.5-fold) after obinutuzumab vs. RTX. Proteins that were significantly differentially phosphorylated included the B cell antigen receptor (BCR) (PLCG2, BTK and GSK3B), Fc gamma phagocytosis (FCRG2B, MAPK1, PLCG2 and RAF1), and natural killer cell-mediated cytotoxicity (MAPK1, RAF1, PLCG2 and MAPK3) signaling pathways. Differential phosphorylation of BCR or cytotoxicity pathway proteins revealed significant up-regulation of BTK, PLCY2 and ERK1/RAF1 after obinutuzumab compared to RTX. Silencing of PLCG2 in the BCR and MAPK1 in the cytotoxicity pathway significantly increased BL proliferation and decreased BL cytotoxicity after obinutuzumab compared to RTX. These results in combination with our previous results demonstrating a significant improvement in
