For many patients optimal perioperative care may require little or no additional medical management beyond that given by the anaesthetist and surgeon. However, the continued existence of a group of surgical patients at high risk for morbidity and mortality indicates an ongoing need to identify such patients and deliver optimal care throughout the perioperative period. A group of patients exists in whom the risk for death and serious complications after major surgery is in excess of 20%. The risk is related mainly to the patient's preoperative physiological condition and, in particular, the cardiovascular and respiratory reserves. Cardiovascular management of the high-risk surgical patient is of particular importance. Once the medical management of underlying disease has been optimized, two principal areas remain: the use of haemodynamic goals to guide fluid and inotropic therapy, and perioperative β blockade. A number of studies have shown that the use of goal-directed haemodynamic therapy during the perioperative period can result in large reductions in morbidity and mortality. Some patients may also benefit from perioperative β blockade, which in selected patients has also been shown to result in significant mortality reductions. In this review a pragmatic approach to perioperative management is described, giving guidance on the identification of the high-risk patient and on the use of goal-directed haemodynamic therapy and β blockade.
