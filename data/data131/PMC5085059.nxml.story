Unlike somatic cells, which feature two different cohesin complexes, in spermatocytes at least six distinct cohesin complexes form, whose concerted functions are little understood. This study focuses on three meiosis-specific cohesins. Meiosis features specific chromosome structures and dynamics, and we revealed individual contributions of meiotic cohesin complexes to chromosome axes length, centromeric cohesion, telomere integrity and synapsis. The only meiosis-specific SMC protein, SMC1β, was removed leaving only complexes based on the universal SMC1α. In addition to SMC1β, either one of the two meiosis-specific kleisins REC8 or RAD21L, proteins that close the cohesin ring-like structure, were eliminated. “Double-knockout” mutants were compared to the single “knockouts” and wild-type. Telomeres and chromosome synapsis are impaired to different degrees in all mutants. In early prophase I prominent roles of meiosis-specific cohesins are in axis length and synapsis rather than centromeric cohesion. Removal of SMC1β and RAD21L almost completely abolishes all chromosome axes. Centromeric cohesion is initially provided by SMC1α complex(es). Later in meiosis, SMC1β ensures centromeric cohesion, suggesting functional replacement of SMC1α. Thus, different cohesin complexes in spermatocytes contribute distinctly to different structures and processes in these cells, but there is also some functional redundancy.
