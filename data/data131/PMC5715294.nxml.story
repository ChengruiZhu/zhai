4869 (5–1200 μg/dose) was administered intradermally every 2 weeks, according to a 3 + 3 dose‐escalation method in higher‐risk (International Prognostic Scoring System score ≥1.5) or lower‐risk (score <1.5) red blood cell transfusion‐dependent patients with myelodysplastic syndrome. Twenty‐six patients were enrolled and treated (median age, 75 years; range, 32 to 89). The most common adverse event was injection site reaction (61.5%). Main grade 3 or 4 adverse events were neutropenia (30.8%), febrile neutropenia, pneumonia, elevated blood creatine phosphokinase levels and hypoalbuminemia (all 7.7%). Dose‐limiting toxicities occurred in 1 patient in the 50 μg/dose cohort (pyrexia, muscle hemorrhage and hypoalbuminemia) and 1 patient in the 400 μg/dose cohort (pneumonitis); however, the maximum tolerated dose could not be determined from this trial. The overall response rate was 18.2%, the disease control rate was 59.1% and median overall survival was 64.71 weeks (95% confidence interval: 50.29, 142.86) as assessed by the Kaplan–Meier method. Subgroup analysis of azacitidine‐refractory patients with higher‐risk myelodysplastic syndrome (11 patients) showed median overall survival of 55.71 weeks (approximately 13 months).
