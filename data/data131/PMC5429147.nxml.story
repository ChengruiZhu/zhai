A 61-year-old woman noticed a right neck lump in October 2001. Fine needle aspiration showed follicular neoplasm, adenoma versus carcinoma. The ultrasound scan showed a solid mass of maximum dimension of 3.7 cm. She had a right thyroid lobectomy and isthmectomy in January 2002 (first surgery). The tissue specimen showed a 4.5 cm Hurthle cell carcinoma (HCC) with vascular invasion. There were no capsular invasion, extra-thyroidal extension, or margin involvement. A completion left lobectomy (second surgery) was performed two weeks later. Therefore the pathological stage is II (T3N0M0). She received adjuvant radioactive iodine ablation for residual thyroid tissue. By 2003, she developed local recurrence, which was resected (third surgery), followed by adjuvant external beam radiotherapy. Unfortunately, she developed further recurrence in the left main bronchus, as identified by Indium-111 Octreotide (Curium, Missouri, USA) and positron emission tomography-computed tomography PET-CT imaging in 2006. She underwent a left pneumonectomy (fourth surgery) in July 2006. In November 2007 she was found to have mediastinal recurrence which was treated with high-dose external beam radiotherapy. She initially responded but developed more local recurrence and a lung metastasis by 2011. She was treated with brivanib with ixabepilone, under a phase I clinical trial with mixed response. Her treatment was discontinued secondary to toxicity and she succumbed to her disease in 2012. This case report illustrates the natural history and clinical decision making for patients diagnosed with HCC of the thyroid. Specifically, we highlight the clinical issues surrounding the histopathological diagnosis, extent of surgical resection, radioiodine diagnostic imaging/ablative treatment, as well as external beam radiotherapy.
