The case of a 45-year-old woman who was admitted to our university hospital for polymenorrhea, weight gain and pain in the left iliac region is reported. An abdominal ultrasound revealed a 9.5 Ã— 5.2-cm, hypoechoic and inhomogeneous mass located on the left side of the pelvis and behind the ovary. The patient underwent surgery. The pelvic mass was firmly anchored to the small intestine, colon, sigma and uterine fundus. After removing the adhesions, double ureters, which had been incorporated in the mass, were observed on the left side. Resection of the unilateral double ureters was necessary in order to remove the entire mass, and thereafter, a left salpingoophorectomy was performed. A histological examination showed a malignant retroperitoneal mass. Termino-terminal ureteral anastomosis with two double-J stents was carried out. Total hysterectomy with preservation of the right adenexum and regional lymphadenectomy was performed. The purpose of this case report is to discuss the physical and psychological implications related to the combination of two rare entities: leiomyosarcoma and a double ureter located within the mass. A literature review on the clinical management and psychological aspects from a female cancer patient's perspective undergoing surgery with the aforementioned disorders will be discussed.
