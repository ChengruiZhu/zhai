Despite advances in the management of non-small cell lung cancer, it remains to be the leading cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide primarily because of diagnosis at a late stage with an overall 5-year survival rate of 17%. A reduction in mortality was achieved by low-dose computed tomography screening of high-risk patients. However, the benefit was later challenged by the high false positive rate, resulting in unnecessary follow-ups, thus entailing a burden on both the health care system and the individual. The diagnostic dilemma imposed by imaging modalities has created a need for the development of biomarkers capable of differentiating benign nodules from malignant ones. In the past decade, with the advancements in high-throughput profiling technologies, a huge amount of work has been done to derive biomarkers to supplement clinical diagnosis. However, only a few of them have efficient sensitivity and specificity to be utilized in clinical settings. Therefore, there is an urgent need for the development of sensitive and specific means to detect and diagnose lung cancers at an early stage, when curative interventions are still possible. Due to the invasiveness of tissue biopsies and inability to capture tumor heterogeneity, nowadays enormous efforts have been invested in the development of technologies and biomarkers that enable sensitive and cost-effective testing using substrates that can be obtained in a noninvasive manner. This review, primarily focusing on liquid biopsy, summarizes all documented potential biomarkers for diagnosis, monitoring recurrence treatment response.
