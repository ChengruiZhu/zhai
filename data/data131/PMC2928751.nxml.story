Protein kinases are enzymes that regulate key cellular processes by covalently attaching a phosphate group to substrate proteins; they are crucial components of signaling pathways involved in cancer, diabetes, and many other diseases. Identifying the substrates of particular protein kinases is challenging, and many existing biochemical methods are biased against weakly expressed proteins like transcription factors. Here we exploited the observation that mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) briefly attach to many of their substrates before phosphorylating them, docking onto a sequence known as the ‘D-site’. We developed D-finder, a computational tool that uses a combination of expert knowledge and machine learning to search genome databases for D-sites. We then verified several of D-finder's predictions using rigorous and well-established biochemical assays. The most intriguing predicted and verified substrates were the Gli1 and Gli3 transcription factors of the ‘hedgehog’ signaling pathway. Gli transcription factors are involved in embryonic development and stem cell differentiation, and have also been found to be hyperactive in several types of cancer. There is emerging evidence that crosstalk with MAPK pathways is important in Gli-mediated regulation. Our study, however, is the first to show that MAPKs directly phosphorylate Gli transcription factors.
