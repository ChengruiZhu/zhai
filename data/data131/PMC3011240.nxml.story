Relationship of neurosis and sexual-behaviour has been a controversial issue to-date. This study was designed to explore (a) whether sexual dysfunctions are responsible for development of neurosis, (b) does neurosis affect sexual-behaviour. In the present study sexual-behaviour of 53 married female neurotics and 32 matched healthy controls was studied. Health subjects were screened by Corncell Medical Index. A sexual-behaviour questionnaire was administered to all subjects. Experimental subjects were enquired about the sexual behaviour at two periods (a) before the onset of neurotic illness, (b) after the co-commencement of neurotic illness. These observations were compared with those of healthy subjects as well as between the two periods. Sexual-behaviour of neurotics was no way different to that of healthy control before the onset of illness. However, after the commencement of illness experimental subjects showed significant decreases in sexual satisfaction (sexual adequacy) in comparison to their pre-illness sexual behavior as well as from that of healthy controls. These results tend to refute the first proposition of holding sexual disturbances responsible for development of neurotic-illnesses but support the notion of presence of sexual-disturbances during illness.
