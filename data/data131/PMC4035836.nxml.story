Herein we assessed the impact of direct autofluorescence during intraoperative work-up on obtaining superficial free resection margins, identifying new areas of malignant transformation and altering disease-free survival and local control at 3 years in patients submitted to transoral laser surgery (TLS) for early glottic cancer. Prospective cohort evaluation was carried out on the diagnostic accuracy of the superficial extent and TNM staging in 73 patients with glottic carcinoma undergoing transoral CO2 laser surgery. The use of direct autofluorescence was associated with superficial disease-free margins in 97.2% of cases, and with superficial close margins in 2.8%. The improvement in diagnostic accuracy was 16.4%; in 8.2% of cases, there was upstaging of the TNM classification (in one case, a second neoplastic area in a different laryngeal site was observed and considered to be a second endolaryngeal primary). The sensitivity of direct autofluorescence was 96.5% with a specificity of 98.5%. Overall, 3-year disease-specific survival and local control with laser alone were, respectively: T1a (97.5%, 100%), T1b (86.7%, 86.7%), T2 (88.9%, 88.9%). This study demonstrates that direct autofluorescence can help to identify positive superficial margins, and has a favourable impact on diseasespecific survival and local control at 3 years.
