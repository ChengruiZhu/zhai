The purpose of the study was to investigate the potential of direct machine parameter optimization (DMPO) to achieve parotid sparing without compromising target coverage in IMRT of oropharyngeal cancer as compared to fluence modulation with subsequent leaf sequencing (IM) and forward planned two‐step arc therapy (IMAT). IMRT plans were generated for 10 oropharyngeal cancer patients using DMPO and IM. The resulting dose volume histograms (DVH) were evaluated with regard to compliance with the dose volume objectives (DVO) and plan quality. DMPO met the DVO for the targets better than IM, but violated the DVO to the parotids in some cases. DMPO provided better target coverage and dose homogeneity than IM and was comparable to IMAT. Dose to the parotids (23Gy) was significantly lower than for IMAT (48Gy), but somewhat higher than for IM (20Gy). Parotid sparing with IM was, however, only achieved at the cost of target coverage and homogeneity. DMPO allows achieving parotid sparing in the treatment of oropharyngeal cancer without compromising target coverage and dose homogeneity in the target as compared to two‐step IMAT. Better overall plan quality can be delivered with less monitor units than with IM.
