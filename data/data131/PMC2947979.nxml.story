At the heart of RNA functionality, maturation, and regulation is the formation of intricate secondary structures that are dependent on specific nucleotide base-pairing interactions encoded within their sequences. These interactions can either be within (intra-molecular) or between (inter-molecular (heteroduplex)) RNA molecules. Although it is clear that secondary structure is abundantly important for the functionality and regulation of RNAs, comprehensive base-pairing interaction data are completely lacking for the majority of these molecules. To address this, we have developed a new approach for studying the base-pairing interactions of RNA molecules by marrying classical nuclease-based structure mapping techniques with high-throughput sequencing technology. We have used this approach to identify known and novel substrates of the base-paired RNA producing enzyme RNA–DEPENDENT RNA POLYMERASE6, reveal conserved functionality within introns and both 5′ and 3′ untranslated regions (UTRs) of mRNAs, uncover a novel population of functional RNAs, and produce a genome-wide collection of RNA secondary structure models by identifying the base-pairing interactions within each RNA molecule. Our findings demonstrate that our methodology should be widely applicable for the identification and analysis of base-paired RNAs in all biological organisms.
