Domain-motif interactions are instrumental for many central cellular processes, and are therefore tightly regulated. Phosphorylation events are known modulators of protein-protein interactions in general, including domain-motif interactions. Here, we addressed the association of phosphorylation and domain-motif interaction taking a motif-centred view. We integrated human domain-motif interaction and phosphorylation data for four representative domains (SH2, WW, SH3 and PDZ), and showed that the adjacency between phosphorylation and domain-motif interactions is extensive, suggesting interesting functional links between them that extend the classical and widely studied phospho-regulation of SH2 or WW domain-motif interactions. Furthermore, we show that such interaction-regulation units may function as double switches, concurrently enabling interaction of the motif with one domain and disabling interaction with another domain. These latter interaction-regulation units are more conserved in evolution than the individual units comprising them. Assuming that the four analyzed domain-motif interaction types are reliable representatives of such interactions, our results support the existence of units comprising motifs and associated phosphorylation sites, in which the regulation of domain-motif interaction is inherent.
