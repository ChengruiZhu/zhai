These findings suggest that increased consumption of fruits and non-starchy vegetables is inversely associated with weight change and that different fruits and vegetables have different effects on weight. The benefits of increased consumption were greater for fruits than for vegetables and strongest for berries, apples/pears, tofu/soy, cauliflower, and cruciferous and green leafy vegetables. Increased satiety with fewer calories could be partly responsible for the beneficial effects of increasing fruit and vegetable intake. These findings may not be generalizableâ€”nearly all the participants were well-educated white adults. Moreover, the use of dietary questionnaires and self-reported weight measurement may have introduced measurement errors into this study and, although the researchers accounted for some key lifestyle factors that are likely to affect weight, individuals who increased their fruit and vegetable intake and lost weight may have shared other unknown characteristics that were actually responsible for their weight loss. Overall, however, these findings provide new food-specific guidance for the prevention of obesity, a primary risk factor for many life-shortening health conditions.
