R loops are co-transcriptional RNA-DNA hybrids that can have a physiological role in transcription and replication, but also may be a major threat to genome stability. To avoid the deleterious effects of R loops, specific factors prevent their formation or facilitate their removal. The double-strand break repair factor BRCA2 is among those that prevent R-loop accumulation. As BRCA2 also protects stalled replication forks and is the FANCD1 member of the Fanconi Anemia (FA) pathway, we studied the role of this pathway in preventing R loop accumulation and R loop-dependent genome instability. Using human and murine cells defective in FANCD2 or FANCA and primary bone marrow cells derived from FANCD2 deficient mice, we show that the FA pathway removes R loops and that many DNA breaks accumulated in FA cells are R loop-dependent. Importantly, FANCD2 foci accumulation is largely R loop-dependent, suggesting that the FA functions at R loop-containing sites. The FA pathway is primarily known as a DNA interstrand crosslinks (ICLs) repair pathway. Our findings reveal a novel function of the FA pathway in preventing R loop-mediated DNA damage, providing new clues to understand the relevance of R-loops as a natural source of genome instability and the way they are processed.
