Proteins that are placed in membranes or secreted are produced in a cellular structure called the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). An accumulation of misfolded proteins in the ER contributes to many disease states, including diabetes and neurodegeneration. The ER protects against a toxic buildup of misfolded proteins by activating the unfolded protein response (UPR), which maintains ER homeostasis by slowing protein synthesis and enhancing ER functions such as protein folding and degradation. Many of these processes are controlled by three canonical ER/UPR gene regulatory factors. Here we identify the gene regulator SKN-1/Nrf as also playing a critical role in the UPR. SKN-1/Nrf is well known for its functions in oxidative stress defense and longevity. We now report that SKN-1/Nrf mobilizes an ER stress gene network that is distinct from its oxidative stress response, and includes regulation of other central UPR factors. Surprisingly, we also find that ER- and UPR-associated mechanisms are needed to “license” SKN-1/Nrf to defend against oxidative stresses. Our findings show that UPR and oxidative stress defense mechanisms are integrated through SKN-1/Nrf, and suggest that this integration may help maintain a healthy balance between ER and cytoplasmic functions, and stress defenses.
