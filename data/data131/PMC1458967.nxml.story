Cells coordinate activities with their neighboring cells by releasing and responding to chemical signals, such as hormones and growth factors. These extracellular signals often are transmitted to the intracellular regulatory machinery through associations of freely diffusing cell surface receptors whose random movement (Brownian motion) results from collisions with thermally agitated lipid molecules. Receptors on the cell surface signaling proteins are co-localized transiently on membrane patches, but how such spatial restriction contributes to signal transduction is unclear. Batada and colleagues set out to determine which is more likely to be the biophysical function of co-localization: increasing coupling efficiency of slowly diffusing membrane proteins or reducing cross talk along pathways with common intermediates. Using a mathematical model to describe Brownian motionâ€“based association of receptors on a 2-D spherical surface, the authors show that the rate of signal transduction initiation is extremely fast compared with the cytoplasmic signal relay events, even when the number of receptors is low. Because enhancement of a process that is already fast is not beneficial to the cell, minimization of detrimental cross talk among pathways is the most likely reason why cells need to co-localize plasma membrane signaling proteins.
