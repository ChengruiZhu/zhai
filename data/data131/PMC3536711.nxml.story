Proteins are linear polymers of a set of typically 20 different amino acid building blocks. The amino acid sequence—encoded by a genetic template—directs the folding of newly synthesized proteins into compact 3D structures and dictates the function of the protein product. Monomers containing distinct physico-chemical properties and geometries allow the formation of highly sophisticated architectures, and diverse functional groups enable enzymes to catalyze a plethora of chemical transformations. Nevertheless, the biochemical rationale for the exact composition (and particularly the redundancy) of the proteinogenic amino acid alphabet, which contains multiple building blocks that are chemically similar, remains enigmatic. By subjecting a simplified enzyme—constructed from only nine different amino acids—to directed evolution, we were able to investigate the impact of amino acid diversity on protein function. The most prolific variant selected in the course of the experiments expanded its amino acid alphabet, albeit through two surprisingly subtle mutations (isoleucine to threonine and leucine to valine). The mutations improve both stability and catalytic activity of the enzyme, thereby demonstrating that the presence of structurally similar amino acids specified by the genetic code is highly beneficial for protein fitness.
