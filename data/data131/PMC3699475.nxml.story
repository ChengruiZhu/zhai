Although eukaryotic gene repression usually acts on individual genes, cells can also repress larger chromosomal regions via the establishment of a high order chromatin structure called heterochromatin. Once initiated, heterochromatin spreads until halted by a boundary, and in this study we focus on how this boundary is formed. Because the mechanism is epigenetic and can differ from cell to cell, we wanted to assess the dynamics of the process by tracking individual cells over multiple generations. Here we develop a novel method employing protein fluorescence to monitor gene expression at the boundaries of several yeast heterochromatic regions simultaneously. This allows us to assess whether different boundaries within a single cell fluctuate in concert or independently of each other. In addition, we use histone modification mutants to probe the specific types of epigenetic regulation responsible for fluctuations in heterochromatin boundary positioning. Using this method, we show that epigenetic gene expression within individual cells is reversible and that this process is regulated by histone acetylation state. Future work will identify connections between variation in boundary positioning and novel transcription control systems.
