 migration and invasion assays were performed in Sinha and Caskie cells. The results demonstrated that, compared with normal cervical tissues, the expression of Msi2 was increased in cervical cancer tissues. The expression of Msi2 was significantly correlated with International Federation of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) stage (P=0.049) and lymph node metastasis (P=0.036). Furthermore, patients with higher Msi2 expression exhibited significantly poorer OS (P=0.013) and PFS (P=0.006) than patients with low Msi2 expression. Notably, high Msi2 expression was correlated with poorer OS in patients with a FIGO stage ≤I (P=0.015), a smaller tumor size (P=0.043) and grade 3 tumor (P=0.002). High Msi2 expression was also correlated with a poorer PFS in patients with a FIGO stage ≤I (P=0.016) and grade 3 tumor (P=0.001). Multivariate analysis suggested that Msi2 expression was an independent prognostic marker of the OS (P=0.027) and PFS (P=0.013) of patients with cervical cancer. Furthermore, Msi2 knockdown significantly (P<0.05) inhibited the invasion and migration of cervical cancer cells. The results of the current study demonstrate that Msi2 may act as a prognostic biomarker in patients with cervical cancer. Targeting Msi2 may therefore offer a promising therapeutic strategy for the treatment of patients with cervical cancer.
