Antibiotic-loaded carriers were developed to fill cavities and locally deliver antibiotics following implantation. However, the most commonly used antibiotic carrier, polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA), has many disadvantages including that it does not promote bone regeneration or conduction. Vancomycin-loaded bone-like hydroxyapatite/poly amino acid (V-BHA/PAA) was successfully fabricated by a homogeneous method, certified as biosafe and known to promote osteogenesis. To evaluate its drug-release features, the quantity of the vancomycin in the elution was obtained every 2 days after in vitro simulated body fluid immersion. The drug concentration in the elution was determined to obtain the drug-release curve. The in vitro drug release was a three-phase process with two release peaks. Its antibacterial activity was evaluated in vitro using an antibacterial zone assay, antibacterial inhibition, and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) observation. Scaffolds of V-BHA/PAA were implanted into a rabbit model of chronic osteomyelitis. The antibacterial activity of the material was evaluated in vivo by gross observations, X-ray, and histological and ultrastructural observations. During the first 48 h, the vancomycin release was more rapid, followed by a period of sustained slow release. Use of V-BHA/PAA could achieve relatively long-term vancomycin delivery of 38 days in vitro and 42 days in vivo. V-BHA/PAA showed a significant and consistent bactericidal effect toward both
