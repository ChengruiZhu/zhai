In recent years, the increasing and rapid spread of pathogenic microorganisms resistant to conventional antibiotics especially in hospital settings spurred research for the identification of novel molecules endowed with antimicrobial activities and new mechanisms of action. Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) received an increasing attention as potential therapeutic agents because of their wide spectrum of activity and low rate in inducing bacterial resistance. Currently, research is focused on the design and optimization of novel AMPs to improve their antimicrobial activity, minimize the cytotoxicity and reduce the proteolytic degradation, also in biological fluids. To this end, the introduction of non-natural amino acids will be a key requisite in order to contrast host resistance and increase compound's life. However, the amino acidic alphabet extension to non-natural elements makes a systematic approach to AMPs design unfeasible. A rational in-silico approach can drastically reduce the number of testing compounds and consequently the production costs and the time required for evaluation of activity and toxicity. In this article, AMP in-silico design with non-natural amino acids was performed and a series of candidates were tested in order to demonstrate the potentiality of this approach.
