Aldosterone is involved in various deleterious effects on the cardiovascular system, including sodium and fluid retention, myocardial fibrosis, vascular stiffening, endothelial dysfunction, catecholamine release and stimulation of cardiac arrhythmias. Therefore, aldosterone receptor blockade may have several potential benefits in patients with cardiovascular disease. Mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists (MRAs) have been shown to prevent many of the maladaptive effects of aldosterone, in particular among patients with heart failure (HF). Randomized controlled trials have demonstrated efficacy of MRA in heart failure with reduced ejection fraction, both in patients with NYHA functional classes III and IV and in asymptomatic and mildly symptomatic patients (NYHA classes I and II). Recent data in patients with heart failure with preserved ejection fraction are encouraging. MRA could also have anti-arrhythmic effects on atrial and ventricular arrhythmias and may be helpful in patient ischemic heart disease through prevention of myocardial fibrosis and vascular damage. This article aims to discuss the pathophysiological effects of aldosterone in patients with cardiovascular disease and to review the current data that support the use of MRA in heart failure.
