Stochastic models of chemical networks are necessary to quantitatively describe random fluctuations and other probabilistic phenomena within living cells. The Chemical Master Equation (CME) describes the time evolution of molecular abundance probabilities in these models, and is a basis for many stochastic simulation and analysis methods. Yet the CME is difficult to solve directly except for very simple structures. Indeed current approaches are susceptible to the curse of dimensionality, that is, the exponential growth of memory and computational requirements in the number of problem dimensions. In this paper, we propose a novel approach that has the potential to overcome the curse of dimensionality. It is based on the use of the recently proposed Quantized Tensor Train (QTT) formatted numerical linear algebra for numerical representation of tensors, using algorithms for basic tensor arithmetics with complexity scaling linearly in the number of reacting species considered, and sub-linearly in the maximum allowed copy number per species. We present this approach and demonstrate its effectiveness by applying it to three problems from systems biology. Numerical experiments are reported which show that several orders of magnitude memory savings is typically afforded by the new approach presented here.
