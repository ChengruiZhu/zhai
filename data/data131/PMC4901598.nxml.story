Measurements demonstrated excellent agreement between raters and across trials (All inter- and intra-rater ICCs ≥ 0.960) for all structures and radiographic views. On the lateral view, the AITFL tibial origin was 9.6 ± 1.5 mm superior and posterior to the anterior tibial plafond (Table 1). Its fibular insertion was 4.4 ± 1.7 mm superior and posterior to the anterior fibular tubercle. The superficial PITFL originated 7.4 ± 1.6 mm superior to the posterior plafond and inserted 22.0 ± 2.3 mm superior and posterior to the lateral malleolus. The corresponding measurements for the deep PITFL were 3.2 ± 1.5 mm superior and 15.4 ± 3.4 mm superior and posterior, respectively. The proximal and distal edges of the ITFL tibial origin were 45.9 ± 7.9 mm and 12.4 ± 3.4 mm proximal to the central aspect of the plafond respectively. The center of the tibiofibular contact area was 8.4 ± 2.1 mm posterior and superior to the anterior plafond. On the mortise view, the AITFL tibial attachment was 5.6 ± 2.4 mm medial and superior to the lateral extent of the plafond and its fibular insertion was 21.2 ± 2.2 mm superior and medial to the lateral malleolus. The corresponding superficial PITFL measurements were 2.7 ± 1.7 mm and 21.5 ± 3.2 mm respectively. The ITFL distal tibial margin was 11.1 ± 3.5 mm proximal to the tibial plafond.
