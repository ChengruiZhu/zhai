In patients with ischemic cardiomyopathy, coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) offers an important therapeutic option but is still associated with high perioperative mortality. Although previous studies suggest a benefit from revascularization for patients with defined viability by a non-invasive technique, the role of viability assessment to determine suitability for revascularization in patients with ischemic cardiomyopathy has not yet been defined. This study evaluates the hypothesis that the use of PET imaging in the decision-making process for CABG will improve postoperative patient survival. We reviewed 476 patients with ischemic cardiomyopathy (LV ejection fraction â‰¤0.35) who were considered candidates for CABG between 1994 and 2004 on the basis of clinical presentation and angiographic data. In a Standard Care Group, 298 patients underwent CABG. In a second PET-assisted management group of 178 patients, 152 patients underwent CABG (PET-CABG) and 26 patients were excluded from CABG because of lack of viability (PET-Alternatives). Primary endpoint was postoperative survival. There were two in hospital deaths in the PET-CABG (1.3%) and 30 (10.1%) in the Standard Care Group (
