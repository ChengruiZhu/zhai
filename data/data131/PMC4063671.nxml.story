The process of decision making involves combining sensory information with statistics collected from prior experience. This combination is more likely to yield ‘statistically optimal’ behavior when our prior experiences conform to a simple and regular pattern. In contrast, if prior experience has complex patterns, we might require more trial-and-error before finding the optimal solution. This partly explains why, for example, a person deciding the appropriate clothes to wear for the weather on a June day in Italy has a higher chance of success than her counterpart in Scotland. Our study uses a novel experimental setup that examines the role of complexity of prior experience on suboptimal decision making. Participants are asked to find a specific target from an array of potential targets given a cue about its location. Importantly, the ‘prior’ information is presented explicitly so that subjects do not need to recall prior events. Participants' performance, albeit suboptimal, was mostly unaffected by the complexity of the prior distributions, suggesting that remembering the patterns of past events constitutes more of a challenge to decision making than manipulating the complex probabilistic information. We introduce a mathematical description that captures the pattern of human responses in our task better than previous accounts.
