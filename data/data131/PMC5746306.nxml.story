Mammalian cardiomyocytes may permanently lose their ability to proliferate after birth. Therefore, studying the proliferation and growth arrest of cardiomyocytes during the postnatal period may enhance the current understanding regarding this molecular mechanism. The present study identified the differentially expressed genes in hearts obtained from 24 h-old mice, which contain proliferative cardiomyocytes; 7-day-old mice, in which the cardiomyocytes are undergoing a proliferative burst; and 10-week-old mice, which contain growth-arrested cardiomyocytes, using global gene expression analysis. Furthermore, myocardial proliferation and growth arrest were analyzed from numerous perspectives, including Gene Ontology annotation, cluster analysis, pathway enrichment and network construction. The results of a Gene Ontology analysis indicated that, with increasing age, enriched gene function was not only associated with cell cycle, cell division and mitosis, but was also associated with metabolic processes and protein synthesis. In the pathway analysis, 'cell cycle', proliferation pathways, such as the 'PI3K-AKT signaling pathway', and 'metabolic pathways' were well represented. Notably, the cluster analysis revealed that bone morphogenetic protein (
