Cellular resistance to platinum anticancer compounds is governed by no less than two molecular processes; DNA repair and cellular accumulation of drug. Gli1 is an upstream regulator of nucleotide excision repair, effecting this process through c-jun. We, therefore, investigated whether Gli1 plays a role in cellular accumulation of cisplatin. Using a Gli1-specific shRNA, we explored the role of Gli1 in the cellular accumulation and efflux of cisplatin, in cisplatin-resistant A2780-CP70 human ovarian cancer cells. When Gli1 is inhibited, cellular uptake of cisplatin was approximately 33% of the level of uptake under control conditions. When Gli1 is inhibited, cellular efflux of cisplatin was completely abrogated, over a 12-h period of observation. We assayed nuclear lysates from these cells, for the ability to bind the DNA sequence that is the Gli-binding site (GBS) in the 5â€²UTR for each of five known cisplatin transmembrane transporters. Four of these transporters are active in cisplatin uptake; and, one is active in cisplatin efflux. In each case, nuclear lysate from A2780-CP70 cells binds the GBS of the respective cisplatin transport gene. We conclude that Gli1 plays a strong role in total cellular accumulation of cisplatin in these cells; and, that the combined effects on cellular accumulation of drug and on DNA repair may indicate a role for Gli1 in protecting cellular DNA from lethal types of DNA damage.
