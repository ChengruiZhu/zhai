Post-menopausal and age-related osteoporosis afflicts large segments of the population and can markedly increase skeletal fragility. Bone fractures that occur as a consequence substantially increase health care expenditures and raise levels of morbidity. While strategies that prevent further loss of bone exist, options that compensate for bone loss accrued over age are less numerous. Physical exercise holds promise in this realm. However, in part due to deficits in how cells within bone respond to skeletal loading, readily complied exercise has proved ineffective in enhancing bone mass in the elderly. In this study, we examined whether the ability of physical exercise to increase bone mass can be restored at advanced age. To this end, we developed a computational model describing how a specific aspect (or pathway) activated in bone cells by skeletal loading may be altered with age. Our model proved successful in describing age-related pathway alterations and identified specific deficits that were amenable to therapeutic manipulation. We subsequently discovered that when an extremely inexpensive, currently approved pharmaceutical is used as a supplement, bone response to skeletal loading was completely rescued in aged animals. We believe that this result provides the rationale to consider this approach as a means to increasing bone mass in the elderly.
