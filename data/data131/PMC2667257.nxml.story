One purchases 100 wineglasses and 100 pairs of pants. After one year, 10 glasses and 10 pants survive. What can be said about the relative quality of the survivors? Well, clothes “die” as a result of accumulated wear; the surviving items are of better quality. The breaking of a wineglass is an external, random event: here the survivors are not the best, but the luckiest. To tell apart the superior from the fortunate, one should examine the development over time: the number of surviving items decays exponentially with time for the glasses and follows a sigmoid curve for the pants. An ongoing argument among macroecologists deals with similar issues. Adaptive theories suggest that the frequent species are the fittest, while the neutral theory explains the observed frequencies as a result of demographic stochasticity, assuming all species to have the same fitness. The histories suggested by the two scenarios are clearly different, but how can one probe the prehistoric abundance of species? In fact, past abundance is reflected in current genetic variance within a population. Here, we present a new technique, based on the Fu-Li F-statistic, which allows one to distinguish between niche and neutral scenarios and to resolve this important debate.
