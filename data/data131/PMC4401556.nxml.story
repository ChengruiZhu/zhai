Animals use an internal brain clock to keep track of time and adjust their behaviour in anticipation of the coming day or night. To be useful, however, this clock must be synchronised to external time. Assessing external time is typically thought to rely on measuring large changes in ambient light intensity that occur over dawn/dusk. The colour of light also changes over these twilight transitions, but it is currently unknown whether such changes in colour are important for synchronising biological clocks to the solar cycle. Here we show that the mammalian blue–yellow colour discrimination axis provides a more reliable indication of twilight progression than a system solely measuring changes in light intensity. We go on to use electrical recordings from the brain clock to reveal the presence of many neurons that can track changes in blue–yellow colour occurring during natural twilight. Finally, using mice housed under lighting regimes with simulated dawn/dusk transitions, we show that changes in colour are required for appropriate biological timing with respect to the solar cycle. In sum, our data reveal a new sensory mechanism for estimating time of day that should be available to all mammals capable of chromatic vision, including humans.
