Responses from hamster parabrachial nuclei neurons to stimulation of the anterior tongue with sucrose, NaCl, HCl, quinine hydrochloride, and the six two-component mixtures of these stimuli were recorded. A cell's response to a mixture approached its response to the mixture's more effective component in the majority of cases, but was sometimes greater or smaller than this response. The best predictor of a neuron's response to a mixture, then, was its response to the mixture's more effective component. The single-component stimulus producing the maximum response was determined for each neuron and the response to this stimulus was compared with the responses evoked by the six mixtures. For 30% of the cells, a mixture elicited a response reliably, but only 1.1-2.1 times greater than the response to the best single- component stimulus. Thus, there were no neurons specialized to respond to these mixtures. The across-neuron patterns elicited by mixtures and the responses of best-stimulus classes to mixtures were studied for comparison with psychophysical data on taste mixtures. Mixtures were usually correlated with single-component stimuli in the mixture, but not with stimuli not in the mixture. In fact, five of the six mixtures fell directly between their components in a multidimensional scaling plot. In addition, a mixture was most effective in stimulating only those classes of neurons maximally stimulated by the mixture's components. These results correlate with psychophysical data suggesting that mixtures of taste stimuli evoke the same taste qualities as evoked by the mixture's components.
