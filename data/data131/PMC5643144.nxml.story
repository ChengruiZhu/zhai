The possibilities of lower antibiotic dosages and treatment times, as demanded by antibiotic stewardship programmes have been investigated with complex mathematical models to account for, for example, the presence of an immune host. At the same time, microbial experiments are getting better at mimicking real setups, such as those where the drug gradually permeates in and out of the region with the infectious population. Our work systematically discusses an extremely simple and thus conceptually easy model for an infectious two species system (one wild-type and one more resistant population), interacting via logistic growth, subject to low and high stress environments. In this model, well-defined timescales exist during which the low stress environment is as efficient in reducing the population as the high stress environment. We explain which temporal patterns of low and high stress, corresponding to sequences of drug treatments, lead to the best population reduction for a variety of durations of high stress within a constant long low stress environment. The complexity of the spectrum of best treatments merits further experimental investigation, which could help clarify the relevant timescales. This could then give useful feedback towards the more complex models of the medical community.
