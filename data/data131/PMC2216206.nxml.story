The relationship between receptor-mediated increases in the intracellular free calcium concentration [( Ca]i) and the stimulation of ion fluxes involved in fluid secretion was examined in the rat parotid acinar cell. Agonist-induced increases in [Ca]i caused the rapid net loss of up to 50-60% of the total content of intracellular chloride (Cli) and potassium (Ki), which is consistent with the activation of calcium-sensitive chloride and potassium channels. These ion movements were accompanied by a 25% reduction in the intracellular volume. The relative magnitudes of the losses of Ki and the net potassium fluxes promoted by carbachol (a muscarinic agonist), phenylephrine (an alpha-adrenergic agonist), and substance P were very similar to their characteristic effects on elevating [Ca]i. Carbachol stimulated the loss of Ki through multiple efflux pathways, including the large-conductance Ca-activated K channel. Carbachol and substance P increased the levels of intracellular sodium (Nai) to more than 2.5 times the normal level by stimulating the net uptake of sodium through multiple pathways; Na-K-2Cl cotransport accounted for greater than 50% of the influx, and approximately 20% was via Na-H exchange, which led to a net alkalinization of the cells. Ionomycin stimulated similar fluxes through these two pathways, but also promoted sodium influx through an additional pathway which was nearly equivalent in magnitude to the combined uptake through the other two pathways. The carbachol- induced increase in Nai and decrease in Ki stimulated the activity of the sodium pump, measured by the ouabain-sensitive rate of oxygen consumption, to nearly maximal levels. In the absence of extracellular calcium or in cells loaded with the calcium chelator BAPTA (bis[o- aminophenoxy]ethane-N,N,N',N'-tetraacetic acid) the magnitudes of agonist- or ionomycin-stimulated ion fluxes were greatly reduced. The parotid cells displayed a marked desensitization to substance P; within 10 min the elevation of [Ca]i and alterations in Ki, Nai, and cell volume spontaneously returned to near baseline levels. In addition to quantitating the activation of various ion flux pathways in the rat parotid acinar cell, these results demonstrate that the activation of ion transport systems responsible for fluid secretion in this tissue is closely linked to the elevation of [Ca]i.
