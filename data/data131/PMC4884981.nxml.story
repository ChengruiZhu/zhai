Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs), which are noncoding RNAs (ncRNAs) with length more than 200 nucleotides (nt), have been demonstrated to be involved in various types of cancer. Consequently, it has been frequently discussed that lncRNAs with aberrant expression in cancer serve as potential diagnostic biomarkers and therapeutic targets. However, one major challenge of developing cancer biomarkers is tumor heterogeneity which means that tumor cells show different cellular morphology, metastatic potential as well as gene expression. In this study, a custom designed microarray platform covering both mRNAs and lncRNAs was applied to tumor tissues of gastric, colon, liver and lung. 316 and 157 differentially expressed (DE-) protein coding genes and lncRNAs common to these four types of cancer were identified respectively. Besides, the functional roles of common DE-lncRNAs were inferred based on their expression and genomic position correlation with mRNAs. Moreover, mRNAs and lncRNAs with tissue specificity were also identified, suggesting their particular roles with regard to specific biogenesis and functions of different organs. Based on the large-scale survey of mRNAs and lncRNAs in four types of cancer, this study may offer new biomarkers common or specific for various types of cancer.
