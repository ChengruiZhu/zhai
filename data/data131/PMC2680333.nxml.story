During viral infection, many essential cellular functions are targets for viral manipulation, yet aside from RNA interference, surprisingly few examples of viruses disrupting RNA turnover have been documented. Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) is an oncogenic virus that induces widespread cellular messenger RNA destabilization during lytic infection. The viral protein SOX is a critical effector of this phenotype, yet it lacks ribonuclease activity, so presumably it targets cellular factors governing RNA stability. Here, we show that SOX stimulates host mRNA destruction via a unique mechanism involving polyadenylation. During SOX expression, newly formed messages have longer than normal poly(A) tails, leading to their retention in the nucleus. Coincident with this hyperadenylation, poly(A) binding protein (PABPC) is relocalized from the cytoplasm to the nucleus. PABPC has prominent roles in translation, messenger RNA stabilization, and quality control in the cytoplasm; we find its nuclear relocalization by SOX correlates with enhanced mRNA turnover in the cytoplasm. Thus, KSHV appears to have evolved distinct polyadenylation-linked mechanisms to target both new messages in the nucleus and preexisting cytoplasmic messages for destruction, thereby effectively inhibiting cellular gene expression.
