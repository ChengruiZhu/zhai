Six patients preparing to undergo tuberosity medialization for recurrent instability were evaluated pre-operatively and one year post-operatively. Procedures performed in combination with medialization included tuberosity anteriorization in five patients, medial patellofemoral ligament (MPFL) reconstruction in five patients, tuberosity distalization in two patients, and lateral retinacular release in two patients. Each patient performed a knee extension exercise without external resistance while lying on the bed of a dynamic CT scanner (Aquilion ONE scanner, Toshiba Medical Systems). Models of the femur, tibia and patella were reconstructed from 5 or 6 volumes of 320 axial images separated by 0.5 mm spanning the extension range. Local coordinate systems were created for each pre-operative bone in the most extended position based on anatomical landmarks. Every other reconstruction of the knee was aligned to the most extended knee by shape-matching the distal femurs. The patella and tibia with the embedded reference axes were copied and individually shape-matched to replace all other pre-operative and post-operative bones. Tibiofemoral and patellofemoral kinematics were quantified at each position of knee flexion. The patellar lateral shift and tilt and the external rotation of the tibia were interpolated to 5°, 10°, 20°, 30°, and 40° of flexion and compared between the pre-operative and post-operative conditions at each flexion angle with a paired t-test.
