Patients with chronic renal failure, especially those on long-term hemodialysis (HD), have a high incidence of premature cardiovascular disease. Oxidative stress, which occurs when there is an excessive free radical production or low antioxidant level, has recently been implicated as a causative factor in atherogenesis. Hourly changes in malondialdehyde (MDA) and antioxidant enzymes, vitamins, lipid profile and ferric reducing ability of plasma (FRAP) were studied with the first use and immediate subsequent reuse of polysulfone dialysis membrane in 27 patients on regular HD treatment. Data were corrected for hemoconcentration and standardized to measure the rate of change. Increase in MDA and erythrocyte catalase along with decrease in plasma vitamin E and FRAP levels and no change in glutathione peroxidase levels were observed as a result of both fresh and reuse dialysis. These findings indicate a net oxidative stress in both fresh as well as dialyzer reuse sessions. There was no significant change in oxidative stress in both fresh and reuse sessions. The oxidative stress with reuse dialysis was less when compared to first use dialysis, but the difference was not statistically significant.
