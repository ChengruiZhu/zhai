Eleven patients (11 eyes) had UM while seven patients (7 eyes) had intraocular metastases. Patients with UM were followed for a median of 19.74 ± 10.4 months. Visual acuity (VA) logMAR 0.30 ± 0.53 (Snellen 20/40) versus 0.40 ± 0.97 (Snellen 20/50), tumor thickness (5.30 ± 2.17 vs. 3.60 ± 2.32 mm), were not significantly different between preoperative and postoperative measurements, respectively. Nine percent (1/11) patients required enucleation. Subsequently, no patients experienced metastases. Patients with intraocular metastases were followed for a median of 6.03 ± 6.32 months. They did not have significant changes in VA (logMAR 0.30 ± 0.59 vs. 0.30 ± 1.57; Snellen 20/40 vs. 20/40) or tumor thickness (3.50 ± 1.36 vs. 1.30 ± 0.76 mm) postoperatively. Fourteen percent (1/7 patients) required enucleation. Complications experienced by patients with UM include radiation retinopathy (2/11), papillopathy (1/11), cystoid macular edema (1/11), vitreomacular traction (1/11), exudative retinal detachment (1/11). Patients with metastases had treatment complicated by recurrence (2/7). Dose to the margin, maximum dose of radiation, and clinical target volume did not correlate with post-procedural VA, risk of enucleation, or death in patients with either UM or patients with intraocular metastases.
