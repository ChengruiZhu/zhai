Cardiovascular disease has become the main factor of death and birth defects in the world and also in Iran. New clinical studies have shown that early diagnosis of patients with coronary artery disease (CAD) can contribute to effective prevention or therapeutic structures, which reduce mortality or the next chance of cardiovascular events, and increase the quality of life. Most studies on CAD disease and its genetic risk factors so far, have been done excluding the Iranian population. PubMed was used to search for all relevant studies published on or before 2013 and rs3184504 was selected for association study for CAD. A total of 200 subjects with 100 cases and 100 controls were ultimately included in the analysis. Blood samples were collected and after DNA extraction the DNA analysis was performed by TaqMan Probe Real Time PCR to evaluate the association between candidate variant with the disease and some blood biochemical factors. Our study demonstrated that there was not a direct association between rs3184504 C>T variant with risk of CAD in Iranian population, whereas, there is a significant association between this variant with increased blood LDL and diastolic blood pressure. Further molecular analysis and other disease association studies are necessary in the Iranian population.
