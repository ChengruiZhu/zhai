Malignant mesothelioma originates from mesothelial cells and is a cancer type that aggressively invades into the surrounding tissue, has poor prognosis and no effective treatment. Gremlin-1 is a cysteine knot protein that functions by inhibiting BMP-pathway activity during development. BMP-independent functions have also been described for gremlin-1. We have previously shown high gremlin-1 expression in mesothelioma tumor tissue. Here, we investigated the functions of gremlin-1 in mesothelioma cell migration and invasive growth. Gremlin-1 promoted mesothelioma cell sprouting and invasion into three dimensional collagen and Matrigel matrices. The expression level of gremlin-1 was linked to changes in the expression of SNAI2, integrins, matrix metalloproteinases (MMP) and TGF-β family signaling - all previously associated with a mesenchymal invasive phenotype. Small molecule inhibitors of MMPs completely blocked mesothelioma cell invasive growth. In addition, inhibitors of TGF-β receptors significantly reduced invasive growth. This was associated with reduced expression of MMP2 but not SNAI2, indicating that gremlin-1 has both TGF-β pathway dependent and independent mechanisms of action. Results of
