Mass spectrometry-based proteomics methodology has become an important tool in elucidating some of the underlying mechanisms involved in cardiovascular disease. The present review provides details on selected important protein targets where highly selective and specific mass spectrometry-based approaches have led to important new findings and provided new mechanistic information. The role of six proteins involved in the etiology of cardiovascular disease (acetylated platelet cyclooxygenase-1, serum apolipoprotein A1, apolipoprotein C-III, serum C-reactive protein, serum high mobility group box-1 protein, insulin-like growth factor I) and their quantification has been discussed. There are an increasing number of examples where highly selective mass spectrometry-based quantification has provided new important data that could not be obtained with less labor intensive and cheaper immunoassay-based procedures. It is anticipated that these findings will lead to significant advances in a number of important issues related to the role of specific proteins in cardiovascular disease. The availability of a new generation of high-resolution high-sensitivity mass spectrometers will greatly facilitate these studies so that in the future it will be possible to analyze serum proteins of relevance to cardiovascular disease with levels of specificity and/or sensitivity that cannot be attained by immunoassay-based procedures.
