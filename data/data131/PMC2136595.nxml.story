/HA ratios were observed also in the allantoic membranes and fluids obtained from growth curve experiments in the intact chick embryo employing the various types of seeds. In correlating the liberated virus materials in the media of deembryonated eggs to those in the membranes it was noted that in any given 2 hour interval during the phase of nearly constant production and release up to 10 times the quantity of infectious virus was shed as was present in the tissues at the onset of that period. In contrast, only about ¼ of the hemagglutinins were released during the same time. The viral (V) and soluble (S) complement-fixing antigens were found in the tissues but no detectable quantities were released during any 2 hour interval. The NIHA in the membranes apparently is located within the cells since it could not be released by the action of RDE. Intracellular inhibitors of hemagglutination were readily inactivated following inoculation of undiluted ST, ΔST, or UP seeds but not when ultraviolet-inactivated virus was used. The inhibitor activity decreased in proportion to the hemagglutinins produced. Transfer of infected deembryonated eggs to the cold room after production and liberation of progeny were well under way immediately halted further release but in the tissues the
