Multiple lymphomatous polyposis (MLP) as an extranodal manifestation of mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) in the gastrointestinal tract is rare and not often reported in the literature. We describe the case of a 63-year-old female with asymptomatic MLP found during staging bidirectional endoscopy of MCL. The patient presented only with dyspnea, but was found on physical exam to have diffuse lymphadenopathy, and subsequent positron emission tomography (PET) CT showed extensive lymph node adenopathy consistent with lymphoma. Excisional lymph node biopsy revealed high-risk MCL. Prior to therapy, staging bidirectional endoscopy was performed, which revealed duodenal bulb polyps and diffuse polyposis in the colon. Biopsies showed atypical lymphoid infiltrate identical to the initial excisional lymph node biopsy. The patient underwent aggressive induction therapy, chemotherapy and bone marrow transplantation. Four months later, repeat colonoscopy and biopsies showed normal mucosa, and repeat PET CT showed no evidence of systemic disease. Eight months later, the patient began having symptoms consistent with cauda equina syndrome, and she was found to have leptomeningeal recurrence of MCL. In spite of other medical treatment, the patient's MCL progressed and she passed away 3 years after the initial presentation.
