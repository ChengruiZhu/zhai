Metastatic spread of breast carcinoma to the colon and rectum is rare. We report the case of a patient treated for lobular breast carcinoma presenting 17 years later with metastatic breast cancer of the colon. A 63-year-old lady with a past history of right-sided invasive lobular carcinoma of the breast presented with persistent diarrhoea. Colonoscopy with biopsies revealed a benign-looking stricture at the rectosigmoid junction. A CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis revealed a benign-looking stricture in keeping with a probable diverticular stricture. A Hartmann procedure was performed and histology revealed a metastatic lobular carcinoma with oestrogen and progesterone receptor-positive status. Treatment was commenced with letrozole and the patient remains well under clinical surveillance. In a patient with a history of breast carcinoma who presents with gastrointestinal symptoms the possibility of gastrointestinal tract spread should always be considered. Endoscopic diagnosis may be misleading with pathological diagnosis only being made following surgical resection. A history of breast carcinoma must be declared to the histopathologist following surgical resection so that an accurate diagnosis is made and appropriate treatment is commenced.
