The ability to survey hundreds of thousands of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) with cost-effective technologies is enabling investigators to conduct genome-wide association studies designed to find genetic variation affecting disease risk. To facilitate both interpretation of these studies and the design of follow-up studies, Nicolae and colleagues have made a comprehensive survey of the distribution and coverage of the first of these high-throughput platforms for genome-wide association mapping to be made publicly available, the Affymetrix GeneChip Human Mapping 100K set of SNPs (100K set). They found that SNPs within coding sequence are underrepresented in this mapping set relative to the set of SNPs included in the International HapMap Project, and this has consequences for the success of association studies. Measuring the information content confirms that the 100K set provides substantial coverage on variation in the HapMap database. The 100K set is quite redundant, as the SNPs were selected in the absence of information on the correlation (linkage disequilibrium) among them, and thus the relatively high value of the information content in the 100K set for the HapMap SNPs bodes well for general ability to survey genomic variation with a subset of variants.
