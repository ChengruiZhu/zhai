A battery of transcription factors collectively called the retinal determination (RD) network controls the earliest steps in the specification of the fruit fly compound eye. Loss-of-function mutations lead to the loss of the compound eyes while over-expression of RD network members in non-retinal tissues induces the formation of ectopic eyes. These observations suggest that the network governs the growth, specification, and patterning of the eye field. Recent studies have also shown that the RD network represses the fates of the non-ocular tissues that are also derived from the disc such as the antenna, maxillary palp, and head epidermis. One inconsistency in the model for how this network controls eye specification is that many of its members are expressed throughout the entire eye-antennal disc. In this study, we show that early in development, the RD network is expressed throughout and promotes the growth of the entire eye-antennal disc. After the initial growth phase, the expression of these genes is restricted to just the eye field. This temporal and spatial limiting of the RD network to the developing eye is essential so that its role can expand to include promoting eye specification and repressing non-ocular fates.
