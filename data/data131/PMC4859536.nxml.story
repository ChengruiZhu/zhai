White blood cells (leukocytes) are the effector cells of the immune system. The movement (extravasation) of leukocytes from the bloodstream to the surrounding tissue is a prerequisite for proper host defense. Platelets are anucleate cell particles that circulate in the blood and play a fundamental role in hemostasis. Here, we report a previously unrecognized function of platelets as "pathfinders" guiding leukocytes to their site of extravasation. Upon onset of the inflammatory response, platelets were found to immediately adhere to specific sites in the smallest venular microvessels. At these "hot spots", platelets capture intravascularly crawling neutrophils and, in turn, inflammatory monocytes. The cellular crosstalk arising from these interactions leads to conformational changes of distinct adhesion molecules on the surface of leukocytes, subsequently promoting the extravasation of these immune cells to the inflamed tissue. Conversely, blockade of this cellular partnership leads to misguided and inefficient leukocyte responses. Thus, platelet-directed guidance of leukocytes to confined sites of extravasation appears to be a critical step in the recruitment process of immune cells, which might emerge as a promising therapeutic target for the prevention and treatment of inflammatory pathologies.
