Assembly of the small and large ribosomal subunits requires two separate machineries. The assembly factor Rrp5 is unusual in being one of only three proteins required for assembly of both subunits. While it binds cotranscriptionally during early stages of small subunit assembly, it departs with large subunit intermediates after the separation of these precursors. How Rrp5 switches from interacting with small subunit precursors to binding large subunit precursors remains unknown but is potentially important, as it could regulate the interplay between small and large subunit assembly. Here, we show that the DEAD-box protein Rok1, a member of a ubiquitous class of RNA-dependent ATPases, releases Rrp5 from assembling small subunits to allow for its function in large subunit assembly. We show that a complex of Rrp5, Rok1, and adenosine triphosphate (ATP) binds small subunits or mimics of ribosomal RNA more tightly than does a complex of Rrp5, Rok1, and adenosine diphosphate (ADP). In cells, interconversion between the ATP and the ADP-form of Rok1 is required for release of Rrp5 from nascent small subunits and for binding to assembling large subunits. Furthermore, we show that the release of snR30, which leads to formation of a large substructure on small subunits, also requires Rok1-mediated release of Rrp5.
