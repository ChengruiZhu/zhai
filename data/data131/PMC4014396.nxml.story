A primary goal of the human visual system is to reconstruct the three-dimensional structure of the environment from two-dimensional retinal images. This process is under-determined: an infinite number of combinations of shape, material properties and illumination conditions could give rise to any single image. Rather than determining the true three-dimensional scene in a deductive manner, the visual system must make its ‘best guess’ based on the image, probabilistic models of image formation, and the stored probability of various scene configurations. For example, the visual system appears to assume that convex surfaces are more common than concave ones, biasing perception toward convex surfaces when the image is ambiguous. Here we identify a new probabilistic cue for surface shape: a shape with a visible specular highlight is more likely to be convex than one without. Highlights occur when light is reflected in a mirror-like way from glossy surfaces such as polished marble or metal. Due to the geometry of reflection, however, highlights are more likely to be occluded on concave objects. We show that the human visual system makes use of this constraint: shape perception is biased toward convex surfaces when highlights are apparent.
