We investigated the role of nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) and phosphatase and tensin homolog deleted in chromosome 10 (PTEN) in the pathogenesis of osteosarcoma and its relationship with prognosis. Immunohistochemical method was used to detect the expression of NF-κB and PTEN in osteosarcoma and adjacent tissues. RT-PCR was used to detect the expression of NF-κB and PTEN mRNA in osteosarcoma and adjacent tissues. Western blotting was used to detect the expression of NF-κB and PTEN in osteosarcoma and adjacent tissues and compare their differences. The expression of NF-κB and PTEN was detected in osteosarcoma and adjacent tissues. The positive rate of NF-κB was 75.3 and 32.9%, respectively; while the positive rate of PTEN was 67.1 and 90.4%, respectively. The positive expression of NF-κB and PTEN was statistically significant. There was a negative correlation between NF-κB and PTEN expression (r=−0.502, p<0.05). The positive and negative expression of NF-κB and PTEN was statistically significant for the five-year survival (p<0.05). At gene and protein level, osteosarcoma tissues had higher expression of NF-κB, and lower expression of PTEN, which was significantly different from the adjacent tissues. In osteosarcoma, NF-κB is highly expressed, but PTEN is expressed at low level, and the two are negatively correlated. This is of great significance for the early diagnosis of osteosarcoma and prognosis.
