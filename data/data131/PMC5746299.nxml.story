The understanding of adipose tissue development is crucial for the treatment of obesity-related diseases. Adipogenesis has been extensively investigated at the gene and protein levels in recent years. However, the alterations in protein glycosylation during this process remains unknown, particularly that of parthenogenetic embryonic stem cells (pESCs), a type of ESCs with low immunogenicity and no ethical concerns regarding their use. Protein glycosylation markedly affects cell growth and development, cell-to-cell communication, tumour growth and metastasis. In the present study, the adipogenic potentials of J1 ESCs and pESCs were first compared and the results demonstrated that pESCs had lower adipogenic potential compared with J1 ESCs. Lectin microarray was then used to screen the alteration of protein glycosylation during adipogenesis. The results revealed that protein modification of GlcNAc and α-1-2-fucosylation increased, whereas α-1-6-fucosylation, α-2-6-sialylation and α-1-6-mannosylation decreased in J1 ESCs and pESCs during this process. In addition, α-1-3-mannosylation decreased only in pESCs. Lectin histochemistry and quantitative polymerase chain reaction of glycosyltransferase confirmed the results obtained by lectin microarray. Therefore, protein glycosylation of ESCs was significantly altered during adipogenesis, indicating that protein glycosylation analysis is not only helpful for studying the mechanism of adipogenesis, but may also be used as a marker to monitor adipogenic development.
