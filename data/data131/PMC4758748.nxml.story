Cytokinesis is the process by which a cell divides in two and occurs once cells have replicated and segregated their chromosomes. Eukaryotic cells assemble a molecular machine called the actomyosin ring that drives cytokinesis. Contraction of the actomyosin ring is coupled to ingression of the plasma membrane and extracellular matrix remodelling. In eukaryotes, glycosyltransferases that synthesise polysaccharides of the extracellular matrix are emerging as essential factors during cytokinesis. Defects associated with the function of those glycosyltransferases induce the failure of cell division, which promotes the formation of genetically unstable tetraploid cells. Budding yeast cells contain a glycosyltransferase called Chs2 that makes a special layer of extracellular matrix and is essential during cell division. Our findings provide new insights into the molecular mechanism by which the cytokinesis regulators Inn1 and Cyk3 finely regulate the activity of glycosyltransferase Chs2 at the end of mitosis. In addition we isolated a group of actomyosin ring components that form complexes together with Chs2 and Inn1 at the cleavage site, which we have named ‘ingression progression complexes’. These complexes coordinate the contraction of the actomyosin ring, ingression of the plasma membrane and extracellular matrix remodelling in a precise manner. Chs2 is indeed a key factor for coordinating these events. It appears that similar principles could apply to other eukaryotic species, such as fission yeast even if the identity of the relevant glycosyltransferase has changed over the evolution. Taking into account the conservation of the basic cytokinetic mechanisms future studies should try to determine whether a glycosyltransferase similar to Chs2 plays a key role during cytokinesis in human cells.
