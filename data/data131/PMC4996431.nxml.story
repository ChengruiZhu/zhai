Disease may be due to either excess of undesirable cells, like in cancer or autoimmune disease, or by progressive loss of vital cells. The latter, for instance, causes neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimerâ€™s disease. Stem-cell based therapy holds great potential to cure devastating diseases with cell loss or dysfunctionality, because stem cells have the capacity to form any given cell type of the body. Recent advances in the field allow to obtain stem cells from virtually every patient. These stem cells could then be instructed to form the desired cells that can be reintroduced to cure the patient. Before such therapies are suited for the clinic, we first need comprehensive knowledge of the molecular mechanisms that underlie cell fate decisions. Here, we scrutinize the role of a junctional protein, called p120ctn, in both stem cells and lineage-committed cells. Importantly, this key protein has a modular structure, and each of its segments has different interaction partners and biological functions. We deleted p120ctn specifically in stem cells, and reintroduced several p120ctn mutants that lack specific protein segments. As such, we could unravel the exact molecular interaction that is required for p120ctn to drive the differentiation of stem cells towards primitive endoderm.
