We have measured the rate of heat production of isolated, quiescent, right ventricular trabeculae of the rat under isosmotic and hyperosmotic conditions, using a microcalorimetric technique. In parallel experiments, we measured force production and intracellular calcium concentration ([Ca2+]i). The rate of resting heat production under isosmotic conditions (mean +/- SEM, n = 32) was 100 +/- 7 mW (g dry wt)-1; it increased sigmoidally with osmolality, reaching a peak that was about four times the isosmotic value at about twice normal osmotic pressure. The hyperosmotic thermal response was: (a) abolished by anoxia, (b) attenuated by procaine, (c) insensitive to verapamil, ouabain, and external calcium concentration, and (d) absent in chemically skinned trabeculae bathed in low-Ca2+ "relaxing solution." Active force production was inhibited at all osmolalities above isosmotic. Passive (tonic) force increased to, at most, 15% of the peak active force developed under isosmotic conditions while [Ca2+]i increased, at most, 30% above its isosmotic value. We infer that hyperosmotic stimulation of resting cardiac heat production reflects, in large part, greatly increased activity of the sarcoplasmic reticular Ca2+ ATPase in the face of increased efflux via a procaine-inhibitable Ca(2+)-release channel.
