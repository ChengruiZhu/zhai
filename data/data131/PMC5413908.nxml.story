Mitochondria are pivotal organelles in eukaryotic cells. The complex proteome of mitochondria comprises proteins that are encoded by nuclear and mitochondrial genomes. The biogenesis of mitochondrial proteins requires their transport in an unfolded state with a high risk of misfolding. The mislocalization of mitochondrial proteins is deleterious to the cell. The electron transport chain in mitochondria is a source of reactive oxygen species that damage proteins. Mitochondrial dysfunction is linked to many pathological conditions and, together with the loss of cellular protein homeostasis (proteostasis), are hallmarks of ageing and ageing-related degeneration diseases. The pathogenesis of neurodegenerative disorders, such as Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease, has been associated with mitochondrial and proteostasis failure. Thus, mitochondrial proteins require sophisticated surveillance mechanisms. Although mitochondria form a proteasome-exclusive compartment, multiple lines of evidence indicate a crucial role for the cytosolic ubiquitinâ€“proteasome system (UPS) in the quality control of mitochondrial proteins. The proteasome affects mitochondrial proteins at stages of their biogenesis and maturity. The effects of the UPS go beyond the removal of damaged proteins and include the adjustment of mitochondrial proteome composition, the regulation of organelle dynamics and the protection of cellular homeostasis against mitochondrial failure. In turn, mitochondrial activity and mitochondrial dysfunction adjust the activity of the UPS, with implications at the cellular level.
