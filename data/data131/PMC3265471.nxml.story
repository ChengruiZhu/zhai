Eukaryotic cells can respond to extracellular signals by triggering the activation of specific genes. Viral infection of mammalian cells, for example, induces a high level of expression of type I interferons (IFNα and β), proteins required for antiviral immunity that protects cells from the infection. Previous studies have shown that the expression of the IFNβ gene is stochastic, and under optimal conditions only a fraction of the infected cells express the IFNβ gene. At present neither the mechanisms nor functions of this interesting phenomenon are well understood. We have addressed this question by analyzing IFN-expressing and non-expressing mouse cells that were infected with the highly transmissible Sendai virus. We show that stochastic IFNβ gene expression is a consequence of cell-to-cell differences in limiting levels and/or activities of virus components at every level of the virus induction process, from viral replication to expression. These differences include the sensing of viral RNA by host factors, the activation of the signaling pathway, and the levels of activated transcription factors. Our findings reveal the complexity of the regulatory mechanisms controlling stochastic IFNβ gene expression. We propose that the stochastic expression of IFN allows for an even distribution of IFN, thus avoiding over-expression of IFN in infected cells.
