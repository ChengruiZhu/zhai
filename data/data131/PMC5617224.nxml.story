Every human being is unique, each with an individual risk of developing disease. Variation between humans can be attributed to genetic variation or the environment to which we are exposed. However, phenotypic differences can also be due to the epigenetic pattern of our genes, which refers to chemical modification that affects the activity of our genes. Epigenetic factors have recently gained a lot of interest, and aberrant epigenetic patterns, have been linked to many diseases. In the present study, we have identified genetic and epigenetic factors that influence the activity of our genes, by way of comparing to the level of different proteins that our genes encode, proteins that have previously been associated with human diseases such as cardiovascular diseases or cancer. We could clearly see that the epigenetic pattern was associated with the expression of specific genes but that such associations were mainly caused by genetic variants, or environmental factors influencing both epigenetic and expression patterns. However, it appeared that some disease-associated proteins could have altering effects on the epigenetic pattern, then suggesting that some epigenetic alterations represent secondary effects to the pathogenesis of disease.
