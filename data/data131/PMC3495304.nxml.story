Dual-color fluorescence cross-correlation spectroscopy (dcFCCS) allows one to quantitatively assess the interactions of mobile molecules labeled with distinct fluorophores. The technique is widely applied to both reconstituted and live-cell biological systems. A major drawback of dcFCCS is the risk of an artifactual false-positive or overestimated cross-correlation amplitude arising from spectral cross-talk. Cross-talk can be reduced or prevented by fast alternating excitation, but the technology is not easily implemented in standard commercial setups. An experimental strategy is devised that does not require specialized hardware and software for recognizing and correcting for cross-talk in standard dcFCCS. The dependence of the cross-talk on particle concentrations and brightnesses is quantitatively confirmed. Moreover, it is straightforward to quantitatively correct for cross-talk using quickly accessible parameters, that is, the measured (apparent) fluorescence count rates and correlation amplitudes. Only the bleed-through ratio needs to be determined in a calibration measurement. Finally, the limitations of cross-talk correction and its influence on experimental error are explored.
