. The pyloric rhythm is important for the animal's feeding behavior, and previous work has shown that relative timing, or phase, of the neurons in the pyloric circuit is temperature invariant over a range of physiologically realistic temperatures (7 to 23Â°C), although the frequency of the rhythm increases. At higher temperatures, the rhythm often becomes disorganized or stops. In this paper we present experimental work on the isolated pacemaker of the pyloric rhythm together with a computational model that explores the loss of stability of the pacemaker as a function of temperature. Experimentally, we found that the isolated pacemaker responds to temperature similarly to the intact network, and maintains constant duty cycle over large temperature ranges. At high temperatures, about half of the pacemakers stop oscillating, reminiscent of certain mathematical bifurcations. We varied the temperature dependence and conductance densities of a simple model oscillator, and characterized its bifurcations as a function of temperature. We found that particular temperature-dependent relationships must be maintained to provide robust temperature performance of oscillators with variable underlying conductances.
