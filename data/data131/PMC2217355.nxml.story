The transmembrane domains of HERG (S1â€“S3) contain six negative charges: three are conserved in all voltage-gated K channels (D456 and D466 in S2, D501 in S3) and three are unique to the EAG family (D411 in S1, D460 in S2, and D509 in S3). We infer the functional role of these aspartates by studying how substituting them with cysteine, one at a time, affects the channel function. D456C is not functional, suggesting that this negative charge may play a critical role in channel protein folding during biogenesis, as has been shown for its counterpart in the Shaker channel. Data from the other five functional mutants suggest that D411 can stabilize the HERG channel in the closed state, while D460 and D509 have the opposite effect. D466 and D501 both may contribute to voltage-sensing during the activation process. On the other hand, all five aspartates work in a concerted fashion in contributing to the slow deactivation process of the HERG channel. Accessibility tests of the introduced thiol groups to extracellular MTS reagents indicate that water-filled crevices penetrate deep into the HERG protein core, reaching the cytoplasmic halves of S1 and S2. At these deep locations, accessibility of 411C and 466C to the extracellular aqueous phase is voltage dependent, suggesting that conformational changes occur in S1 and S2 or the surrounding crevices during gating.
