An 11-year-old obese male was involved in an all-terrain vehicle rollover accident. He had elevated transaminase levels along with a lactic acidosis.
The imaging studies did not reveal any major intra-abdominal or thoracic injuries.
The physical exam was unremarkable. The patient had an unremarkable PICU course and was transferred to the floor the next day. Within 24 hours of his transfer, he was noted to have interval worsening in liver function tests. He developed fulminant liver failure (FLF), renal failure, and encephalopathy. An ultrasound of the liver revealed increased echogenicity in the right lobe with focal sparing. Patient was listed for transplant. Investigations into any underlying medical cause of FLF were negative. Liver failure was presumed to be related to ischemia/reperfusion injury of the liver. The renal failure was due to rhabdomyolysis and was supported with renal replacement therapy. Patient received supportive care for FLF and was noted to have significant recovery of liver and renal function with time. He was discharged home after a 3-week hospitalization. 
Patients with crush abdominal injuries and elevated transaminase levels without evidence of parenchymal liver disruption may need to be closely monitored for liver failure related to ischemia reperfusion.
