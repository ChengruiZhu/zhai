The problem of obtaining the full genomic sequence of an organism has been solved either via a global brute-force approach (called whole-genome shotgun) or by a divide-and-conquer strategy (called clone-by-clone). Both approaches have advantages and disadvantages in terms of cost, manual labor, and the ability to deal with sequencing errors and highly repetitive regions of the genome. With the advent of second-generation sequencing instruments, the whole-genome shotgun approach has been the preferred choice. The clone-by-clone strategy is, however, still very relevant for large complex genomes. In fact, several research groups and international consortia have produced clone libraries and physical maps for many economically or ecologically important organisms and now are in a position to proceed with sequencing. In this manuscript, we demonstrate the feasibility of this approach on the gene-space of a large, very repetitive plant genome. The novelty of our approach is that, in order to take advantage of the throughput of the current generation of sequencing instruments, we pool hundreds of clones using a special type of “smart” pooling design that allows one to establish with high accuracy the source clone from the sequenced reads in a pool. Extensive simulations and experimental results support our claims.
