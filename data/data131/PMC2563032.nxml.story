Eukaryotic DNA is packaged into chromatin through its association with histone proteins. The linker histone H1 sits at the base of the nucleosome near the DNA entry and exit sites to stabilize two full turns of DNA. In particular, histone H1 participates in nucleosome spacing and formation of the higher-order chromatin structure. In addition, H1 seems to be actively involved in the regulation of gene expression. Histone H1 in mammals is a family of closely related, single-gene encoded proteins, including five somatic subtypes (from H1.1 to H1.5) and a terminally differentiated expressed isoform (H1.0). It is not well known whether the different variants have distinct roles or if they regulate specific promoters. We have explored this by inducible knock-down of each of the H1 variants in breast cancer cells. A different subset of genes is altered in each H1 knock-down, and depletion has different effects on cell survival. Interestingly, H1.2 and H1.4 depletion specifically caused arrest of cell proliferation. Concomitant with this, H1.2 depletion caused decreased global nucleosome spacing and repressed expression of a number of cell cycle genes. Thus, specific phenotypes are observed in breast cancer cells depleted of individual histone H1 variants.
