Genomic alterations in tumors affect the fitness of tumor cells, controlling how well they replicate and survive compared to other cells. The landscape of tumor fitness is shaped by epistasis. Epistasis occurs when the contribution of gene alterations to the total fitness is non-linear. The type of epistatic genetic interactions with great potential for cancer therapy is synthetic lethality. Inhibitors targeting synthetic lethal partners of genes mutated in tumors can selectively kill tumor and not normal cells. Therapy based on synthetic lethality is, however, context dependent, and it is crucial to identify its biomarkers. Unfortunately, the space of possible interactions and their biomarkers is overwhelming for experimental validation. Computational pre-selection methods are required to limit the experimental effort. Here, we introduce a statistical approach called SurvLRT, for the identification of epistatic gene pairs and triplets based on patient genomic and survival data. First, we show that using SurvLRT, we can deliver synthetic lethal interactions of pairs of genes that are specific to cancer. Second, we demonstrate the applicability of SurvLRT to identify biomarkers for synthetic lethality, such as mutational status of other genes that can alleviate the synthetic effect.
