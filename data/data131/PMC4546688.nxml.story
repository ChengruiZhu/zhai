Small proteins and peptides have important biomedical implications with their ability to penetrate cells, disrupt cell membranes, or form—potentially neurotoxic—fibrillar aggregates. It is rather intriguing that the same peptide can take part in all these processes depending on its environment. Hence it is important to understand how the environment guides the peptide from a disordered state to an alpha-helix or beta-sheet. By studying two different peptides with computer simulations, we find that one clue to this puzzle is the state of the allegedly disordered molecule in water, which is in fact characterized by a vast number of partially folded short-lived conformations. We investigate how interaction with macroscopic interfaces affects this multi-state conformational ensemble by promoting an alpha-helix over the other conformers. Furthermore, we show that association of two peptides can also be viewed as an interaction with an interface—a molecular interface. We show that the impact of macroscopic and molecular interfaces strongly depends on their ability to enforce partitioning of hydrophobic and hydrophilic residues. The effect gets more subtle as soon as macroscopic partitioning is coupled with peptide association where two interfaces compete: the relative balance of opposing forces determines aggregate stability and structure.
