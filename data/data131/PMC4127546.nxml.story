This article focuses on the symptomatic and diagnostic problems of primary duodenal adenocarcinoma (PDA) by way of two case reports and a literature review. An 85-year-old woman with an adenocarcinoma in the 1st duodenal portion was offered palliative care. A 90-year-old woman with an adenocarcinoma in the 3rd duodenal portion was also offered palliative care. A unique finding in the two cases reported herein is that PDA did not cause stenosis and occlusion of the lumen. As no reports of PDA without stenosis have been published so far, these cases may add to our knowledge of PDA. The diagnosis of PDA is often delayed because its symptoms may be absent until the tumor has progressed, thus leading to a delay of several months. Patients typically present with a long history of variable and vague symptoms, and many are diagnosed with advanced disease. As regards clinical manifestations, abdominal pain is the most frequent symptom. The majority of these tumors are found to have infiltrated the duodenal wall at presentation, with many being unresectable due to local and distal invasion. Esophagogastroduodenoscopy and gastrointestinal barium radiography are the main diagnostic tests for PDA, detecting 88.6 and 83.3% of tumors, respectively. In some cases, ultrasonography or computed tomography are useful for detecting PDA and determining vascular invasion.
