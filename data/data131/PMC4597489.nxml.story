Thirty-three of 45 (73%) athletes returned to sport for either all or part of the season after a median 5 days lost from competition (IQR=13)(Fig 1). Of the 33 athletes returning to in-season sport following an instability event, 63% (22/33) completed the season. Athletes with a subluxation were 5.3 times more likely (OR=5.32, 95%CI: 1.00, 28.07, p=0.049) to return to sport following an initial in-season shoulder instability event when compared to those with dislocations. Logistic regression analysis suggests that the WOSI (OR=1.05; 95% CI 1.00, 1.09; p=0.037) and SST (OR=1.03, 95% CI 1.00, 1.05; p=0.044) administered after the initial instability event are predictive of ability to return to play . For every 1 point higher the WOSI scaled score at the time of injury, the athlete was 5% more likely to return to play during the same season. Time loss from sport following a shoulder instability event was inversely correlated with the WOSI (p=0.039), SST (p=0.007), and ASES (p=0.02) scores at the time of initial injury. The SST demonstrated the strongest correlation with time lost from sport, and for every 10 points higher the SST scale score was at the time of injury an athlete returned to sport 1.2 (95%CI: 0.4, 1.9) days sooner (p=0.004). Based on the logistic regression analysis, time lost from sport is predicted using the SST score after the initial instability event (Table 1).
