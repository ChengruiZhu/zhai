The aim of the work was to evaluate the influence of the temperature of investment healting on the tensile strength and Vickers hardness of CP Ti and Ti-6Al-4V alloy casting. Were obtained for the tensile strength test dumbbell rods that were invested in the Rematitan Plus investment and casting in the Discovery machine cast. Thirty specimens were obtained, fiftten to the CP Titanium and fifteen to the Ti-6Al-4V alloy, five samples to each an of the three temperatures of investment: 430°C (control group), 480°C and 530°C. The tensile test was measured by means of a universal testing machine, MTS model 810, at a strain of 1.0 mm/min. After the tensile strenght test the specimens were secctioned, embedded and polished to hardness measurements, using a Vickers tester, Micromet 2100. The means values to tensile tests to the temperatures 430°C, 480 and 530: CP Ti (486.1 – 501.16 – 498.14 –mean 495.30 MPa) and Ti-6Al-4V alloy (961.33 – 958.26 – 1005.80 – mean 975.13 MPa) while for the Vickers hardness the values were (198.06, 197.85, 202.58 – mean 199.50) and (352.95, 339.36, 344.76 – mean 345.69), respectively. The values were submitted to Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) and Tukey
