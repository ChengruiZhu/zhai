The mean age of the patients was 14 years old (range 12-18). The mean Cobb angle was 56° (range 43° -88°) and the mean angle of vertebral rotation varied between 4-13.8°. The apical vertebra was between T7 and T11. The transverse pedicle width was significantly smaller (p < 0.05) on the concave side in the apical region of the thoracic spine (T7 and T8), measuring between 2.1-2.2 mm on the concave side and 2.7-3.1 mm on the convex side. Meanwhile, in some upper thoracic vertebrae (T3, T4, T5), the width was significantly bigger (p < 0.05) on the concave side than on the convex side, measuring between 2.8-4 mm on the concave side and 1.8-2.4 mm on the convex side. In the lumbar spine, the width varied between 4.1-9.9 mm without significant differences between the concave and convex sides (p > 0.05). The pedicle length varied between 15.4-28.7 mm and was significantly smaller (p < 0.05) on the concave side at T4, T5 and L2. The chord length was shortest at T1, measuring 32.4 mm and increased gradually to 54.3 mm at L3 but no statistical difference was found between the concave and convex sides. The transverse pedicle angle varied between 11.8° and 35° and was significantly bigger on the concave side at T7 and on the convex side at L1 (p < 0.05).
