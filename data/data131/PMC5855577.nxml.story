 (MA) is a traditional medicine having antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activities. The present study investigated the anti-stress role of MA and fermented MA (FMA) extract in immobilized rats. We studied the lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced inflammation in RAW 264.7 cells and rats were immobilized for 2 h per day for 14 days using a restraining cage. MA (100 mg/kg) and FMA (100 mg/kg) were orally administered to rats 1 h prior to immobilization. Using high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) analysis, we determined the rosmarinic acid content of MA and FMA. The generation of malondialdehyde (MDA) and nitric oxide (NO) in RAW 246.7 cells were suppressed by both MA and FMA. In rats, MA and FMA notably improved the body weight, daily food intake, and duodenum histology. MDA and NO level were gradually decreased by MA and FMA treatment. MA and FMA significantly controlled the stress-related hormones by decreasing corticosterone and Î²-endorphin and increasing serotonin level. Moreover, protein expression levels of mitogen activated protein kinases (MAPK) and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) were markedly downregulated by MA and FMA. Taken together, MA and FMA could ameliorate immobilized-stress by reducing oxidative stress, regulating stress-related hormones, and MAPK/COX-2 signaling pathways in rats. Particularly, FMA has shown greater anti-stress activities than MA.
