Different cells can make different amounts of biomolecules such as RNA transcripts of genes. New technologies are emerging to measure the transcript level of many genes in single cells. However, accurate quantification of the biological variation from cell to cell can be challenging due to the low transcript level of many genes and the presence of substantial measurement noise. Here we present a flexible, novel computational approach to quantify biological cell-to-cell variation that can use different types of data, namely measurements directly obtained from single cells, and/or those from random pools of k-cells (e.g., k = 10). Assessment of these different inputs using simulated and real data revealed that each data type can offer advantages under different scenarios, but combining both single- and k-cell measurements tend to offer the best of both. Application of our approach to single- and k-cell data obtained from resting and inflammatory macrophages, an important type of immune cells implicated in diverse diseases, revealed interesting changes in cell-to-cell variation in transcript levels upon inflammatory stimulation, thus suggesting that inflammation can shape not only the average expression level of a gene but also the geneâ€™s degree of expression variation among single cells.
