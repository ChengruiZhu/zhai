Osteoarthritis (OA), an inflammatory form of arthritis, is characterized by synovial inflammation and cartilage destruction largely influenced by two key proinflammatory cytokines—interleukin-6 (IL-6) and tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α). Notably, levels of visfatin (a proinflammatory adipokine) are elevated in patients with OA, although the relationship of visfatin to IL-6 and TNF-α expression in OA pathogenesis has been unclear. In this study, visfatin enhanced the expression of IL-6 and TNF-α in human OA synovial fibroblasts (OASFs) in a concentration-dependent manner and stimulation of OASFs with visfatin promoted phosphorylation of extracellular-signal-regulated kinase (ERK), p38, and c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), while ERK, p38, and JNK inhibitors or siRNAs all abolished visfatin-induced increases in IL-6 and TNF-α production. Moreover, transfection with miR-199a-5p mimics reversed visfatin-induced increases in IL-6 and TNF-α production. Furthermore, we also found that visfatin-promoted IL-6 and TNF-α production is mediated via the inhibition of miR-199a-5p expression through the ERK, p38, and JNK signaling pathways. Visfatin may therefore be an appropriate target for drug intervention in OA treatment.
