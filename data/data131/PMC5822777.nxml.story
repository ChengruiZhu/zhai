Nucleic acid oxidation plays an important role in the pathophysiology progress of a variety of diseases. 8-oxo-7,8-dihydro-2â€²-deoxyguanosine (8-oxo-dGsn) and 8-oxo-7,8-dihydroguanosine (8-oxo-Gsn), which originate from DNA and RNA oxidation, were the most widely used indicators for oxidative stress. The study investigated the relation between 8-oxo-dGsn, 8-oxo-Gsn, and CKD. 146 patients with CKD were divided into five disease stages, and their fasting blood and morning urine were collected. The levels of 8-oxo-dGsn and 8-oxo-Gsn in plasma and urine were quantified by LC-MS/MS. The ratio of urinary 8-oxo-Gsn to creatinine increased from stages 1 to 4 corresponding to the increased severity of CKD, but it decreased in stage 5. And plasma 8-oxo-Gsn gradually increased with the decline of renal function. In particular, the increased ratio of plasma and urine 8-oxo-Gsn in stage 5 exceeded the concentration of creatinine. This trend was similar to the estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), which indicates that 8-oxo-Gsn could be an appropriate indicator for renal function. Our finding indicates that as the disease progresses, RNA oxidation is increased. The significant increase in the ratio of plasma and urinary 8-oxo-Gsn is a novel evaluation index of end-stage renal disease.
