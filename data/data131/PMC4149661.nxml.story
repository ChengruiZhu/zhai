The advent of triple drug highly active antiretroviral therapy in 1996 was a turning point in the battle to control HIV disease. For the first time, HIV replication could be effectively limited resulting in marked improvements in morbidity and mortality from HIV infection. However, the treatment regimens were complex with patients having to take many pills at different times during the day, and the regimens were associated with significant long term side effects. Subsequent treatment strategies have focused on simplification of dosing to facilitate adherence and better tolerated regimens. Various combination pills were developed beginning with Combivir (zidovudine/lamivudine) given twice daily and then Truvada (tenofovir DF/emtricitabine) given once daily in combination with a third or fourth drug. This led to the development of single tablet regimens (STR), a single pill that provided complete therapy for treatment of HIV infection. The first STR was Trizivir (zidovudine/lamivudine/abacavir) given twice daily, which was followed by the once daily STRs Atripla (tenofovir DF/emtricitabine/efavirenz), Complera (tenofovir DF/emtricitabine/rilpivirine), and Stribild (tenofovir DF, emtricitabine, cobicistat, elvitegravir), which are now the most commonly used medications for the initial treatment of HIV infection. New drugs are in development, including the tenofovir prodrug TAF (tenofovir alafenamide fumarate) and the integrase inhibitor dolutegravir, which may offer advantages in safety, efficacy, and simplicity of dosing, and could be included in future STRs.
