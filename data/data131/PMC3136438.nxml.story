Previous studies showed that phosphorylation of a subset of regulatory (R) subunits of the cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) occurred under conditions that down-regulate global PKA activity, including growth on non-fermentable carbon sources. However, the role of the phosphorylation sites has not been elucidated. Addition of glucose to cells growing on a non-fermentable carbon source causes a transient increase of cAMP and PKA activity, which drives cells into S phase. A second peak in cAMP was proposed to restrain mitosis if the daughter cell had not reached an appropriate size. We identified a role for PKA in restraining mitosis following DNA damage. Here we provide evidence of cross-talk between the DNA damage checkpoint and PKA by phosphorylation of the R subunit. The R subunit phosphorylation sites and cAMP are necessary for the role of PKA following DNA damage. We propose that activation of PKA in response to DNA damage occurs in two steps: the phosphorylation of a subset of R subunits, probably to allow localized activation of these complexes, and cAMP to activate PKA. Our work suggests that the checkpoint and nutrient-sensing pathways share a signaling node to restrain mitosis following nutrient-induced rapid transition through the cell cycle and DNA damage.
