A comparative biomechanical analysis of 4 fresh-frozen human cadaver hemi-pelvises was performed. Prior to testing, all specimens underwent a CT scan and were deemed non-dysplastic based on center edge angle measurements. For each specimen, the acetabulum and proximal femur were potted in dental cement and mounted on a materials testing system (MTS Insight 5, Eden Prairie, MN). After resecting the labrum, a contact pressure and area mapping system (Tekscan, Boston MA) was placed within the acetabulum and a 700 N load was subsequently applied resulting in a real-time pressure map. Each specimen was sequentially tested in the intact state as well as anterosuperior acetabular rim-trimming (from the 12 o’clock to 3 o’clock position) of 2mm, 4mm, 6mm and 8mm depth. Each testing condition was examined at two different positions within the natural hip range of motion: 20° extension and 60° flexion. Analysis of total force, contact area, contact pressure and peak force was performed on two regions of interest: the acetabular rim and the acetabular base (deep part of acetabulum). The rim-trimmed states were then normalized with respect to the intact state in order to help account for specimen variability. Statistical analysis was conducted via a Paired and Unpaired Student’s T-test on normalized data.
