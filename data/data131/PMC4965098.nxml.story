Recovering gene co-expression networks from high-throughput experiments to measure gene expression levels is essential for understanding the genetic regulation of complex traits. It is often assumed for simplicity that gene co-expression networks are static across different contextsâ€”e.g., drug exposure, genotype, tissue, age, and sex. The biological reality is that, along with differences in gene expression levels, there are differences in gene interactions across contexts. In this work, we describe a model for Bayesian biclustering, or recovering non-disjoint clusters of co-expressed genes in subsets of samples using gene expression level data. Using results from our biclustering model, we build gene co-expression networks jointly across all genes by computing the full regularized covariance matrix between all pairs of genes instead of testing each possible edge separately. Because biclustering recovers structure in subsets of the samples, we are able to recover gene co-expression networks that occur across all samples, that are differential across contexts (e.g., up-regulated in males and down-regulated in females), and that are unique to a context (e.g., only co-expressed in lung tissue). We illustrate the robustness of our approach and biologically validate the networks recovered from three different gene expression data sets.
