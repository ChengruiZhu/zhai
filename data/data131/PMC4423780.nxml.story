Many blind patients have lost the light-sensing photoreceptor cells in their retinas, while deeper retinal cell layers, which normally cannot sense light, remain relatively intact. Promising new “optogenetic” therapies under preclinical evaluation use a modified virus to introduce light-sensitive proteins into surviving retinal cells, turning them into “replacement photoreceptors” and thereby restoring vision. However, several factors limit the feasibility of a clinical optogenetic therapy. For example, current light-sensing proteins only respond to unnaturally high light intensities and employ foreign signaling mechanisms to activate the target retinal cells. To overcome these limitations, we have engineered a cell-tailored light-sensing protein called Opto-mGluR6, which responds to daylight and activates a native signaling pathway within the target cells. Opto-mGluR6 is a chimeric protein composed of the light-sensing domains of the retinal photopigment melanopsin and the ON-bipolar cell–specific metabotropic glutamate receptor mGluR6, which amplifies the signal and ensures retinal responsiveness to daylight. We show that Opto-mGluR6 reliably recovers vision in the mouse, moving towards a clinical optogenetic therapy for patients suffering from photoreceptor degeneration.
