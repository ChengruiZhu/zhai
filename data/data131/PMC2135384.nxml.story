 By preliminary preparation of the skin in ways that render it hyperplastic the presence of infective virus can be demonstrated in extracts of domestic rabbit papillomas which yield no growths when inoculated by the ordinary methods and which for this reason have been supposed to contain no virus. The amount of virus recovered by the method outlined in the present work, however, is small when compared with the yield obtained in most instances from comparable cottontail rabbit papillomas. The yield is greatly influenced not only by the virus strain used to produce the growths but by the individual rabbit host. Although virus has been obtained from papillomas produced in domestic rabbits by all of the virus strains tested, a total of 21 thus far, only about one-fourth of these strains are readily to be procured again from the growths they cause and the others are demonstrable only in hosts in which the conditions are favorable for reasons unknown. An experimental comparison of the capacity of suspensions of papilloma tissue from domestic and cottontail rabbits to elicit specific antibodies has shown that the titers attained are approximately proportional to the amount of infective virus demonstrable in the suspensions. The findings as a whole indicate that far less virus exists in infective or antigenic form in the papillomas of domestic rabbits than in those of cottontail rabbits.
