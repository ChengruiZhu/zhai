Proteins are remarkable machines of the living systems that show diverse biochemical functions. Biochemical diversity has grown over time via molecular evolution. In order to understand how diversity arose, it is fundamental to understand how the earliest proteins evolved and served as templates for the present diverse proteome. The one sequence - one structure - one function paradigm is being extended to a new view: an ensemble of different conformations in equilibrium can evolve new function and the analysis of inherent structural dynamics is crucial to give a more complete understanding of protein evolution. Therefore, we aim to bring structural dynamics into protein evolution through our zipping and assembly method with FRODA. (ZAMF). We apply ZAMF to simultaneously obtain structures and structural dynamics of three ancestral sequences of steroid receptor proteins. By comparative dynamics analysis among the three ancestral steroid hormone receptors: (i) we show that changes in the structural dynamics indicates functional divergence and (ii) we identify all functionally critical and most of the permissive mutations necessary to evolve new function. Overall, all these findings suggest that conformational dynamics may play an important role where new functions evolve through novel molecular interactions.
