Deep tissue infection is a serious sequela that often demands intravenous (IV) antibiotic treatment. With respect to IV drug users (IDU’s), research and lived experience demonstrates a trend of failed treatment outcomes, most notably associated with leaving hospital against medical advice (LAMA) prior to treatment completion, increased adverse outcomes and patient hardship. This paper examines an alternative model for delivering and completing IV antibiotic treatment to IDU’s in a community care setting. A retrospective study was designed to review client characteristics. A total of 33 in-depth interviews were conducted with clients, clinicians and with staff. The impact of treatment adherence and completion, as well as client satisfaction of care was explored. A total of 165 patients were admitted during the study period. Osteomyelitis was the primary cause for IV antibiotics. Risk of leaving AMA was significantly lower for community model (p value <0.0000). Qualitative narrative analysis is also described with respect to satisfaction, stigma and the need for better models of care. With lower rates of LAMA a community model ought to be considered on a wider scale for provision of comprehensive support for populations with complex underlying health needs.
