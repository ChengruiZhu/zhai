Intervertebral disc degeneration (IVDD) is one of the key predisposing factors for low back pain. Although the exact mechanism remains unclear, inflammatory response and nucleus pulposus (NP) apoptosis are known to play important roles in this process. Prolactin protects against inflammation-associated chondrocyte apoptosis in arthritis. Based on prior studies, we hypothesized that prolactin might have therapeutic effects on IVDD by inhibiting the apoptosis of degenerative human disc NP cells. An experimental model of IVDD was established in 3-month-old Sprague-Dawley rats by submitting them to percutaneous disc puncture with a 20-gauge needle on levels 7–8 and 8–9 of the coccygeal vertebrae. Then the rats were injected with 20 or 200 ng prolactin on a weekly basis. Radiologic and histologic analyses were performed on days 4, 7, 14, and 28. The expression of prolactin and its receptor was analyzed in human tissue obtained from symptomatic patients undergoing microencoscopy discectomy, or from scoliosis patients undergoing deformity correction surgery. The results showed that intradiscal injection of prolactin maintained disc height and the mean signal intensity of the punctured disc. Histological analysis indicated that prolactin treatment significantly retained the complete structure of the NP and annulus fibrosus compared with the vehicle group. In addition, more collagen II, but fewer collagen I-containing tissues were detected in the prolactin treatment groups compared to the vehicle group. Moreover, low levels of tumor necrosis factor-α, interleukin-1β, cleaved-caspase 3, and TUNEL staining were observed in the prolactin treatment groups. We also demonstrated that prolactin impaired puncture-induced inflammation and cell apoptosis by downregulating activation of the NF-κB pathway. The degenerated NP tissues from patients had decreased expression of prolactin and its receptor, whereas expression was increased in the NP tissues removed from scoliosis patients. These results suggest that prolactin may be a novel therapeutic target for the treatment of IVDD.
