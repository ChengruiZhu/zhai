HD amino acid duplex can be found in the active center of different metallo-enzymes. An HD motif is positioned directly on the amyloid beta (AÎ²) fragment and on the carboxy-terminal region of the extracellular domain of the human amyloid precursor protein (APP) and a taxonomically well defined group of APP orthologues (APPOs). The conservation of the HD dyad is not position specific and it cannot be seen in a multiple alignment. Yet we show with a novel statistical method using evolutionary modeling that HD motif is positively selected by evolution on APPOs, despite the fact that HD dyad is underrepresented in the proteomes of all species of the animal kingdom. CAED of all APP orthologues and homologues are predicted to bind metal ions including Amyloid-like protein 1 (APLP1) and Amyloid-like protein 2 (APLP2). Our results suggest that HDs on the APPOs are most probably key components of metal-binding domains, which facilitate and/or regulate inter- or intra-molecular interactions in a metal ion-dependent or metal ion concentration-dependent manner. The involvement of naturally occurring mutations of HD (Tottori (D7N) and English (H6R)) in early onset Alzheimer's disease gives additional support to our finding that HD has an evolutionary preserved function on APPOs.
