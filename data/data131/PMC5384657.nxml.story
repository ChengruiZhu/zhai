The ability to predict whether an experience will end favorably is critical for well-being. Cues associated with specific outcomes can aid in prediction, enabling adaptive behaviors, but cue-outcome relationships are often difficult to learn or inherently ambiguous. Human studies have suggested that the hippocampus, a brain region involved in learning and memory, is also important for predicting outcomes and mediating behavior in situations of uncertainty and conflict. We tested the role of a subtype of hippocampal neurons born in adulthood in responding to ambiguously cued shock. We found that mice without these young neurons show less defensive behavior than normal mice when they hear an ambiguous cue, paired with shock in 50% of trials, but react normally when the cue perfectly predicts the shock. In a novel situation, normal mice behave defensively after ambiguously cued shocks but show very little anxiety-like (defensive) behavior if shocks were predictable. Mice without new neurons fail to make this adaptive change, showing moderate levels of anxiety-like behavior regardless of the predictability of earlier threats. Our findings suggest that an important role for the continued neurogenesis in the hippocampus is to enable adaptive changes to future behavior depending upon predictability of prior threats.
