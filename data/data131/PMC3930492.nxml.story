Given data about enzyme kinetics and reaction thermodynamics, traditional metabolic control analysis (MCA) can pinpoint the enzymes whose expression will have the largest effect on steady-state flux through the pathway. These analyses can aid experimentalists in tuning enzyme expression levels along a metabolic pathway. In this work, we offer a framework that is complementary to MCA. Rather than focusing on the relationship between enzyme levels and pathway flux, we examine a pathway's stoichiometry and thermodynamics and ask whether it is likely to support high flux in cellular conditions. Our framework calculates a single thermodynamically-derived metric (the MDF) for each pathway, which is convenient for selecting the promising pathways from a large collection. This approach has several advantages. First, enzyme kinetic properties are laborious to measure and differ between organisms and isozymes, but no kinetic data is required to calculate the MDF. Second, as our framework accounts for pH, ionic strength and allowed concentration ranges, it is simple to model the effect of these parameters on the MDF. Finally, as it can be difficult to control the exact expression level of enzymes within cells, the MDF helps identify alternative pathways that are less sensitive to the levels of their constituent enzymes.
