There are a number of factors that contribute to renal stone formation, including diet and obesity, specific drugs, other diseases, climate changes, metabolic disorders, and genetic predisposition. In this article, we focus on identifying genomic regions that may be involved with nephrolithiasis associated with a uric acid component. We analyze data from a genetic isolate in Sardinia to take advantage of the potential improvement in power to detect association with complex traits when related, homogeneous affected individuals are selected. To take into account the correlations among our related sample of cases and controls, we applied a recently proposed method that corrects for both known and unknown population and pedigree structure using genome-wide data. In simulation studies for outbred populations with related individuals and population structure, the method has been demonstrated to provide a substantial improvement over a number of existing methods in terms of power and type 1 error. We investigate the properties of this new method, as well as other association methods, in our inbred sample. To our knowledge, this is the first application of this recently proposed method to a founder population. This study is also the first genome-wide association study carried out for uric acid nephrolithiasis.
