. Remarkably,
legumain additionally exhibits ligase activity that prevails at pH
> 5.5. The atomic reaction mechanisms including their pH dependence
are only partly understood. Here we present a density functional theory
(DFT)-based quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics (QM/MM) study of
the detailed reaction mechanism of both activities for human legumain
in solution. Contrasting the situation in other papain-like proteases,
our calculations reveal that the active site Cys189 must be present
in the protonated state for a productive nucleophilic attack and simultaneous
rupture of the scissile peptide bond, consistent with the experimental
pH profile of legumain-catalyzed cleavages. The resulting thioester
intermediate (INT1) is converted by water attack on the thioester
into a second intermediate, a diol (INT2), which is released by proton
abstraction by Cys189. Surprisingly, we found that ligation is not
the exact reverse of the proteolysis but can proceed via two distinct
routes. Whereas the transpeptidation route involves aminolysis of
the thioester (INT1), at pH 6 a cysteine-independent, histidine-assisted
ligation route was found. Given legumainâ€™s important roles
in immunity, cancer, and neurodegenerative diseases, our findings
open up possibilities for targeted drug design in these fields.
