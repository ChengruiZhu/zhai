Gastric adenocarcinoma is a predominant disease with latent attribute, high malignancy, and poor prognosis in Peopleâ€™s Republic of China. Gastric cancer is the most common malignant tumor of the digestive tract. It has been suggested that abnormal expression of NEDD9 was associated with stage progression and metabolism of carcinomas. Some authors demonstrated that both messenger RNA (mRNA) and protein of NEDD9 were highly expressed in gastric cancer, and paired paracancerous atypical hyperplasia tissues were correlated with lymph node metastasis, tumor depth, and tumor-lymph node-metastasis (TNM) staging. In this study, we found that NEDD9 small interfering RNA (siRNA) can induce apoptosis and suppress proliferation, migration, and invasion of BGC823 cell lines. These findings suggested that NEDD9 siRNA might serve as a tumor suppressor by targeting NEDD9 in gastric cancer cell. It has been suggested that abnormal expression of NEDD9 was associated with carcinogenesis, and in the first part of the study, we found that NEDD9 was highly expressed in gastric cancer tissues; and it too was correlated with lymph node metastasis, tumor depth, and TNM staging. In this project, experiments were carried out to silence NEDD9 in BGC823 cell lines using NEDD9 siRNA, and the biological activity of BGC823 cells was observed after RNA interference.
