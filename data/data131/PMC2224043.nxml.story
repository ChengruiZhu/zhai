 1. Various amounts of β-glucuronidase activity may be found in all of the cutaneous appendages. 2. In the epidermis, the basal layer and the Malpighian layer contain a moderate amount of it, but a band of cells, including the stratum granulosum and the cells immediately above it, is rich in β-glucuronidase. 3. The cells of the duct of eccrine sweat glands have moderately strong enzyme activity, but those in the secretory coil are strongly reactive; small and large reactive granules are crowded in the reactive cytoplasm. 4. The cells of the secretory coil of the apocrine glands contain more β-glucuronidase than any other cutaneous appendage. 5. In the sebaceous glands, a very strong concentration of enzyme activity is found in the undifferentiated peripheral cells, a smaller amount of it is found in the differentiating cells. 6. In active hair follicles, the largest amount of β-glucuronidase is found in the outer root sheath and in the bulb. In the outer sheath, the strongest concentration is found around the level of the keratogenous zone of the cortex. The dermal papilla is strongly reactive. In quiescent hair follicles, the outer root sheath has a moderate amount of enzyme concentration, but the dermal papilla is unreactive. 7. In the dermis, the fibroblasts in the papillary layer, the smooth muscle cells of the arrectores pilorum and the tunica media of arteries, and the fat cells all exhibit enzyme activity. Mast cells show a great concentration of β-glucuronidase.
