 leaves, are known to have anticancer activity, but their mode of action is not well understood. Our aim in this study was to investigate the anti-migratory activity of seven GA against breast cancer cells and to determine the molecular mechanism behind this activity. All seven GA and their mixture inhibited wound healing in MCF-7 and MDA-MB 231 breast cancer cells. None of the compounds nor the mixture showed cytotoxicity towards the two cell lines, if tested by the resazurin assay. C13:0 inhibited NF-κB activity in the HEK Blue Null 1 reporter cell line. Furthermore, C13:0 inhibited degradation of nuclear factor of κ-light polypeptide gene enhancer in B-cells inhibitor α (IκBα). Sumoylation assay revealed that GA inhibited sumoylation of NF-κB essential modulator (NEMO). Molecular docking on SUMO-activating enzyme E1 showed that the seven GA bound to the active adenylation site with high calculated affinities ranging from -10.28 to -12.27 kcal/mol. Quantitative RT-PCR using C15:0, C13:0 and the mixture showed a significant down-regulation of urokinase plasminogen activator (uPA), plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1), C-X-C chemokine receptor type 4 (CXCR4) and matrix metalloproteinase 9 (MMP-9). We conclude that GA revealed considerable anti-migratory activity at non-cytotoxic concentrations, indicating anti-metastatic activity with low toxicity. This effect can be explained by the inhibition of NEMO sumoylation leading to inhibition of IκBα degradation and consequently a reduction of NF-κB activity, leading to the down-regulation of metastasis related genes including uPA, PAI-1, CXCR4, and MMP-9.
