Recent findings revealed in cancer cells novel stress response pathways, which in response to many chemotherapeutic drugs causing nucleolar stress, will function independently from tumor protein p53 (p53) and still lead to cell cycle arrest and/or apoptosis. Since it is known that most cancers lack functional p53, it is of great interest to explore these emerging molecular mechanisms. Here, we demonstrate that nucleolar stress induced by 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) in colon cancer cells devoid of p53 leads to the activation of ribosomal protein L3 (rpL3) as proapoptotic factor. rpL3, as ribosome-free form, is a negative regulator of cystathionine-Î²-synthase (CBS) expression at transcriptional level through a molecular mechanism involving Sp1. The rpL3-CBS association affects CBS stability and, in addition, can trigger CBS translocation into mitochondria. Consequently apoptosis will be induced through the mitochondrial apoptotic cell death pathway characterized by an increased ratio of Bax to Bcl-2, cytochrome c release and subsequent caspase activation. It is noteworthy that silencing of CBS is associated to a strong increase of 5-FU-mediated inhibition of cell migration and proliferation. These data reveal a novel mechanism to accomplish p53-independent apoptosis and suggest a potential therapeutic approach aimed at upregulating rpL3 for treating cancers lacking p53.
