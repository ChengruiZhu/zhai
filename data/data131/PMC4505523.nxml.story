 oocytes gave rise to a current that had a biphasic time course with initial and secondary slowly developing components. A second application of ATP evoked a response with a more rapid time to peak. This facilitation was reversed to initial levels following a 10-min agonist-free interval. A chimeric approach showed that replacement of the pre-TM1 amino-terminal region with the corresponding P2X2 receptor section (P2X7–2Nβ) gave responses that quickly reached a steady state and did not show facilitation. Subsequent point mutations of variant residues identified Asn-16 and Ser-23 as important contributors to the time course/facilitation. The P2X7 receptor is unique in having an intracellular carboxyl-terminal cysteine-rich region (Ccys). Deletion of this region removed the secondary slowly developing current, and, when expressed in HEK293 cells, ethidium bromide uptake was only ∼5% that of WT levels, indicating reduced large pore formation. Dye uptake was also reduced for the P2X7–2Nβ chimera. Surprisingly, combination of the chimera and the Ccys deletion (P2X7–2NβdelCcys) restored the current rise time and ethidium uptake to WT levels. These findings suggest that there is a coevolved interaction between the juxtatransmembrane amino and carboxyl termini in the regulation of P2X7 receptor gating.
