 by introducing a nucleus into cells that had been enucleated for 5 days. Golgi complexes were not detected in 5 day enucleates, nor were they observed in amebae fixed 15 min after renucleation. Samples taken at longer intervals after the introduction of a nucleus exhibited an increase in the size and abundance of Golgi complexes. Small curved smooth cisternae, some of which were aligned in parallel to form small Golgi complexes, were observed 30 min after the operation. Aggregations of small Golgi complexes increased in number in amebae fixed 1 to 6 hr after renucleation. Golgi complexes of normal size were present 6 hr after the operation and became more abundant in samples fixed 12 hr, and 1, 2, and 3 days after renucleation. The possible participation of the granular endoplasmic reticulum in the development of Golgi complexes was suggested by two observations. First, the Golgi complexes in renucleates contained a dense material similar to the content of the endoplasmic reticulum in enucleates and early renucleates. Second, examples of continuity between the endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi cisternae were present in renucleates. The possibility that Golgi complexes can be produced in the absence of preexisting Golgi complexes is discussed.
