Peritoneal carcinomatosis from gastric cancer represents a common recurrent gastric cancer that seriously affects the survival, prognosis, and quality of life of patients at its advanced stage. In recent years, complete cytoreduction surgery in combination with hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy has been demonstrated to improve the survival and prognosis of patients with malignant tumors including peritoneal carcinomatosis from gastric cancer. Establishing viable methods of accurately assessing the tumor burden in patients with peritoneal carcinoma and correctly selecting suitable patients in order to improve cytoreduction surgical outcomes and reduce the risk of postoperative complications has become a challenge in the field of peritoneal carcinoma research. Here, we investigated peritoneal carcinomatosis from gastric cancer in a mouse model by using our self-developed surgical navigation system that combines optical molecular imaging with an integrin-targeting Arg-Gly-Asp-indocyanine green (RGD-ICG) molecular probe. The results showed that our diagnostic method could achieve a sensitivity and specificity of up to 93.93% and 100%, respectively, with a diagnostic index (DI) of 193.93% and diagnostic accuracy rate of 93.93%.Furthermore, the minimum tumor diameter measured during the surgery was 1.8 mm and the operative time was shortened by 3.26-fold when compared with the conventionally-treated control group. Therefore, our surgical navigation system that combines optical molecular imaging with an RGD-ICG molecular probe, could improve the diagnostic accuracy rate for peritoneal carcinomatosis from gastric cancer, shorten the operative time, and improve the quality of the cytoreduction surgery for peritoneal carcinomatosis from gastric cancer, thus providing a solid foundation for its future clinical development and application.
