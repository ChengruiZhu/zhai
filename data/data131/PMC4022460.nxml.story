At least 5â€“10% of the human genome remains unassembled, unmapped, and poorly characterized. The reference assembly annotates these missing regions as multi-megabase heterochromatic gaps, found primarily near centromeres and on the short arms of the acrocentric chromosomes. This missing fraction of the genome consists predominantly of long arrays of near-identical tandem repeats called satellite DNA. Due to the repetitive nature of satellite DNA, sequence assembly algorithms cannot uniquely align overlapping sequence reads, and thus satellite-rich domains have been omitted from the reference assembly and from most genome-wide studies of variation and function. Existing methods for analyzing some satellite DNAs cannot be easily extended to a large portion of satellites whose repeat structures are complex and largely uncharacterized, such as Human Satellites 2 and 3 (HSat2,3). Here we characterize HSat2,3 using a novel approach that does not depend on having a well-defined repeat structure. By classifying genome-wide HSat2,3 sequences into subfamilies and localizing them to chromosomes, we have generated an initial HSat2,3 genomic reference, which serves as a critical foundation for future studies of variation and function in these regions. This approach should be generally applicable to other classes of satellite DNA, in both the human genome and other complex genomes.
