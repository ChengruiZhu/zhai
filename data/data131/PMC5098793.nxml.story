As sessile organisms, plants respond to and integrate environmental information. An intriguing aspect is how plants integrate this information. We studied the interactions among members of the phytochrome family of photoreceptors, which detect the changes in light quality that occur upon shading by other plants, as well as the duration of daylength, which indicates seasonal changes. We conducted these studies in Arabidopsis, which bears five phytochromes (phyA-phyE). We show that the individual roles of each phytochrome (in the absence of others) are different but, more importantly, that their combinations give different properties to the system. phyE, for instance, regulates flowering in a temperature-dependent manner, indicating that phyE signaling is a point of integration between light and temperature cues. phyC is poorly active on its own, but it is essential for the phytochrome-dependent photoperiodic flowering. In long-days (mimicking late spring) phyC promotes flowering indirectly, by inhibiting phyB and phyE signaling, which are themselves repressors of flowering. Conversely, under the short days of winter phyC becomes a flowering repressor because phyB requires phyC only for this specific response. Therefore, phyC is essential for the detection of photoperiod by phytochromes and suggest a conserved role for phyC in the photoperiodism of angiosperms.
