Genomes evolve mostly by modifications involving large pieces of genetic material (DNA). Exchanges of chromosome pieces between different organisms as well as intragenomic movements of DNA regions are the result of a process named homologous recombination. The central actor of this process, the RecA protein, is amazingly conserved from bacteria to human. In addition to its role in the generation of genetic variability, homologous recombination is also the guardian of genome integrity, as it acts to repair DNA damage. RecA-catalyzed DNA exchange (synapse) is facilitated by the action of presynaptic enzymes and completed by postsynaptic enzymes (resolvases). In addition, some enzymes counteract RecA. Here, the researchers assess the diversity of recombination proteins among 117 different bacterial species. They find that resolvases are nearly as ubiquitous and as well conserved at the sequence level as RecA. This suggests that the large majority of bacterial genomes are capable of homologous recombination. Presynaptic systems are less ubiquitous, and there is no obvious correlation between their presence and experimental data on the frequency of recombination. However, there is a significant pattern of co-occurrence between these systems and antirecombinant proteins.
