Mucosal histology plays a key role in the diagnosis, characterization and propagation of a host of gastrointestinal diseases, and the development of computational models capable of producing spatial architecture comparable to histology will enhance the evaluation of hypotheses for those diseases. Inflammation is a significant factor in the pathogenesis of a series of gastrointestinal diseases, and affects the maintenance of the mucosal architecture by morphogenic pathways. We have developed the Spatially Explicit General-purpose Model of Enteric Tissue (SEGMEnT) to investigate the behavior of enteric epithelial tissue as influenced by inflammation. SEGMEnT integrates cellular and molecular pathways governing morphogenesis and inflammation to generate a variety of pathophysiological processes from a common platform and knowledge base. Beyond reproducing healthy and disease ileal mucosal dynamics, SEGMEnT provides insight into a range of clinically relevant cellular-molecular mechanisms, including a novel putative role for Phosphotase and tensin homolog/phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PTEN/PI3K) as a key point of crosstalk between enteric inflammation and morphogenesis, the protective role of enterocyte sloughing in enteric ischemia-reperfusion and the mechanism of chronic low level inflammation as a driver for colonic metaplasia. These results suggest that SEGMEnT can serve as an integrating platform for the study of inflammation in gastrointestinal disease.
