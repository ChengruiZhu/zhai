p73 is a p53 family transcription factor. Due to the presence in the 5′ flanking region of two promoters, there are two N-terminal variants, TAp73, which retains a fully active transactivation domain (TA), and ΔNp73, in which the N terminus is truncated. In addition, extensive 3′ splicing gives rise to at least seven distinctive isoforms; TAp73-selective knockout highlights its role as a regulator of cell death, senescence and tumor suppressor. ΔNp73-selective knockout, on the other hand, highlights anti-apoptotic function of ΔNp73 and its involvement in DNA damage response. In this work, we investigated the expression pattern of murine p73 C-terminal isoforms. By using a RT-PCR approach, we were able to detect mRNAs of all the C-terminal isoforms described in humans. We characterized their in vivo expression profile in mouse organs and in different mouse developmental stages. Finally, we investigated p73 C-terminal expression profile following DNA damage, ex vivo after primary cultures treatment and in vivo after systemic administration of cytotoxic compounds. Overall, our study first elucidates spatio-temporal expression of mouse p73 isoforms and provides novel insights on their expression-switch under triggered conditions.
