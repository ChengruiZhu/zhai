 has published a series of important questions in cancer research and clinical oncology, which spark diverse thoughts, interesting communications, and potential collaborations among researchers all over the world. In this article, 8 more questions are presented as follows. Question 86. In which circumstances is good supportive care associated with a survival advantage in patients with cancer? Question 87. Can we develop animal models to mimic immunotherapy response of cancer patients? Question 88. What are the mechanisms underlying hepatitis B virus-associated non-hepatocellular cancers? Question 89. Can we more precisely target tumor metabolism by identifying individual patients who would benefit from the treatment? Question 90. What type of cranial irradiation-based prophylactic therapy combination can dramatically improve the survival of patients with extensive small-cell lung cancer? Question 91. How can postoperative radiotherapy prolong overall survival of the patients with resected pIIIA-N2 non-small cell lung cancer? Question 92. What are the key molecular events that drive oral leukoplakia or erythroplakia into oral cancer? Question 93. How could we track the chemotherapeutics-driven evolution of tumor genome in non-small cell lung cancer for more effective treatment?
