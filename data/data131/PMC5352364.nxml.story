, has been reported to exhibit anti-tumor activities in a variety of human malignancies including NSCLC (non-small cell lung cancer). TAZ (transcriptional co-activator with PDZ-binding motif), one of the key activators in Hippo pathway, has been characterized as an oncoprotein. Therefore, inhibition of TAZ could be useful for the treatment of human cancers. In the current study, we aimed to explore whether rottlerin inhibits the expression of TAZ in NSCLC, leading to its anti-cancer activity. Multiple approaches were applied for determining the mechanism of rottlerin-mediated anti-tumor function, including cell growth assay, Flow cytometry, wound healing assay, invasion assay, Western blotting, and transfection. We found that rottlerin inhibited cell growth, triggered apoptosis, arrested cell cycle, and retarded cell invasion in NSCLC cells. Moreover, our results showed that overexpression of TAZ enhanced cell growth, stimulated apoptosis, and promoted cell migration and invasion. Consistently, inhibition of TAZ exhibited anti-tumor activity in NSCLC cells. Notably, we validated that rottlerin exerted its tumor suppressive function via inactivation of TAZ in NSCLC cells. Taken together, our study indicates that inhibition of TAZ by rottlerin could be a promising strategy for the prevention and therapy of NSCLC.
