People who carry certain variants in their DNA are genetically predisposed to suffer from coronary heart disease (CHD) caused by abnormal tissue buildup (known as atherosclerosis) and blood clotting in the blood vessels of the heart. One of the DNA variants reported to increase CHD risk is named single nucleotide polymorphism rs4773144. It is still unclear as to why this DNA variant has an effect on CHD risk. In this study, by studying blood vessel cells from many people, we found that the DNA variant affects the production of two collagen genes and vascular cell survival. By examining atherosclerotic tissues from many patients, we discovered that the atherosclerotic tissues of patients who carry the rs4773144 variant are structurally more likely to break down and cause blood clotting which can lead to a heart attack. Furthermore, by studying a group of CHD patients, we noticed that those who carry the rs4773144 variant do have higher rates of heart attack. These findings are useful for understanding why this DNA variant has an impact on CHD risk and suggest that preserving adequate production of these two collagen genes may reduce the risk of heart attack in CHD patients, a potential strategy for development of therapeutics for the disease.
