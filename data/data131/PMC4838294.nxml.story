Reproduction in fishes and other vertebrates represents the timely coordination of many endocrine factors that culminate in the production of mature, viable gametes. Improving the ability to estimate reproductive performance in fish is important, due to the growth of the aquaculture industry and the need to maintain adequate broodstock and concerns over the effects of anthropogenic stressors on feral fish populations. We present here a quantitative, mathematical model of the female rainbow trout reproductive cycle. We show how the model is able to accurately describe experimentally measured data associated with pituitary, ovarian and liver reproductive performance. We also use the model to describe similar data sets collected in rainbow trout by other researchers. An important value of quantitative biological models is the ability to simulate various physiological conditions, real or hypothetical. We demonstrate this by predicting the effects of exposure to an endocrine disruptor on oocyte growth. The need to limit cost and animal usage will encourage future experimental studies to use in vitro methods. The model presented here can assist with the extrapolation of in vitro effects to the whole fish.
