We evaluated the use of droplet digital PCR (ddPCR) to detect plasma cell-free DNA (cfDNA) epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutations in advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients. Compared with tumor-tissue-based detection, the sensitivity of ddPCR for detecting plasma cfDNA tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI)-sensitizing EGFR mutations was 61.3%, the specificity was 96.7%, and the consistency rate was 81.4% (?=0.605, 95% confidence interval: 0.501-0.706, p <0.0001). The sensitivity declined from 82.6% to 46.7% with decreasing cfDNA inputs (p=0.028). The plasma cfDNA concentration correlated with gender (males vs.females =11.69 ng/mL vs. 9.508 ng/mL; p=0.044), EGFR mutation status (tumor-tissue EGFR mutation-positive (EGFR M+) vs. EGFR mutation-negative (EGFR M-) = 9.61 ng/mL vs. 12.82 ng/mL; p =0.049) and specimen collection time (=2 years vs. >2 years=13.83 ng/mL vs. 6.575 ng/mL; p <0.001), and was greater in tumor-tissue EGFR M+ / plasma EGFR M+ patients than in tumor-tissue EGFR M+/plasma EGFR M- patients (11.61 vs. 7.73 ng/mL, respectively; p=0.003). Thus total cfDNA input crucially influences the sensitivity of plasma cfDNA EGFR mutation testing with ddPCR. Such analysis could be an effective supplemental test for advanced NSCLC patients.
