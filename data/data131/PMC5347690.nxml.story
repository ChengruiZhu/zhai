Galectin-3 (Gal-3), an oncogenic pro-inflammatory protein, has been suggested as a possible complementary diagnostic candidate to prostate specific antigen (PSA) blood test for prostate cancer patients. The presence of the proteins in the circulation (biomarkers) may elicit an intrinsic humoral immune reaction by generating autoantibodies, which consequently could alter the detection levels. Here, we report the associations of the two prostate cancer biomarkers, Gal-3 and PSA in patients at different clinical states of prostate cancer while taking into account the autoantibody levels. A blind, prospective, single institution, pilot study was conducted. A total of 95 men were classified into 5 groups: healthy controls (Group1), newly diagnosed patients (Group2), no recurrence after local therapy (Group3), rising PSA after local therapy (Group4), and metastatic patients (Group5). Gal-3 and PSA level were divided by their respective autoantibodies, which yielded relative PSA and relative Gal-3 levels. After the adjustments, Spearman's rank correlations and linear regression modeling revealed the positive associations between relative Gal-3 and relative PSA levels among all 95 men combined (rho = 0.446,
