Organisms are usually exposed to changing environments and balance these perturbations by altering their metabolic state. Gaining a deeper understanding of metabolic adjustment to varying external conditions is important for the development of advanced engineering strategies for microorganisms as well as for higher plants. One tool which is particularly suited for investigating these processes is genome-scale metabolic models. These large-scale representations of the underlying metabolic networks enable the integration of experimental data and application of constrain-based mathematical approaches to estimate flux rates through the chemical reactions of the network under different environmental scenarios. However, for most of these approaches the assumption of a steady-state (flux balance) is indispensable and therefore precludes the prediction of metabolite concentrations. Here, we present a data-driven observation that relates results from a flux-centric constraint-based approach that is based on transcriptomics data to metabolite levels from the same experiments. Our observations suggest that constraint-based modeling approaches in combination with high-throughput data can be used to infer regulatory principles about the plasticity and robustness of metabolic behavior from the stoichiometry of the underlying reactions alone.
