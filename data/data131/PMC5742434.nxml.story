The selection of an anterior, lateral, or posterior approach to the cervicothoracic junction for surgical treatment of vertebral osteomyelitis is still a matter of debate. These ordinary approaches generally require an extensile exposure. This article describes a less invasive approach case of a vertebral osteomyelitis of T2/3 using a video-assisted operating technique of thoracic surgery (VATS). A 78-year-old female underwent anterior debridement and interbody fusion with bone graft at T2/3 using a lateral surgical approach through a right thoracotomy with VATS. The VATS through two small skin incisions in the axillary region provides a good view without requiring elevation of the scapula with extensile muscle dissection and rib resection. There was no complication without partial lobectomy due to pleural adhesion during the perioperative period. Currently, at 1 year after operation, the patient has no back pain with neurologically normal findings and no inflammation findings (CRP was 0.01â€‰mg/dl). Although the operating field of the upper thoracic level in the lateral approach is generally deep and narrow, the VATS provides a good view and allows us to perform adequate debridement and bone fusion at the T2/3 level with a less invasive approach than those previously described anterior or laterally or posterior approach.
