Mathematical models are used as pragmatic tools to inform policy makers on public health interventions and many non-health problems. Considerable efforts have been made to build realistic simulation models. Understanding the systems behavior and the effect of model assumptions and parameter values on the results before drawing conclusions for policy is crucial. Common and edge manifestations of complex model runs should be analyzed and therefore we present an active learning approach, also known as a sequential design of experiments, based on surrogate modeling and a model-guided experimentation process. First, we illustrate our approach with an individual-based model for influenza and demonstrate the benefits compared to current complex modeling practices. Second, we establish the power of our approach with a high dimensional model with correlated inputs to explore cost-effectiveness of varicella-zoster vaccination programs. The most influential variables are identified with the aim to reduce dimensionality and decrease decision uncertainty. We also elaborate on the use of surrogate models as an emulator to improve rapid policy making in various settings. To this purpose we provide an interactive platform through which the reader can explore instantaneously the sensitivity of the surrogate models to parameter changes for both our applications.
