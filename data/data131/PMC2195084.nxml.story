 A model cell which controls its cation composition and volume by the action of a K-Na exchange pump and leaks for both ions working in parallel is presented. Equations are formulated which describe the behavior of this model in terms of three membrane parameters. From these equations and the steady state concentrations of Na, K, and Cl, values for these parameters in high potassium (HK) and low potassium (LK) sheep red cells are calculated. Kinetic experiments designed to measure the membrane parameters directly in the two types of sheep red cells are also reported. The values of the parameters obtained in these experiments agreed well with those calculated from the steady state concentrations of ions and the theoretical equations. It is concluded that both HK and LK sheep red cells control their cation composition and volume in a manner consistent with the model cell. Both have a cation pump which exchanges one sodium ion from inside the cell with one potassium ion from outside the cell but the pump is working approximately four times faster in the HK cell. The characteristics of the cation leak in the two cell types are also very different since the HK cells are relatively more leaky to sodium as compared with potassium than is the case in the LK cells. Both cell types show appreciable sodium exchange diffusion but this process is more rapid in the LK than in the HK cells.
