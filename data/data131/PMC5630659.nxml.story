Human umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cells (hUC-MSCs) are potential stromal cells which are regarded as the most feasible stem cell group in cell therapy. The maintenance of cell survival without differentiation is important in cell transplantation and stem cell therapy. However, negative factors exist in cell transplantation. Lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) is a non-antigenic small molecule phospholipid which induced several fundamental cellular responses, such as cell proliferation, apoptosis and migration. In this study we aimed to explore the effects of LPA on the survival and differentiation of MSCs and its availability in cell therapy. We found that LPA stimulated hUC-MSC proliferation and protected hUC-MSCs from lipopolysaccharide (LPS) induced apoptosis. We also observed that CD29, CD44, CD73, CD90 and CD105 were expressed, whereas CD34 and CD45 were not expressed in hUC-MSCs, and these makers have no change in LPA containing medium, which indicated that LPA accelerated the survival of hUC-MSCs in an undifferentiating status. We also demonstrated that higher expressed LPAR1 involved in LPA stimulated cell survival action. LPA stimulated cell proliferation was associated with LPAR1 mediated G
