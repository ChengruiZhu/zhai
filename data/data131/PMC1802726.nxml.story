Vibrational microscopy and imaging offer several advantages for a variety of dermatological applications, ranging from studies of isolated single cells (corneocytes) to characterization of endogenous components in intact tissue. Two applications are described to illustrate the power of these techniques for skin research. First, the feasibility of tracking structural alterations in the components of individual corneocytes is demonstrated. Two solvents, DMSO and chloroform/methanol, commonly used in dermatological research, are shown to induce large reversible alterations (α-helix to β-sheet) in the secondary structure of keratin in isolated corneocytes. Second, factor analysis of image planes acquired with confocal Raman microscopy to a depth of 70 μm in intact pigskin, demonstrates the delineation of specific skin regions. Two particular components that are difficult to identify by other means were observed in the epidermis. One small region was formed from a conformationally ordered lipid phase containing cholesterol. In addition, the presence of nucleated cells in the tissue (most likely keratinocytes) was revealed by the spectral signatures of the phosphodiester and cytosine moieties of cellular DNA.
