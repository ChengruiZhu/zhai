These findings show no association between maternal and neonatal outcomes and the presence of consultants on the labor ward, with the exception of weak evidence for a reduced likelihood of severe perineal tears following out-of-hours delivery. However, women who deliver out-of-hours may be less likely to have an obstetric intervention than women who deliver in-hours, possibly because obstetric teams will usually try to undertake operative deliveries during in-hours shifts. The accuracy of these findings may be limited by the use of administrative records to determine when consultants were present on labor wards and by the potential for “bias by indication.” That is, obstetric teams may have tried to ensure that women with a greater risk of a poor outcome delivered in-hours rather than out-of-hours. Nevertheless, these findings suggest that the current organization of maternity care in the UK allows for good planning and risk management. Thus, although further robust evidence on the quality of care delivered at all times of the week by UK maternity units is needed, politically driven efforts to increase senior obstetrician attendance “out-of-hours” may not lead to improved clinical outcomes for women and babies.
