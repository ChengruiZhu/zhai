Postnatal catch-up growth may be related to reduce mitochondrial content and oxidation capacity in skeletal muscle. The aim of this study is to explore the effect and mechanism of antioxidant MitoQuinone mesylate beta cyclodextrin complex (MMCC) ameliorates catch-up growth related metabolic disorders. Catch-up growth mice were created by restricting maternal food intake during the last week of gestation and providing high fat diet after weaning. Low birthweight mice and normal birthweight controls were randomly subjected to normal fat diet, high fat diet and high fat diet with MMCC drinking from the 4th week. MMCC treatment for 21 weeks slowed down the catch up growth and ameliorated catch-up growth related obesity, glucose intolerance and insulin resistance. MMCC administration significantly inhibited the peroxidation of the membrane lipid and up-regulated the antioxidant enzymes Catalase and MnSOD. In addition, MMCC treatment effectively enhanced mitochondrial functions in skeletal muscle through the up-regulation of the ATP generation, and the promotion of mitochondrial replication and remodeling. To conclude, this study demonstrates that antioxidant MMCC effectively ameliorates catch-up growth related metabolic dysfunctions by increasing mitochondrial functions in skeletal muscle.
