Microelectrode and tracer flux studies of the Urechis egg during fertilization have shown: (a) insemination causes a fertilization potential; the membrane potential rises from an initial level of -33 +/- 6 mV to a peak at +51 +/- 6 mV (n = 16), falls to a plateau of about +30 mV, then returns to the original resting potential 9 +/- 1 min (n - 10) later; (b) the fertilization potential results from an increase in Na+ permeability, which is amplified during the first 15 s by a Ca++ action potential; (c) the maximum amplitude of the fertilization potential, excluding the first 15 s, changes by 51 mV for a 10-fold change in external [Na+]; (d) in the 10 min period after insemination, both Na+ and Ca++ influxes increase relative to unfertilized egg values by factors of 17 +/- 7 (n = 6) and 34 +/- 14 (n = 4), respectively; the absolute magnitude of the Na+ influx is 16 +/- 6 times larger than that of Ca++; (e) in the absence of sperm these same electrical and ionic events are elicited by trypsin; thus, the ion channels responsible must preexist in the unfertilized egg membrane; (f) increased Na+ influx under conditions of experimentally induced polyspermy indicates that during normal monospermic fertilization, only a fraction of available Na+ channels are opened; we conclude that these channels are sperm- gated; (g) Ca++ influx at fertilization is primarily via the membrane potential-gated channel, because kinetics are appropriate, and influx depends on potential in solutions of varying [Na+], but is independent of number of sperm incorporations in normal sea water.
