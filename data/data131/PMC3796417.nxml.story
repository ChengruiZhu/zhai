The present study aimed to compare the combined effect of tamoxifen (TAM) and doxorubicin (ADM) with the individual effects of TAM and ADM alone on the MG63 human osteosarcoma cell line. Estrogen receptor (ER) expression was detected in the MG63 cells using reverse transcription PCR. The morphological changes during the inhibition of cell growth were observed using an inverted microscope and a 3-(4, 5-dimethy1-2-thiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl-tetrazolium bromide (MTT) colorimetric assay following the individual or combined addition of TAM and ADM. ERα and ERβ expression was detected in the MG63 cells. The typical apoptotic cell morphology was observed in all groups, with the exception of the control group. The MTT colorimetric analysis demonstrated that the rate of inhibition of cell proliferation in the combination group was significantly increased compared with that in the other groups (P<0.05). ERα and ERβ expression was detected in the MG63 human osteosarcoma cells. TAM and ADM alone were able to inhibit cell proliferation. The combination of TAM and ADM significantly enhanced the inhibitory effect, partly through the enhanced sensitivity of the cells to ADM by TAM, which caused the inhibition of cell proliferation and apoptosis.
