 The mechanism of enzyme-inhibitor-substrate reactions has been analyzed from a theoretical standpoint and illustrated by data from the system cholinesterase-physostigmine-acetylcholine. This treatment is by no means limited to a single system but should be generally applicable to others of similar type. Competitive enzyme-inhibitor-substrate systems show the same characteristic "zones of behavior" already demonstrated for non-competitive systems by Straus and Goldstein. These zones, three in number, determine the mathematical function which relates activity of an enzyme to concentration of an added substrate or inhibitor or both. The effects of suboptimal substrate concentration in such systems have been considered, and the errors arising from various common simplifications of the descriptive equations have been pointed out. The zone behavior phenomenon has been shown to be useful in determining the number of molecules of substrate or inhibitor combining reversibly with a single enzyme center. The kinetics of competitive inhibition, dilution effect, combination of inhibitor or substrate with enzyme, and destruction of inhibitor or substrate by enzyme have been analyzed and experimentally verified, and absolute velocity constants have been determined. Theoretical conclusions have been discussed from the standpoint of their physiological significance.
