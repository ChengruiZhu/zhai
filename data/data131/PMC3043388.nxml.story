A prospective study was conducted from March 1999 to April 2000 that included 73 patients who underwent elective laparoscopic cholecystectomy for uncomplicated gallstone disease. The study was conducted at one surgical unit in the Department of Surgery and Department of Radio-diagnosis and one surgical unit in the Department of Surgery, Maulana Azad Medical College and the associated Lok Nayak Hospital, which is the largest referral hospital in northern India and is located in the capital of India. A preoperative ultrasound was performed just prior to surgery, and 4 ultrasonographic parameters were analyzed, namely gallbladder wall thickness, contracted gallbladder, impaction of gallstones at the neck of the gallbladder, and common bile duct stones. The surgical findings were objectively graded as difficult or easy laparoscopic cholecystectomy according to 5 operative parameters, namely total time taken for the surgery, time taken to dissect gallbladder bed, spillage of stones, tear of gallbladder during dissection, and conversion to the open procedure. Of the 73 cases, 17 (23.3%) were conversions to the open procedure. Of the 21 (28.76%) cases predicted to be difficult, 17 (23.3%) were technically difficult, of which 13 (17.8%) were converted to the open procedure. Of the 52 (71.23%) cases predicted to be easy on ultrasonography, only 7 (9.38%) were found to be difficult on surgery, of which only 4 (5.48%) had to be converted to the open procedure. Based on our results, we conclude that preoperative ultrasonography is of great value in selecting patients preoperatively for laparoscopic cholecystectomy and minimizing complications and conversion to the open procedure.
