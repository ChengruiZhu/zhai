Our genome is comprised of two compartments. The euchromatin harbors abundant genes and regulatory information, while heterochromatin harbors few genes and abundant repetitive DNA. These characteristic features of heterochromatin challenge traditional methods of sequence assembly and molecular dissection. The analysis, instead, of proteins that localize to and often functionally define heterochromatic sequence has illuminated numerous heterochromatin-dependent, essential cellular processes, including chromosome segregation, telomere stability, and gene regulation. With the aim of increasing our sample of heterochromatin-localizing proteins, we performed a comprehensive search for new members of Heterochromatin Protein 1 gene family over 40 million years of Drosophila evolution. Our report expands this family from a modest five genes to 26 genes. Unlike the founding family members, the HP1s we describe are structurally diverse, largely restricted to male reproductive tissue, and highly dynamic over evolutionary time. Despite recurrent HP1 gene birth and death, gene numbers per species are relatively constant. These gene “replacements” likely support a dynamic biological process. We propose, and present evidence for, the hypothesis that recurrent chromosomal rearrangements drive at least some HP1 gene family dynamics observed. We anticipate that these HP1 genes will help define new heterochromatin-dependent processes in the male germline.
