′ = 0.5 for (II). The whole mol­ecule of (II) is generated by inversion symmetry, the pyrazine ring being situated about a center of inversion. In (I), the four pyridine rings are inclined to the pyrazine ring by 83.9 (2), 82.16 (18), 82.73 (19) and 17.65 (19)°. This last dihedral angle involves a pyridine ring that is linked to the adjacent carboxamide O atom by an intra­molecular C—H⋯O hydrogen bond. In compound (II), the unique pyridine rings are inclined to the pyrazine ring by 33.3 (3) and 81.71 (10)°. There are two symmetrical intra­molecular C—H⋯O hydrogen bonds present in (II). In the crystal of (I), mol­ecules are linked by N—H⋯O and N—H⋯N hydrogen bonds, forming layers parallel to (10-1). The layers are linked by C—H⋯O and C—H⋯N hydrogen bonds, forming a three-dimensional framework. In the crystal of (II), mol­ecules are linked by N—H⋯N hydrogen bonds, forming chains propagating along the [010] direction. The chains are linked by a weaker N—H⋯N hydrogen bond, forming layers parallel to the (101) plane, which are in turn linked by C—H⋯O hydrogen bonds, forming a three-dimensional structure. In the crystal of compound (I), a region of disordered electron density was treated with the SQUEEZE routine in
