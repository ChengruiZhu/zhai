We reported the cases in order to evaluate the effects of individualized nutrition interventions for enhancing self-management abilities of prediabetic subjects. We conducted four nutrition interventions for weight control in two subjects with high-risk of type 2 diabetes. The first subject was a 53-year-old housewife, and the second subject was a 46-year-old male office worker. The subjects visited the medical center 4 times during the study period, and the lifestyle interventions were advised by a clinical team comprised physicians, clinical dietitians, and nurses. In particular, nutrition intervention to achieve weight loss focused on enhancing motivation and problem-solving skills to improve self-management ability. As a result, both subjects achieved weight loss by the time of their last visits. These two case studies, which differed in terms of sex, occupation, and dietary habits showed the importance of individualized nutrition intervention and forming an intimate relationship based on trust centered on prediabetic subjects. In conclusion, systematic collaboration within the clinical team is necessary, and social infrastructure should be prepared to fully realize the benefits of a systematic intervention program.
