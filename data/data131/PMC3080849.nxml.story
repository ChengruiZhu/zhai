Maltose-binding protein (MBP) is a bacterial protein involved in nutrient uptake. Crystallographic studies have revealed two stable conformations: a ligand-free open form and a liganded closed form. The interconversion between the 2 forms has been traditionally viewed as a ligand “induced” process. However, recent NMR experiments have suggested that the ligand-free protein is flexible enough to visit partially closed states. Because these states may display higher affinity for the ligand than the open state, ligand binding may proceed via a “conformational selection” of the most geometrically and chemically favored conformer. Mechanistic details of this process remain elusive as atomic structures of relevant intermediate conformations are currently lacking. In this study, we use atomistic simulations to characterize the flexibility of the MBP protein, and confirm the existence of a hidden semi-closed state. The relative stabilities of the two states is predicted and corroborated with existing experimental data. A key finding of the study is that the closed form of the protein – adopted by the ligand-bound form – is not observed in the simulations of the ligand-free protein. This has implications for understanding ligand binding mechanisms in MBP and related proteins.
