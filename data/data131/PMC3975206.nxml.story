A 77-year-old man with a history of surgical resection of malignant melanoma involving the fifth toe of his left foot 14 years ago presented at the Kariya Toyota General Hospital with a 3-month history of skin ulcer at the same site and red nodules on the lower left leg. Malignant melanoma was suspected, and the patient was referred to our department. On examination, a skin ulcer measuring 25 × 20 mm was observed at the amputation site on the left foot. In addition, multiple red nodules were observed on the lower left leg. Skin biopsies of the ulcer and nodules revealed recurrent malignant melanoma with in-transit metastasis. Two weeks later, he developed acute myocardial infarction and was hospitalized at the Kariya Toyota General Hospital. One month later, the myocardial infarction ameliorated, and he was transferred to our department. As the myocardial infarction had decreased the patient's tolerance to surgery, interferon-β was administered by intravenous infusion. The skin ulcer and red nodules on the lower left leg disappeared 26 weeks after infusion had been initiated. The patient's progress has been satisfactory, with no evidence of recurrence or metastasis at 1 year and 9 months after the initiation of intravenous infusion.
