Current public health physical activity (PA) guidelines suggest ≥500 METmin/week of PA, with additional benefits beyond 1000 METmin/week (i.e., a dose response). Revised U.S. PA guidelines are scheduled for 2018. The purpose was to relate health markers (blood pressure, percent fat, BMI, blood glucose, cholesterol, and cardiorespiratory fitness) to verify the dose response for PA guidelines revision. 505 non-smoking participants self-reported PA behaviors and completed medical screening. MANCOVA controlling for age and gender determined the relation between health markers and PA. MANCOVA indicated significantly (P<.001) different health markers of percent fat, BMI, glucose, and treadmill time as a function of PA. Post-hoc Helmert contrasts (1] <500 METmin/week vs. ≥500 METmin/week and 2] 500 to <1000 METmin/week vs. ≥1000 METmin/week) indicated that meeting the PA guidelines was associated with better health markers and higher cardiorespiratory fitness. Effect sizes were greater for contrast 1 than for contrast 2, suggesting a plateauing effect. Revised public health guidelines should consider achievement of ≥500 METmin/week to be most important, with additional modest gain thereafter. Revised PA guidelines should stress the importance of achieving 500–1000 METmin/week.
