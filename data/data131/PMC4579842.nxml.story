The role of laparoscopic resection for large gastric gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs), particularly those >5 cm, remains under debate due the possibility of intraoperative tumor rupture. To determine the feasibility and safety of the laparoscopic approach in the treatment of large gastric GISTs, a prospective study was performed between March 2011 and March 2014. Intraoperative tumor rupture was studied as the primary outcome. Secondary outcomes were the conversion rate, surgical duration, estimated blood loss, time to tolerate fluid and solid diets, length of post-operative hospital stay and recurrence rate at the end of the follow-up. A total of 16 patients were included in this study, with a tumor size of 7.04±1.53 cm (range, 5.2–10.8 cm). No intraoperative tumor rupture occurred. The median duration of surgery was 88.1±31.9 min, with an estimated blood loss volume of 37.1±18.7 ml. No patient required a blood transfusion. The mean time until the start of oral intake for fluid and solid diets was 1.1±0.6 and 2.5±0.9 days, respectively. The median length of post-operative hospital stay was 5.4±5.8 days. The follow-up period for all patients was 16.9±11.2 months (range, 2–38 months). No local or distant recurrence was observed. The study indicates that laparoscopic resection for large gastric GISTs is feasible and safe. Laparoscopic surgery should be considered as the standard approach in all cases, irrespective of tumor size or location.
