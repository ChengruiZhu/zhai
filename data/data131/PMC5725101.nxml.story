It is reported recently Tropomyosin-related receptor Kinase B (TrkB) plays key roles in the anoikis resistance during the processes of tumorigenesis and metastasis. However, its prognostic significance for clinical patients remains inconclusive. In order to establish a correct and practicable link between increased TrkB and prognostication of human solid tumors, a meta-analysis was performed in this article. A systematic literature research in the electronic databases PubMed, Embase and Web of Science was performed to identify eligible studies. A fixed-effects meta-analytical model was employed to correlate TrkB expression with OS, DFS and clinicopathological features. A total of 11 studies covering 1516 patients with various solid tumors were recruited in this meta-analysis. TrkB over-expression was associated with poorer OS and poorer DFS in multivariate analysis. Additionally, the pooled odds ratios (ORs) indicated that TrkB over-expression was associated with large tumor size, lymph node metastasis, distant metastasis and a higher clinical stage. Overall, these results indicated that TrkB over-expression in patients with solid tumors might be related to poor prognosis and serve as a potential predictive marker of poor clinicopathological prognosis factor.
