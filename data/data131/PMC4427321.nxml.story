The metabolism of malignant tumors is deranged. The transition from healthy to cancerous state involves, among other factors, the transcriptional coordination of genes spread throughout the cellâ€™s metabolic pathways. An examination of this multivariate regulatory effort can offer insights which may remain hidden from analyses focusing on a single gene in isolation. Such an analysis is particularly relevant for metabolic networks, whose constituent enzymes are fundamentally linked through their common utilization of a limited pool of substrates. Here, we examine the extent to which altered metabolism is reflected in the co-expression patterns of genes, shedding light on the differential regulation of metabolic genes within tumors. We study patterns of differential co-expression across metabolic pathways in both breast and kidney tumors, and integrate regulatory information to study the drivers of these changes. Among the results of our analysis is the apparent dsyregulation of genes controlled by HNF4A in clear-cell kidney tumors. Finally, by combining the results of our analyses across seven different tissues, we identify the recurrent decoupling of a set of mitochondrial genes, pointing to possible mitochondrial dysfunction in these cancers.
