With predicted increasing frequency and intensity of extremely hot weather due to
changing climate, workplace heat exposure is presenting an increasing challenge to
occupational health and safety. This article aims to review the characteristics of
workplace heat exposure in selected relatively high risk occupations, to summarize
findings from published studies, and ultimately to provide suggestions for workplace heat
exposure reduction, adaptations, and further research directions. All published
epidemiological studies in the field of health impacts of workplace heat exposure for the
period of January 1997 to April 2012 were reviewed. Finally, 55 original articles were
identified. Manual workers who are exposed to extreme heat or work in hot environments may
be at risk of heat stress, especially those in low-middle income countries in tropical
regions. At risk workers include farmers, construction workers, fire-fighters, miners,
soldiers, and manufacturing workers working around process-generated heat. The potential
impacts of workplace heat exposure are to some extent underestimated due to the
underreporting of heat illnesses. More studies are needed to quantify the extent to which
high-risk manual workers are physiologically and psychologically affected by or
behaviourally adapt to workplace heat exposure exacerbated by climate change.
