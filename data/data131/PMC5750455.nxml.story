Early childhood caries (ECC) is a considerable pediatric and public health problem worldwide. Preceding studies have focused primarily on bacterial diversity at the taxonomic level. Although these studies have provided significant information regarding the connection between dental caries and oral microbiomes, further comprehension of this microbial communityâ€™s ecological relevance is limited. This study identified the carbon source metabolic differences in dental plaque between children with and without ECC. We compared the microbial community functional diversity in 18 caries-free subjects with 18 severe ECC patients based on sole carbon source usage using a Biolog assay. The anaerobic microbial community in the ECC patients displayed greater metabolic activity than that of the control group. Specific carbon source metabolism differed significantly between the two groups. Subjects from the two groups were well distinguished by cluster and principal component analyses based on discriminative carbon sources. Our results implied that the microbial functional diversity between the ECC patients and healthy subjects differed significantly. In addition, the Biolog assay furthered our understanding of oral microbiomes as a composite of functional abilities, thus enabling us to identify the ecologically relevant functional differences among oral microbial communities.
