Free flaps, with their very high rates of success and low donor site morbidity, are considered the gold standard in head and neck reconstruction, allowing the transfer of ideal tissues for head and neck reconstruction. Nonetheless, under certain circumstances they may be contraindicated or cannot be utilized. We describe four subjects in which delayed locoregional flaps were used to reconstruct head and neck defects after a previous flap failure. Due to adverse anatomic and systemic conditions these patients were not suitable for a free flap, and thus one delayed prelaminated temporalis fasciocutaneous flap placement and three delayed supraclavicular flap (one of which was prelaminated) placements to reconstruct large defects of the cheek and commissural region needed to be performed. All flaps and grafts were viable. All patients in this case series had acceptable functional and aesthetic outcomes. Donor-site morbidity was negligible. Delayed locoregional flap placement required a total of three surgical sessions. Although limited, our experience suggests that in cases in which a free flap is contraindicated or not ideal, locoregional flaps may be a valid and safe alternative. Limitations of these procedures include increased duration of hospitalization and, foremost, the need for three-step surgery.
