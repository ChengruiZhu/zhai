The aim of the present meta-analysis was to compare the benefits of Bacillus Calmetter-Guerin (BCG) and mitomycin C in the treatment of patients with superficial bladder cancer. The present meta-analysis analyzed the benefits of BCG and mitomycin C in the treatment of patients with superficial bladder cancer by comparing progression-free survival (PFS) rates in patients treated with either of the drugs following transurethral resection. The Medline, Cochrane and EMBASE databases were searched between January 1966 and August 31, 2014 for studies that investigated the efficacy of the intravesical instillation of chemotherapy in patients with non-muscle invasive bladder cancer who had been treated with transurethral resection. Search terms included: ‘Urinary bladder neoplasms’, ‘superficial bladder cancer’ and ‘non-muscle invasive bladder cancer’; ‘bacillus Calmette-Guerin’ or ‘BCG’; ‘mitomycin C’; and ‘intravesical administration’. Sensitivity and data quality analyses were performed. A total of 6 randomized controlled studies were included with 1,289 patients. Complete 5-year PFS data for patients who received intravesical resection and were treated with mitomycin C or BCG was provided for 3 of the 6 studies, which were therefore included in the meta-analysis. The overall analysis revealed a significant benefit of BCG compared with mitomycin C in terms of 5-year PFS rate (odds ratio, 0.53; 95% confidence interval, 0.38–0.75; P<0.001), indicating that BCG was superior to mitomycin C therapy in patients with non-muscle invasive bladder cancer following transurethral resection.
