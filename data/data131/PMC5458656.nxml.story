Efficacy and safety up to 24 weeks of ipragliflozin therapy were analyzed in 367 patients and 451 patients, respectively. Hemoglobin A1c decreased significantly from 8.07% at the start of ipragliflozin therapy to 7.26% in week 24 (P < 0.001). Fasting and postprandial blood glucose levels were significantly reduced by ipragliflozin. In week 24, there were significant decreases from baseline in BW (-2.6 kg), waist circumference (-2.9 cm), and body fat mass (-1.9 kg) (P < 0.001). The body water mass and mineral mass were decreased significantly by 0.5 and by 0.1 kg, respectively (P < 0.001), whereas the protein mass did not change significantly. Intracellular water mass did not change significantly, whereas extracellular water mass showed a significant decrease of 0.5 kg (P < 0.001). Muscle mass did not change in the upper and lower limbs, but that of the trunk decreased significantly (P < 0.001). There was a significant decrease in the fasting triglyceride level and a significant increase in fasting high-density lipoprotein cholesterol level, while low-density lipoprotein cholesterol was unchanged. Adverse events occurred in 23.5% of the patients, with a high frequency of genital infections, such as vulvovaginal candidiasis (3.1%) and genital pruritus (1.8%). Adverse drug reactions were noted in 13.7% of the patients.
