A deeper understanding of the complex pathogenesis of multiple myeloma (MM) continues to lead to novel therapeutic approaches. Prior studies suggest that 3-phosphoinositide-dependent kinase 1 (PDK1) is expressed and active, acting as a crucial regulator of molecules that are essential for myelomagenesis. In the present study, we show that GSK2334470 (GSK-470), a novel and highly specific inhibitor of PDK1, induces potent cytotoxicity in MM cell lines including Dexamethasone-resistant cell line, but not in human normal cells. Insulin-like growth factor-1 could not rescue GSK-470-induced cell death. Moreover, GSK-470 down-modulates phosphor-PDK1, thereby inhibiting downstream phosphor-AKT at Thr308 and mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1) activity. However, GSK-470 could not affect mTORC2 activity and phosphor-AKT at Ser473. RPMI 8226 and OPM-2 cells with low expression of PTEN show relative resistant to GSK-470. Knockout of PTEN by shRNA resulted in a partial reversion of GSK-470-mediated growth inhibition, whereas overexpression of PTEN enhanced myeloma cell sensitivity to GSK-470, suggesting that the sensitivity to GSK-470 is correlated with PTEN expression statue in MM cells. Combining PP242, a dual mTORC1/C2 inhibitor, with GSK-470, had greater antimyeloma activity than either one alone
