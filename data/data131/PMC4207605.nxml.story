Daily actions frequently involve manipulation of tools and objects, such as stirring soup with a spoon or carrying a cup of coffee. Carrying the cup of coffee without spilling can be challenging as the coffee can only be indirectly controlled via moving the cup. Interaction forces between the cup and the coffee can be complex and, due to the nonlinear dynamics, lead to chaotic behavior. If unpredictable, an individual has to continuously react and compensate for the unexpected behavior. We hypothesized that when interacting continuously with such a complex object, humans seek a strategy that keeps the object's behavior predictable to avoid excessive sensorimotor processing. Using a simplified model of the cup of coffee, we analyzed forces and their relation to hand movements for rhythmic manipulation. Subjects practiced the modeled task in a virtual set-up for 50 trials. Experimental results show that subjects establish repeatable and predictable patterns. Importantly, the experiment was set up such that this increase in predictability was paralleled by an increase in exerted forces and a decrease in smoothness. Hence, this result showed that in complex object manipulation humans did not prioritize mechanical efficiency, but sought predictable interactions.
