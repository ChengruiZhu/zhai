 prior to various experiments being performed. Cellular proliferation, migration and tube formation ability were detected by DNA content quantification, Transwell assay and Matrigel-based angiogenesis assay. ELISA and western blot analysis measured protein secretion and expression, respectively. The results demonstrated that BM-EPCs cultured at pHe 6.5 compared with at pHe 7.4 demonstrated: Induced apoptosis; inhibited cellular proliferation, migration and adhesion; markedly reduced vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) expression; and the capacity to incorporate into vascular networks. Acidic pHe 6.5 induced ratio expression of B-cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl2)/Bcl2 associated X-protein (Bax), which in turn induced apoptosis, and inhibited cellular proliferation and other functional activities, with involvement of activation of VEGF receptor 2, protein kinase B and p38 mitogen activated protein kinase. These observations raise the possibility that the acidic extracellular environment may perform an important role in the vasculogenesis of BM-EPCs in tumor microenvironments. Therefore, culturing cancer cells at a lower pH that simulates endogenous tumor conditions may improve retention of the cellular heterogeneity identified in tumors.
