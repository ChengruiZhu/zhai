The cuticular layer that covers all aerial parts of plants plays a vital role not only in the interaction with environment but also in plant development and growth. Despite the recent significant achievements in the identification of structural genes involved in cuticle biosynthesis and secretion, little is known regarding the regulation of metabolic pathways generating cuticular constituents, more specifically wax and cutin. The Arabidopsis AP2-type transcription factor SHINE1/WAX INDUCER1 (SHN1/WIN1) was the first assigned regulator of a cuticle-related metabolic pathway; nevertheless, its mode of action and biological function remain uncertain due to redundancy with two additional clade members. Here, by co-silencing all three SHN clade members using an artificial microRNAs approach, we demonstrated that SHN transcription factors act redundantly in patterning reproductive organ surface, modulating processes associated with cell elongation, adhesion, and separation, which secure the proper function of these organs. It appears that SHN transcription factors act directly on downstream cutin and cell wallâ€“modifying genes. These factors are likely part of the genetic network controlling floral organ development. Thus, SHN transcription factors link together cuticle assembly, cell wall remodeling, and flower development to form the archetypal surface of floral organs mediating plant reproduction through pollination and seed dispersal.
