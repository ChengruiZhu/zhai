For many common afflictions, it is difficult to map disease-associated loci because multiple loci are involved, with some loci playing greater roles than others. To explore how complex interactions can contribute to disease, we examined an incompatibility involving the MLH1 and PMS1 DNA mismatch repair proteins in baker's yeast. In our system, an incompatibility is defined as a defect occurring when specific combinations of MLH1 and PMS1 proteins obtained from different baker's yeast strains are tested for function. We identified amino acid differences at only one site in each protein that contributed to this incompatibility. We also showed that amino acid differences that could cause such an incompatibility are found in strains collected from across the globe. No strain contained the incompatible MLH1-PMS1 combination, indicating that it was likely to be deleterious. When such a combination was created in the laboratory, we could detect a wide range of defects that were under the control of genetic modifiers. These observations provide a powerful model in which to understand the basis of disease penetrance and how segregation of defects in mismatch repair may allow for rapid yet reversible changes in genomic mutation rates that can help yeast adapt to changing or novel environments.
