The association of the cytotoxic T lymphocyte-associated antigen 4 (CTLA-4) gene and susceptibility to autoimmune thyroid diseases (AITDs) has been studied extensively. However, the results were not the same in different ethnic groups. We updated the meta-analysis of association of CTLA-4 gene polymorphisms with AITDs and summarized the results in specific ethnicity. The associations of A49G gene polymorphism with GD, A49G gene polymorphism with HT, CT60 gene polymorphism with GD, and CT60 gene polymorphism with HT were summarized based on the literatures published up to October 30, 2014, in English or Chinese languages. The participants involved in the studies of A49G with GD, A49G with HT, CT60 with GD, and CT60HT were 39004 subjects (in 51 studies), 13102 subjects (in 22 studies), 31446 subjects (in 22 studies), and 6948 subjects (in 8 studies), respectively. The pooled ORs of CTLA-4 gene polymorphisms with AITDs were larger than 1.00, and the 95% CIs of ORs were statistically significant among whole population analyses. However, the subgroup analysis demonstrated that pooled ORs of A49G polymorphisms with GD among Africans or Americans are less than 1.00. The accumulated evidence suggests that the G allele mutant of A49G and CT60 increased the risks of HT and GD.
