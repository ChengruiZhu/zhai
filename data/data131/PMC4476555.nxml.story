Perception of the environment relies on neuronal computation in the cerebral cortex. However, the exact algorithms by which cortical neuronal networks process relevant information from the inputs of sensory organs are only poorly understood. To address this problem we stimulated distinct whiskers and recorded the neuronal responses from identified cortical whisker representations of the rat using multi-site electrodes. For rodents the whisker system is one main sensory input channel, offering the unique property that for each whisker an identified cortical area ("barrel-related column") represents its main cortical input station. In the present study we were able to demonstrate that the action potential firing of single inhibitory neurons provides more information about behaviorally relevant qualities of whisker stimulation (identity of the stimulated whisker and frequency of stimulation) than excitatory neurons. In addition, information about stimulation qualities was encoded with less redundancy in inhibitory neurons. In summary, the results of our study suggest that inhibitory neurons carry substantial information about the sensory environment and can thereby adequately orchestrate neuronal activity in sensory cortices.
