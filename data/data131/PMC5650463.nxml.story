Reactive oxygen species (ROS) are generated after exposure to harmful environmental factors and during normal cellular metabolic processes. The balance of the generating and scavenging of ROS plays a significant role in living cells. The accumulation of ROS will lead to oxidative damage to biomolecules including nucleic acid. Although many types of oxidative nucleic acid damage products have been identified, 8-oxo-7,8-dihydro-2â€™-deoxyguanosine (8-oxodG) and 8-oxo-7,8-dihydroguanosine (8-oxoG) has been commonly chosen as the biomarkers of oxidative damage to DNA and RNA, respectively. It has been demonstrated that oxidative damage to nucleic acid is an initiator in pathogenesis of numerous diseases. Thus, oxidative nucleic acid damage biomarkers have the potential to be utilized for detection of diseases. Herein, we reviewed the relationship of oxidative nucleic acid damage and development of various diseases including cancers (colorectal cancer, gastrointestinal cancer, breast cancer, lung cancer, epithelial ovarian carcinoma, esophageal squamous cell carcinoma), neurodegenerative disorders and chronic diseases (diabetes and its complications, cardiovascular diseases). The potential of oxidative nucleic acid damage biomarkers for detection of diseases and drug development were described. Moreover, the approaches for detection of these biomarkers were also summarized.
