Unilateral nostril hypoplasia is an extremely rare congenital malformation of unknown etiology, and only a few cases have been reported in literature. Owing to variability and complexity of the deformity, surgical correction of unilateral nostril hypoplasia represents one of the most significant reconstructive challenges to reconstructive plastic surgeons. We report a 7-year-old Vietnamese child with nasal and periocular deformity resembling a craniofacial cleft. Grossly, the right nostril was patent but with alar rim deformity, and the left nostril was not readily identifiable. A dystopic medial canthus was present on the left side as well. Closer inspection and palpation of the left side of nose revealed a patency through the soft tissue and underlying bony structure, Thus, a new alar rim were reconstructed with an irregularly shaped Z-plasty to create patency on the involved side. Simulatneously, a second Z-plasty was performed to address the medial canthal deformity. Postoperative appearance and function was sastisfactory at one-year follow up visit. In the treatment of patients with nostril hypoplasia, a careful preoperative physical examination is a prerequisite, and Z-plasty can be a valuable option for surgical correction.
