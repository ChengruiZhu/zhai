This study concerns the encapsulation and controlled release of both hydrophobic and hydrophilic medications with one polymer, which are delivered together as a combined therapy to treat diseased tissue. To test our hypothesis that the novel PEG-graft-PLA (PEG, polyethylene glycol; PLA, polylactic acid) can deliver both the hydrophobic and hydrophilic medications on account of its amphiphility, charge, and graft structure, PEG-graft-PLA (molecular weight of PEG = 1900) with very low critical micelle concentration was synthesized. One hydrophilic (insulin) and one hydrophobic (naproxen) model medication were loaded in separately during its self-assembly in aqueous solution. The resulting nanoparticles (NPs) were narrowly distributed and spherical, with average particle size around 200 nm, zeta potential >âˆ’10 mV, and encapsulation efficiency >50%. The NPs realized controlled release of insulin and naproxen for over 24 and 160 hours, respectively. Specifically, the bioactivity of the insulin released from the NPs was maintained. Owing to encapsulation, both for hydrophobic and hydrophilic medicines, and NPs obtained with similar size and zeta potential, as well as maintenance of bioactivity of loaded protein, we expect the applications of PEG-graft-PLA NPs in combination therapy.
