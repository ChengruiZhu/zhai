Pillar and pit substrates caused heterogeneous spatial growth and distribution, with differences in cell density, over 48Â h. Regional densities and distribution were significantly increased at pillar sidewalls, and at pit sidewalls and bottoms compared with those on flat unpatterned areas. Time-lapse observations revealed that different mechanisms of cell migration were dependent upon pillar and pit features. Cells on pillar substrate migrated towards the sidewall, whereas cells on pit substrate tended to move towards the sidewalls and bottom. Cytoskeletal staining of F-actin and vinculin showed that this migration can be attributed to difference in spatial reorganization of actin cytoskeleton, and the formation of focal adhesions at various points on the at the convex and concave corners of pillar and pit substrates. Cells cultured on the pillar substrate had stress fibers with extended filopodia and immature focal contacts at the sidewalls and convex corners, similar to those on the flat unpatterned substrate. Cells at the sidewalls and concave corners of pit substrate had more contractile stress fibers and stable focal contacts compared with cells on the pillar substrate. We also found that the substrate structures affect cell-cell contact formation
