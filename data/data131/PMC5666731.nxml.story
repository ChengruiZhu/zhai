Background: Rare diseases represent a challenge for physicians because patients are rarely seen, and they can manifest with symptoms similar to those of common diseases. In this work, genetic confirmation of diagnosis is derived from DNA sequencing. We present a tutorial for the molecular analysis of a rare disease using Fabry disease as an example. Methods: An exonic sequence derived from a hypothetical male patient was matched against human reference data using a genome browser. The missense mutation was identified by running BlastX, and information on the affected protein was retrieved from the database UniProt. The pathogenic nature of the mutation was assessed with PolyPhen-2. Disease-specific databases were used to assess whether the missense mutation led to a severe phenotype, and whether pharmacological therapy was an option. Results: An inexpensive bioinformatics approach is presented to get the reader acquainted with the diagnosis of Fabry disease. The reader is introduced to the field of pharmacological chaperones, a therapeutic approach that can be applied only to certain Fabry genotypes. Conclusion: The principle underlying the analysis of exome sequencing can be explained in simple terms using web applications and databases which facilitate diagnosis and therapeutic choices.
