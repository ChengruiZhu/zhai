Acquired stenosis of the external auditory canal may be caused by a variety of insults, all sharing a common pathogenesis, namely a cascade of inflammatory changes leading to medial canal fibrosis. Previous surgery (canaloplasty or meatoplasty) and radiotherapy, especially if associated with a history of parotid surgery extended to the external auditory canal, have been implicated as possible causes. The literature offers advice on the management of stenosis consequent to otosurgery for congenital and acquired defects, but nothing on forms secondary to radiotherapy to the head and neck region. The proposed solutions are often cumbersome and difficult to fabricate, and therefore expensive. The aim of this paper, in which the cases of four patients are reported, is to present a new technique initially used for the most severe form – i.e. external auditory canal stenosis after surgery and radiotherapy – and then extended to forms due to different causes. This new technique involves the use of a series of surgical steel tubes of increasing dimension commonly used for tissue expansion in a body piercing practice called stretching and known as ear stretching tunnels or ear stretchers. This innovative approach proved effective in solving external auditory canal stenosis in our patients, with the least discomfort for the patient and the lowest cost. We consider this new solution to be feasible and practical and are convinced that it provides a new approach to an old problem. Further studies are needed to increase the number of clinical cases to verify how long the ear stretcher should be kept in place for the stenosis to stabilise, and to establish whether surgery is always necessary after ear stretcher application and, if so, the best timing for surgery.
