Cyclic edema is a clinical condition in women that leads to fluid retention in the orthostatic position. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the prevalence of idiopathic cyclic edema in women with lower limb lymphedema. The prevalence of idiopathic cyclic edema was evaluated in a retrospective study of 100 consecutive female patients submitted to leg lymphedema treatment at the Clínica Godoy. The diagnosis of lymphedema was clinical, based on patient history and a physical examination. Patients with clinical stage II lymphedema were included in the study with those in stages I and III being excluded. The diagnosis of idiopathic cyclic edema was based on the patient’s history and fluid retention of more than one kilogram between 7:00 a.m. and 5:00 p.m. Clinical signs of this disease include difficulty removing rings in the morning that becomes easier during the course of the day, waking up with a swollen face, and abdominal discomfort during the day. After diagnosing cyclic edema, a therapeutic test was performed using aminaphtone or calcium dobesilate with which fluid retention was reduced to less than 300 g during the same period. The patients were instructed to drink liquids only when they were thirsty.
