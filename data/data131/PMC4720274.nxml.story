Why, and how, organisms age and ultimately die is a key question of modern biology. Telomeres are considered molecular timekeepers determining cellular lifespans. Within an organism, tissue proliferation is expected to dictate the rate at which telomeres shorten. Using zebrafish, an organism with human-like telomeres, we set out to test whether, in natural aging, proliferative tissues age faster than non-proliferative in a telomere-dependent manner. We found that telomeres shorten with age to a level where they trigger telomere associated DNA damage and culminate in tissue dysfunction, independently of high or low tissue proliferation rates. Specifically, short telomeres accumulate in the gut, a highly proliferative tissue, and in the muscle, a low proliferative tissue, working as direct predictors of cellular damage prior to onset of intestinal inflammation and myocyte degeneration. Based on our data, we propose a model where telomere shortening in these key tissues is sufficient to trigger damage in others and precedes the onset of organism age-associated diseases, namely cancer. Thus, tissue-specific telomere length is limiting for local and systemic physiological integrity, leading to tissue degeneration and disease in aging.
