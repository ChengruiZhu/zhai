Schools, offices, hospitals play an important role in the spreading of epidemics. Information about interactions between individuals in such contexts can help understand the patterns of transmission and design ad hoc immunization strategies. Data about contacts can be collected through various techniques such as diaries or proximity sensors. Here, we first ask if the corresponding datasets give similar predictions of the epidemic risk when they are used to build a network of contacts among individuals. Not surprisingly, the answer is negative: indeed, if we consider data from sensors as the ground truth, diaries are affected by low participation rate, underreporting and overestimation of durations. Is it however possible, despite these biases, to use data from contact diaries to obtain sensible epidemic risk predictions? We show here that, thanks to the structural similarities between the two networks, it is possible to use the contact diaries to build surrogate versions of the contact network obtained from the sensor data, such that both yield the same epidemic risk estimation. We show that the construction of such surrogate networks can be performed using solely the information contained in the contact diaries, complemented by publicly available data on the heterogeneity of cumulative contact durations between individuals.
