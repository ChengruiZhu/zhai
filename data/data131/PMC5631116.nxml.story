Since 2011, X-TLC has conducted 308,038 HIV screens, and 63.7 % of those tested were women. Overall seroprevalence for HIV was 0.56 %, and 30.5 % of HIV patients identified were cis-gender women (seroprevalence 0.15 %). The seroprevalence for women testing in EDs was higher (0.44 %). Similar to men, only 52.9 % of HIV positive women were new diagnoses. Women accounted for 28.5 % of all new diagnoses, compared with 15.4 % for Chicago overall. In 2016 X-TLC screened 91,865 persons for HIV, and 65.2 % of those tested were women. There were 193 new diagnosis and 32.1 % (62) were women, 85.7 % AA. In comparison, in 2015 there were 139 women with a new HIV diagnosis for all of Chicago. Women newly diagnosed were less likely to be linked to care (adjusted odds ratio, aOR, 0.54, 0.35–0.85). Linkage was lower for women diagnosed at CHCs (84.6 % vs. 76.3 %, P = 0.02). Most CHCs did not have on site HIV providers. At our site, however, women linked to care were more likely to be retained in care (aOR 0.58, 0.43–0.78). We also conduct targeted outreach testing, partner services (PS) testing, and social network strategy (SNS) testing, but women are not identified by these programs (16/171 tested women, 8 new diagnoses were men for PS; 507 tested, 471 men and 36 trans-gender women, 38 new positives, 0 cis-gender women for SNS).
