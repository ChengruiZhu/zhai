Noninvasive techniques for nail imaging would be useful for confirming diagnosis and monitoring treatment response at the microscopic level in patients with nail psoriasis. However, the use of ultrasound and high-resolution magnetic resonance imaging in nail evaluation is limited. Optical coherence tomography (OCT) produces high-resolution images of transversal tissue sections and represents an optimal approach to the study of the nail. This study used a multibeam OCT instrument to produce speckled variance OCT (SV-OCT) blood-flow images, which were used to measure the degree of change over successive scans. Nail changes, inflammation and response to therapy were evaluated in a 75-year-old female patient with psoriasis who had severe acrodermatitis continua of Hallopeau of the hands, treated for 4 weeks with 40 mg adalimumab (administered subcutaneously every other week) and 25 mg prednisone (administered orally, daily). SV-OCT provided a detailed assessment of the nail structures in relation to inflammation of psoriatic tissues. Restoration of the normal anatomy of the nail apparatus was apparent following adalimumab treatment; SV-OCT evaluation correlated with clinical appearance. SV-OCT may have a diagnostic role and provide an objective tool to assess clinical and subclinical inflammation in nail psoriasis.
