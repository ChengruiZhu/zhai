Many individuals with a family history of colorectal cancer have no detectable germline mutation in the known cancer predisposing genes. We aimed to identify novel susceptibility genes for this common phenotype by performing exome sequencing on 96 independent cases with familial colorectal cancer. Eighty-six patients had one affected first-degree relative, and ten patients had two or more. None of the patients had a previous diagnosis of a hereditary syndrome. We focused our search on genes with rare variants, predicted to truncate the protein product, since these are likely candidates for disease predisposition. Using this approach we identified truncating germline variants in eleven genes, present in two or three independent familial colorectal cancer cases. We analyzed the respective tumor DNAs and found loss of the wild-type allele in seven out of seven occasions, involving four genes. No tumor showed loss of the mutant allele which provides us with additional evidence for disease causality. Further studies are required to provide firm evidence for pathogenicity. Genetic knowledge on confirmed predisposing genes can ultimately be translated into tools for cancer prevention and early diagnosis in individuals carrying predisposition alleles.
