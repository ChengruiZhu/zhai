Non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) accounts for most lung cancer cases. Therapeutic interventions integrating the use of different agents that focus on different targets are needed to overcome this set of diseases. The proteasome system has been demonstrated clinically as a potent therapeutic target for haematological cancers. However, promising preclinical data in solid tumors are yet to be confirmed in clinics. Herein, the combinational use of Bortezomib (BZM) and 2-aminoethoxydiphenylborane (2-APB) toward NSCLC cells was studied. We confirmed that BZM-triggered cytoprotective autophagy that may counteract with the cytotoxic effects of the drug per se. 2-APB was selected from screening of a commercial natural compounds library, which potentiated BZM-induced cytotoxicity. Such an enhancement effect was associated with 2-APB-mediated autophagy inhibition. In addition, we revealed that 2-APB suppressed calcium-induced autophagy in H1975 and A549 NSCLC cells. Interestingly, BZM [0.3 mg/kg/3 days] combined with 2-APB [2 mg/kg/day] significantly inhibited both primary (around 47% tumor growth) and metastatic Lewis lung carcinoma after a 20-day treatment. Our results suggested that BZM and 2-APB combination therapy can potentially be developed as a novel formulation for lung cancer treatment.
