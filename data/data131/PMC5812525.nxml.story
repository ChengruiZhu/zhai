Cerebellar stroke increases the risk of extensive physical disability and long-term institutionalization. The purpose of this case report is to describe the 14-month longitudinal rehabilitation management and outcomes from the intensive care unit, inpatient rehabilitation unit and outpatient care of a patient after cerebellar stroke. A goal of this case report is to provide rehabilitation clinicians with a long-term perspective and understanding of the course of recovery for a patient after cerebellar cerebrovascular accident or related injury. A 51-year-old healthy athletic female experienced acute bilateral cerebellar infarcts with subsequent craniotomy to remove infarcted areas. The patient had postoperative hemorrhages and hydrocephalus and was deemed to have a poor prognosis. Multimodal sensory stimulation and early mobility was performed until conventional neuromuscular reeducation interventions could be tolerated. Primary deficits included decreased proximal strength, whole body ataxia, vertical diplopia, dysphagia, difficulty communicating, and emotional lability. Fourteen months after the initial infarcts, the patient was able to reside in her own home with her husband, ambulate, and stand with assistance and perform most activities of daily living with standby or set-up assistance. This patient made significant progress toward safety and mobility and was able to return home despite the early discussion about a poor prognosis and a palliative care consultation. The complex, intensive course of rehabilitation elicited slow, steady, consistent gains. The patient’s motivation and family involvement likely facilitated optimum outcomes.
