) and subjected to 30 minutes of left anterior descending coronary artery occlusion followed by 6 or 24 hours of reperfusion. Only the higher dose significantly lowered systolic blood pressure, the lower dose causing a smaller apparent lowering that was nonsignificant. Despite this difference in blood pressure‐lowering effect, both doses increased the ejection fraction and fractional shortening and reduced myocardial infarct size equally. I/R decreased cardiac expression of phosphatidylinositol 3‐kinase (PI3K), phospho‐Akt and phospho‐endothelial nitric oxide synthase (phospho‐eNOS), but increased expression of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS); these changes were all abrogated by aliskiren. Moreover, aliskiren decreased superoxide anion generation and increased cyclic guanosine‐3′,5′‐monophosphate, an index of bioactive nitric oxide, in myocardium. It also decreased the expression of myocardial matrix metalloproteinase‐2, matrix metalloproteinase‐9, and tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases‐1 (TIMP‐1) following I/R. In a Langendorff heart preparation, the detrimental cardiac effects of I/R were abrogated by aliskiren, and these protective effects were abolished by NOS or PI3K inhibition. In a parallel study, although specific iNOS inhibition reduced plasma malondialdehyde and myocardial superoxide anion generation, it did not affect the deleterious effects of I/R on myocardial structure and function.
