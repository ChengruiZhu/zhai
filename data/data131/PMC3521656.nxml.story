A cell's genome is encoded within double-strand DNA. Yet DNA must exist transiently in single-strand form to template transcription, replication, and repair. As DNA is more prone to damage in single-strand (ssDNA) than double-strand (dsDNA) form, there can be agents that mutate ssDNA, but not dsDNA. Since existing experimental systems cannot identify mutagens specifically mutating ssDNA inside cells, we devised a system of yeast strains, containing three closely-spaced reporter genes, for this purpose. We exposed yeast, under conditions where reporter DNA is single-stranded, either to an enzyme (APOBEC3G) or to a chemical (sulfites) that modifies cytosine, resulting in clusters of mutations that inactivated multiple reporter genes. Neither agent induced mutations in control strains where reporter genes remained double-stranded, confirming that both are potent ssDNA–specific mutagens within cells. Finally, our approach ascertained molecular mechanisms of action by which agents can mutate ssDNA specifically within cells, an area that warrants much investigation following reports that ssDNA–specific damage accounts for similar mutation clusters, and up to 40% of all mutations, in various cancers.
