Long-standing burns, fissures, and ulcers that undergo malignant transformation into a variety of
malignancies, including squamous cell carcinoma, is commonly referred to as a Marjolin's ulcer. It is well recognized
that squamous cell carcinomas of the lung and esophagus can cause humoral hypercalcemia of
malignancy secondary to paraneoplastic secretion of parathyroid hormone-related peptide. However, it is extremely
rare for a squamous cell carcinoma developing in a sacral decubitus ulcer to cause humoral hypercalcemia of
malignancy. We describe the first case of a patient found to have elevated serum levels of parathyroid hormone related
peptide related to his Marjolin's ulcer. A 45-year-old African American man with T6 paraplegia and a sacral decubitus ulcer present for 20 years was admitted for hypercalcemia of unclear etiology. He was subsequently found to have elevated parathyroid hormone related peptide and an excisional biopsy from the ulcer showed invasive squamous cell carcinoma suggestive of humoral hypercalcemia of malignancy. 
The patient ultimately succumbed to sepsis while receiving chemotherapy for his metastatic squamous cell
carcinoma. Humoral hypercalcemia of malignancy is a rare and likely underrecognized complication that can occur
in a Marjolin's ulcer.
