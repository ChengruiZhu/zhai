Macrophages play a critical role in tumor invasion and metastasis, which remain major causes of mortality in patients with hypopharyngeal cancer. Here we investigate the effect of an oncogene, AEG-1 expressed in macrophages on the invasion of hypopharyngeal cancer cells. AEG-1 is more highly expressed in macrophages of human hypopharyngeal cancer samples compared with adjacent non-tumor controls. Using matrigel invasion assay system, THP-1-derived macrophages with forced AEG-1 overexpression enhance FaDu cell invasion whereas macrophages with AEG-1 silence inhibit. Matrix metalloproteinase 9 (MMP-9), which is important in tumor invasion and metastasis through degrading extracellular matrix, is up-reulated by AEG-1 partly through NF-ÎºB p65 in macrophages. Intriguingly, macrophage AEG-1 also induces MMP-9 up-regulated expression in FaDu cells. Furthermore, macrophage AEG-1 activates signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) in FaDu cells, which is responsible for macrophage AEG-1-induced an increase in MMP-9 expression and invasion of FaDu cells. This is the first to demonstrate that macrophage AEG-1 promotes tumor invasion through up-regulation of MMP-9 in both macrophages and cancer cells. Thus, the results provide evidences that macrophage AEG-1 contributes to promotion of tumor invasion, and represents as a potential target in hypopharyngeal cancer therapy.
