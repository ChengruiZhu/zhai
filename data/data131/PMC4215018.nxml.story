Diabetic peripheral neuropathy (DPN) is an important microvascular complication of diabetes mellitus (DM). It is a major contributor to foot ulceration and lower limb amputation in persons with DM and have also a significant negative effect on patient's quality of life. This meta-analysis reviews prevalence of DPN among patients with type 1 and 2 DM in Iran. Using PubMed and NLM Gateway (for MEDLINE), Institute of Scientific Information (ISI), and SCOPUS as the main international electronic data sources, and Iranmedex, Irandoc, and Scientific Information Database (SID), as the main domestic databases with systematic search capability, we systematically searched surveys, papers, and reports on the prevalence of DPN (between January 1991 to February 2013). Heterogeneity of reported prevalenceâ€™s between studies was assessed by the Chi-square-based Q test and due to heterogeneity; overall prevalence of DPN was estimated using random-effect meta-analysis model. We found 304 records; from them a total of 21 studies comprising 5540 diabetic patients were included. The prevalence of diabetic neuropathy (reported) from 16% to 87%. In overall the prevalence of DPN estimated 53% (95% CI: 41-65) by using random-effect. This study show that the prevalence of DPN seems very high among the population with diabetes in Iran and more than half of the patients with DM has any type of diabetic neuropathy.
