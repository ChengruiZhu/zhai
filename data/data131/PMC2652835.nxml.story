Genetic drift can be a strong evolutionary force, especially in small populations. Studies of HIV evolution within a single infected patient suggest that genetic drift plays an important role in the evolution of the virus, despite the large size of the viral population. The factors responsible for the high genetic drift are not known, but several models have been proposed to explain the phenomenon; all of them assume that the viral population is ideal. We measured the amount of genetic drift in HIV populations, replicating in the controlled environment of cell culture. We found that HIV populations exhibit approximately 10-fold more genetic drift than would be expected for an ideal population of similar size. Non-synchronous timing of infection is partially responsible for the increase, but other unidentified factors also contribute. While the increase in genetic drift observed for HIV in culture is not sufficient to explain the several orders of magnitude increase in intra-patient genetic drift, it provides strong experimental evidence for the intrinsic stochasticity of the HIV replication cycle. Understanding the sources of genetic drift is necessary to better understand the evolutionary forces that act upon HIV
