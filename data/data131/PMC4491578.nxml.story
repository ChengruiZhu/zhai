A 45-year-old male being otherwise healthy presented acute onset of right upper extremity ischemia. On physical examination, axillary artery could be palpated whereas the brachial artery could not be palpated below the level of the antecubital fossa, including radial and ulnar artery pulses. Pulses were also inaudible with pocket-ultrasound below the level of the brachial artery bifurcation. The patient was initially diagnosed to have acute thromboembolic occlusion and given 5000â€‰IU intravenous heparin. The patient was taken to the operating room. We noticed that the ischemic symptoms disappeared within a couple of minutes just before we began the operation. However, ischemic symptoms reappeared six hours later and computed tomography angiography showed lack of enhancement below the elbow crease. We were taking the patient to the operating room for the second time when the symptoms recovered in a few minutes, again. The operation was not canceled anymore. In the operation, the brachial artery was found anomalously perforating and it was entrapped by the bicipital aponeurosis. The artery was relieved by resecting the aponeurosis and there was no need for any other intervention. The patient had no more recurrence of symptoms postoperatively.
