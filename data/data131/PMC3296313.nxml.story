Macrophages are terminally differentiated cells of the mononuclear phagocytic lineage and develop under the stimulus of their primary growth and differentiation factor, CSF-1. Although they differentiate into heterogeneous populations, depending upon their tissue of residence, motility is an important aspect of their function. To facilitate their migration through tissues, macrophages express a unique range of adhesion and cytoskeletal proteins. Notably, macrophages do not form large, stable adhesions or actin stress fibers but rely on small, short lived point contacts, focal complexes and podosomes for traction. Thus, macrophages are built to respond rapidly to migratory stimuli. As well as triggering growth and differentiation, CSF-1 is also a chemokine that regulates macrophage migration via activation the CSF-1 receptor tyrosine kinase. CSF-1R autophosphorylation of several intracellular tyrosine residues leads to association and activation of many downstream signaling molecules. However, phosphorylation of just one residue, Y721, mediates association of PI3K with the receptor to activate the major motility signaling pathways in macrophages. Dissection of these pathways will identify drug targets for the inhibition of diseases in which macrophages contribute to adverse outcomes.
