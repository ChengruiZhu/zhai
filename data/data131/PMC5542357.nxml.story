134 pectoralis major tendon ruptures were treated surgically. The average age was 34 years (15 to 61). 18% were laborers and the most common mechanism of injury was weight lifting (62%). The average time from injury to surgery was 10 weeks. 76% were acute, 8% were subacute, and 16% were chronic ruptures. Operative findings revealed a tendon rupture in 92% of cases (122/134), a musculotendinous rupture in 13% (18/134), and 0.7% partial tears (1/134). Surgical repair techniques consisted of suture anchors (40%), sutures through bone tunnels (25%), suture button (19%), and an end-to-end suture repair (8%). Six patients (4%) needed allograft augmentation at the time of surgery. There were 17 complications (13%): 4 infections, 5 cosmetic wound concerns, 1 transient neuropraxia, 2 fractures, 2 postoperative frozen shoulders, and 3 failures. Surgical treatment with bone tunnels was associated with the highest complication rate in this series (5%), followed by suture anchors (4.4%), end-to-end repair (2.2%), and suture button repair (0.74%). One patient had a re operation, which was for a failed repair (0.7%). The average follow up time was 71 days (1-2268 days). 86% of patients were able to return to their occupation at full capacity. The complications rates between each method of repair seen in our study were not statistically different from one another. When “implant” versus “no implant” was evaluated, we found that use of an implant was associated with a lower re-tear rate (p=.0782), a lower rate of fracture (p=.0782), and a lower rate of post operative stiffness (p=0.0782), and all 3 trended toward significance.
