Tetra DIIIC is a vaccine candidate against dengue virus (DENV) composed by four chimeric proteins that fuse the domain III of the envelope protein of each virus to the corresponding capsid protein. Containing B- and T-cell epitopes, these proteins form aggregates after the incubation with an immunostimulatory oligodeoxynucleotide, and their tetravalent formulation induces neutralizing antibodies and cellular immune response in mice and monkeys. Also, Tetra DIIIC protects mice after challenge with each DENV, and the monovalent formulation obtained from DENV-2 protects monkeys upon homologous viral challenge. However, in the last years, new evidences have arisen regarding domain III of DENV envelope protein as irrelevant target for neutralizing antibodies in humans. Nevertheless, vaccination with domain III induces a neutralizing antibody response that confers protection against re-infection. In addition, it has been demonstrated that the induction of a cellular immune response is essential to protect during the infection. This response can also avoid severe manifestations of dengue disease, associated to the antibody-dependent enhancement of the infection. In this study, we observed that Tetra DIIIC was able to boost the antiviral and neutralizing antibody responses previously generated in monkeys during an experimental DENV infection, demonstrating that domain III is targeted by B cells during the viral infection. Additionally, Tetra DIIIC successfully boosted the cellular immune response generated by the viruses, probably against T-cells epitopes in the capsid proteins. These results highlight the functionality of Tetra DIIIC as a vaccine candidate against DENV.
