Antibiotics have saved the lives of millions. However, the emergence and spread of antibiotic resistance compromises the effectiveness of antibiotics. Genes conferring antibiotic resistance are often located on genetic elements that can be transferred to other bacteria. Conjugation is the predominant route responsible for spreading antibiotic resistance genes, and depends critically on a class of proteins called relaxases. These enzymes initiate conjugation by processing the DNA of the mobile element and are therefore an AchillesÂ´ heel of the conjugation process. Although antibiotic resistance is an important health threat in both Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria, conjugation has so far been studied primarily in Gram-negative bacteria. Due to the extremely high concentration of bacteria, which favors conjugation, the intestinal gut is a hotspot for spreading antibiotic resistance. It is now known that a large part of the gut microbiome corresponds to Gram-positive bacteria, and many of these belong to the phylum Firmicutes. To better understand conjugation and specifically relaxases of Gram-positive conjugative elements we have identified and characterized the relaxase and the DNA region at which it acts of the conjugative plasmid pLS20 from the Gram-positive Firmicute
