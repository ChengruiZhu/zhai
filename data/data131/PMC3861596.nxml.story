Lung cancer is the most common cause of cancer-related mortality worldwide. It is necessary to improve the understanding of the molecular mechanisms involved in lung cancer in order to develop more effective therapeutics for the treatment of this fatal disease. The canonical Wnt signaling pathway has been known to be important in a number of cancer types, including lung cancer. Pygopus (Pygo) is a recently identified downstream component of the Wnt signaling pathway required for β-catenin/T-cell factor (TCF)-dependent transcription. However, the role of Pygo in lung cancer remains to be elucidated. The present study showed that Pygo2 is overexpressed in human lung cancer tissue samples and cell lines. Expression levels of Pygo2 were found to correlate with cytosolic β-catenin protein levels in the samples examined. Co-immunofluorescent staining showed that Pygo2 protein accumulated in the nuclei and colocalized with nuclear β-catenin in lung cancer cell lines expressing Pygo2. To investigate the functional importance of the Pygo2 overexpression in lung cancer, short hairpin RNA (shRNA) was used to knockdown Pygo2 mRNA in lung cancer cells expressing the gene. Pygo2 shRNA was observed to inhibit cell proliferation and decrease β-catenin/TCF-dependent transcriptional activity
