Methane is a highly potent greenhouse gas and ruminants are the major source of methane emissions from anthropogenic activities. Here we show in an experiment with cattle that genetic selection of low-emitting animals is a viable option based on a newly developed selection criterion. The experimental data provided a comprehensive insight into the host additive genetic influence on the microbiome, the impact of nutrition on genetics and the microbiome, and the effect of metagenomic microbial genes on the analysed traits. We developed a selection criterion to change those traits by evaluation of hosts based on the relative abundance of microbial genes. This criterion is shown to be highly informative and it is therefore suggested to be used in studies analysing different traits and species. This study provides a proof of principle that there is an additive genetic influence of the host on its microbiome and that selection for the desired host can be based on the abundance of a suite of genes in the ruminal metagenome associated with the trait. The use of this criterion will allow genetic analysis on a large number of hosts, previously a significant barrier to determination of host genetic effects on such traits.
