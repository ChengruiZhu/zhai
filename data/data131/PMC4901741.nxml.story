Between the years of 2003 and 2011, 2,965 consecutive athletes were evaluated. Forty-nine athletes were identified with a pre-existing rotator cuff tear; twenty-two of these athletes underwent surgical intervention for their tear and 27 were treated non-operatively. Those who attended the NFL Combine with a history of a rotator cuff tear were significantly less likely to be drafted than those without a previous injury (55.1% vs. 77.5% respectively, p = 0.002) (Table 1A). The 27 drafted athletes with pre-existing rotator cuff tears played significantly fewer years (4.3 vs. 5.7, p=0.04) and significantly fewer games (47.1 vs. 68.4, p=0.04) than matched control athletes without rotator cuff tears (Table 1B). Additionally, these athletes started significantly fewer games (23.7 vs. 43.0, p=0.02) and had significantly worse performance scores (0.97 vs. 1.33, p=0.01) when compared to controls. When comparing those who had surgical intervention on their rotator cuff tears with those treated non-operatively, there were no statistically significant differences identified in outcome measures, including round drafted (3.7 vs. 4.8, p=0.17) and performance score (0.18 vs. 1.36, p=0.16) (Table 1C).
