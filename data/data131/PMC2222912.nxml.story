 oocytes as homomultimers of α subunits. The median open probability was 0.93 for cGMP, 0.47 for cIMP, and 0.01 for cAMP. The channels opened to a single conductance level of 26–30 pS at +80 mV. Using signal processing methods based on hidden Markov models, we determined that two closed and one open states are required to explain the gating at saturating ligand concentrations. We determined the maximum likelihood rate constants for two gating schemes containing two closed (denoted C) and one open (denoted O) states. For the C ↔ C ↔ O scheme, all rate constants were dependent on cyclic nucleotide. For the C ↔ O ↔ C scheme, the rate constants for only one of the transitions were cyclic nucleotide dependent. The opening rate constant was fastest for cGMP, intermediate for cIMP, and slowest for cAMP, while the closing rate constant was fastest for cAMP, intermediate for cIMP, and slowest for cGMP. We propose that interactions between the purine ring of the cyclic nucleotide and the binding domain are partially formed at the time of the transition state for the allosteric transition and serve to reduce the transition state energy and stabilize the activated conformation of the channel.
