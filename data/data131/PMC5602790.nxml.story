Between 2005 and 2013, 6.0% of participants lost more than 5% of their baseline weight; 38.5% were stable (<5% loss to 5% gain); 23.0% slightly gained weight (>5%–10%); 22.8% gained moderate weight (>10%–20%); and 9.4% had heavy weight gain (>20%). Moderate (>10%–20%) and heavy weight gain (>20%) were both associated with an increased risk of reporting ‘poor or very poor‘ overall health in 2013 among participants who had a normal body mass index (BMI) (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] 1.39; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.13–1.71 and AOR 1.44; 95% CI, 1.09–1.90, respectively), were overweight (AOR 1.53; 955 CI, 1.01–2.29 and AOR 1.82; 95% CI, 1.04–3.19, respectively) or had obesity (AOR 2.47; 95% CI, 1.74–3.51 and AOR 3.20; 95% CI, 2.00–5.16, respectively) in 2005. Weight gain of over 20% also had a negative impact on energy level among cohort members with a normal BMI in 2005 (AOR 1.36; 95% CI, 1.11–1.65) and among participants with obesity in 2005 (AOR 1.93; 95% CI, 1.38–2.71). For those who were underweight, had a normal BMI, or had obesity at baseline, weight loss of more than 5% was associated with reporting emotional problems. Excessive weight gain adversely impacted participants who were underweight or had obesity at baseline.
