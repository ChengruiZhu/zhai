Cells in a population are not all alike. The differences between cells impact how each cell responds to stimuli, with implications for development and disease. How do cells change between these functionally important states over time? This question is difficult to answer using molecular biology, because these methods destroy cells in order to observe them, preventing us from observing the same cell more than once. Cells in culture display a diverse set of motility behaviors that can be observed non-destructively over time. We have developed software to quantify these behaviors, and used this tool to identify cell motility states and quantify the changes in cell motility states over time. Using this approach, we identify that cancerous fibroblasts behave similarly to normal fibroblasts, but prefer some behaviors to others. This suggests cancerous transformation may lead to changes between states, rather than just creating new ones. Applying this analysis to muscle stem cells, we measure the rate of change from the stem cell to progenitor state for the first time. We are also able to determine if changes in behavior state are externally driven or random, demonstrating the utility of observing cell behaviors to study changes in cells over time.
