As the nervous system develops, an intricate web of connections forms between nerve cells, leading to the assembly of signalling networks that are capable of complex computations. However, the number and strength of connections formed between nerve cells varies. We ask how nerve cells deal with this variability so that the circuits they form are nicely matched to the functions they perform. Nerve cells are known to adjust their sensitivity to compensate for changes in the strengths of inputs they receive from other cells. In this study, we have identified a structural counterpart to this compensatory mechanism, and find that developing nerve cells respond to variation in the number of connections they receive by adjusting the size of their receiving structures (known as dendrites). Working with the same nerve cell in different embryos, we show that this cell reduces the size of its dendrites as the number of connections increases while allowing its dendrites to grow more extensively if inputs are reduced. These findings suggest that, at least during the early stages of wiring the nervous system, nerve cells regulate the growth of their dendrites, to compensate for variability and attain an optimal number of connections.
