The kidney is a complex organ that regulates blood homeostasis through the maintenance of fluid and ion balance and disposal of metabolic waste. We used zebrafish pronephros, a primordial vertebrate kidney, to address how a kidney tissue acquires its cell types and pattern. Two types of epithelial cells were found in the pronephric duct: multi-cilia cells and principal cells, which could be distinguished based on morphology and expression of different marker genes. In the pronephric duct, the multi-cilia cells and principal cells form a “salt and pepper,” or mosaic, pattern. Using existing zebrafish mutants and a knockdown technique, we demonstrated that the mosaic pattern and differentiation of these two cell types are controlled through a Notch-dependent lateral inhibition mechanism. Notch signaling has been shown to be essential for other aspects of kidney development, such as formation of the glomerulus and the tubule. Here, to our knowledge for the first time, we show that the same signaling pathway is required for the differentiation of two different epithelial cells in a kidney segment known as the distal pronephric duct. The same mechanism is very likely to be employed by other similar developmental processes in the same context to generate distinct cell types in a tissue.
