 A colchicine-binding assay and quantitative sodium dodecyl sulfate gel electrophoresis have been used to determine the changes which occur in microtubule protein (tubulin) concentrations in the particulate and soluble fractions of mouse oviduct homogenates during that period of development when centriole formation and cilium formation are at a maximum. When mouse oviducts, at various ages after birth, are homogenized in Tris-sucrose buffer, tubulin concentration is partitioned between the soluble (70%) and particulate (30%) fractions. During the period of most active organelle formation (3â€“12 days), there is a marked increase in colchicine-binding specific activity, in both the soluble and particulate fractions. Microtubule protein concentration increases from 16 to 24% in the soluble fraction, declining to 14% in the adult. In the particulate fractions, microtubule protein concentration increases from 16 to 27%, leveling off at 16% in the adult. We have concluded from these observations and from electron microscopy that colchicine-binding activity in the particulate fractions is related to the presence of centriole precursors in the pellets of homogenized oviducts from newborn mice. These data further suggest that centriole precursor structures are conveniently packaged aggregates of microtubule protein actively synthesized between 3 and 5 days, and maintained at a maximum during the most active period of organelle assembly.
