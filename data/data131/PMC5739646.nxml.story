/L, absence of central nervous system involvement, and high-risk cytogenetic abnormalities. Seventy-four patients (34.1%) expressed CD20 on ≥20% of leukemia blasts and were considered CD20 positive. We found that fewer CD20-positive than CD20-negative patients achieved durable first complete responses (CR1 ≥3 months) (81.1% vs. 94.9%, P=0.002). Within the standard-risk group, more CD20-negative than CD20-positive patients achieved CR (100% vs. 83.3%, P=0.003) and durable CR1 (100% vs. 82.4%, P=0.014). For patients in the CD20-negative standard-risk, CD20-positive standard-risk, CD20-negative high-risk, and CD20-positive high-risk groups, the 3-year cumulative incidence of relapse was 42.6%, 70.0%, 59.3%, and 69.5%, respectively (P=0.118); the 3-year disease-free survival rates were 52.1%, 0%, 20.7%, and 13.7%, respectively (P=0.006); and the 3-year overall survival rates were 55.8%, 13.8%, 23.6%, and 16.9%, respectively (P=0.006). Our results suggest that patients with CD20-negative standard-risk B cell precursor-ALL have favorable prognosis compared with CD20-positive standard-risk or CD20-negative or -positive high-risk patients. CD20-positive standard-risk ALL patients may need other therapeutic modalities bridging to allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation.
