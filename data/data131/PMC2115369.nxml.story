Cultured human fetal lung fibroblasts produce some chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans that are extracted as an aggregate in chaotropic buffers containing 4 M guanidinium chloride. The aggregated proteoglycans are excluded from Sepharose CL4B and 2B, but become included, eluting with a Kav value of 0.53 from Sepharose CL4B, when Triton X-100 is included in the buffer. Conversely, some of the detergent-extractable chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans can be incorporated into liposomes, suggesting the existence of a hydrophobic membrane-intercalated chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan fraction. Purified preparations of hydrophobic chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans contain two major core protein forms of 90 and 52 kD. A monoclonal antibody (F58-7D8) obtained from the fusion of myeloma cells with spleen cells of BALB/c mice that were immunized with hydrophobic proteoglycans recognized the 90- but not the 52-kD core protein. The epitope that is recognized by the antibody is exposed at the surface of cultured human lung fibroblasts and at the surface of several stromal cells in vivo, but also at the surface of Kupffer cells and of epidermal cells. The core proteins of these small membrane-associated chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans are probably distinct from those previously identified in human fibroblasts by biochemical, immunological, and molecular biological approaches.
