In the present study, knockdown of E2F1 impaired the migration and invasion of osteosarcoma cells. Further analysis showed that E2F1 knockdown decreased the expression of discoidin domain receptor 1 (DDR1) which plays a crucial role in many fundamental processes such as cell differentiation, adhesion, migration and invasion. Luciferase and ChIP assays confirmed that E2F1 silencing attenuated the expression of DDR1 through disrupting E2F1-mediated transcription of DDR1 in osteosarcoma cells. Similarly with the effect of E2F1 silencing, DDR1 knockdown weakened the migratory and invasive capabilities of osteosarcoma cells; while overexpression of DDR1 resulted in a significant increase of cell motility and invasiveness, even after knocking down E2F1. Interestingly, inactivation of E2F1/DDR1 pathway by shRNA weakened STAT3 signaling and subsequently suppressed the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) of osteosarcoma cells, as shown with decreased vimentin, MMP2, MMP9, and increased E-cadherin. Consistently, high expressions of E2F1 and DDR1 observed in osteosarcoma tissues were related to TNM stage and metastasis. In addition, high level of E2F1 or DDR1 was associated with poor prognosis in osteosarcoma patients. These results suggest that E2F1/DDR1/STAT3 pathway is critical for malignancy of osteosarcoma, which may provide a novel prognostic indicator or approach for osteosarcoma therapy.
