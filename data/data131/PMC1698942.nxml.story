In many fatal neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer, Parkinson, and spongiform encephalopathies, proteins aggregate into specific fibrous structures to form insoluble plaques known as amyloid. The amyloid structure may also play a nonaberrant role in different organisms. Many globular proteins, folding to their biologically functional native structures in vivo, can be induced to aggregate into amyloid-like fibrils under suitable conditions in vitro. One hallmark of amyloid structure is a specific supramolecular architecture called cross-beta structure, held together by hydrogen bonds extending repeatedly along the fibril axis, but intermolecular interactions are yet unknown at the amino-acid level except for very few cases. In this study, the authors present an algorithm, called prediction of amyloid structure aggregation (PASTA), to computationally predict which portions of a given protein or peptide sequence forming amyloid fibrils are stabilizing the corresponding cross-beta structure and the specific intermolecular pattern of hydrogen-bonded amino acids. PASTA is based on the assumption that the same amino acidâ€“specific interactions stabilizing hydrogen bond patterns in native structures of globular proteins are also employed by nature in amyloid structure. The successful comparison of the authors' prediction with available experimental data supports the existence of a unique framework to describe protein folding and aggregation.
