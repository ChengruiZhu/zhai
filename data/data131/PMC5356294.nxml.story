We included 41 children: 22 with HAE and 19 non-HAE. Of the HAE children, 14 were symptomatic—median age at onset was 4 [1–11] years. The first attack was peripheral in 8/14 children and abdominal in 6/14 children, i.e. no one had their first attacks in the upper airways. Most children had less than one attack per month. All of the symptomatic children had been treated with tranexamic acid and/or C1 inhibitor concentrate. Unlike in other countries, androgens were not used in our pediatric cohort. Home therapy with C1 inhibitor concentrate was established in 9 cases: 6 children were trained in self-administration and 3 children were treated by parents. Of the children, 10 had been diagnosed by symptoms, including 3 without family history—median age of diagnosis among these children was 5.35 [2–13.2] years. In 31 children, HAE was diagnosed or refuted before symptoms by blood samples. In 23 of these children, complement values were investigated, and in 9 cases genetic testing was added to the complement measurements. In 8 children recently investigated, genetic testing was first choice. Cord blood was used for complement measurements in 9 children and for genetic testing in 4 children. Results of complement measurements were equivocal in several cases, especially in the cord blood samples, and the sensitivity of low complement C4 for the diagnosis of HAE was 75%.
