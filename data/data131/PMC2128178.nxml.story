. The proteins of the blood serum, the mineral salts, and the dextrose in the medium may also have proved a source of food for the protozoa. 11. The products of bacterial metabolism, resulting from the growth of the bacteria, their fermentative activity, and their death may explain the rate of growth, reproduction, and death of the flagellates in the cultures. A certain amount of the products of decomposition together with the presence of the bacterial food supply may explain the rapid proliferation of the flagellates during the 1st day and the slower rate up to the 3rd or 4th day. An excess of these products may have inhibited the growth and multiplication of the protozoa, especially after the 3rd or 4th day, and ultimately may have brought about their death and disappearance from the cultures. 12. The initial alkalinity of the medium increased at the death of the culture. It is not believed that the change in alkalinity proved lethal to the protozoa. 13. Binary fission was often observed. The plane of division was median and longitudinal. A paradesmose was formed. 14. Multiple fission also occurred. The flagellate body, ameboid in movement, was a somatella comprised of four zooids. It contained four cytostomes, each with a cytostomal flagellum. The number of anterior flagella was not complete for each zooid. 15. Flagellates, joined in pairs, were often seen during the first 3 days in the cultures. They may represent conjugating forms, but as yet no evidence of the exchange of nuclear substance has been seen.
