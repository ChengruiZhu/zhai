A long-standing challenge in efforts to control human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) is the rapid evolution of the virus. Any effective therapy quickly gives rise to so-called escape mutants of the virus, potentially resulting in treatment failure. A distinct class of gene therapy based on conditionally replicating vectors has been suggested to have potential to circumvent the problem of viral evolutionary escape. A conditionally replicating vector cannot replicate on its own, but when it coinfects the same cell with HIV-1, it is packaged into a virion-like particle and can be transmitted from cell to cell. Importantly, these vectors replicate using the same machinery that HIV-1 uses, and so they mutate at the same rate. This opens the possibility that conditionally replicating vectors could ‘keep up’ with HIV-1 evolution and prevent HIV-1 escape. In this study, we present mathematical analyses of the co-evolutionary dynamics of HIV-1 and conditionally replicating vectors within a patient. Our results show that with proper genetic design, conditionally replicating vectors can keep pace with HIV-1 evolution, leading to persistent reduction in HIV-1 viral loads. Therefore, this class of gene therapies shows potential for ‘evolution-proof’ control of HIV-1, and merits further investigation in laboratory trials.
