In 39 patients (13.9%), appendectomy was performed along with 19 enucleated or endocoagulated ovarian cysts, 8 adhesiolyses, 6 transperitoneal hernioplasties (4 right and 2 left), 2 cholecystectomies, 2 excisions of a Meckel diverticulum, 1 aspiration and suture of a right tubal pregnancy and 1 electrodesiccation of pelvic endometriosis. Thirty-five patients (12.5%) revealed the presence of a gynecological-type pathology. We performed 2 (0.7%) conversions to open exploration and experienced 6 (2.1%) complications, of which only 1 (0.35%) was a major complication: a delayed hemoperitoneum (1 liter), re-operated elsewhere, the cause of which was not identified. We performed 4 (1.4%) relaparoscopies for retrocecal abscess (three patients with primary gangrenous appendicitis and peritonitis presenting with an abscess in the right iliac fossa and in one patient with widespread intestinal adhesions with primary acute appendicitis). No patient with a diagnosis of a normal appendix developed an intraperitoneal abscess. Mortality was non-existent. The postoperative course, which was subjectively better than in cases operated in the traditional way, was, on an average, 2 days (range 1-18 days) for appendectomies carried out with the traditional laparoscopic technique and 1 day for appendectomies carried out with the minilaparoscopic technique (6 patients).
