It is a great challenge to develop electrochemical sensors with superior sensitivity that concurrently possess high biocompatibility for monitoring at the single cell level. Herein we report a novel and reusable biomimetic micro-electrochemical sensor array with nitric oxide (NO) sensing-interface based on metalloporphyrin and 3-aminophenylboronic acid (APBA) co-functionalized reduced graphene oxide (rGO). The assembling of high specificity catalytic but semi-conductive metalloporphyrin with high electric conductive rGO confers the sensor with sub-nanomolar sensitivity. Further coupling with the small cell-adhesive molecule APBA obviously enhances the cytocompatibility of the microsensor without diminishing the sensitivity, while the reversible reactivity between APBA and cell membrane carbohydrates allows practical reusability. The microsensor was successfully used to sensitively monitor, in real-time, the release of NO molecules from human endothelial cells being cultured directly on the sensor. This demonstrates its potential application in the detection of NO with very low bioactive concentrations for the better understanding of its physiological function and for medical tracking of patient states.
