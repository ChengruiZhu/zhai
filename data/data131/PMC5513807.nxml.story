Bisphosphonates (BPs) suppress bone resorption and increase bone strength, thus reducing the risk of fracture. Oral BPs are widely used for the prevention and treatment of osteoporosis and osteopenia. Here, we describe the case of a postmenopausal woman who took oral alendronate for >3 years for osteoporosis. The patient presented at the clinic with sharp jaw pain and swelling on the left mandible 4 months after extraction of the third molar. Clinical examinations identified an inflamed mucosal opening with pus over an area of necrotic bone. Initial images of cone beam computed tomography revealed a sequestrum at the extracted socket. The condition did not improve after 1 week of antibiotic treatment; therefore, the alendronate treatment was terminated and the patient was prescribed strontium ranelate instead. The patient gradually recovered and, at the 2-year follow-up, the site of BP-related osteonecrosis of the jaw healed completely as determined by both clinical and cone beam computed tomography measures. The bone mineral densities in the femoral neck and lumbar spine improved after 1 year, and were maintained at the 3-year follow-up. The serum C-terminal cross-linking telopeptide values also gradually increased from the initial 130 pg/mL to 320 pg/mL at the 3-year follow-up. Taken together, this case supports the use of strontium ranelate as an alternative treatment for postmenopausal women who receive long-term oral BP treatments and are at risk for serious complications of BP-related osteonecrosis of the jaw.
