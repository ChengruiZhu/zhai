 demonstrated only when the phosphonate ester is present during the chemotactic response. Differences were found in these two modes of inhibition caused by various phosphonates, in terms of their time course of inhibition, in the dose response curves, and in the structure-activity relationships. It has been conclusively demonstrated that the phosphonate esters have no direct inhibitory effect on the chemotactic factor. This has been shown by retention of activity of the chemotactic factor following incubation with phosphonate esters and subsequent removal by dialysis. In addition, the activity of the chemotactic factor and its physical-chemical characteristics in density gradient ultracentrifugation were unaltered in the continued presence of a potent phosphonate inhibitor of chemotaxis. The uptake of the dye trypan blue was studied in cells treated with phosphonate in such a manner to induce cell-dependent inhibition of chemotaxis. Even when 84% cell-dependent inhibition of chemotaxis occurred, no uptake of the dye by leukocytes was found. Thus, phosphonate-induced inhibition of cell responsiveness in chemotaxis was not associated with generalized cell damage as defined by exclusion of the dye. It is concluded that
