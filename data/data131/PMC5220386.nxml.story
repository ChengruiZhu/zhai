The present study was conducted to ascertain the shape, size, presence of accessory foramina, direction, and the precise position of the infraorbital foramen (IOF) in relation to the inferior orbital margin (IOM), anterior nasal spine (ANS), nasion (Na), maxillary teeth, and supraorbital foramen/notch (SOF/N) in adult skulls in a Sri Lankan population. Fifty-four skulls (42 males and 12 females) were analyzed. The IOF was oval in shape (38.6% and 36.3% on the right and left side, resp.) in a majority of skulls. The direction of the IOF was mostly medially downward (48.6%). Accessory foramina were found in 7.4% of the skulls. The infraorbital foramina were located at a mean distance of 6.52 ± 2.03 mm and 7.30 ± 1.57 mm, vertically below the IOM on the right and left side, respectively; 33.81 ± 2.68 mm and 34.23 ± 2.56 mm from the ANS on the right and left side, respectively; and 42.37 ± 3.52 mm and 42.52 ± 3.28 mm from the Na on the right and left side, respectively. In relation to the upper teeth the majority of IOF (37.5% and 55.9% on the right and left side, resp.) were located in the same vertical axis as the tip of the buccal cusp of the maxillary second premolar tooth.
