Selective laser trabeculoplasty (SLT) has been widely used in the clinical management of glaucoma, both as primary and adjunctive treatment. As new evidence continues to arise, we review the current literature in terms of indications and efficacy, surgical technique, postoperative care, repeatability, and complications of this therapy. SLT has been shown to be effective in various glaucomas, including primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG), normal-tension glaucoma (NTG), steroid-induced glaucoma, pseudoexfoliation glaucoma (PXFG), and primary angle-closure glaucoma (PACG), as well as other glaucoma subtypes. Relatively high preoperative intraocular pressure (IOP) may predict surgical success, while other parameters that have been studied do not seem to affect the outcome. Different techniques for performing the procedure have recently been explored, revealing that minor modifications may lead to a more favorable or safer clinical outcome. The utilization of postoperative medications remains controversial based on the current evidence. A short-term IOP increase may complicate SLT and can also persist in certain cases such as in exfoliation glaucoma. The efficacy and safety of repeat SLT are shown in multiple studies, and the timing of repeat procedures may affect the success rate.
