-terminal amino acid sequence analysis identified the 17-kD protein as nuclear core histone H3. Both phosphotyrosine and phosphoserine-specific monoclonal antibodies reacted with the 17-kD protein by Western blot, suggesting that the binding of SDH to these pharyngeal cells elicits a novel signaling pathway that ultimately leads to activation of histone H3â€“specific kinases. Genistein-inhibitable phosphorylation of histone H3 indicates that tyrosine kinase plays a key role in this event. Treatment of pharyngeal cells with protein kinase inhibitors such as genistein and staurosporine significantly inhibited streptococcal invasion of pharyngeal cells. Therefore, these data indicated that streptococci/SDH-mediated phosphorylation plays a critical role in bacterial entry into the host cell. To identify the membrane receptor that elicits these signaling events, we found that SDH bound specifically to 30- and 32-kD membrane proteins in a direct ligand-binding assay. These findings clearly suggest that SDH plays an important role in cellular communication between streptococci and pharyngeal cells that may be important in host cell gene transcription, and hence in the pathogenesis of streptococcal infection.
