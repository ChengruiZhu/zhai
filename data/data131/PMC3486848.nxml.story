Indefinite growth of tumor cells requires a mechanism to maintain telomeres. While most cancers use telomerase for this, some maintain long and heterogeneous telomeres using a recombination-dependent mechanism termed alternative lengthening of telomeres (ALT). What causes ALT and how their long and heterogeneous telomeres form and are maintained are not well understood. In this study, we use mutationally tagged telomeric repeats to probe the mechanisms by which highly elongated telomeres are generated by recombination in an ALTâ€“like yeast mutant. Our data show that most or all lengthened telomeres in a newly established mutant cell are commonly generated by amplifying sequence from a single telomere source. This is consistent with the roll-and-spread model, which proposes that a single circle of telomeric DNA can be the ultimate source of all newly amplified telomeres. Other evidence showed that the telomeres of the mutant are exceptionally dynamic. Rapid terminal deletions preceded telomere elongation at the establishment of the mutant state. Also, patterns of telomeric repeats present in long telomeres became rapidly scrambled. These findings may have implications for the establishment and maintenance of long telomeres in human ALT cells.
