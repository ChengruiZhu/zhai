Elemental carbon (EC) and organic carbon (OC) concentrations were measured in PM2.5 and PM10 samples collected at Diabla Gora (Puszcza Borecka National Nature Reserve, Poland) between 1 January and 31 December 2009, to investigate the seasonal and daily concentration variations and source regions. Strict sampling and measurement procedure, together with analysis of air mass backward trajectories and pollutant markers, indicated that the most important sources of carbon in the aerosols over Diabla Gora were vegetation, agricultural activity, and biomass burning. The highest contribution of secondary organic carbon (SOC) in aerosol mass (70 %) was detected during summer as a result of increased vegetation. In spring and autumn, raised concentrations of primary OC, calcium, and potassium and the presence of ammonium nitrate were observed in aerosols due to emission from surrounding fields and forests, as well as from fires in Lithuania. Anthropogenic influence on the increase in concentration of all carbon species was observed only in winter, when air masses drifted in from habitations situated within a radius of 50 km from the Diabla Gora station. Transport was of sporadic significance to the measured concentrations, and only in PM2.5 when wind speed was close to 1 m s
