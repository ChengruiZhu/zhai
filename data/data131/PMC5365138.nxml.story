Where a geneâ€™s regulatory site is disrupted by a genetic variant, its expression levels will vary between individuals depending on the version of the variant they carry. Such genetic loci, termed eQTLs, have been found to be disproportionately associated with disease and have proven to be a powerful tool for identifying the location of regulatory variation in the human genome. Despite the widespread study of eQTLs, the focus has, to date, largely been on the effect of individual variants on individual genes. The extent to which individual variants are linked to the expression of multiple nearby genes (suggestive of such variants tagging shared regulatory sites) is largely unknown. By first removing redundancy among eQTLs and then examining their effects across tissues and how they relate to how the genome folds, we show that cis-eQTL sharing is a relatively common phenomenon. We show that these master-eQTLs are not only linked to the way in which the human genome has evolved, but are also relevant to the understanding of the co-occurrence of diseases in individuals. These variants are more often linked to multiple diseases and phenotypes, which suggests that these locations are key hubs for understanding human disease risk.
