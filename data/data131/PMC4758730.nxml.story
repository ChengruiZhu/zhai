Epigenetic mechanisms regulate when, where, and how an organism uses the genetic information stored in its genome. They are essential to many cellular processes, such as the regulation of gene expression, genome organization, and cell-fate determination. They also govern growth, development, and ultimately human health. Heterochromatin constitutes silenced chromatic domains, in which gene silencing occurs through epigenetic mechanisms. RNA processing pathways, such as RNA interference (RNAi) and the exosome, are known to mediate the silencing of genes via degradation of unwanted or aberrant transcripts. In this study, we describe a new RNA processing mechanism in epigenetic silencing using fission yeast, a premier model for studying these processes. With genetic, cell biology, and genomic approaches, we uncovered a previously unrecognized function of Dhp1, a highly conserved 5’-3’ exoribonuclease and ortholog of budding yeast Rat1 and metazoan Xrn2. We show that Dhp1 mediates a novel RNA processing mechanism in epigenetic silencing which occurs independently of both RNAi and the exosome. Our results clarify how multiple RNA processing pathways are involved in the regulation of eukaryotic gene expression and chromatin organization.
