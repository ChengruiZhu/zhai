Decision making is partly random: a person can make different decisions at different times based on the same information. The theory of probability matching says that one reason for this randomness is that people usually choose the response that they think is most likely to be correct, but they sometimes intentionally choose the response that they think is less likely to be correct. Probability matching is a theory that was developed to describe how people try to predict the outcome of a partly random event, e.g., whether a patient has some medical condition, given the result of a medical test that does not provide perfectly accurate information. Recently, modified probability matching theories have been used to understand perceptual decision making, e.g., judging whether a sound and a visual flash were produced by the same event or by different events. We show that probability matching predicts that peoplesâ€™ perceptual decisions on difficult tasks are highly random and make poor use of the available information. We show experimentally that expert perceptual decisions are less random and more efficient than probability matching predicts. These findings help us understand how people perform a wide range of important real-world perceptual tasks, such as evaluating medical images and detecting targets in airport screening scans.
