 of the two compounds in radiation-injured mouse, when compared with normal mouse. In order to investigate the intrinsic mechanism of AS on radiation injury, AS extract’s protective effects on brain, the main part of mouse that suffered from radiation, were explored. The function of AS extract in repressing expression changes of radiation response proteins in prefrontal cortex (PFC) of mouse brain included tubulin protein family (α-, β-tubulin subunits), dihydropyrimidinase-related protein 2 (CRMP2), γ-actin, 14-3-3 protein family (14-3-3ζ, ε), heat shock protein 90β (HSP90β), and enolase 2. The results demonstrated the AS extract had positive effects on nerve cells’ structure, adhesion, locomotion, fission, and phagocytosis, through regulating various action pathways, such as Hippo, phagosome, PI3K/Akt (phosphatidylinositol 3 kinase/protein kinase B), Neurotrophin, Rap1 (Ras-related protein RAP-1A), gap junction glycolysis/gluconeogenesis, and HIF-1 (Hypoxia-inducible factor 1) signaling pathways to maintain normal mouse neurological activity. All of the results indicated that AS may be a promising alternative medicine for the treatment of radiation injury in mouse brain. It would be tested that whether the bioactive ingredients of AS could be effective through the blood–brain barrier in the future.
