Although inhibitors of epigenetic regulators have been effective in the treatment of cutaneous T cell lymphoma (CTCL) and other hematopoietic malignancies, they have been less effective in solid tumors, including ovarian cancer (OC). We have previously shown that inhibition of histone deacetylase (HDAC) activity induces expression of the pro-inflammatory and pro-angiogenic chemokine interleukin-8 (CXCL8, IL-8) in OC cells, resulting in their increased survival and proliferation. Here, we show that in addition to ovarian cancer SKOV3, OVCAR3, and CAOV3 cells, HDAC inhibition induces the CXCL8 expression in HeLa cells, but not in CTCL Hut-78 cells. In OC cells, the CXCL8 expression is induced by pharmacological inhibition of class I HDACs. Interestingly, while an individual suppression of HDAC1, HDAC2, or HDAC3 by corresponding siRNAs inhibits the CXCL8 expression, their simultaneous suppression induces the CXCL8 expression. The induced CXCL8 expression in OC cells is dependent on histone acetyltransferase (HAT) activity of CREB-binding protein (CBP), but not p300, and is associated with HAT-dependent p65 recruitment to CXCL8 promoter. Together, our results show that the CXCL8 expression in OC cells is induced by combined inhibition of HDAC1, -2, and -3, and silenced by suppression of HAT activity of CBP. In addition, our data indicate that the induced CXCL8 expression may be responsible for the limited effectiveness of HDAC inhibitors in OC and perhaps other solid cancers characterized by CXCL8 overexpression, and suggest that targeting class I HDACs and CBP may provide novel combination strategies by limiting the induced CXCL8 expression.
