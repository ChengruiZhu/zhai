To extract important details about objects in the environment, people must focus their attention on a specific location in space at any given moment. Research using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) has suggested that regions of the frontal and parietal lobes work together to control our ability to direct attention to a specific location in space in preparation for an expected visual object. However, the sluggishness of the hemodynamic response has made it difficult to obtain information from fMRI about the timing of activity. Electroencephalography (EEG) has provided information about the timing of neural activity, but the limitations of traditional source estimation techniques have made it difficult to obtain information about the precise location in the brain that the EEG signals are coming from. Thus, the sequence of activities within this frontal-parietal network remains unclear. We used a recently developed electrical neuroimaging technique—called beamforming—to localize the neural generators of low-frequency electroencephalographic (EEG) signals, which enabled us to determine both the location and temporal sequence of activations in the brain during shifts of visuospatial attention. Our results indicate that low-frequency signals in parietal cortex provide the initial signal to shift attention.
