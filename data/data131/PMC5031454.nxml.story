Most complex nervous systems have an anterior-posterior axis of symmetry: the midline of the central nervous system. Longitudinal nerves, formed by bundled axons, connect the brain to other parts of the body and grow long distances parallel to the central nervous system midline. In the fruit fly, the nerve cord is segmented, and the boundary of each segment represents a challenge for the longitudinal axons to cross. What cues promote growth of axons across these boundaries remains unknown. The Slit protein is classically known as a repulsive signal that prevents axons from crossing the midline by binding to its receptor Robo on the surface of axons. However, it is known that Slit is cleaved into two fragments, but the significance of this process remains to be elucidated. In this study, we find that cleavage of Slit allows the large fragment (Slit-N) to bind to another receptor called Dscam1, which then forms a complex with Robo1. Our experiments confirm that Slit processing is required for the longitudinal growth of axons across the segment boundary. Our work suggests that the Slit-N-Dscam1-Robo1 complex signals axons to grow, but Slit-N is not a specific navigational cue. Dscam proteins have evolutionarily conserved ligand-binding activities; therefore, they may be able to alter the signaling output of other receptors. The Slit fragments play diverse roles, from tumor metastasis to HIV replication; thus, identifying a receptor that is specific for Slit-N provides a molecular explanation for why cleavage occurs.
