Reward cues are potent triggers of desires, ranging from normal appetites to compulsive addictions. Food cues may trigger a sudden desire to eat before lunch, and drug cues may trigger even a ‘recovered addict’ to relapse again into drug taking. But learned cues are not constant in their motivating power. Food cues are more potent when you are hungry, and drug cues may become overwhelmingly potent to an addict who tries to take ‘just one’ drink or hit, precipitating an escalating binge of further relapse. These changes in cue-triggered desire produced by a change in biological state present a challenge to many current computational models of motivation. Such modulation can even be unlearned (though the modulation interacts with cues acquired through learning), in that the modulation instantly follows a physiological or neurobiological change (hunger, drug hit, etc.), altering the cue's ability to trigger desire for a relevant reward. Here we demonstrate concrete examples of instant modulation and propose how to build computational models of cue-triggered ‘wanting’ to better capture the dynamic interaction between learning and physiology that controls the incentive salience mechanism of motivation for rewards.
