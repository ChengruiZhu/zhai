Dendritic cell-specific intercellular adhesion molecule-3-grabbing nonintegrin-related protein (DC-SIGNR) is a type II transmembrane protein that has been reported to bind to various pathogens and participate in immunoregulation and tumorigenesis. However, further research is required to investigate whether the level of DC-SIGNR and cervical cancer are associated. The present study aimed to explore the clinical diagnostic significance of DC-SIGNR in cervical cancer. Immunohistochemical staining of DC-SIGNR was performed in samples from 25 patients with early stage cervical cancer, 14 patients with cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) and cervical polyp samples from 15 individuals. DC-SIGNR expression in cervical cancer tissue was significantly higher compared with that in CIN and cervical polyp tissue (P=0.0184 and P=0.0236, respectively). However, there was no significant difference in DC-SIGNR expression between CIN and cervical polyp tissue (P=0.8103). Additionally, the serum DC-SIGNR levels in 84 cervical cancer patients and 69 healthy female individuals were measured using an ELISA. Serum (s)DC-SIGNR levels were significantly higher in cervical cancer patients compared with healthy female individuals (P<0.0001). A sDC-SIGNR level of 93.7 ng/ml was revealed by receiver operating characteristic curve analysis to predict the presence of cervical cancer with 69.57% sensitivity and 66.67% specificity (area under the curve, 0.6989; P<0.0001). Levels of sDC-SIGNR in cervical cancer patients were also correlated with serum levels of squamous cell carcinoma antigen (r=0.2583; P=0.0348). The results of the present study demonstrate that DC-SIGNR is overexpressed in cervical cancer tissue, and suggest that DC-SIGNR could serve as a biomarker for the early diagnosis of cervical cancer. Nevertheless, further studies are required to demonstrate what role DC-SIGNR serves in cervical cancer.
