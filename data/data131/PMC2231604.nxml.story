Among 374 patients included in our study (mean age 34.46±25.68; 146 males), 192 developed new  conduction disorders: symptomatic sinus bradycardia in 8%, atrial fibrillation with slow ventricular response (AF) in 4.5%, first-degree atrioventricular block (AVB)in 6.4%, second-degree AVB in 0.3%, third-degree AVB in 7%, new right bundle branch block (RBBB) in 33%, and new left bundle branch block (LBBB) in 2.1%. In 5.6% patients, a permanent pacemaker was implanted, 47.6% of them underwent valvular surgery. In 44.1% of patients the conduction defects occurred in the first 48 hr. after surgery. In CABG group, 29.7% of patients developed new conduction disturbances; the most common of them was symptomatic sinus bradycardia. After valvular surgery 44.2% of patients developed conduction disturbances, of those the most common was  atrial fibrillation with slow ventricular response . After VSD and TOF repair, the most common conduction disturbance was new RBBB. Perioperative myocardial infarction (MI) occurred in  1.9% of  patients. The occurrence conduction disturbance was compared with patient age, sex, occurrence of perioperative MI, ejection fraction (EF), postoperative use of ß-adernergic receptor blocking agents and digitalis and type of cardiac surgery. By regression analysis there was a correlation between type of surgery and new conduction defects, being significant for CABG and TOF repair. Only the occurrence of perioperative MI was related to PPM implantation.
