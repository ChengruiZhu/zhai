NT-proBNP, C-reactive protein (CRP) and diastolic function were assessed in 217 patients with MFS (31 ± 16 y, 110 f. and in 339 patients referred for suspected MFS in whom the diagnosis was ruled out according to the Ghent nosology (30 ± 15 y, 154 f). Assessment of cardiovascular remodeling, diastolic function in echocardiography, and NT-proBNP was analyzed with univariate analysis and multi-parameter analysis of covariance (MANCOVA). NT-proBNP was 70.6 ± 74.8 pg/ml in patients with Marfan syndrome and 58.4 ± 100.3 pg/ml in controls (p = 0.002, Kolmogorov–Smirnov). There were significant intergroup differences regarding end-diastolic left ventricular volume (p < 0.001), and aortic diameter (p < 0.001). The ratio of early diastolic mitral flow velocity (E) to early relaxation velocity in tissue Doppler (e′), E/e′ (p < 0.001) was significantly higher in patients with Marfan syndrome than in controls, whereas e′ (p < 0.001) and the ratio of E to inflow velocity during atrial contraction (A), E/A (p = 0.012) was significantly lower. Besides age and gender, diagnosis of MFS, diastolic function (e′ and E/e′), Z-Score of aortic diameter, and left ventricular size were identified as significant independent parameters with impact on NT-proBNP levels.
