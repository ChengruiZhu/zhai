Certain genomic regions code for multiple, overlapping functionalities that can be detected by analyzing the levels and patterns of their evolutionary conservation. The redundant nature of the genetic code facilitates the appearance of such multi-functional gene regions through evolution. At many of these sites the DNA sequence encodes a protein segment and in parallel to that another function, e.g. regulatory sites involved in translation initiation and transcript splicing. However, it has never been studied how the corresponding protein segments can tolerate that their primary sequences, and consequently their structures, are restricted by the sequences of the overlapping functionalities. To answer this question, we analyzed a recently published, large set of human, potentially multi-functional coding regions for the structural properties of encoded proteins with a variety of computational structure prediction tools. We examined the level of disorder, secondary structure, and sequence complexity of the corresponding protein regions, and found that multi-functional gene regions translate into protein segments that are significantly enriched in structurally disordered and compositionally biased regions, while they are depleted in secondary structure and domain annotations compared to reference segments of similar lengths. This tendency suggests that protein structural disorder provides evolutionary advantage when accommodating multiple overlapping functions in coding regions.
