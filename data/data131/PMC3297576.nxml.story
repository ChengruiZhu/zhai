Pancreatic beta cells are destroyed by the immune system in type 1 diabetes mellitus, causing insulin dependence for life. Candidate genes for diabetes contribute to this process by acting both at the immune system and, as we suggest here, at the pancreatic beta cell level. We have utilized a novel technology, RNA sequencing, to define all transcripts expressed in human pancreatic islets under basal conditions and following exposure to cytokines, pro-inflammatory mediators that contribute to trigger diabetes. Our observations double the number of known genes present in human islets and indicate that >60% of the candidate genes for type 1 diabetes are expressed in beta cells. The data also show that pro-inflammatory cytokines modify alternative splicing in human islets, a process that may generate novel RNAs and proteins recognizable by the immune system. This, taken together with the findings that pancreatic beta cells themselves express and release many cytokines and chemokines (proteins that attract immune cells), indicates that early type 1 diabetes is characterized by a dialog between beta cells and the immune system. We suggest that candidate genes for diabetes function at least in part as “writers” for the beta cell words in this dialog.
