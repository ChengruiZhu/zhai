During mitosis, the separation of duplicated chromosomes and subsequent cytokinesis (cell division) are tightly coupled processes. Cytokinesis must occur not only after chromosomes have separated but also in the physical space between the chromosomes, so that each daughter cell inherits the appropriate genetic material. The mechanisms responsible for this cellular choreography are poorly understood, however. We used chemical genetics to dissect the role of a key regulator of cell division, Polo-like kinase 1 (Plk1) in human cells. We show that, contrary to previous models, the ability of Plk1 to seek out microtubules that lie between the separated chromosomes (so-called midzone microtubules) provides the cell with an affirmative command to divide. Once assembled at this landmark, Plk1 phosphorylates HsCYK-4, a component of the centralspindlin complex (so named because it assembles at the spindle midzone) and enables binding between HsCYK-4 and Ect2, another regulator of cell division. Bound Ect2 then communicates with the machinery that assembles the actin- and myosin-based contractile ring, leading to division of the cell into two daughters. Our work therefore reveals new insights into how Plk1 temporally and spatially orchestrates division of human cells.
