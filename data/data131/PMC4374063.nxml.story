Actinic keratosis (AK) is a common skin condition caused by long-term sun exposure that has the potential to progress to non-melanoma skin cancers. The objective of this review is to examine the therapeutic options and management of AK globally, particularly in Australia, Canada, and the United Kingdom. Despite its potentially malignant nature, general awareness of AK is low, both in the general population and in the primary health care setting, especially in countries with low incidence. There is no standard therapeutic strategy for AK; it is treated through a variety of lesion-directed or field-directed therapies or a combination of both. A variety of treatment options are used depending on the experience of the primary care physician, the pathology of the lesion, and patient factors. Studies have shown that the physicians do not always use the optimal treatment option because of a lack of knowledge. The higher incidence of AK in fair-skinned people in Australia has resulted in well-established management strategies and guidelines for its treatment, compared with countries with lower incidence. It is essential to raise the awareness of AK because of its potential to progress to invasive squamous cell carcinoma. Primary care physicians are often the first to see this condition in their patients and are perfectly placed to educate the public and raise awareness. It is therefore desirable that their education and knowledge about AK and its treatment are up to date.
