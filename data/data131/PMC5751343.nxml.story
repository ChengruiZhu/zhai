 is an oriental medicine used for asthma and bronchitis. We investigated its mechanism of action, its inhibitory effects on lipopolysaccharide-induced inflammation in macrophages, and its impact on viability in a cecal ligation and puncture (CLP)-induced mouse model of sepsis. Tussilagone suppressed the expression of the inflammatory mediators, nitric oxide and prostaglandin E2, and the inflammatory cytokines, tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) and high-mobility group box 1 (HMGB1), in lipopolysaccharide-stimulated RAW 264.7 cells and peritoneal macrophages. Tussilagone also reduced the activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinases and nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF-κB) involved in the activation of various inflammatory mediators in activated macrophages. Moreover, tussilagone administration (1 mg/kg and 10 mg/kg) produced decreased mortality and lung injury in CLP-activated septic mice. Augmented expression of cyclooxygenase (COX)-2 and TNF-α in pulmonary alveolar macrophages of septic mice were attenuated by tussilagone administration. Tussilagone also suppressed the induction of nitric oxide, prostaglandin E2, TNF-α and HMGB1 in the serum of the septic mice. Overall, tussilagone exhibited protective effects against inflammation and polymicrobial sepsis by suppressing inflammatory mediators possibly via the inhibition of NF-κB activation and the MAP kinase pathway. These results suggest the possible use of tussilagone for developing novel therapeutic modalities for sepsis and other inflammatory diseases.
