TGF-β family proteins control cell differentiation and various cell functions. Increased TGF-β signaling, acting through heteromeric receptor complexes, contributes to carcinoma progression and fibrosis. TGF-β drives epithelial–mesenchymal transdifferentiation (EMT), which enables cell migration and invasion. Upon TGF-β binding, “type I” receptors activate, through phosphorylation, Smad2 and Smad3 that control target gene transcription. In EMT, Smad complexes activate the expression of EMT “master” transcription factors and cooperate with these to repress the epithelial phenotype and activate mesenchymal gene expression. TGF-β receptors also activate Erk MAPK signaling, involving association of the adaptor protein ShcA and Tyr phosphorylation of ShcA by type I receptors. We now show that the predominant ShcA isoform, p52ShcA, competes with Smad2/3 for binding to type I TGF-β receptors, thus repressing Smad2/3 activation in response to TGF-β and localizing the receptors to caveolar compartments. Consequently, decreased ShcA expression enhanced TGF-β receptor localization in clathrin compartments and autocrine Smad2/3 signaling, repressed the epithelial phenotype, and promoted EMT. The changes following decreased ShcA expression resulted in increased cell migration and invasion, as well as increased stem cell generation, dependent upon autocrine TGF-β signaling. These findings position ShcA as a determinant of the epithelial phenotype by repressing TGF-β-induced Smad activation through differential partitioning of receptor complexes at the cell surface.
