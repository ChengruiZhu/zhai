The intercalated disc is an indispensable structure that connects neighboring cardiomyocytes. It is also considered to be a single functional unit for cellular electric, mechanical, and signaling communication to maintain cardiomyocyte rigidity and synchrony. Mutation or defect in intercalated disc components usually results in distortions in the structure of intercalated discs and lethal cardiac abnormalities in patients. In this study, we found that the dynamic expression and subcellular location of HSPB7 are highly associated with intercalated disc component protein, N-cadherin, during the assembly and maturation of intercalated discs in cardiomyocytes. To identify the functional role of HSPB7 in the adult heart, we conducted a loss-of-function study of HSPB7 using a gene conditional knockout approach. We found that the loss of HSPB7 quickly results in the disruption of the intercalated disc structure, decreasing the expression of connexin 43 and mislocalization of N-cadherin and desmoplakin, and further inducing arrhythmic sudden death. In conclusion, our mouse model demonstrates that HSPB7 is required to maintain the structure and function of gap-junction complexes and intercalated discs, which has important implications for human heart disease.
