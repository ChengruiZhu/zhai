There is a growing consensus that neuronal oscillations constitute a fundamental computational mechanism in the brain. Beyond this, recent experimental evidence has highlighted interactions between oscillations at high and low frequencies (e.g. gamma oscillations, 40–80 Hz, are modulated by theta oscillations, 4–10 Hz), and two major theories have developed regarding the functional role of this kind of cross-frequency coupling. Here, we present a computational modelling study of these theories with strong implications for biological studies. Firstly, we demonstrate for the first time that each of these theories is physiologically plausible, in that they can be implemented in a spiking network model with parameters guided by experimental data. Secondly, we show that they are each computationally useful, able to overcome a feature-binding ambiguity in a presented stimulus. Finally, we implement both theories within a single network model, and find that only a single parameter change is required to switch between the two processing states. This leads to the exciting new proposal that both theories may be correct, both implemented in the brain, with dynamic switching between modes according to processing and attentional requirements.
