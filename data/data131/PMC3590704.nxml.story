Roughly a quarter of all clavicle fractures occur at the lateral end. Displaced fractures of the lateral clavicle have a higher rate of nonunion. The management of fractures of the lateral clavicle remains controversial. Open reduction internal fixation with a superiorly placed locking plate is a recently developed technique. However, there are no randomized controlled trials to evaluate the efficacy of this procedure. We present a series of four cases which highlight the technical drawbacks with this method of fixation for lateral clavicle fractures. Two cases show that failure of the plate to negate the displacing forces at the fracture site can lead to plate pullout. Two cases illustrate an unusual complication of an iatrogenic injury to the acromioclavicular joint capsule which led to joint instability and dislocation. We advise caution in using this method of fixation. Recent studies have described the success of lateral clavicle locking plate fixation augmented with a coracoclavicular sling. This augmentation accounts for the displacing forces at the fracture site. We would recommend that when performing lateral clavicle locking plate fixation, it should be reinforced with a coracoclavicular sling to prevent plate failure by lateral screw pullout.
