A high-performance liquid chromatographic (HPLC) method has been developed for the separation and determination of S- and R-enantiomers of betaxolol in tablets and ophthalmic preparations. Baseline resolution was achieved by using teicoplanin macrocyclic antibiotic chiral stationary phase (CSP) known as Chirobiotic T with fluorescence detection at excitation/emission wavelengths 275/305 nm. The polar ionic mobile phase (PIM) consists of methanol-glacial acetic acid-triethylamine, (100:0.020:0.025, v/v/v) has been used at a flow rate of 1.5 ml/min. All analytes with S-(–)-atenolol as internal standard were conducted at ambient temperature. The method is highly specific where another coformulated compounds did not interfere. The stability of betaxolol enantiomers under different degree of temperature also studied. The results showed that it is stable for at least 7 days at 70°C. The method validated for its linearity, accuracy, precision and robustness. Experimental design was used during validation to evaluate method robustness. Using the chromatographic conditions described, S- and R-betaxolol were well resolved with mean retention times of 11.3 and 12.6 min, respectively. Linear response (r > 0.997) was observed over the range of 10–500 ng/ml of betaxolol enantiomers, with detection limit of 5 ng/ml. The recoveries of S- and R-betaxolol from tablets and ophthalmic preparation ranged from 97.4 to 101.4% and 98.0 to 102.0%, respectively. The mean relative standard deviation (R.S.D.%) for both enantiomers were 1.1–1.4% and 1.3–1.7% in tablets and ophthalmic solution, respectively.
