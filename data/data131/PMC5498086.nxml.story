This study was conducted to investigate cancer centers established for the purpose of satisfying various needs about cancer, improving the cancer treatment environment, and subdividing services ranging from diagnosis, treatment, and rehabilitation to palliative care. To this end, the authors have surveyed programs in 17 cancer centers representing Korea, including 12 national cancer centers and five major hospitals. As a result, it was found that the most common type of lecture program was disease management, followed by health care and hospitalization, while the most common type of participation program was psychological relief, followed by physical activity. The most frequently operated type of program was found to be psychological relief, followed by physical activity and health care in the regional cancer centers, while the most frequently operated type was disease management, followed by psychological relief and health care in the five major hospitals. The proportion of physical activity was very high in two regional cancer centers, whereas five regional cancer centers did not offer physical activity programs at all. In the five major hospitals, physical activity programs were conducted regularly at least once a month or at least once a week. In addition, further studies are required to provide professional and detailed medical services for the establishment and operation of programs for cancer patient management and the environmental aspects of the hospital.
