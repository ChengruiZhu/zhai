The mammalian epidermis is a stratified self-renewing epithelium, in which cell loss at the surface is properly balanced by cell proliferation in basal layers to ensure tissue homeostasis. But how is this balance genetically controlled? Here, we address this question in zebrafish breeding tubercles, epidermal appendages in which keratinocytes undergo more advanced differentiation processes than in regular fish epidermis, sharing crucial features with the cornified mammalian skin. We identify a linear pathway consisting of the transcription factor p53 and its close relative TAp63, which activate Notch signalling and thereby caspase 3 to promote terminal differentiation and eventual shedding of keratinocytes in upper tubercle layers, while at the same time employing non-cell autonomous mechanisms to promote keratinocyte proliferation at the tubercle base, thereby ensuring proper development and homeostasis of this self-renewing tissue. Such a two-fold function of the pathway is consistent with the formerly reported dual role of a caspase during wing regeneration in the fruitfly. Our findings will help to better understand the seemingly contrary effects described for TAp63 in different mammalian systems, while demonstrating partial functional redundancy between p53 and TAp63 during epidermal development in fish.
