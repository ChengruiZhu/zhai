Cell proliferation involves DNA replication followed by a mitotic division, producing two cells with identical genomes. Diploid organisms, which contain two genome copies per cell, also undergo meiosis, where DNA replication followed by two divisions produces haploid gametes, the equivalent sperm and eggs, with a single copy of the genome. During meiosis, the two copies of each chromosome are brought together and connected by recombination intermediates (joint molecules, JMs) at sites of sequence identity. During meiosis, JMs frequently resolve as crossovers, which exchange flanking sequences, and crossovers are required for accurate chromosome segregation. JMs also form during the mitotic cell cycle, but resolve infrequently as crossovers. To understand how JMs resolve during the mitotic cell cycle, we used a property of budding yeast, return to growth (RTG), in which cells exit meiosis and resume the mitotic cell cycle. By returning to growth cells with high levels of JMs, we determined how JMs resolve in a mitotic cell cycle-like environment. We found that, during RTG, most JMs are taken apart without producing crossovers by Sgs1, a DNA unwinding enzyme. Because Sgs1 is homologous to the mammalian BLM helicase, it is likely that similar mechanisms reduce crossover production in mammals.
