 It is not clear whether light plays any role in determining menstrual cycles or ovulation in women. However, light is used as a treatment for some medical conditions related to rhythm, most notably seasonal affective disorder. In this study, the researchers wanted to examine the role of light in influencing the menstrual cycle. In the trial reported here, 22 women with lengthened menstrual cycles were provided with a light box that emitted either bright light or dim light, and the women were asked to use the light box for a defined period each day for one menstrual cycle. The study had a crossover design, where women would receive either bright or dim light for one cycle, then another cycle without the light box, and finally a cycle with either bright or dim light, whichever they did not receive first. Outcomes assessed in the trial included measurements of the blood levels of certain hormones. Specifically, the researchers looked at three hormones that determine the reproductive cycle (lutenizing hormone [LH], follicle stimulating hormone [FSH], and prolactin); these are produced by a region of the brain that is controlled by the hypothalamus, a gland that is directly responsive to light. Additionally, ultrasound scans were used to check for ovulation during each cycle. The trial was carried out in winter in Novosibirsk, a Russian city.
