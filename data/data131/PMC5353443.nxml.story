Infective endocarditis (IE) is defined as infection of endocardial surface of the heart. It may include one or more heart valves, the mural endocardium or a septal defect. Its intracardiac effect includes severe valvular insufficiency which may lead to intractable congestive heart failure and myocardial abscess. Infective endocarditis especially complicated by an abscess is associated with high mortality, despite the medical and surgical therapeutic options available. Surgical intervention is indicated in cases of heart failure or uncontrolled infection and sometimes for the prevention of embolic phenomena. We report a case of 42 yrs/M with RVHD admitted in Dr D.Y.Patil hospital, Kolhapur. He had high grade, continuous fever, vomiting, cough with expectoration since 15 days prior to admission. He had prior embolic stroke 2 months back from which he recovered completely. The diagnosis of Infective endocarditis was confirmed clinically & echocardiographically by Duke's criteria. His ECHO showed severe MR, Moderate MS and large vegetations on AML oscillating through mitral orifice along with subvalval (mitral) abscess. Due to severe haematemesis following Mallory weiss tear surgical intervention was not possible. Patient succumbed as a result of refractory pulmonary oedema.
