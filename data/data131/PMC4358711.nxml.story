Glucagon-like peptide-1 is an incretin hormone essential for normal human glucose homeostasis. Expression of the glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor in the myocardium has fuelled growing interest in the direct and indirect cardiovascular effects of native glucagon-like peptide-1, its degradation product glucagon-like peptide-1(9-36), and the synthetic glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists. Preclinical studies have demonstrated cardioprotective actions of all three compounds in the setting of experimental myocardial infarction and left ventricular systolic dysfunction. This has led to Phase 2 trials of native glucagon-like peptide-1 and incretin-based therapies in humans with and without Type 2 diabetes mellitus. These studies have demonstrated the ability of glucagon-like peptide-1, independent of glycaemic control, to positively modulate the metabolic and haemodynamic parameters of individuals with coronary artery disease and left ventricular systolic dysfunction. We aim to add to this growing body of evidence by studying the effect of chronic glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor activation on exercise-induced ischaemia in patients with chronic stable angina managed conservatively or awaiting revascularisation. The hypothesis being liraglutide, a subcutaneously injectable glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist, is able to improve exercise haemodynamics in patients with obstructive coronary artery disease when compared with saline placebo.
