Optical coherence tomography (OCT) is an intra-coronary diagnostic technique that provides detailed imagings of blood vessels in the current cardiac catheterization laboratory. The higher resolution of OCT often provides superior delineation of each structure compared with intravascular ultrasound (IVUS), and it can reliably visualize the microstructure of normal and diseased arteries. The capabilities of OCT are well suited for the identification of calcified plaque and neointima formation after stent implantation. It has been reported that OCT-guided percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) resulted in equivalent clinical and angiographic outcomes in comparison with IVUS-guided PCI. Recently, the three-dimensional reconstruction of OCT and a real-time point-to-point correspondence between coronary angiographic and OCT/OFDI images have been developed and provide useful information to PCI operators. The unique capabilities of OCT as an investigational tool for high-risk lesions will serve the cardiology community well, as it moves us toward a better understanding of atherosclerotic plaque. In addition, because of the development of new OCT technology, OCT has become a notable catheter-based imaging technology that can provide practical guidance for PCI in clinical settings.
