Invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC) is the most common type of breast cancer and the leading cause of breast cancer related mortality. In the present study, metabolomic profiles of 72 tissue samples and 146 serum samples were analysed using targeted liquid chromatography multiple reaction monitoring mass spectrometry (LC-MRM/MS) and untargeted gas chromatography mass spectrometry (GC-MS) approaches. Combination of univariate and multivariate statistical treatment identified significant alterations of 42 and 32 metabolites in tissue and serum samples of IDC, respectively when compared to control. Some of the metabolite changes from tissue were also reflected in serum, indicating a bi-directional interaction of metabolites in IDC. Additionally, 8 tissue metabolites and 9 serum metabolites showed progressive change from control to benign to IDC suggesting their possible role in malignant transformation. We have identified a panel of three metabolites viz. tryptophan, tyrosine, and creatine in tissue and serum, which could be useful in screening of IDC subjects from both control and benign. The metabolomic alterations in IDC showed perturbations in purine and pyrimidine metabolism, amino sugar metabolism, amino acid metabolism, fatty acid biosynthesis etc. Comprehensively, this study provides valuable insights into metabolic adaptations of IDC, which can help to identify diagnostic markers as well as potential therapeutic targets.
