Retrospectively, we identified a total of 31 patients who underwent a standardized method of surgical reconstruction for multi-ligament knee injuries since 2006 at a single institution. A single surgeon performed all operations. A total of 28 knees (26 patients) were included in the final analysis. We contacted patients at a minimum of 12 months postoperatively (mean: 40.5 months; range: 12-111 months) and administered the Multi-ligament Quality of Life Questionnaire (ML-QOL), 2000 International Knee Documentation Committee Subjective Knee Form (IKDC), and Lysholm Knee Scoring Scale. We performed independent two-sample t-tests to examine the difference in quality of life and functional measures for the following factors: age (â‰¤ 40 vs. > 40), sex, mechanism of injury, time to surgery ( 3 weeks), vascular injury, nerve injury, concomitant fracture, other injuries, Schenk classification for knee dislocation, manipulation, surgical release, previous knee ligament surgery, and subsequent revision. We then performed age-adjusted multivariable linear regression analysis, including factors that we found to be statistically significant in univariate analysis. A p-value of 0.05 was used for statistical significance and all analysis was performed using STATA (College Station, TX).
