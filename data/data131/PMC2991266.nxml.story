Maintaining the specificity of signal transduction pathways is critical to the ability of cells to process information, make decisions, and regulate their behavior. Preventing cross-talk often relies predominantly on molecular recognition and a set of specificity-determining residues in cognate proteins. Identifying these residues and understanding how they dictate specificity is still a major challenge. Additionally, we have a rudimentary understanding of how specificity evolves, particularly after gene duplication events. We tackled these questions using two-component signaling proteins, the largest family of bacterial signaling proteins. Using analyses of amino acid coevolution, we pinpointed a set of specificity residues in histidine kinases and their cognate substrates. Then, using systematic mutagenesis, we characterized the complete set of intermediates between two different signaling systems, EnvZ/OmpR and RstA/RstB. The results demonstrate that specificity residues contribute unequally and, importantly, that some residues depend substantially on the identity of neighboring residues. We also demonstrate how the specificity of EnvZ/OmpR can be reprogrammed to match that of RstB/RstA through a series of individual substitutions without disrupting the kinase/regulator interaction. Notably, this property is not shared by all trajectories from EnvZ/OmpR to RstA/RstB, suggesting that the duplication/divergence process that likely produced these two pathways may have been fundamentally constrained.
