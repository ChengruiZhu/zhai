. MAGE-A3/C2 mRNA expression was identified in 73% (151/206) and 53% (109/206) of patients with NSCLC, respectively. MAGE-A3/C2 protein expression was identified in 58% (44/76) and 53% (40/76) of NSCLC cases, respectively. MAGE-A3 mRNA expression was observed to be associated with smoking history, disease stage and lymph node metastasis. However, no association was identified between MAGE-C2 mRNA expression and the clinicopathological characteristics of patients with NSCLC. MAGE-A3/C2-positive patients had a poorer survival rate compared with MAGE-A3/C2-negative patients. Multivariate analysis identified that MAGE-A3 expression may serve as an independent marker of poor prognosis in patients with NSCLC. Downregulation of MAGE-A3 mRNA expression in A549 cells resulted in lower migration and colony formation rates, and a higher amount of epithelial marker and lower amount of mesenchymal marker expression compared with the control group. These results indicate that MAGE-A3 serves a role in NSCLC cell metastasis through the induction of epithelial-mesenchymal transition. In conclusion, MAGE-A3 may serve as a diagnostic and prognostic biomarker for patients with NSCLC, due to its association with tumor progression and poor clinical outcome.
