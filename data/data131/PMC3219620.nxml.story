The striatum is the main input station of the basal ganglia and plays a crucial role in multiple motor and cognitive functions. Striatum is a recurrently connected network of GABAergic medium spiny neurons (MSNs), which receive strong feedforward inhibition from the fast spiking interneurons and massive excitatory afferents from various regions of the neocortex via the cortico-striatal projection neurons. Here, we study the effects of input rate and temporal correlations on signal representation in a computational model of striatum. We show that when individual striatal neurons receive weakly correlated input from the neocortex, signal representation is enhanced. Surprisingly, though, if the inputs to two striatal neurons are correlated, signal representation is impaired. In a restricted sense, correlation in the inputs to two neurons implies that these neurons share their input, which according to our model would not be optimal for signal representation. Interestingly, cortico-striatal projections are structured in such a way that neighboring MSNs are not likely to share their presynaptic cortical neurons. Thus, we suggest that an appropriate structure of correlations in the striatal inputs sets the stage for implementation of various tasks performed by the basal ganglia, supported by the special anatomical structure of the cortico-striatal projections.
