A soluble allogeneic effect factor (AEF) was produced by using H-2 congenic mouse strains and a serum.free cell culture medium. An AEF derived from untreated activated responder cells and irradiated stimulator cells provided helper cell function in a primary and secondary antibody response for both T-cell-depleted responder B cells and stimulator B cells. This interaction may be determined by genes situated in the I-A and I-B regions: additional K-region control was not excluded. Ia antigens, but neither H-2 nor Ig determinants are molecular constituents of AEF. The active components of this AEF consist, in part, of Ia antigens derived from both the activated responder cell population and irradiated stimulator cell population. An AEF derived from Ia negative responder cells and irradiated T-cell- depleted stimulator cells helps a secondary antibody response of T-cell- depleted stimulator B cells but not responder B cells. This genetically restricted AEF contains Ia antigens determined by the stimulator haplotype but not the responder haplotype. The priming antigen, DNP- keyhole limpet hemocyanin, is not a component of restricted AEF. The data suggest that restricted AEF may be a product of a stimulator B cell and/or macrophage. They support the hypothesis that the recognition by allogeneic T cells of Ia antigens on B cells activates the B cell to IgG antibody production.
