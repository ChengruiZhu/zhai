Tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC), caused by loss-of-function mutations in the TSC1 or TSC2 gene, is characterized by benign tumor formation in multiple organs. Hyperactivation of mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) is the primary alteration underlying TSC tumors. By analyzing Tsc2-null mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) and rat uterine leiomyoma-derived Tsc2-null ELT3 cells, we detected evidence for the involvement of cyclooxygenase 2 (COX2) as a downstream target of mTORC1 in the development of TSC tumors. We showed that loss of TSC2 led to decreased COX2 expression through activation of an mTORC1/signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) signaling pathway. Overexpression of COX2 promoted proliferation and tumoral growth of Tsc2-null cells. COX2 knockdown inhibited the proliferation of the control cells. COX2 enhanced Tsc2-null cell growth through upregulation of interleukin-6 (IL-6). In addition, rapamycin in combination with celecoxib, a COX2 inhibitor, strongly inhibited Tsc2-deficient cell growth. We conclude that downregulation of COX2 exerts a protective effect against hyperactivated mTORC1-mediated tumorigenesis caused by the loss of TSC2, and the combination of rapamycin and celecoxib may be an effective new approach to treating TSC.
