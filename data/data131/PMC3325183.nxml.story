All cells interact with their environment, including other cells, to elicit cellular responses. Cell窶田ell interactions between eukaryotic cells are widely appreciated as large multicellular organisms coordinate cell behaviors for tissue and organ functions. In bacteria cell窶田ell interactions are not widely appreciated, as these organisms are relatively simple and are often depicted as single-cell entities. However, over the past decade, the concept of bacteria living in microbial communities or biofilms has received broad acceptance as a major lifestyle. As biofilm cells are packed in tight physical contact, there is an opportunity for cell窶田ell signaling to provide spatial and physiological clues of neighboring cells to elicit cellular responses. Although much has been learned about diffusible signals through quorum sensing, little is known about cell contact窶電ependent signaling in bacteria. In this report we describe a new mechanism where bacterial cells within structured biofilms form contacts that allow cellular material to be exchanged. This exchange elicits phenotypic changes, including in cell movements and development. We hypothesize that OM exchange involves kin recognition that bestows social benefits to myxobacterial populations.
