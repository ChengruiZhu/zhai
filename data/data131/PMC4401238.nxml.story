Out of 500 patients, 110 patients had abnormal Doppler among them, 70 patients had abnormal uterine artery Doppler, and 50 patients had abnormal umbilical artery Doppler flow indices. In all, 10 patients had both umbilical artery and uterine artery abnormal Doppler indices. When uterine artery was abnormal (70 patients), 20 patients had preeclampsia, 10 patients had pregnancy-induced hypertension (PIH), and 25 patients had intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR). Systolic/diastolic (S/D) ratio and notch had sensitivity of 60% and positive predictive value of 33.3% and 37.5%, respectively. When umbilical artery was abnormal (50 patients), 10 had preeclampsia, 15 had PIH, and 15 had IUGR. S/D ratio had the highest positive predictive value of 40%; sensitivity is same for all. In uterine artery, combination of parameters had the best sensitivity of 80%, followed by notch and S/D ratio. In umbilical artery, combination of parameters, S/D ratio, and RI (resistance index) had sensitivity of 40%; specificity of all the indices was 91â€“96%. In all, 20 patients had bilateral notch, and among them 15 developed preeclampsia and 15 developed IUGR. When both uterine and umbilical artery Doppler were abnormal (10 patients), all patients had preeclampsia and IUGR.
