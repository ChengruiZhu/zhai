Among the 796 women included, 10.1% were triple-negative (TN) and 18.8% were HER2-positive and 24.6% of them had received neoadjuvant chemotherapy (CT). Internal mammary chain (IMC), supraclavicular (Level IV), infraclavicular (Levels III and II) and axillary LN (Level I) were treated in 85.6%, 88.3%, 77.9% and 14.9% of cases, respectively. With a median follow-up of 64 months (range: 6–102), 5-year locoregional (RFS and OS were 90% (95% CI: 88.1–92.4) and 90.9% (95% CI: 88.9–93), respectively. Twenty-three patients (2.9%) presented locoregional recurrences. Most of them presented aggressive biological features with grade III tumors in 17 patients (74%) with high mitotic index in 16 cases (70%) and triple negative tumors in 12 (52%). Lymphovascular invasion (LVI) was observed in 11 cases (48%). In 14 cases the locoregional recurrences were diagnosed at the same time as the metastatic disease whereas 4 patients presented distant metastases secondarily. Local (Chest wall) recurrences occurred in 13 cases (56%) with the coverage by the isodose of 47.5 Gy (isodose 95%). Fifteen regional recurrences (lymph nodes) were observed in 13 patients. Only 3 regional recurrences occurred within irradiated volumes and 12 regional recurrences occurred outside irradiated areas.
