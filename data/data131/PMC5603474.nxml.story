Measurement of biomarkers has been incorporated within clinical research of asthma to characterize the population and to associate the disease with environmental and therapeutic effects. Regrettably, at present, there are no specific biomarkers, none is validated or qualified, and endotype-driven choices overlap. Biomarkers have not yet reached clinical practice and are not included in current asthma guidelines. Last but not least, the choice of the outcome upholding the value of the biomarkers is extremely difficult, since it has to reflect the mechanistic intervention while being relevant to both the disease and the particular person. On the verge of a new age of asthma healthcare standard, we must embrace and adapt to the key drivers of change. Disease endotypes, biomarkers, and precision medicine represent an emerging model of patient care building on large-scale biologic databases, omics and diverse cellular assays, health information technology, and computational tools for analyzing sizable sets of data. A profound transformation of clinical and research pattern from population to individual risk and from investigator-imposed subjective disease clustering (hypothesis driven) to unbiased, data-driven models is facilitated by the endotype/biomarker-driven approach.
