Although remote ischemic pre-conditioning (RIPC) reduced infarct size in animal experiments and proof-of-concept clinical trials, recent phase III trials failed to confirm cardioprotection during cardiac surgery. Here, we characterized the kinetic properties of humoral factors that are released after RIPC, as well as the signal transduction pathways that were responsible for cardioprotection in an ex vivo model of global ischemia reperfusion injury. Venous blood from 20 healthy volunteers was collected at baseline and 5 min, 30 min, 1 h, 6 h, and daily from 1 to 7 days after RIPC (3 × 5/5 min upper-limb ischemia/reperfusion). Plasma-dialysates (cut-off: 12 to 14 kDa; dilution: 1:20) were infused into Langendorff-perfused mouse hearts subjected to 20/120 min global ischemia/reperfusion. Infarct size and phosphorylation of signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT)3, STAT5, extracellular-regulated kinase 1/2 and protein kinase B were determined. In a subgroup of plasma-dialysates, an inhibitor of STAT3 (Stattic) was used in mouse hearts. Perfusion with baseline-dialysate resulted in an infarct size of 39% of ventricular mass (interquartile range: 36% to 42%). Perfusion with dialysates obtained 5 min to 6 days after RIPC significantly reduced infarct size by ∼50% and increased STAT3 phosphorylation beyond that with baseline-dialysate. Inhibition of STAT3 abrogated these effects. These results suggest that RIPC induces the release of cardioprotective, dialyzable factor(s) within 5 min, and that circulate for up to 6 days. STAT3 is activated in murine myocardium by RIPC-induced human humoral factors and is causally involved in cardioprotection.
