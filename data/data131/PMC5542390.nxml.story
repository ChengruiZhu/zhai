Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection can cause several types of cancer associated with its major target in humans, the mature B cell. Furthermore, EBV is one of the most potent transforming agents ever identified, producing—in vitro—‘immortal’ B lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCLs) with outstanding reliability. However, the near-symbiotic relationship between EBV and its natural host (>95% of human adults are asymptomatically infected) provides a powerful argument that this gamma-herpesvirus did not primarily evolve to be a harmful tumour-causing virus. Consistent with this, we show here that 2 of the potentially oncogenic viral proteins (EBNA3A and EBNA3C) have evolved not to facilitate oncogenic progression but to block plasma cell differentiation in EBV-activated B cells. Specifically, they act to interrupt the gene regulation network that drives activated B cells to become terminally differentiated, quiescent plasma cells, thus allowing for sustained regeneration of virally infected B cells. EBNA3A and EBNA3C achieve this by epigenetically inhibiting expression of cellular genes essential for the differentiation pathway; these include the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p18
