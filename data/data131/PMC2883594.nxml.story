Bacteria adjust which proteins they make, and how many copies of each kind, depending on their environment. The production rate of each regulated protein is controlled by a special class of proteins called transcription factors. The rate at which a certain protein is produced usually depends on the cellular concentrations of a few such transcription factors. When circumstances change, the concentrations of these transcription factors alter too and consequently the production rates of all proteins regulated by them are adjusted. Interestingly, many transcription factors also regulate their own synthesis rate. This suggests that this self-regulation must have one or more important functions. In this article we study one possible function. In order for cells to function properly each protein concentration has to respond in a particular way to changes in transcription factor concentrations. We have studied how bacteria can optimize and fine-tune these responses. To this end, we formulated a physical model of the regulation by transcription factors and performed computer simulations. These simulations show that self-regulation—and in particular self-activation—is often a useful tool to achieve the prescribed response. Therefore we conclude that natural selection on the regulation of protein levels could naturally lead to self-regulation.
