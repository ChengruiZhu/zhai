The corpus consisted of 48% H and 52% NH documents as determined by human review. The NLP algorithm successfully extracted concepts from these documents. The H set had an average of 8 concepts related to homelessness per document (median 8, range 1 to 34). The NH set had an average 2 concepts (median 1, range 1 to 13)”. Thirteen template patterns were identified in this set of documents. The three most common were check boxes with square brackets, Yes/No and free text answer after a question. Several positively and negatively asserted concepts were noted to be in the responses to templated questions such as “Are you currently homeless: Yes or No”; “How many times have you been homeless in the past 3 years: (free text response)”; “Have you ever been in jail? [Y] or [N]”; Are you in need of substance abuse services? Yes or No”. Human review of a random sample of documents at the concept level indicated that the NLP algorithm generated 28% false positives in extracting concepts related to homelessness when templates were ignored among the H documents. When the algorithm was refined to include templates, the false positive rate declined to 22%. For the NH documents, the corresponding false positive rates were 56% and 21%.
