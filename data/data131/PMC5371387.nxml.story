Precisely controlled host-microbe interactions in the gastrointestinal tract are crucial for human overall health and well-being. Dysregulated host responses to gut microbiota are the major cause of autoimmune diseases, inflammatory disorders and cancers. The intestinal epithelium lines the gastrointestinal tract and plays a critical role in sensing gut microbes and subsequently developing a balance of immune tolerance and active immune responses. During the neonatal stage, the immune system in the gastrointestinal tract must be temporally suppressed to accommodate the large number of newly arrived microbes. This process is known as neonatal immune adaptation, and is critical for the establishment of proper host- microbe interactions. We studied the function of hnRNPI in the intestinal epithelium by genetically ablating it in the intestinal epithelial cells of mouse. We found that loss of hnRNPI in intestinal epithelial cells disrupts neonatal immune adaptation, resulting in spontaneous colitis and early onset of invasive colorectal cancer. We show that hnRNPI is required for the neonatal immune suppression through decreasing the protein level of IRAK1, an essential component of toll-like receptor-mediated NF-ÎºB signaling. Our studies demonstrate a critical role of hnRNPI in establishing neonatal immune adaptation and preventing colitis and colorectal cancer.
