=129) as epithelial-like or mesenchymal-like, using a recently developed immunohistochemistry-based classification tool. We observed considerable discordance (45%) in the classification of primary tumors and their liver metastases. Discordant classification was significantly associated with the use of neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Furthermore, gene expression analysis of chemotherapy-exposed versus chemotherapy naive liver metastases revealed expression of a mesenchymal program in pre-treated tumors. To explore whether chemotherapy could cause gene expression changes influencing molecular subtyping, we exposed patient-derived colonospheres to six short cycles of 5-fluorouracil. Gene expression profiling and signature enrichment analysis subsequently revealed that the expression of signatures identifying mesenchymal-like tumors was strongly increased in chemotherapy-exposed tumor cultures. Unsupervised clustering of large cohorts of human colon tumors with the chemotherapy-induced gene expression program identified a poor prognosis mesenchymal-like subgroup. We conclude that neoadjuvant chemotherapy induces a mesenchymal phenotype in residual tumor cells and that this may influence the molecular classification of colorectal tumors.
