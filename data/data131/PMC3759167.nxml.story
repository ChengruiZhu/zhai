Protein aggregation is associated with many debilitating diseases
including Alzheimer’s, Parkinson’s, and light-chain
amyloidosis (AL). Additionally, such aggregation is a major problem
in an industrial setting where antibody therapeutics often require
high local concentrations of protein domains to be stable for substantial
periods of time. However, despite a plethora of research in this field,
dating back over 50 years, there is still no consensus on the mechanistic
basis for protein aggregation. Here we use experimental data to derive
a mechanistic model that well describes the aggregation of Titin I27,
an immunoglobulin-like domain. Importantly, we find that models that
are suitable for nucleated fibril formation do not fit our aggregation
data. Instead, we show that aggregation proceeds via the addition
of activated dimers, and that the rate of aggregation is dependent
on the surface area of the aggregate. Moreover, we suggest that the
“lag time” seen in these studies is not the time needed
for a nucleation event to occur, but rather it is the time taken for
the concentration of activated dimers to cross a particular solubility
limit. These findings are reminiscent of the Finke–Watzky aggregation
mechanism, originally based on nanocluster formation and suggest that
amorphous aggregation processes may require mechanistic schemes that
are substantially different from those of linear fibril formation.
