The objective of the authors is to highlight the historical complexities for the diagnosis and treatment of hypoactive sexual desire disorder (HSDD) with a focus on Flibanserin. A systematic review of the medical literature published in PubMed using the search terms HSDD and Flibanserin was conducted. Each author reviewed the results of the systematic review for articles to include in this study. HSDD is defined as a persistent or recurrent deficiency or absence of sexual fantasies and desire for sexual activity causing marked distress or interpersonal difficulty that is not better accounted for by another diagnosis. Until 2015, only homeopathic products and off-label use of prescription medications were medical treatment options for women with HSDD. Flibanserin, approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 2015, is the first to target female HSDD in premenopausal women. Flibanserin is a centrally acting nonhormonal oral medication taken once daily that affects serotonin, dopamine and norepinephrine levels, the key neurotransmitters in the biology of desire. Understanding prescribing guidelines and awareness of black box warnings is paramount for prescribers. Adherence to proper oversight will ensure Flibanserin can fulfil an unmet need for an FDA approved prescription medication for the treatment of HSDD in premenopausal women.
