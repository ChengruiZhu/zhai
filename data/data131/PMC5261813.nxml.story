Essential tremor (ET) is acknowledged to be the most common movement disorder affecting 1% of the population. Although the underlying mechanisms remain elusive, the thalamus, cortex and cerebellum are implicated in the underlying pathology. More recently, it has been shown that ET can be successfully treated by deep brain stimulation (DBS). This clinical treatment involves the surgical implantation of electrodes into the brain, through which current is applied. However, the mechanisms of how DBS achieves clinical benefit continue to be debated. A key question is whether ET can be modeled as a pathological network behavior as has been suggested previously. If so, we can then ask how DBS would modulate this brain activity. Our study combines: (i) simultaneous electrophysiological recordings from the brain and muscle; (ii) computational modelling; (iii) mathematical analysis. We found that the network supports oscillations in the tremor range, and the application of high frequency DBS switches this to low amplitude, high-frequency activity. We propose that our model can be used to predict DBS parameter settings that suppress pathological network activity and consequently tremor. In summary, we provide the first population level model of essential tremor including the effect of DBS on network behaviour.
