Periodic and spontaneous nosebleed is the most common clinical manifestation of hereditary haemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT), present in 95% of patients suffering from this syndrome. The purpose of this retrospective study was to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of diathermocoagulation of telangiectasia on the nasal mucosa with a diode laser in the treatment of epistaxis in patients with HHT. From 2005 to 2010, 24 patients diagnosed with HHT and with mild-severe nosebleed were treated in our hospital with diode laser. Patients were given a pre- and post-operation evaluation questionnaire to determine the frequency and severity of nosebleed, the recurrence-free period of time after treatment and quality of life. We compared the pre- and post-operation haemoglobin values three months after the last treatment. After treatment, a decrease in the weekly frequency and entity of nosebleed was observed, together with substantial improvement in the quality of life and an increase in haematic haemoglobin. Diode laser treatment of telangiectasia on nasal mucosa represents a valuable, safe, effective and repeatable therapeutic option in treating mild and severe nosebleed, and it is associated with improvement in quality of life from psychological, social and clinical points of view.
