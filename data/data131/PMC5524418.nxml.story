The rhythmic activity of spiking neurons is known to be sensitive to noise. In such neurons, inverse stochastic resonance (ISR), in which the average spiking activity of a neuron exhibits a pronounced minimum as the noise intensity increases, can occur. But macroscopic phenomena such as information processing, cognition, and mental diseases take place at the level of populations of neurons, and, presumably are strongly influenced by the connectivity structure of the network. Here we investigate the occurrence of ISR in large populations of networked spiking neurons. We find that ISR can emerge in such networks as a consequence of many different factors, including channel noise, connection strength, synaptic currents with excitatory and inhibitory terms, and topological features of the network including degree distribution and mean connectivity degree. We describe the dynamical mechanisms that give rise to various features of ISR in such networks. We find that inhibitory coupled networks favor ISR behavior and are more robust to changes in neural circuit features than electrically or excitatory coupled networks. Our work suggests that network ISR may be observable in local field potential measurements of neuronal activity in brain slice preparations, cultures, and perhaps even in EEG recordings.
