Alzheimerâ€²s disease (AD) represents a highly common form of dementia, but can be diagnosed in the earlier stages before dementia onset. Early diagnosis is crucial for successful therapeutic intervention. The introduction of new diagnostic biomarkers for AD is aimed at detecting underlying brain pathology. These biomarkers reflect structural or biochemical changes related to AD. Examination of cerebrospinal fluid has many drawbacks; therefore, the search for sensitive and specific blood markers is ongoing. Investigation is mainly focused on upstream processes, among which oxidative stress in the brain is of particular interest. Products of oxidative stress may diffuse into the blood and evaluating them can contribute to diagnosis of AD. However, results of blood oxidative stress markers are not consistent among various studies, as documented in this review. To find a specific biochemical marker for AD, we should concentrate on specific metabolic products formed in the brain. Specific fluorescent intermediates of brain lipid peroxidation may represent such candidates as the composition of brain phospholipids is unique. They are small lipophilic molecules and can diffuse into the blood stream, where they can then be detected. We propose that these fluorescent products are potential candidates for blood biomarkers of AD.
