This paper reports what is, to the best of our knowledge, the first genome-wide association (GWA) study with metabolic traits as phenotypic traits. By simultaneous measurements of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and serum concentrations of endogenous organic compounds in a human population, we identify genetically determined variants in metabolic phenotype (metabotype) that exhibit large effect sizes. Four of these polymorphisms are located in genes coding for well-characterized enzymes of the lipid metabolism. We find that individuals with different genotypes in these genes have significantly different metabolic capacities with respect to the synthesis of some polyunsaturated fatty acids, the beta-oxidation of short- and medium-chain fatty acids, and the breakdown of triglycerides. In this approach, the concept of the “genetically determined metabotype” as an intermediate phenotype is central, as it becomes a measurable quantity in the framework of GWA studies with metabolomics. The investigation of the genetically determined metabotypes in their biochemical context might help to better understand the pathogenesis of common diseases and gene–environment interactions. These findings could result in a step towards personalized health care and nutrition based on a combination of genotyping and metabolic characterization.
