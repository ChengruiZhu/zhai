The size between different organisms ranges considerably, yet, the size of the individuals and even the same types of cells within the individuals are remarkably constant. Cell size emerges from the balance between how fast the cell grows and the frequency with which it divides. This system level coordination of growth and division is universal across species and is required to ensure faithful duplication and genetically intact offspring. We have devised a computational model for the interplay of growth and division in the premier model organism, Baker’s yeast, to test the fundamental architecture of this coupling and to assess the role that cell size itself can play in it. In contrast to traditional theories that assume a yet-to-be-determined cell size sensor, our model relies on a single mechanism, effectively measuring the cell’s translational capacity, applied twice at different stages of the cell’s life-cycle to explain this coupling. In our model, a growth condition specific cell size emerges, as has been found in experiments. Our analysis shows how the nature of the two linked properties growth and proliferation can shape eukaryotic cells and explain cell size as an emergent rather than regulatory property of this process.
