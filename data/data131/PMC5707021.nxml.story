The modifying effects of long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) recently have drawn much attention; however, the underlying mechanisms remain largely unknown. Herein, we aim to investigate the expression profile of lncRNAs in RA and identify promising targets for RA diagnosis and treatment. Microarray screening and real-time PCR of lncRNAs were performed by use of serum samples from 3 RA patients and 3 healthy controls. Significantly differentially expressed lncRNAs were verified in serum samples from 43 RA patients and 40 healthy controls by real-time PCR. We found that there were 73 up-regulated and 61 down-regulated lncRNAs as well as 128 up-regulated and 37 down-regulated mRNAs in serum samples of RA patients. Validation in RA clinical samples indicated 5 of these lncRNAs were significantly up-regulated including RNA143598, RNA143596, HIX0032090, IGHCgamma1, and XLOC_002730. Significant association was observed between these lncRNAs and the disease course, erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), rheumatoid factor (RF) as well as anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide (anti-CCP) antibody. Additionally, 55 of the differentially expressed mRNAs were associated with 41 lncRNAs and were involved in signaling pathways of toll like receptors (TLRs), nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-ÎºB), and cytokine, especially the IRF3/IRF7 mediated signaling transduction. Our study firstly shows the specific profile of lncRNAs in the serum of RA patients and potential signaling pathways involved in RA pathogenesis, which may provide novel targets for the diagnosis and treatment of patients with RA.
