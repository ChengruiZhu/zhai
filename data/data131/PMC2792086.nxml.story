Contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) has unique advantages over contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in the characterization of hepatic tumors. These include the capability of real-time dynamic imaging depicting the enhancement pattern of tumors regardless of its rapidity, purely intravascular properties of the microbubble contrast agents more consistently demonstrating washout of malignancy, and capability of repetitive observation of tumor vascularity with multiple injections of microbubbles with an excellent safety profile and no nephrotoxicity. For an indeterminate mass detected on an ultrasound scan, an immediate benign diagnosis reduces the necessity of costly further imaging as well as patientsâ€™ anxiety and an immediate malignant diagnosis prompts the proper work-up and management. CEUS is often served as a problem-solving tool for indeterminate lesions on prior CT or MRI scans, obviating further invasive steps. CEUS offers excellent visualization of peripheral nodular enhancement in even flash-filling or very slow-filling hemangiomas. Careful observation of early arterial filling pattern is helpful in the differentiation of focal nodular hyperplasia versus adenoma. Hepatocellular carcinoma is typically characterized by arterial hypervascularity and often late, partial washout. Metastasis shows brief arterial hypervascularity and complete rapid washout, which can improve its detection during a portal phase survey. The washout phenomenon of malignant tumors in general is useful to differentiate them from benign lesions.
