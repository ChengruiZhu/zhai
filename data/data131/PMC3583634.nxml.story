Recently, a number of electric and electrothermal therapies have been applied to the treatment of specific cancer types. However, the cellular and molecular mechanisms involved in the response to such therapies have not been well characterized yet. Capacitive-resistive electric transfer (CRET) therapy uses electric currents at frequencies within the 0.45â€“0.6 MHz range to induce hyperthermia in target tissues. Preliminary trials in cancer patients have shown consistent signs that CRET could slow down growth of tumor tissues in brain gliomas, without inducing detectable damage in the surrounding healthy tissue. Previous studies by our group have shown that subthermal treatment with 0.57-MHz electric currents can induce a cytostatic, not cytotoxic response in HepG2 human hepatocarcinoma cells; such effect being mediated by cell cycle alterations. In contrast, the study of the response of NB69 human neuroblastoma cells to the same electric treatment revealed consistent indications of cytotoxic effects. The present study extends the knowledge on the response of NB69 cells to the subthermal stimulus, comparing it to that of primary cultures of human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) exposed to the same treatment. The results showed no sensitivity of PBMC to the 0.57 MHz subthermal currents and confirmed that the treatment exerts a cytotoxic action in NB69 cells. The data also revealed a previously undetected cytostatic response of the neuroblastoma cell line. CRET currents affected NB69 cell proliferation by significantly reducing the fraction of cells in the phase G
