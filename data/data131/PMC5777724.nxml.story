The incidence of lung adenocarcinoma has been increasing recently in smokers. The molecular target therapy has been developed for lung adenocarcinoma patients harboring EGFR gene mutation. However, the treatment modalities for patients without mutation are currently limited. Thus, analysis of EGFR gene mutation status at early stage is important strategy to classify the patients for improving treatments and prognosis efficiently. This study aimed to identify microRNA (miRNA) signature in relation to mutation status in EGFR gene in early stage of lung adenocarcinoma male patients with smoking history. MiRNA profiles were assessed by microarray in paired plasma and tissue pooled from 10 EGFR wild type (EGFR-wt) and 10 EGFR mutated (EGFR-mut) patients. Expressions of selected miRNAs were verified further by real-time qRT-PCR in 83 plasma samples consisting of 55 EGFR-wt patients and 28 EGFR-mut patients and their correlation with clinicopathological parameters and EGFR gene mutation status were evaluated. We found that seven miRNAs (miR-16-5p, miR-23a-3p, miR-103a-3p, miR122-5p, miR-223-3p, miR-346 and miR-451a) were differentially expressed in stage I and stage I+II. Especially, miR-23a-3p was only miRNA shown higher expression in EGFR-wt patients than EGFR-mut patients. Thus, our findings could be useful non-invasive biomarkers to differentiate mutation status in EGFR gene in smoker lung adenocarcinoma male patients.
