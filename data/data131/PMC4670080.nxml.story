South America is home to over 400 million people who share a rich demographic history, including settlement by Native Americans, European colonization, and the African slave trade. We use genomic data to infer which populations from Europe and the Americas contributed to these admixture events. We provide evidence for multiple origins of the Native American ancestry of admixed South American Latinos. The Native American ancestral component correlates strongly with geography, indicating that admixture occurred between European colonists and local Native American populations throughout South America. We also show that the European ancestry of South American Latinos comes mainly from the Iberian peninsula, however, a significant number of Argentinians have European ancestry from other Southern European regions. The genetic signal of European admixture in South American populations is younger than the signal observed in Mexico and the Caribbean. We find evidence for a second pulse of European migration to many regions of South America subsequent to the original colonization. These results demonstrate the heterogeneous nature of the Latino population in South America and help elucidate the complex genetic and admixture events that shaped the population structure of the region.
