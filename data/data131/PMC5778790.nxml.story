Docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) oil is an important polyunsaturated fatty acid for the human body. Evidence has demonstrated that DHA is beneficial for inhibiting mammary carcinogenesis. However, the mechanisms of DHA mediating apoptosis induction have not been fully elucidated. Thus, in the present study, the activity levels of total-superoxide dismutase (t-SOD), catalase (CAT), glutathione-peroxidase (GSH-PX) and the concentration of malondialdehyde (MDA) were determined in DHA oil-treated human malignant breast tissues. The results revealed that compared with control, DHA significantly increased the main antioxidant enzymes levels, including t-SOD, CAT, and GSH-PX, but decreased the MDA concentration in the DHA oil treated breast cancer tissues. Furthermore, DHA significantly increased the ratio of cyclic (c)AMP/cGMP levels and promoted the expression of Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR-4) and peroxisome proliferator activated receptor (PPAR)-α, thus DHA induced breast cancer cell apoptosis. We hypothesized that the levels of TLR-4 and PPAR-α are involved in the antitumorigenesis properties of DHA in breast cancer. The results of the present study hold significance for the further clinical development of DHA oil in breast cancer treatment.
