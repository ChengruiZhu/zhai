Sleep pressure is reflected in the power of slow-wave activity: it is high after extended wakefulness and gradually decays in the course of the night. Transcranial stimulation with slow-oscillating currents can entrain electro-encephalographic slow-wave oscillations (SWO) and transiently increase their power. Motivated by the results from a multi-scale computational model, we tested in humans whether 25 minutes of transcranial stimulation attenuates the decay of SWO in the remainder of the night. A Finite-Element Model (FEM) is used to estimate the current flow in the brain and a network model of spiking neurons determines the resultant effect on SWO. This multi-scale model predicted increased neuronal firing rates leading to accelerated synaptic downscaling. As a consequence, the decay of SWO power and spatial coherence after stimulation is reduced. In addition to reduced decay rate, the model was also able to successfully predict, in the human experiments, the spatial distribution of the effect across EEG electrodes. These combined experimental and modeling results suggest a mechanism by which electrical stimulation can accelerate synaptic homeostasis and thereby influence a putative process of sleep regulation. The ability to accelerate the homeostatic function of sleep may have important practical implications.
