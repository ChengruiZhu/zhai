The sample is composed of 60 participants randomly selected and affected by different neuromuscular diseases (e.g. Myasthenia Gravis, Becker Muscular Dystrophy, Facioescapulohumeral Muscular Dystrophy, etc.). Thirty patients were assigned to the experimental group, which participated in the chat and videoconferencing sessions, and the other thirty to the control group, which did not participate. The inclusion criteria for both groups were: medical confirmed diagnosis (CIE-10) of one of the diseases mentioned above, age ≥18 years, agreeing to participate in the study by signing an informed consent, and finally, ability to manipulate a computer (just for the experimental group). The exclusion criteria for both groups were to have a psychiatric disorder (DSM-IV-TR), head trauma or severe visual limitations. All the patients were recruited from neuromuscular disorders associations and Hospitals of The Basque Country. Effectiveness were assessed by a pre-post design in which questionnaires and interviews were administrated (e.g. Disability Assessment Schedule—WHO-DAS II, Sickness Impact Profile, The MOS Social Support Survey, etc.). The online support entails different activities developed during three months in once a week sessions: a) Group videoconference sessions with a Psychologist, b) Individual videoconference sessions with a Neurologist, and c) Forum discussion groups about biopsychosocial issues.
