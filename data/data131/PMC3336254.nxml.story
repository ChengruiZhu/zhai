Dawali (varicose vein) is first described in Ebers Papyrus over 3500 years ago. Dawali is a disease in which veins of legs and feet become dilated, tortuous, and greenish in colour due to excess accumulation of blood which is derived from saudavi madda & balgham ghaleez. The aetiology of varicose veins is still incompletely under stood, despite the fact that it is a very common disease affecting all ages from teenagers to elderly people. The complication of varicose veins like venous eczema, venous pigmentation, lipodermatosclerosis, superficial thrombophlebitis, venous ulceration, etc impair health related quality of life significantly. The objective of the study is to evaluate the efficacy of Taleeq in Dawali and to provide safe & cost effective alternative treatment.
