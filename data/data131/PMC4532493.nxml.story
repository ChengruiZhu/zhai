The researchers interviewed 20 HIV-positive patients (mainly men) attending two urban US HIV clinics who were either ART-naive or ART-experienced but off ART and their HIV care providers; 15 patient-provider dyads were re-interviewed after at least 3 months and another clinic visit. Patients were asked about their attitudes to ART, their ART usage, and their relationship with their provider. Providers were asked about their ART philosophy, how they discussed ART with their patients, and about their relationship with their paired patient. Nearly all the patients were willing to consider ART and 40% began ART during the study. Reasons given by patients for accepting ART included education about newer, more tolerable drugs but the strength of the provider recommendation of ART was particularly important in patient decisions to accept ART. Specifically, many patients had internalized messages from their providers that their health was too good to warrant ART. Providers for their part often muted the offer of ART to patients experiencing psychosocial problems who they believed would find it hard to adhere to treatment. Finally, patient interviews suggested that motivations for retention in HIV care in the absence of ART included access to viral monitoring and the patient-provider relationship.
