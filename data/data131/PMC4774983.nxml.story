Bacteria are able to rapidly change their characteristics, such as antibiotic resistance, by acquiring genes from surrounding cells. Some sets of genes, called mobile genetic elements (MGEs), drive their own movement between bacterial cells by transmitting in viral or viral-like manners. These selfish genes spread themselves, even if harmful to their bacterial host. Some bacteria also actively absorb DNA from the environment, a process known as transformation. Why bacteria employ transformation is controversial. Importing all DNA molecules at the same rate means cells acquire detrimental and beneficial mutations at equal frequencies. However, transformation does exhibit a known bias: it preferentially imports shorter DNA molecules, meaning it tends to delete, rather than insert, genes. By incorporating this bias into computer simulations, we show that the spread of a selfish mobile genetic element between bacteria is inhibited when cells use transformation to delete it from their genomes. We hypothesised that this ability to delete selfish mobile genetic elements is an important function of transformation. To test this hypothesis, we analysed longitudinal bacterial samples from individuals colonised by
