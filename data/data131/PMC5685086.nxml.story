Bioelectric impedance analysis (BIA) devices are commonly used to estimate percent body fat (%fat), although validation of their accuracy varies widely. The purpose of this study was to assess the validity of four commonly used BIA devices compared to dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA). College-aged men (n = 29, age = 19.7 ± 1.2 y, weight = 76.9 ± 12.5 kg) and women (n = 31, age = 20.5 ± 0.8 y, weight = 61.5 ± 9.2 kg) were evaluated for %fat using four single-frequency (50 mHz) BIA devices and DXA. A gender × device repeated measures ANOVA indicated some less expensive BIA devices produced %fat values that were not significantly different from DXA. A thumb-to-thumb BIA device produced the closest values in men (21.9 ± 6.6%) and women (32.1 ± 5.3%) compared to DXA (20.6 ± 6.1% and 30.3 ± 5.4%, respectively). The two more expensive BIA devices significantly underestimated in men (14.7 ± 5.8% and 17.0 ± 5.6%) and women (23.3 ± 4.2% and 23.3 ± 4.2%) compared to DXA. Interclass correlation coefficients with DXA were higher for the more expensive devices in men (ICC = 0.899 and 0.958) than the less expensive devices (ICC = 0.681 and 0.730). In women, all BIA devices showed moderate correlations with DXA (ICC = 0.537 to 0.658). Despite the convenience of simple BIA devices, their use in estimating body composition in young men and women might be questionable due to large variations in the differences between DXA and each device in this study.
