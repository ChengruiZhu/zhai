The treatment of choice in cases of avulsed permanent teeth is the immediate reimplantation. However, this conduct does not always work favorably, either by failures in the initial approach or by inappropriate interventions. In this sense, the aim of this study is to present an alternative prosthetic rehabilitation with the use of orthodontic mini-implants in the anterior region. This case reports a ten-year-old child with history of avulsion of superior central incisors. The therapeutic approach was planned to promote physiological teeth contacts and acceptable esthetics and phonetics. First, the occlusal-gingival insertion of two orthodontic mini-implants was performed in the alveolar ridge, and, immediately after that, two provisional crowns were attached to the implants. The interventions achieved satisfactory cosmetic and functional results. After one-year follow-up, the adjacent periodontal tissues remained without signs and/or symptoms of inflammation. The provisional crowns presented no mobility and fractures. During radiographic examination, a healthy bone tissue appearance was observed. The simplicity of mini-implant installation makes them a promising alternative for temporary prosthetic rehabilitation of patients undergoing growth and development. The technique provides positive aesthetic and functional results that may reflect on self-esteem and social inclusion of children and adolescents.
