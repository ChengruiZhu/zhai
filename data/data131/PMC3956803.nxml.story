 laser and 1,064 nm Nd:YAG laser therapy are used, but as the wavelength is not specific to apocrine glands, these laser therapies have certain limitations. Recently, a 1,444 nm wavelength Accusculpt™ laser (LutronicCorp., Seoul, Korea) has been developed which is now commonly used for facial fat plasty and laser liposuction therapy. The use of this laser for bromhidrosis therapy targeting apocrine sweat glands is currently being discussed. Still, no studies on practical clinical use and side effects of this 1,444 nm wavelength laser have been published. In this report, we treated one bromhidrosis patient with 1,444 nm wavelength Accusculpt™ laser therapy on one side while conventional surgery was performed on the other side using a modified Inaba's method. We compared the efficacy of this laser therapy to the surgical modality by measuring malodor severity and overall satisfaction by questionnaire. We also checked for other complications and recurrence for 12 months after the treatment. This patient was largely satisfied as it has a much shorter down time with the same therapeutic outcome. As subdermal coagulation treatment by 1,444 nm Nd:YAG laser may be less invasive but effective therapy, we would like to recommend this modality as a possible treatment option.
