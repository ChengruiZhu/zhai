Inactivation of a dihydropyridine-sensitive calcium current was studied in a cell line (A7r5) derived from smooth muscle of the rat thoracic aorta. Inactivation is faster with extracellular Ca2+ than with Ba2+. In Ba2+, inactivation increases monotonically with depolarization. In Ca2+, inactivation is related to the amount of inward current, so that little inactivation is seen in Ca2+ for brief depolarizations approaching the reversal potential. Longer depolarizations in Ca2+ reveal two components of inactivation, the slower component behaving like that observed in Ba2+. Furthermore, lowering extracellular Ca2+ slows inactivation. These results are consistent with the coexistence of two inactivation processes, a slow voltage-dependent inactivation, and a more rapid current-dependent inactivation which is observable only with Ca2+. Ca(2+)-dependent inactivation is decreased but not eliminated when intracellular Ca2+ is buffered by 10 mM BAPTA, suggesting that Ca2+ acts at a site on or near the channel. We also studied recovery from inactivation after either a short pulse (able to produce significant inactivation only in Ca2+) or a long pulse (giving similar inactivation with either cation). Surprisingly, recovery from Ca(2+)-dependent inactivation was voltage dependent. This suggests that the pathways for recovery from inactivation are similar regardless of how inactivation is generated. We propose a model where Ca(2+)- and voltage-dependent inactivation occur independently.
