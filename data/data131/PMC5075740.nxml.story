Hepatocellular cancer (HCC) is increasing dramatically in incidence in Europe and the United States due mainly to the hepatitis C epidemic and, to a lesser extent, increased body mass index of the population. In the fairly recent past, HCC was largely considered as untreatable due to detection mainly at late stages and lack of effective drugs for treatment. Several advances have led to changes in the prognosis of HCC. Screening of high-risk populations has allowed for earlier detection in some studies. If found at an early stage, liver transplantation not only cures the usual underlying cirrhosis but has cure rates for HCC in the range of 60% in recent series. Larger lesions can sometimes be cured by partial hepatic resection assuming the remaining liver is not too damaged to sustain liver functions after surgery. Vaccination for hepatitis B has led to reduction in the incidence of HCC. Significant improvements in antiviral treatments for both hepatitis B and hepatitis C may be having an impact on the incidence of HCC as well. It is still generally held that a finding of metastases precludes cure of HCC. We here report the case of a patient who presented with a large HCC in the context of occult hepatitis C infection. The primary tumor was resected. Over a year later, he developed a lung metastasis that was resected as well. He has not shown recurrence for 6 years since the metastasectomy. We review the recent literature on resection of lung metastases from HCC.
