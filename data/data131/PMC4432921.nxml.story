 adipogenesis of human adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells (hADSCs). The level of miR-204-5p was shown to be gradually upregulated during adipocytic differentiation, together with the mRNA expression of the critical adipogenic transcription factors, cytidine-cytidine-adenosine-adenosine-thymidine (CCAAT) enhancer binding protein α (C/EBPα) and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPARγ), and the mature adipogenic marker, fatty acid binding protein 4 (FABP4). We further demonstrate that while the overexpression of miR-204-5p promotes adipogenesis, its knockdown causes the inhibition of this process. We then used bioinformatics tools and luciferase reporter assay to establish that dishevelled segment polarity protein 3 (DVL3), a key regulator of the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway, is a direct target of miR-204-5p. In addition, the overexpression of DVL3 led to an increase in β-catenin and cyclin D1 (CCND1) expression and, by contrast, the knockdown of DVL3 led to a decrease in the expression of β-catenin and CCND1. The knockdown of DVL3 significantly promoted adipogenesis. Finally, we demonstrated that the overexpression of miR-204-5p induced the downregulation of β-catenin and the canonical Wnt target gene, CCND1, in mature adipoctyes, while its knockdown led to their upregulation. Taken together, our data suggest that miR-204-5p regulates adipogenesis by controlling DVL3 expression and subsequently inhibiting the activation of the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway.
