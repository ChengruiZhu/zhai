Recent studies have shown that matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) might be a biomarker for predicting outcomes of bladder cancer. However, the prognostic value of overexpression of MMPs in bladder cancer is debatable and the studies are inconsistent. Therefore, this meta-analysis was performed to clarify the specific association and prognostic value of overexpression of MMPs in bladder carcinoma. Relevant studies were identified by searching PubMed, EMBASE, and the Web of Science. Pooled hazard ratios (HRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for disease-specific survival (DSS), overall survival (OS), disease/recurrence-free survival (DFS/RFS), and progression/metastasis-free survival (PFS/MFS) were analyzed to determine the prognostic value of MMPs. In total, eighteen applicable studies were included in this meta-analysis. We found that high expression of MMPs significantly correlated with a poor DSS and OS (HR=1.66; 95% CI = 1.38–2.01 and HR= 1.67; 95%CI= 1.26–2.22). MMPs also predicted tumor progression and metastasis with a pooled HR of 3.03 (95% CI 1.98–4.64). However, high MMPs expression had no pivotal impact on DFS/RFS (HR= 1.21; 95% CI= 0.96–1.53). With the purpose of better understanding the prognostic role of MMPs in patients wirh bladder carcinoma, we carried out this systematic review and meta-analysis.
