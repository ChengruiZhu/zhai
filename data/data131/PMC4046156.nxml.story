Analyses of our array data revealed distinct clusters of differentially expressed miRNAs that are specific to promyelocytes and granulocytes. While the roles of many of these miRNAs in granulopoiesis are not currently known, anti-correlation of the expression of miRNA/mRNA target pairs identified a suite of novel target genes. Clusters of miRNAs (including members of the let-7 and miR-17-92 families) are downregulated in hemopoietic stem/progenitor cells, potentially allowing the expression of target genes known to facilitate stem cell proliferation and homeostasis. Additionally, four miRNAs (miR-709, miR-706, miR-690 and miR-467a*) were found to be enriched in the nucleus of myeloid cells and multiple hemopoietic cell lines compared to other miRNAs, which are predominantly cytoplasmic-enriched. Both miR-709 and miR-706 are nuclear-enriched throughout granulopoiesis and have putative binding sites of extensive complementarity downstream of pri-miRNAs. Nuclear enrichment of miR-467a* is specific to hemopoietic stem/progenitors and promyelocytes. These miRNAs are also nuclear-enriched in other hemopoietic cell lines, where nuclear sequestering may fine-tune the expression of cytoplasmic mRNA targets.
