Red blood cell distribution width (RDW), a parameter that used to differentiate the type of anemia for several decades, recent studies suggest it was a prognostic factor in various types of cancer patients. However, the prognostic value of RDW in cancer patients remains controversial. Here, we performed a meta-analysis and systematic review to evaluate the prognostic value of RDW in cancer patients. Relevant studies were picked out from the databases of Web of Science, Embase, Pubmed and Cochrane Library. A total of 16 papers with 4267 patients were included in this meta-analysis, and the combined results indicated that elevated RDW was associated with poor over survival (OS) (HR = 1.47, 95%CI:1.29-1.66), poor cancer-specific survival (CSS) (HR = 1.46, 95%CI:1.08-1.85), poor disease-free survival (DFS) (HR = 1.91, 95%CI:1.27-2.56), poor event-free survival (EFS) (HR = 2.98, 95%CI:0.57-5.39) and poor progress-free survival (PFS) (HR = 3.21, 95%CI:0.33-6.75) after treatment. Furthermore, the similar results were observed in subgroup analysis stratified by cancer type, cutoff value of RDW, sample size and ethnicity. In conclusion, this meta-analysis demonstrated that RDW may be a potential prognostic marker in patients with cancer, and high RDW may also be associated with poor outcomes.
