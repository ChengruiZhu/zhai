Secreted protein acidic and rich in cysteine (SPARC) is associated with the progression of numerous types of cancer. However, the role of SPARC in the progression of cervical cancer has not yet been adequately elucidated. In the current study, reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) and immunohistochemistry were employed to evaluate the mRNA and protein expression of SPARC in normal cervical tissue, cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) and cervical cancer. In addition, three epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) markers (E-cadherin, N-cadherin and vimentin) were detected by immunohistochemistry in the same specimens, and an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay was conducted to detect the serum levels of SPARC in patients with cervical neoplasia. In highly invasive subclones of human cervical carcinoma cells, HeLa-1 and SiHa-1, lentiviral transfections were performed and RT-qPCR and western blot were used to investigate the effects of downregulated EGF-containing fibulin-like extracellular matrix protein 1 on the expression of E-cadherin, N-cadherin and vimentin. The results revealed that, in cervical carcinoma tissue, SPARC expression was significantly upregulated in a manner that positively correlated with N-cadherin and vimentin expression, and negatively correlated with E-cadherin expression. SPARC overexpression and high serum levels were significantly associated with the progression of cervical cancer and adverse prognosis of cervical cancer patients. Downregulation of SPARC can markedly reduce the expression of N-cadherin and vimentin and increase the expression of E-cadherin. Thus, overexpression of SPARC is significantly associated with poor prognostic clinicopathological characteristics in cervical carcinoma, and may be important in EMT. The results of the current study suggest that SPARC may be a potential therapeutic option for individuals diagnosed with cervical carcinoma.
