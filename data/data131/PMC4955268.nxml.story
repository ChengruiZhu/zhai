 As highlighted in this systematic review, medication use is common during the postpartum period often creating difficulty for mothers. Several studies illustrate the negative impact medication has on breastfeeding, initiation and duration despite reassuring advice from health professionals. Current data only describe the use of medication and behavior adopted by mothers when medication is prescribed. The factors influencing maternal behaviors have not been studied. Behaviors depend on knowledge, representations and attitudes. To better understand the behaviors of mothers faced with medication, we conducted a qualitative study, utilizing semi-structured interviews to investigate knowledge, risk perception and difficulties women experienced. The study consisted of a description and comparison of the perceived needs of two populations: 19 breastfeeding mothers and 12 health professionals. Divergences between the two populations were highlighted, focusing specifically, on knowledge needed by the women. This commentary is intended to highlight the need for further research essential to explain the influences on maternal behavior when medication is a consideration, allowing health professionals to better help mothers deal with these situations frequently affecting their breastfeeding plans.
