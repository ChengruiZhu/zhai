Ia molecules expressed by an HLA-DRw6 homozygous cell line were immunoprecipitated with anti-Ia allosera and monoclonal antibodies and analyzed by 2-D gel electrophoresis. The DRw6 homozygous cell line was shown to express two DS beta chains; this observation extends our previous finding that a DR5 homozygous cell line expresses two DS beta chains and suggests that the expression of at least two DS beta chains by DR homozygous cell lines is a generalized phenomenon. The data presented here document for the first time that a DR homozygous cell line expresses at least two DS alpha chains. Therefore, this cell line expresses at least two DS molecules with the potential for the expression of four DS molecules. In agreement with previous reports, the cell line was shown to express two DR beta chains and one DR alpha chain that combine to form two DR molecules. The molecular specificities of two MB1 allosera and two MB1 -like monoclonal antibodies were also compared in these studies. Both MB1 allosera isolated a single DS molecule, while the MB1 -like monoclonal antibodies isolated at least two DS molecules. Therefore, these studies document for the first time that anti-Ia reagents which are specific for the MB1 or MB1 -like determinants in population studies do not recognize the same Ia molecules in immunochemical studies. The data presented here for the expression of at least two DS alpha chains and the location of the MB1 allodeterminant on only one of multiple DS molecules are in agreement with recent studies at the gene level.
