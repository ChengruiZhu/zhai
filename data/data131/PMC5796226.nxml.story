To overcome the drawbacks of conventional drug delivery system, nanoemulsion have been developed as an advanced form for improving the delivery of active ingredients. However, safety evaluation is crucial during the development stage before the commercialization. Therefore, the aim of this study was to evaluate the cytotoxicity of two types of newly developed nanoemulsions. Turmeric extract-loaded nanoemulsion powder-10.6 (TE-NEP-10.6, high content of artificial surfactant Tween 80), which forms the optimal nanoemulsion, and the TE-NEP-8.6 made by increasing the content of natural emulsifier (lecithin) to reduce the potential toxicity of nanoemulsion were cultured with various cells (NIH3T3, H9C2, HepG2, hCPC, and hEPC) and the changes of each cell were observed followed by nanoemulsion treatment. As a result, the two nanoemulsions (TE-NEP-10.6 and TE-NEP-8.6) did not show significant difference in cell viability. In the case of cell line (NIH3T3, H9C2, and HepG2), toxicity was not observed at an experimental concentration of less than 1 mg/mL, however, the cell survival rate decreased in a concentration dependent manner in the case of primary cultured cells. These results from our study can be used as a basic data to confirm the cell type dependent toxicity of nanoemulsion.
