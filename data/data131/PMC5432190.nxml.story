Elucidating the differences between cancer evolutionary patterns among patients is valuable in personalized medicine, since therapeutic response mostly depends on cancer evolution process. Recently, computational methods have been extensively studied to reconstruct a cancer evolutionary pattern within a patient, which is visualized as a so-called “cancer evolutionary tree” constructed from multi-regional sequencing data. However, there have been few studies on comparisons of a set of cancer evolutionary trees to better understand the relationship between a set of cancer evolutionary patterns and patient phenotypes. Given a set of tree objects for multiple patients, we propose an unsupervised learning approach to identify subgroups of patients through clustering the respective cancer evolutionary trees. Using this approach, we effectively identified the patterns of different evolutionary modes in a simulation analysis, and also successfully detected the phenotype-related and cancer type-related subgroups to characterize tree structures within subgroups using actual datasets. We believe that the value and impact of our work will grow as more and more datasets for the cancer evolution of patients become available.
