 environment and is being used widely in the field of medical and biological research. It has been demonstrated that cancer cells cultured in 3D matrices are more radioresistant compared with cells in monolayer (2D). However, the mechanisms causing this difference remain largely unclear. Here we found that the cell cycle distribution and expression of cell cycle regulation genes in 3D A549 cells are different from the 2D. The higher levels of the promotor methylation of cell cycle regulation genes such as RBL1 were observed in 3D A549 cells compared with cells in 2D. The treatments of irradiation or 5-Aza-CdR activated the demethylation of RBL1 promotor and resulted in the increased expression of RBL1 only in 3D A549 cells. Inhibition of RBL1 enhanced the radioresistance and decreased the G2/M phase arrest induced by irradiation in 2D A549 and MCF7 cells. Overexpression of RBL1 sensitized 3D cultured A549 and MCF7 cells to irradiation. Taken together, to our knowledge, it is the first time to revealthat the low expression of RBL1 due to itself promotor methylation in 3D cells enhances the radioresistance. Our finding sheds a new light on understanding the features of the 3D cultured cell model and its application in basic research into cancer radiotherapy and medcine development.
