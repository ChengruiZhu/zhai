The effect of low-dose radiation on cells and tissues is a public health concern, because the human population is exposed to low-dose ionizing radiation coming from a variety of sources, such as cosmic rays, soil radioactivity, environmental contaminations, and various medical procedures. At low doses of radiation, phenomena are observed that do not occur at higher doses, such as radioadaptive responses as well as low-dose hyper-radiosensitivity (HRS) and increased radioresistance (IRR), which are so far not fully understood. Each of these phenomena have been investigated separately, and specific mechanisms have been suggested to explain them. Using mathematical models that are successfully fitted to experimental data under a variety of conditions, we show that a set of basic and documented assumptions about cellular responses to low-dose radiation can explain all three low-dose phenomena, indicating that they are inter-related. According to the model, these phenomena are brought about by the multi-factorial interactions that underlie the population dynamics of the cells involved, and this provides a new framework to understand these responses, and to evaluate the risk to human health posed by exposure to low-dose radiation.
