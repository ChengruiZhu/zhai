The relationship between miR-21 and miR-182 gene expression in peripheral blood and gastric cancer tissue was investigated, exploring the relationship between the levels of miR-21 and miR-182 and prognosis of gastric cancer patients, and determining the effects of these two genes on the growth and migration of gastric cancer cells. Fifty gastric cancer patients who were treated in the 254th Hospital of PLA, from July 2012 to July 2014 were selected. Peripheral blood samples were drawn from patients, and 50 healthy subjects were studied as controls. The levels of the miR-21 and miR-182 genes were detected by semi-quantitative PCR, and the correlation between miR-21 and miR-182 expression and clinicopathological features was explored. Moreover, the effects of miR-21 and miR-182 expression on the survival time and prognosis of patients were investigated. siRNA was used to downregulate miR-21 and miR-182 gene expression in MGC-803 gastric cancer cells, and MTT and Transwell assays were conducted. As a result, the relative expression levels of miR-21 and miR-182 in peripheral blood of gastric cancer patients were significantly higher than in healthy subjects (p<0.01) and the relative expression of miR-182 was closely related to the clinicopathological features of gastric cancer patients (p<0.05); high expression of miR-21 and miR-182 was associated with reduced survival time of patients (p<0.05); MGC-803 cells with low expression of miR-21 and miR-182 were analyzed, showing that miR-182 promoted cell proliferation and migration (p<0.01). In conclusion, the relative levels of miR-21 and miR-182 in peripheral blood of patients with gastric cancer are significantly increased; low expression of miR-182 can significantly reduce the proliferation and migration of gastric cancer cells. Moreover, miR-182 expression, which is closely related to the clinicopathological features of gastric cancer, can serve as a target for the clinical treatment of gastric cancer.
