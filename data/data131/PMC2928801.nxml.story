Almost all living organisms deteriorate with time through the process of aging or senescence. Because most studies on senescence examined organisms possessing a juvenile state, it was thought that bacteria, which reproduce by producing two apparently identical daughter cells, were immortal and not senescent. Recent studies have demonstrated that bacteria senesce because one daughter is allocated a larger share of the mother's load of non-genetic damage. Nonetheless, it is still equivocal whether bacterial senescence renders them mortal. I have developed a model that demonstrates that bacteria can be immortal if they experience damage below a threshold rate. A fit of the model to data shows that bacteria grown under standard laboratory conditions are immortal because they encounter a rate below the threshold. Because bacteria often experience higher damage rates in nature, it is likely that bacteria are generally mortal. The allocation of more damage to one daughter and the resulting mortality is the price bacteria pay to survive higher damage rates. These results suggest that senescence originated with the evolution of the first single-celled organisms and that it is ancestral in all multicellular organisms.
