Although dysregulation of microRNAs (miRNAs/miRs) is a common feature of human malignancies, its involvement in gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs) is not fully understood. The present study aimed to identify the miRNAs that perform a role in GIST metastasis. miRNA expression profiles from a series of 32 primary GISTs were analyzed using microarrays, and miR-186 was observed to be downregulated in tumors exhibiting metastatic recurrence. Reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction analysis of an independent cohort of 100 primary GISTs revealed that low miR-186 expression is associated with metastatic recurrence and a poor prognosis. Inhibition of miR-186 in GIST-T1 cells promoted cell migration. Gene expression microarray analysis demonstrated that miR-186 inhibition upregulated a set of genes implicated in cancer metastasis, including insulin-like growth factor-binding protein 3, AKT serine/threonine kinase 2, hepatocyte growth factor receptor, CXC chemokine receptor 4 and epidermal growth factor-containing fibulin-like extracellular matrix protein 1. These results suggest that the downregulation of miR-186 is involved in the metastatic recurrence of GISTs, and that miR-186 levels could potentially be a predictive biomarker for clinical outcome.
