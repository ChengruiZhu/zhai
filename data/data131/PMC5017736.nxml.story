Meiosis is a type of cell division, that generates haploid gametes and is essential for sexual reproduction. During meiosis, telomeres cluster on a small region of the nuclear periphery, forming a conserved chromosome arrangement referred to as the “bouquet”. Because the bouquet arrangement facilitates homologous chromosome pairing, which is essential for proper meiotic chromosome segregation, it is of great importance to understand how the bouquet arrangement is formed. In fission yeast, the bouquet arrangement requires switching of telomere and centromere positions. During mitosis, centromeres are located at the fungal centrosome called the spindle pole body (SPB). Upon entering meiosis, telomeres cluster at the SPB, and centromeres become detached from the SPB, forming the bouquet arrangement. In this study, we show that centromere detachment is linked with telomere clustering. When telomere clustering was inhibited, centromere detachment was also inhibited. This regulatory relationship depended on a conserved telomere component, Taz1, and microtubules. Furthermore, we show that the regulatory relationship is crucial for proper meiotic divisions when telomere clustering is defective. Our findings reveal a hitherto unknown regulatory relationship between meiotic telomere and centromere positions in bouquet formation, which secures proper meiotic divisions.
