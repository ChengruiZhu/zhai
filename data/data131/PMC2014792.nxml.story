Living cells continually have to respond to a changing environment. To this end, they do not only have to detect environmental signals, but also to amplify them. In living cells, signals are often amplified in so-called push-pull networks. In a push–pull network, two enzymes control the activity of a protein in an antagonistic manner. A well-known example is a network in which a kinase phosphorylates a messenger protein, while a phosphatase dephosphorylates the same protein. While it has long been assumed that the enzymes are uniformly distributed in the cytoplasm, it is increasingly becoming clear that in many systems one or both of the enzymes are localized in space, for instance near the cell pole. If the enzymes are spatially separated, then spatial gradients of the messenger protein can form, and recently a number of these protein gradients have been observed experimentally. We study by numerical calculations how the amplification properties of push–pull networks depend upon the spatial distribution of the enzymes. We find that the gain is maximized when the enzymes are either uniformly distributed or colocalized in space. Depending upon the diffusion constants, however, the sharpness of the response can be strongly reduced when the enzymes are spatially separated.
