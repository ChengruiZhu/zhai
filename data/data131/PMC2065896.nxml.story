The protein interaction network or interactome emerged as a powerful descriptor in the large-scale phenotypic studies of the post-genomic era. A major concern in such analysis is the integration of interactomic information with other phenotypic descriptors such as expression profile, co-localization, developmental phase, and large-scale proteinâ€“structure data. The latter aspect of the integration is the focus of this contribution. We investigate the molecular basis of network robustness to node failure in the most thoroughly characterized interactome, the yeast network. Node failure is by no means a random occurrence across the network as often claimed, but likely to arise in the node-proteins which are structurally the most vulnerable, that is, the ones most prone to misfolding and to form aberrant associations, including aggregates. Thus, network robustness mandates that such nodes not be directly connected, as failure in one hub is likely to induce failure in an adjacent hub. This observation led us to investigate the molecular basis for the avoidance of connections between highly central proteins and to delineate the graph topology resulting thereof. We show how this topology arose in present-day networks and how it differs from the more generic emerging topology of the ancestral network.
