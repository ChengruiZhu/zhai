The blood vasculature circulates gas, nutrients, hormones, and metabolites to all organs of the body. It is indispensable for survival and already functions at very early stages of embryonic development. At this point, new blood vessels form mainly through angiogenesisâ€”the outgrowth of new vessels from existing ones. New vascular sprouts connect to each other to form functional loops with blood flow, a process termed anastomosis. Vascular plexuses formed in this way subsequently remodel to a final structure with efficient flow patterns. Remodeling often involves pruning or regression of unnecessary branches, leading to a simplification of the network. Our in vivo live imaging studies of the pruning process in the zebrafish embryo show that vessel regression occurs through cell rearrangements, wherein cells consecutively migrate out of the pruning branch. As a result, the initially multicellular vessel is reduced to a single cell connection that is eventually resolved when the last cell incorporates into the neighboring branch. If the lumen is maintained in the pruning vessel, the process involves transient formation of a unicellular tube through cell self-fusion. Thus, we show how a variety of cellular activities are coordinated to achieve vessel pruning.
