 validation of the "Three Pack", The interobserver reliability for the "three pack" evaluation was quite strong with Kappa values between.700 to.850 for all tests, indicating substantial (.61-.80) to almost perfect (.81-1.00) agreement categories. This was in contrast to other "traditional" tests performed (Speed's, Yergason's, full and empty can tests), where only moderate agreement at best (.41-.60) was noted. Tenderness to BGP had a high sensitivity and specificity of.978 and.703 respectively for groove lesions; a positive throwing test had a moderate sensitivity of.694 and higher specificity of.745; the ACT (O'Brien Sign) had a very high sensitivity for labral tears and biceps incarceration,.897 and.914 respectively, with moderate specificities of.562 and.602 respectively. Seventy percent of patients had more than 1 site of pain and pathology confirmed at surgery. 88% of patients had a positive ACT in the symptomatic shoulder vs 11% in the unaffected shouder (and 18% of controls) for a p value<.001; 87% of patients had a positive BGP testversus 18% in the unaffected shoulder ( and 11% of controls) for a p value of <.001 as well.Seventy six percent of unaffected shoulders had all three tests negative.
