Inactivation of human SET domain containing protein 2 (SETD2) is a common event in clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC). However, the mechanism underlying loss of SETD2 function, particularly the post-transcriptional regulatory mechanism, still remains unclear. In the present study, we found that SETD2 was downregulated and inversely correlated with high expression of miR-106b-5p in ccRCC tissues and cell lines. Over-expression of miR-106b-5p resulted in the decreased mRNA and protein levels of SETD2 in ccRCC cells. In an SETD2 3â€²-UTR luciferase reporter system, miR-106b-5p downregulated the luciferase activity, and the effects were abolished by mutating the predicted miR-106b-5p binding site. Moreover, attenuation of miR-106b-5p induced cell cycle arrest at G0/G1 phase, suppressed cell proliferation, enhanced processing of caspase-3, and promoted cell apoptosis in ccRCC cells, whereas these effects were reversed upon knockdown of SETD2. In addition, transfection of miR-106b-5p antagomir resulted in the increased binding of H3K36me3 to the promoter of p53 and enhanced its activity, as well as upregulated the mRNA and protein levels of p53, and the effects were also abolished by cotransfection with si-SETD2. Collectively, our findings extend the knowledge about the regulation of SETD2 at the posttranscriptional level by miRNA and regulatory mechanism downstream of SETD2 in ccRCC.
