The prevalence and regulation of p38 mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK) expression in human lymphomas have not been extensively studied. In order to elucidate the role of p38 MAPK in lymphomagenesis, we examined the expression of native and phosphorylated p38 (p-p38) MAPK in cell lines derived from human hematopoietic neoplasms including B cell lymphoma-derived cell lines using Western blot analysis. The p-p38 MAPK protein was also analyzed in 30 B cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) tissue biopsies by immunohistochemistry. Our results show that the expression of p38 MAPK was up-regulated in most of the cell lines as compared with peripheral blood lymphocytes, while the expression of p-p38 MAPK was more variable. A subset of B cell NHL biopsies showed increased expression of p-p38 MAPK relative to reactive germinal center cells. Interleukin-4 (IL-4) induced a dose-dependent increase in the expression of p-p38 MAPK (1.6- to 2.8-fold) in cell lines derived from activated B cell-like diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL) but not those from germinal center-like DLBCL. No change was seen in native p38 MAPK. The in vitro kinase activity of p38 MAPK, however, was induced (1.6- to 3.2-fold) in all five cell lines by IL-4. Quantitative fluorescent RT-PCR demonstrated that all four isoforms of p38 MAPK gene were expressed in the lymphoma cell lines, with p38γ and p38β isoforms being predominant. IL-4 stimulation increased the expression of β, γ, and δ isoforms but not α isoform in two cell lines. In conclusion, there is constitutive expression and activation of p38 MAPK in a large number of B-lymphoma-derived cell lines and primary lymphoma tissues, supportive of its role in lymphomagenesis. The differential IL-4 regulation of p38 MAPK expression in cell lines derived from DLBCL may relate to the cellular origin of these neoplasms.
