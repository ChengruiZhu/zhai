A total of 80 human maxillary central incisors with mature apices were selected. After simulation of the open apices, the teeth were divided into 4 groups (n=20) based on the mixing and placement techniques of CEM cement: group 1, manual mixing‒manual placement; group 2, manual mixing‒manual placement in association with indirect ultrasonic technique; group 3, ultrasonic mixing‒manual placement; and group 4, ultrasonic mixing‒manual placement in association with indirect ultrasonic technique. The samples were placed within gypsum sockets in which the periodontal ligament was reconstructed with polyether impression material. After placement the apical plugs, a wet piece of cotton was placed on canal orifices, followed by dressing with Cavit. The samples were incubated at 37°C and 100% relative humidity for 7 days. Then the voids between the material and root canal walls were counted with the CBCT technique. The void dimensions were scored with the following scoring system: score 1, no voids; score 2, the void size less than half of the size of the evaluated cross-section; score 3, the void size larger than half of the size of the evaluated cross-section. Statistical analyses were carried out with chi-squared and Fisher’s exact tests. Statistical significance was defined at
