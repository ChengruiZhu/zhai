Evidence for the efficacy and safety of intravesical onabotulinum toxin A (onabotA) injections has led to them being licensed in many countries, including Korea, for the treatment of patients with urinary incontinence due to neurogenic detrusor overactivity (NDO) resulting from spinal cord injury or multiple sclerosis who are refractory or intolerant to anticholinergic medications. OnabotA injections have an inhibitory effect on acetylcholine release for up to 10 months, with a recommended dose of 200 U. OnabotA treatment has a beneficial effect not only on urinary symptoms, but also on quality of life. Several clinical studies have shown onabotA to have better effects than placebo in achieving continence, reducing incontinence episodes, improving urodynamic parameters, and improving health-related quality of life. Urinary tract infections and postvoid residual volume are the most prevalent side effects. In patients with residual volume, clean intermittent catheterization may be necessary. In patients with spinal cord injury or multiple sclerosis, it is recommended to evaluate physical and cognitive function before intravesical onabotA injection to ensure that the patient and caregiver are able to perform catheterization if necessary. Further controlled trials should assess the optimal dose, injection technique, long-term safety of repeated injections, and optimal timing of onabotA treatment in the treatment of NDO.
