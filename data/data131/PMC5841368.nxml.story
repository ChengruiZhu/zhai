Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs), which are important functional regulators in cancer, have received increased attention in recent years. In this study, next-generation sequencing technology was used to identify aberrantly expressed lncRNAs in follicular thyroid carcinoma (FTC). The long non-coding RNAâ€“HLA complex P5 (HCP5) was found to be overexpressed in FTC. The results of the qPCR analysis were consistent with the sequencing results. In addition, functional experiments showed that overexpression of HCP5 can promote the proliferation, migration, invasiveness and angiogenic ability of FTC cells. Furthermore, according to the sequencing results, HCP5 and alpha-2, 6-sialyltransferase 2 (ST6GAL2) were co-expressed in FTC. We hypothesised that ST6GAL2 may be regulated by HCP5, which would in turn mediate the activity of FTC cells. Through qPCR, immunostaining analyses and functional experiments, we determined that the expression of HCP5 was elevated and was correlated with the levels of ST6GAL2 in FTC tissues and cells. Mechanistic experiments showed that HCP5 functions as a competing endogenous RNA (ceRNA) and acts as a sponge for miR-22-3p, miR-186-5p and miR-216a-5p, which activates ST6GAL2. In summary, our study revealed that HCP5 is a tumour regulator in the development of FTC and that it may contribute to improvement of FTC diagnosis and therapy.
