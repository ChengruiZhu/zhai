The effects of external Ca ion on K channel properties were studied in squid giant axons. Increasing the Ca concentration from 20 to 100 mM slowed K channel opening, and was kinetically equivalent to decreasing the depolarizing step by approximately 25 mV. The same Ca increase had a much smaller effect on closing kinetics, equivalent to making the membrane potential more negative by approximately mV. With regard to the conductance-voltage curve, this Ca increase was about equivalent to decreasing the depolarizing step by approximately 10 mV. The presence of K or Rb in the bath slowed closing kinetics and made the time course more complex: there were pronounced slow components in Rb and, to a lesser extent, in K. Increasing the Ca concentration strongly antagonized the slowing caused by Rb or K. Thus, Ca has a strong effect on closing kinetics only in the presence of these monovalent cations. Rb and K do not significantly alter opening kinetics, nor do they alter Ca's ability to slow opening kinetics. High Ca slightly affects the instantaneous I-V curve by selectively depressing inward current at negative voltages. The results imply that Ca has two actions on K channels, and in only one, the action on closing, does it compete with monovalent cations. We propose (a) that opening kinetics are slowed by binding of Ca to negatively charged parts of the gating apparatus that are at the external surface of the channel protein when the channel is closed; monovalent cations do not compete effectively in this action; (b) Ca (or possibly Mg) normally occupies closed channels and has a latching effect. External K or Rb competes with Ca for channel occupancy. Channels close sluggishly when occupied by a monovalent cation and tend to reopen. Thus, slow closing results from occupancy by K or Rb instead of Ca. The data are well fit by a model based on these ideas.
