 cells was investigated under laminar flow conditions. Such a dynamic approach demonstrated increased adhesion to bare and mucin-coated polystyrene for IBB477, compared to that observed for the MG1820 control strain. To identify potential genetic determinants giving adhesive properties to IBB477, the improved high-quality draft genome sequence comprising chromosome and five plasmids was obtained and analysed. The number of putative adhesion proteins was determined on the basis of surface/extracellular localisation and/or the presence of adhesion domains. To identify proteins essential for the IBB477 specific adhesion property, nine deletion mutants in chromosomal genes have been constructed and analysed using adhesion tests on bare polystyrene as well as mucin-, fibronectin- or collagen IV-coated polystyrene plates in comparison to the wild-type strain. These experiments demonstrated that gene AJ89_07570 encoding a protein containing DUF285, MucBP and four Big_3 domains is involved in adhesion to bare and mucin-coated polystyrene. To summarise, in the present work, we characterised the adhesion of IBB477 under laminar flow conditions; identified the putative adherence factors present in IBB477, which is the first
