Previous studies have reported that basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) is associated with tumor genesis, growth and prognosis. The present study was conducted to detect the levels of bFGF expression in women with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), colon cancer, breast cancer and melanoma, and analyze its association with the clinicopathological characteristics of malignant tumors. The tumor tissues were obtained from 508 female patients with malignant tumors between March 2008 and May 2015 (103 NSCLC, 147 colon cancer, 206 breast cancer and 52 melanoma). Histological examination was performed on paraffin-embedded tissues. The immunohistochemical peroxidase-conjugated streptavidin method was used to detect bFGF protein expression in the tissues. The level of bFGF protein expression was significantly increased in patients with NSCLC with poor differentiation and lymph node metastasis compared with patients with moderately/well differentiated NSCLC without lymph node metastasis. Increased levels of bFGF protein expression were observed in patients with colon cancer with lymph node metastasis compared with patients without lymph node metastasis, and in patients with breast cancer with tumor-node-metastasis stage III–IV and lymph node metastasis compared with patients in stage I–II and without lymph node metastasis. The rate of positive bFGF staining in patients with melanoma with lymph node metastasis was significantly higher compared with patients without lymph node metastasis. These results suggested that bFGF may be associated with the process of malignant tumor genesis and growth, and the expression of bFGF protein may be a potential and effective biomarker for diagnosing malignant tumor metastasis in females. The present study may also provide theoretical bases for the clinical application of bFGF monoclonal antibody in molecular targeted therapies in tumors.
