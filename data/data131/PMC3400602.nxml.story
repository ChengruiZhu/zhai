Over the last decade several relatively small synthetic gene networks have been successfully implemented and characterized, including oscillators, toggle switches, and intercellular communication systems. However, the ability to engineer large-scale synthetic gene networks for controlling multicellular systems with predictable and robust behavior remains a challenge. Here we present a novel combination of computational methods to aid the iterative design and optimization of such synthetic biological systems. We apply these methods to the design and analysis of an artificial tissue homeostasis system that exhibits coordinated control of cellular proliferation, differentiation, and cell-death. Achieving artificial tissue homeostasis would be therapeutically relevant for diseases such as Type I diabetes, for instance by transplanting genetically engineered stem cells that stably maintain populations of insulin-producing beta-cells despite normal cell death and autoimmune attacks. To manage complexity in the design process, we employ principles of logic abstraction and modularity and investigate their limits in biological networks. In this work, we find factors often associated with robustness (e.g., multicellular synchronization and noise attenuation) to be actually detrimental, and overcome these problems by engineering genetic modules that generate beneficial population heterogeneity. A combination of computational methods elucidates how these modules function to enhance robust control, and provides guidance for experimental implementation.
