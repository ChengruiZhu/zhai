Lipid metabolism plays an important role in the development of metabolic syndrome, a major risk factor for cardiovascular disease and diabetes. Furthermore, inborn errors in lipid oxidation cause rare, but severe diseases in children. To obtain more insight into the response of lipid oxidation to dietary and medical interventions, we constructed a computational model. The model correctly simulated the rate of lipid oxidation and the time courses of most acyl carnitines. The latter are used as diagnostic markers in blood. Subsequently, we subjected the model to an increased supply of lipids, as often happens in obese people. We discovered that the lipid-oxidation machinery easily becomes overloaded, very much like a highway during rush hours: the more cars enter the road, the slower they proceed and the more they clog the road. Analogously, an overload of lipids slowed down the lipid oxidation and led to an accumulation of intermediate metabolites in the pathway. Potential protection mechanisms of cells consist of restricted entry of lipids into the oxidation pathway or efficient downstream processing of reaction products. In future research we will use the model to test dietary or medical interventions
