Host–virus interactions are a classic example of genetic conflict in which both entities try to gain an evolutionary advantage over the other. This “back-and-forth” evolution is predicted to result in rapid changes of both host and viral proteins, which results in an evolutionary signature of positive selection, especially at the direct interaction interface. Recent studies have demonstrated that host proteins can target intracellular stages of the viral life cycle to potently inhibit viruses. Collectively, these host proteins are referred to as “intrinsic immunity” proteins. One such protein, zinc-finger antiviral protein (ZAP), was previously described from rats and shown to inhibit retroviruses and alphaviruses. We queried the primate orthologs of ZAP to ascertain both whether they have evolved under positive selection, and whether they have antiviral activity. We found that the signature of positive selection was restricted to a poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase–like domain in a longer isoform of primate ZAP. The longer human ZAP isoform has increased antiviral activity against both retroviruses and alphaviruses. Thus, positive selection correctly predicted the more potent antiviral isoform of this protein.
