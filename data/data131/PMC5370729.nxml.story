The translation and cultural adaptation were performed according to international recommendations. In the first stage, 2 Turkish individuals with a good command of English were responsible for the literal and conceptual translation of the VISA-P. The informed translator was a physical therapist, and the uninformed translator was a teacher. Both translators were fluent in English and spoke Turkish as their mother tongue. The translations were completed independently. In the second stage, both translations were compared and reviewed by a bilingual individual who highlighted any conceptual errors or inconsistencies in the translations to establish the first Turkish translation. In the third stage, after the first Turkish translation was agreed upon, 2 native English speakers with a good command of Turkish separately translated the finalized Turkish translation back into English. In the fourth stage, the back-translated version of the VISA-P was compared to the initial English version of the VISA-P. The committee evaluated the 4 translations and compared the discrepancies. After discussing the discrepancies, the committee finalized and approved the Turkish version of the VISA-P. In the final stage, prelimi-nary testing was performed. with 22 patients and 40 healthy participants to determine comprehension of the Turkish version.
