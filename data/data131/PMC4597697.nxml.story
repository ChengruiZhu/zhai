As patellar osteochondral fractures usually occur following acute dislocation of patella, rarely may occur without dislocation. We could find 2 cases in the literature which aren't accompanied by dislocation of patella. One of them is a non-displaced fracture and the other one is an osteochondral fragment with 15x20 mm in size which was resected due to inconformity. Eighty percent of acute dislocations of patella are accompanied by contusions on lateral femoral condyle and intraarticular fragments are present in 11 to 74 percent of cases. In this article we present 13 year-old male patient with an osteochondral fracture in the inferior of medial marge of patella without dislocation of patella, which was displaced into joint space and accompanied by a chondral lesion on the lateral femoral condyle, and then treated by artroscopical reduction and fixation. Our case seems to be original due to occuring without dislocation of patella and being the first case treated by arthroscopical intervention. Displaced and intraarticular patellar osteochondral fractures should be replaced and fixed by surgically. We consider that when compared with open joint surgery, arthroscopical replacement and fixation of osteochondral fractures causes lower morbidity and helps to improve rehabilitation of the patient.
