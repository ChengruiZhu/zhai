Cells have evolved complex stress responses to cope with environmental challenges that could otherwise inflict severe damage on the molecules essential for life. Stress responses must ameliorate the immediate damage caused by stress exposure and also adjust metabolic capacity, gene expression output, and other cellular functions to protect against further damage that could be incurred by prolonged exposure to stress. Posttranslational protein modifications are a major means by which cells respond to changing environmental conditions. These modifications can alter the function, localization, and molecular interactions of their target proteins. In addition, evidence is emerging that some posttranslational modifications may also change the physical characteristics of target proteins. In this study, we present evidence that during hyperosmotic stress, a condition known to induce protein misfolding, cells rapidly but transiently use the small ubiquitin-modifier SUMO to protect against persistent inclusion formation of a conserved transcriptional repressor complex. We propose that this rapid protective action via posttranslational modification enables optimal gene regulation during the cellular response to hyperosmotic stress.
