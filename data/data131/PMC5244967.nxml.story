The present study aimed to investigate the effects of overexpression of interferon-induced transmembrane protein 5 (IFITM5) and IFITM5 c.-14C>T mutation on osteogenic differentiation, and the proliferation, migration and invasion of SaOS2 cells. SaOS2 cells were transfected with plasmids containing wild type IFITM5 (W) or IFITM5 containing the c.-14C>T mutation (MU). The mRNA and protein expression levels of IFITM5 in SaOS2 cells were respectively detected by reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction and western blotting. The proliferative, migratory and invasive ability of SaOS2 cells was also examined. In addition, the expression levels of osteogenic differentiation markers alkaline phosphatase (ALP), osteocalcin (OCN) and runt-related transcription factor 2 (Runx2) were detected. Mineralized nodules were detected by Alizarin Red S staining and were quantified by measuring absorbance. The mRNA and protein expression levels of IFITM5 were high in cells transfected with IFITM5 and IFITM5 c.-14C>T mutation, and were higher in cells transfected with IFITM5 c.-14C>T mutation. There was no difference in proliferation between the control group (C) and the W and MU groups. However, overexpression of IFITM5 and IFITM5 c.-14C>T mutation increased apoptotic rate, decreased invasive capacity, increased the expression of ALP, OCN and Runx2, and increased the number of mineralized nodules following osteogenic induction. In addition, compared with C and W groups, cells transfected with IFITM5 c.-14C>T mutation exhibited decreased migratory ability. In conclusion, overexpression of IFITM5 and IFITM5 c.-14C>T mutation promotes tumor cell apoptosis, inhibits tumor invasion and promotes osteogenic differentiation. These findings may provide a theoretical basis for the development of a novel treatment method that targets IFITM5, and provides a platform for the potential treatment of human osteosarcoma.
