. 3. An "accelerator" reagent was prepared by treating bovine serum with barium carbonate, and then passing the serum through a column of diatomaceous earth. This "accelerator" was used together with prothrombin, blood thrombokinase, Howell's cephalin, and calcium chloride to compose a five-reagent thrombin-producing system. In this system, no thrombin was produced without thrombokinase. On the other hand, thrombin was produced from prothrombin and thrombokinase, even when all the other reagents were omitted. When calcium was omitted, thrombokinase was able to function; but cephalin and the "accelerator" reagent were ineffective. 4. Quantitative tests indicated that the "accelerator" reagent exerted an effect distinct from those of thrombokinase and cephalin. However, it is not certain whether the "accelerator" reagent functioned as an accessory factor, as a potential source of more thrombokinase, or both. In the experiments reported, thrombokinase was primary to, or necessary for, the effect of "accelerator." 5. The effectiveness of thrombokinase was multiplied a hundred times or more, when complemented by calcium, cephalin, and "accelerator" reagent. Ionic calcium was a necessary component of this complementing system. This may help to explain why removal of calcium ions keeps blood fluid, even though thrombokinase, by itself, is little influenced either by calcium ions or by oxalate.
