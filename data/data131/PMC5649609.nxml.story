 was investigated. Notch1 and cleaved-Notch1 expression were evaluated in human PCa cell lines, including LNCaP, PC-3 and DU 145, and the human prostate epithelial RWPE-1 cell line. LNCaP cells were transfected with Notch1-targeting short hairpin RNAs (shRNAs) and the level of proliferation, the ability to invade and the expression of genes associated with cancer cell invasion were subsequently investigated. Notch1 was highly expressed in LNCaP, PC-3 and DU 145 cells compared with RWPE-1 cells, while cleaved-Notch1 was expressed in LNCaP, PC-3 and DU 145 cells, and only to a minimal extent in RWPE-1 cells. Knockdown of Notch1 by shRNA in LNCaP cells markedly decreased cell invasion through Matrigel and inhibited cell proliferation 48 h following transfection. Reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction analysis indicated that Notch1-knockdown resulted in a significant reduction of metastasis-associated 1 (MTA1) and increase of KiSS-1 metastasis-suppressor (KISS-1), mitogen-activated protein kinase 4 (MKK4) and cluster of differentiation 82 (KAI1). The present data demonstrated that expression of Notch1 was significantly associated with the invasion of prostate cancer. Knockdown of Notch1 decreased the invasive ability of LNCaP cells, which may be caused by downregulating MTA1 and upregulating KISS-1, MKK4 and KAI1. These findings indicated that targeting Notch1 may provide a novel method of suppressing or treating metastasis in prostate cancer.
