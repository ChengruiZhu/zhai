Sodium hyaluronate injection into the glenohumeral joint is a treatment option in the management of adhesive capsulitis of the shoulder. We hypothesized that a systematic review would demonstrate that intra-articular sodium hyaluronate injections would result in significant improvements in passive range-of-motion, shoulder and general clinical outcome measures, and pain scales at short- and mid-term follow-up. Multiple medical databases were searched for levels Iâ€“IV evidence with a priori defined specific inclusion and exclusion study criteria. Clinical outcome measures used included Constant score, VAS pain scores, Cho functional scores, JOA scores, and range-of-motion measurements. Seven studies were included (four Level I and three Level IV; 292 subjects, 297 shoulders). Mean subject age was 59.1 years and mean pre-treatment duration of symptoms was 7.3 months. 140 subjects underwent one or multiple hyaluronate injections (120 glenohumeral joint; 20 subacromial bursa). Clinical follow-up was mean 9.0 weeks. Sodium hyaluronate injection into the glenohumeral joint has significantly improved shoulder range-of-motion, constant scores, and pain at short-term follow-up following treatment of adhesive capsulitis. Isolated intra-articular hyaluronate injection has significantly better constant scores than control. Isolated intra-articular hyaluronate injection has equivalent clinical outcomes and range-of-motion compared to intra-articular corticosteroid injection. Intra-articular hyaluronate injection was safe, with no reported complications within the studies in this review. Sodium hyaluronate injection into the glenohumeral joint is a safe, effective treatment in the management of adhesive capsulitis of the shoulder. Short-term evidence indicates that clinical outcomes are better than control and equivalent to intra-articular corticosteroid injection.
