Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) and Computed Tomography (CT) are first choice imaging tools for PCC (sensitivity 90–100%). For the validation of the diagnosis or follow up, the functional imaging 123I–metaiodobenzylguanidine (MIBG) or Fluorine–18–L–dihydroxyphenylalanine (18F–DOPA) positron emission tomography (excellent specificity and sensitivity of 90–100% in detection of small tumors >1–2 cm) are used. Laparoscopic surgery with complete resection is a safe and a first choice approach. The conversion (about 5%) to direct open operation was needed for large lesions (>8 cm) with the suspicion of malignancy. Currently, there are no histological criteria for distinguishing benign and malignant tumors. The genetic testing (Sanger DNA sequencing) for hereditary syndromes (von Hippel–Lindau, neurofibromatosis, etc.) is used for prediction of malignancy and recurrence. All patients should get individual and risk–adapted genetic analysis and consultation, including family members. The rate of malignancy in ePCC is about 30% (PCC about 5–10%). In patients with proven SDHB germline mutations, higher malignancy rate, multiple PCCs and recurrences are likely. A stringent lifelong clinical follow–up is recommended in these cases. Patients with syndromic hereditary forms should be screened for other often associated neoplasms.
