With high survival rates for chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) patients treated with BCR-ABL1 tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs), emerging consequences, such as arterial ischemic events, require consideration when evaluating treatment options. Cardiovascular ischemic event incidence in clinical trials was evaluated in 2712 dasatinib-treated patients with Philadelphia chromosome-positive (Ph+) leukemias from 11 first- and second-line trials (pooled), newly diagnosed CML patients treated with dasatinib or imatinib (DASISION), and prostate cancer patients treated with dasatinib or placebo plus docetaxel/prednisone (READY). Overall, 2–4% of dasatinib-treated patients had cardiovascular ischemic events. Most dasatinib-treated patients with an event had a history of and/or risk factor for atherosclerosis (pooled 77 with history/risk and event/96 with events; DASISION 8/10; READY 15/18). Most cardiovascular ischemic events occurred within 1 year of initiating dasatinib (pooled 69/96; DASISION 7/10; READY 16/18). Comparison of observed and expected event rates through standardized incidence ratios indicates that dasatinib does not increase risk for cardiovascular ischemic events compared with external reference populations.
