Blood-borne lymphocytes extravasate in large numbers within peripheral lymph nodes (PN) and other secondary lymphoid organs. It has been proposed that the initiation of extravasation is based upon a family of cell adhesion molecules (homing receptors) that mediate lymphocyte attachment to specialized high endothelial venules (HEV) within the lymphoid tissues. A putative homing receptor has been identified by the monoclonal antibody, MEL-14, which recognizes an 80-90-kD glycoprotein on the surface of mouse lymphocytes and blocks the attachment of lymphocytes to PN HEV. In a companion study we characterize a carbohydrate-binding receptor on the surface of mouse lymphocytes that also appears to be involved in the interaction of lymphocytes with PN HEV. This receptor selectively binds to fluorescent beads derivatized with PPME, a polysaccharide rich in mannose-6-phosphate. In this report we examine the relationship between this carbohydrate-binding receptor and the putative homing receptor identified by the MEL-14 antibody. We found that: MEL-14 completely and selectively blocks the activity of the carbohydrate-binding receptor on mouse lymphocytes; the ability of six lymphoma cell lines to bind PPME beads correlates with cell-surface expression of the MEL-14 antigen, as well as PN HEV-binding activity; selection of lymphoma cell line variants for PPME-bead binding by fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) produces highly correlated (r = 0.974, P less than 0.001) and selective changes in MEL-14 antigen expression. These results show that the carbohydrate-binding receptor on lymphocytes and the MEL-14 antigen, which have been independently implicated as receptors involved in PN-specific HEV attachment, are very closely related, if not identical, molecules.
