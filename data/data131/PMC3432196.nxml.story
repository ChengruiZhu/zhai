Human tissue allografts are widely used in a variety of clinical applications with over 1.5 million implants annually in the US alone. Since the 1990s, most clinically available allografts have been disinfected to minimize risk of disease transmission. Additional safety assurance can be provided by terminal sterilization using low dose gamma irradiation. The impact of such irradiation processing at low temperatures on viruses was the subject of this study. In particular, both human tendon and cortical bone samples were seeded with a designed array of viruses and the ability of gamma irradiation to inactivate those viruses was tested. The irradiation exposures for the samples packed in dry ice were 11.6–12.9 kGy for tendon and 11.6–12.3 kGy for bone, respectively. The viruses, virus types, and log reductions on seeded tendon and bone tissue, respectively, were as follows: Human Immunodeficiency Virus (RNA, enveloped), >2.90 and >3.20; Porcine Parvovirus (DNA, non-enveloped), 1.90 and 1.58; Pseudorabies Virus (DNA, enveloped), 3.80 and 3.79; Bovine Viral Diarrhea Virus (RNA, enveloped), 2.57 and 4.56; and Hepatitis A Virus (RNA, non-enveloped), 2.54 and 2.49, respectively. While proper donor screening, aseptic technique, and current disinfection practices all help reduce the risk of viral transmission from human allograft tissues, data presented here indicate that terminal sterilization using a low temperature, low dose gamma irradiation process inactivates both enveloped and non-enveloped viruses containing either DNA or RNA, thus providing additional assurance of safety from viral transmission.
