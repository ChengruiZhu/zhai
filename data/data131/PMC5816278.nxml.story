Although tinea capitis is the most common fungal infection in children, significant changes have been reported in its epidemiology worldwide, as a result from certain geographic, climatic and cultural differences in one hand, as well as the changes in its etiologic pattern. The clinical manifestation of the infection and the stage of inflammation vary from mild desquamation to severe suppurative indurated plaques in kerion - like the pattern, depending on the nature of the etiologic agent and the host-immune response. We report a case of tinea capitis profunda, caused by Trichophyton verrucosum in a 5 – year - old male patient, presented as a severe scalp and cutaneous desquamation, resembling histopathologically psoriasis, associated with severely indurated ringworm plaque in the temporal area. The performed histological examination revealed a psoriasiform pattern, without the typical Munro abscesses or Kogoj pustules. With the presented case, we want to emphasize the importance of the host’s immune reaction to zoophilic dermatophytes, such as Trichophyton verrucosum, resulting in severe and often atypical clinical manifestation, as well as the possible “Id reaction”, to avoid or minimise misdiagnosis and delayed therapy. The presented patient was treated with topical oleum acidy salicylic 10% and Terbinafine 125 mg daily with significant resolution of the complaints within the following two months.
