Novel breast carcinoma dual-targeted redox-responsive nanoparticles (NPs) based on cholesteryl-hyaluronic acid conjugates were designed for intracellular delivery of the antitumor drug doxorubicin (DOX). A series of reduction-responsive hyaluronic acid derivatives grafted with hydrophobic cholesteryl moiety (HA-ss-Chol) and GE11 peptide conjugated HA-ss-Chol (GE11–HA-ss-Chol) were synthesized. The obtained conjugates showed attractive self-assembly characteristics and high drug loading capacity. GE11–HA-ss-Chol NPs were highly stable under conditions mimicking normal physiological conditions, while showing a fast degradation of the vehicle’s structure and accelerating the drug release dramatically in the presence of intracellular reductive environment. Furthermore, the cellular uptake assay confirmed GE11–HA-ss-Chol NPs were taken up by MDA-MB-231 cells through CD44- and epidermal growth factor receptor-mediated endocytosis. The internalization pathways of GE11–HA-ss-Chol NPs might involve clathrin-mediated endocytosis and macropinocytosis. The intracellular distribution of DOX in GE11–HA-ss-Chol NPs showed a faster release and more efficient nuclear delivery than the insensitive control. Enhanced in vitro cytotoxicity of GE11–HA-ss-Chol DOX-NPs further confirmed the superiority of their dual-targeting and redox-responsive capacity. Moreover, in vivo imaging investigation in MDA-MB-231 tumor-bearing mice confirmed that GE11–HA-ss-Chol NPs labeled with 1,1′-dioctadecyl-3,3,3′,3′-tetramethylindotricarbocyanine iodide, a near-infrared fluorescence dye, possessed a preferable tumor accumulation ability as compared to the single-targeting counterpart (HA-ss-Chol NPs). The antitumor efficacy showed an improved therapy efficacy and lower systemic side effect. These results suggest GE11–HA-ss-Chol NPs provide a good potential platform for antitumor drugs.
