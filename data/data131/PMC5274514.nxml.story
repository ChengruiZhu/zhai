Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) is one of the most common liver diseases and a major cause of liver fibrosis worldwide. Γ-Aminobutyric acid (GABA) is one of the most abundant inhibitory neurotransmitters in the central nervous system. Recently, it has been reported that GABAergic signaling pathways are found in various non-neuronal tissues including the immune system and play a functional role. In the present study, we investigated whether administration of GABA has effects on NASH through its immunomodulatory effects. To test this hypothesis, C57BL/6 mice were fed a methionine–choline-deficient (MCD) diet for 8 weeks. After four weeks into MCD feeding, mice were provided with plain water (control) or water containing 2 mg/mL of GABA for the subsequent 4 weeks. Using this MCD diet-induced NASH model, we found that mice receiving GABA showed more severe steatohepatitis and liver fibrosis than control mice. This increased liver damage was confirmed by higher levels of serum alanine transaminase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) compared to the control group. In accordance with increased liver steatohepatitis, NASH-related and inflammatory gene expression (collagen α1, tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-1, TNF-α) in the liver was markedly increased in GABA-treated mice. Furthermore, GABA directly enhanced production of inflammatory cytokines including IL-6 and TNF-α in LPS activated RAW macrophage cells and increased TIB–73 hepatocyte death. Such effects were abolished when GABA was treated with bicuculline, a competitive antagonist of GABA receptors. These results suggest that oral administration of GABA may be involved in changes of the liver immune milieu and conferred detrimental effects on NASH progression.
