Before we do anything, our brain must construct neural representations of the operations required. Imaging and recording techniques are indeed providing ever more detailed insight into how different regions of the brain contribute to behavior. However, it has remained elusive exactly how these various regions then come to cooperate with each other, thus organizing the brain-scale activity patterns needed for even the simplest planned tasks. In the present work, the authors propose a neural network model built around the hypothesis of a modular organization of brain activity, where relatively autonomous basic neural functions useful at a given moment are recruited and integrated into actual behavior. At the heart of the model are regulating structures that restrain information from flowing freely between the different cortical areas involved, releasing it instead in a controlled fashion able to produce the appropriate response. The dynamics of the network, simulated on a computer, enables it to pass simple cognitive tests while reproducing data gathered on primates carrying out these same tasks. This suggests that the model might constitute an appropriate framework for studying the neural basis of more general behavior.
