Retigeric acid B (RAB), a natural compound isolated from lichen, has been demonstrated to inhibit cell growth and promote apoptosis in prostate cancer (PCa) cells. The present study evaluated the function of RAB combined with clinical chemotherapeutic drugs in PCa cell lines by MTT assay, reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction and western blot analysis, and identified that RAB at low doses produced significant synergistic cytotoxicity in combination with cisplatin (CDDP); however, no marked synergism between RAB and the other chemotherapeutics was observed. Additional studies revealed that RAB exerted an inhibitory effect on DNA damage repair pathways, including the nucleotide excision repair and mismatch repair pathways, which are involved in the sensitivity to CDDP-based chemotherapy, as suggested by the significantly downregulated expression of certain associated repair proteins. Notably, Excision repair cross-complementing 1, a critical gene in the nucleotide excision repair pathway, exhibited the most significant decrease. When combined with CDDP, RAB-mediated impairment of DNA repair resulted in prolonged DNA damage, as demonstrated by the long-lasting appearance of phosphorylation of histone H2AX at Ser139, which potentially enhanced the chemosensitivity to CDDP. Concurrently, the proapoptotic protein death receptor 5 (DR5) was activated by RAB, which also enhanced the chemotherapeutic response of CDDP. Knockdown of DR5 partially blocked RAB-CDDP synergism, suggesting the crucial involvement of DR5 in this event. The results of the present study identified that RAB functioned synergistically with CDDP to increase the efficacy of CDDP by inhibiting DNA damage repair and activating DR5, suggesting the mechanistic basis for the antitumor effect of RAB in combination with current chemotherapeutics.
