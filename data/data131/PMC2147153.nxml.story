 Study of the stoichiometry of the DNA-methyl green reaction by dialysis, precipitation of stain-nucleic acid mixtures, and the staining of nuclei of known DNA content, indicate that the compound consists of one dye molecule per 10 P. The significance of this result was discussed in the preceding paper (1). Histone and lanthanum (and probably other multivalent cations (3)) compete with the dye for the nucleic acid molecule, indicating a common site of attachment, presumably the phosphoric acid groups. With care in the avoidance of procedures which might depolymerize DNA, and the use of a buffer at about pH 4.1, a quantitative histochemical method for DNA by the use of methyl green is possible. Pyronin staining appears to be of qualitative significance only. Slight differences in degree of polymerization, as between the shad and mammalian DNA appear to have no effect on methyl green staining. It may be that a critical level of polymerization for DNA staining exists. This level must exceed 20 nucleotides to account for the 10 P to 1 dye molecule and the effect on the methyl green absorption spectrum; but it may be considerably greater. Beyond this critical level, whatever it may be, further polymerization probably has no influence on staining.
