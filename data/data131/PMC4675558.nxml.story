Protein ubiquitylation is the covalent attachment of the small protein ubiquitin onto other proteins and is a key regulatory pathway for most biological processes. The central components of the ubiquitylation process are the E3 ligases, which recognize substrate proteins. The best-studied E3 complexes are the SCF ligases, which are composed of 3 core components—Cdc53, Skp1, Rbx1—that assemble to the functional ligase complex by binding to one of the multiple substrate adaptors—the F-box proteins. Maintaining a balanced repertoire of diverse SCF complexes that represent the entire cellular panel of substrate adapters is challenging. Depending on the cell type, hundreds of different F-box proteins can compete for the single binding site on the common SCF core complex. Rapid degradation of F-box proteins helps in maintaining a critical level of unoccupied Cdc53/Skp1/Rbx1 core, complexes and alterations in levels of F-box proteins has been linked to diseases including cancer. Studying the yeast F-box protein Met30 as a model, we have uncovered a novel mechanism for degradation of F-box proteins. This pathway targets free F-box proteins and requires part of the SCF core. These findings add an additional layer to our understanding of regulation of multisubunit E3 ligase.
