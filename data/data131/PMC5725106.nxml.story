The present studies focused on the ability of the phosphodiesterase 5 (PDE5) inhibitor sildenafil to enhance the anti-cancer properties of clinically relevant concentrations of the dietary diarylheptanoid curcumin. In gastrointestinal tumor cells, sildenafil and curcumin interacted in a greater than additive fashion to kill. Inhibition of the extrinsic apoptotic pathway suppressed killing by ∼50%, as did blockade of the intrinsic apoptotic pathway. Sildenafil and curcumin reduced mTORC1 and mTORC2 activity and increased Beclin1 levels and the numbers of autophagosomes and autolysosomes in cells in a PERK-eIF2α-dependent fashion. Knock down of Beclin1 or ATG5 partially suppressed killing. In contrast, stable knock out of ATG16-L1 unexpectedly enhanced killing, an effect not altered by Beclin1/ATG5 knock down. Curcumin and sildenafil exposure reduced the expression of MCL-1, BCL-XL, thioredoxin and superoxide dismutase 2 (SOD2) in an eIF2α-dependent fashion. Curcumin and sildenafil interacted in a greater than additive fashion to increase the levels of reactive oxygen species; knock down of thioredoxin or SOD2 enhanced killing and over-expression of thioredoxin or SOD2 suppressed killing.
