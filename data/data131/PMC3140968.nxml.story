 (MTB), the causative agent of TB, is a dramatically successful pathogen that poses a considerable challenge for modern medicine. The increase in multi-drug resistant TB necessitates the identification of novel drug targets and drugs with new mechanisms of action. In this work, we developed a novel computational strategy based on comparative proteomic analysis that can highlight proteins involved in specifies-specific functions. Our analyses of the proteins encoded by the MTB genome identified two protein families that stand out in this respect. These proteins have complex architecture combining various domains and disordered segments. They are also involved in vital functions, especially in host-pathogen interactions. Although these proteins generally do not fit into traditional drug design paradigms, there are several new strategies emerging that can be used to target these proteins during drug development. Our results challenge current target selection protocols that largely rely on the uniqueness and the essentiality of proteins. Instead, these findings emphasize the importance of complex evolutionary scenarios that can lead to the emergence of species-specific functions from more ancient building blocks of proteins. The experiences gained from this work have important implications specifically for targeting MTB, and in broader terms, to improve current target selection protocols in drug development.
