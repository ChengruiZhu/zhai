 gene. Market authorization was granted in February 2016 in Europe and December 2015 in the USA. As a potentially nephrotoxic uricosuric drug acting on the kidney, nephrologists should become familiar with its indications and safety profile. The approved indication is treatment of gout in combination with a xanthine oxidase (XO) inhibitor in adult patients who have not achieved target serum uric acid levels with an XO inhibitor alone. It is not indicated for asymptomatic hyperuricaemia or for patients with estimated creatinine clearance <45 mL/min. The only authorized daily dose is 200 mg and cannot be exceeded because of the nephrotoxicity risk. Nephrotoxicity is thought to be related to uricosuria. At the 200 mg/day dose, serum creatinine more than doubled in 1.8% of lesinurad patients (versus 0% in placebo) and in 11% of these it was not reversible. In addition, it is subject to a risk management plan given the potential association with cardiovascular events. In randomized clinical trials, the association of lesinurad with either allopurinol or febuxostat achieved a greater reduction in serum uric acid (∼1 mg/dL lower) than the XO inhibitors alone, and this allowed the serum uric acid target to be met in a higher proportion of patients, which was the primary endpoint. However, no clinical differences were observed in gout flares or tophi, although these were not the primary endpoints.
