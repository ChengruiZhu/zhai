Genetic recombination is the meiotic process by which novel combinations of alleles are passed on to the next generation. This process accelerates evolution by creating genetic diversity, and is also essential for successful meiosis. In mammals, the enzyme PRDM9 initiates recombination and determines the subset of sites within the genome—called recombination hotspots—that recombine. PRDM9 does this by binding DNA at hotspots and placing epigenetic marks. Previously, PRDM9 was only known to place the H3K4me3 mark at hotspots in living cells. Here, we show that PRDM9 places the H3K36me3 mark at hotspots, and that H3K4me3 and H3K36me3 coincide only at regions of recombination in germ cells. We prove that this coincidence is driven almost entirely by PRDM9; there is dramatically less coincidence between H3K4me3 and H3K36me3 when PRDM9 is absent. These results reveal a new enzymatic function for PRDM9, and a new epigenetic signature at hotspots that may restrict recombination to these sites. Since aberrant recombination can cause aneuploidy resulting in fetal loss, and abnormal genome rearrangements that underlie many congenital syndromes and some cancers, a thorough understanding of this fundamental process has potentially far-reaching implications.
