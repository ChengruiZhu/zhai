Regulation of metabolic activity in response to environmental and genetic perturbations is fundamental to the growth and maintenance of all cells. A primary regulatory process used by cells to control the activity of their metabolic network is the alteration in the expression of enzyme-coding genes. How these alterations regulate metabolite concentrations is an important question in the quest towards unraveling the genotype-phenotype relationship. The link between the expression levels of enzymes and metabolite concentrations is governed by the kinetics of individual reactions, which in turn are interlinked with each other due to the complex connectivity structure of metabolic networks. Although the enzyme-metabolite relationship is relatively well studied at the level of individual reactions, our understanding of the regulation of metabolite levels in complex networks has remained incomplete. In this study, we show that the constraints imposed by the network connectivity are key determinants of the relationship between gene expression and metabolite concentration changes. Our results provide mechanistic insight into the function of complex metabolic networks and have implications for health and biotechnological applications.
