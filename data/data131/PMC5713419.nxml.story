Glioblastoma, a WHO grade IV astrocytoma, is a highly aggressive and heterogeneous tumour that infiltrates deeply into surrounding brain parenchyma, making complete surgical resection impossible. Despite chemo-radiotherapy, the residual cell population within brain parenchyma post-surgery causes inevitable recurrence. Previously, the tumour core has been the focus of research and the basis for targeted therapeutic regimes, which have failed to improve survival in clinical trials. Here, we focus on the invasive margin as defined by the region with 5-aminolevulinic acid (5ALA) (GliolanTM) fluorescence at surgery beyond the T1 enhancing region on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). This area is hypothesized to constitute unique microenvironmental pressures, and consequently be molecularly distinct to tumour core and enhancing rim regions. We conducted hematoxylin and eosin (H&E), array real time polymerase chain reaction (PCR), and immunohistochemistry staining on various intra-tumour regions of glioblastoma to determine molecular heterogeneity between regions. We analyzed 73 tumour samples from 21 patients and compared cellular density, cell proliferation, and the degree of vascularity. There is a statistically significant difference between the core, invasive margin and other regions for cell density (
