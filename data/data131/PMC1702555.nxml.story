. The infection can be passed from one person to another through contact with hands and clothes, and by flies. The disease develops gradually—while children are most susceptible to infection, they may not note its effects until adulthood, when scarring from repeated infections causes the eyelashes to turn inward (“trichiasis”). The cornea—the transparent front part of the eye—becomes damaged by the eyelashes and develops ulcers, and eventually blindness results. Trachoma is most common in poor rural communities living in overcrowded conditions with limited access to water and health care. As improved living conditions, better hygiene, and early treatment of the infection with antibiotics can prevent the disease—and surgery for trichiasis is very effective—trachoma is regarded as a preventable type of blindness. It is also described as a “neglected disease”; over seven million people have trichiasis and it causes an estimated 3.6% of the world's blindness, but it does not receive the attention that such a widespread and serious condition demands. The World Health Organization recommends a strategy for trachoma control known as SAFE—surgery, antibiotics, facial cleanliness, and environmental change.
