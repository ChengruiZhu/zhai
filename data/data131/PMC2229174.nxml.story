We have investigated the interactions between extracellular divalent cations and the ATP-sensitive potassium channel in single guinea pig ventricular cells and found that, under whole-cell patch clamp recording conditions, extracellularly applied Co2+, Cd2+, and Zn2+ block current through the ATP-sensitive K channel (IKATP). The respective Kd's for block of IKATP by Cd2+ and Zn2+ are 28 and 0.46 microM. The Kd for Co2+ is > 200 microM. Extracellular Ca2+ and Mg2+ appear to have no effect at concentrations up to 1 and 2 mM, respectively. Block of IKATP by extracellular cations is not voltage dependent, and both onset and recovery from block occur within seconds. Single-channel experiments using the inside-out patch configuration show that internally applied Cd2+ and Zn2+ are not effective blockers of IKATP. Experiments in the outside-out patch configuration confirm that the divalent cations interact directly with IKATP channel activity. Our study also shows that this block of IKATP is dependent on intracellular ATP concentrations. Under whole-cell conditions, when cells are dialyzed with [ATP]pipette = 0, the degree of cation block is reduced. This dependence on intracellular ATP was confirmed at the single-channel level by experiments in excised, inside-out patch configurations. Our results show that some, but not all, divalent cations inhibit current through IKATP channels by binding to sites that are not within the transmembrane electric field, but are on the extracellular membrane surface. The interdependence of internal ATP and external divalent cation binding is consistent with an allosteric interaction between two binding sites and is highly suggestive of a modulatory mechanism involving conformational change of the channel protein.
