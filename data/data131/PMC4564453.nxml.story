There were 44 infants and children with the age at diagnosis ranging from 11 weeks to 16 years; 32 were predominantly in the CPA and/or CMF whereas 12 showed an extension to the fourth ventricle. Pathology showed 14 ependymomas, 12 benign gliomas (11 pilocytic astrocytomas, 1 ganglioglioma), 4 atypical teratoid rhabdoid tumors (ATRTs), 4 epidermoids, 3 primitive neuroectodermal tumors (PNETs), 3 meningiomas, 3 nerve sheath tumors, and 1 glioblastoma. The anatomical site of tumor origin was the lateral recess of the fourth ventricle in 13 patients, the ventral cerebellar hemisphere in 8, the cerebellar peduncle in 7, and the brain stem in 6. Others were from embryonal nest, cranial nerve, or meninges. For 42 tumor resections, 38 were approached through a posterior fossa craniotomy and 4 through a temporal craniotomy and transtentorial approach. At tumor resection, 26 had a gross total or near total resection, 12 subtotal resection, and 4 partial resection. There were no mortalities. The most significant morbidity was ninth and tenth nerve palsy; 15 patients had unilateral vocal cord palsy or dysphagia. Of these, nine were treated with nasogastric (NG) feeding tube, five with a combination of gastrostomy (G-tube) and tracheotomy, and one with G-tube. All had successful removal of NG feeding from 1 month to 2 years (average 6 months). The tracheostomy and G-tube were removed between 4 months and 2 years (average 14 months) in all.
