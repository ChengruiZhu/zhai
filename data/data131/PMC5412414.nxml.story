The term spondyloarthritis (SpA) is used to describe a group of multifactorial chronic inflammatory diseases characterized by a predisposing genetic background and clinical manifestations typically involving the sacroiliac joint. The absence of pathognomonic clinical and/or laboratory findings generally results in a delay in diagnosis and, consequently, in treatment. In addition, 20–40% of SpA patients are non-responders to tumor necrosis factor (TNF) inhibitor therapies. Given these considerations, it is important to identify biomarkers that can facilitate the diagnosis and assessment of disease activity. As inflammation plays a key role in the pathogenesis of SpA, inflammatory mediators have been investigated as potential biomarkers for diagnosing the disease and predicting response to therapy. Some investigators have focused their attention on the role of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), which are known to be markers of synovial inflammation that is generated in the joint in reaction to inflammatory stimuli. Several studies have been carried out to verify if serum MMPs levels could be useful to diagnose SpA, to assess disease severity, and to predict response to TNF inhibitor therapy. The current review focuses on MMPs’ role in SpA pathogenesis, diagnosis and therapeutic implications.
