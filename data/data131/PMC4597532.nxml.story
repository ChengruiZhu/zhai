In total, 1440 primary ACLRâ€™s were performed between 2002 and 2004 as part of the study cohort. Of these, 286 subjects underwent concurrent meniscus repair (298 meniscal repairs). 235/286 (82.2%) were available for follow up at 6 years (154 medial meniscus repairs, 72 lateral meniscal repairs, and 9 patients who underwent both lateral and medial meniscal repairs). Overall, the success rate of meniscal repair at the time of ACLR was 86% (202/235) at 6 years. We found an 86.4% six year success rate with combined ACLR and medial meniscal repair, 86.1% for lateral meniscal repairs and 77.8% when both medial and lateral menisci were repaired. 27.3% (9/33) of the failures were associated revision ACL surgery. Medial meniscal repairs failed earlier (mean 2.1 years) than lateral meniscal repairs (mean 3.7 years) (p=0.01). All-inside techniques were performed in 88.5% of cases. There were 31 failures with this technique representing a 14.9% failure rate. There was one failure in the inside-out technique group (1/19, 5.2%), and one failure noted in the outside-in technique group (1/6, 16.6%). Significant improvements were observed in patient reported outcomes [KOOS Symptoms, KOOS Pain, KOOS KRQOL, WOMAC Pain, and IKDC scores] when baseline scores were compared to 6-year follow-up. No significant clinical differences were observed between 2 and 6 year follow up indicating there was no clinical deterioration over this time period. Marx Activity levels gradually declined from time of injury to 6-year follow-up.
