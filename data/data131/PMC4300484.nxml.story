Familial Mediterranean Fever (FMF) is a hereditary autoinflammatory disease with autosomal recessive inheritance pattern often seen around the Mediterranean Sea. It is characterized by recurrent episodes of fever and polyserositis and rash. Recently, MEFV gene analysis determines the definitive diagnosis of FMF. In this study, we analyzed 12 MEFV gene mutations in more than 200 FMF patients, previously diagnosed by Tel-Hashomer clinical criteria, in northwest of Iran, located in the proximity of the Mediterranean Sea. In the northwest of Iran (Ardabil), 216 patients with FMF diagnosis, based on Tel-Hashomer criteria, referred to the genetic laboratory to be tested for the following mutations; P369S, F479L, M680I(G/C), M680I(G/A), I692del, M694V, M694I, K695R, V726A, A744S, R761H, E148Q. All patients were screened for MEFV gene mutations by a reverse hybridization assay (FMF Strip Assay, Vienna lab, Vienna, Austria) according to manufacturerâ€™s instructions. Among these FMF patients, no mutation was detected in 51 (23/62%) patients, but 165 (76/38%) patients had one or two mutations, 33 patients (15/28%) homozygous, 86 patients (39/81%) compound heterozygous and 46 patients (21/29%) were heterozygous. The most common mutations were M694V (23/61%), V726A (11/11%) and E148Q (9/95%) respectively.
