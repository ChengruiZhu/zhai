-glycosides of 5,6-dichlorobenzimidazole were considerably less active than DRB. In single cycle experiments, the degree of inhibition of Lee virus multiplication by DRB in membrane cultures was not dependent on the amount of virus in the inoculum. This compound did not inactivate the infectivity of extracellular Lee virus, had no effect on virus-erythrocyte interaction, did not interfere with the adsorption of the virus by the host tissue, nor affect the release of newly formed virus from the membrane. The inhibitory effect of DRB on Lee virus multiplication, in contrast to that of 2,5-dimethylbenzimidazole, persisted after transfer of infected membranes into fresh culture medium not containing the compound. Both DRB and the 2,5-dimethyl compound caused 99 per cent inhibition of Lee virus multiplication without affecting oxygen uptake of the membrane. Tissue proliferation of membrane pieces in roller tube culture was not significantly affected by DRB at inhibitory concentration, whereas at equivalent concentration the 2,5-dimethyl compound did restrict cellular growth. At higher concentrations, both compounds caused retardation of cell proliferation. This effect was reversible on removal of either compound from the medium. The multiplication of several strains of influenza A and B viruses,
