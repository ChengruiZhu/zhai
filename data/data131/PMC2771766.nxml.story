Aging is characterized by a systemic decline of an organism's capacity in responding to internal and external stresses, leading to increased mortality. The mitochondrial Free Radical Theory of Aging (mFRTA) attributes this decline to the accumulation of damages, in the form of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) mutations, caused by free radical byproducts of metabolism. However, there is still a great deal of uncertainty with this theory due to the difficulties in quantifying mtDNA mutation burden. In this modeling study, we have shown that a random drift in mtDNA point mutation during life, in combination with the experimental sampling can explain the variability seen in some of the reported experimental data. Particularly, we found that while the average mutation increases in a linear fashion, the variability in the mutation load data increases over time, and thus a low number of data replicates can often lead to a deceptive inference of the mutation burden dynamics. The model also predicted a significant contribution from the embryonic developmental phase to the accumulation of mtDNA mutation burden. Furthermore, the model revealed that the replication rate of mtDNA is a major determinant of new mutations during development and in fast-dividing tissues.
