Angiogenesis, the growth of new blood vessels from the existing vasculature, is critical for maintenance of health and response to injury. In ischemic disease, this process is impaired, but therapies targeting a key family of proteins, the vascular endothelial growth factors (VEGF), have failed to translate clinically. This suggests a need for deeper understanding of the complex regulation underlying angiogenic signaling. Here, we translate a previously developed and validated model of VEGF family signaling into a human, whole-body framework. The different splice isoforms of VEGF and the related PlGF proteins have different affinities for the extracellular matrix (ECM) and the co-receptor Neuropilin-1. Using our model, we examine the effect of these different binding properties on the distribution of each isoform in tissue, and subsequent receptor signaling. The model predicts isoform-specific receptor activation that is consistent with observed vascular phenotypes in mice expressing a single VEGF isoform; non-ECM-binding isoforms lead to signaling that promotes cell proliferation, while strong ECM-binding promotes migratory signaling and increased vessel branching. This understanding is critical for design of biomaterials that manipulate VEGF-ECM binding to control growth factor delivery, and for understanding of splicing-induced changes in VEGF family signaling in different tissues and in disease.
