 are frequently found amplified/overexpressed. The pharmacological targeting of these two P53-regulators in order to restore or increase P53 expression and activity represents therefore a strategy for cancer therapy. From the discovery of the Nutlins in 2004, several compounds have been developed and reported with the ability of targeting the P53-MDM2/X axis by inhibiting MDM2 and/or MDMX. From natural compounds up to small molecules and stapled peptides, these MDM2/X pharmacological inhibitors have been extensively studied, revealing different biological features and different rate of efficacy when tested in in vitro and in vivo experimental tumor models. The data/evidence coming from the preclinical experimentation have allowed the identification of the most promising molecules and the setting of clinical studies for their evaluation as monotherapy or in therapeutic combination with conventional chemotherapy or with innovative therapeutic protocols in different tumor settings. Preliminary results have been recently published reporting data about safety, tolerability, potential side effects, and efficacy of such therapeutic approaches. In this light, the aim of this review is to give an updated overview about the state of the art of the clinical evaluation of MDM2/X inhibitor compounds with a special attention to hematological malignancies and to the potential for the management of pediatric cancers.
