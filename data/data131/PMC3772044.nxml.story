Open chromatin formation and regulation are intimately coupled with nucleosome remodelling and modification. Regulatory regions such as promoters and enhancers maintain nucleosome-free, open chromatin states whilst at the same time the presence of nucleosomes is required for specific histone modifications. In this work, we carried out detailed analyses of our data of open chromatin maps for âˆ¼100 different yeast strains and whole-genome nucleosome occupancy along with the public data of open chromatin and nucleosome positioning in human generated in the ENCODE project. We observed nucleosomes positioned within accessible chromatin regions near their boundaries. These boundary nucleosomes appeared to carry various histone methylations without hampering the binding of DNA regulators and sequence preferences for these nucleosomes were associated with variation in the width of accessible chromatin. The end positions of open chromatin domains, particularly with high intrinsic preferences for nucleosome formation, were more flexible than the middle point, changing mostly within 150 bp upon genetic perturbation. By using quantitative trait loci (QTL) mapping, we identified genetic variants that are associated with the variation in the width of open chromatin and examined its relationship with nearby gene expression.
