Primary dural lymphoma (PDL) refers to a lymphoma with epidural or subdural involvement and is a rare subtype of primary central nervous system lymphoma. Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) presenting as PDL is extremely rare. The present study reports a case of PDL with skull and scalp involvement in a 56-year-old man. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed that the tumor was located under the right parietal inner plate and was attached to the dura mater. Following contrast-enhanced MRI, markedly enhanced tumor signals were observed, and mild homogeneous enhancement was observed in the diploÃ« and soft tissues under the scalp, near the parietal bone. Under general anesthesia, the patient underwent craniotomy and tumor resection. The postoperative pathological diagnosis was DLBCL. Tumors were additionally identified inside the skull and subcutaneous tissues. The patient was administered chemotherapy postoperatively, and the prognosis subsequent to the 4-year follow-up was favorable. Primary malignant lymphoma should be considered in the differential diagnosis of scalp masses and meningeal lesions. Early diagnosis and individualized treatment is closely associated with a favorable outcome.
