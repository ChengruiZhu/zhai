This study investigated the TNF-α-induced ICAM-1 and VCAM-1 expression on mouse lingual lymphatic vessels. All podoplanin-positive lymphatic vessels expressed PECAM-1. In the lamina propria mucosae of TNF-α-treated tongue, almost all initial lymphatics expressed ICAM-1. There were initial lymphatics with the VCAM-1 expression and also the vessels without the expression. In the tunica muscularis of TNF-α-treated tongue, collecting lymphatic vessels expressed ICAM-1, but rarely expressed VCAM-1 whereas blood vessels simultaneously expressed ICAM-1 and VCAM-1. The ICAM-1-positive rate increased with TNF-α to 75% from 10% on initial lymphatics, and to 40% from 0% on collecting lymphatic vessels while it increased to 90% from 45% on blood vessels. The VCAM-1-positive rate increased with TNF-α to 30% from 0% on initial lymphatics, and to 5% from 0% on collecting lymphatic vessels while it increased to 75% from 5% on blood vessels. These findings suggest that the lingual lymphatic endothelium has the ability to express ICAM-1, and VCAM-1 to a lesser extent than the ICAM-1 induction with TNF-α, and that the ICAM-1 and VCAM-1 induction predominantly occurs in the initial lymphatics compared with collecting lymphatic vessels.
