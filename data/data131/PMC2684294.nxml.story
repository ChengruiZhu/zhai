We report an unusual case of a localized Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-positive B cell lymphoproliferative disorder (LPD)/polymorphous B cell lymphoma of the urinary bladder in a 67 years old female patient. She had no known predisposing immunodeficiencies and presented with recent onset of hematuria. The CT and cystoscopic examination revealed a localized 2.5 cm polypoid or plaque-like mucosal mass on the right posterior and lateral wall of the bladder. The biopsy sample showed a diffuse and densely polymorphous atypical lymphoid infiltrate admixed with numerous small lymphocytes, histiocytes and occasional plasma cells and neutrophils. The large atypical cells were CD20+, CD79a+, CD30+, CD43+ and they were strongly positive for EBV by in situ hybridization using anti-EBER-1 probe. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for immunoglobulin heavy chain gene rearrangement study showed a clonal gene rearrangement. The findings indicated EBV+LPD of the bladder. Primary lymphoma of bladder is rare and primary EBV+LPD of the bladder has not been previously described. Potential misdiagnosis of poorly differentiated urothelial carcinoma can occur and accurate diagnosis depends on comprehensive immunohistochemical and molecular workups.
