PRP soaked implants (contact model) integrated with host tissue in 73% of samples, whereas control implants integrated in 19% of samples (p<0.05). The integration strength was significantly increased in the PRP soaked implant group compared to controls (219 ± 35.4 kPa and 72.0 ± 28.5 kPa, respectively, p<0.05). This correlated with an increase in glycosaminoglycan and collagen accumulation in the region of integration in the PRP treated implant group (p<0.05). Immunohistochemical studies revealed that the integration zone was rich in collagen type II and aggrecan. The cells at the zone of integration in the PRP soaked group had a 3.5 fold increase in matrix metalloproteinase 13 (MMP13) gene expression (p<0.05) compared to controls. In the non-contact cultures, a network of fibers developed to connect the PRP soaked construct to the native plug. No fibers formed when the constructs were not soaked in PRP. Time-lapse videos showed chondrocytes with a round phenotype migrating along the fibers and undergoing cell division within 24 hours. These cells came from the bioengineered cartilage whereas migrating cells from native cartilage were only seen after 5 days in select cultures. After 2 weeks, the cells deposited cartilage-like matrix around the fibers as seen histologically. A single layer of cells expressed MMP13 on the outer aspects of the tissue.
