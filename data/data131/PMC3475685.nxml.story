Local field potentials (LFPs) are low-frequency fluctuations of the electric fields produced by the brain. They have been widely studied to understand brain function and activity. LFPs reflect the activity of neurons within a few square millimeters of the cerebral cortex, an area containing more than 10,000 neurons. To avoid the complexity of simulating such a large number of individual neurons, the continuum cortex model was devised to simulate the collective activity of groups of neurons generating cortical LFPs. However, the continuum cortex model assumes that the cortex is two-dimensional and does not take into account the laminar architecture of the cerebral cortex. We developed a three-dimensional laminar cortex model (LCM) by combining laminar architecture with the continuum cortex model. This expansion enables the LCM to simulate the detailed three-dimensional distribution of the LFP within the cortex. We used the LCM to simulate LFPs within the visual cortex under different conditions of visual stimulation. The LCM reproduced the key features of LFPs observed in electrophysiological experiments. We conclude that the LCM is a potentially useful tool to investigate the underlying mechanism of LFPs.
