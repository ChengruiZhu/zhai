We discover that genetic variants associated with specific diseases have more in common with each other than we have previously seen. Specifically, variants associated with the same disease tend to be in parts of the genome that are turned on or off in similar complex patterns across many different cell types. We discover that genetic variants associated with specific diseases are found within regulatory elements that share patterns of expression. Specifically, variants associated with the same disease tend to be in parts of the genome that are turned on or off together in similar complex patterns across many different cell types. Knowing this helps us to find new variants associated with some diseases, and to better understand the genetic causes of other diseases. Furthermore, we discover that the genetic causes of inflammatory bowel disease fall into two distinct patterns, indicating that two aetiologically-distinct endotypes of this condition exist. Unlike other methods to learn about disease mechanisms from genetic information, our approach does not require any knowledge or assumptions about the genes themselvesâ€“it depends only on the patterns in which parts of the genome are activated in different cell types.
