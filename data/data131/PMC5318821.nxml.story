Juvenile Tillaux Fracture is an isolated fracture of the lateral portion of the distal tibial epiphysis, considered SALTER-HARRIS fracture type 3, wherein the fragment is moved by the anterolateral ligament anterior inferior tibiofibular. They occur at the beginning of the 2nd decade of life and are caused by a force external rotation. The pattern of injury is considered a result of the closing sequence of the distal tibial physis, which usually closes around 15 years of age in girls and 17 in boys, this process usually takes about 18 months, occurring first in the central area of the physis, extending medially and finally to side, being this epiphyseal portion which is open at the time of the vulnerable to fracture injury in this age group. The curriculum includes RX, and TAC, being more sensitive to detect fragments of 2 or more mm of travel, but may overestimate the true displacement. The non-displaced fracture can be treated with cast immobilization and displaced with closed reduction (plantar flexion external rotation in the pronated foot and direct pressure on the anterolateral epiphysis). An equal displacement or > 2 mm of the articular surface is indication of open reduction and percutaneous fixation, because it may increase the risk of osteoarthritis in the future.
