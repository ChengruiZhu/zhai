Considerable evidence supports the idea that stem-like cells may play an essential role during the development of colorectal cancer (CRC). To accomplish this aim, we use immunohistochemistry (IHC) and double IHC with different potential stem-like markers, anti-musashi (Msi), anti-CD133, anti- LGR5 and anti-ALDH1 to examine the presentation of stem-like cells in different compartments including adenoma/CRC epithelium, transitional crypts and tumor stroma in colorectal adenoma and CRC. The results showed that cells positive for stem-like markers were remarkably increased in number and frequently observed in the adenoma/CRC epithelium, transitional crypts and tumor stroma. Notably, the population of cells positive for stem-liker markers was expanded from the base to the middle part of the transitional crypt in both adenoma and CRC tissues, reflecting that stem-like cells are likely involved in the process of colorectal tumorigenesis. Counting results showed that the grading scores of cells positive for LGR5 and ALDH1 in the adenoma/CRC epithelium were significantly increased relative with the control epithelium, and associated with the degree of dysplasia in the adenoma and node involvement in the CRC (all
