Sixty premolars extracted for orthodontic reason were obtained and the buccal surfaces of teeth were reduced to create a flat dentine surface. The samples were randomly divided into three sub-groups for AdheSE (ASE) (Ivoclar – Vivadent, Schaan, Liechtenstein) and three sub-groups for Adper Prompt Self-Etch Adhesive (ADP) (3M ESPE, St Paul, MN, USA) of 10 each. For AdheSE (ASE); ASE-I was the control group (primer applied to fresh dentine surface), ASE-II was the contamination group (primer applied, followed by saliva contamination and then air dried) and ASE-III was the decontamination group (primer applied, followed by saliva contamination, air dried and then primer reapplied). For Adper Prompt (ADP); ADP-I was the control group (self-etch adhesive applied to fresh dentine surface), ADP-II was the contamination group (self-etch adhesive applied, followed by saliva contamination and then air dried) and ADP-III was the decontamination group (self-etch adhesive applied, followed by saliva contamination, air dried and then self-etch adhesive reapplied). Followed by the bonding procedure, a 5 mm composite resin block with Filtek P-60 (3M ESPE, St Paul, MN, USA) was built on the substrate. Shear bond strength (SBS) was tested with Instron Universal testing machine (Instron Corporation, Canton, MA, USA) with a cross head speed of 1 mm per minute. Data obtained was subjected to one way ANOVA test, while the inter group comparison was made using Tukey’s multiple comparison and Unpaired
