Little is known about how data from wearable sensors can be used apart from fitness tracking. We comprehensively studied 233 normal volunteers, integrating data from wearable sensors with lifestyle questionnaires, cardiac imaging, sphingolipid profiling, and clinical measurements of various heart and metabolic disease markers. Apart from showing that wearable sensors can be used to identify groups of volunteers with distinct behavioral and demographic characteristics, we showed that resting heart rate (RHR) from wearables performed better than step counts in predicting heart and metabolic disease risk markers. Notably, we further demonstrated that wearable data could be used in 2 areas of biomedical research. In the field of cardiac imaging, we showed that activity data from wearables can be used to determine how the size of heart is influenced by physical activity. Wearable data could also identify active individuals that are more likely than others to have enlarged hearts and potentially be misdiagnosed with heart disease. In the field of lipidomics, we showed that wearable data can be used to identify species of sphingolipids that are affected by how active a person is. Some of these compounds are known to be associated with obesity, diabetes, and heart disease.
