The circadian clock is a physiological timing mechanism that allows organisms to anticipate and adapt to the day-night cycle. Since it ticks with a period that is not precisely 24 h, it is vital that it is reset on a daily basis by signals such as light to ensure that it remains synchronized with the day-night cycle. The molecular mechanisms whereby light regulates the clock remain incompletely understood. Here we have studied a cavefish that has evolved for millions of years in the perpetual darkness of subterranean caves in Somalia. Like many other cave animals, these fish display striking adaptations to their extreme environment, including complete eye degeneration. We show that despite evolving in a constant environment, this blind cavefish still retains a circadian clock. However, this clock ticks with an extremely long period (nearly 47 h), and importantly it does not respond to light. We reveal that eye loss does not account for this “blind” clock. Specifically, mutations of two widely expressed non-visual opsin photoreceptors (Melanopsin and TMT opsin) are responsible for the blind clock phenotype in the cavefish. Our work illustrates the great utility of cavefish for studying the evolution and regulation of the circadian clock.
