We report the case of a 77-year-old Caucasian male patient who presented initially with a clinical picture of acute cholangitis approximately 2 years after a left lower lobectomy for a low-grade squamous lung carcinoma. CT scan imaging of the abdomen and chest revealed an abnormal growth of the pancreatic head and distention of both the intra- and extra-hepatic billiary tree, whereas osteolytic abnormalities were observed of the 5th left rib, consistent with secondary deposits. Initially an endoscopic retrograde cholangio-pancreatography (ERCP) and sphincterectomy was performed and a plastic stent was placed in the common bile duct to decompress the biliary tree. Cytological examination of the aspirate collected by FNA of the pancreatic lession under EUS guidance revealed cells consistent with a low grade squamous lung carcinoma. Two months later an open cholecystectomy along with a gastrojejunostomy was performed to relieve the patient's gastric outlet obstruction symptoms. Following remission of the patient's attack of acute cholangitis and excessive vomiting he was released from the hospital and instructed to initiate chemotherapy with vinorelbine. The patient succumbed to disseminated disease almost 5 months later.
