This study aimed to investigate the expression of metastasis suppressor 1 (MTSS1) in cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) and malignant cervical tissues, and the role of MTSS1 in carcinogenesis. MTSS1 expression was detected by immunohistochemistry in 147 cervical tissue specimens collected from 30 healthy individuals, 30 patients with cervical CIN I, 30 patients with CIN II–III and 57 patients with cervical cancer. The association between MTSS1 expression and clinicopathological factors was also examined. MTSS1 was found to be positively expressed in 43.33% CIN I cervical tissues, 100% CIN II–III cervical tissues and 100% malignant cervical tissues, but was weakly or negatively expressed in benign cervical tissues. The positive expression rates of MTSS1 were significantly higher in CIN II–III and malignant cervical tissues than in CIN I or normal cervical tissues (P<0.05). When examining MTSS1 expression and clinicopathological factors, the strong positive MTSS1 expression rates in early-stage versus middle- and advanced-stage cervical cancer tissues were 39.13% and 82.35%, respectively. Furthermore, the positive expression rates of MTSS1 were significantly higher in cervical tissues at an advanced clinical stage than those at an early clinical stage (P<0.05). The results suggest that the dysregulation of MTSS1 may be involved in cervical carcinogenesis, and thus MTSS1 may be a novel diagnostic biomarker or therapeutic target in cervical cancer patients.
