We reported that single oncosuppressor-mutated (SOM) cells turn malignant when exposed to cancer patientsâ€™ sera. We tested the possibility to incorporate this discovery into a biological platform able to detect cancer in healthy individuals and to predict metastases after tumor resection. Blood was drawn prior to tumor resection and within a year after surgery. Blood samples from healthy individuals or metastatic patients were used as negative and positive controls, respectively. Patients at risk for cancer were included in the screening cohort. Once treated, cells were injected into nonobese diabetic/severe combined immunodeficiency mice to monitor tumor growth. All samples of sera coming from metastatic patients transformed SOM cells into malignant cells. Four samples from screened patients transformed SOM cells. Further clinical tests done on these patients showed the presence of early cancerous lesions despite normal tumor markers. Based on the xenotransplants size, we were able to predict metastasis in three patients before diagnostic tests confirmed the presence of the metastatic lesions. These data show that this serum-based platform has potentials to be used for cancer screening and for identification of patients at risks to develop metastases regardless of the Tumor Node Metastasis (TNM) stage or tumor markers level.
