Cerebral autoregulation is an important mechanism that regulates blood supply to brain tissue to match metabolic demands during daily activities. Impaired cerebral autoregulation increases the dependence of cerebral blood flow on systemic blood pressure, and is associated with fatal outcomes in patients after brain injury and acute ischemic stroke. Reliable and noninvasive assessment of cerebral autoregulation is still a major challenge in medical diagnostics and clinic studies, mainly because blood pressure and flow are intrinsically nonstationary (possessing complex oscillations/fluctuations with varying amplitude and frequency) while traditional methods for assessment of the pressure-flow dependence assume stationary signals. We propose a new computational technique that is based on nonlinear theories without the assumption of stationary signals. This technique allows us to detect the degradation of cerebral autoregulation in patients with mild ischemic stroke even at >6 months after the insult. The degradation was present in both stroke and non-stroke sides and was accompanied by an altered pressure-flow interaction over a wide range of frequencies from 0.02–0.38 Hz. Our results challenges the traditionally accepted functional region of autoregulation (<∼0.1 Hz). The observed long-term influences of stroke highlight the importance of reliable monitoring of cerebral blood flow regulation for the management and daily care of stroke patients.
