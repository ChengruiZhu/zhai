Previous studies have investigated the relationships between PSCA rs2294008 C>T and rs2976392 G>A polymorphisms and cancer susceptibility. However, the available findings remained inconsistent and even controversial. Thus, the aim of this meta-analysis was performed to clarify such associations. The online databases PubMed, EMBASE and Web of Science searched for relevant studies, covering all the papers published until September 1st, 2016. Data were pooled by odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) to evaluate the strength of such associations. Then, trial sequential analysis was performed to estimate whether the evidence of the results was firm. Overall, a significant increased risk of cancer was associated with PSCA rs2294008 C>T and rs2976392 G>A polymorphisms. For the PSCA rs2294008 polymorphism, when stratified by type of cancer, the results were significant especially in gastric cancer and bladder cancer. Moreover, in the subgroup analysis by ethnicity, significant results were detected in both Asian and Caucasian populations. Similarly, for the PSCA rs2976392 polymorphism, the stratification analyses by type of cancer showed that the results were significant only in gastric cancer. In addition, the stratification analyses by ethnicity detected that this polymorphism increased cancer risk only in Asian populations. Then, trial sequential analyses demonstrated that the results of the meta-analysis were based on sufficient evidence. Therefore, this meta-analysis suggested that the PSCA rs2294008 C>T and rs2976392 G>A polymorphisms might be associated with cancer susceptibility, which might act as a potential predicted biomarker for genetic susceptibility to cancer, especially in gastric cancer and bladd er cancer.
