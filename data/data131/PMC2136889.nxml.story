, 1, 2, or 3 days prior to cell transfer. 3. Agglutinins failed to appear in cell-transfer experiments after the pre-injection not only of blood leucocytes, but also of lymph node cells, peritoneal exudate cells, or thymus cells of rabbits. This effect was not brought about by pre-injection of erythrocytes of rabbits or leucocytes of chicken, cow, or horse. The pre-injection of leucocytes of human blood had an effect of partial suppression. 4. When the leucocytes for pre-injection were pooled from groups of rabbits, either the prospective donors of the lymph node cells or other rabbits, essentially complete suppression of agglutinin titers occurred regularly. When the leucocytes for pre-injection were obtained from an individual rabbit and the lymph node cells from another rabbit the suppression of the recipients' titers occurred sporadically. 5. When the recipient's own leucocytes were pre-injected the subsequent agglutinin titers were somewhat lower than those of the non-pre-injected controls. When the recipient's whole blood was re-injected as the source of leucocytes the subsequent agglutinin titers were as high as those of the non-pre-injected controls. 6. The pre-injection effect was not obtained if the leucocytes had been heated, frozen and thawed, suspended in distilled water, lyophilized, or treated with sodium iodoacetate. However, sonic oscillation or x-irradiation of the leucocytes had no effect on their capacity to bring about the pre-injection effect.
