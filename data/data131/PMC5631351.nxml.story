Of 185 diagnosed with LD, 19% (35/185) had neuroborreliosis, including 29 early LD (ELD) and 6 late LD (LLD). The mean age was 44 yrs (±20) in ELD and 61(±11) in LLD. The median symptom duration was 14d (1–69) in ELD and 182d (140–2570) in LLD. Facial nerve palsy was most common, 54% (19/29 in ELD vs. 0/6 in LLD), followed by meningitis 20% (4/29 vs. 3/6), radiculopathy 20% (6/29 vs. 1/6), encephalopathy 3% (0/29 vs. 1/6), and peripheral neuropathy 3% (0/29 vs. 1/6) (P = 0.001). No encephalitis was identified. The median treatment duration (days) was 30 (10–135) in ELD and 56 (28–230) in LLD. All 35 patients were treated with doxycycline and/or ceftriaxone (16, 46% IV). Of the 32 followed patients, 28/32 (88%) responded to antibiotics, whereas 4/32 (12%) remained symptomatic with median follow-up duration of 72 days. Four non-responsive cases included 1 ELD (radiculopathy) and 3 LLDs (meningitis, encephalopathy, and peripheral neuropathy). The rate of non-response to antibiotics was higher in late LD (4% of ELD vs. 60% of LLD; P = 0.008). There was no statistically significant difference between outcome groups when comparing age, treatment duration, history of anxiety/depression, and route of treatment (p > 0.05, respectively).
