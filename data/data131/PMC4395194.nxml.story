Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) accounts for most lung cancer. To develop new therapy required the elucidation of NSCLC pathogenesis. The deubiquitinating enzymes USP 28 has been identified and studied in colon and breast carcinomas. However, the role of USP28 in NSCLC is unknown. The level mRNA or protein level of USP28 were measured by qRT-PCR or immunohistochemistry (IHC). The role of USP28 in patient survival was revealed by Kaplanâ€“Meier plot of overall survival in NSCLC patients. USP28 was up or down regulated by overexpression plasmid or siRNA transfection. Cell proliferation and apoptosis was assayed by MTT and FACS separately. Potential microRNAs, which targeted USP28, were predicated by bioinformatic algorithm and confirmed by Dual Luciferase reporter assay system. High mRNA and protein level of USP28 in NSCLC were both correlated with low patient survival rate. Overexpression of USP28 promoted NSCLC cells growth and vice versa. Down-regulation of USP28 induced cell apoptosis. USP28 was targeted by miR-4295. Overexpression of USP28 promoted NSCLC cells proliferation, and was associated with poor prognosis in NSCLC patients. The expression of USP28 may be regulated by miR-4295. Our data suggested that USP28 was a tumour-promoting factor and a promising therapeutic target for NSCLC.
