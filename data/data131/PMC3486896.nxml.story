Chromosome breakage can occur during normal cell division. When it occurs, the breaks do not arise randomly throughout the genome, but at preferred locations referred to as fragile sites. Chromosome breakage at fragile sites is an evolutionarily conserved phenomenon, implicated in evolution and speciation. In humans, fragile site instability is also implicated in mental retardation and cancer. Despite its biological and clinical relevance, the mechanism(s) by which breaks are introduced at mammalian fragile sites remains unresolved. Although several plausible models have been proposed, it has not been possible to ascertain their contribution, largely due to the lack of a suitable experimental system. Here, we study a yeast model system that closely recapitulates the phenomenon of chromosome breakage at mammalian fragile sites. We eliminate all but one of the currently considered modelsâ€”premature compaction of the incompletely replicated genome in preparation for their segregation during cell division. We also find that the breakage required functions of three proteins involved in the genome compaction, an essential process that is evolutionarily conserved from bacteria to humans. Our findings suggest that a fundamental chromosomal process required for normal cell division can paradoxically cause genome instability and/or cell death, by triggering chromosome breakage at fragile sites.
