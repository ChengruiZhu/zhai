Immunologic surveillance is a function of the immune system which serves to constantly monitor the body for microorganisms, foreign tissue, and cancer cells. To evade this surveillance and subsequent elimination, cancer cells evolve strategies to prevent being recognized and killed by immune system cells; one mechanism is to increase the rate at which genetic and/or epigenetic variability is generated. The benefits of an increased variability of cancer cells to counteract immune surveillance, however, stands in contrast to the costs associated with such heightened mutation rates: the risk of an inability to maintain essential genome structure and functions. To study such situations arising in tumorigenesis, we designed a novel mathematical framework of tumor immunosurveillance and the evolution of mutation rates. We then utilized this framework to study how increased mutation rates and immunologic surveillance affect the abundance of tumor and immune system cells. We found that there exists an optimum number of tumor variants and an optimum magnitude of mutation rates that maximize tumor progression despite the presence of actively proliferating and functioning immune system cells. Our study contributes to an understanding of cancer development during immune system attacks and also suggests treatment strategies for heterogeneous tumor cell populations.
