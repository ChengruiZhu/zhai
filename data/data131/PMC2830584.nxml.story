Congenital heart defects (CHD) are the most common developmental errors in humans, affecting 8 out of 1,000 newborns. Clinical diagnosis and treatment of CHD has dramatically improved in the last decades. Hence, the majority of CHD patients are now reaching reproductive age. While the risk of familial recurrence has been evaluated in various population studies, little is known about the genetic pathogenesis of CHD. In recent years significant progress has been made in uncovering genetic processes during cardiac development. Data from human genetic studies in CHD patients indicate that the genetic aetiology was presumably underestimated in the past. Inherited mutations in genes encoding cardiac transcription factors and sarcomeric proteins were found as an underlying cause for familial recurrence of non-syndromic CHD in humans, in particular cardiac septal defects. Notably, the cardiac phenotypes most frequently seen in mutation carriers are ostium secundum atrial septal defects (ASDII). This review outlines experimental approaches employed for the detection of CHD-related genes in humans and summarizes recent findings in molecular genetics of congenital cardiac septal defects with an emphasis on ASDII.
