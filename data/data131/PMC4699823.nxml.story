These findings indicate that adolescents discharged from the hospital after an admission for violence-related, drug- or alcohol-related, or self-inflicted injuries have increased risks of subsequent harm up to a decade later. Misclassification of some adversity-related injuries as accident-related injuries may affect the accuracy of these findings. Another important limitation of this observational study is residual confounding. That is, although the researchers adjusted for known factors likely to affect the risk of re-admission or death in their analysis, the adolescents who were re-admitted or died subsequent to discharge after an adversity-related injury may have shared other unknown characteristics that were responsible for their increased risk of harm. Nevertheless, these findings identify several risk factors that clinicians and service providers can use to identify those adolescents admitted to hospital with an injury who are at high or low risk of subsequent harm. Specifically, these findings suggest that the introduction of strategies for reducing subsequent harm after discharge should be considered for all types of adversity-related injury, particularly when it occurs in older adolescents.
