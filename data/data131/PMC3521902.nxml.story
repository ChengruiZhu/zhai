The hip joint is one of the major structures in the human body and the resultant force acting through the hip joint is 300% of body weight. Therefore, weight bearing, as a cause of ischaemia, may contribute to the development of non-traumatic osteonecrosis of the femoral head (ONFH). However, it remains unclear whether weight bearing is related to the development of non-traumatic ONFH. Therefore the aim of this study was to clarify the role of weight bearing in the development of non-traumatic ONFH. Non-weight-bearing (NWB) rats were tail suspended to prevent any weight coming to bear on the hindlimbs from day 1 to the time of sacrifice. The weight-bearing (WB) group rats were also housed individually, although without tail suspension. All rats were injected with lipopolysaccharide and methylprednisolone to promote the development of non-traumatic ONFH. All animals were sacrificed three weeks after the final methylprednisolone injection. Histopathological analysis was performed. Osteonecrosis of the femoral head was observed not only in the NWB but also in the WB rats; however, no osteonecrosis of the humeral head was observed in either group. We confirmed that non-traumatic ONFH developed in NWB rats, suggesting that weight bearing does not contribute to the development of non-traumatic ONFH in rats.
