The detection of severe malaria in resource–constrained settings is often difficult because of requirements for laboratory infrastructure and/or clinical expertise. The aim of this study, therefore, was to explore the utility of a multiple antigen (HRP–2/pLDH) rapid diagnostic test (RDT) as a low–cost, surrogate marker of patients at high risk for complications of severe malaria. We reviewed programmatic data at a peripheral health center in Western Uganda. Available demographic and clinical data on all individuals presenting to the center who underwent an RDT for suspected malaria infection were reviewed. We fit logistic regression models to identify correlates of two outcomes of interest: 1) severe malaria–related anemia, defined here as hemoglobin ≤7g/dL and 2) receipt of parenteral quinine. 1509 patients underwent malaria testing with an SD FK60 RDT during the observation period. A total of 637 (42%) RDTs were positive for at least one species of malaria, of which 326 (51%) exhibited a single HRP–2 band and 307 (48%) exhibited both HRP–2 and pLDH bands, while 4 exhibited only a single pLDH band. There was a trend towards more severe anemia in patients with a HRP–2/pLDH positive RDT compared to a HRP–2 only RDT (β = –0.99 g/dl, 95% CI –1.99 to 0.02,
