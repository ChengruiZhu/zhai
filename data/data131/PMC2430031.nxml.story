We survey blood glucose control schemes for insulin-dependent diabetes therapies and systems. These schemes largely rely on mathematical models of the insulin-glucose relations, and these models are typically derived in an empirical or fundamental way. In an empirical way, the experimental insulin inputs and resulting blood-glucose outputs are used to generate a mathematical model, which includes a couple of equations approximating a very complex system. On the other hand, the insulin-glucose relation is also explained from the well-known facts of other biological mechanisms. Since these mechanisms are more or less related with each other, a mathematical model of the insulin-glucose system can be derived from these surrounding relations. This kind of method of the mathematical model derivation is called a fundamental method. Along with several mathematical models, researchers develop autonomous systems whether they involve medical devices or not to compensate metabolic disorders and these autonomous systems employ their own control methods. Basically, in insulin-dependent diabetes therapies, control methods are classified into three categories: open-loop, closed-loop, and partially closed-loop controls. The main difference among these methods is how much the systems are open to the outside people.
