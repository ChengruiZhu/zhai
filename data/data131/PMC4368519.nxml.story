In order to predict and mitigate the response of ecological communities to global change, we need to understand the processes that allow multiple species to coexist in close proximity. A classic idea in Ecology is that species coexist because they occupy different “niches”. However, random processes such as dispersal could also explain species coocurrence, without invoking niche differentiation. “Neutral” models embody this idea, omitting niche differentiation and assuming all species are identical. Such models are mostly statistically consistent with the relative abundances of tree species in tropical forests, but statistical procedures always contain an element of uncertainty and many other models could also be consistent with a particular data set. We compute how strong the non-neutral processes would need to be in order for their effect to be detectable in data sets of different sizes. We find that the largest ecological data sets currently available, such as the 50 hectare plot on Barro Colorado Island in Panama, are not large enough to distinguish between neutral and non-neutral models, unless multiple non-neutral processes are at work. This means that other types of pattern need to be studied, or larger data sets collected, in order to understand the mechanisms behind forest biodiversity.
