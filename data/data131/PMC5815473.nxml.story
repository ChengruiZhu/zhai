TPL inhibited cell proliferation of T-LBL cells (Jurkat cells and Molt-3 cells) in a dose-dependent manner. Flow cytometry analysis showed that cell apoptosis rate was increased by TPL treatment. TPL also up-regulated the expression of Caspase-3, Bax and down-regulated the expression of Bcl-2, indicating that TPL promoted apoptosis in Jurkat cells. Moreover, TPL inhibited invasion ability of Jurkat cells and down-regulated the expression of MMP-3 and MMP-9 in a dose-dependent manner. The expression of Snail, Slug, Twist and Integrin αVβ6 was decreased and the expression of E-cadherin was increased by TPL treatment, indicating that TPL inhibited EMT of Jurkat cells. Apart from that, TPL treatment attenuated the phoslevels of PI3K, Akt and mTOR and suppressed AKT activation compared with control group, suggesting that TPL inhibited PI3K/Akt/mTOR signal pathway in T-LBL. In vivo experiments showed that TPL inhibited tumor growth of T-LBL and promoted apoptosis of tumor cells. The expression of PCNA, Bcl-2, Snail, p-PI3K, p-Akt and mTOR was suppressed by TPL in a dose-dependent manner, suggesting that TPL suppressed tumor growth and promoted apoptosis of tumor cells by inhibiting PI3K/Akt/mTOR signal pathway in T-LBL.
