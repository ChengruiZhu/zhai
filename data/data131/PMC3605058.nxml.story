Brain activity shows complex dynamics, even in the absence of external stimulation. In fact, most brain activity is generated internally. Therefore, it is crucial to understand the generation principles of internal activity. One hypothesis is that complex brain dynamics emerges from simple local interactions if the network is in a specific state, called “self-organized critical” (SOC). SOC indeed can account for dynamics in slices of brain tissue. However, we lack evidence that human brain dynamics is SOC. In addition, we wondered whether SOC can account for brain activity from wakefulness to deep sleep, despite clear changes in brain dynamics with vigilances states. To answer these questions, we analyzed intracranial depth recordings in humans. We found evidence that the human brain indeed operates close to criticality from wakefulness to deep sleep. However, we found deviations from criticality with vigilance states. These deviations, together with our modelling results, indicated that the human brain is close to SOC, but in a subcritical regime. In the subcritical regime complex dynamics still emerges from purely local interactions, but are more stable than the SOC state. In fact, operation the subcritical regime allows for a safety margin to supercriticality, which was linked to epilepsy.
