We examined the changes in localization of alkaline phosphatase (ALP) and mannosidase II (man II), a Golgi marker, after colchicine treatment of primary cultures of fetal rat hepatocytes, using double immunofluorescence staining and confocal laser microscopy. In hepatocytes cultured in basal medium, ALP was localized in the perinuclear cytoplasm, and man II was observed in the Golgi region of the cytoplasm. When hepatocytes were cultured in dexamethasone-supplemented medium, ALP was also localized in the plasma membrane surrounding the bile canaliculus-like structure that was formed between adjacent cells. In hepatocytes cultured in the same medium containing colchicine, the structure of microtubules in the cytoplasm was lost, man II exhibited granular distribution scattering throughout the cytoplasm, and ALP was localized in coarse granular sites of the cytoplasm. However, ALP was not colocalized at the same sites as man II. The present study indicated that colchicine inhibits the dexamethasone-promoted translocation of ALP to the plasma membrane surrounding the bile canaliculus-like structure in primary cultures of fetal rat hepatocytes by disassembling microtubules and discomposing the Golgi complex.
