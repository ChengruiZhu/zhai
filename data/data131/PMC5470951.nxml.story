A shorter telomere length is associated with several systemic disorders. Telomere length may be an informative biomarker for the maintenance of the overall health status and mortality. There are a limited number of empirical studies concerning the effect of anthropometric parameters on telomere length. The data are derived from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey from 1999 to 2002. The primary outcomes of this study were to examine the potential relationships between the anthropometric indices and the telomere length, while secondary outcomes of this study was to investigate the association between different anthropometric indices and mortality risk. A significant positive correlation was noted between the mean telomere length and the thigh circumference (TC) and calf circumference (CC) in all designed models. Participants in the highest TC and CC quartiles tended to have a longer telomere length and lowered the hazards for all-cause mortality to 43% and 57%, respectively. Notably, the anthropometric indices involving the CC with higher values seemed to be surrogate markers for the reduction of the risk of all-cause, cardiovascular and malignancy-related mortality (all
