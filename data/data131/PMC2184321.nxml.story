The question of whether or not lymphoid cells can cooperate across a histocompatibility difference barrier has been studied in several laboratories. Using an adoptive transfer system, Katz et al. (1) first showed that T cells from (low responder Ã— high responder) F(1) mice, primed to the terpolymer L-glutamic acid, L-lysine, L-tyrosine (GLT), could collaborate with 2,4-dinitrophenyl (DNP)-primed B cells from a high responder, but not a low responder strain, in response to DNP-GLT. The response to GLT is under H- 2-1inked Ir gene control. In contrast, studies with mouse bone marrow chimeras have shown that T cells can interact with H-2-histoincompatible B cells in response to antigens not under Ir gene control (2-4). Another type of chimera, the allophenic mouse, has been used to study possible histoincompatible cell interactions to a number of antigens, including DNP-L- glutamic acid, L-lysine, L-alanine; L-glutamic acid, L-alanine, L-tyrosine; L-glutamic acid, L-lysine, L-phenylalanine; and poly-L (Tyr, Glu)-poly D,L- Ala-poly-L-Lys[T,G)-A-L] (5-9). The response to each of these antigens is under H-2-1inked Ir gene control. It was initially reported (8, 9) that in allophenic mice containing both high and low responder cells, the antibody to (T,G)-A-L was of both the high and low responder allotype. This was interpreted to mean that high responder T cells had cooperated with low responder B cells across a histocompatibility difference barrier in the environment of the allophenic mice. However, Press and McDevitt (10) have recently reported that additional and more accurate analyses of these allophenic mouse sera failed to detect any anti-(T,G)-A-L antibody of the low responder allotype. Moreover, in an experiment using bone marrow chimeras, there was no low responder allotype antibody produced in response to (T,G)-A- L(10). The present study was undertaken to test the immune response of allophonic mice to an antigen, DNP-bovine gamma globulin (DNP(56)BGG), known to be controlled by genes both inside and outside the H-2 complex (11, 12).(1) When high and low responder cells to DNP(56)BGG are present in allophenic mice, only antibody of the high responder allotype is produced. The results suggest that cell cooperation in allophenic mice cannot occur across a histocompatibility difference barrier in response to an antigen whose genetic control is at least partially within the H-2 complex.
