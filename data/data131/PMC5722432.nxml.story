Although the use of CT in medical diagnosis delivers radiation doses to patients that are higher than those from other radiological procedures, lack of optimized protocols could be an additional source of increased dose in developing countries. The aims of this study are, first, to determine the magnitude of radiation doses received by selected radiosensitive organs of patients undergoing CT examinations and compare them with other studies, and second, to assess how CT scanning protocols in practice affect patient organ doses. In order to achieve these objectives, patient organ doses from five common CT examinations were obtained from eight hospitals in Tanzania. The patient organ doses were estimated using measurements of CT dose indexes (CTDI), exposure‚Äêrelated parameters, and the ImPACT spreadsheet based on NRPB conversion factors. A large variation of mean organ doses among hospitals was observed for similar CT examinations. These variations largely originated from different CT scanning protocols used in different hospitals and scanner type. The mean organ doses in this study for the eye lens (for head), thyroid (for chest), breast (for chest), stomach (for abdomen), and ovary (for pelvis) were 63.9 mGy, 12.3 mGy, 26.1 mGy, 35.6 mGy, and 24.0 mGy, respectively. These values were mostly comparable to and slightly higher than the values of organ doses reported from the literature for the United Kingdom, Japan, Germany, Norway, and the Netherlands. It was concluded that patient organ doses could be substantially minimized through careful selection of scanning parameters based on clinical indications of study, patient size, and body region being examined. Additional dose reduction to superficial organs would require the use of shielding materials.
