A population pharmacokinetic (PPK) model of pomalidomide was developed and the influence of demographic and disease-related covariates on PPK parameters was assessed based on data from 6 clinical trials of pomalidomide (dose range, 0.5â€“10 mg) in healthy participants (n = 96) and patients with multiple myeloma (MM; n = 144). PPK data described herein suggest that systemic clearance of pomalidomide is comparable between healthy study participants and patients with MM. However, apparent peripheral volume of distribution and apparent intercompartmental clearance between central and peripheral compartments were 8- and 3.7-fold higher in patients with MM vs. healthy subjects, suggesting drug exposure is higher in peripheral compartments of patients with MM vs. healthy subjects. Covariate analysis suggested pomalidomide clearance is not affected by demographic factors except for gender, and it is unlikely this factor is clinically relevant. In addition, renal function as measured by creatinine clearance or renal impairment (RI) does not significantly affect clearance of pomalidomide. In conclusion, pomalidomide has robust pharmacokinetic exposure, not affected by demographic factors or renal impairment. Pomalidomide is preferentially taken up by tumors over healthy tissues in patients with MM.
