Genomic DNA can be modified by cytosine methylation. This epigenetic modification is layered on the primary genetic information and can silence the affected gene. Epigenetic modification has been implicated in cancer and aging. To date, the primary cause and the mechanism leading to DNA methylation are not known. By using a sophisticated genetic system, we have induced a single break in the double helix of the genomes of mouse or human cells. This rupture was repaired by a very precise mechanism: the damaged chromosome pairs and retrieves genetic information from an undamaged and homologous DNA partner. This homology-directed repair was marked in half of the repaired molecules by de novo methylation of cytosines flanking the cut. As a direct consequence, the gene in these repaired molecules was silenced. In the remaining molecules, the recombinant DNA was undermethylated and expressed the reconstituted gene. Since homology-directed repair may duplicate or delete genetic information, epigenetic modification of repaired DNA represents a powerful evolutionary force. If the expression of the repaired gene is harmful, only cells inheriting the silenced copy will survive. Conversely, if the function of the repaired gene is beneficial, cells inheriting the under-methylated copy will have a selective advantage.
