Tamaka Shvasa which has been mentioned in Ayurvedic classics shares multiple similarities with Bronchial Asthma. Symptom of breathlessness is the main complaint in Bronchial Asthma which can be assessed objectively by Pulmonary Function Test (PFT).The assessment of respiratory function is now a routine part of clinical practice. The expiratory flow rates- Forced Expiratory Volume in first second (FEV), Forced Vital Capacity (FVC) and Peak Expiratory Flow Rate (PEFR) are assessed by an Electronic Spirometer (Kent, England). Six weeks treatment with a compound preparation of herbs including - Sati (Hedichum spicatum, Rose), Puskaramoola (Innula racemosa, Linn), and Amalaki (Emblica officinalis, Gaertn) powder showed a significant effect of increase in Pulmonary Function values. The mean grade score plus standard deviation before trial of FEV, FVC, and PEFR were 62.6±15.06, 2.03±o.53 and 189±44.05 respectively. After six weeks of treatment with Puskaramooladi choorna FEV, FVC and PEFR showed highly significant results with values 63.45±15.9, 2.81±0.33 and 199.6±41.58 respectively. Puskaramooladi choorna can be used as one of the potent medicine in the treatment of the Bronchial Asthma.
