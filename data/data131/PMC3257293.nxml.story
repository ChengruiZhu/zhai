During mitosis the replicated chromosomes are distributed equally to the daughter cells. Once the chromosomes have segregated properly, a pathway called the mitotic exit network (MEN) becomes activated to complete mitosis. How MEN activation is coordinated with segregation of the chromosomes is currently a focus of interest. In budding yeast, Tem1 initiates MEN activation and Bfa1 negatively regulates Tem1 with Bub2. The polo kinase Cdc5 also activates MEN by directly phosphorylating and inhibiting Bfa1. The spindle pole body (SPB), which corresponds to the mammalian centrosome, acts as a platform for these MEN components. The Bfa1/Bub2 complex localizes to SPBs and regulates the association of Tem1 with the SPBs. When the spindle aligns correctly along the mother-bud axis, Bfa1/Bub2 is restricted to the bud-oriented SPB. Conversely, when the spindle is misaligned, Bfa1/Bub2 is present on both SPBs and mitotic exit is delayed, suggesting that the spatial distribution of Bfa1/Bub2 controls the timing of mitotic exit. In this study, we identified new Cdc5 target phosphorylation residues in Bfa1 that function in its asymmetric distribution on SPBs and showed that the asymmetric Bfa1 distribution was required for timely mitotic exit during unperturbed cell cycle of the budding yeast.
