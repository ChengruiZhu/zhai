For this purpose, eight-week experiments (drug therapy and exercise therapy) were carried out by using rats whose menopause was induced by the removal of an ovary. In the treatment of the drug therapy, the effects of soy protein, one of the well-known alendronate and estrogen replacement therapy, were compared and analyzed. In the treatment of the exercise therapy, endurance exercise using a treadmill and resistance exercise through climbing a special cage were compared and analyzed. Based on these results, this study will be able to suggest the most appropriate way to deal with osteoporosis which requires long-term treatment. Sixty eight-week-old Sprague-Dawley female rats had a week to adapt to the new environment. After that, they were randomly divided into four groups (Sham-Sedentary; SS, ovariectomized-control; OC, ovariectomized-soy protein; OS: ovariectomized-alendronate; OA, ovariectomized-endurance exercise; OE, ovariectomized-resistance exercise; OR) before having an operation for the removal of an ovary. After surgery, the rats convalesced for a week. Alendronate (0.4mg / kg of body weight) and isoflavones (200g / 1 kg of feed) were given to two groups respectively for eight weeks. The rats in the other two groups performed resistance exercise (climbing) and endurance exercise (20 m/min; 60min/day) five days a week for eight weeks.
