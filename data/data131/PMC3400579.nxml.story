While faced with a decision between two options for which you have no clear preference (say, a small cheap TV and a large expensive TV), you are presented with a new but inferior option (say, a medium expensive TV). The mere presence of the new option, which you would not select anyway, shifts your preference toward the expensive large TV. This simple example shows how the introduction of an irrelevant option, called the “decoy,” to the choice set can change preference between existing options, a phenomenon often called the context-dependent preference reversal. A number of models have been proposed to explain context effects. Despite their success, they are either uninformative about the underlying neural mechanisms or they require comparison of every possible pair of option attributes, a computation that is unlikely to be implemented by the nervous system due to its high computational demand and undesirable outcomes when the choice set size increases. Here we present a novel account of the context-dependent preference based on the adjustment of neural response to the set of available options. Moreover, we show results from a novel behavioral task designed to test contrasting predictions of our model and a classic model of context effects.
