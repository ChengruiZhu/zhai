Laser light scattered by nonstimulated rat cardiac muscle bathed in physiological saline containing a [Ca++] of 0.4-2.5 mM displays scattered-light intensity fluctuations (SLIF); the frequencies of both SLIF and resting force are Ca++ dependent. Direct inspection of these muscles by phase-contrast microscopy under incoherent illumination revealed the presence of spontaneous asynchronous cellular motions that are also Ca++ dependent. The physical properties of the scattered light are compatible with the hypothesis that SLIF are due to the diastolic motion, except for the dependence on scattering angle, which may be perturbed because the muscles are optically thick. To determine whether diastolic SLIF and motion are an intrinsic property of activated myofilaments, photon-counting auto-correlation of the scattered light was performed both in rat right-ventricular papillary muscles skinned with the detergent Triton X-100 (1%) and in muscles with intact membranes under conditions that alter cellular Ca++ fluxes. In skinned muscles activated over a range of Ca++ from threshold to maximum force production, neither SLIF nor asynchronous motion was observed when Ca++ was buffered to constant values. In intact muscles the frequency of SLIF and the amplitude of diastolic motion were (a) markedly increased by substituting K+ or Li+ for Na+ in the bath; (b) not altered by verapamil (1 microM); and (c) reversibly abolished by caffeine (greater than or equal to 10 mM). These properties are exactly those of mechanical oscillations that have been observed in isolated cardiac cell fragments, which are the result Ca++ oscillations caused by Ca++ release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR). We infer that mechanical oscillations caused by spontaneous Ca++-induced Ca++ release from the SR occur in intact nonstimulated cardiac muscle even in the absence of Ca++ overload and are the principle cause of SLIF, and that myoplasmic [Ca++] in "resting" muscle is not in a microscopic steady state.
