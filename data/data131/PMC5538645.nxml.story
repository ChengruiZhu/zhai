Fat accumulation is a major health problem in many countries, but unlike white fat—which stores calories—brown fat is packed with mitochondria to burn energy. Therefore, promoting “browning” of white fat and enhancing brown fat activity are seen as promising therapeutic strategies to fight obesity. Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs), once largely believed to be functionally irrelevant, are receiving special attention because of the recent realization of their important role in many biological processes. Here, we performed a series of transcriptome analyses, including lncRNAs, during white fat browning and brown fat activation. Based on the mRNA–lncRNA coexpression network, we identified brown adipose tissue–enriched lncRNA 10 (lncBATE10) as a new regulator in brown adipocyte differentiation. Loss of lncBATE10 impaired expression of a brown fat–selective program in brown adipocytes and during browning of white adipocytes. We further showed that lncBATE10 could facilitate browning of white fat and brown fat activation by promoting Pgc1a expression. Taken together, we depicted a comprehensive noncoding transcriptome network during white fat browning and brown fat activation and identified lncBATE10 as a novel regulator in these processes.
