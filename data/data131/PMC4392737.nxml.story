The prevalence of blindness and poor vision were respectively 12.3% and 17.4% with regard to the worst eyes. Fifty nine (14.5%) patients were found with diabetic maculopathy, of whom 25.4% (15/59) had poor vision, and 25.4% (15/59) were blind. The prevalence of sight threatening retinopathy (severe non-proliferative and proliferative) was 17.4%. The degree of visual impairment was comparable in both diabetic types (p = 0.825), and it increased with the severity of retinopathy (p < 0.0001), as well as that of maculopathy (p <0.0001). The prevalence of glaucoma was 15% (61/407) when considering the worst eyes. The severity of visual impairment increased with the severity of glaucoma (p = 0.001). One hundred and twenty-one (29.7%) patients presented with cataract irrespective of its location or severity. Cataract was significantly associated with poor vision and blindness (p < 0.0001). Hypertensive retinopathy (4.9%), papillary ischaemia (2.7%), vaso-occlusive eye disease (2.5%), and age-related macular edema (2%) were the other potential causes of visual impairment and blindness encountered the most in our setting. Age ≥ 50 years, male sex, duration of diabetes and hypertension variously increased the risk of having glaucoma, cataract, diabetic retinopathy or maculopathy.
