Treatment of neurogenic bladder (BN) aims to upper urinary tract protection. When the conservative clinical measures are insufficient, surgical treatment is indicated. Though admittedly important, the quality of life (QoL) has been little studied in these patients, there are even contradictory results. The aim of this study was to evaluate QoL before and after bladder augmentation in patients with BN refractory to medical treatment. We analyzed, prospectively, the data of 67 patients who underwent surgical treatment for BN by questionnaire SF-36速 and Qualiveen速 QoL before and after six months of operation. Comparisons using paired t-tests and Wilcoxon and the assumption of normality was assessed using the Shapiro-Wilk test were made. According to the analysis of the SF-36速 questionnaire, the patients had higher QoL indices in the postoperative period in the areas functional capacity, general state of health, vitality, social aspects, emotional aspects and mental health (n = 67; p <0.05). The questionnaire also revealed Qualiveen速 best result in quality of life index in the postoperative period, and show lower specific negative impact by urinary problems (n = 36; p <0.05). The results show that, despite not being the main objective, the bladder augmentation results in significant improvement in QoL, probably related to the perception of better health and the resolution of urinary incontinence. Thus, the bladder augmentation associated with other urologic reconstruction techniques allows the upper urinary tract protection, and contribute to a better quality of life of patients with BN.
