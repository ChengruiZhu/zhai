Infective endocarditis is a potentially life threatening condition. It is associated with high mortality and morbidity resulting mostly due to cardiorespiratory failure. Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation is a modality of treatment used to support hypoxic respiratory failure especially in patients who are already on mechanical ventilation. Continuous renal replacement therapy is added mainly for maintaining fluid and electrolyte balance. Here we report a case series of patients diagnosed with infective endocarditis who were treated with combined extracorporeal membrane oxygenation and continuous renal replacement therapy. Three patients in the age group 20-60 years were admitted with clinical features suggestive of infective endocarditis. During the course of hospital stay they developed cardiorespiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation support for refractory hypoxia. It was complicated by heart failure, renal failure and fluid overload which required initiation of continuous renal replacement therapy. All the three patients succumbed in spite of the aggressive treatment. In addition to the role played by each complication, delayed start of continuous renal replacement therapy might have also contributed to the high mortality. Early initiation of continuous renal replacement therapy for management of fluid overload needs to be considered in the management of these critically ill patients.
