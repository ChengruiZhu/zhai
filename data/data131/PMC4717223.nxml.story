UCS had significantly worse overall survival (OS) compared with G3EC. Carcinosarcoma subtype was an independent factor (hazard ratio [HR], 2.4; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.0 to 5.8; p=0.039), stratified based on stage. Compared with G3EC, UCS patients had a greater incidence of ascites fluid (55.0% vs. 15.7%, p<0.001) and adnexal involvement (20.0% vs. 8.7%, p=0.048) and larger median tumor volume (4.6 cm vs. 4.0 cm, p=0.046). Subgroup analysis of the prognostic factors revealed that UCS patients exhibited worse OS than G3EC patients in such specific subgroups as patients at younger ages, with postmenopausal status, without ascites fluid, with early stage diseases, without vagina invasion, without lymph node metastases and receiving adjuvant chemo/radiotherapy. Adjuvant radiotherapy with chemotherapy was predictive of better survival in UCS patients compared with chemotherapy or radiotherapy alone (5-year OS, 71.0% vs. 35.8%, p=0.028). Multivariate Cox regression revealed that tumor mesenchymal component (HR, 4.6; 95% CI, 1.4 to 15.8; p=0.014) was an independent prognostic factor for UCS, whereas advanced stages (HR, 5.9; 95% CI, 1.0 to 33.9; p=0.046) and ascites fluid (HR, 5.1; 95% CI, 1.1 to 22.7; p=0.032) were independently correlated with poor prognosis for G3EC patients.
