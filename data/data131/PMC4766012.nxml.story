Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor (VEGF) is a protein with a fundamental role in development of vascular system. The protein, produced by many types of cells, is released in the blood. High levels of VEGF have been observed in different pathological conditions especially in cancer, cardiovascular, and inflammatory diseases. Therefore, identifying the genetic factors influencing VEGF levels is important for predicting and treating such pathologies. The number of genetic variants associated with VEGF levels has been limited. To identify new loci, we have performed a Genome Wide Association Study meta-analysis on a sample of more than 16,000 individuals from 10 cohorts, using a high-density genetic map. This analysis revealed 10 variants associated with VEGF circulating levels, 6 of these being novel associations. The 10 variants cumulatively explain more than 50% of the variability of VEGF serum levels. Our analyses have identified genes known to be involved in angiogenesis related diseases and genes implicated in platelet metabolism, suggesting the importance of links between this process and VEGF regulation. Overall, these data have improved our understanding of the genetic variation underlying circulating VEGF levels. This in turn could guide our response to the challenge posed by various VEGF-related pathologies.
