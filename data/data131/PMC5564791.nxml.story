This retrospective study was designed to determine the prognostic value of a cumulative score (FA score) based on pretreatment plasma fibrinogen and serum albumin levels for 326 patients newly diagnosed high-grade glioma (HGG). Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis was performed to determine the optimal cut-off values. Univariate and multivariate analysis were performed to evaluate the independent prognostic value of the FA scores associated with overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS). The optimal cut-off values were 2.815 g/L for fibrinogen and 43.65 g/L for albumin. PFS and OS were significantly worse for patients with higher FA scores. Patients with elevated fibrinogen level and decreased albumin levels had 3.00-fold higher risk of tumor progression and had a 3.23-fold higher risk of death compared with those with normal values. Multivariate analysis demonstrated FA score was an independent predictive factor for PFS and OS. Moreover, PFS and OS were better for the patients with lower FA score, either in patients with grade III or IV gliomas. These findings indicated that the pretreatment FA score could serve as a simple and noninvasive marker to predict the prognosis of patients with HGG.
