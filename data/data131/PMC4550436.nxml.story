In several areas of the developing brain, waves of electrical activity trace out distinct patterns across the nervous tissue. These waves are intricately involved in developmental processes that set up the structural connections of the adult brain, but it is unclear what role the wave patterns play. Here, we examine how the strength of connections in these brain areas may change by a process called spike-timing dependent plasticity, which is sensitive to the precise times at which individual neurons become electrically active. We use mathematical models and simulations to show that interactions between waves and plasticity build highly structured patterns into the connections. The results of our model are analogous to many cases of biological pattern formation seen, for example, in zebra stripes, leopard spots and seashells. An important connectivity pattern we consider is the receptive field, which determines to a large extent the specific function of a neuron. We demonstrate how pattern formation can refine the shape of a receptive field and therefore the specificity of a neuron, and explore several ways in which pattern formation may be disrupted, providing clues regarding pathologies in receptive field development. Our theory makes several predictions that may be tested using existing experimental paradigms.
