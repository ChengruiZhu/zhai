Although proton pump inhibitors (PPI) have a record of remarkable effectiveness and safety in the management of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), several treatment challenges with PPI have emerged. Dexlansoprazole MR is the (R)-enantiomer of lansoprazole contained in a formulation that produces two distinct releases of drug and significantly extends the duration of active plasma concentrations and % time pH > 4 beyond that of conventional single-release PPI. Dexlansoprazole MR can be administered without regard to meals or the timing of meals in most patients. Dexlansoprazole MR 60 mg demonstrated similar efficacy for healing of erosive esophagitis at 8 weeks compared with lansoprazole 30 mg, and dexlansoprazole MR 30 mg was superior to placebo for maintenance of healed erosive esophagitis at 6 months with 99% of nights and 96% of days heartburn-free over 6 months in patients taking dexlansoprazole MR 30 mg. Superior relief of heartburn occurred in patients taking dexlansoprazole MR 30 mg (55% heartburn-free 24-hour periods) vs placebo (14%) for symptomatic nonerosive GERD. The safety profile of dexlansoprazole MR is similar to that of lansoprazole. The extended pharmacodynamic effects, added convenience, and efficacy and safety of dexlansoprazole MR offer a novel approach to gastric pH control in patients with acid-related disorders.
