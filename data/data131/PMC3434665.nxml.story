The role of T lymphocytes in central nervous system (CNS) injuries is controversial, with inconsistent results reported concerning the effects of T-lymphocyte transfer on spinal cord injury (SCI). Here, we demonstrate that a specific T-lymphocyte subset enhances functional recovery after contusion SCI in mice. Intraperitoneal adoptive transfer of type 1 helper T (Th1)-conditioned cells 4 days after SCI promoted recovery of locomotor activity and tactile sensation and concomitantly induced regrowth of corticospinal tract and serotonergic fibers. However, neither type 2 helper T (Th2)- nor IL-17-producing helper T (Th17)-conditioned cells had such effects. Activation of microglia and macrophages were observed in the spinal cords of Th1-transfered mice after SCI. Specifically, M2 subtype of microglia/macrophages was upregulated after Th1 cell transfer. Neutralization of interleukin 10 secreted by Th1-conditioned cells significantly attenuated the beneficial effects by Th1-conditioned lymphocytes after SCI. We also found that Th1-conditioned lymphocytes secreted significantly higher levels of neurotrophic factor, neurotrophin 3 (NT-3), than Th2- or Th17-conditioned cells. Thus, adoptive transfer of pro-inflammatory Th1-conditioned cells has neuroprotective effects after SCI, with prospective implications in immunomodulatory treatment of CNS injury.
