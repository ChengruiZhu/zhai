Eukaryotic DNA synthesis is regulated with exquisite precision so that genomes are replicated exactly once before cell division occurs. In simple eukaryotes, chromosomal loci are preferentially replicated at specific times of S phase, in part because of their differential sensitivity to cell cycle regulators and in part as a result of random choice. Mammals, with âˆ¼250-fold larger genomes, have more complex replication programs, within which different classes of chromatin replicate at defined times. While the basic regulatory mechanisms in higher eukaryotes are conserved, it is unclear how their much more complex timing program is maintained. We use replication precursor analogues, which can be visualized in living or fixed cells, to monitor the spatial relationship of DNA domains that are replicated at different times of S phase. Analyzing individual chromosome, we show that a major mechanism regulating transitions in the S phase timing program involves the sequential activation of replication domains based on their genetic continuity. Our analysis of the mechanism of S phase progression in single cells provides an alternative to genome-wide strategies, which define patterns of replication using cell populations. In combination, these complimentary strategies provide fundamental insight into the mechanisms of S phase timing in mammalian cells.
