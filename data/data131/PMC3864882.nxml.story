H nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. The toxicity of the ternary bioconjugate (BC-PAMAM) was studied in vitro on BJ human normal skin fibroblasts and human squamous cell carcinoma (SCC-15) cell cultures in comparison with PAMAM G3, using three cytotoxicity assays (XTT, neutral red, and crystal violet) and an estimation of apoptosis by confocal microscopy detection. The tests have shown that BC-PAMAM has significantly lower cytotoxicity compared with PAMAM. Nonconjugated PAMAM was not cytotoxic at concentrations up to 5 μM (NR) and 10 μM (XTT), and BC-PAMAM was not cytotoxic up to 50 μM (both assays) for both cell lines. It has been also found that normal fibroblasts were more sensitive than SCC to both PAMAM and BC-PAMAM. The effect of PAMAM and BC-PAMAM on the initiation of apoptosis (PAMAM in fibroblasts at 5 μM and BC-PAMAM at 10 μM in both cell lines) corresponded with cytotoxicity assays for both cell lines. We concluded that normal fibroblasts are more sensitive to the cytotoxic effects of the PAMAM G3 dendrimer and that modification of its surface cationic groups by substitution with biologically active molecules significantly decreases that effect, confirming that PAMAM G3 is a useful candidate as a carrier for active biocompound delivery.
