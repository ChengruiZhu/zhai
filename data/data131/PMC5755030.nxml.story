MicroRNA-1470 (miR-1470) is overexpressed in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC); however, its role and underlying molecular mechanism remain unknown. The aim of the present study was to explore the tumorigenic role and mechanism of miR-1470 overexpression in ESCC. The expression of miR-1470 in ESCC tissues and cell lines was detected using human miRNA microarrays and the reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction, respectively. The effects of miR-1470 on cell proliferation, migration and senescence were determined using a Cell Counting Kit-8 assay, Transwell migration assay and Î²-galactosidase staining kit. Western blotting was used to analyze the expression levels of genes in the apoptosis signaling pathway. An increased expression level of miR-1470 was observed in ESCC tissues compared with that in paracancerous tissues. Knockdown of miR-1470 significantly suppressed proliferation, and down-regulated the cell cycle regulatory gene cyclin E1. It was also revealed that knockdown of miR-1470 significantly inhibited migration, and decreased the expression levels of matrix metalloproteinase 2 (MMP2), MMP13 and MMP14. Western blotting analysis revealed that knockdown of miR-1470 induced apoptosis by increasing B-cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2) expression. The results of the present study suggest that overexpression of miR-1470 in ESCC promotes cancer cell proliferation by accelerating the cell cycle and inhibiting apoptosis, and also enhances cancer cell migration by upregulating MMPs.
