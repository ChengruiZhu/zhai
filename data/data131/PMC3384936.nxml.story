Caudal regression syndrome (CRS) is a rare congenital vertebral anomaly, which occurs most often in combination with spinal cord malformations and morphologic dysfunctions of the lower extremities; these signs are useful for both patients and clinicians in the diagnosis of this syndrome. However, in certain cases, clinicians have failed to identify the syndrome due to the lack of apparent anomalies, resulting in the progression of renal dysfunction caused by neuropathic bladder when CRS is eventually identified. Here, we report a case of a 2-year-old girl who was referred to our hospital for vesicoureteral reflux. At examination, she presented no neurological symptoms; however, on cystourethrography and CT scanning we found that the sacral bone was absent, through which CRS was diagnosed. A urodynamic study indicated detrusor-sphincter dyssynergia, and clean intermittent catheterization was initiated. In the present report, we describe a case of CRS with no neurologic symptoms other than a neuropathic bladder. The lack of outward signs can result in delayed diagnosis. Thus, urological examinations, including a urodynamic study, might be the only clue for identifying an underlying neurologic injury involving the lower spinal cord.
