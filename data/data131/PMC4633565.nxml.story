Nifedipine is an antihypertensive BCS class II drug which has poor bioavailability when given orally. The objective of the present study was to increase the bioavailability of nifedipine, by formulation and evaluation of a buccoadhesive liquisolid system using magnesium aluminium silicate (Neusilin) as both carrier and coating material and dissolution media were selected based on the solubility studies. A mixture of carboxymethylcellulose sodium and carbomer was used as mucoadhesive polymers. Buccoadhesive tablets were prepared by direct compression. FTIR studies confirmed no interaction between drug and excipients. XRD studies indicated change/reduction in crystallinity of drug. The powder characteristics were evaluated by different flow parameters to comply with pharmacopoeial specifications. The dissolution studies for liquisolid compacts and tablet formulations were carried out and it was found that nifedipine liquisolid tablets formulated from bioadhesive polymers containing 49% liquisolid system, 17.5% carbomer, and 7.5% carboxymethylcellulose sodium showed the best results in terms of dissolution properties. Prepared formulation batches were evaluated for swelling, bioadhesion strength,
