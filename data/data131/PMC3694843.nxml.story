Changes in protein sequence or expression strength can both lead to adaptation in natural systems. While many studies have focused individually on either expression strength or protein sequence, in principle the fitness effects of these two protein properties are interdependent. We systematically investigated the fitness effects of both expression strength and protein sequence for the yeast Hsp90 gene (Hsp82). We analyzed the fitness effects of all possible point mutations in a putative substrate binding loop under seven different expression strengths. The fitness effects of amino acid substitutions were strongly dependent on expression strength. Many point mutations exhibited fitness defects at reduced expression strength that were hidden at the natural expression strength. Revealing these hidden mutant defects suggested that this region of Hsp90 contributes to a rate-limiting step in function, consistent with its putative role in substrate binding. This study is important because it indicates that critical regions in proteins are more prevalent than would be estimated based on experimental fitness analyses performed at natural expression strengths. As hidden fitness effects are likely to occur in other systems, these findings have broad implications for the field of experimental evolution.
