The coexistence of high and low divergence regions in the genomes of two incipient species can be informative about the process of speciation. For example, it may indicate a long period of continual gene flow during species formation. In the conventional view of speciation by geographical separation, there is little intermingling in the process, and the level of divergence should be relatively uniform across the genome. Domesticated plants and animals are excellent materials for studying speciation because the process of domestication may often exaggerate the forces that drive speciation. These forces include selection (artificial rather than natural) and admixture among diverging varieties mediated by humans. In this study, the authors analyzed the whole genome sequences between the two subspecies of domesticated rice. These subspecies have developed partial reproductive isolation. By studying the entire genomic patterns, as well as the detailed population genetics of 20 loci among 60 lines of cultivars and wild rice, the authors observed regions of unusually high divergence, which occupy more than 6% of the whole genome. Hence, the formation of domesticated rice resembles a process in which previously divergent populations/races were brought together, sorted, and re-assembled. How much this process may echo the formation of species in nature is discussed.
