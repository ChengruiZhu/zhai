We recorded the electrical activity of hundreds of neurons simultaneously in brain tissue from mice and we analyzed these signals using state-of-the-art tools from information theory. These tools allowed us to ascertain which neurons were transmitting information to other neurons and to characterize the computations performed by neurons using the inputs they received from two or more other neurons. We found that computations did not occur equally in all neurons throughout the networks. Surprisingly, neurons that computed large amounts of information tended to be recipients of information from neurons with a large number of outgoing connections. Interestingly, the number of incoming connections to a neuron was not related to the amount of information that neuron computed. To better understand these results, we built a network model to match the data. Unexpectedly, the model also maximized information transfer in the presence of network-wide correlations. This suggested a way that networks of cortical neurons could deal with common random background input. These results are the first to show that the amount of information computed by a neuron depends on where it is located in the surrounding network.
