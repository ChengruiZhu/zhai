Cytosolic glutathione transferases (cytGSTs) are a large and diverse superfamily of enzymes that have important roles in metabolism and defense against oxidative damage. They have been studied for several decades but because of the synthetic nature of the chemicals used to test these proteins to determine if they have cytGST activity, little is known about the physiological reactions and roles of cytGSTs. In this large, collaborative study, we constructed networks where more than 13,000 cytGST sequences were grouped by sequence similarity and then used these networks to prioritize new targets for experimental characterization in relatively unexplored regions of the superfamily. We report here experimental results confirming GST-like activity for 82 of them, along with 37 new three-dimensional molecular structures determined for 27 targets. These new data, along with experimental data previously reported in the literature, were painted onto the networks to generate a global view of their sequence-structure-function relationships. The results show how proteins of both known and unknown function relate to each other across the entire superfamily and illuminate the complex ways in which their variations in sequence and structure affect our ability to predict unknown functional properties.
