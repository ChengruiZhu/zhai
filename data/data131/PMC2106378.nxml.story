 in Veronal-acetate buffer at pH 7.4. Thin sections showed that in young spermatids the spindle fibers of the last maturation division are attached to satellites of the filament-forming centriole. In more mature spermatids this attachment is not observed. During the developmental phase, nine satellites can be observed emanating from the interspaces between the nine tubular triplets of this centriole. A circular region on each of the enlarged distal ends of the satellites attaches them to the cell membrane. The satellites apparently provide a firm anchor for the axial filament. Each of the epithelial cells covering the testis produces a single long flagellum. On the filament-forming centriole often a satellite can be observed to which tubules are attached. These tubules are 180 A in diameter and probably represent remnants of spindle fibers. It is suggested that the distal centriole has the ability to form several satellites or appendages at appropriate times during the cell cycle. These satellites are distinct from the daughter centrioles in that they are supportive structures: in certain phases of cell life, spindle fibers may attach to them, while in other instances the distal centriole and the flagellum it is forming are anchored by them.
