Forehead osteomas are benign but can pose aesthetic and functional problems. These osteomas are resected via bicoronal or endoscopic approach. However, large osteomas cannot be removed via endoscopic approach, and bicoronal approach can result in damage to the supraorbital nerve with resultant numbness in the forehead. We present a new approach to resection of forehead osteomas, with access provided by an anterior hairline incision and subcutaneous dissection. Three patients underwent resection of the forehead osteoma through an anterior hairline incision. The dissection was carried in the subcutaneous plane, and the frontalis muscle and periosteum were divided parallel to the course of supraorbital nerve. The resulting bony defect was re-contoured using MedporÂ®. All three patients recovered without any postoperative infection or complication and symptoms. Scalp sensory was preserved. Aesthetic outcomes were satisfactory. Patients remain free of recurrence for 12 months of follow up. The anterior hair line approach with subcutaneous dissection is an effective method for removal of forehead osteoma, since it offers broad visualization and hides the scar in the hairline. In addition, the dissection in the subcutaneous plane avoids inadvertent injury to the deep nerve branches and helps to maintains scalp sensation.
