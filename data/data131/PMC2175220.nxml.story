In this report, we have analyzed the potential role and mechanisms of integrin signaling through FAK in cell cycle regulation by using tetracycline-regulated expression of exogenous FAK and mutants. We have found that overexpression of wild-type FAK accelerated G1 to S phase transition. Conversely, overexpression of a dominant-negative FAK mutant ΔC14 inhibited cell cycle progression at G1 phase and this inhibition required the Y397 in ΔC14. Biochemical analyses indicated that FAK mutant ΔC14 was mislocalized and functioned as a dominant-negative mutant by competing with endogenous FAK in focal contacts for binding signaling molecules such as Src and Fyn, resulting in a decreases of Erk activation in cell adhesion. Consistent with this, we also observed inhibition of BrdU incorporation and Erk activation by FAK Y397F mutant and FRNK, but not FRNKΔC14, in transient transfection assays using primary human foreskin fibroblasts. Finally, we also found that ΔC14 blocked cyclin D1 upregulation and induced p21 expression, while wild-type FAK increased cyclin D1 expression and decreased p21 expression. Taken together, these results have identified FAK and its associated signaling pathways as a mediator of the cell cycle regulation by integrins.
