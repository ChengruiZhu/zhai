A common genetic lesion leading to hematological cancer is the creation of fusion genes as a result of reciprocal translocations between chromosomes. Such translocations are non-random, in the sense that certain genes are more likely to be fused than others, and they appear to be tissue-specific. Current models tend to explain the non-random nature of chromosomal translocations suggesting that chromosome breaks are favored at certain sites and that the distance between genes in the nucleus determines the probability of their being fused together. In this work we have analyzed several genomic features in a large collection of genes involved in chromosomal translocations in hematological cancers, using robust computational methods. Our findings suggest that nuclear distance is a general pre-requisite but does not determine the specific combinations of genes fused together. We find that genomic features related to transcription and replication, together with constraints derived from the functional domains present in the proteins encoded by fusion genes, better explain which genes participate in specific chromosomal translocations and the tissue types in which they are found. The association of such genomic features with the position occupied by genes in the nucleus explains the apparent causal role attributed to spatial position.
