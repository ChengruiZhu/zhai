Exosome-encapsulated microRNAs have been recognized as novel and stable biomarkers for cancer. However, little is known about the role of exosomal microRNAs in colon cancer. In the present study, we investigated the expression of serous exosomal microRNA-638 (miR-638) and its prognostic effect in patients with colon cancer. Serous exosomal samples were assayed by quantitative real-time PCR. Kaplan-Meier analysis was adopted to determine the overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS) of colon cancer patients. Cox regression analysis was applied to assess the potential association between serous exosomal miR-638 and clinicopathological factors of colon cancer patients. MiR-638 was significantly reduced in serum exosomes of colon cancer patients compared with healthy controls. Decreased level of serous exosomal miR-638 was more significant in colon cancer patients at later TNM stage or with liver metastasis. Kaplan-Meier analysis showed that colon cancer patients with reduced level of serous exosomal miR-638 had poor OS and DFS. In addition, the Cox regression analysis suggested serous exosomal miR-638 was a prognostic factor for colon cancer independent of TNM stage and liver metastasis. In conclusion, serous exosomal miR-638 is a useful biomarker for the prediction of colon cancer prognosis.
