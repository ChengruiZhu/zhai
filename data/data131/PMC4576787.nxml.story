Prevalence of IBS varies in different studies from 28% in a Croatian study, to 14% in Romania. Most studies report a higher prevalence in females. Stressful events are linked to the impairment of symptoms. Anxiety and depression are common in IBS patients, showing similar expression of functional symptoms. Quality of life is impaired. The role of abuse (physical, sexual) is not commonly investigated and when it was, the importance of this factor was revealed to be much less important than in Western Europe or North America. General practitioners seem to be well trained to recognize IBS, to make correct interpretations of the disease and to use the correct therapy. It seems that the Rome criteria are known and applied by general practitioners. Several epidemiological studies on IBS exist in most EE countries. Usually they look for self-reporting symptoms, or reports from endoscopy units. Psychosomatic approach of IBS was taken into consideration in several countries (Poland, Hungary, Romania), mainly by psychologists and psychotherapists rather than by gastroenterologists.
