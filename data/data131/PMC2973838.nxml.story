Most organisms are able to rhythmically coordinate their physiology and metabolism in consonance with the day-night cycle. The cellular mechanism responsible for generating the biological rhythms is known as circadian clock. In contrast to many other biochemical reactions, the pace of the clock does not change with temperature (i.e. the clock does not run faster at high temperatures). This is a property known as clock temperature compensation, and despite its importance for circadian function, we know few details about the mechanisms responsible for the temperature-dependent regulation of circadian period length. Plants, as sessile organisms, are particularly sensible to maintaining the clock running at the proper pace, regardless the external temperature. In our study, we have identified that the activity of two key plant clock components (CK2 and CCA1) is regulated by temperature. Notably, these temperature-dependent activities are antagonistic, and they counterbalance each other at increasing temperatures so that the clock does not run faster at these high temperatures. When we alter the expression and activity of CK2 and CCA1, we observe that the clock is not longer able to maintain the proper pace, thus demonstrating that the balance between these two activities is essential for clock temperature compensation in plants.
