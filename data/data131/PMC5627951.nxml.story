Guard cells, located in pairs on the surface of plant leaves, circumscribe microscopic pores called stomata, through which plants take up gaseous carbon dioxide that will be fixed by photosynthesis into sugars. However, plants also inevitably lose water vapor to the atmosphere through open stomata. Under drought conditions, the plant hormone abscisic acid (ABA) causes volume changes in guard cells that result in stomatal closure, thereby restricting water loss. Given the paramount importance of drought tolerance for plant survival, it is important to understand the cellular mechanisms underlying guard cell response to ABA, and over 100 studies in the literature have addressed this topic. We synthesized this information into a network that contains 84 cellular components and 156 interactions between them and then applied logic-based analyses to predict how these components coordinately transduce the ABA signal. We identified several positive feedback loops and mutual inhibition loops that can lead to sustained activity of their constituent components in the presence, or absence, of ABA. Control of these loops, for example, by other stimuli present in the natural environment, may sensitize the system to ABA. We validated some of the novel predictions from our model with new experiments.
