There were no significant differences between SSC patients and controls regarding left ventricular (LV) systolic functions and two-dimensional (2-D) atrial diameters. Presence of LV diastolic dysfunction (LVDD) was evaluated and graded according to recommendations of the American Society of Echocardiography. Accordingly, LVDD was observed to be significantly more frequent in SSc patients; 16 SSc patients (39%) and 5 controls (12.8%) were observed to have LVDD (p=0.007). With regard to results obtained from RT3DE, LA maximum, minimum, and before atrial contraction volumes were significantly higher (40.5±14.6 vs. 32.6±8.9, 15.5±8.4 vs. 9.9±3.5 and 28.7±11.7 vs. 21.4±7.0 mL respectively, p<0.05 for all), whereas LA active emptying fraction, LA total emptying fraction, LA expansion index, and passive emptying fraction values were significantly (47.1±12.0 vs. 52.9±10.1%, 62.8±10.5 vs. 69.5±6.7%, 187.5±76.0 vs. 246.6±96.0, 29.6±9.3 vs. 34.4±11.0% respectively, p<0.05 for all) in SSc patients than in controls. In addition, regarding results obtained from speckle tracking echocardiography, atrial peak-systolic longitudinal strain (e), early negative strain rate (SR), late negative SR, and peak positive SR values were observed to be significantly lower in SSc patients.
