In the cell cycle, duplication of all the cellular components and subsequent cell division are governed by a family of protein kinases associated with cyclins (CDKs). Related CDK4 and CDK6 bound to cyclins D are the first CDKs to be activated in response to cell proliferation signals. They thus play a central role in the cell multiplication decision, especially in most cancer cells in which CDK4 activity is highly deregulated. We have identified the activating T172 phosphorylation instead of cyclin D expression as the highly regulated step determining CDK4 activation. This finding contrasts with the prevalent view that the only identified metazoan CDK-activating kinase, CDK7, is constitutively active. By using human cells genetically engineered for specific chemical inhibition of CDK7, we found that CDK7 activity was indeed required for CDK4 activation. However, this dependence was conditioned by CDK4 binding to the CDK inhibitory protein p21, which increased in response to CDK7 inhibition. Further investigation revealed that CDK7 inhibition affects a major phosphorylation of p21, which we found to be required for CDK4 activation and performed by CDK4 itself and CDK2. Thus, depending on CDK7 activity, CDK4 and CDK2 facilitate CDK4 activation, generating novel positive feedbacks involved in the cell cycle decision.
