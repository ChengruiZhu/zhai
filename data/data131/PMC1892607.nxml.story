The cooperative movements within a protein concerning the binding and dissociation of the reactants and products could be important for protein function. Communication among the various parts of an enzyme can be achieved by the networks connecting amino acids through peptide backbone connections and nonbonded amino acid contact. We used dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR), a clinically important enzyme, as an example to explore the effects of amino acid communication on protein functions. We found that the peptide chain itself is an efficient “telephone wire” to transfer the communications. Breaking the telephone wire (peptide chain) at different points leads to differentiated behavior near the enzyme active site. The important points to keep the peptide chain communication are coupled with the place where protein folding occurs. On the other hand, ligand binding to the enzyme active site provides a “short cut” to the communication networks, with most of the interaction networks now passing through the added ligand and shortening the average communication path. We considered the short cuts to be “network-bridging effects” in the protein structure. The enzyme active site is the place where the short cut has the most dramatic effect in modifying protein communication networks.
