Survivin and Plk1 kinase are important mediators of cell survival that are required for chromosome alignment, cytokinesis, and protection from apoptosis. Interference with either survivin or Plk1 activity manifests many similar outcomes: prometaphase delay/arrest, multinucleation, and increased apoptosis. Moreover, the expression of both survivin and Plk1 is deregulated in cancer. Given these similarities, we speculated that these two proteins may cooperate during mitosis and/or in cell death pathways. Here we report that survivin and Plk1 interact during mitosis and that Plk1 phosphorylates survivin at serine 20. Importantly, we find that overexpression of a non-phosphorylatable version, S20A, is unable to correct chromosomes connected to the spindle in a syntelic manner during prometaphase and allows cells harboring these maloriented chromosomes to enter anaphase, evading the spindle tension checkpoint. By contrast, the constitutive phosphomimic, S20D, completes congression and division ahead of schedule and, unlike S20A, is able to support proliferation in the absence of the endogenous protein. Despite the importance of this residue in mitosis, its mutation does not appear to affect the anti-apoptotic activity of survivin in response to TRAIL. Together, these data suggest that phosphorylation of survivin at Ser
