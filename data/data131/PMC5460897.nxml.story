Which factors shape the sequence of amino acids that will form a protein? The biochemical features of amino acids, such as their charge and hydrophobicity, are important drivers of protein tridimensional folding, which creates interaction sites for binding other molecules and directs proteins to specific cellular compartments. These features all impact the activity of the proteins after they are produced. Another less obvious factor that influences the proteinâ€™s primary structure may be how efficiently a given amino acid sequence is produced by the ribosome. It is known that a repetitive stretch of positively charged amino acids may interact with the negative charges in the ribosome exit tunnel, slowing, or even halting, translation. By analyzing the charge of protein stretches in different organisms, we observed that proteins tend to present positively charged stretches at their extremities, and high charge values can slow (for positive charges) or speed (for negative charges) translation. An interesting consequence of this trend is that proteins that are translated in high quantities by several ribosomes at the same RNA (polysomes) tend to have more negatively charged stretches than proteins that are translated by a single ribosome per RNA (monosomes).
