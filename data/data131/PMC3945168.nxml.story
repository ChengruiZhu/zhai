Recent evidence suggests that, like many normal tissues, many cancers are maintained by a small population of immortal stem cells that divide indefinitely to produce many differentiated cells. Cancer stem cells may come directly from mutation of normal stem cells, but this route demands high mutation rates, because there are few normal stem cells. There are, however, many differentiated cells, and mutations can cause such cells to “dedifferentiate” into a stem-like state. We used mathematical modeling to study the effects of dedifferentiation on the time to cancer onset. We found that the effect of dedifferentiation depends critically on how stem cell numbers are controlled by the body. If homeostasis is very tight (due to all divisions being asymmetric), then dedifferentiation has little effect, but if homeostatic control is looser (allowing both symmetric and asymmetric divisions), then dedifferentiation can dramatically hasten cancer onset and lead to exponential growth of the cancer stem cell population. Our results suggest that dedifferentiation may be a very important factor in cancer and that more study of dedifferentiation and stem cell control is necessary to understand and prevent cancer onset.
