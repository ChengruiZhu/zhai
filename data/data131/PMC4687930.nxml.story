While recent genetic association studies in human populations have succeeded in identifying genetic loci that contribute to coronary artery disease (CAD) and related phenotypes, these loci explain only a small fraction of the genetic variation in CAD and associated traits. Here, we present a complementary approach using association analysis of atherosclerotic traits among inbred strains of mice. A strength of this approach is that it enables in-depth phenotypic characterization including gene expression and metabolic profiling across a variety of tissues, and integration of these molecular phenotypes with coronary artery disease itself. A striking finding was the large fraction of atherosclerosis that was explained by genetic interactions. Association analysis allowed us to identify genetic loci for atherosclerotic lesion area as well as transcript, cytokine and metabolite levels, and relationships among the traits were examined by correlation and network modeling. The plasma metabolites associated with atherosclerosis in mice, namely, LDL/VLDL-cholesterol, TMAO, arginine, glucose and insulin, overlapped with those observed in humans and accounted for approximately 30 to 40% of the observed variation in atherosclerotic lesion area. In summary, our data provide a detailed overview of the genetic architecture of atherosclerosis in mice and a rich resource for studies of the complex genetic and metabolic interactions that underlie the disease.
