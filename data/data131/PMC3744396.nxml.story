Vasopressin is a hormone that is secreted from specialised brain cells into the bloodstream; it acts at the kidneys to control water excretion, and thereby help to maintain a stable ‘osmotic pressure’. Specialised cells in the brain sense osmotic pressure, and generate electrical signals which the thousands of vasopressin neurons process and respond to by producing and secreting vasopressin. In response to these signals, vasopressin neurons generate complex “phasic” patterns of electrical activity, and this activity leads to vasopressin secretion in a complex way that depends on both the rate and pattern of this activity. We have now built a computational model that describes both how the vasopressin neurons generate electrical activity and also how that activity leads to secretion. The model, which gives a very close fit to experimental data, allows us to explore the adaptive advantages of particular features of the vasopressin neurons. This analysis reveals the importance of heterogeneity in the properties of vasopressin neurons, and shows how the vasopressin system is optimally designed to maintain a consistent hormonal output in conditions where its stores of releasable hormone are severely depleted.
