Epilepsy, a group of chronic disorders characterized by recurrent seizures, results from abnormal, synchronized neuronal activity in the brain. The mouse represents a powerful system to study novel mutations that model neurological disease, including epilepsy. Here we describe a new mouse mutation (“fitful”) in the gene encoding dynamin-1. Fitful mice have recurrent seizures and other neurological defects, including impaired hearing. Dynamin-1 is very well studied, but has yet to be linked to neurological disease. Dynamin-1 is a large multimeric enzyme that functions in membrane fission, primarily of vesicles after they release neurotransmitter at neuronal synapses. Fitful occurs in the region of dynamin-1 that is important for self-assembly of single dynamin subunits into the multimers required for enzymatic function. We show that fitful interferes with dynamin-1 self-assembly and with endocytosis. Moreover, the mutation resides in one of two alternate forms of dynamin-1 and affects what may be a necessary shift during brain development, with the expression of the mutated form being higher after maturation in fitful mice. This particular genetic specialization is unique to vertebrate dynamin. We speculate that specialized forms of dynamin-1 are important for modifying the self-assembly process to meet the demands complex brain activity in higher organisms.
