For many decades, the study of oscillatory brain activity focused on the separate analysis of its different frequency bands (from delta to gamma). However, neurons, and neuronal populations are nonlinear systems, and a sinusoidal input will produce new frequency components in their output. This induces cross-frequency coupling (CFC) between any two sources (e.g. neuronal populations, or brain regions) when there are bidirectional connections between them, as is often the case in the brain. Cascades of nonlinear sources can also produce CFC between sources that are not directly connected. Although several types of CFC are possible, there is an increasing interest in phase-amplitude coupling (PAC), the phenomenon where the amplitude of a high frequency oscillation (e.g. gamma) is modulated by the phase of a lower frequency (e.g. theta). PAC has been hypothesized to mediate the integration of distributed information in the brain, but the exact local and global mechanisms responsible for this processing remain unknown. Here we focus on the generation of PAC at the local scale, in the cortical column, and study how the biophysics of the neuronal populations involved, influence the generation of the phenomenon. Our results highlight the importance of the topology of the cortical column network on the generation of PAC, and show that indirect PAC connections can be predicted by a cascade of direct same-frequency coupling (SFC) and CFC connections.
