Imatinib mesylate (Gleevec) is currently the standard treatment for chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) and elicits a large reduction in leukemic cell burden in most patients. However, strong evidence suggests that imatinib does not cure the disease; approximately 20% of patients relapse within three years, and discontinuation of imatinib therapy often leads to a rebound of the leukemic cell burden. Laboratory studies have suggested that there exists a subpopulation of “quiescent” leukemia cells (i.e., cells that do not divide) that may be insensitive to imatinib treatment. It has been postulated that the disease outcome may be improved by administering imatinib in conjunction with the Granulocyte-Colony Stimulating Factor (G-CSF), a growth factor which “wakes up” the quiescent stem cells and sensitizes them to imatinib. In this study, we design a novel mathematical model of stem cell quiescence to investigate the treatment response to imatinib and G-CSF. We find that adding G-CSF to an imatinib treatment protocol leads to observable effects only if the majority of leukemic stem cells are quiescent. Our model also predicts that adding G-CSF leads to a higher risk of resistance, since it increases the number of leukemic stem cell divisions and thus the probability of acquiring a resistance mutation.
