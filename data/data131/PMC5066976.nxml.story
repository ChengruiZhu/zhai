Antibodies must recognize a great diversity of antigens to protect us from infectious disease. The binding properties of antibodies are determined by the DNA sequences of their corresponding B cell receptors (BCRs). These BCR sequences are created in naive form by VDJ recombination, which randomly selects and trims the ends of V, D, and J genes, then joins the resulting segments together with additional random nucleotides. If they pass initial screening and bind an antigen, these sequences then undergo an evolutionary process of reproduction, mutation, and selection, revising the BCR to improve binding to its cognate antigen. It has recently become possible to determine the BCR sequences resulting from this process in high throughput. Although these sequences implicitly contain a wealth of information about both antigen exposure and the process by which we learn to resist pathogens, this information can only be extracted using computer algorithms. In this paper we describe a likelihood-based statistical method to determine, given a collection of BCR sequences, which of them are derived from the same recombination events. It is based on a hidden Markov model (HMM) of VDJ rearrangement which is able to calculate likelihoods for many sequences at once.
