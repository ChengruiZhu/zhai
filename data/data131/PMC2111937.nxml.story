When isolated chromaffin granules were aggregated by synexin (a Ca2+- binding protein present in chromaffin and other secretory tissues) and then exposed to cis-unsaturated fatty acids at 37 degrees C, they fused together to form large vesicles. The fusion was monitored by phase and electron microscopy and by turbidity measurements on the granule suspension. Arachidonic acid was the most effective fusogen, whereas trans-unsaturated fatty acids, saturated fatty acids, detergents or lysolecithin were inactive. During fusion some of the epinephrine of the granules was released but the soluble core proteins remained trapped in the resulting vesicles. These vesicles swelled to enclose the maximum volume. Although this swelling could be inhibited by increasing the osmotic strength of the medium, it did not appear to depend on the chemiosmotic properties of the granule membranes as it was not influenced by ATP, a proton ionophore, or an anion transport inhibitor. The regulators of this in vitro fusion--Ca2+, synexin, and free, cis-unsaturated fatty acids--may be present in the cytoplasm of the chromaffin cell when it is stimulated to release epinephrine and granule proteins by exocytosis. Therefore, this fusion event may be the same that occurs between chromaffin granules undergoing compound exocytosis.
