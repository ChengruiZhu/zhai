During inflammation, circulating proinflammatory cytokines such as TNFα, IL-1ß, and IL-6, which are produced by, e.g., Kupffer cells, macrophages, or tumor cells, play important roles in hepatocellular signaling pathways and in the regulation of cellular homeostasis. In particular, these cytokines are responsible for the acute phase response (APR) but also for a dramatic reduction of drug detoxification capacity due to impaired expression of numerous genes coding for drug metabolic enzymes and transporters. Here we used high-throughput (phospho-)proteomic and gene expression data to investigate the impact of canonical signaling pathways in mediating IL-6-induced downregulation of drug metabolism related genes. We performed chemical inhibition perturbations to show that most of the IL-6 effects on gene expression are mediated through the MAPK and PI3K/AKT pathways. We constructed a prior knowledge network as basis for a fuzzy logic model that was trained with extensive gene expression data to identify critical regulatory nodes. Our results suggest that the nuclear receptor RXRα plays a central role, which was convincingly validated by RXRα gene silencing experiments. This work shows how computational modeling can support identifying decisive regulatory events from large-scale experimental data.
