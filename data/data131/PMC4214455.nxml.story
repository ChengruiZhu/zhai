 cytotoxicity in the BIU-87 bladder cancer cell line following the blockade of the B7-H4 signaling pathway were also analyzed. The results showed that in normal bladder tissues, B7-H4 was not detected, but in the bladder urothelial carcinoma tissue samples, B7-H4 was detected in 24/49 (49.0%) specimens. Additionally, positive B7-H4 expression was significantly associated with increased TNM stage and pathological grade (P<0.05). Compared with the healthy control group, the serum-B7-H4 (sB7-H4) concentrations in the patients were also significantly increased (P<0.05). The sB7-H4 concentrations in cases with high-grade histology were significantly higher than those in patients with low-grade histology (P<0.05). Following the blockade of the B7-H4 antigen in BIU-87 cells, the cytotoxic activity of activated T cells against such BIU-87 cells was significantly enhanced compared with that against the control BIU-87 cells. This occurred in a T cell density-dependent and blocking antibody dose-dependent manner. These observations suggest that B7-H4 is involved in tumor occurrence, and the development and immune escape of bladder urothelial carcinoma cells. Therefore, B7-H4 may be an important target in the diagnosis and/or treatment of bladder urothelial carcinoma.
