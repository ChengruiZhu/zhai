Brain metastases from gastrointestinal malignancies are exceedingly rare occurrences that carry a very poor prognosis. This holds especially true in cases where brain metastases from esophageal primaries are the initial presentation of a previously unidentified gastrointestinal malignancy. Our patient, a 60-year-old male with a past history of a right temporal teratoma, family history of breast cancer, and no smoking history, presented with a chief complaint of recurrent headaches. His history of present illness and physical examination included a two-month history of frontal headache, progressive fatigue, and unintentional weight loss. He underwent an extensive initial workup including CT-head, CT-abdomen/pelvis, CT-chest, bone scan, tumor marker analysis, and MRI-brain. The initial head CT revealed multiple intracranial lesions suspicious for malignancy. A PET scan later revealed his primary to be a malignancy of the distal esophagus. His treatment course thus far has been aggressive, consisting of surgical resection, systemic chemotherapy with capcetibine-oxaliplatin as well as paclitaxel-carboplatin, and radiation therapy. He has had several recurrences since starting treatment, but has continued to maintain a good performance status with only minor symptoms. Currently, the patient has survived for 17 months after his diagnosis of stage IV (T3, N2, M1) moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma and is undergoing treatment with trastuzumab and stereotactic radiosurgery. This report demonstrates that although cases of esophageal adenocarcinoma that present as brain metastases typically carry a poor prognosis, with early and aggressive treatment patients can survive well past one year after diagnosis.
