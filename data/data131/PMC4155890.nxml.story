A thorough background in craniofacial growth and development is necessary for every dentist. An important concept in the study of growth and development is variability. Cephalometrics is an important part of morphological diagnostic procedures to assess craniofacial growth and development. The aim of this study was to obtain cephalometric norms for Mewari children of Rajasthan by Steiner analysis and compare with Caucasian norms. The method involved clinical examination, collection and analysis of 100 lateral cephalometric radiographs of Mewari children (50 males and 50 females, between 11 and 13 years of age). All cephalometric landmarks were located and determined and subsequently tracing was done according to Steiner analysis. The mean value and standard deviation of each measurement were calculated. Statistical comparison was done using Student t-test. The result of this study showed that the Mewari children had retrusion of mandible relative to cranial base, proclined maxillary and mandibular teeth, with greater convexity of face. They also showed anteriorly placed occlusal plane to cranium and Less prominent chin. In conclusion, these ethnic differences should be considered during orthodontic treatment.
