IQ·SPECT (Siemens Medical Solutions) is a solution for high-sensitivity and short-time acquisition imaging of the heart for a variable angle general purpose gamma camera. It consists of a multi-focal collimator, a cardio-centric orbit and advanced iterative reconstruction, modeling the image formation physics accurately. The multi-focal collimator enables distance-dependent enlargement of the center region while avoiding truncation at the edges. With the specified configuration and a cardio-centric orbit it can obtain a fourfold sensitivity increase for the heart at the center of the scan orbit. Since IQ·SPECT shows characteristic distribution patterns in the myocardium, appropriate acquisition and processing conditions are required, and normal databases are convenient for quantification of both normal and abnormal perfusion images. The use of prone imaging can be a good option when X-ray computed tomography (CT) is not available for attenuation correction. CT-based attenuation correction changes count distribution significantly in the inferior wall and around the apex, hence image interpretation training and additional use of normal databases are recommended.
