Acute myocardial infarction (AMI), commonly known as heart attack, is a medical emergency that is potentially fatal if not promptly and pro- perly managed. The early diagnosis of AMI is critically important for the timely institution of pharmacotherapy to prevent myocardial damage and preserve cardiac function. Ischemic insults during AMI cause myocardial tissue damage, releasing the cardiac muscle protein troponin T into the blood stream. Therefore, serum troponin T levels are used as a sensitive and specific indicator of myocardial injury for diagnosing AMI. However, there remains a requirement for developing technologies for more accurate biomarkers or signatures for AMI diagnosis or prognosis. Previous studies have implicated impaired lipid metabolism as a causative factor in AMI development. Lipoproteins are important constituents of lipid metabolism; their levels in the blood stream are a convenient biomarker tool for monitoring lipid metabolism. This review summarizes recent findings (data of studies from 2001 to 2016) regarding the biomarker potentials of various lipoproteins, including low-density lipoprotein, oxidized low-density lipoprotein, high-density lipoprotein, lipoprotein-a, and remnant lipoprotein, for the risk stratification of AMI.
