Polo-like kinase 1 (PLK1) is a multi-functional protein and its aberrant expression is a driver of cancerous transformation and progression. To increase our understanding of the clinical value and potential molecular mechanism of PLK1 in gastric cancer (GC), we performed this comprehensive investigation. A total of 25 datasets and 12 publications were finally incorporated. Additional immunohistochemistry was conducted to validate the expression pattern of PLK1 in GC. The pooled standard mean deviation (SMD) indicated that PLK1 mRNA was up-regulated in GC (SMD=1.21, 95% CI: 0.65-1.77, P< 0.001). Similarly, the pooled odds ratio (OR) revealed that PLK1 protein was overexpressed in GC compared with normal gastric tissue (OR=12.12, 95% CI: 5.41-27.16, P<0.001). The area under the curve (AUC) of the summary receiver operating characteristic (SROC) curve was 0.86. Furthermore, our results demonstrated that GC patients with PLK1 overexpression were significantly associated with unfavorable overall survival (HR =1.54, 95% CI: 1.30–1.83, P<0.001), lymph node metastasis (OR = 1.78, 95% CI: 1.13–2.80, P=0.013) and advanced TNM stage (OR=1.48, 95% CI: 1.02-2.15, P=0.038). Altogether, 100 similar genes were identified by Gene Expression Profiling Interactive Analysis (GEPIA) and further with gene-set enrichment analysis. These genes were related to gene ontology (GO) terms and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathways relevant to the cell cycle. Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) indicated that PLK1 is associated with various cancer-related pathways. Collectively, this study suggests that PLK1 overexpression could play vital roles in the carcinogenesis and deterioration of GC via regulating tumor-related pathways.
