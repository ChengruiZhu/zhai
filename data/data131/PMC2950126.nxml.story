, for example, a ligand of the epidermal growth factor family called Spitz (Spi) is secreted from both the apical and basal (axonal) poles of photoreceptor cells but with different outcomes. Photoreceptor cells are recruited to the developing eye following apical secretion of Spi. Conversely, basal secretion of this same ligand, at a significant distance from the cell body, triggers differentiation of cells in the outer layer of the brain. Although secretion of Spi is known to occur at both poles of the cell, one important question is how Spi and its processing machinery are trafficked throughout the length of the photoreceptor axon to achieve basal secretion. In this study we show that the key to axonal trafficking is the regulated localization of Spi and its processing machinery, including the intramembrane protease Rhomboid, to sites within the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), which extends along the length of the axon. Two different Rhomboid proteins are expressed in photoreceptor cells, but only one of them is localized to the ER. We show that this ER-localized Rhomboid is indeed necessary and sufficient for Spi processing at axon termini. Our work therefore demonstrates how variations in intracellular localization of conserved signaling components can alter signaling outcomes dramatically. It also highlights the importance of the ER in trafficking proteins along the axon.
