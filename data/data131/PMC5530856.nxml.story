Exogenous ILK enhanced the proliferation, migration and invasion properties of A2780 and SK-OV-3 cells. After treatment with emodin, the survival rate of cells was gradually reduced, including those of SK-OV-3/pLVX-ILK and A2780/pLVX-ILK cells, with increasing emodin concentrations. The migration and invasion abilities of A2780 and SK-OV-3 cells were effectively increased by the transfection of pLVX-ILK, which could be abrogated by following this with 48 hours of emodin treatment. Treatment with emodin significantly downregulated the expression of ILK and EMT-related proteins. So, emodin suppressed proliferation, migration and invasion in ovarian cancer cells by downregulating ILK in vitro. SK-OV-3/pLVX-Con and SK-OV-3/pLVX-ILK cells were used to generate xenografts in nude mice. Tumors grew more rapidly in the SK-OV-3/pLVX-ILK group compared with the control group, and this could be significantly inhibited by emodin. Also, the expression of E-cadherin was downregulated, while the expression of Slug, MMP-9 and Vimentin were upregulated in the SK-OV-3/pLVX-ILK group, and this could be reversed by following treatment with emodin. Emodin did not demonstrate target toxicity on hepatocytes, nephrocytes and cardiomyocytes.
