 and the development of tumor tissues, both of which are modulated by crosstalk between cancer cells and the surrounding microenvironment. Advances in cancer research have highlighted the significance of constant evolution of the tumor microenvironment, leading to tumor formation, metastasis and refractoriness to therapy. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small non-coding RNAs that function as major players of posttranscriptional gene regulation in diverse biological processes. They function as both tumor suppressors and promoters in many aspects of the autonomous behavior of cancer cells. Theoretically, dysfunction in the gene regulatory networks of cancer cells is one of the major driving forces for alterations of ostensibly normal surrounding cells. In this context, the core targets of miRNAs, termed miRNA regulons, are currently being expanded to include various modulators of the tumor microenvironment. Recent advances have highlighted two important roles played by miRNAs in the evolution of tumor microenvironments: miRNAs in tumor cells transform the microenvironment via non-cell-autonomous mechanisms, and miRNAs in neighboring cells stabilize cancer hallmark traits. These observations epitomize the distal and proximal functions of miRNAs in tumor microenvironments, respectively. Such regulation by miRNAs affects tumor angiogenesis, immune invasion and tumorâ€“stromal interactions. This review summarizes recent findings on the mechanisms of miRNA-mediated regulation of tumor microenvironments, with a perspective on the design of therapeutic interventions.
