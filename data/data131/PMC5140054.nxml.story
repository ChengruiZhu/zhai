Since the early days of theoretical population genetics. scientists have debated the role of population size in shaping evolutionary dynamics. Do large populations possess an evolutionary advantage towards complexity due to the strength of natural selection in these populations? Or do small populations have the advantage, as genetic drift allows small populations to cross fitness valleys that large populations are unlikely to traverse? There are many theories that predict whether large or small populations–those with strong selection or those with strong drift–should evolve the greatest complexity. Here, we use digital experimental evolution to examine the interplay between population size and the evolution of complexity. We found that genetic drift could lead to increased genome size and phenotypic complexity in very small populations. However, large populations also evolved large genomes and phenotypic complexity. Small populations evolved larger genomes through the fixation of slightly deleterious insertions, while large populations used rare beneficial insertions. Our results suggest that both strong drift and strong selection can allow populations to evolve similar complexity, but through different evolutionary trajectories.
