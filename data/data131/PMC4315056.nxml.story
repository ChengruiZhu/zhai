Penile cancer is an extremely rare form of urological cancer that usually originates in the epithelium of the inner preputium or glans. Major etiological factors include phimosis, poor penile hygiene and smoking. Nearly 95% of penile cancers are squamous cell carcinomas and usually occur in the sixth decade of life. The disease exhibits two variants, namely metastatic and atypical disease. Squamous differentiation may also present with mucinous metaplasia. An extremely limited number of case reports on penile cancer are available in the literature. The present study reports the case of a 39-year-old patient with penile mucinous adenocarcinoma who was admitted with the complaint of perineal discharge, which is, to the best of our knowledge, the first case in the literature. The patient underwent total penectomy and inguinal lymph node dissection. The tumor was staged as T4N1M0, according to the European Association of Urologyâ€™s tumor-node-metastasis classification system. The patient was treated with pelvic radiotherapy and six cycles of systemic neoadjuvant chemotherapy with cisplatin and paclitaxel simultaneously, over a period of four months. After nine months of follow-up the patient succumbed to the disease due to widespread metastases.
