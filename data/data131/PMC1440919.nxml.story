Many proteins are chemically modified after they are synthesized in the cell. These post-translational modifications can modulate the ability of a protein to perform chemical reactions and to interact with other proteins. At the cellular level, for example, these chemical modifications are critical for allowing the cell to respond to its environment and control its division. One of the most common mechanisms by which proteins can be modified is by phosphorylationâ€”the addition of a phosphate group to an amino acid side chain of the protein. Thousands of proteins are known to be modified by phosphorylation, but only for a small minority of these do we have any detailed understanding of how the chemical modification regulates the function of the protein. The authors describe a computational method that can make testable predictions about the structural changes that occur in a protein induced by post-translational phosphorylation. Their results show that the method can produce structural models of the phosphorylated proteins with near-atomic accuracy, and provide insight into the energetics of conformational switches driven by phosphorylation. As such, the computational method complements experiments aimed at understanding the mechanisms of protein regulation by phosphorylation.
