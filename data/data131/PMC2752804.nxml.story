A deleterious lesion in DNA is a break of both strands, or a chromosome double-strand break (DSB). DSBs can arise during normal cellular metabolism, but are also a consequence of many forms of cancer therapy. If DSBs are not repaired prior to cell division, entire segments of a chromosome can be lost. Several pathways ensure that DSBs are repaired, though some pathways are prone to causing mutations and/or chromosomal rearrangements, each of which can contribute to cancer development. In the first part of this study, we describe the roles of individual genetic factors in distinct repair pathways of DSBs generated by the I-SceI endonuclease. From these studies, we find that some factors can function in multiple repair pathways. In the second part of this study, we present a method for partially degrading the cohesive DSB overhangs that are generated by I-SceI, which we find facilitates repair products that are not prone to being re-cut by the endonuclease. As a consequence, we have limited the persistence of such breaks, which we find causes a reduction in repair pathways that lead to significant genetic loss. As well, we use this method to characterize the role of individual genetic factors during the repair of non-cohesive DSB ends.
