The simple manipulation of dietary restriction (DR) (reduction of caloric intake by about 30% in rodents) produces robust increases in lifespan and slows the development of almost all age-related diseases, including cancer and neurological diseases. This relationship between dietary restriction and longevity is observed in most models in which the effect of DR has been tested. Thus, understanding how DR produces its protective mechanisms would have potentially profound implications for the treatment of age-related diseases, including possibly the development of a “magic bullet” for these diseases. In the present study we have discovered that DR induces a transcription factor, CBP, and additional factors that work with CBP to control the expression of other genes involved in determination of lifespan. When we blocked the DR-mediated increase in CBP and associated factors, we blocked all the protective effects of DR on lifespan extension, on the slowed rate of aging, and on protection against pathology in a model of Alzheimer's disease. Further, in mice expression of CBP and a CBP-interacting factor positively predicted lifespan, and expression of both factors decreased with age and in diabetes. Finally, pharmacological manipulations that mimicked enhanced CBP activity increased lifespan and reduced pathology in a model of Alzheimer's disease.
