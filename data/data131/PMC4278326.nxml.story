Metastatic progression of malignant tumors resistant to conventional therapeutic approaches is an ultimate challenge in clinical oncology. Despite the efforts of basic and clinical researchers, there is still no effective treatment schedule to prevent or combat metastatic spread of malignant tumors. This report presents recent findings that could help in the development of targeted therapeutics directed against the most aggressive and treatment-resistant carcinoma cells. It was demonstrated that HNSCC carcinoma cell lines with acquired treatment resistance possessed increased number of cells with carcinoma stem cell (CSC) properties. Furthermore, resistant cells were characterized by increased expression of Rac1, enhanced cell migration, and accelerated release of proangio- and vasculogenic factors (VEGF-A) and influence on endothelial cell (HMEC-1) migration. Inhibition of Rac1 signaling in the treatment-resistant carcinoma cells can interrupt metastatic process due to anoikis restoration and decrease of cell migration. It is also suggested that carcinoma cells with repressed survival capacities will be characterized by reduced release of proangiogenic factors, resulting in the decrease of endothelial cell migration. Therefore targeting of Rac1-related pathways may be considered as a promising therapeutic approach to prevent or combat metastatic lesions.
