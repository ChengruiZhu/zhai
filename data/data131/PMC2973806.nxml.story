Enzymes are responsible for several critical cellular functions. The so-called catalytic residues are fundamental to attain the enzyme function. Those residues are often highly conserved within protein families sharing similar structure and function. Characterization of catalytic residues is essential for the understanding of enzyme function. However, this is a difficult task because conservation is a poor discriminator of catalytic residues due to the fact that many non-catalytic residues are highly conserved in a given protein family. We anticipate that variations in the structural environment of a catalytic site should be highly restrained in order for the protein to maintain its function along the course of evolution, and hypothesise that catalytic residues, due to these restrains, must carry a particular signature defined by networks of proximity sharing high mutual information (MI). We validated this hypothesis on a large data set of protein sequences with known catalytic residues, and demonstrated that catalytic sites are indeed surrounded by networks of coevolved residues. Such networks should also be present in other classes of proteins and we suggest that MI networks could be a novel feature of general importance beneficial for the prediction of functional residues.
