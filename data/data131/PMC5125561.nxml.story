Taste papillae are small organs visible on the surface of the tongue that contain taste buds, which are connected to nerves that transmit signals for taste sensation to the brain. To function properly, taste papilla and taste bud cells need to be continuously replenished. We are studying how collections of proteins, called signaling pathways, ensure that the sense of taste is maintained. We show that one specific signaling pathway, the Hedgehog pathway, is absolutely essential for proper function of taste organs. When we block the Hedgehog pathway, nearly all taste papillae dramatically change shape and taste buds disappear. This response occurs because specific taste cell populations in the taste papillae can no longer function properly, even though taste organ nerves are still present. When we release the blockade of Hedgehog signaling, many taste papillae and taste buds are regenerated. Our findings identify a critical requirement for the Hedgehog signaling pathway in maintaining taste papillae and taste buds, help explain why cancer patients treated with Hedgehog pathway inhibitors lose their ability to taste, and suggest that changes in this pathway could be responsible for other conditions associated with taste disturbance.
