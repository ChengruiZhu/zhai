 and investigated the role of the NLRP3 inflammasome in this model. Mice were classified as non-inoculated group (group A) and inoculated groups (groups B, C, D and E, sacrificed 1, 3, 7 and 14 days after inoculation, respectively). Hematoxylin-eosin staining showed that each group had inflammatory cell infiltration, except group A. The damage of the nasal mucosa was aggravated gradually over time. Western blot and immunofluorescence showed that the structural proteins of the NLRP3 inflammasome (NLRP3, ASC (apoptosis-associated speck-like protein containing CARD), procaspase-1) in groups B, C, D and E were increased gradually. But they were reduced in group B compared with group A, except for NLRP3. Western blot showed that the cleavage fragment of procaspase-1, p20 in groups B, C, D and E was increased gradually. Real-time PCR showed that the corresponding mRNAs of the structural proteins were changed the same as their proteins. IL-1β mRNA and mature IL-1β protein were increased gradually in groups A, B, C, D and E. These results indicate that NLRP3 inflammasome activation was associated with the acute rhinosinusitis, and that there was a positive correlation between the expression level of the NLRP3 inflammasome and the severity of acute rhinosinusitis.
