Correction osteotomies of the first metatarsal are common surgical approaches in treating hallux valgus deformities whereas the Scarf osteotomy has gained popularity. The purpose of this study was to analyze short- and mid-term results in hallux valgus patients who underwent a Scarf osteotomy. The subjective and radiological outcome of 131 Scarf osteotomies (106 hallux valgus patients, mean age: 57.5 years, range: 22–90 years) were retrospectively analyzed. Mean follow-up was 22.4 months (range: 6 months–5 years). Surgical indications were: intermetatarsal angle (IMA) of 12–23°; increased proximal articular angle (PAA>8°), and range of motion of the metatarsophalangeal joint in flexion and extension >40°. Exclusion criteria were severe osteoporosis and/or osteoarthritis. The mean subjective range of motion (ROM) of the great toe post-surgery was 0.8±1.73 points (0: full ROM, 10: total stiffness). The mean subjective cosmetic result was 2.7±2.7 points (0: excellent, 10: poor). The overall post-operative patient satisfaction with the result was high (2.1±2.5 points (0: excellent, 10: poor). The mean hallux valgus angle improvement was 16.6° (pre-operative mean value: 37.5°) which was statistically significant (
