The aim of the present study was to identify differential pathways in uterine leiomyomata (UL) using a novel method based on protein-protein interaction networks and pathway analysis. The pathway networks were constructed by examining the intersections of the Reactome database and the Search Tool for the Retrieval of Interacting Genes/proteins (STRING) protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks. The Objective network was defined as the differential expressed genes (DEGs) associated with the interactions identified by STRING. Topological centrality (degree) analysis was performed for the Objective network to explore the hub genes and hub networks. Subsequent to isolating the intersections between the Pathway and Objective networks, randomization tests were conducted to identify the differential pathways. There were 559,598 interactions in the Pathway networks. A total of 657 genes with 3,835 interactions were mapped in the Objective network, which included 20 hub genes. It was identified that 358 pathways demonstrated interaction with the Objective network, such as Signal Transduction, Immune System and Signaling by G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR). By accessing the randomization tests, P-values of these pathways were close to 0, which indicated that they were significantly different. The present study successfully identified differential pathways (such as signal transduction, immune system and signaling by GPCR) in UL, which may be potential biomarkers in the detection and treatment of UL.
