Stem cell differentiation and the maintenance of self-renewal are intrinsically complex processes that require coordinated regulation on many different cellular levels. Here we focus on the relationship between two important layers and follow it over the first five days of differentiation. The first layer – measured by acetylation of one of the histone proteins – describes which parts of the DNA are tightly wrapped up and which lie open. The second layer describes the activity of genes measured by their mRNA expression. Using a wide array of statistical approaches we show that changes in histone acetylation are very predictive for gene expression and that the concordance between the two levels increases over time. Concentrating on genes central to the regulatory networks in embryonic stem cells we find that key genes show very high acetylation signal in the beginning that decreases quickly over time, indicating that they lie in initially open regions that are rapidly closing down. These results are a step forward to a better understanding of the complexities of the relationship between histone acetylation and gene expression, which will help to dissect the multilayer regulatory mechanisms that determine stem cell fate.
