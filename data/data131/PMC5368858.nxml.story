To discuss the feasibility and safety of prophylactic tentorium cerebelli hiatus incision in surgery of glioma located in lateral fissure area. There were 80 patients with glioma located in lateral fissure area who received treatment from May 2012 to May 2015, divided into two groups, the research group (n=40) and control group (n=40), and then statistical analysis was carried out. Difference in total resection rate and subtotal resection rate of glioma between patients of the research group and those of the control group was not significant (P>0.05); intracranial pressure of patients in the research group was significantly lower than that of control group (P<0.05), their hospital stay was significantly shorter than that of the control group (P<0.05), times of using mannitol were significantly fewer than control group (P<0.05), but the differences of acute renal function damage and second surgery occurrence rate between patients of the two groups were not significant (P>0.05). Prophylactic tentorium cerebelli hiatus incision in surgery of glioma located in lateral fissure area can effectively reduce patients’ intracranial pressure, shorten patients’ hospital stay and reduce patients’ times of using mannitol without increasing the rate of patients’ acute renal function damage and second surgery.
