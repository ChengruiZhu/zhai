Axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) or sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) alone may lead to postoperative complications. Among patients with positive ALN in the preoperative examination, approximately 40% patients do not have SLN metastasis. Herein, we aimed to develop a model to predict the probability of ALN metastasis as a preoperative tool to support clinical decision-making. We retrospectively analyzed the clinicopathological features of 4211 female patients with breast cancer who were diagnosed in seven breast cancer centers representing entire China, over 10 years (1999-2008). The patients were randomly categorized into a training cohort or validation cohort (3:1 ratio). Multivariate logistic regression analysis was performed for 1869 patients with complete information on the study variables. Age at diagnosis, tumor size, tumor quadrant, clinical nodal status, local invasion status, pathological type, and molecular subtypes were the independent predictors of ALN metastasis. The nomogram was then developed using the seven variables. Further, it was subsequently validated in 642 patients with complete data on variables in the validation cohort. Coefficient of determination (R
