Proper fluid management is crucial for the management of critically ill patients. However, there is a continuing debate about the choice of the fluid, i.e., crystalloid vs. colloid. Colloid solution is theoretically advantageous to the crystalloid because of larger volume effect and less interstitial fluid accumulation, and hydroxyethyl starch (HES) is most frequently used for perioperative setting. Nevertheless, application of HES solution is relatively limited due to its side effects including renal toxicity and coagulopathy. Since prolonged presence of large HES molecule is responsible for these side effects, rapidly degradable HES solution with low degree of substitution (tetrastarch) supposedly has less potential for negative effects. Thus, tetrastarch may be more frequently used in the ICU setting. However, several large-scale randomized trials reported that administration of tetrastarch solution to the patients with severe sepsis has negative effects on mortality and renal function. These results triggered further debate and regulatory responses around the world. This narrative review intended to describe the currently available evidence about the advantages and disadvantages of tetrastarch in the ICU setting.
