The knowledge of protein functions is central for understanding life at a molecular level and has huge biochemical and pharmaceutical implications. However, despite best research efforts, a substantial and ever-increasing number of proteins predicted by genome sequencing projects still lack functional annotations. Computational methods are required to determine protein functions quickly and reliably since experimental investigation is difficult and costly. Considering literature shows combining various types of information is crucial for functionally annotating proteins, such methods must be able to integrate data from different sources which may be scattered, non-standardized, incomplete, and noisy. Many protein families are composed of proteins with different folds and functions. In such cases, the division into subtypes which share specific functions uncommon to the family as a whole may lead to important information about the function and structure of a related protein of unknown function, as well as about the functional diversification acquired by the family during evolution. This workâ€™s purpose is to automatically detect isofunctional subfamilies in a protein family of unknown function, as well as identify residues responsible for differentiation. We integrate data and then provide it to a clustering algorithm, which creates clusters of similar proteins we found correspond to same-specificity subfamilies.
