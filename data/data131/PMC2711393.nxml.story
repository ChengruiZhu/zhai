Unilateral small kidney with ureteral obstruction was discovered in a 74-year-old female cadaver during an anatomical dissection course. In order to elucidate the histogenesis of renal dysplasia, we carried out histochemical and immunohistochemical analyses. On macroscopic view, the kidney was approximately 3 cm in length, 2 cm in width and weighed only 9 g. Although the ureter ran from the renal hilus to the bladder, its width was under 2 mm. The renal parenchyma was extremely thin and there was a large congested vein in the renal sinus. On microscopic examination of the kidney, we observed that numerous developing renal tubules had cytokeratin-positive epithelia, most of which were surrounded by concentric fibrosis. However, we could not detect any structures resembling the collecting duct, renal tubules, renal pelvis, or glomeruli. The concentric mesencymal fibrous tissue surrounding the immature renal tubules contained the smooth muscles that were positive for h-caldesmon. Serial sections of the ureter revealed several small and discontinuous lacunae lined by cuboidal and transitional epithelium, which did not constitute a patent lumen through the bladder. This case is a rare case of renal dysplasia with defect in recanalization of the ureteral bud during the early developmental stage.
