Transcription factor 7-like 2 has been shown to be associated with type 2 diabetes mellitus in multiple ethnic groups in recent years. In the Chinese Han population in particular, numerous studies have evaluated the association between the rs11196218A/G polymorphism of the transcription factor 7-like 2 gene and type 2 diabetes mellitus. However, the results have been inconsistent, so we performed a meta-analysis to assess the association. Odds ratio and 95% confidence interval values were calculated using a random-effects model or a fixed-effects model based on heterogeneity analysis. The quality of the included studies was evaluated using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale. Subgroup analyses were conducted based on conformity with Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium in the control group as well as on other variables, such as age, sex and body mass index. Sensitivity analysis was also performed to detect heterogeneity and to assess the stability of the results. In total, 10 case-control studies comprising 7,491 cases and 12,968 controls were included in this meta-analysis. The combined analysis indicated that the rs11196218A/G polymorphism was not associated with type 2 diabetes mellitus (G vs. A,
