Fall related injuries in nursing homes have a major impact on the quality of life in later adulthood and there is a dearth of studies on falling and fall prevention from the older person's perspective. The aim of the study was to identify how older persons perceive falling, fall prevention, and fall accidents. Six in-depth interviews were carried out and a hermeneutic phenomenological method was used to describe and interpret the older persons’ accounts. Interpretations of Levinasian and Heidegarian philosophy related to dwelling and mobility helped cultivate important insights. Symbolic and physical environments are important for the participants’ well-being. The older persons in the study did not wish to dwell on the subject of falling and spoke of past and present coping strategies and the importance of staying on their feet. The women spoke about endurance in their daily lives. The men's narrations were more dramatic; they became animated when they spoke of their active past lives. As the scope of the study is small, these gender differences require further investigation. However, their stories give specific knowledge about the individual and their symbolic environmental circumstances and universal knowledge about the importance of integrating cultural environmental knowledge in health promotion and care work. Traditional fall prevention interventions are often risk oriented and based on generalized knowledge applied to particular cases. The findings indicate a need for contextual life-world knowledge and an understanding of fall prevention as a piece in a larger puzzle within a broader framework of culture, health, and well-being. Showing an interest in the older persons’ stories can help safeguard their integrity and promote their well-being. This can ignite a spark that kindles their desire to participate in meaningful exercises and activities.
