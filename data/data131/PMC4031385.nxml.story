MicroRNAs comprise a large family of short, non-coding RNAs that are present in most eukaryotic organisms and are typically involved in downregulating the expression of protein-coding genes. The detailed mechanisms of miRNA functioning in animals and plants have been under investigation for more than decade. In mammalian cells, miRNA guides the effector complex miRISC to bind with partially complementary sequences, usually within the 3â€²UTR of mRNAs, and inhibit protein synthesis with or without transcript degradation. In addition to these main mechanisms, several other modes of miRNA-mediated gene expression regulation have been described, but their scale and importance remain a matter of debate. In this review, we briefly summarize the pathway of miRNA precursor processing during miRNA biogenesis and continue with the description of the miRISC assembly process. Then, we present the miRNA-mediated mechanisms of gene expression regulation in detail, and we gather information concerning the proteins involved in these processes. In addition, we briefly refer to the current applications of miRNA mechanisms in therapeutic strategies. Finally, we highlight some of the remaining controversies surrounding the regulation of mammalian gene expression by miRNAs.
