The present study was an attempt to develop galactosylated albumin nanoparticles of Simvastatin for treatment of hypercholesterolemia. By developing the galactosylated nanoparticulated delivery, the required action of the drug at the target site at the liver can be provided. The advantage of targeting helps to reduce the systemic side effects that may occur due to the distribution of the drug to the other organs and thus helps in maintaining the required concentration of drug at the desired site. The galacotsylated albumin nanoparticles were prepared for the selective delivery of a Simvastatin to the 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase (HMG-CoA reductase) the rate-limiting enzyme in the pathway of cholesterol biosynthesis that is particularly presents on hepatocytes. The asialoglycoprotein receptor (ASGP-R) which is particularly presents on mammalian hepatocytes can be utilize for active targeting by using its natural and synthetic ligands. By utilizing this receptors can provides a unique means for the development of liver-specific carriers, such as liposomes, recombinant lipoproteins, and polymers for drug or gene delivery to the liver, especially to hepatocytes. These receptors recognize the ligands with terminal galactose or N-acetylgalactosamine residues, and endocytose the ligands for an intracellular degradation process.
