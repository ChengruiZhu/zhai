We report a case of myopic choroidal neovascularization that showed improvement after a single injection of ranibizumab. A 45-year-old Chinese man with high myopia presented with sudden onset painless central scotoma of his right eye of 2 weeksâ€™ duration. There was no history of trauma. His right eye vision on presentation was 6/30 which showed no improvement with pinhole. The right fundus showed myopic maculopathy at the posterior pole with subretinal hemorrhage at the inferotemporal fovea. The optic disc was tilted with inferotemporal peripapillary atrophy. There was a myopic maculopathy appearance in the macula of the left eye. Fundus fluorescein angiography revealed choroidal neovascularization at the fovea of the right eye. A diagnosis of right eye choroidal neovascularization secondary to myopic maculopathy was made. A single intravitreal injection of ranibizumab 0.05 mL was given. Ten weeks following intravitreal injection, vision had improved to 6/7.5, and repeated fundus fluorescein angiography showed absence of choroidal neovascularization. Follow-up at 6 months showed visual acuity had normalized to 6/6 with glasses, which was maintained up to 12 months following treatment. The right fundus showed no further subretinal hemorrhage with no new lesions.
