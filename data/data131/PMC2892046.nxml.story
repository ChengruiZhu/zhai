Korean allergology has made great progress in keeping pace with global scientific advances in spite of a short history. Outstanding academic and scientific researches have been performed in a variety of allergy fields in Korea. Epidemiologic studies revealed increasing prevalence of asthma and allergic diseases and considerable morbidity and mortality in Korea. Novel inhalant allergens such as citrus red mite and two-spotted spider mite as causes of asthma and allergic rhinitis have been discovered and reported in Korea. Bidirectional translational researches have been performed and are underway to elucidate the pathogenesis of asthma and allergy, mechanisms of airway inflammation and remodeling, and new therapeutic modalities for asthma and allergic diseases. Experimental asthma models of different phenotypes according to exposed levels of lipopolysaccharide or double-stranded RNA suggested the crucial role of the innate immunity in the development of allergic airway inflammation and a new insight for asthma pathogenesis, in which both Th1 and Th2 inflammation are involved. In the field of genetic researches, numerous genetic associations with asthma and asthma-related phenotypes, such as atopy, IgE production, and airway hyperresponsiveness, have been demonstrated in Korean population. The Easy Asthma Management (EAM) program, a computer-assisted asthma management program, is anticipated to facilitate the achievement of more successful clinical outcomes by filling the gaps between guidelines and actual practices. The Integration of these multi-disciplinary allergy research resources and translation of scientific achievements to the bedside and society will lead to better allergy and asthma control in Korea.
