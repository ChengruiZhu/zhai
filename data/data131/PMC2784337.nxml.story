during 2008 addressed traumatic brain injury (TBI), burns, diagnostic concerns and immunosuppression. In regard to TBI, preliminary results indicate the utility of either magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or ultrasound in measuring optic nerve sheath diameter to identify elevated intracranial pressure (ICP) as well as the potential benefit of thiopental for refractory ICP. Another investigaticc7960on demonstrated that early extubation of TBI patients whose Glasgow Coma Scale score was 8 or less did not result in additional incidence of nosocomial pneumonia. Another study indicated that strict glucose control resulted in worse outcomes during the first week after TBI, but improved outcomes after the second week. Another paper showed the prolonged neuroprotective advantages of proges-terone administration in TBI patients. There was also guidance on improved classifications of renal complications in burn patients. Another study found that patients with inhalation injuries and increased interleukin-6 (IL-6) and IL-10 and decreased IL-7 had increased mortality rates. One literature review described the disadvantages of prolonged immobilization or additional use of MRI for ruling out cervical spine injuries in obtunded TBI patients already cleared by computerized tomography scans. Other investigators found that higher N-terminal pro B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) levels may be useful markers for post-traumatic cardiac impairment. Finally, an experimental model showed that both splenic apoptosis and lymphocytopenia may occur shortly after severe hemorrhage, thus increasing the threat of immunosuppression in those with severe blood loss.
