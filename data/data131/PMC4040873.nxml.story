Andersen - Tawil syndrome (ATS) is an autosomal - dominant or sporadic disorder characterized by ventricular arrhythmias, periodic paralysis, and distinctive facial and skeletal dysmorphism. Mutations in KCNJ2, which encodes the Î±-subunit of the potassium channel Kir2.1, were identified in patients with ATS. This genotype has been designated as type-1 ATS (ATS1). KCNJ2 mutations are detectable in up to 60 % of patients with ATS. Cardiac manifestations of ATS include frequent premature ventricular contractions (PVC), Q-U interval prolongation, prominent U-waves, and a special type of polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (PMVT) called bidirectional ventricular tachycardia (BiVT). The presence of frequent PVCs at rest are helpful in distinguishing ATS from typical catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (CPVT). In typical CPVT, rapid PMVT and BiVT usually manifest during or after exercising. Additionally, CPVT or torsade de pointes in LQTS are faster, very symptomatic causing syncope or often deteriorate into VF resulting in sudden cardiac death. PVCs at rest are quite frequent in ATS1 patients, however, in LQTS patients, PVCs and asymptomatic VT are uncommon which also contributes to differentiating them.
