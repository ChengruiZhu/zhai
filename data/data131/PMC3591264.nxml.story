The most fundamental and popular gene-expression experiments measure genome-wide transcription levels in two populations: perturbed and wild type, or cases and controls. The genes that show significantly different expression between the two populations (the differentially expressed genes) are useful for understanding the biology underlying the phenotype difference, and can sometimes also serve as biomarkers for classification. In contrast, genes that have similar expression to each other across all profiles (co-expressed genes) can yield clues about the functional commonality of the two populations. Differential co-expression has recently been proposed as a way to combine the benefits of these two approaches: it seeks gene groups that are co-expressed in one phenotype much more than in the other. Here we develop a new method for detecting differential co-expression and test it on case-control expression profiles of several diseases. Our algorithm improves upon the state of the art in the strength of the detected patterns and in agreement with current biological knowledge. We show that our method can predict gene regulators that are associated with the disease of interest and demonstrate that it can dissect known biological pathways into subcomponents that are not detected using standard analyses.
