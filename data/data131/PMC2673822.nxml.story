Increasing attention is being paid on synthetic DNA delivery systems considering some potential life-threatening effects of viral particles, for development of gene-based nano-medicine in the 21st century. In the current nonviral approaches, most of the efforts have been engaged with organic macromolecules like lipids, polymers, and peptides, but comparatively fewer attempts were made to evaluate the potential of inorganic materials for gene delivery. We recently reported that biodegradable nanoparticles of carbonate apatite are highly efficient in transfecting a wide variety of mammalian cells. Here we show that a number of parameters actively regulate synthesis of the nanoparticles and their subsequent transfection efficacy. Development of “supersaturation”, which is the prerequisite for generation of such particles, could be easily modulated by reactant concentrations, pH of the buffered solution, and incubation temperatures, enabling us to establish a flexible particle generation process for highly productive trans-gene delivery. Carbonate incorporation into the particles have been proposed for generating nano-size particles resulting in cellular uptake of huge amount of plasmid DNA as well as endosome destabilization facilitating significant release of DNA from the endosomes.
