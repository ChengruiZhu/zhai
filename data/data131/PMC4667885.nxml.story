Metabolic diseases are to a great extent because of disturbances in hormone secretion. Endocrine cells releasing hormones with a role in metabolism typically possess a refined molecular system for nutrient sensing, which allows them to respond in an appropriate manner to changes in e.g. glucose levels. The gut is the largest endocrine organ of the human body due to a range of endocrine cells that are strategically located to sense nutrient levels in response to food intake. The intestinal L-cells secrete glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1), peptide YY and other hormones with anti-diabetic and weight-reducing effects, but the stimulus-secretion cascade in L-cells is still only partly understood. Here we dissect glucose sensing underlying GLP-1 secretion using mathematical modeling of electrical activity in primary L-cells and the GLP-1 secreting GLUTag cell line. We cast new light on the differences in glucose-sensing between the two cell types, and we propose that primary L-cells encode the glucose signal as changes in action potential amplitude, whereas GLUTag cells rely mainly on frequency modulation. Our results should be of general interest for understanding glucose-sensing in various cell types.
