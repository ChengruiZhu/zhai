The present study aimed to compare the effects of moderate-intensity continuous and high-intensity interval exercise training (ET) on exercise tolerance, cardiac morphometry and function, hemodynamic, and cardiac autonomic modulation in myocardial infarcted mice. Wild-type mice (WT) were divided into four groups: sedentary WT (S); WT myocardium infarction sedentary (IS); WT myocardium infarction underwent to moderate-intensity continuous ET (MICT), and WT myocardium infarction underwent to high-intensity interval ET (MIIT). After 60 days of descending coronary artery ligation, moderate-intensity continuous ET consisted of running at 60% of maximum, while the high-intensity interval training consisted of eight sprints of 4 min at 80% of maximum and a 4-min recovery at 40% of maximum. Both exercises were performed 1 hr a day, 5 days a week, during 8 weeks. Results demonstrated that IS showed elevated exercise tolerance, as well as decreased hemodynamic and heart function, and autonomic control. On the other hand, both programs of ET were equally effective to increase all parameters, without further differences between the groups. In conclusion, the results of the present study showed that myocardial infarction leads to damage in both investigated strains and the two types of physical exercise attenuated the major impairments provoked by myocardial infarction in exercise tolerance, cardiac structure, cardiac function, hemodynamic and cardiac autonomic modulation.
