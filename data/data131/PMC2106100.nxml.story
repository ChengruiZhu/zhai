 A cell has been isolated from explanted rabbit liver which contains, during all phases of its growth in culture, hundreds of lipid-rich particles with a distinct limiting membrane. The cell grows logarithmically with a generation time of 19 to 20 hours and during mitosis the particles are distributed between the daughter cells. Associated with the particles is the high total lipid content of the rabbit liver cell as compared with a rat liver cell, which contains few, if any, lipid-rich particles. This difference in lipid content between the two cells is due primarily to an increase in the triglyceride fraction, in contradistinction to small differences in the polar lipid and sterol ester fractions. The lipid-rich particles have been isolated and found to contain 90 per cent triglyceride on a dry weight basis. The "genetic" factors responsible for the high concentration of lipid-rich particles and triglycerides in the rabbit liver cell require for their full expression one or more factors which are present in much higher effective concentrations in rabbit serum than in horse serum. The hypothesis is advanced that the lipid-rich particles represent a normal state of the non-structural cell lipid. A procedure is described for the quantitative isolation of the lipid of cultured cells.
