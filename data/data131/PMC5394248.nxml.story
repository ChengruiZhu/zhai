Despite China's being the largest and most rapidly aging country in the world, there have been no longitudinal studies investigating the relationship between retirement and cardiovascular disease risk factors in China. In this study, we assessed the associations between retirement and systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, waist circumference, body mass index, smoking status, and alcohol consumption over a 17-year period both before and after retirement among 1,084 people (41.3% women) who participated in the China Health and Nutrition Survey (1991â€“2011) at least once prior to the year in which they retired and at least once afterward. Piecewise models centered at the year of retirement were applied. Retirement was accompanied by a reduction in diastolic blood pressure, a slowdown in the increase of both systolic blood pressure and waist circumference, and a reduction in the probability of being a heavy alcohol drinker. The association between retirement and blood pressure was stronger for men and for urban dwellers. No significant associations with body mass index or smoking were found. This study suggests that retirement may be beneficial for blood pressure, waist circumference, and alcohol consumption in the Chinese context. Understanding the potential health influence of retirement is essential, given plans to raise the retirement age in China.
