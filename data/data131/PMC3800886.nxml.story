The symptoms of an allergic reaction communicate sensitization to certain antigens in the environment. Initiation of antigen reaction stimulates mast cells to release histamine into the blood which interacts with the cells to produce most of the symptoms of the allergy. Drugs that block only the action of histamine are known as antihistaminic while the drugs preventing mast cells from releasing histamine are considered as anti allergic agents. Ayurveda considers Mandagni (Jadharagni in hypofunctional state) as the root cause of the all diseases which produces Ama (Antigen/Visha). Drugs possessing Deepan, Pachan, and Vishaghna properties may prevent histamine release and allergic reactions. Udardaprashamana, Kandughna, Swasahara group of drugs may prevent acute histaminic reaction. Keeping this concept in view a critical review was made about the herbs mentioned in the classical Ganas and aushadhyogas of compilatory works of medieval India in addition to reported activities during 20th century research works. The study aims to identify herbs with Antihistaminic and Antiallergy activity and to discuss safety and efficacy of herbal anti histaminics over the drugs of modern medicine which may produce certain adverse effects like nausea, drowsiness, nasal burning etc.
