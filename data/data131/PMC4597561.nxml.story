From 2002-2011 there were 8,963 cases reported for treatment of an isolated SLAP lesion, and 1540 cases reported for the treatment of SLAP lesion with concomitant rotator cuff repair. Over the study period, for patients with isolated SLAP lesions the proportion of SLAP repairs decreased from 69.3% to 44.8% (p<0.0001), while the proportion of biceps tenodesis increased from 0.2% to 9.3% (p<0.0001) and the proportion of biceps tenotomy increased from 0.4% to 1.7% (p=0.018). For patients undergoing concomitant rotator cuff repair, similar trends were observed as the proportion of SLAP repairs decreased from 60.2% to 15.3% (p<0.0001), while the proportion of those undergoing biceps tenodesis or tenotomy increased from 1.2% to 20.3% (p<0.0001). There was also a significant difference in the mean age of patients undergoing SLAP repair (37.1 years of age) vs biceps tenodesis (48.7 years of age) vs biceps tenotomy (55.7 years of age) (p <0.0001). Surgeons with a declared subspecialty in Shoulder and Elbow surgery performed biceps tenodesis for 17% of isolated SLAP tears, whereas candidates with a declared subspecialty in Hand and Upper Extremity, Sports Medicine, and General Orthopaedics utilized biceps tenodesis in 2-3% of cases involving isolated SLAP tears (p<0.05).
