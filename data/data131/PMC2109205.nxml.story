, which is in the same range as the estimated concentration of receptor sites at other vertebrate cholinergic junctions. Filamentous projections can sometimes be seen extending from the granules to the overlying basement membrane, and in oblique views a reticular pattern may appear both in these patches and in the basement membrane. The cytoplasmic surface of the specialized membrane is covered with an amorphous and filamentous dense material whose distribution coincides with that of the granules visible in the outer layer and which may be connected to them across the membrane. In unosmicated specimens stained with permanganate and uranyl acetate the specialized regions exhibit the same morphological features but stand out sharply in contrast to adjacent areas of unspecialized membrane which appear only faintly. Such preparations are particularly useful in assessing the extent of the specialized membrane. It is proposed that the granules visible at the outer surface of the end-plate membrane represent acetylcholine receptors and that in amphibians, as in annelids, the receptors at myoneural junctions are concentrated into patches which occupy less than the total postjunctional membrane surface area.
