Atrial fibrillation is an irregular heart rhythm affecting millions of people worldwide. Effective treatment of this cardiac disorder relies upon our detailed knowledge and understanding of the mechanisms that lead to arrhythmia. Recent clinical observations have suggested that alternans, a phenomenon where the shape of the electrical signal in the heart alternates from beat to beat, may play an important role in this process, but the underlying mechanisms remain unknown. In this study, we use computational models to conduct a detailed examination of the causes and contributors to alternans associated with human atrial fibrillation. We find that in atria remodeled by atrial fibrillation, alternans appears near resting heart rates because several aspects of calcium cycling are disrupted in the atrial cells. In particular, the release and uptake of calcium from the cellular storage compartment, the sarcoplasmic reticulum, becomes imbalanced, leading to alternation in calcium signals from beat to beat. These findings provide important insights into the mechanisms of proarrhythmic alternans in human atrial fibrillation which may be used to develop novel therapeutic targets and treatment strategies in the future.
