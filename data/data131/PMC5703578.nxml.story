Common stresses such as high blood pressure or heart attack can lead to heart failure, which afflicts over 25 million people worldwide. These stresses cause cardiomyocytes to grow and remodel, which may initially be beneficial but ultimately worsen heart function. Current heart failure drugs such as beta-blockers counteract biochemical cues prompting cardiomyocyte growth, yet mechanical cues to cardiomyocytes such as stretch are just as important in driving cardiac dysfunction. However, no pharmacological treatments have yet been approved that specifically target mechano-signaling, in part because it is not clear how cardiomyocytes integrate signals from multiple mechano-responsive sensors and pathways into their decision to grow. To address this challenge, we built a systems-level computational model that represents 125 interactions between 94 stretch-responsive signaling molecules. The model correctly predicts 134 of 172 previous independent experimental observations, and identifies the key regulators of stretch-induced cardiomyocyte remodeling. Although cardiomyocytes have many mechano-signaling pathways that function largely independently, we find that cooperation between them is necessary to cause growth and remodeling. We identify mechanisms by which a recently approved heart failure drug pair affects mechano-signaling, and we further predict additional pairs of drug targets that could be used to help reverse heart failure.
