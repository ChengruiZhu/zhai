Working memory, the ability to retain information for a short period of time, is a fundamental cognitive function that shapes behavior. The cellular correlate of working memory is the prolonged spiking (persistent) activity of neurons in the prefrontal cortex. Impairments of prefrontal cortex functionalities and working memory have been associated with a variety of cognitive disorders, such as schizophrenia, the attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, and drug addiction. Hence, understanding how neurons embedded in the local circuitry support and maintain persistent activity is of outmost importance. Our work uses a multi-level integrative approach spanning from the dendritic, to the neuronal and network levels to identify the key biophysical and anatomical mechanisms contributing to persistent activity, leading to a number of high impact findings: it predicts a tradeoff between dendritic regenerative events and the size of a network expressing persistent activity. It also proposes when and how the persistent state can be stabilized, opening new avenues for pharmacological interventions. Finally, it describes decoding mechanisms for upcoming ON/OFF state transitions, furthering our understanding of information processing in the PFC and shedding new light on the emergence of anticipatory behaviors.
