In 17 cases of CP angle tumors (24-43 mm, by MRI) approached suboccipitally, we performed bilateral blink reflexes pre/intra/post surgery. The setup consisted of a Nicolet Endeavor IOM system( VIASYS Healthcare, 2005, USA) with the ability to perform several voltage/current stimulations and recordingsup to 20 Evoked Potentials and Electromyography (EMG) simultaneously. Bilateral blink reflexes were evoked by stimulation of bilateral supraorbital nerves. Stimulating pulses of 0.1 ms duration and 5-20 mA intensity were applied percutaneously at the intervals of 10-20 s. The orbicularis oculi muscle responses were recorded using surface electrodes. Early EMG responses (R1) and later reflex activities (R2) were elicited ipsi/contra laterally (R1/2-i/c). Every five successive trials were superimposed and the lowest latencies were used for comparison. Blink reflexes of each subject considered pathologic if: 1- Loss of R1-i,c to the operation side, latencies are more than 15 ms or side differences are 3 ms or more; 2- Loss of R2-i, latencies are more than 50 ms or side differences are 10 ms or more. 3- Loss of R2-c, latencies are more than 55 ms or side differences are 10 ms or more. Recordings were performed 2-3 days before operaration, intraoperative and 21 days after operation.
