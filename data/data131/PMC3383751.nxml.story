A fundamental feature of a neuron is the morphology of its dendrites, which are the processes that receive and integrate synaptic signals from other neurons. Neurons in the mammalian cortex exhibit two distinct dendritic arbors: apical dendrites, which extend far from the cell body, and basal dendrites, which elaborate locally around the cell body. After development, neurons must actively maintain each of these dendritic arbors to sustain their specific connectivity. Because several neurological and neurodevelopmental disorders are associated with disruptions in dendritic morphology, it is crucial to understand the molecular mechanisms that regulate the process of active maintenance of dendritic arbors. We find that disruption of a particular molecular pathway, the Ras-Epac2 pathway, can result in dramatic simplification of basal, but not apical, dendritic arbors in both cultured neurons and in the intact mouse brain. We show that a mutant form of Epac2, identified in patients with autism, also impairs basal dendrite maintenance and disrupts its interaction with Ras. Our findings suggest that specific molecular pathways can regulate distinct dendritic regions, and that disease-related mutations can inform our understanding of the molecules that regulate important biological processes.
