Some modern treatment‚Äêplanning systems (TPSs) provide for input of wedge factor (WF) tables covering the entire range of square and elongated fields available on the LINAC. Depending on the field size increment chosen and the number of available wedge orientations, one may have to take more than 100 measurements per wedge and photon energy to commission the TPS. To expedite TPS commissioning while maintaining high accuracy, we demonstrate a simple method that requires only a few measurements per wedge, from which the remaining wedge factors can be found through linear interpolation based on field area. For the externally mounted wedges of two common LINACs, we have shown that WFs are proportional to field area and are nearly independent of field elongation and wedge orientation. Wedge factors computed from five to seven measurements comprised of square fields and a single, large rectangular field agreed with direct measurements throughout the entire range of achievable field dimensions within 0.6% at 6 MV and within 1% at 15 MV. Making the same set of measurements and using the equivalent square method to find WFs at other field sizes leads to errors up to 2%. Measuring the WF for a
