Previous studies have shown that activated neutrophils and their myeloperoxidase (MPO)-derived products play a crucial role in the pathogenesis of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID)-related small intestinal injury. The aim of the present study is to identify dihalogenated proteins in the small intestine on indomethacin administration. Intestinal damage was induced by subcutaneous administration of indomethacin (10Â mg/kg) in male Wistar rats, and the severity of the injury was evaluated by measuring the area of visible ulcerative lesions. Tissue-associated MPO activity was measured in the intestinal mucosa as an index of neutrophil infiltration. The dihalogenated proteins were separated by two-dimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (2D-PAGE) using novel monoclonal antibodies against dibromotyrosine (DiBrY), and they were identified by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF) peptide mass fingerprinting and a Mascot database search. Single administration of indomethacin elicited increased ulcerative area and MPO activity in the small intestine. 2D-PAGE showed an increased level of DiBrY-modified proteins in the indomethacin-induced injured intestinal mucosa and 6 modified proteins were found. Enolase-1 and albumin were found to be DiBrY modified. These proteins may be responsible for the development of neutrophil-associated intestinal injury induced by indomethacin.
