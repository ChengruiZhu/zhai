Glucocorticoids (GCs) are common components of many chemotherapeutic regimens for lymphoid malignancies including acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). The BCL-2 family has an essential role in regulating GC-induced cell death. Here we show that downregulation of antiapoptotic BCL-2 family proteins, especially MCL-1, enhances GC-induced cell death. Thus we target MCL-1 by using GX15-070 (obatoclax) in ALL cells. Treatment with GX15-070 in both dexamethasone (Dex)-sensitive and -resistant ALL cells shows effective growth inhibition and cell death. GX15-070 induces caspase-3 cleavage and increases the Annexin V-positive population, which is indicative of apoptosis. Before the onset of apoptosis, GX15-070 induces LC3 conversion as well as p62 degradation, both of which are autophagic cell death markers. A pro-apoptotic molecule BAK is released from the BAK/MCL-1 complex following GX15-070 treatment. Consistently, downregulation of BAK reduces caspase-3 cleavage and cell death, but does not alter LC3 conversion. In contrast, downregulation of ATG5, an autophagy regulator, decreases LC3 conversion and cell death, but does not alter caspase-3 cleavage, suggesting that apoptosis and autophagy induced by GX15-070 are independently regulated. Downregulation of Beclin-1, which is capable of crosstalk between apoptosis and autophagy, affects GX15-070-induced cell death through apoptosis but not autophagy. Taken together, GX15-070 treatment in ALL could be an alternative regimen to overcome glucocorticoid resistance by inducing BAK-dependent apoptosis and ATG5-dependent autophagy.
