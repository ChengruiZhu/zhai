The effects of probiotics on horses are still controversial. The present study was a randomized, double-blinded,
placebo-controlled crossover study designed to evaluate the ability of probiotics to improve intestinal conditions in adult
horses. Fermented probiotics were administered to 10 healthy adult geldings for 28 days. The clinical condition of the horses was
monitored daily, and the blood and feces were biochemically analyzed every 14 days. In the probiotic-treated group, the
concentration of carboxylic acids in the feces was increased at days 14 and 28. In contrast to the fecal pH in the control group,
which increased at days 14 and 28, the fecal pH in the probiotic-treated group did not increase. Additionally, the relative
amounts of enteropathogenic bacterial DNA were diminished in the probiotic-treated group. These results suggest that probiotic
bacteria proliferated in the equine intestine. No instances of abnormal clinical conditions or abnormal values in blood tests were
observed throughout the study. Oral administration of fermented probiotics may have the ability to improve the intestinal
environment biochemically and microbiologically without the risk of adverse effects.
