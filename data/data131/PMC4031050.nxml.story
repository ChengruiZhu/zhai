Membrane proteins perform crucial cellular functions and can be involved in serious diseases but remain difficult to study experimentally. Hence, high-resolution membrane protein structures are scarce which hinders the design of selective therapeutics and of receptors with novel function for systems/synthetic biology applications. The computational modeling of membrane protein structures represents an important alternative approach but, to achieve high accuracy, usually requires structural information from closely related proteins currently unavailable for most membrane proteins. To address this limitation, we have developed a novel method to predict membrane protein structures from the structures of non-closely related proteins that differ both in loop and transmembrane regions. Using this approach, we show that a large diversity of membrane proteins can be reconstructed at a level of accuracy suitable for computer-based protein engineering applications. Because requiring information from a single distant homolog only, we expect that around 60% of human membrane proteins can reliably be modeled using our approach, thereby allowing precise structure/function studies on a large fraction of structurally uncharacterized membrane proteins.
