Colorectal cancer (CRC) is one of most malignant tumors, mainly due to its high rate of metastasis and recurrence. The prognosis of CRC is difficult due to early CRC patients have no specific symptoms. Therefore, it is emergent to identify a biomarker for CRC prognosis. Cystatin SN (CST1) shows elevated expression in many tumors, but its role in CRCs is still unknown. Through immunohistochemistry analysis, we found that CST1 was upregulated in CRC samples. The survival analysis had demonstrated that high CST1 expression was closely associated with poor clinical status, providing that CST1 plays a role in CRC tumorigenesis. Furthermore, nomograms were generated using CST1 levels and other factors to evaluate survival of CRCs. We evaluated the reliabilities of these nomograms using an independent cohort of 141 CRC cases and found that high CST1 expression is linked to low survival, which is consistent with the clinical results. Thus, we could predict the survival of a CRC patient via these nomograms. In addition, the multivariate analysis identified CST1 as an independent prognostic factor for CRCs, providing CST1 as a biomarker for CRC prognosis. Taken together, our studies revealed a close relationship between CST1 and CRCs, suggesting that CST1 possibly acts as a marker for CRC prognosis and a target for CRC therapy.
