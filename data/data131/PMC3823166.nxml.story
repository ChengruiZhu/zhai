MicroRNA (miRNA)s are a class of non-coding RNAs that regulate gene expression post-transcriptionally. Muscle-specific miRNA, miRNA (miR)-1, miR-133 and miR-206 play a crucial role in the regulation of muscle development and homeostasis. Muscle injuries are a common muscloskeletal disorder, and the most effective treatment has not been established yet. The purpose of this study was to demonstrate that a local injection of double-stranded (ds) miR-1, miR-133 and 206 can accelerate muscle regeneration in a rat skeletal muscle injury model. After the laceration of the rat tibialis anterior muscle, ds miR-1, 133 and 206 mixture mediated atelocollagen was injected into the injured site. The control group was injected with control siRNA. At 1 week after injury, an injection of miRNAs could enhance muscle regeneration morphologically and physiologically, and prevent fibrosis effectively compared to the control siRNA. Administration of exogenous miR-1, 133 and 206 can induce expression of myogenic markers, MyoD1, myogenin and Pax7 in mRNA and expression in the protein level at 3 and 7 days after injury. The combination of miR-1, 133 and 206 can promote myotube differentiation, and the expression of MyoD1, myogenin and Pax7 were up-regulated in C2C12 cells
