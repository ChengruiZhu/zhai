We explored the role of TNFR/TNF-α signalingin apoptosis among alveolar macrophages (AM) and its relevance to the development of coal workers’ pneumoconiosis (CWP). Purified alveolar macrophages (AMs) were prepared from bronchoalveolar lavage fluid harvested from 366 CWP patients and 120 healthy subjects enrolled inthe study. The purified AMs were then divided into control, SOD, anti-TNFR, TNFR and NFkB inhibitor groups and analyzed for apoptosis usingflow cytometry (sub-diploid peak) and western blotting (Bcl-2, Caspase-3 and Caspase-8 expression). We found thatAM apoptosis washigher amongCWP patients than thehealthycontrols. Expression ofBcl-2, Caspase-3 and Caspase-8 was higher inAMs from CWP patientsthan in those from the controlsand correlated with increased AM apoptosis. Univariate and multivariate analyses suggested that CWP grade, initial exposure time, exposure time inyears, and CWP onset agewereall associated with altered levels of Bcl-2, Caspase-3 and Caspase-8. Inhibition of TNFR/TNF-α signaling usinganti-TNFR antibody, SOD or NFkB inhibitionreduced AM apoptosisand decreased Bcl-2, Caspase-3 and Caspase-8 expression. These data suggestinhibition of a TNFR/TNF-α signaling pathway is a potentiallyeffective means ofalleviating CWP by inhibiting AM apoptosis.
