A total of 3,090 athletes d the survey (503 HS, 856 collegiate, and 1,731 professional athletes). 46.3% of HS athletes, 67.7% of collegiate athletes, and 45.9% of professional athletes specialized to play a single sport during their childhood/adolescence (p< 0.00001). Single sport specialization in these groups occurred at a younger age in the HS athletes (12.7 ± 2.4 years old), compared to the college (14.8 ± 2.5 years old) and professional athletes (14.06 ± 2.8 years old) (p<0.001). At the age of specialization, collegiate athletes spent more months per year training for their sport (10.03 ± 2.64 months), compared to HS (8.5 ± 3.4 months) and professional athletes (8.3 ± 3.5 months) (p<0.0001). A lower percentage of professional athletes believed that specialization helped them to play at a higher level (61.7%) compared to HS (79.7%) and collegiate athletes (80.6%) (p<0.0001). Current HS (39.9%) and collegiate athletes (42.1%) recalled a statistically higher incidence of sport-related injury than current professional athletes (25.4%) (p<0.0001). Notably, only 22.33% of professional athletes said they would want their own child to specialize to play only one sport during childhood/adolescence.
