The Janus kinase 2 mutant V617F occurs with high frequency in myeloproliferative neoplasms. Further mutations affecting the Janus kinase family have been discovered mostly in leukaemias and in myeloproliferative neoplasms. Owing to their involvement in neoplasia, inflammatory diseases and in the immune response, Janus kinases are promising targets for kinase inhibitor therapy in these disease settings. Various quantitative assays including two newly developed screening assays were used to characterize the function of different small-molecule compounds in cells expressing Jak2V617F. A detailed comparative analysis of different Janus kinase inhibitors in our quantitative assays and the subsequent characterization of additional activities demonstrated for the first time that the most potent Jak2 inhibitor in our study, CEP701, also targets Aurora kinases. CEP701 shows a unique combination of both activities which is not found in other compounds also targeting Jak2. Furthermore, colony forming cell assays showed that Janus kinase 2 inhibitors preferentially suppressed the growth of erythroid colonies, whereas inhibitors of Aurora kinases preferentially blocked myeloid colony growth. CEP701 demonstrated a combined suppression of both colony types. Moreover, we show that combined application of a Janus and an Aurora kinase inhibitor recapitulated the effect observed for CEP701 but might allow for more flexibility in combining both activities in clinical settings,
