To travel between the cytoplasm and nucleus, proteins rely on a family of transport proteins known as the karyopherinβ family. Karyopherinβ2, the human version of a family member, recognizes cargo proteins containing a class of nuclear localization signal known as the PY-NLS. The yeast homolog of Karyopherinβ2, Kap104p, also recognizes PY-NLSs, indicating that this pathway has been conserved between evolutionarily distant species. We mutated residues in the PY-NLSs of two Kap104p cargo proteins and analyzed how tightly these mutants bound Kap104p. These experiments revealed three PY-NLS regions, or epitopes, that are important for binding Kap104p. Each epitope is composed of amino acids that vary between cargoes. The epitopes are energetically independent and bind Kap104p with varying strengths in different PY-NLSs, such that mutating the epitope of one PY-NLS may mistakenly direct cargo to the cytoplasm, while a similar mutation in a different PY-NLS has little effect on cargo localization. This flexible, energetically modular, and combinatorial architecture of PY-NLSs may confer higher tolerance to mutations, but it also allows greater sequence diversity, making prediction of new PY-NLSs difficult. The characteristics of PY-NLSs reported here will assist in the identification of new Kap104p cargoes. And the approach used may be applicable to other biological recognition pathways.
