Oral lichen planus (OLP) is a chronic inflammatory mucosal disease of unknown etiology. Many studies have implicated the protective role of antioxidants in such diseases. The aim of this study was to compare salivary total antioxidant capacity (TAC and malondialdehyde (MDA) and antioxidant vitamin (vitamin s A, C and E) levels in patients with erosive OLP and healthy individuals. Thirty six patients with OLP (14 males, 22 females) and 36 control subjects (15 males, 21 females), matched for age and sex were enrolled in this case control study. The salivary levels of MDA, TAC, and antioxidant vitamin levels were measured in both case and control groups. The salivary level of MDA was significantly higher (p<0.001) in patients than in controls. In patients with OLP, the TAC of saliva was significantly lower than that in healthy subjects (p<0.001). Compared with controls, the levels of salivary antioxidant vitamins were significantly decreased in patients with OLP (p<0.001). In addition, a positive correlation was found between the decrease in the salivary amount of vitamin C and that in vitamin E in patients and controls. In addition to the lower salivary levels of antioxidant vitamins and the lower TAC, the higher level of MDA in patients with OLP suggests that free radicals and the resulting oxidative damage may be important in the pathogenesis of OLP lesions.
