, 2012 as the primary and internal validation cohort. Similar patients from a western hospital formed an external validation cohort. The predictive accuracy of the PRETEXT system compared with the currently used staging systems was measured by the area under the curve (AUC) on receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis. Of the 507 patients in the primary cohort, the overall median survival was 52.3 months, and the 1-year, 3-year, and 5-year overall survival rates were 83.0%, 56.8%, and 40.2%, respectively. The multivariate analysis of Cox proportional hazard regression identified INR (p=0.001), microvascular invasion (p=0.042), maximum tumor size (p=0.002) and PRETEXT staging system were independently predictors of overall survival. In the primary cohort, the AUC of the PRETEXT system was 0.702 (95% CI, 0.656 to 0.747), which was higher than the other conventional staging systems for predicting OS of HCC (P<0.01). These findings were confirmed with the internal and external validation cohorts. This study showed that the PRETEXT was a good prognostic staging system for HCC. It performed better than the conventional and commonly used staging systems in predicting survival of patients with HCC after curative partial hepatectomy.
