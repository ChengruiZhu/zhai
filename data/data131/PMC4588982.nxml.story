157 patients (25 female, 132 male; average age 50 years; average postop 4.9 years) were evaluated with L’Insalata, UCLA, and ASES questionnaires, scoring 84.78, 29.77, and 83.4, respectively. In the 33 patients who had an isolated LHBT transfer, the L’Insalata, UCLA, and ASES scores were 79.52, 27.6, and 83.95, respectively. 43 shoulders (7 female, 36 male; average age 50 years; average postop 5.1 years) were available for clinical examination by a physician other than the treating surgeon. There was no statistically significant side-to- side strength difference using a 10-pound weight. All of the patients reported no arm pain at rest with regard to the biceps. 81% of patients reported no biceps tenderness upon palpation of the bicipital groove and 85.8% had a negative throwing test. 95.2% of patients had a negative active compression test. Speed’s and Yergason’s tests were negative in 90.5% and 95.2% of patients respectively. One patient (3%) complained of fatigue discomfort (soreness) isolated to the biceps muscle following resisted elbow flexion. Five patients (12.0%) had a Popeye sign and one patient (3%) exhibited biceps subsidence. 86% of patients were self-rated as good to excellent, with the remaining 14% reporting fair or poor results.
