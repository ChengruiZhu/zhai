Many proteins perform their jobs as part of multi-protein units called complexes, and several technologies exist to identify these complexes and their components with varying precision and throughput. In this work, we describe and apply a computational framework for combining a variety of experimental data to identify pairs of yeast proteins that partipicate in a complexâ€”so-called co-complexed protein pairs (CCPPs). The method uses machine learning to generalize from well-characterized CCPPs, making predictions of novel CCPPs on the basis of sequence similarity, tandem affinity mass spectrometry data, yeast two-hybrid data, genetic interactions, microarray expression data, ChIP-chip assays, and colocalization by fluorescence microscopy. The resulting model accurately summarizes this heterogeneous body of data: in a cross-validated test, the model achieves an estimated coverage of 89% at a false discovery rate of 10%. The final collection of predicted CCPPs is available as a public resource. These predictions, as well as the general methodology described here, provide a valuable summary of diverse yeast interaction data and generate quantitative, testable hypotheses about novel CCPPs.
