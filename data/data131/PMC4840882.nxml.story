In recent years, the incidence of laryngeal carcinoma has been on the increase. The aim of the present study was to examine the expression level of endothelin-1 (ET-1) in laryngeal carcinoma tissues and to establish its clinical significance. A total of 82 cases of laryngeal carcinoma tissues were examined, of which 27 cases were stage I, 34 were stage II, and 21 were stage III. The normal mucosal tissues beyond the surgical incision margin in the 82 laryngeal carcinoma patients were used as the normal control. An additional 80 tissue specimens collected from laryngeal carcinoma outpatients were used as benign lesions. ET-1 expression levels in different tissues were determined using streptavidin-peroxidase (SP) immunohistochemistry. The results showed that the ET-1 expression level was highest in laryngeal carcinoma tissues and was significantly higher than that in the other two groups (P<0.05). The ET-1 expression level was higher in stage III compared to that in stage I and II (P<0.05) and higher than that of the normal control (P<0.05). The ET-1 expression level was higher in stage II compared to that in stage I (P<0.05). In conclusion, ET-1 was strongly expressed in laryngeal carcinoma tissues and may play an important role in the pathogenesis and development of laryngeal carcinoma tissues. ET-1 expression in laryngeal carcinoma tissues was associated with the clinical staging of laryngeal carcinoma.
