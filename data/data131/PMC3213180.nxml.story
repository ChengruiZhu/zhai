Loss of replication fork integrity is a primary source of genetic instability. In eukaryotes DNA synthesis is rapidly followed by its assembly into chromatin, and these two processes are tightly connected. Defective chromatin assembly mutants accumulate DNA damage and are sensitive to genotoxic agents, even though the mechanisms responsible for this genetic instability remain unclear because chromatin assembly also plays essential roles in transcription, silencing, DNA repair, and checkpoint signaling. A good example is the acetylation of histone H3 at lysine 56, which promotes histone deposition by the chromatin assembly factors CAF1 and Rtt106. In this case, the absence of this modification also causes a loss of structural and/or coding information at chromatin. Here we show that defective replication-coupled chromatin assembly leads to an accumulation of recombinogenic DNA damage by affecting the integrity of advancing, but not stalled, replication forks. Therefore, we propose that H3K56ac/CAF1/Rtt106-dependent chromatin assembly provides a mechanism for the stabilization of replication forks. Besides, H3K56 acetylation promotes replicative DNA damage repair/tolerance through a function that is independent of CAF1/Rtt106 and likely subsequent to its deposition at chromatin, revealing this modification as a key regulator of genome integrity.
