 T cells were stimulated with anti‐CD3/CD28 for 72 hrs in the presence or absence of tetrandrine under the Th17‐polarizing condition. Tetrandrine inhibited the phosphorylation of signal transducer and activator of transcription‐3 (STAT3) and boosted the phosphorylation of STAT5, while it did not alter the expression levels of phospho‐Janus kinase‐1 (p‐JAK1), p‐JAK2, p‐JAK3, and suppressor of cytokine signalling‐3 (SOCS3). The tetrandrine‐mediated inhibition of the Th17 cell differentiation could be diminished by the activator of STAT3 and the inhibitor of STAT5. Meanwhile, the effect of tetrandrine on the either STAT3 or STAT5 phosphorylation was almost completely reversed by the AhR antagonist CH223191 and the AhR knockdown. In CIA mice, tetrandrine decreased p‐STAT3 levels and increased p‐STAT5 levels, which could also be reversed by the AhR antagonist resveratrol administration. Furthermore, tetrandrine promoted the AhR binding to the STAT5, but not to the STAT3. The tetrandrine‐induced inhibition of the STAT3 phosphorylation was diminished by the inhibitor of STAT5. Taken together, tetrandrine suppressed Th17 cell differentiation by reciprocally modulating the activities of STAT3 and STAT5 in an AhR‐dependent manner.
