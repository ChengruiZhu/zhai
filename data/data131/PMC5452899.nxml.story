The correlation between the expression level of microRNA (miR)-655 in esophageal cancer with proliferation, invasion and prognosis was investigated. Reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction technique was used to detect the expression level of miR-655 in esophageal cancer cell lines KYSE410 and EC9706, tumor tissues and normal cancer-adjacent tissues of 63 cases of patients with esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC). The expression of miR-655 was upregulated in ESCC cells through the transfection of miR-655 mimics, and the influence of miR-655 on proliferation and invasion ability of ESCC cells was observed. Combined with the clinical data, the correlation between the expression of miR-655 and the prognosis of esophageal cancer was analyzed. The expression of miR-655 was downregulated in 2 ESCC cell lines and 73.02% of ESCC tissues. The results showed that the increased expression of miR-655 via transfection of mimics inhibited the proliferation and invasion ability of ESCC cells. Combined with clinical data analysis, it was found that the low-expression of miR-655 was related to poorer progression-free survival. In conclusion, the high-expression of miR-655 can inhibit the proliferation and invasion of ESCC, and plays a negative regulation role in the prognosis process of tumor patients. The targeted regulation of miR-655 can be used as a new treatment method of ESCC.
