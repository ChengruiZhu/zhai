Proteins evolve new protein-protein interactions through changes to their residues. Many residue changes are harmful because they disrupt important existing interactions and functions. The more interactions a protein participates in, the more difficult it is to make changes that are not harmful to the protein. And yet, proteins with many existing interactions are also likely to evolve new functions or new interactions. How does evolution occur in the context of a well-constrained protein with many interactions? We studied the heterotrimeric G protein subunit Gα, a multi-functional protein that acts at the nexus between receptors responding to extracellular signals and the cytoplasmic proteins driving the response within the cell. The Gα subunit participates in numerous interactions that have constrained much of Gα evolution; yet Gα has diversified into four functionally specialized classes. We developed an approach that identifies key residue changes important to the evolution of Gα functionality and class, and gained insight into the types of residue changes that occurred both early and late in the evolution of Gα function. By studying these critical residues in Gα we can de-couple the many functionalities of this signaling nexus.
