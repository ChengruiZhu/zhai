Diastolic heart failure is a common clinical entity that is indistinguishable from systolic heart failure without direct evaluation of left ventricular function. Diastolic heart failure is a clinical diagnosis in patients with signs and symptoms of heart failure but with preserved left ventricular function and normal ejection fraction, and is often seen in patients with a long-standing history of hypertension or infiltrative cardiac diseases. In contrast, diastolic dysfunction represents a mechanical malfunction of the relaxation of the left ventricular chamber that is primarily diagnosed by two-dimensional transthoracic echocardiography and usually does not present clinically as heart failure. The abnormal relaxation is usually separated in different degrees, based on the severity of reduction in passive compliance and active myocardial relaxation. The question whether diastolic dysfunction ultimately will lead to diastolic heart failure is critically reviewed, based on data from the literature. Treatment recommendations for diastolic heart failure are primarily targeted at risk reduction and symptom relief. Currently, few data only are reported on diastolic dysfunction and its progression to systolic heart failure.
