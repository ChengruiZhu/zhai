iPSC technology has the potential to revolutionize stem-cell based regenerative medicine and would also allow for the production of patient-specific cells for disease modeling and drug discovery. One of the primary safety concerns of iPSCs is genetic instability, which is associated with cancer and various other diseases and includes abnormalities in both chromosomal structure and number. Whereas certain structural chromosome changes have been shown to preclude somatic cell reprogramming, the effect of whole-chromosome reshuffling on this process is completely unknown. Here we show that BubR1 and RanBP2 hypomorphic MEF lines, which are highly prone to erroneous chromosome segregation due to mitotic checkpoint and DNA decatenation failure, respectively, reprogram to pluripotency with normal efficiency. However, while RanBP2 hypomorphic MEFs yielded karyotypically normal iPSC clones with generally low chromosomal instability rates, BubR1 hypomorphic MEFs almost exclusively yielded aneuploid iPSC clones with high instability rates. These data provide important new insights into the genomic integrity requirements during somatic cell reprogramming, and they establish that the safe application of iPSC technology requires screening of both iPSCs and the iPSC-founder cells for chromosome number instability.
