We examined how effective connectivity into and out of the left and right temporoparietal areas (TPAs) to/from other key cortical areas affected phonological decoding in 7 dyslexic readers (DRs) and 10 typical readers (TRs) who were young adults. Granger causality was used to compute the effective connectivity of the preparatory network 500 ms prior to presentation of nonwords that required phonological decoding. Neuromagnetic activity was analyzed within the low, medium, and high beta and gamma subbands. A mixed-model analysis determined whether connectivity to or from the left and right TPAs differed across connectivity direction (in vs. out), brain areas (right and left inferior frontal and ventral occipitalâ€“temporal and the contralateral TPA), reading group (DR vs. TR), and/or task performance. Within the low beta subband, better performance was associated with increased influence of the left TPA on other brain areas across both reading groups and poorer performance was associated with increased influence of the right TPA on other brain areas for DRs only. DRs were also found to have an increase in high gamma connectivity between the left TPA and other brain areas. This study suggests that hierarchal network structure rather than connectivity per se is important in determining phonological decoding performance.
