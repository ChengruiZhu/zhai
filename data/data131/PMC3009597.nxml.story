Key to robust discernment of cell circuit architecture is to have as many distinct response features as possible for comparison and evaluation. One under-appreciated characteristic of oscillatory circuits is that under periodic stimulation, these systems will exhibit responses synchronized to this stimulatory input, a phenomenon termed phase-locking. We demonstrate that phase-locked response characteristics vary noticeably depending on circuit activation and recovery properties; these response characteristics thereby provide a unique set of criteria for oscillatory circuit architecture analysis. The concept is validated through experiments on an oscillatory calcium pathway in mammalian cells; the experimental setup allowed us to explore, for the first time, the properties of chemically induced phase-locking of intracellular signals. Observations of this phenomenon were then used to test the predictions of several existing mathematical models of calcium signaling. Most of the models we evaluated were unable to match all our experimental observations, suggesting that current models are missing mechanistic elements in the context of calcium signaling for the cell type and receptor/stimulant tested. The observations of phase-locking further led us to identify one simple mechanistic modification that would account for all the experimental observations. The techniques and methodology presented should be broadly applicable to a variety of biological oscillators.
