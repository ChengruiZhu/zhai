Inter- and intra-tumour molecular heterogeneity is increasingly recognized in clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC). It may partially explain the diversity of responses to targeted therapies and the various clinical outcomes. In this study, a 56-year-old male ccRCC patient with multiple metastases received radical nephrectomy and resection of the metastatic tumour in chest wall. The surgical specimens were implanted into nude mice to establish patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models with KI2367 model derived from the primary tumour and KI2368 model from the metastastic tumour. The two modles were treated with Sorafenib, Sunitinib, Axitinib, combined Sorafenib/Sunitinib, or alternating therapy of Sorafenib and Sunitinib. Significant anti-tumour activity was found in KI2367 treated with Sorafenib/Sunitinib monotherapy, combined Sorafenib/Sunitinib, and alternating therapy of Sorafenib/Sunitinib (P<0.05) but not in that treated with Axitinib monotherapy. In contrast, KI2368 was significantly responsive to Sunitinib monotherapy, combined Sorafenib/Sunitinib therapy and alternating therapy of Sorafenib/Sunitinib but not responsive to Sorafenib and Axitinib monotherapy (P<0.05). RNAseq of the two models demonstrated that the expression levels of 1,725 genes including the drug targeted genes of
