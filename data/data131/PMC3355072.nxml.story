Inflammation is a fundamental response of animals to pathogen invasion. Among the first responders are macrophage cells, which identify and respond to multiple challenges. Their responses must be carefully regulated to kill invading pathogens without causing too much damage to host cells. Excessive activity of macrophages is associated with serious diseases like sclerosis and cancer. Macrophage responses are governed by a complex signaling network that receives cues, integrates information, implements appropriate responses and communicates with neighboring cells. This network must maintain a short-term memory of pathogen exposure. Endotoxin priming is an example. If macrophages are exposed to a small dose of bacterial toxins, they are primed to respond strongly to a second exposure to a large dose of toxin. Endotoxin tolerance, on the other hand, refers to the fact that macrophages are resistant to endotoxin challenges after a large dose pretreatment. The precise molecular mechanisms of both priming and tolerance are still poorly understood. Through computational systems biology, we have identified basic regulatory motifs for priming and for tolerance. Using information from databases and the literature, we have identified molecules that may contribute to priming and tolerance effects. Our methods are generally applicable to other types of cellular responses.
