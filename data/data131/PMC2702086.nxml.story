The detrimental effects of microbial infections have led to the evolution of a variety of host defense mechanisms. A vast array of host innate immunity receptors, critical sensors of viruses, bacteria, and fungi, exist to achieve permanent surveillance of intruding pathogens. The best characterized class of microbial sensors is the Toll-like receptor (TLR) family, which elicits inflammatory and antimicrobial responses after activation by microbial products. Here we investigated how microbes have exerted selective pressure on the human TLR family to gain insights on the extent to which they are functionally important in the immune system. By resequencing the ten TLRs in different worldwide populations, we show that intracellular TLRs—principally specialized in viral recognition—evolve under strong purifying selection, indicating their essential role in host survival, while the remaining TLRs display higher levels of immunological redundancy. However, for this latter group of genes, we also show that mutations altering immune responses have been in some cases beneficial for host survival, as attested by the signature of positive selection favoring a reduced TLR1-mediated response in Europeans. Our findings taken together indicate that the different human TLRs differ in their biological relevance and provide clues to be experimentally tested in clinical, immunological, and epidemiological studies.
