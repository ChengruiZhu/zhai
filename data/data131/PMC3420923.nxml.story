Ribosomes are the cellular factories that produce proteins. Making a ribosome is a complex and energy intensive process that requires hundreds of different factors. Ribosome biogenesis is an essential process, and therefore mutations that partially disrupt this process lead to disease. One such disease is North American Indian childhood cirrhosis (NAIC), which is caused by a mutation in a ribosome biogenesis protein called hUTP4/Cirhin. We looked for proteins that interact with hUTP4/Cirhin, since we hypothesized that disruption of this interaction could play a role in the development of NAIC. We identified a novel protein called NOL11, which is only found in animals and not in any other organisms. We showed that NOL11 is required for ribosome biogenesis and acts at one of the earliest steps in this process. We then showed that NOL11 interacts with the region of hUTP4/Cirhin that contains the NAIC mutation and that the NAIC mutation interferes with the interaction between hUTP4/Cirhin and NOL11. Further study of the interaction between hUTP4/Cirhin and NOL11 will give insight into the development of NAIC, as well as elucidate some of the differences in ribosome biogenesis between animals and other organisms.
