The cortex of primates consists of many areas that are highly interconnected, forming widespread functional networks engaged in specific tasks. Cortical areas frequently consist of submodules, columns, or patches of neurons that share functional properties. The neuronal characteristics of such clusters of neurons are determined by their inputs (i.e., from which neurons they receive information) and outputs (i.e., to which neurons in other brain areas they project), but detailed information about the connectivity of small clusters of neurons is frequently lacking. We applied electrical microstimulation during functional magnetic resonance imaging to chart the connectivity of small patches of neurons in the Intraparietal Sulcus, a brain region that has been implicated in many cognitive operations, such as motor planning, spatial attention, 3-D vision, and grasping. We observed that the three patches of neurons we studied were embedded in very distinct functional networks, covering almost the entire cortex. The network of brain areas connected to each patch could, in turn, explain the properties of the neurons in that patch. Thus, the connectivity of clusters of neurons provides crucial information to understand how functional brain networks support behavior.
