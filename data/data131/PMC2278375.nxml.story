Cancer is driven by genomic mutations that can range from single nucleotide changes to chromosomal aberrations that rearrange large pieces of DNA. Often, these chromosomal aberrations disrupt a gene sequence, and even fuse the sequences of two genes, producing a “fusion gene.” Fusion genes have been identified as key participants in the development of several types of cancer. Using genome-sequencing technology it is now possible to identify chromosomal aberrations genome-wide and at high resolution. In this paper, we address the question of how much sequencing is required to detect a chromosomal aberration and to determine the location of the aberration precisely enough to identify if a fusion gene is created by this aberration. We derive a mathematical formula that accurately predicts a number of fusion genes in a breast cancer sequencing study. We also demonstrate how the ability to detect chromosomal aberrations and fusion genes depends on both the size of the fusion gene and the parameters of the genome sequencing strategy that is used. These results will be useful in calibrating future cancer sequencing efforts, especially those using next-generation sequencing technologies.
