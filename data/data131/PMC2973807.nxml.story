Kinesin molecular motors provide a valuable model for uncovering the interplay between nanoscale mechanics and biochemistry at the level of single protein molecules. The mechanism by which kinesin motors “walk” along microtubules involves both conformational changes in the motor domains, or “heads”, as well as diffusive movements in which one head searches for its next binding site on the microtubule. This diffusive search is constrained by the 14 amino acid neck linker domain, which must be sufficiently flexible to allow the free head to diffuse forward, yet sufficiently stiff to enable mechanical communication to the rest of the molecule. We have modeled this diffusive search and integrated it into a stochastic model of the kinesin chemomechanical cycle. We find that modeling the neck linker as a Worm-Like Chain, the model most frequently used to describe unstructured polypeptide chains, results in motor behavior that conflicts with published experimental results for kinesins containing naturally or artificially extended neck linker domains. These results suggest that either the mechanical properties of the neck linker domain must be fundamentally reevaluated or that there are motor-microtubule interactions that stabilize the motor domain at its next binding site.
