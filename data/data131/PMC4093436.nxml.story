The purpose of this study was to explore the prevalence, severity, distress, and timing of neuropathic symptoms in cancer patients receiving taxanes and to explore neuropathy-related interference with activities. In this descriptive, cross-sectional study, 68 adult outpatients receiving paclitaxel (n = 36) and docetaxel (n = 32) completed the Chemotherapy Induced Peripheral Neuropathy Assessment Tool and a demographic questionnaire. Muscle or joint aches were the most prevalent symptom. Muscle or joint aches were also the most severe and distressing symptom in persons receiving paclitaxel. Participants receiving paclitaxel reported that neuropathic symptoms interfered with a mean of 7.3 (standard deviation [SD] = 4.1) of 14 activities. Nerve pain was the most severe and distressing symptom in persons receiving docetaxel. Participants receiving docetaxel reported that neuropathic symptoms interfered with a mean of 7.1 (SD = 4.1) of 14 activities. Numbness in the feet was the most frequent or constant symptom in persons receiving paclitaxel or docetaxel. Patients receiving paclitaxel and docetaxel experienced similar symptoms of peripheral neuropathy and interference with activities. Continued focus on treatment of painful neuropathy including myalgias and arthralgias is needed.
