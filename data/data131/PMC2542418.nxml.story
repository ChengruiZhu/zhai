A major goal of the study of developmental genetics is to understand the genes and developmental mechanisms underlying the formation of organismal complexity and diversity. Here, we focus on genes controlling postembryonic development and describe mutations in genes of the ectodysplasin (Eda) pathway in regulating the formation of the scales, skull, fins, and teeth. Mutations in genes of this signaling pathway are common in humans with defects in ectodermal structures such as hair, glands, and teeth. We show that the similar phenotypes of loss of Eda signaling in fish and human are due to a conserved early developmental stage in the development of mammalian hair and fish scales; subsequent development of these two structures diverge. Our findings show that the Eda signaling pathway has an ancestral role in regulating the developmental interactions involved in patterning and growth of the dermal skeleton of fish. Recent work has shown that these genes are associated with morphological variation between humans and evolution within fish populations, suggesting that alteration in the function of these genes permits viable morphological change. Our data support the value of forward genetic studies on postembryonic development to reveal the genetic and developmental basis of both human disease and morphological evolution.
