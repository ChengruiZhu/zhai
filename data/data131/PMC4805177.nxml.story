One of the major events in human evolution is the significant increase in brain volume in the transition from primates to humans. The molecular pathways determining the larger size of the human brain are not fully understood. Hereditary primary microcephaly, a neurodevelopmental disorder in which infants are born with small head circumference and reduced brain volume with intellectual disability, offers insights to the embryonic molecular pathways determining human brain size. Previous studies have shown that human microcephaly can be caused by mutations in genes affecting cell division processes, such as cell cycle regulation, DNA replication, primary cilia formation and centriole and centrosome duplication. We now show a novel molecular pathway determining human brain size: human primary microcephaly can be caused by a mutation in ALFY, a gene that encodes an autophagy scaffold protein. In fact, transgenic flies over expressing the mutant form of human ALFY recapitulate the human disease phenotype of microcephaly. We show the molecular pathway through which ALFY regulates cell division and differentiation: we demonstrate that ALFY normally controls removal of aggregate of DVL3, and through this regulates Wnt signaling, a major molecular pathway in embryogenesis. Thus, Wnt signaling, controlled by ALFY-mediated aggregate removal of DVL3, determines human brain size and human microcephaly.
