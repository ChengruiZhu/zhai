Since the late 19th century, rhythmic electrical activity has been observed in the mammalian brain. Although subject to intense scrutiny, only a handful of these rhythms are understood in terms of the biophysical elements that produce the oscillations. Even less understood are the mechanisms that underlie interactions between rhythms; how do rhythms of different frequencies coexist and affect one another in the dynamic environment of the brain? In this article, we consider a recent proposal for a novel mechanism of cortical rhythm generation: period concatenation, in which the periods of faster rhythms sum to produce a slower oscillation. To model this phenomenon, we implement simple—yet biophysical—computational models of the individual neurons that produce the brain's voltage activity. We utilize established models for the faster rhythms, and unite these in a particular way to generate a slower oscillation. Through the combined approach of experimental recordings (from thin sections of rat cortex) and mathematical modeling, we identify the cell types, synaptic connections, and ionic currents involved in rhythm generation through period concatenation. In this way the brain may generate new activity through the combination of preexisting elements.
