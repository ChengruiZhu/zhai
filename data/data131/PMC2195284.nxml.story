, incubated with galactose remains at a constant level for 100 minutes. This is 30 minutes beyond the time at which the oxidative phase of the induced-enzyme formation begins. Washed yeast cells, the pools of which have been depleted 60 per cent by incubation with glucose, do not replenish their pools as do washed cells incubated without a substrate. These facts indicate that the induced enzymes are formed at least partially from pool-replenishing amino acids. The time of onset of pool depletion is the time at which the aerobic fermentation phase of induced-enzyme formation begins for cells incubated with galactose. With 0.1 per cent galactose the respiratory phase begins at 100 minutes but no aerobic fermentation nor pool depletion occurs. The rates of respiration and aerobic fermentation are constant for four glucose concentrations from 0.1 to 1.0 per cent. The amount of aerobicfermentation is proportional to the initial concentration of glucose. Amino acid pool depletion occurs for all concentrations but depletion ceases and is followed by pool replenishment after aerobic fermentation is complete. Ultraviolet radiations, which delay the appearance of the respiratory phase of induced-enzyme formation, completely eliminate both the appearance of aerobic fermentation and pool depletion. The results indicate an intimate association between aerobic fermentation and amino acid pool depletion.
