Total 51 cases (serotype Karp 24, Irie/Kawasaki 19, Hirano/Kuroki 8)Â of ST were confirmed by elevated specific IgM and IgG in the paired sera and the positivity by real-time PCR analysis of eschars. Non-eschar cases were found in 5/51 (9.8%): one of Karp, one of Irie/Kawasaki and three of Hirano/Kuroki. Two eschars were found in a case of Irie/Kawasaki. Total 47 eschars were found in the diagnosed cases. In terms of sex differences, eschars from abdomen to thighs including genitalia were found 4/17 (24%) in men and 17/30 (57%) in women, which is more than twice as high than men. In contrast, eschars in lower extremities from calves to feet were found 5/17(29%) in men and 1/30 (3%) in women. There was no eschar in genitalia and hips in men. In terms of serological type differences, eschars of Karp were found in all of parts of bodies (head, neck, upper extremities, chest, back, abdomen, genitalia, hips, knees/popliteal fossae, and feet). In contrast, no eschar was found in genitalia and hips in Irie/Kawasaki and Hirano/Kuroki. No eschar was found in head, neck and feet in Hirano/Kuroki as well. The contact body sites by vectors, behavior pattern of the patients (passage in women, etc.) and preference to human, such as slow-biter with migration to genitalia or axillae as
