Inflammatory immune responses triggered initially to clear West Nile virus (WNV) infection later become detrimental and contribute to the pathological processes such as bloodâ€“brain barrier (BBB) disruption and neuronal death, thus complicating WNV-associated encephalitis (WNVE). It has been demonstrated previously that WNV infection in astrocytes results in induction of multiple matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), which mediate BBB disruption. Cyclooxygenase (COX) enzymes and their product, prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), modulate neuroinflammation and regulate the production of multiple inflammatory molecules including MMPs. Therefore, this study determined and characterized the pathophysiological consequences of the expression of COX enzymes in human brain cortical astrocytes (HBCAs) following WNV infection. Whilst COX-1 mRNA expression did not change, WNV infection significantly induced RNA and protein expression of COX-2 in HBCAs. Similarly, PGE2 production was also enhanced significantly in infected HBCAs and was blocked in the presence of the COX-2-specific inhibitor NS-398, thus suggesting that COX-2, and not COX-1, was the source of the increased PGE2. Treatment of infected HBCAs with NS-398 attenuated the expression of MMP-1, -3 and -9 in a dose-dependent manner. Similarly, expression of interleukin-1
