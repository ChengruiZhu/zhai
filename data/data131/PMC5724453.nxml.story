Irradiation of the cranio‐spinal axis is often one of the treatment modalities of certain childhood cancers, e.g., medulloblastoma. In order to achieve a uniform dose to the spinal cord, missing tissue compensators are required. In the past, our practice was to fabricate compensators out of strips of lead. We report on the use of intensity modulated fields to achieve the desired compensation. Seven cases of pediatric cancer whose treatment involved irradiation of the cranio‐spinal axis had compensators designed using a beam intensity modulation method rather than making mechanical compensators. The compensators only adjusted for missing tissue along the spinal axis. Comparisons between calculated and measured doses were made at depth in phantoms and on the surface of the patient. The intensity modulated fields were delivered using a step‐and‐shoot delivery on an Elekta SL20 accelerator equipped with multileaf collimator. The intensity‐modulated compensators provided more flexibility in design than the physical compensator method. Finer intensity steps were achievable, more accurate dose distributions were able to be calculated, and adjustments during treatment, e.g., junction changes, were more easily implemented. Convolution/superposition dose calculations were within
