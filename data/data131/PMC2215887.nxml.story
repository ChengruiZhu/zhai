The possible involvement of phosphodiesterase (PDE) activation in phototransduction was investigated in gecko photoreceptors by comparing the in situ PDE activity with the photoreceptor potential. In the dark, intracellular injection of cGMP into a gecko photoreceptor caused a long-lasting depolarization. An intense light flash given during the depolarization phase repolarized the cell with a short latency comparable to that of the light-evoked hyperpolarizing response, which indicates that the activation of PDE in situ is rapid enough to generate the photoreceptor potential. PDE activity in situ was estimated quantitatively from the duration of the cGMP-induced depolarization, since it was expected that the higher the PDE activity, the shorter the duration. Under steady illumination, the enzyme exhibited a constant activity. On exposure to a light flash, PDE became activated, but recovered in the dark with a time course that was dependent on the intensity of the preceding stimulus. When PDE activity and photoreceptor sensitivity to light were measured in the same cell after a light flash, both recovery processes showed similar kinetics. Theoretical analysis showed that the parallelism in the recovery time courses could be explained if cGMP is the transduction messenger. These results suggest that PDE activation is involved not only in the generation but also in the adaptation mechanisms of the photoreceptor potential.
