With the incidence rate of oral carcinogenesis increasing in the Southeast-Asian countries, due to increase in the consumption of tobacco and betel quid as well as infection from human papillomavirus, specifically type 16, it becomes crucial to predict the transition of premalignant lesion to cancerous tissue at an initial stage in order to control the process of oncogenesis. DEPDC1B, downregulated in the presence of E2 protein, was recently found to be overexpressed in oral cancer, which can possibly be explained by the disruption of the E2 open reading frame upon the integration of viral genome into the host genome. DEPDC1B mediates its effect by directly interacting with Rac1 protein, which is known to regulate important cell signaling pathways. Therefore, DEPDC1B can be a potential biomarker as well as a therapeutic target for diagnosing and curing the disease. However, the lack of 3D model of the structure makes the utilization of DEPDC1B as a therapeutic target difficult. The present study focuses on the prediction of a suitable 3D model of the protein as well as the analysis of protein-protein interaction between DEPDC1B and Rac1 protein using PatchDock web server along with the identification of allosteric or regulatory sites of DEPDC1B.
