The expression levels of microribonucleic acid 34a (miR-34a) and miR-218 in the serum and tumor tissues of patients with cervical cancer were investigated to explore their relationship with the diagnosis of cervical cancer. Fifty patients with cervical cancer were selected, and 30 normal patients were selected as the control group. The expression levels of miR-34a and miR-218 were detected by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction. The relationship between the expression of miR-34a and miR-218 was analyzed using Pearson's correlation coefficient, and the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was plotted for the analysis of values of the expression of miR-34a and miR-218. The correlation of the expressions of miR-34a and miR-218 in the serum with pathological parameters and the prognosis was analyzed. The expression levels of miR-34a and miR-218 in cervical cancer patients were significantly lower than those in normal patients. The ROC curve showed the area under curve (AUC) of miR-34a was 0.893, and miR-218 was 0.794. The low expression of miR-34a in patients with cervical cancer was correlated with the degree of tumor differentiation, lymph node metastasis and the International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics staging. The low expression of miR-218 was related to the degree of differentiation as well as invasion and metastasis. The 5-year overall survival rate of patients was 66%, and the low expression of miR-34a and miR-218 indicated a worse survival prognosis. The low expression of miR-34a in patients with cervical cancer is related to the degree of tumor differentiation as well as invasion and metastasis, and the low expression of miR-218 is related to the degree of tumor differentiation, invasion and metastasis and clinical staging. miR-34a and miR-218 in the serum can be used as markers for the diagnosis of cervical cancer and reference indicators for the evaluation of prognosis.
