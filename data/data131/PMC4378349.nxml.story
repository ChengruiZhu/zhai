This study was conducted to investigate the effects of the degree of participation in swimming lessons and the participation styles on health perception and belief. To do this, several analyses were conducted—statistical analysis, frequency analysis, factorial analysis, reliability analysis, correlation analysis, and regression analysis—using SPSS 18.0. A total of 300 copies of the questionnaire were distributed and after excluding those that are considered invalid, only 278 copies were used for the study. As a result, first, for the participants for “30 min–1 h,” “1 h–2 h,” and “more than 2 h” in time and “2–3 times a week” and “4–5 times a week” in frequency, swimming lessons in types had a significant effect on health interest and health concern. Second, participants for “30 min–1 h” and “1 h–2 h” in time and “hard’ in intensity had a significant effect on resistance and sensitivity. Third, all frequencies and intensities excluding the participants for “15 min-30 min.” and “swimming lessons” in types had a significant effect on perceived benefit. Fourth, all participants for a time period did not have a significant effect on the perceived disability, but they all had a significant effect on the former in terms of frequency and intensity. This being said, however, the participating types did not have any a significant effect.
