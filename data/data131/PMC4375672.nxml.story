The hyphenation of high performance chromatography with modern mass spectrometric techniques providing high-resolution data as well as structural information from MS/MS experiments has become a versatile tool for rapid natural product identification and characterization. A recent application of this methodology concerned the investigation of the annually occurring degradation of green plant pigments. Since the first structural elucidation of a breakdown product in the early 1990s, a number of similarly structured, tetrapyrrolic catabolites have been discovered with the help of chromatographic, spectroscopic and spectrometric methods. A prerequisite for a satisfactory, manually operated or database supported analysis of mass spectrometric fragmentation patterns is a deeper knowledge of the underlying gas phase chemistry. Still, a thorough investigation of the common fragmentation behavior of these ubiquitous, naturally occurring chlorophyll breakdown products is lacking. This study closes the gap and gives a comprehensive overview of collision-induced fragmentation reactions of a tetrapyrrolic nonfluorescent chlorophyll catabolite, which is intended to serve as a model compound for the substance class of phyllobilins.
