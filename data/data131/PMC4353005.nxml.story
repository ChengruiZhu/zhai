We examined the level of satisfaction with cognitive rehabilitation delivered via the Internet in persons with moderate to severe acquired brain injury (ABI). Fifteen adults with moderate to severe ABI were randomized to 30 days of Internet-based active treatment (AT) or to a wait list (WL) group, and crossed over to the opposite condition after 30 sessions. Both caregivers and participants were assessed at three time points during the study. This study focused on participant satisfaction with receiving treatment in this manner. Though the results of this study showed no significant treatment effect, the vast majority of participants (>87%) were satisfied with treatment. Treatment satisfaction accounted for 25% of additional variance in predicting lower family ratings of mood difficulties after final assessment (p<.03). Greater satisfaction with treatment was positively correlated with greater employment rate after treatment (r=.63, p=.02), as well as lower family ratings of memory and mood difficulties after final assessment (r=−.59, p=.03; r=−.58, p=.03,). Results suggest that treatment satisfaction in persons with ABI is related to less activity limitations, and maintaining employment after cognitive rehabilitation delivered via the Internet.
