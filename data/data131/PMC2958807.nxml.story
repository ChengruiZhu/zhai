Bacteria exchange DNA in their natural environments. The process called conjugation consists of DNA transfer by cell contact from one bacterium to another. Conjugative circular plasmids have been identified as shuttles and reservoirs for adaptive genes. It is now established that such lateral gene transfer plays an essential role, especially for the antibiotic resistance development and dissemination among bacteria. Moreover, integrons, platforms of mobile gene cassettes, have been instrumental in this phenomenon, through their successful association with conjugative resistance plasmids. We demonstrate in this study that the conjugative transfer of plasmids triggers a bacterial stress response—the SOS response—in recipient cells and can impact the cassette content of integrons. The SOS response is already known to induce various genome modifications. Human and animal pathogens cohabit with environmental bacteria, in niches which will favor DNA exchange. SOS induction during conjugation is thus most probably able to impact a wide range of genomes. Bacterial SOS response could then be a suitable target for co-treatment of infections in order to prevent exchange of antibiotic resistance/adaptation genes.
