Advances in next-generation sequencing technologies are revolutionizing molecular biology. Sequencing-enabled cost-effective characterization of microbial genomes is a particularly exciting development in metabolic engineering. There, considerable effort has been put to reconstructing genome-scale metabolic networks that describe the collection of hundreds to thousands of biochemical reactions available for a microbial cell. These network models are instrumental in understanding microbial metabolism and guiding metabolic engineering efforts to improve biochemical yields. We have developed a novel computational method, CoReCo, which bridges the growing gap between the availability of sequenced genomes and respective reconstructed metabolic networks. The method reconstructs genome-scale metabolic networks simultaneously for related microbial species. It utilizes the available sequencing data from these species to correct for incomplete and missing data. We used the method to reconstruct metabolic networks for a set of 49 fungal species providing the method protein sequence data and a phylogenetic tree describing the evolutionary relationships between the species. We demonstrate the applicability of the method by comparing a metabolic reconstruction of
