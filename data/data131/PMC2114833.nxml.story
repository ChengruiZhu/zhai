Extracellular cAMP induces excitation of adenylate and guanylate cyclase in Dictyostelium discoideum. Continuous stimulation with cAMP leads to adaptation, while cells deadapt upon removal of the cAMP stimulus. Excitation of guanylate cyclase by cAMP has a lag time of approximately 1 s; excitation of adenylate cyclase is much slower with a lag time of 30 s. Excitation of both enzyme activities is less than twofold slower at 0 degrees C than at 20 degrees C. Adaptation of guanylate cyclase is very fast (t1/2 = 2.4 s at 20 degrees C), and virtually absent at 0 degrees C. Adaptation of adenylate cyclase is much slower (t1/2 = 110 s at 20 degrees C) but not very temperature sensitive (t1/2 = 290 s at 0 degrees C). At 20 degrees C, deadaptation of adenylate cyclase is about twofold slower than deadaptation of guanylate cyclase (t1/2 = 190 and 95 s, respectively). Deadaptation of adenylate cyclase is absent at 0 degrees C, while that of guanylate cyclase proceeds slowly (t1/2 = 975 s). The results show that excitation, adaptation, and deadaptation of guanylate cyclase have different kinetics and temperature sensitivities than those of adenylate cyclase, and therefore are probably independent processes.
