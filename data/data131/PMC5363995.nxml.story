Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have been tremendously successful in identifying genetic variants that impact complex diseases. However, the roles of such studies in disease etiology remain poorly understood, primarily because a large proportion of the GWAS findings are located in the non-coding region of the genome. Recent advancements in high-throughput sequencing technology enable the systematic investigation of molecular quantitative trait loci (QTLs), which are genetic variants that directly affect molecular phenotypes (e.g., gene expression, transcription factor binding and DNA methylation). Linking molecular QTLs to GWAS findings intuitively represents an important step for interpreting the biological and clinical relevance of the GWAS results. In this paper, we describe a rigorous and efficient computational approach that assesses the enrichment and overlap between the GWAS findings and molecular QTLs. Importantly, we illustrate that the accurate quantification of overlapping between molecular QTL and GWAS signals requires reliable enrichment estimation. Our proposed approach fully accounts for the intrinsic uncertainty embedded in the association analyses of GWAS and molecular QTL mapping, and it outperforms the existing state-of-the-art approaches. Applying the proposed approach to the GWAS data of blood lipid traits and the whole blood expression QTLs (eQTLs) yields some novel biological insights and also illustrates the potential limitations of the currently available molecular QTL data.
