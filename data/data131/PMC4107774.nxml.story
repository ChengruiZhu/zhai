The Hippo tumour suppressor pathway co-ordinates cell proliferation, cell death and cell differentiation to regulate tissue growth control. In mammals, a conserved core Hippo signalling module receives signal inputs on different levels to ensure the proper regulation of YAP/TAZ activities as transcriptional co-activators. While the core module members MST1/2, Salvador, LATS1/2 and MOB1 have been attributed tumour suppressive functions, YAP/TAZ have been mainly described to have oncogenic roles, although some reports provided evidence supporting growth suppressive roles of YAP/TAZ in certain cancer settings. Intriguingly, mammalian Hippo signalling is also implicated in non-cancer diseases and plays a role in tissue regeneration following injury. Cumulatively, these findings indicate that the pharmacological inhibition or activation of the Hippo pathway could be desirable depending on the disease context. In this review, we first summarise the functions of the mammalian Hippo pathway in tumour formation, and then discuss non-cancer diseases involving Hippo signalling core components with a specific focus on our current understanding of the non-cancer roles of MST1/2 and YAP/TAZ. In addition, the pros and cons of possible pharmacological interventions with Hippo signalling will be reviewed, with particular emphasis on anti-cancer drug development and regenerative medicine.
