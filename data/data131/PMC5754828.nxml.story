A previous study has reported that frequent amplifications of the TG-interacting factor (TGIF) were observed in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma. The aim of the present study was to investigate the potential role of TGIF in the proliferation and tumorigenicity of the esophageal cancer cell line EC109 and cisplatin-induced apoptosis. Stable TGIF-knockdown EC109 cell line was established by infecting short hairpin RNA (shRNA) lentiviral particles. Soft agar and tumor xenograft assays were applied in nude mice. Flow cytometry was employed to evaluate the cell cycle and apoptosis. Western blot analysis was used to detect the expression of proteins. TGIF knockdown suppressed EC109 cell proliferation, colony formation in soft agar and tumor growth in nude mice, induced cell cycle arrest in the G1 phase, and promoted cisplatin-induced apoptosis. In addition, TGIF knockdown significantly reduced the expression of phospho-Rb in EC109 cells. The reduced level of full length PARP expression and the increased level of cleaved caspase-3 expression were observed in EC109 cells with the treatment of cisplatin and TGIF knockdown. The results suggest that knockdown of TGIF attenuated the proliferation and tumorigenicity of EC109 cells, and promoted cisplatin-induced apoptosis.
