A voltage-dependent, K+-selective ionic channel from sarcoplasmic reticulum of rabbit skeletal muscle has been studied in a planar phospholipid bilayer membrane. The puppose of this work is to study the mechanism by which the channel undergoes transitions between its conducting and nonconducting states. Thermodynamic studies show that the "open" and "closed" states of the channel exist in a voltage- dependent equilibrium, and that the channel displays only a single open state; the channel conductance is 120 pmho in 0.1 M K+. The channel's gating process follows single exponential kinetics at all voltages tested, and the individual opening and closing rate constants are exponentially dependent on voltage. The individual rate constants may also be determined from a stochastic analysis of channel fluctuations among multiple conductance levels. Neither the thermodynamic nor the kinetic parameters of gating depend on the absolute concentration of channels in the bilayer. The results are taken as evidence that the channel gates by an unusually simple two-state conformational mechanism in which the equivalent of 1.1 net charges are moved across the membrane during the formation of the open channel.
