Tissue glucocorticoid levels in the liver and adipose tissue are regulated by regeneration of inactive glucocorticoid by 11β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 1 (11β-HSD1) and inactivation by 5α- and 5β-reductases. A low carbohydrate diet increases hepatic 11β-HSD1 and reduces glucocorticoid metabolism during weight loss in obese humans. We hypothesized that similar variations in macronutrient proportions regulate glucocorticoid metabolism in obese rats. Male Lister Hooded rats were fed an obesity-inducing ad libitum ‘Western’ diet (37% fat, n = 36) for 22 weeks, then randomised to continue this diet (n = 12) or to switch to either a low carbohydrate (n = 12) or a moderate carbohydrate (n = 12) diet for the final 8 weeks. A parallel lean control group were fed an ad libitum control diet (10% fat, n = 12) throughout. The low and moderate carbohydrate diets decreased hepatic 11β-HSD1 mRNA compared with the Western diet (both 0.7±0.0 vs 0.9±0.1 AU; p<0.01), but did not alter 11β-HSD1 in adipose tissue. 5α-Reductase mRNA was increased on the low carbohydrate compared with the moderate carbohydrate diet. Compared with lean controls, the Western diet decreased 11β-HSD1 activity (1.6±0.1 vs 2.8±0.1 nmol/mcg protein/hr; p<0.001) and increased 5α-reductase and 5β-reductase mRNAs (1.9±0.3 vs 1.0±0.2 and 1.6±0.1 vs 1.0±0.1 AU respectively; p<0.01) in the liver, and reduced 11β-HSD1 mRNA and activity (both p<0.01) in adipose tissue. Although an obesity-inducing high fat diet in rats recapitulates the abnormal glucocorticoid metabolism associated with human obesity in liver (but not in adipose tissue), a low carbohydrate diet does not increase hepatic 11β-HSD1 in obese rats as occurs in humans.
