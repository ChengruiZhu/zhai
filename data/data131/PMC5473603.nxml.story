Porous tantalum (Ta) implants are highly corrosion resistant and biocompatible, and they possess significantly better initial stability than that of conventional titanium (Ti) implants. During loading wear, Ta nanoparticles (Ta-NPs) that were deposited on the surface of a porous Ta implant are inevitably released and come into direct contact with peri-implant osteoblasts. The wear debris may influence cell behavior and implant stabilization. However, the interaction of Ta-NPs with osteoblasts has not been clearly investigated. This study aimed to investigate the effect of Ta-NPs on cell proliferation and their underlying mechanism. The Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK-8) assay was used to measure the cell viability of MC3T3-E1 mouse osteoblasts and showed that Ta-NP treatment could increase cell viability. Then, confocal microscopy, Western blotting, and transmission electron microscopy were used to confirm the autophagy induced by Ta-NPs, and evidence of autophagy induction was observed as positive LC3 puncta, high-LC3-II expression, and autophagic vesicle ultrastructures. The CCK-8 assay revealed that the cell viability was further increased and decreased by the application of an autophagy inducer and inhibitor, respectively. In addition, pre-treatment with autophagy inhibitor 3-methyladenine (3-MA) inhibited the Ta-NP-induced autophagy. These results indicate that the Ta-NPs can promote cell proliferation, that an autophagy inducer can further strengthen this effect and that an autophagy inhibitor can weaken this effect. In conclusion, autophagy was involved in Ta-NP-induced cell proliferation and had a promoting effect.
