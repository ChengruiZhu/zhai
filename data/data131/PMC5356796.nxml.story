The present meta-analysis was intended to explore the relationship between the X-ray repair cross complementing 1 (XRCC1) polymorphisms (Arg194Trp, Arg280His and Arg399Gln) and cervical cancer risk. Several electronic databases were searched systematically and bibliographies of relevant papers were identified carefully. Then, a meta-analysis was performed based on eligible studies in various genetic models. Pooled odds ratios (OR) with 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) were employed to evaluate the strength of associations between the XRCC1 polymorphisms and cervical cancer risk. Additionally, heterogeneity analysis and sensitivity analysis were done if necessary. Totally, 11 articles involving 2092 cases and 2803 controls were included. Taken together, there was no obvious association between the Arg194Trp or Arg280His polymorphism and cervical cancer risk. Considering the great heterogeneity, subgroup analysis was done, but the pooled result remained stable. Nevertheless, the association between the Arg399Gln polymorphism and cervical cancer risk showed distinct statistic significance in the allele model, dominant model, homozygous model and heterozygous model. In view of the exiting heterogeneity, we did subgroup analysis stratified by ethnicity, resulting in the fact that the Arg399Gln polymorphism was related to the decreased risk of cervical cancer. The Begg's test and Egger's test were used to find no publication bias. To conclude, the current meta-analysis indicated that the XRCC1 Arg399Gln polymorphism decreased the risk of cervical cancer, while the Arg194Trp and Arg280His polymorphisms were not associated with cervical caner risk. Certainly, a well-designed large-scale multicenter study is warranted to confirm the finding.
