O) = (carbohydrate). 3. The maximum yield of the induced reduction is one-half molecule of carbon dioxide reduced for each molecule of oxygen absorbed. 4. Partial reactions are recognizable in the course of the formation of water and it is with the absorption of the second equivalent of hydrogen that the carbon dioxide reduction appears to be coupled. 5. The velocity of the reaction increases in proportion to the partial pressure of oxygen, but only up to a certain point where any excess of oxygen causes the inactivation of the hydrogenase system. The reaction then ends prematurely. 6. During the oxyhydrogen reaction little or no oxygen is consumed for normal respiratory processes. 7. Small concentrations of cyanide, affecting neither photosynthesis nor photoreduction in the same cells, first inhibit the induced reduction of carbon dioxide and then lead to a complete inactivation of the hydrogenase system. 8. Hydroxylamine, added after adaptation, has either no inhibitory effect at all, or prevents solely the induced reduction of carbon dioxide without inactivating the hydrogenase system. 9. Dinitrophenol prevents the dark reduction of carbon dioxide while the reduction of oxygen continues to the formation of water. 10. Glucose diminishes the absorption of hydrogen, probably in its capacity as a competing hydrogen donor. 11. The induced reduction of carbon dioxide can be described as an oxido-reduction similar to that produced photochemically in the same cells.
