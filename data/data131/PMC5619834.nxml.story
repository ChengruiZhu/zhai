The human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1) is a retrovirus that causes acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), an infectious disease with high annual mortality. Gag protein is the major structural protein of HIV-1 and can self-assemble into the HIV-1 sphere shell. Therefore, an in-depth understanding of Gag protein trafficking and polymerization is important for gaining further insights into the mechanisms of HIV-1 replication and the design of antiviral drugs. Through mathematical modeling, optimization and quantitative analysis, we hypothesized the budding and release time of virus-like particles and revealed that the dimer and trimer intermediates might be crucial in hexamer formation. We also concluded that the predominant pathways in hexamer formation might be the polymerization of two monomers to form a dimer, the polymerization of a dimer and a monomer to form a trimer, and the polymerization of two trimers to form a hexamer. Our analysis also suggested that the N-terminal glycine residue of the MA domain of Gag might be a promising drug target. These results serve as a guide for further theoretical and experimental efforts aiming to understand HIV-1 Gag trafficking and polymerization and could aid anti-AIDS drug design.
