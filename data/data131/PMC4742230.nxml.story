A central goal of personal genomics is to interpret an individual’s genome to identify variants that confer disease risk, an aim that has far-reaching implications for personalized, precision medicine. Here, we leverage next generation sequencing, health records, and functional genome annotations to develop statistical methods that predict disease risk from a single genome. Motivated by the fact that about 90% of genome-wide association study disease-associated variants lie in the non-coding genome, we identify personal variants that mutate conserved transcription factor binding sites. To identify if such non-coding personal variants collectively dysregulate a key biological process, we employ the enrichment analysis tool GREAT to identify if a person’s noncoding mutations are over-represented in the regulatory domains of genes involved in a common biological pathway. Notably, in five unrelated genomes we analyzed, the most statistically significant, seemingly dysregulated pathway is indicative of that person’s medical history, ranging from neuropathy to heart disease. Statistical analysis confirms that associations from our predicted pathway to an individual’s medical record are rigorous and significant in the context of the un-phenotyped, race-matched 1,000 Genomes cohort. As such, we present a novel method that leverages the contribution of multifactorial non-coding variation to predict disease risk in individual genomes.
