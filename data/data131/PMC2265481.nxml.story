Computational modeling is of importance in striving to understand the complex dynamic behavior of a neuron. In neuronal modeling, the function of the neuron's components, including the cell membrane and voltage-dependent ion channels, is typically described using deterministic ordinary differential equations that always provide the same model output when repeating computer simulations with fixed model parameter values. It is well known, however, that the behavior of neurons and voltage-dependent ion channels is stochastic in nature. A stochastic modeling approach based on probabilistically describing the transition rates of ion channels has therefore gained interest due to its ability to produce more accurate results than the deterministic approaches. These Markov chain type of models are, however, relatively time-consuming to simulate. Thus it is important to develop new modeling and simulation approaches that take into account the stochasticity inherently present in the function of ion channels. In this study, we seek new stochastic methods for modeling the dynamic behavior of neurons. We apply stochastic differential equations (SDEs) and Brownian motion that are also commonly used in the air space industry and in economics. An SDE is a differential equation in which one or more of the terms of the mathematical equation are stochastic processes. Computer simulations show that the irregular firing behavior of a small neuron, in our case the cerebellar granule cell, is reproduced more accurately in comparison to previous deterministic models. Furthermore, the computation is performed in a relatively fast manner compared to previous stochastic approaches. Additionally, the SDE method provides more sophisticated mathematical analysis tools compared to other, similar kinds of stochastic approaches. In the future, the new SDE model of the cerebellar granule cell can be used in studying the emergent behavior of cerebellar neural network circuitry.
