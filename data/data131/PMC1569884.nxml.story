The researchers purified antibodies from blood provided by patients with celiac disease when they were eating food containing gluten and when they were on a gluten-free diet. They used these to identify celiac peptide, a synthetic protein fragment that was recognized only by the antibodies made by patients with active disease. By searching a database of pathogen proteins, the researchers discovered that rotavirus protein VP-7 contains a very similar peptide; a search of a database of human proteins indicated that celiac peptide also resembles peptides found in tissue transglutaminase, Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4; a protein involved in the innate immune response), and several other self-antigens. Patient antibodies purified through their ability to bind to celiac peptide also bound to VP-7 and to these self-antigens, and only patients with active disease made these antibodies. The researchers also investigated whether these anti-celiac peptide antibodies might affect the gut or the innate immune system. The antibodies increased the permeability of a layer of gut cells growing in a laboratory dish by interacting with the self-antigen desmoglein 1. This protein helps to make impermeable seals between the cells that line the gut so that food antigens in the gut cannot seep out into the tissues where the immune system might detect them. In addition, by binding to TLR4, the anti-celiac peptide antibodies activated monocytesâ€”cells that function in both the innate and adaptive immune response.
