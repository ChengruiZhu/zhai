During vertebrate embryogenesis, cell proliferation, fate specification and cell movements are key processes that transform a fertilized egg into an embryo with head, trunk and tail. Cell proliferation is orchestrated by maternal and zygotic functions of conserved regulators including Cdc25a, and has generally been considered dispensable for embryonic axis elongation. Stat3 transcriptional factor, a known promoter of cell proliferation, is associated with human scoliosis, inflammation and cancer. Based on morpholino-mediated downregulation of Stat3 during zebrafish embryogenesis, Stat3 was previously proposed to regulate convergence and extension cell movements that narrow the embryonic body and elongate it from head to tail partially through planar cell polarity signaling and unknown transcriptional targets. Here, we report that zebrafish mutants lacking maternal and zygotic Stat3 expression exhibit normal convergence movements and planar cell polarity signaling, but transient axis elongation defect due to insufficient number of cells resulting largely from reduced cell proliferation and increased cell death. Accordingly, pharmacologic inhibition of cell proliferation also hinders axis elongation. Further experiments indicate that Stat3 promotes head- to -tail axis elongation by stimulating cell proliferation in part via upregulation of Cdc25a expression during oogenesis. During later development, zebrafish
