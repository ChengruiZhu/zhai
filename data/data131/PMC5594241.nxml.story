Human glioblastoma is one of the most malignant types of brain tumor in the world. In the present study, the functional mechanisms of microRNA-141 (miR-141) were assessed, and the potential role of miR-141 as a prognostic biomarker in glioblastoma was examined. The gene expression of miR-141 in glioblastoma cell lines and glioblastoma tumors was assessed by reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction. Glioblastoma LN229 and U89 cell lines were transfected with synthetic miR-141 mimics to upregulate endogenous miR-141. The subsequent effect on glioblastoma proliferation was assessed by MTT assay. In human glioblastoma, miR-141 expression was compared between patients with tumors of different pathological grades. Statistical analyses were performed to assess the correlation between miR-141 and the clinicopathological properties and overall survival rates (OS) of the patients. In addition, a Cox regression model was used to examine whether miR-141 was a potential biomarker of glioblastoma. miR-141 was aberrantly downregulated in glioblastoma cell lines and human glioblastoma tumors. Forced miR-141 upregulation in glioblastoma LN229 and U89 cell lines suppressed cancer proliferation. In patients with glioblastoma, miR-141 downregulation was closely associated with an advanced disease stage, poor clinicopathological properties and a shorter OS time. The multivariate Cox regression model demonstrated that low miR-141 expression was an effective prognostic biomarker for patients with glioblastoma. Overall, the present study showed that miR-141 may be a functional cancer regulator and a prognostic biomarker for glioblastoma.
