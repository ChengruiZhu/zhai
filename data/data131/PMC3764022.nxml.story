The Src family of protein kinases (SFKs) are integral in many cellular signaling pathways. Aberrant SFK activity correlates with the development of various cancers and autoimmune diseases. Csk regulates these kinases via phosphorylation of a tyrosine residue on the C-terminal tail of SFKs, leading to suppression of activity. Csk's SH2 domain is essential for function and understanding how sites within this domain influences Csk activity is of paramount importance. A structural divergence can be noted in the unique presence of a tight turn in Csk's SH2 domain when compared to the longer loops found in homologous kinase domains. We sought to study the importance of flexibility in this surface exposed, distal loop to the kinase's functional motions and found that enzyme activity and dynamics are sensitive to modifications at this site. Our complementary use of statistical computational methods coupled with structural and functional experimental methods helped reveal routes of intramolecular and long-range communications along Csk's framework. These insights may provide a general framework for identifying potential sites for specific targeting by design that aid in kinase activity modulation â€“ a therapeutic strategy of great importance and interest.
