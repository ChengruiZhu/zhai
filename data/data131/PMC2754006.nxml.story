Rotavirus is one of the most common causes of acute diarrhoea during infancy, and the spread of this infection due to rotavirus in paediatric wards can cause acute diarrhoea during hospitalization, and, in turn, prolong hospitalization or rehospitalization. It is, therefore, important to evaluate the problem and to find an appropriate approach to decrease the rate of infection. The incidence of nosocomial infection due to rotavirus was studied in 80 children aged 3-24 months from November 2003 to April 2004 in the Alzahra Hospital, Isfahan, Iran. Rotavirus antigen was detected by latex aggulutation in stool samples obtained during hospitalization and up to 72 hours after discharge from the hospital. The prevalence of nosocomial infection due to rotavirus was 26.25%, which is a considerable prevalence compared to similar studies which reported a prevalence of 27.7%, 19.4%, and 14.6%. Overall, 15% of the 21 children with positive rotavirus antigen in their stools had acute diarrhoea during hospitalization and up to 72 hours after discharge (symptomatic nosocomial infection), and 11.25% of all children (n=80) studied had asymptomatic nosocomial infection. Regarding the low frequency of nosocomial infection due to rotavirus in other studies which have only studied symptomatic cases during hospitalization and reported a prevalence of 3.3 and 9%, it is suggested that the real estimation of nosocomial infection due to rotavirus in asymptomatic cases that might become symptomatic after discharge from hospital should also be considered. Due to the relatively high frequency of nosocomial infection in the Alzahra Hospital, it is necessary to follow stricter health issues, e.g. isolation of patients with diarrhoea and hand-washing before and after the examination of every patient.
