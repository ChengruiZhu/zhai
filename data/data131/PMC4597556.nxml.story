A 3-year prospective cohort study was conducted with 220 high school female handball or basketball players. All subjects were 15 years old and included 77 handball players and 143 basketball players. At baseline, psychological competitive ability was assessed by a self-administered questionnaire, the Diagnostic Inventory of Psychological Competitive Ability (DIPCA.3). This inventory measures an athleteâ€™s psychological abilities to fully display their skills and talents during competition via 52 questions categorized into 12 scales: Patience, Aggressiveness, Volition for self-realization, Volition for winning, Self-control, Ability to relax, Concentration, Confidence, Decision, Predictive ability, Judgment, and Cooperation. After the baseline examination was performed at high school entry, all players were followed for 36 months to register any subsequent incidence of ACL injury. We compared the differences in psychological competitive ability between injured and uninjured players using an unpaired t-test. Values of p < 0.05 were considered statistically significant. The purpose of this study was explained to the subjects and their parents and written informed consent to participate was obtained from them. This study was approved by the ethics committee of our institution.
