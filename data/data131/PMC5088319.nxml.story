Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a multifactorial disease of the central nervous system (CNS) characterized by an inflammatory process and demyelination. The etiology of the disease is still not fully understood. Therefore, finding new etiological factors is of such crucial importance. It is suspected that the development of MS may be affected by oxidative stress (OS). In the acute phase OS initiates inflammatory processes and in the chronic phase it sustains neurodegeneration. Redox processes in MS are associated with mitochondrial dysfunction, dysregulation of axonal bioenergetics, iron accumulation in the brain, impaired oxidant/antioxidant balance, and OS memory. The present paper is a review of the current literature about the role of OS in MS and it focuses on all major aspects. The article explains the mechanisms of OS, reports unique biomarkers with regard to their clinical significance, and presents a poorly understood relationship between OS and neurodegeneration. It also provides novel methods of treatment, including the use of antioxidants and the role of antioxidants in neuroprotection. Furthermore, adding new drugs in the treatment of relapse may be useful. The article considers the significance of OS in the current treatment of MS patients.
