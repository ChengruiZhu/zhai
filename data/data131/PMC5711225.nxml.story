The purpose of this study was to develop new and modified tools that allow HDR brachytherapy quality assurance tests to be carried out efficiently without film, video cameras, stopwatches, and mechanical rulers; and to devise methods that use these new tools for daily and quarterly check procedures, which are efficient and provide increased accuracy compared to previous methods. The HDR brachytherapy system tested was the GammaMedplus iX, Ir‐192 HDR. Various catheters and treatment applicators designed for this system were tested. To measure the absolute position of the source, a simple tool was built that uses a Plexiglas frame, a template for applicator positioning, and a diode for radiation detection. For daily reproducibility and source strength tests, modifications were made of a Model 70008, HDR brachytherapy Ir‐192 quality assurance tool, which is used with the HDR‐1000‐Plus well‐type reentrant chamber. Measurement procedures and analysis protocols were developed that use the Microsoft Excel spreadsheet program. Independent determination of source positions was made with a computer video camera and radiochromic film. Using the new tool, for a straight catheter the measured source position is found to be within
