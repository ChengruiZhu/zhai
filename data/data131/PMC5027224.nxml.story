The landmark-based morphometric and meristic analysis of the kelp grouper (Epinephelus bruneus), red spotted grouper (E. akaara) and seven-banded grouper (E. septemfasciatus) were performed to compare the differentiation of overall body shape and structure. The measurements of the morphometric dimensions were observed in 25 parts (truss dimension: 16 parts; head part dimension: 9 parts) of 38 morphometric dimensions and also meristic differences observed in 3 parts (dorsal fin, anal fin and caudal fin) of 6 meristic counts (P < 0.05). Observed morphometric characteristics primarily involved in truss and head part dimension, kelp grouper have larger values in caudal part of truss dimension, kelp grouper, red spotted grouper and seven-banded grouper have similar values in pectoral part of truss dimension, in addition to, results of head part dimension showed that red spotted grouper have smaller values in overall dimensions (P < 0.05). As meristic characteristics, kelp grouper have more number of anal fin rays than other fish, red spotted grouper have more number of dorsal soft rays than other fish, and seven spotted grouper have more number of anal soft rays, and caudal fin rays than other fish (P < 0.05). Photographed under the x-ray, kelp grouper have the most curved vertebral column and largest swim bladder than other fishes (P < 0.05). Our results of this study confirmed that 3 subfamily fishes adequately can distinguish with external body shape, and we hope that the results of our study could be used to identify in Serranidae family as taxonomical parameters.
