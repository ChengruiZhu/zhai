Intraocular pressure, a major modifiable risk factor for glaucoma, has been shown to fluctuate throughout the day in patients with glaucoma. The detection and measurement of this fluctuation may help guide the clinical management of glaucomatous individuals. The Sensimed Triggerfish contact lens sensor (CLS), which has recently gained approval for marketing in the USA, is designed to detect intraocular pressure-related changes in an eye over a 24-hour period. This review will provide an overview of the Triggerfish CLS, as well as summarize current clinical data pertaining to the device. Overall, the current evidence suggests that the Triggerfish CLS is safe and well tolerated, and provides reproducible results. One challenge of using the Triggerfish CLS is that it may only provide data on relative changes in intraocular pressure rather than absolute intraocular pressure. In addition, its validity at estimating intraocular pressure compared to other methods is still controversial. Despite these limitations, recent studies suggest a myriad of potential indications for the Triggerfish CLS, including predicting glaucomatous progression and predicting efficacy of glaucoma treatment. With further research, the Triggerfish CLS may become a useful tool for eye care practitioners.
