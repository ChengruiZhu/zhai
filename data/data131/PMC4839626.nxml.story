The sea urchin embryo is similar to vertebrate embryos in that the default cell fate is potentially neurogenic, and normal development restricts the neural fate to the narrow area that locates at the anterior/dorsal region of the embryo. Because maintaining the default neural fate to the anterior/dorsal region is required for embryos to precisely integrate information from both the primary anterior-posterior and secondary dorsal-ventral body axes, these axes must be mutually linked by some mechanisms. In this study, we describe how the combination of orthogonally functioning signaling pathways regulates their targeting transcription factors expressing at the anterior neuroectoderm to restrict and pattern the default neurogenic region. By loss-of-function experiments using sea urchin embryos, we revealed that canonical and non-canonical Wnt pathways regulate the anterior neuroectoderm patterning along the primary axis, and TGF-ß signals control the patterning of the neuroectoderm along the secondary axis. In addition, we showed that the crosstalk between the Wnt and TGF-ß pathways was of importance in regulating the neuroectoderm patterning. As the default cell fate in some deuterostome embryos, including embryonic stem cells, is neurogenic, our findings could be widespread mechanisms to coordinate the remaining and/or suppressing developmental programs along different embryonic axes because Nodal and Wnt signals are critical in establishing early developmental polarities in many embryos.
