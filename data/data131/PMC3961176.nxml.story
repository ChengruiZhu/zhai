Cellular responses to stimuli are controlled by complex regulatory networks that comprise many molecular components. Understanding such networks is critical for understanding normal cellular functions and pathological conditions. Because the complexity of these networks often precludes intuitive insights, a useful approach is to study mathematical models of small network motifs having reduced complexity yet consisting of key regulatory components of the more complex networks. Computational studies have analyzed the behavior of small motifs, and have begun to describe the ways in which variations in parameters affect their functional properties. Here, we investigated how variations in pairs of parameters act synergistically (or antagonistically) to alter responses of ten common network motifs. Simulations identified parameter variations that maximized synergism, and examined the ways in which synergism was affected by stimulus protocols and motif architecture. The results have implications for the rational design of combination drug therapies where a goal is to identify drugs that when administered together have a greater effect than would be predicted by simple addition of single-drug effects (
