The past decade has seen a phenomenal rise in applications of functional magnetic resonance imaging for both research and clinical applications. Most of the applications, however, concentrate on finding the regions of the brain that mediate the processing of a cognitive/motor task without determining the interaction between the identified regions. It is, however, the interactions between the different regions that accomplish a given task. In this study, we have examined the interactions between three regions—Heshl's gyrus (HG), planum temporale (PT), and superior temporal sulcus (STS)—that have been implicated in processing the spectral envelope of sounds. The spectral envelope is one of the dimensions of timbre that determine the identity of two sounds that have the same pitch, duration, and intensity. The interaction between the regions is examined using a system-based mathematical modelling technique called dynamic causal modelling (DCM). It is found that flow of information is serial, with HG sending information to PT and then to STS with the connectivity between HG to PT being effectively increased by the extraction of spectral envelope. The study provides evidence for an earlier hypothesis that PT is a computational hub.
