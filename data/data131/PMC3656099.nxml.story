Folding dynamics is crucial for RNA function. Riboswitches are a classic example. A typical riboswitch senses the cellular concentration of a small molecule. By refolding itself into a new structure, the riboswitch converts that information into changes in rates for synthesis of related metabolites. Understanding how the small molecule physically changes RNA structure can help us to target riboswitches, which occur mainly in bacteria, for drug design, or to engineer new riboswitches. This understanding has been blocked because 1) we cannot view intermediate stages experimentally and 2) simulations cannot reach the timescale for the structural conversion. Recent advances in RNA structure modeling enable us to model intermediate states. A new computer specialized for long timescale molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, called Anton, helps us to extend the simulation timescale. We modeled intermediate riboswitch structures, focusing on a reduced segment of the structure-switching region, in order to reduce the time required for a transition. We simulated an MD trajectory in which a small molecule converted the structure of this reduced switching region. Some steps in riboswitch structural transitions are therefore accessible to the newly extended MD timescale. Wider availability of resources like Anton can aid the advancement of riboswitch engineering and novel antibiotic design.
