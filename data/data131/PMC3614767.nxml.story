Previous studies suggest that serum myeloperoxidase (MPO) is a potentially useful biomarker to risk stratify troponin-negative patients with suspected myocardial ischemia. We hypothesized that the relationship between initial serum MPO levels would correlate with 30-day adverse cardiac outcomes for low risk emergency department (ED) patients with suspected myocardial ischemia. This prospective cohort study enrolled ED patients with chest pain or suspected myocardial ischemia, non-diagnostic ECG, and initially negative cardiac troponin I. We defined 30-day adverse cardiac events as death, myocardial infarction, or coronary revascularization. We calculated summary statistics, standard deviation (SD), odds ratios (OR), 95% confidence intervals (CI), and receiver operating characteristics (ROC). We enrolled 159 patients who had a mean age of 55 Â± 13, were 56% female, of whom 5.2% suffered at least one adverse cardiac event. MPO test characteristics were poor, with an ROC area of only 0.47 (CI 0.23-0.71). MPO levels were not associated with adverse events (OR 0.99, CI 0.98-1.01, p=0.62). The optimal ROC cutpoint to predict adverse cardiac events had poor sensitivity and specificity (57% and 52%, respectively). Mean MPO concentrations in the event group did not differ from the non-event group. In this limited cohort of low risk ED patients with chest pain, we were unable to demonstrate utility of MPO for risk stratification. If confirmed in larger studies, these findings may call into question the routine use of MPO for low-risk chest pain.
