Basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF)-loaded liposome (bFGF-lip) combined with ultrasound-targeted microbubble destruction (UTMD) technique was investigated to prevent diabetic cardiomyopathy (DCM). Cardiac function and myocardial ultrastructure were assessed. Terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (TdT)-mediated dUTP nick-end labeling (TUNEL) staining, immunohistochemistry staining, and Western blot assay were used to investigate the signal pathway underlying the expression of bFGF in DCM treatment. From Mason staining and TUNEL staining, bFGF-lip + UTMD group showed significant differences from the diabetes group and other groups treated with bFGF or bFGF-lip. The diabetes group showed similar results (myocardial capillary density, collagen volume fraction, and cardiac myocyte apoptosis index) to other bFGF treatment groups. Indexes from transthoracic echocardiography and hemodynamic evaluation also proved the same conclusion. These results confirmed that the abnormalities including diastolic dysfunctions, myocardial fibrosis, and metabolic disturbances could be suppressed by the different extents of twice-weekly bFGF treatments for 12 consecutive weeks (free bFGF or bFGF-lip +/âˆ’ UTMD), with the strongest improvements observed in the bFGF-lip + UTMD group. The group combining bFGF-lip with UTMD demonstrated the highest level of bFGF expression among all the groups. The bFGF activated the PI3K/AKT signal pathway, causing the reduction of myocardial cell apoptosis and increase of microvascular density. This strategy using bFGF-lip and UTMD is a potential strategy in early intervention of DCM in diabetes.
