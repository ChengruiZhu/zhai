Twenty-one patients (22 knees) met the inclusion criteria for this study. Mean chronological age at time of surgery of 11.8 years (range: 9.9-14.3 years). All patients were male with a minimum of three years of growth remaining. There were four concomitant meniscal repairs and five concomitant partial meniscectomies performed at the index procedure. Of the included patients, 19 patients (20 knees)(90%) completed follow-up at mean postoperative duration of 3.1 years (range: 1.0-6.9 years). Two knees (9%) underwent revision ACL reconstruction for graft failure at 2.8 and 4.0 years postoperatively. Of the remaining 18 knees, the median patient satisfaction was 10 (range: 9 to 10). Mean pedi-IKDC knee score was 96.3± 2.9 points. Mean Lysholm score was 94.7 ± 6.2 points. Mean pre-injury Tegner activity level was 8 (range: 6-10) and mean postoperative Tegner activity level was 8 (range: 6-10). All patients had a normal Lachman examination with firm endpoint and a normal pivot-shift examination. At time of follow-up, 50% of patients had closed physes. There were no radiographic angular deformities or leg length discrepancies appreciated. Four of 18 knees (22%) underwent subsequent procedures including 1 graft shrinkage, 2 partial meniscectomies and 1 meniscal repair.
