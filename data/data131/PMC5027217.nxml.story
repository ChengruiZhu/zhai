Previously we observed that human adipose-derived stem cells (hADSCs) could form aggregation during culture in the presence of human serum (HS). In the present study, we have examined if the aggregation might result from the cell migration and analyzed the difference of cell adhesivity after culture in various conditions. When cells were cultured in fetal bovine serum (FBS) alone, there was no morphological change. Similarly, cells pretreated with FBS for 1 day or cultured in a mixture of FBS and HS showed little change. In contrast, cells cultured in HS alone exhibited formation of cell-free area (spacing) and/or cell aggregation. When cells cultured in FBS or pretreated with FBS were treated with 0.06% trypsin, almost cells remained attached to the dish surfaces. In contrast, when cells cultured in HS alone were examined, most cells detached from the dish by the same treatment. Treatment of cells with forskolin, isobutylmethyl xanthine (IBMX) or LY294002 inhibited the formation of spacing whereas H89 or Y27632 showed little effect. When these cells were treated with 0.06% trypsin after culture, most cells detached from the dishes as cells cultured in HS alone did. However, cells treated with IBMX exhibited weaker adhesivity than HS alone. Based on these observations, it is suggested that HS treatment might decrease the adhesivity and induce three-dimensional migration of hADSCs, in the latter of which cAMP signaling could be involved.
