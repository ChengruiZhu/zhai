For neurons to function properly, they must establish and then maintain their unique, subtype-specific gene expression profiles. These unique gene expression profiles are established during development by networks of DNA–binding proteins, termed transcription factors (TFs). However, how neurons maintain their unique gene expression profiles in the mature and aging brain is largely unknown. Recent advances in inducible genetic technologies now allow us to manipulate gene expression in adult neurons, after normal development. Applying such techniques, we examined the effect of knocking down TF expression in two adult neuronal subtypes. We show that the TF networks that establish unique gene expression profiles during development are then required to maintain them thereafter. Thus, gene expression profiles are not simply “locked-in,” but must be actively maintained by persistent developmental TF networks. However, we found that critical cross-regulatory relationships that had existed between TFs during development were not present in the adult, even between persisting TFs. This highlights important differences between developmental and maintenance transcriptional networks in individual neurons. The dependence of subtype gene expression on active mechanisms represents a potential Achilles heel for long-lived cells, as deterioration of those active mechanisms could lead to functional degeneration of neurons with advancing age.
