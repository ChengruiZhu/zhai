We aimed to investigate the influence of long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) PTEN pseudogene-1 (PTENP1) on the proliferation, migration and cycle of breast cancer cells and its mechanism. Lentiviral vectors expressing PTENP1 were synthesized and breast cancer cells MCF7 were transfected with LV003-GFP-PTENP1 and LV003-GFP, respectively. The proliferation capacities of breast cancer cells were detected using CCK-8 assay, and the migration capacities of breast cancer cells were detected using scratch assay; flow cytometry was used to detect the cell cycles and Western blot was used to detect the expression levels of cyclin A2, CDK2, p-p44/42 MAPK, t-p44/42 MAPK, p-p38 MAPK, t-p38 MAPK, p-AKT, t-AKT in AKT and MAPK pathways. The absorbance values (A450) of cells in experimental group at 48 and 72 h were 1.4±0.3 and 2.3±0.47, respectively, which were significantly lower than those in control group (3.2±0.39, 3.4±0.58) (P<0.05). The number of cell colonies in experimental group was (48±13), which was significantly lower than that in control group (159±16) (P<0.01). The cell migration rate in experimental group was 22.8±3.3%, which was significantly lower than that in control group 61.8±5.2% (P<0.01). Western blot detection showed that the expression levels of cyclin A2, CDK2, p-AKT, p-p44/42 MAPK and p-p38 MAPK in experimental group were significantly decreased compared with those in control group. LncRNA PTENP1 can inhibit the proliferation and migration of breast cancer cells via the AKT and MAPK signaling pathways.
