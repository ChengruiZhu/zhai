Theories of rational behavior are built on a number of principles, including the assumption that subjects adjust their behavior to maximize their long-term returns and that they should work equally hard to obtain a reward in situations where the effort to obtain reward is the same (called the invariance principle). Humans, however, are sensitive to the manner in which equivalent choices are presented, or “framed,” and often have a greater tendency to continue an endeavor once an investment in money, effort, or time has been made, a phenomenon known as “sunk cost” effect. In a similar manner, when monkeys must perform different numbers of trials to obtain a reward, they work harder as the number of trials already performed increases, even though both the work remaining and the forthcoming reward are the same in all situations. Methods from the theory of Reinforcement Learning, which usually provide learning strategies aimed at maximizing returns, cannot model this violation of invariance. Here we generalize a prominent method of Reinforcement Learning so as to explain the violation of invariance, without losing the ability to model behaviors explained by standard Reinforcement Learning models. This generalization extends our understanding of how animals and humans learn and behave.
