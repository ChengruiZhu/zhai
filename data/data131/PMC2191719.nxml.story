Upon primary challenge with lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV), H-2d (BALB/cByJ) mice mount a cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) response to a single immunodominant domain of the viral nucleoprotein (NP) but no detectable response to the viral glycoprotein (GP). To manipulate this CTL response, the viral NP gene was expressed in the thymus and peripheral T lymphocytes using the murine Thy1.2 promoter. As a result, such Thy1.2-NP (H-2d) transgenic (tg) mice deleted their high-affinity anti-LCMV-NP CTL, but generated equal numbers of lower-affinity NP CTL. Further, they made an alternative anti-LCMV-GP CTL response that is not normally found in non-tg mice indicating a hierarchial control of the CTL response. Unlike the H-2d mice, H-2b (C57Bl/6J) mice normally mount a CTL response to both LCMV-GP and -NP. When the LCMV-NP was expressed using the Thy1.2 promoter in these H-2b mice, the LCMV-NP-specific CTL response was completely aborted and no CTL to new, alternative viral epitopes were generated. Dilutions of H-2b or H-2d NP peptides indicated that 3-4 logs less H-2b NP peptide was required to sensitize syngeneic target cells for CTL-specific lysis, suggesting that the differing affinities of H-2b and H-2d major histocompatibility complex molecules for their peptides likely account for the total removal of NP CTL in the H-2b mice but only partial removal in H-2d mice made to express thymic NP. Thymic grafting experiments done with thymi from newborn Thy1.2-NP tg mice show that selection processes studied in this model are of central (thymic) origin and are not caused by Thy1.2- positive LCMV-NP-expressing T lymphocytes in the periphery.
