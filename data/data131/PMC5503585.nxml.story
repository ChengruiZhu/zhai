) associated with serum triglycerides, HDL-cholesterol, or LDL-cholesterol, respectively, with 13, 16, or 9 of these loci having previously been associated with triglyceride-, HDL-cholesterol–, or LDL-cholesterol–related traits, respectively. Two single nucleotide polymorphisms (rs10790162, rs7350481) were significantly related to both serum triglycerides and hypertriglyceridemia; three polymorphisms (rs146515657, rs147317864, rs12229654) were significantly related to both serum HDL-cholesterol and hypo–HDL-cholesterolemia; and six polymorphisms (rs2853969, rs7771335, rs2071653, rs2269704, rs2269703, rs2269702) were significantly related to both serum LDL-cholesterol and hyper–LDL-cholesterolemia. Among polymorphisms identified in the present study, two polymorphisms (rs146515657, rs147317864) may be novel determinants of hypo–HDL-cholesterolemia, and six polymorphisms (rs2853969, rs7771335, rs2071653, rs2269704, rs2269703, rs2269702) may be new determinants of hyper–LDL-cholesterolemia. In addition, 12, 61, 23, or 3 polymorphisms may be new determinants of the serum triglyceride, HDL-cholesterol, or LDL-cholesterol concentrations or of hyper–LDL-cholesterolemia, respectively.
