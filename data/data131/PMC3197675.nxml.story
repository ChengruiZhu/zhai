Chemical genetics uses small molecules to perturb biological systems to study gene function. By analogy with genetic lesions, chemical probes act as fast-acting, reversible, and “tunable” conditional alleles. Furthermore, small molecules can target multiple protein targets and target pathways simultaneously to uncover phenotypes that may be masked by genes encoding partially redundant proteins. Finally, potent chemical probes can be useful starting points for the development of human therapeutics. Here, we used cantharidin, a natural toxin, to uncover otherwise “hidden” phenotypes for a methyltransferase that has resisted characterization. This enzyme, Crg1, has no phenotype in standard conditions but is indispensible for survival in the presence of cantharidin. Using this chemical genetic relationship, we characterized novel functions of Crg1, and by combining diverse genomic assays with small molecule perturbation we characterized the mechanism of cantharidin cytotoxicity. These observations are relevant beyond yeast Crg1 because cantharidin and its analogues have potent anticancer activity, yet its therapeutic use has been limited to topical applications because of its cytotoxicity. Considering that methyltransferases are an extremely abundant and diverse class of cellular proteins, chemical probes such as cantharidin are critical for understanding their cellular roles and defining potential points of therapeutic intervention.
