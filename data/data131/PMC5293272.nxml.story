A critical event in mammalian embryo development is construction of a mass of embryonic stem cells surrounded by a distinct shell that later forms the placenta along with other structures. Despite sustained investigation, multiple hypotheses for what is responsible for this organization persist and it remains unclear what is responsible for the robust organization (remarkable ability for embryos to pattern correctly) of these structures. Here, we utilize multi-scale, stochastic modeling along with fluorescence imaging to investigate the factors that contribute to the incredible robustness of this organizational process. Results point to two factors that contribute to this robustness: 1) the timing and pace of cell fate specification and 2) stochastic gene regulatory effects. The former creates a window of time during which each cell can continually read their environment and adjust their gene expressions (and consequently fate) in response to dynamic rearrangements of cells arising from cell divisions and motions. The latter improves cell plasticity, providing the capability for cells to adjust to changes in their local environment. Fluorescence imaging results demonstrate that the magnitude and structure of gene expression variations match those predicted to promote organizational robustness.
