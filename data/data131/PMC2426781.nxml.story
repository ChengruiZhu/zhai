Microarrays have received significant attention in recent years as scientists have firstly identified factors that can produce reduced confidence in gene expression data obtained on these platforms, and secondly sought to establish laboratory practices and a set of standards by which data are reported with integrity. Microsphere-based assays represent a new generation of diagnostics in this field capable of providing substantial quantitative and qualitative information from gene expression profiling. However, for gene expression profiling, this type of platform is still in the demonstration phase, with issues arising from comparative studies in the literature not yet identified. It is desirable to identify potential parameters that are established as important in controlling the information derived from microsphere-based hybridizations to quantify gene expression. As these evolve, a standard set of parameters will be established that are required to be provided when data are submitted for publication. Here we initiate this process by identifying a number of parameters we have found to be important in microsphere-based assays designed for the quantification of low abundant genes which are variable between studies.
