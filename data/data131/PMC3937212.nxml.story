Using the fruitfly as an experimental model system, we produced chromosomes that were broken at one end, and thus lacked the normal telomeric cap. The occurrence of such chromosomes is thought to promote carcinogenesis. A cell's response to such chromosomes is therefore of great interest. In somatic cells the tumor suppressors Chk2 and P53 can induce suicide of cells with such a chromosome and eliminate the danger. In the male germline, though, such chromosomes can be healed by the addition of a new telomere cap, and may then be transmitted to the next generation. We find that Chk2 and P53 regulate healing in the germline, but in seemingly opposite directions. Chk2 functions independently of P53 to eliminate cells with a damaged chromosome, while P53 is required to repopulate the germline after this Chk2-mediated elimination. Cells that carry a broken chromosome continue to divide in Chk2 mutants. We observed that the broken ends of sister chromatids may fuse in meiosis and that the fused chromatids produce a bridge spanning two cells at the second meiotic division. This structure elicits a previously undiscovered mechanism to eliminate sperm derived from such cells, providing an added safeguard to maintain genome integrity through the germline.
