We identified 2,066 patients aged 10-16 years who underwent CR following a primary anterior shoulder dislocation, of which, 1,937 met the exclusion criteria. The median age was 15.0 years and 79.7% were male. The IDR was 20.1 per 100,000 person-years, and was highest among 16 year-old males (164.4 per 100,000 person-years). In contrast, primary anterior shoulder dislocation was rare among patients aged 10-12 years [5.9% (N=115) of all primary dislocations]. Repeat shoulder CR was observed in 740 patients (38.2%) after a median of 0.8 years. The overall cumulative incidence of repeat shoulder CR at six-months, one-year, two-years, and five-years was 13.0%, 21.3%, 29.2%, and 36.2%, respectively; however, the cumulative incidence by age (Figure 1) revealed the rate of repeat shoulder CR to be highest among 14-16 year-olds (37.2-42.3%), and considerably less among patients aged 10-13 years (0-25.0%). Male sex (HR 1.2, p=0.04; interpreted as a 20% increased risk for males as compared to females) and patient age (HR 1.2, p<0.001; interpreted as a 20% increased risk for each year over age 10) significantly influenced the risk of a repeat shoulder CR. Overall, 31.2% (N=604) of patients underwent shoulder stabilization, of which, half underwent surgery following the index shoulder CR (49.9%, N=369).
