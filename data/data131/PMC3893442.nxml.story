Blast-induced neurotrauma (BINT) is the signature life threatening injury of current military casualties. Neuroinflammation is a key pathological occurrence of secondary injury contributing to brain damage after blast injury. We have recently demonstrated that blast-triggered complement activation and cytokine release are associated with BINT. Here, we evaluated if administration of the complement inhibitor recombinant human decay-accelerating factor (rhDAF) is beneficial on neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration in a rat model of moderate BINT. Administration of rhDAF after exposure to moderate blast overpressure (BOP, 120 kPa) mitigated brain injury characterized by neuronal degeneration. rhDAF treatment reduced complement hemolytic activity at 3 hours and tissue complement deposition at 3, 24, and 48 hours as well as systemic and local cytokine release at 24 hours post BOP. Furthermore, rhDAF protected blood–brain barrier (BBB) integrity and reduced cytotoxic edema. Interaction between complement cleavage component, C3a and C3a receptor and tau phosphorylation were also attenuated in rhDAF treated animals at 3 and 24 hours after BOP. These novel findings suggest early complement targeted inhibition as a new therapeutic strategy to decrease neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration after blast TBI.
