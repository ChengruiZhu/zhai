For the anterior tibial loading condition, debridement of the indirect insertion increased tibial translation by 0.37±0.24 mm at 0º (P<.01) and by 0.16±0.19 mm at 15º (P<.05; increases were < 1 mm in all specimens). ACL deficiency increased ATT in response to an anterior tibial load (P<.0001) with maximum effect at 15º (11.26±1.15 mm vs. ACL intact; 11.04±1.08 mm vs. indirect insertion debridement). For the combined rotatory loading condition, debridement increased tibial translation by 0.17±0.11 mm at 0º (P<.01; increases were < 0.3 mm in all specimens) with no effect at other flexion angles. ACL deficiency increased ATT in response to a combined rotatory load (P<.01) with maximum effect at 15º (4.45±0.85 mm vs. ACL intact; 4.44±0.84 mm vs. indirect insertion debridement). The contribution of the indirect insertion to restraining ATT in response to an anterior tibial load or a combined rotatory load was ≤ 5.5% in all specimens, at all flexion angles. During the simulated pivot shift, posterior tibial translation (12.79±3.22 mm) and external tibial rotation (17.60±4.30º) were greater in the ACL deficient condition (P<.0001) compared with the ACL intact (1.29±1.34 mm and 1.54±1.61º) and indirect insertion debridement conditions (1.28±1.34 mm and 1.54±1.47º). Posterior translation and external tibial rotation were not significantly different between the ACL intact and debridement conditions (P=.68, P=.99).
