There were 30 patients in the study. Average age was 57 (SD = 16) and most 19 (63%) were male, Caucasian 22 (73%) and were admitted from the community or home 18 (60%). The most frequent comorbidities were diabetes 13 (43%), heart disease 12 (40%) and chronic pulmonary disease 10 (33%). Previous medical history within 90 days included 15 (50%) hospitalizations, 13 (43%) infections, 6 (20%) Intensive Care Unit stays and 7 (23%) surgeries. All patients received a GN antimicrobial within 30 days prior to C/T. Ninety-three percent of infections were due to PSA and 17 (57%) were polymicrobial. All but 4 patients had multidrug-resistant PSA. The most frequent source of infection (some multiple sources) was respiratory 20 (67%), cUTI 8(27%) and sepsis 5 (17%). Empiric C/T therapy was given to 7 (23%) patients. One patient required escalation of therapy after C/T. Average duration of C/T was 10 (SD = 5.4) days. 23 (77%) patients were discharged within 30 days of last dose of therapy. Microbiological eradication was documented for 12 patients. There were 5 (17%) readmissions, but none associated with a GN infection. Six patients died (1 bilateral stroke, 1 cancer, 2 septic shock, 1 pneumonia and 1 complications of burn).
