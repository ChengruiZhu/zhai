Neurons communicate with each other via specialized cell–cell junctions called synapses. The proper formation of synapses (“synaptogenesis”) is crucial to the development of the nervous system, but the molecular pathways that regulate this process are not fully understood. External cues, such as brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), trigger synaptogenesis by promoting the formation of axonal filopodia, thin extensions projecting outward from a growing axon. Filopodia are formed by elongation of actin filaments, a process that is regulated by a complex set of actin-binding proteins. Here, we reveal a novel molecular circuit underlying BDNF-stimulated filopodia formation through the regulated inhibition of actin-capping factor activity. We show that the actin-capping protein Eps8 down-regulates axonal filopodia formation in neurons in the absence of neurotrophic factors. In contrast, in the presence of BDNF, the kinase MAPK becomes activated and phosphorylates Eps8, leading to inhibition of its actin-capping function and stimulation of filopodia formation. Our study, therefore, identifies actin-capping factor inhibition as a critical step in axonal filopodia formation and likely in new synapse formation.
