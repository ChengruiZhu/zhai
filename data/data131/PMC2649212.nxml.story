One of the ultimate goals of genomics is to explore structural and functional variations of all genes in a genome. High-density oligo-microarray techniques enable prediction of genome-wide gene expression and genome-wide genetic polymorphisms from using RNA and genomic DNA samples, respectively. A recent proposal to integrate the two predictions by use of RNA microarray data alone has great practical implications in genomics. However, it is essential but very challenging to develop an appropriate analytical method for detecting genetic polymorphisms (SFPs) from RNA expression data, which are inherently coupled with various sources of biological and technical variations. This paper presents a novel statistical approach to detect SFPs from gene expression data. We demonstrated that the new method is significantly more robust to variation due to differential expression of genes and improves the reliability of calling SFPs that bear genuine sequence polymorphisms than the other five methods in the mainstream literature on SFP prediction from microarray data. The improved predictability of detecting SFPs not only confers accuracy in evaluating gene expression from microarray information, but also opens up an opportunity to integrate structural and functional analyses by using only one set of microarray data.
