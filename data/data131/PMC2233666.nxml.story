The modular organization of cells is not immediately obvious from the network of interacting genes, proteins, and molecules. A new window into cellular modularity is opened up by genetic data that identifies pairs of genes that interact either directly or indirectly to provide robustness to cellular function. Such pairs can map out the modular nature of a network if we understand how they relate to established mathematical clustering methods applied to networks to identify putative modules. We can test the relationship between genetically interacting pairs and modules on artificial data: large networks of interacting proteins and molecules that were evolved within an artificial chemistry and genetics, and that pass the standard tests for biological networks. Modularity evolves in these networks in order to deal with a multitude of functional goals, with a degree depending on environmental variability. Relationships between genetically interacting pairs and modules similar to those displayed by the artificial gene networks are found in the proteinâ€“protein interaction network of baker's yeast. The evolution of complex functional biological networks in silico provides an opportunity to develop and test new methods and tools to understand the complexity of biological systems at the network level.
