-imidazoledimethylsulphoxidetetrachloro-ruthenate (NAMI-A), are studied in vitro in models mimicking the angiogenic process. The ruthenium compounds reduced the production and the release of nitrosyls from either healthy macrophages and immortalized EA.hy926 endothelial cells. The effects of NAMI-A are qualitatively similar and sometimes quantitatively superior to those of RuEDTA and KP1339. NAMI-A reduces the production and release of nitric oxide (NO) by the EA.hy926 endothelial cells and correspondingly inhibits their invasive ability; it also strongly inhibits the angiogenesis in matrigel sponges implanted subcutaneously in healthy mice. Taken together, these data support the anti-angiogenic activity of the tested ruthenium compounds and they contribute to explain the selective activity of NAMI-A against solid tumour metastases, the tumour compartment on which angiogenesis is strongly involved. This anti-angiogenic effect may also contribute to the inhibition of the release of metastatic cells from the primary tumour. Investigations on the anti-angiogenic effects of NAMI-A at this level will increase knowledge of its pharmacological properties and it will give a further impulse to the development of this class of innovative metal-based drugs.
