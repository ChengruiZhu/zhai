With repeated exposure to a perturbation, the sensorimotor system learns to develop an adaptive response that is highly specific to both the amplitude and temporal structure of that perturbation in order to effectively counteract it. It is widely known that the amplitude of the adaptive response starts small and gradually grows to the right size with repeated exposure. However, it is also the case that the temporal structure of the adaptive response starts somewhat generically and gradually grows into the right shape with repeated exposure. A key question is whether the adaptive response to a perturbation begins with a stereotyped temporal structure that only becomes specified with further practice, or if it begins with a degree of specificity for the experienced perturbation that need only to be refined by practice. Here, by precisely measuring the temporal pattern of motor output in the single-trial adaptive response to two different perturbations, we show that the initial adaptive response is indeed specific to the temporal characteristics of the perturbation, even when the disturbance randomly changed from one trial to the next. These results demonstrate that the sensorimotor system is sensitive to the temporal features of a disturbance, even when experienced just once.
