Neurons in the brain respond to (sensory) stimuli by generating electrical pulses called ‘spikes’ or ‘action potentials’. Spikes are organized in different temporal patterns, such as ‘bursts’ in which they occur at a high frequency followed by a period of silence. Bursts are ubiquitous in the nervous system: they occur in different parts of the brain and in different species. Different mechanisms that generate them have been pointed out. Why the nervous system uses bursts in its communication, or what type of information is represented by bursts, remains largely unknown. Here, we looked at bursting in thalamocortical relay (TCR) cells, neurons that form a bridge between early sensory processing and higher-order structures (cortex). These cells fire bursts as a result of the activation of two distinct subthreshold ionic currents: the T-type calcium current and the h-type current. We investigated experimentally and computationally what features in the input makes TCR cells respond with bursts, and what features with single spikes. Bursts are a response to low-frequency slowly increasing input; single spikes are a response to faster fluctuations. Moreover, bursts are rare and highly informative, in line with an earlier hypothesis that bursts could play a ‘wake-up call’ role in the nervous system.
