All 7 patients were Chinese women, with a mean age of 42 years (38–46). All the patients had severe anemia (Hb level < 6 g/dl) caused by primary menorrhagia due to uterine myoma (n = 5) or end-stage renal disease (n = 2) and severe anemia persisted for a average period of 4 months (2–6). Each patient received packed red blood cells transfusion (average: 1580 ml) over a period of 2–5 days. Blood transfusion increased the hemoglobin level by at least 4.5 g/dL from baseline. The neurological symptoms appeared a mean of 6.3 days (2–13) after the last blood transfusion. Headache was the most frequent symptom and seizure, transient or persistent neurological disorders were observed. Neuroimaging showed cortical subarachnoid hemorrhage (n = 2), focal intracerebral hemorrhage (n = 2), localized brain edema (n = 3), cerebral infarction (n = 1), and posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (n = 2). Cerebral vasoconstrictions were demonstrated by magnetic resonance angiography or cerebral angiography. Arterial constriction reversed in all patients within 1 to 3 months of follow-up after disease onset and no relapse was observed up to a mean of 17.1 ± 4.8 months of follow-up.
