 was sequenced in 1996, a major objective has been to characterize its 6,200 genes. Important contributions to this have been made using high-throughput screens. These have provided a vast quantity of information, but many genes remain minimally characterized, and the high-throughput data are necessarily superficial and not always reliable. We aimed to bridge the gap between the high-throughput data and detailed experimental analysis. Specifically, we have developed a strategy of combining different sources of high-throughput data to predict minimally characterized genes that might be implicated in DNA processing. From this we have gone on to test the involvement of these genes in meiosis using detailed experimental analysis. In a sense, we have turned high-throughput analysis on its head and used it to return to low-throughput experimental analysis. Using this strategy we have obtained evidence that 16 out of 81 genes selected (20%) are indeed involved in DNA processing and 13 of these genes (16%) are involved in meiotic DNA processing. Our selection strategy demonstrates that different sources of high-throughput data can successfully be combined to predict gene function. Thus, we have used detailed experimental analysis to validate the predictions of high-throughput analysis.
