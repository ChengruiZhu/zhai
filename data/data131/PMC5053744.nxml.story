Esophageal cancer is one of the most common cancers worldwide, and the incidence and mortality is increasing rapidly in recent years in China, but the underlying mechanisms are largely unclear. Herein we found that the expression of PRSS8, a serine protease prostasin, is significantly decreased in esophageal squamous cell carcinomas (ESCC) at mRNA and protein levels. The reduction of PRSS8 was well correlated with poor differentiation and shorter survival time. Interestingly, ESCC stromal expression of PRSS8 was significantly correlated with stromal lymphocyte infiltration and cancer progression. Methylation specific PCR showed that PRSS8 was hypermethylated in ESCC tissues and ESCC cell lines, which was linked to the downregulation of PRSS8 expression and decreased activities of PRSS8 promoter. De-methylation agent decitabine was able to restore PRSS8 expression, leading to the inhibition of cancer cell proliferation, motility, migration and cell cycle arrest. However, the restored PRSS8 and its tumor inhibition could be reversed by small interfering RNA targeting PRSS8. Mechanistic study showed that tumor inhibition of PRSS8 may be associated with proliferation- and epithelial mesenchymal transition - related proteins in ESCC cells. In conclusion, our finding showed that PRSS8 methylation and its stromal expression had important clinical significance in ESCC.
