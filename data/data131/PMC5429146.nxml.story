Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) has become a public health burden all over the world. A significant percentage of the patients with NAFLD have a co-existing metabolic syndrome that is a risk factor for cardiovascular disease. Clinical as well as epidemiological research shows that NAFLD is not simply related to liver-related morbidity and mortality but is also associated with an elevated risk of coronary heart disease (CHD), irregularities of cardiac function as well as cardiac structure, valvular heart disease, and arrhythmias. Animal studies suggest that NAFLD by itself exacerbates systemic/hepatic insulin resistance, leads to atherogenic dyslipidemia and generates a number of pro-inflammatory, pro-coagulant and profibrogenic mediators which play an essential role in the pathophysiology of cardiac abnormalities including arrhythmias. Hence, it is suggested that the patients with NAFLD may derive benefit from intensive monitoring and treatment methods to reduce the risk of CHD along with other cardiac/arrhythmic complications. The intent of this clinical review is to sum up the quickly increasing body of evidence that provides support for a robust relationship between NAFLD and cardiac arrhythmias and to present the putative biological mechanisms underlying this correlation.
