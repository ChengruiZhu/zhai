We describe a new approach to statistical learning for sequence data that is broadly applicable to computational biology problems and that has experimentally demonstrated advantages over current hidden Markov model (HMM)-based methods for sequence analysis. The methods we describe in this paper, implemented in the CRAIG program, allow researchers to modularly specify and train sequence analysis models that combine a wide range of weakly informative features into globally optimal predictions. Our results for the gene prediction problem show significant improvements over existing ab initio gene predictors on a variety of tests, including the specially challenging ENCODE regions. Such improved predictions, particularly on initial and single exons, could benefit researchers who are seeking more accurate means of recognizing such important features as signal peptides and regulatory regions. More generally, we believe that our method, by combining the structure-describing capabilities of HMMs with the accuracy of margin-based classification methods, provides a general tool for statistical learning in biological sequences that will replace HMMs in any sequence modeling task for which there is annotated training data.
