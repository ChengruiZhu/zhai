Resistant hypertension, defined as failure to achieve target blood pressure
                    despite the use of optimal or maximum doses of at least 3 agents, one of which
                    is a diuretic, or requiring 4 or more medications to achieve blood pressure
                    goal, is likely to affect up to 20% of all patients with hypertension.
                    Apparent resistant hypertension may be caused by medication nonadherence,
                    substances that either interfere with antihypertensive mediations or cause blood
                    pressure elevation, and under- or inappropriate medication treatment. Certain
                    patient characteristics are associated with the presence of resistant
                    hypertension and include chronic kidney disease, diabetes, obesity, and presence
                    of end-organ damage (microalbuminuria, retinopathy, left-ventricular
                    hypertrophy). Secondary causes of resistant hypertension are not uncommon and
                    include obstructive sleep apnea, chronic kidney disease, primary aldosteronism,
                    renal artery stenosis, pheochromocytoma, and Cushingâ€™s disease. Initial
                    medication management usually includes adding or increasing the dose of a
                    diuretic, which is effective in lowering the blood pressure of a large number of
                    patients with resistant hypertension. Additional management options include
                    maximizing lifestyle modification, combination therapy of antihypertensive
                    agents depending on individual patient characteristics, adding less-commonly
                    used fourth- or fifth-line antihypertensive agents, and referral to a
                    hypertension specialist.
