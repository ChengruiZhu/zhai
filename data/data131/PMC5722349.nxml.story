We acquired 4DCT images of cylindrical phantoms under repetitive motion induced by a translation platform. Acquisition settings varied with respect to temporal spacing, gantry rotation speed, and motion period of the phantoms. Reconstructed images were sorted into 10 phase bins and were compared to static phantom images acquired at corresponding positions of the respiration phase. Acquisitions with different temporal spacing did not play a significant role in the amount of motion observed in full‐cycle maximum intensity projection images. Target delineation accuracy at end‐of‐inhalation phase was observed to be constant up to a threshold in the value of the reconstruction interval, beyond which it varied arbitrarily. This threshold was found to be correlated with the number of phase bins and the motion period. No observable variations were noted with images from the end of exhalation when temporal spacing was varied. Target delineation accuracy was observed to be enhanced in acquisitions using faster gantry rotation speeds. An evaluation of the acquisition parameters needs to be performed depending on the period of the motion and limiting factors such as the availability of acquisition settings, X‐ray tube workload, image storage, and processing power.
