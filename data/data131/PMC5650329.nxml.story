Scholars are striving to apply molecular biology involving long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) in the prognostication of papillary thyroid cancer (PTC). However, the clinical role of lncRNAs in the prognostic setting of PTC is still unclear. Herein, a comprehensive inquiry was performed to screen lncRNA expression profiling with 507 PTC patients from The Cancer Genome Atlas RNA-sequencing datasets. A total of 734 lncRNAs were detected to be aberrantly expressed, among which three novel lncRNAs including AC079630.2, CRNDE and CTD-2171N6.1 were markedly related to the progression and survival of PTC. Furthermore, the aberrant expression of these lncRNAs could be verified by other cohorts from gene expression omnibus (GEO) as detected by microarrays. Next, we established a three-lncRNA signature and divided the PTC patients into two subgroups of high- and low-risk. Interestingly, patients with high-risk tended to gain obviously poorer outcome. Most importantly, this three-lncRNA signature was an independent biomarker to predict the patient survival of PTC. The accurate molecular roles of these three lncRNAs remains unclarified and warrants further characterization, but our current data propose that they might play pivotal roles in PTC tumorigenesis and more importantly, these novel lncRNAs are closely related to patientsâ€™ survival. These discoveries will have far-reaching consequences with respect to molecular prediction of PTC.
