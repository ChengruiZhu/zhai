Before each cell division, cells must accurately duplicate their chromosomes. It is critical that cells coordinate the replication of DNA with the packaging of DNA into chromosomes to insure that all genetic and epigenetic information is accurately transmitted to the next generation. In eukaryotes, replication starts at multiple sites, called “replication origins,” which are distributed throughout the genome and initiate replication in a strict order to maintain genomic stability and prevent cancer. Previous studies looked at the effect of chemical modifications on histone proteins, which affect chromosome packaging, on replication but no particular histone modifications distinctly associated with replication start sites. Here, we took advantage of recent advances in whole genome sequencing to map replication origins and histone modifications for the entire DNA in human cancer cells. One of the histone modifications we tested, methylation of lysine 79 on histone H3, was remarkably enriched at a group of replication origins. Inhibiting the enzyme that catalyzes this histone modification caused some DNA to replicate more than once during a single cell cycle, suggesting that methylation of histone H3 on lysine 79 might play an important role in controlling DNA replication.
