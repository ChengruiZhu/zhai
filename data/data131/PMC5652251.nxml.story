 were used to quantify the expression of tumoral CAIX (tCAIX) and stromal CAIX (sCAIX) and tumoral Ki-67 for each TMA core. Hazard ratios for DSS were calculated using Cox proportional hazards analysis. High tCAIX and sCAIX expression levels were associated with reduced DSS (aHR=1.003, 95% CI:1.00–1.01 and aHR=1.010, 95% CI:1.001–1.019, per AQUA score unit, respectively). Ki-67 expression was not associated with survival (aHR=1.01, 95% CI:0.99–1.02) in the FHCRC cohort. DSS for patients with high sCAIX and low Ki-67 did not differ from that of other patient groups. Elevated tCAIX was associated with reduced DSS as a continuous and as a dichotomized (75%) variable. sCAIX was associated with DSS as a continuous variable but not when dichotomized (75%). However, the previously proposed ‘functional hypoxia’ signature was not replicated in the current FHCRC study. The failure to replicate our prior observation of poorer survival in patients with combined high sCAIX and low tumoral Ki-67 was likely due to the absence of an association between tumoral Ki-67 and DSS in this cohort. However, the association between DSS and tCAIX and sCAIX supports a role for CAIX in OSCC clinical outcomes.
