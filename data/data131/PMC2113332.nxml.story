Epidermal growth factor (EGF), circulating in the blood, is taken up by rat liver hepatocytes by means of specific and saturable receptor- mediated endocytosis. These experiments were undertaken to determine (a) the transport pathway(s) of EGF taken up by rat liver and (b) the effects of lysosomal inhibition on its transport. 125I-EGF was injected into rat portal veins, and bile samples were collected and analyzed for both total and immunoprecipitable radioactivity. In addition, the livers were examined by electron microscopic autoradiography. Some animals received injections of chloroquine before surgery, to disrupt lysosomal function. The results indicate that most of the EGF taken up by the hepatocytes is transported to lysosomes and degraded. However, a small but significant percentage of endocytosed EGF is transported by a pathway independent of the lysosomal system, resulting in secretion of intact EGF: (a) Both degraded and immunoprecipitable EGF are secreted into bile. (b) Immunoprecipitable radioactivity peaks at 20 min after EGF injection, whereas degradation-associated radioactivity does not peak until 40 min postinjection. (c) EGF isolated from bile is specifically taken up by isolated hepatocytes in monolayer culture, indicating that it is still recognizable by the EGF receptor. (d) When the lysosomal system is inhibited with chloroquine, secretion of degraded EGF is significantly inhibited, whereas the amount of intact EGF secreted into bile is unchanged. The utilization by liver of a dual transport process for EGF represents an unusual system of intracellular ligand processing, whose physiological significance has yet to be determined.
