Colorectal cancer remains one of the major cancer- related deaths despite progress in the treatment during past decades. Detection of disease at earlier stages reduces its mortality. The aim of current study was to investigate expression of Cytokeratin 19 (CK19), Cytokeratin 20 (CK20) and Guanylyl Cyclase C (GCC) mRNA in peripheral blood of non- metastatic colorectal cancer patients which may result into introducing of an early detection test. 25 patients with colorectal cancer and 25 healthy controls were recruited. Blood was obtained from all individuals. Expression of CK19 and CK20 and GCC mRNA and 18SrRNA (as reference gene) were determined based on real- time RT-PCR on total RNA from blood. CK19, CK20 and GCC expression had been detected in 68%, 76% & 52% of patient group, respectively, which was higher than healthy group, with 8%, 32% and 0% expression, respectively (p<0.05). CK20 was over-expressed 8- fold more in patients compared to controls. Similar result was found for CK19 with 4- fold over- expression. Sensitivity and specificity of combination of markers were 88% and 68%, respectively. Current data suggest that the detection of CK20 & CK19 as relative sensitive markers may become a valuable tool for primary diagnosis of colorectal cancer in early stages. GCC could be considered as a specific tumor marker for detection of colorectal cancer. Higher expression of these markers in patients may be considered as a relative good tool for the diagnosis of disease in non- metastatic stages.
