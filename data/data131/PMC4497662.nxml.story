Kinases are important regulators in many cellular signaling processes. They bind to and phosphorylate different substrates to affect distinct signaling events. Usually, a kinase releases its substrate quickly after phosphorylation to ensure fast signaling. However, we find that this is not always true for the prototypical cAMP-dependent protein kinase PKA. PKA activity is inhibited by binding regulatory subunits, some of which are themselves PKA substrates. We show that type II regulatory subunits, such as RIIβ, are phosphorylated but do not release the kinase. These holoenzyme complexes consisting of PKA catalytic subunits and type II regulatory subunits are product traps. cAMP can bind this holoenzyme, facilitating the dissociation of the complex and unleashing PKA activity. We show that this dissociation event is modulatable by different divalent metal ions (magnesium and calcium). Since PKA is tethered to and regulates calcium channels, we propose a new link between cAMP and calcium signaling pathways—two of the major signaling molecules in the cell. We also found that this inhibitory phosphorylation event impacts the reassociation of PKA complexes. Thus, for fast and tight regulation of PKA, other signaling enzymes, such as phosphatases, are needed to remove this modification.
