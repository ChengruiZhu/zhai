The origin of fibrotic cells within connective tissue is unclear. For example, the extent to which microvascular pericytes contribute to the number of myofibroblasts present in dermal fibrosis in uncertain. Connective tissue growth factor (CTGF/CCN2) is a marker and mediator of fibrosis. In this report, we use an antibody recognizing CCN2 to assess the cell types in mouse dermis which express CCN2 in the bleomycin model of skin scleroderma. Control (PBS injected) and fibrotic (bleomycin-injected) dermis was examined for CCN2, α-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA) (to detect myofibroblasts), and NG2 (to detect pericytes) expression. Consistent with previously published data, CCN2 expression was largely absent in the dermis of control mice. However, upon exposure to bleomycin, CCN2 was observed in the dermis. Cells that expressed CCN2 were α−SMA-expressing myofibroblasts. Approximately 85% of myofibroblasts were NG2-positive, CCN2-expressing pericytes, indicating that pericytes significantly contributed to the presence of myofibroblasts in sclerotic dermis. Thus CCN2 is induced in fibrotic skin, correlating with the induction of myofibroblast induction. Moreover, CCN2-expressing pericytes significantly contribute to the appearance of myofibroblasts in bleomycin-induced skin scleroderma.
