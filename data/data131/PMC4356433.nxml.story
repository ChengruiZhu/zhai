 aggravates hypertrophy, but protects against adverse cardiac remodeling induced by pressure overload. Cardiac hypertrophy was induced by left ventricular pressure overload in male mice subjected to transverse aortic constriction (TAC). The mice were randomly selected to receive a tail vein injection of either miR-455 or green fluorescent protein per animal at 1, 8, 15 and 21 days following surgery. Cardiac hypertrophy, function and remodeling were evaluated by echocardiography, catheterization, histological analysis and the examination of the expression of specific genes and cardiac apoptosis. TAC (2 weeks following surgery) resulted in significant cardiac hypertrophy, which was significantly aggravated by treatment with miR-455. However, miR-455 replacement therapy markedly reduced myocardial fibrosis and inhibited apoptosis, suggesting that this therapy can prevent maladaptive ventricular remodeling. miR-455 was also identified and validated to target calreticulin, a protein that is critical for cardiac development. The restoration of miR-455 gene expression may thus be a potential therapeutic strategy to reverse pressure-induced cardiac hypertrophy and prevent maladaptive cardiac remodeling through the regulation of miR-455 at different time points following hypertrophy.
