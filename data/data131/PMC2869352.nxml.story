The lamin A rod domain mutants G232E, Q294P and R386K are either diffusely distributed or form large aggregates in the nucleoplasm, resulting in aberrant nuclear morphology in various cell types. We examined the effects of these lamin mutants on the distribution of heterochromatin protein 1 (HP1) isoforms. HeLa cells expressing these mutants showed a heterogeneous pattern of HP1α and β depletion but without altering HP1γ levels. Changes in HP1α and β were not observed in cells expressing wild-type lamin A or mutant R482L, which assembled normally at the nuclear rim. Treatment with proteasomal inhibitors led to restoration of levels of HP1 isoforms and also resulted in stable association of lamin mutants with the nuclear periphery, rim localization of the inner nuclear membrane lamin-binding protein emerin and partial improvement of nuclear morphology. A comparison of the stability of HP1 isoforms indicated that HP1α and β displayed increased turnover and higher basal levels of ubiquitination than HP1γ. Transcript analysis of components of the ubiquitination pathway showed that a specific F-box protein, FBXW10 was induced several-fold in cells expressing lamin mutants. Importantly, ectopic expression of FBXW10 in HeLa cells led to depletion of HP1α and β without alteration of HP1γ levels.
