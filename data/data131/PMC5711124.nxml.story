The motivation for this study was to reduce physics workload relating to patient‐specific quality assurance (QA). VMAT plan delivery accuracy was determined from analysis of pre‐ and on‐treatment trajectory log files and phantom‐based ionization chamber array measurements. The correlation in this combination of measurements for patient‐specific QA was investigated. The relationship between delivery errors and plan complexity was investigated as a potential method to further reduce patient‐specific QA workload. Thirty VMAT plans from three treatment sites — prostate only, prostate and pelvic node (PPN), and head and neck (H&N) — were retrospectively analyzed in this work. The 2D fluence delivery reconstructed from pretreatment and on‐treatment trajectory log files was compared with the planned fluence using gamma analysis. Pretreatment dose delivery verification was also carried out using gamma analysis of ionization chamber array measurements compared with calculated doses. Pearson correlations were used to explore any relationship between trajectory log file (pretreatment and on‐treatment) and ionization chamber array gamma results (pretreatment). Plan complexity was assessed using the MU/ arc and the modulation complexity score (MCS), with Pearson correlations used to examine any relationships between complexity metrics and plan delivery accuracy. Trajectory log files were also used to further explore the accuracy of MLC and gantry positions. Pretreatment 1%/1 mm gamma passing rates for trajectory log file analysis were 99.1% (98.7%–99.2%), 99.3% (99.1%–99.5%), and 98.4% (97.3%–98.8%) (median (IQR)) for prostate, PPN, and H&N, respectively, and were significantly correlated to on‐treatment trajectory log file gamma results (
