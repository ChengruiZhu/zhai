Gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) have emerged as a promising anticancer drug delivery scaffold. However, some controversial points still require further investigation before clinical use. A complete understanding of how animal cells interact with drug-conjugated AuNPs of well-defined sizes remains poorly understood. In this study, we prepared a series of 10-hydroxycamptothecin (HCPT)-AuNP conjugates of different sizes and compared their cytotoxic effect in vitro and antitumor effect in vivo. Transmission electron micrographs showed that the NPs had a round, regular shape with a mean diameter of ~10, 25, and 50 nm. An in vitro drug release study showed that HCPT was continuously released for 120 hours. HCPT-AuNPs showed greater cytotoxic effects on the MDA-MB-231 cell line compared with an equal dose of free HCPT. Notably, HCPT-AuNPs of an average diameter of 50 nm (HCPT-AuNPs-50) had the greatest effect. Furthermore, administration of HCPT-AuNPs-50 showed the most tumor-suppressing activity against MDA-MB-231 tumor in mice among all treatment groups. The results indicate that AuNPs not only act as a carrier but also play an active role in mediating biological effects. This work gives important insights into the design of nanoscale delivery and therapeutic systems.
