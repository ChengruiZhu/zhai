A disintegrin and metalloproteinase-17 (ADAM17) has been shown to regulate numerous proteins involved in the cell cycle, as well as tumor oncogenes. The expression pattern of ADAM17 in glioma patients, however, is unclear. In the present study, the expression pattern and prognostic significance of ADAM17 was investigated in patients with glioma. A total of 60 glioma specimens and eight normal control samples were obtained. Immunohistochemical and western blot analyses were used to examine the expression of ADAM17. In addition, the association of ADAM17 expression with the clinicopathological parameters and the survival rates of the glioma patients was analyzed. The results showed that ADAM17 was upregulated in the high-grade glioma tissues compared with that in the low-grade and normal brain tissues of the glioma patients, and that the level increased with ascending World Health Organization tumor grade (P<0.05). Furthermore, the survival rate of the patients with ADAM17-positive tumors was lower compared with the patients with ADAM17-negative tumors. These results indicated that the overexpression of ADAM17 was correlated with a high tumor grade and a poor prognosis in patients with glioma. ADAM17 may have an important oncogenic function in glioma progression, and is a potential diagnostic and therapeutic target.
