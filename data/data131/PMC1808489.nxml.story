To maintain a stable intracellular environment, cells are equipped with multiple specialized defense programs that are launched in response to various external chemical and physical stressors. These anti-stress mechanisms comprise primarily gene regulatory networks, and like many manmade control devices, such as thermostats and automobile cruise controls, they are often organized into negative feedback circuits. A quantitative understanding of how these control circuits operate in the cell can help us to assess and predict more accurately the cellular impacts brought about by perturbing stressors, such as environmental toxicants. Using control theory and computer simulations, we explored nature's design principle for anti-stress gene regulatory networks, and the manner in which cells respond and adapt to perturbations. We showed that cells can exploit multiple mechanisms, such as protein homodimerization, cooperative binding, and auto-regulation, to enhance the feedback loop gain, which, according to control theory, is a basic principle for effective perturbation resistance. We also illustrated that the steady-state dose response curve is likely to transition through multiple phases as stressor level increases, and that the low-dose region is inherently nonlinear. Our results challenge the common practice of linear extrapolation for evaluating the low-dose effect, and would lead to improved human health risk assessment for exposures to environmental toxicants.
