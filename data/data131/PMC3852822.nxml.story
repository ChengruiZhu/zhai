We identified 25 reported cases of IPH in children from the database (20 females and 5 males). Among them, 5 presented with Down syndrome. Upon diagnosis, median age was 4.3 [0.8-14.0] yrs, and the main manifestations were: dyspnea (n = 17, 68%), anemia (n = 16, 64%), cough (n = 12, 48%), febrile pneumonia (n = 11, 44%) and hemoptysis (n = 11, 44%). Half of the patients demonstrated diffuse parenchymal infiltrates on chest imaging, and diagnosis was ascertained either by broncho-alveolar lavage indicating the presence of hemosiderin-laden macrophages (19/25 cases), or lung biopsy (6/25). In screened patients, initial auto-immune screening revealed positive antineutrophilic cytoplasmic antibodies (ANCA) (n = 6, 40%), antinuclear antibodies (ANA) (n = 5, 45%) and specific coeliac disease antibodies (n = 4, 28%). All the patients were initially treated by corticosteroids. In 13 cases, immunosuppressants were introduced due to corticoresistance and/or major side effects. Median length of follow-up was 5.5 yrs, with a satisfactory respiratory outcome in 23/25 patients. One patient developed severe pulmonary fibrosis, and another with Down syndrome died as a result of severe pulmonary hemorrhage.
