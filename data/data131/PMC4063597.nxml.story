Metastasis is considered to be the major cause of mortality in patients with cancer, and gastric cancer is a highly metastatic cancer. In the present study, the anti-metastatic activity of chitooligosaccharide (COS) in human gastric cancer cells and its underlying mechanism were investigated. It was found that COS significantly inhibited SGC-7901 cell proliferation and metastasis in a dose-dependent manner, as observed by MTT, wound-healing and Transwell assays. Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction and western blot analysis indicated that COS could decrease the expression of cluster of differentiation 147 (CD147) and subsequently reduce matrix metalloproteinase-2 (MMP-2) expression. A clear dose-dependent inhibition of MMP-2 activity was also observed in SGC-7901 cells following treatment with COS in gelatin zymography experiments. Furthermore, overexpression of CD147 (when transfected with pEGFP-C1 plasmid) in SGC-7901 cells partially protected against COS-induced inhibition of MMP-2. The results of the present study demonstrated the potential of COS in suppressing gastric cancer metastasis, and that the CD147/MMP-2 pathway may be involved as the key mechanism of its anti-metastatic effect.
