Forty-two athletes participated in the study over three consecutive collegiate baseball seasons. Our preseason normative values for ROM, MMT, and the KJOC questionnaire are shown in Tables 1, 2, and 3. The mean KJOC score for our cohort was 86.93/100 (SD 12.49), and the mean MASES score was 88.4/100 (SD 21.7). The mean FMS score in our cohort was 15/21 (SD 3). Injury data for our cohort are shown in Table 4. After three full seasons, a lower KJOC score significantly correlated with injury days missed (Spearman's rho = 0.63, P-value 0.0122). Through the first two seasons, pitchers with a 1% higher UE rating on the UEPH questionnaire had 9.5% lower odds of developing injury during the season (OR 0.9149, 95% CI 0.8525-0.9819, P Value 0.014). Pitchers reporting every 1 unit higher of subjective instability had 61.27% higher odds of developing an UE injury (OR 0.6127, 95% CI 1.1044-2.3549, P value 0.013). However, by the end of the third season, and after adjusting for the use of pain medication, these variables failed to reach significance in our multiple regression analysis. Dominant shoulder TAM, rotator cuff strength, and glenohumeral internal rotation deficit (GIRD) were not predictive of injury in our cohort; although having over 5 degrees of difference in TAM vs the non-dominant shoulder approached significance (P-value 0.0598).
