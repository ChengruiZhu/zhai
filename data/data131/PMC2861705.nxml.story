The majority of genomic sequences in higher eukaryotes do not contain protein coding genes. Large fractions are covered by repetitive sequences, many of which are derived from transposable elements (TEs). These selfish genes, only containing sequences necessary for self-propagation, can multiply and change their location within the genome, threatening host genome integrity and provoking mutational bursts. Therefore host organisms have evolved a diverse repertoire of defence mechanisms to counteract and silence these genomic parasites. One way is to package DNA sequences containing TEs into transcriptionally inert heterochromatin, which is partly achieved via chemical modification of the packaging proteins associated with DNA, the histones. To better understand the contribution of histone acetylation in the activation of TEs, we treated mouse fibroblasts with a specific histone deacetylase inhibitor. By monitoring the expression of ten different types of murine mobile elements, we identified a defined subset of VL30 transposons specifically reactivated upon increased histone acetylation. Importantly, phosphorylation of histone H3, a modification that is triggered by stress, is required for acetylation-dependent activation of VL30 elements. We present a model where concomitant histone phosphorylation and acetylation cooperate in the transcriptional induction of VL30 elements.
