Objective:To determine the effect of different retraction cord medicaments on surface detail reproduction of polyvinyl siloxane impression materials and compare this effect on any two brands of commercially available polyvinyl siloxane impression materials.
Material and methods: Four stainless steel dies were made according to ADA specification no.19. Three dies were treated with aluminium chloride (5%), ferric sulphate (13.3%) and epinephrine (0.1%) while the fourth one was left untreated to serve as control. Two impression materials (Dentsply and 3M ESPE) were used. 
Results: All the three medicaments adversely affected the surface detail reproduction of both the brands of the polyvinyl siloxane impression materials. These effects were statistically significant as compared to untreated control. The impressions of 3M ESPE brand have shown better surface detail reproduction as compared to Dentsply impression material.
Conclusion: Surface detail reproduction of the polyvinyl siloxane impression materials is adversely affected by the retraction cord medicaments. The presence of moisture or any traces of the medicaments should be removed from the tooth surface to provide a dry field for the correct reproduction of the surface detail of these materials.
