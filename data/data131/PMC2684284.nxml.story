Subjects are elderly 80 patients (69-78, median age 72.0) with urinary incontinence, who are clinically diagnosed with wet OAB without urodynamics (pressure/flow study). For 3 months, they were administered anticholinergics (propiverine hydrochloride 20 mg/once per day in the morning), but all their quality of life (QOL) score were 4 or over due to poor control of storage symptoms and urinary incontinence. We selected patients for whom anticholinergics were not effective (above-mentioned 80 patients) and they were provided with IF alone for 3 months with informed consent. Before and after IF, the followings were examined. (1) frequency of IF treatment required to show optimal effects, (2) average weekly frequency of incontinence, (3) 60-min pad test, (4) frequency and voided volume in the daytime and nighttime, (5) fluid intake volume, (6) International Prostate Symptom Score, quality of life score, (7) Uroflowmetry, (8) postvoid residual urine volume, (9) specific gravity of urine, (10) average hours spent outdoors, (11) average radius of action and activities of daily life score, (12) standing blood pressure (BP) and heart rate, (13) clinical laboratory findings, (14) adverse events, (15) plasma osmotic pressure (OP), and (16) Brain natriuretic peptide (BNP).
