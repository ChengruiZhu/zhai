Ten patients were included in the surgical dislocation group, and 20 pair-matched patients were included in the arthroscopic group. 100% patient follow-up was obtained at mean 24.8 months in the open group and 25.5 months in the arthroscopic group. Preoperative mHHS, NAHS, HOS-ADL and HOS-SSS were similar between the two groups. Both the arthroscopic group and the surgical dislocation group had significant postoperative improvement at 3 months, 1 year and final follow-up for all scores. In comparing the two groups, the ΔHOS-SSS was significantly higher in the arthroscopic group at final follow-up, improving 42.8 points versus 23.5 in the surgical dislocation (p=0.047). The arthroscopic group also had significantly better NAHS at 3 months (88.1 vs. 75.3, p=0.016) and at final follow-up. (94.2 vs. 85.7, p=0.01). Nine out of 10 patients in the dislocation group had good/excellent results, and 19 out of 20 patients in the arthroscopic group had good/excellent results. Patient satisfaction for the open group was 8.1, and 9.2 in the arthroscopic group (p=0.07). Both groups showed a significant decrease in the alpha angle postoperatively, from 58° to 40° in the dislocation group, and 57° to 40° in the arthroscopic group, with no difference between the groups (p=0.775). The dislocation group had 8 patients undergo hardware removal, and two required hip arthroscopy for continued pain.
