EpCAM is a well-established marker for carcinomas of epithelial origin and a potential target for immunotherapy. In vitro analyses have implicated EpCAM in a plethora of different cellular processes, such as adhesion, motility, proliferation, differentiation, and signaling. Strikingly, depending on the context, EpCAM displayed rather opposite effects, either promoting or attenuating cell–cell adhesion versus cell migration and tissue invasion, a phenomenon described as the “double-face” of EpCAM. However, the in vivo relevance of its different effects remained largely unclear. Here, we present the first genetic analysis of EpCAM function in vivo, based on loss-of-function mutants in the zebrafish. As it is in mammals, zebrafish EpCAM is expressed in simple epithelia. Mutant embryos display defects both in epithelial morphogenesis and in epithelial integrity. Reduced epithelial morphogenesis is accompanied, and possibly caused, by an extension of apical junctional complexes and compromised basal protrusive activity. Furthermore, mutant epithelia display alterations in the relative abundance of adherence junction versus tight junction components. In addition, EpCAM tightly cooperates with E-cadherin and has a previously unrecognized trans effect on the morphogenesis and integrity of underlying cell layers. Cell differentiation and proliferation in EpCAM mutants are not, or only secondarily, affected. During later development and adulthood, EpCAM is largely dispensable, reinforcing its suitability as a target for anti-carcinoma immunotherapy with minimal side effects.
