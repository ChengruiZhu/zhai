ATE1-mediated post-translational addition of arginine to a protein has been shown to regulate activity, interaction, and stability of the protein substrates. Arginylation has been linked to many different stress conditions, namely ER stress, cytosolic misfolded protein stress, and nitrosative stress. However, clear understanding about the effect of arginylation in cellular stress responses is yet to emerge. In this study, we investigated the role of arginylation in heat-stress response. Our findings suggest that Ate1 knock out (KO) cells are more susceptible to heat stress compared with its wild-type counterparts due to the induction of apoptosis in KO cells. Gene expression analysis of inducible heat-shock proteins (HSP70.1, HSP70.3, and HSP40) showed induction of these genes in KO cells early in the heat shock, but were drastically diminished at the later period of heat shock. Further analysis revealed that loss of ATE1 drastically reduced the stability of all three HSP mRNAs. These phenotypes were greatly restored by overexpression of Ate1 in KO cells. Our findings show that arginylation plays a protective role during heat stress by regulating HSP gene expression and mRNA stability.
