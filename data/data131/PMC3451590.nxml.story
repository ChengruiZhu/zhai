Since it is extremely important to fully evaluate the psychological characteristics of young headache sufferers and their family circle, we have implemented a diagnostic therapeutic protocol arranged in a number of day hospital (D. H.) sessions. These include a series of specialist examinations and dialogues with child and parent together, in addition to projective, drawing, Rorschach and psychometric tests. It has been found that the more frequent elements triggering headache in a child arise in the family: from competition between the child and the family figure (sibling, either parent, etc.), and the lack of the same. Once the causative link has been identified, a process must be initiated that gives rise to a doubt, without demonising the parents. A way must be found for parents and child to better communicate each other. We strongly trust the D. H. treatment and we have presented a paper at the HIS conference in Rome about this subject, in order to prove that it is successful in most cases. Several clinical cases have been included in our study, to show how the D. H. works and the successful results achieved. In synthesis, a young headache sufferer is a subject who is very sensitive to the external environment surrounding him/her, therefore, it is of paramount importance to deeply examine his behavior and find the causes that trigger headache, in order to help him/her to avoid them, through pharmacological treatment, behavioral therapy, biofeedback, relaxation and finally therapy with the assistance of animals.
