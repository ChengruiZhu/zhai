TIPP is a novel thymic immunosuppressive pentapeptide originally obtained from calf thymic immunosuppressive extract. The present study aimed to investigate the inhibitory activity of TIPP on IgE-mediated activation of RBL-2H3 cells. Release of β-hexosaminidase and histamine, intracellular calcium, membrane ruffling, mRNA levels of cytokines, cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) expression, and activation of mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAP kinases) and NF-κB were determined by colorimetric assay, fluorescence spectrophotometer, confocal fluorescence microscope, quantification PCR, and Western blot, respectively. The results showed that TIPP significantly inhibited the degranulation in IgE-antigen complex-stimulated RBL-2H3 cells without cytotoxicity. TIPP significantly suppressed the increase of intracellular calcium and the rearrangement of F-actin, attenuated the transcription of pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-3, -4, -6, -13, TNF-α, and monocyte chemotactic protein-1 (MCP-1)), and decreased the expression of COX-2. Western blot analysis showed that TIPP had an inhibitory activity on the phosphorylation of extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2) and ERK kinase 1/2 (MEK1/2), and inhibited the activation of NF-κB. The data suggested that TIPP effectively suppressed IgE-mediated activation of RBL-2H3 cells via blocking MEK/ERK and NF-κB signaling pathways.
