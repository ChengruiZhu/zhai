Histone deacetylases (HDACs) are enzymes that reverse acetylation of protein substrates inside the cell. Like phosphorylation, acetylation/deacetylation can alter the biochemical properties of a protein target and thereby regulate its functions. Histones are a major target of certain HDACs. When histones become deacetylated, the biochemical properties of the local chromatin are altered, which can contribute to gene silencing. HDACs can also act upon protein substrates besides histones. There are multiple HDACs encoded in animal genomes, with eleven HDACs in humans. Thus, it becomes complicated to determine which individual HDACs exert which biological functions in vivo. To address this, we have isolated and studied mutations that specifically disrupt a single HDAC, HDAC3, in Drosophila. We find that a major function of HDAC3 is to prevent programmed cell death from occurring abnormally in certain fly tissues. This finding has implications for anticancer strategies since HDAC chemical inhibitors can reduce tumors in animal models through induction of cell death. Our study identifies HDAC3 as a single HDAC among many that can play a key role in control of cell death and suggests that this version of the enzyme should be further investigated for regulatory roles in tumor cell killing versus survival.
