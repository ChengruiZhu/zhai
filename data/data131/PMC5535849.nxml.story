Cerebral edema, primarily caused by disruption of the blood-brain barrier (BBB), is one of the serious complications associated with brain injury in neonatal hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy (HIE). Our recent study demonstrated that the hypoxic-ischemic (HI) treatment significantly increased microRNA-210 (miR-210) in the neonatal rat brain and inhibition of miR-210 provided neuroprotection in neonatal HI brain injury. The present study aims to determine the role of miR-210 in the regulation of BBB integrity in the developing brain. miR-210 mimic was administered via intracerebroventricular injection (i.c.v.) into the brain of rat pups. Forty-eight hours after the injection, a modified Rice-Vannucci model was conducted to produce HI brain injury. Post-assays included cerebral edema analysis, western blotting, and immunofluorescence staining for serum immunoglobulin G (IgG) leakage. The results showed that miR-210 mimic exacerbated cerebral edema and IgG leakage into the brain parenchyma. In contrast, inhibition of miR-210 with its complementary locked nucleic acid oligonucleotides (miR-210-LNA) significantly reduced cerebral edema and IgG leakage. These findings suggest that miR-210 negatively regulates BBB integrity in the neonatal brain. Mechanistically, the seed sequences of miR-210 were identified complementary to the 3′ untranslated region (3′ UTR) of the mRNA transcripts of tight junction protein occludin and adherens junction protein β-catenin, indicating downstream targets of miR-210. This was further validated by in vivo data showing that miR-210 mimic significantly reduced the expression of these junction proteins in rat pup brains. Of importance, miR-210-LNA preserved the expression of junction proteins occludin and β-catenin from neonatal HI insult. Altogether, the present study reveals a novel mechanism of miR-210 in impairing BBB integrity that contributes to cerebral edema formation after neonatal HI insult, and provides new insights in miR-210-LNA mediated neuroprotection in neonatal HI brain injury.
