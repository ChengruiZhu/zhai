The present study sought to determine the survival outcomes for women diagnosed with breast and endometrial cancer. Using SEER data, a population-based cohort study of women diagnosed with breast and endometrial cancer was conducted. Kaplan-Meier survival curves were created for disease-specific survival rates. A total of 2,027 women diagnosed with breast and endometrial cancer were identified. Of these, 1,296 (63.9%) developed breast cancer first and 731 (36.1%) developed endometrial cancer first. Regional lymph node involvement was significantly more common with a breast cancer diagnosis [522 (25.8%) women] compared with an endometrial cancer diagnosis [87 (4.3%) women] (P<0.05). Factors associated with decreased survival included a high tumor grade in endometrial cancer, nodal positivity and estrogen receptor-negative breast cancer (P<0.05 for each). There were 83 (4.1%) mortalities due to breast cancer, 63 (3.1%) mortalities due to endometrial cancer and 178 (8.8%) mortalities due to other causes (P<0.05). In conclusion, for women diagnosed with breast and endometrial cancer, the cumulative risk of mortality at five years following the second cancer diagnosis is nearly four times more likely to be due to breast cancer than endometrial cancer.
