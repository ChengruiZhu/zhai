Cell migration is important for many biological processes: white blood cells chase down and kill bacteria to guard against infection, epithelial cells crawl across open wounds to promote healing, and embryonic cells move collectively to form organs and tissues during embryogenesis. In all of these cases, migration depends on the spatial and temporal organization of multiple forces, including actin-driven protrusion of the cell membrane, membrane tension, cell-substrate adhesion, and myosin-mediated contraction of the actin network. In this work, we have used a simple cell type, the fish epithelial keratocyte, as a model system to investigate the manner in which these forces are integrated to give rise to large-scale emergent properties such as cell shape and movement. Keratocytes are normally fan-shaped and fast-moving, but we have found that keratocytes migrate more slowly and assume round or asymmetric shapes when cell-substrate adhesion strength is too high or too low. By correlating measurements of adhesion-dependent changes in cell shape and speed with measurements of adhesion and myosin localization patterns and actin network organization, we have developed a mechanical model in which keratocyte shape and movement emerge from adhesion and myosin-dependent regulation of the dynamic actin cytoskeleton.
