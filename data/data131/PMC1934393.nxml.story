Transgenic mice are key models to shed new light on gene function during development and disease. Reliable high-throughput screening tools will facilitate the identification of transgenic mice with distinct phenotypes. In particular, alterations of the skull are difficult to detect by visual inspection due to its very complex morphological structure. Here, we used high-resolution flat-panel volume computed tomography (fpVCT), a novel semi-automatic screening tool to image skull-shape features of mice. The resulting 3-D datasets were combined with artificial neuronal networks and complex nonlinear computational models to permit rapid and automatic interpretation of the images. Compared to the extremely laborious landmark-based analysis, the manual work in our approach was reduced to the control of skull segmentation of images obtained by fpVCT. We applied our approach to genetically altered mice and various mouse strains and showed that it is an accurate and reliable method to successfully identify mice with skeletal phenotypes. We suggest the new methodology will also be a valuable tool for an in vivo, rapid, cost-effective, and reliable primary screen to identify skull abnormalities generated by random mouse mutagenesis experiments.
