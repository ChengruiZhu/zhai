, chromosomal signals determine sex. Diploid flies with two X chromosomes are female, whereas those with one X are male. Conventionally, it is thought that the ratio of the number of X chromosomes to autosomes (X:A) constitutes the signal, because triploid flies bearing two X chromosomes and three sets of autosomes (XX;AAA) are intersexual. Under this model, the X:A signal is defined as the balance between a set of X-linked “numerator” proteins that promote female development and autosomally encoded “denominator” proteins that counteract the numerator elements. Although the X:A signal is a textbook standard, only one strong denominator element exists, and it cannot account for the effects of altered chromosome number (ploidy) on sex. To understand how X and autosome doses influence sex, we examined haploids (1X;1A) and triploids during the brief embryonic period when sex is determined. We found that ploidy affects sex indirectly by increasing in haploids, or decreasing in triploids, the number of embryonic cell cycles in which chromosomal sex is assessed. Our findings indicate that the fly sex-determination signal is more accurately viewed as a function of the number of X chromosomes rather than as a value of the X:A ratio.
