The process of moving hydrophobic amino acids into the core of a protein by desolvation is important in protein folding. However, a rapid and forced desolvation can lead to precipitation of proteins. Desolvation of proteins under controlled conditions generates nanoparticles â€“ homogeneous aggregates with a narrow size distribution. The protein nanoparticles, under physiological conditions, undergo surface erosion due to the action of proteases, releasing the entrapped drug/gene. The packing density of protein nanoparticles significantly influences the release kinetics. We have investigated the desolvation process of gelatin, exploring the role of pH and desolvating agent in nanoparticle synthesis. Our results show that the desolvation process, initiated by the addition of acetone, follows distinct pathways for gelatin incubated at different pH values and results in the generation of nanoparticles with varying matrix densities. The nanoparticles synthesized with varying matrix densities show variations in drug loading and protease-dependent extra- and intracellular drug release. These results will be useful in fine-tuning the synthesis of nanoparticles with desirable drug release profiles.
