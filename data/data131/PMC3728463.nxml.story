There has been growing concern about the role of sugar-sweetened beverages (SSBs) in the development of obesity. This study investigated factors associated with SSB intake among Korean children (7-12 years) and adolescents (13-18 years). We examined associations between SSB intake and demographic and dietary factors using nationally representative data from the 2008-2011 Korea National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, and 3,179 children and 2,242 adolescents were included in the final analysis. We calculated adjusted odds ratios (ORs) for factors associated with high SSB intake (≥ 300 ml/day) by multivariable logistic regression. The mean daily SSB intake of school children was 98.7 ml/day, with a mean of 64.7 ml/day for those aged 7-12 years and 120.2 ml/day for those aged 13-18 years. SSB intake of ≥ 300 ml/day was found in 12.0% of the children and adolescents. Factors associated with a greater OR for high SSB intake were high energy intake (≥ 125% of EER; OR = 3.17 for boys aged 7-12 years, OR = 2.74 for girls aged 7-12 years, OR = 3.0 for girls aged 13-18 years), low milk consumption (< 1 cup/day; OR = 1.93 for boys aged 7-12 years; OR = 2.53 for girls aged 7-12 years; OR = 1.83 for boys aged 13-18 years), and not meeting the recommended fruit and vegetable intake (< 400 g/day; OR = 1.71 for boys aged 7-12 years). Being overweight and obese was significantly associated with greater ORs for high SSB intake among boys aged 7-12 years (OR = 1.72). These findings may be used to develop targeted education programs for reducing SSB intake and encouraging healthier food choices.
