Recent evidence points to two potentially fundamental aspects of the default network (DN), which have been relatively understudied. One is the temporal nature of the functional interactions among nodes of the network in the resting-state, usually assumed to be static. The second is possible influences of previous brain states on the spatial patterns (i.e., the brain regions involved) of functional connectivity (FC) in the DN at rest. The goal of the current study was to investigate modulations in both the spatial and temporal domains. We compared the resting-state FC of the DN in two runs that were separated by a 45 minute interval containing cognitive task execution. We used partial least squares (PLS), which allowed us to identify FC spatiotemporal patterns in the two runs and to determine differences between them. Our results revealed two primary modes of FC, assessed using a posterior cingulate seed â€“ a robust correlation among DN regions that is stable both spatially and temporally, and a second pattern that is reduced in spatial extent and more variable temporally after cognitive tasks, showing switching between connectivity with certain DN regions and connectivity with other areas, including some task-related regions. Therefore, the DN seems to exhibit two
