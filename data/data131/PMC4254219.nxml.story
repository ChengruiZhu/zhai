In this study, we show that CK2α is over-expressed and a positive regulator of Hegdehog/Gli1 signaling in human malignant pleural mesothelioma. First of all, we found that the mRNA levels of CK2α and Gli1 were broadly elevated and correlated (n = 52, r = 0.401, P < 0.05), compared with LP9 (a normal mesothelial cell line). We then investigated their expression at the protein level, and found that all the 7 mesothelioma cell lines tested showed positive staining in CK2α and Gli1 immunohistochemistry. Correlation analysis by Pearson test for CK2α and Gli1 expression in the 75 mesothelioma tumors and the 7 mesothelioma cell lines showed that the two protein expression was significantly correlated (n = 82, r = 0.554, P < 0.01). Furthermore, we demonstrated that Gli1 expression and transcriptional activity were down-regulated after CK2α was silenced in two mesothelioma cell lines (H28 and H2052). CK2α siRNA also down-regulated the expression of Hh target genes in these cell lines. Moreover, treatment with a small-molecule CK2α inhibitor CX-4945 led to dose-dependent inhibition of Gli1 expression and transcriptional activity. Conversely, forced over-expression of CK2α resulted in an increase in Gli1 transcriptional activity in H28 cells.
