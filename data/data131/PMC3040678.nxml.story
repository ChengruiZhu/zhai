An evolutionary conserved orchestra of transcription factors controls cardiac development and function. More recently the contributions of epigenetic and post-transcriptional mechanisms like histone modifications and microRNAs have been identified. The interplay between these regulatory mechanisms is still an open question. However, perturbations of the cardiac transcriptome, triggered by all three levels of regulation, are underlying cardiovascular disease such as congenital heart malformations. Here, we show the impact of the interdependencies of four key transcription factors (Gata4, Mef2a, Nkx2.5, and Srf) and the contribution of activating histone modifications and microRNAs on the cardiac transcriptome. We found that even these non-paralogous transcription factors can partially compensate each other's function. Our data show that histone 3 acetylation correlates with Srf- and Gata4- dependent gene activation. Moreover, we predict a large proportion of indirect Srf targets to be regulated by Srf-dependent microRNAs, which thus might represent an important intermediate layer of regulation. Taken together, we suggest that the different levels regulating cardiac mRNA profiles have a high degree of interdependency and the potential to buffer each other, which presents a starting point to understand the phenotypic variability typically seen in complex cardiovascular disorders.
