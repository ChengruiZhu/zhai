In neurons, up-regulation of Notch activity either inhibits neurite extension or causes retraction of neurites. Conversely, inhibition of Notch1 facilitates neurite extension. Acid-sensing ion channels (ASICs) are a family of proton-gated cation channels, which play critical roles in synaptic plasticity, learning and memory and spine morphogenesis. Our pilot proteomics data from ASIC1a knock out mice implicated that ASIC1a may play a role in regulating Notch signaling, therefore, we explored whether or not ASIC1a regulates neurite growth during neuronal development through Notch signaling. In this study, we determined the effects of ASIC1a on neurite growth in a mouse neuroblastoma cell line, NS20Y cells, by modulating ASIC1a expression. We also determined the relationship between ASIC1a and Notch signaling on neuronal differentiation. Our results showed that down-regulation of ASIC1a in NS20Y cells inhibits CPT-cAMP induced neurite growth, while over expression of ASIC1a promotes its growth. In addition, down-regulation of ASIC1a increased the expression of Notch1 and its target gene Survivin while inhibitor of Notch significantly prevented the neurite extension induced by ASIC1a in NS20Y cells. These data indicate that Notch1 signaling may be required for ASIC1a-mediated neurite growth and neuronal differentiation.
