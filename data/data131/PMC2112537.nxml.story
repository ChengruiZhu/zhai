The ability of glycopeptides, isolated from bovine cerebral cortex, to alter cell division was studied by cell-cycle analyses. The results showed that glycopeptides arrested baby hamster kidney (BHK)-21 cells and Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells in the G2 phase of the cell cycle. Upon removal of the growth inhibition from arrested BHK-21 cells, the mitotic index in colchicine-treated cultures increased from 5 to 40% within 6 h and the increase in mitotic activity was accompanied by a complete doubling of all arrested cells within this 6- h time period. Determination of DNA content in growth-arrested BHK-21 cells showed that growth-arrested cells contained about twice the DNA of control cell cultures. Although CHO cells treated in a like manner with growth inhibitor could not be arrested for the same length of time as BHK-21 cells (18 h vs. 72 h before initiation of escape) and to the same degree (60% of the cell population vs. 99% of BHK-21 cells), the escape kinetics of CHO cells did indicate a G2 arrest. Approximately 3.5 h after escape began, CHO cell numbers in treated cultures attained the cell numbers found in control cultures. This rapid growth phase occurring in less than 4 h indicated that the growth inhibitor induced a G2 arrest-point in CHO cells that was not lethal since the entire arrested cell population divided.
