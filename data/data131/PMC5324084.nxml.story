Light-initiated additive
manufacturing techniques typically rely
on layer-by-layer addition or continuous extraction of polymers formed
via nonliving, free radical polymerization methods that render the
final materials “dead” toward further monomer insertion;
the polymer chains within the materials cannot be reactivated to induce
chain extension. An alternative “living additive manufacturing”
strategy would involve the use of photocontrolled living radical polymerization
to spatiotemporally insert monomers into dormant “parent”
materials to generate more complex and diversely functionalized “daughter”
materials. Here, we demonstrate a proof-of-concept study of living
additive manufacturing using end-linked polymer gels embedded with
trithiocarbonate iniferters that can be activated by photoinduced
single-electron transfer from an organic photoredox catalyst in solution.
This system enables the synthesis of a wide range of chemically and
mechanically differentiated daughter gels from a single type of parent
gel via light-controlled modification of the parent’s average
composition, strand length, and/or cross-linking density. Daughter
gels that are softer than their parent, stiffer than their parent,
larger but with the same modulus as their parent, thermally responsive,
polarity responsive, healable, and weldable are all realized.
