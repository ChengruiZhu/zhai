The rediscovery of Mendel's laws of inheritance of genetic factors gave rise to the research field of Genetics at the very beginning of the last century. The idea of traits being determined by the effects of inherited genes is thus the conceptual core of Genetics. After more than one century, however, we still lack a completely general mathematical description of how genes can control traits. Such descriptions are called genotype-phenotype maps, or models of genetic effects, and they become particularly cumbersome in the presence of interaction among genes, also referred to as epistasis. The models of genetic effects are necessary for unraveling the genetic architecture of traits—finding the genes underlying them and obtaining estimates of their individual effects and interactions—and for meaningfully using that information to investigate their evolution and to improve response to selection in traits of economical importance. Here, we illustrate the convenience of using a recently developed model of genetic effects with arbitrary epistasis, NOIA, to inspect the genetic architecture of traits. We implement NOIA for practical use with a regression method and exemplify that theory with a real dataset. Further, we discuss the state of the art of genetic modeling and the future perspectives of this subject.
