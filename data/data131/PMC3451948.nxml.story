Headache is the most frequent neurological symptom and common manifestation of pain in children. The needs of this group are poorly understood. The aim of this study is to quantify the extent of unmet need in a primary care paediatric population. A patient questionnaire survey of 2,425 children between the ages of 8 and 17 and an uncontrolled intervention study was undertaken in a large general practice in England. Headache impact was measured before and 4 months after a headache clinic intervention using the paediatric migraine disability assessment score. A total number of 74 (3%) children accepted an invitation for a headache assessment. However, only 49 (2%) attended for consultation of whom 84% were judged to have migraine. A total number of 43 (58%) had been seen before for a headache by their general practitioner. The median impact score was 17 days headache impact in a 3-month period. An intervention by a general practitioner with an interest in headache significantly reduced the headache impact score. There is a significant need amongst children with headache that can be addressed by interventions well within the capacity of general practitioners. Further studies are needed to explore why so few children with headache present to primary care and when they do, why their needs are not adequately addressed.
