Salivary gland carcinomas are a heterogeneous group of tumors with many histological subtypes which occur in both major and minor salivary glands. However, they have a relatively low of incidence. Their rarity limits study size and the ability to perform phase III trials. Therefore, to date, the entire management is usually varied. Certain published studies have paid more attention to the systemic therapy in the management of metastatic or locally recurrent salivary gland cancer, while little effort has been made to study the entire management for this lesions. Although results of treatment for patients with salivary gland carcinoma have improved in recent years, the treatment of salivary gland cancers is still not standardized. And some patients who havenâ€™t received optimal treatment strategies had a reduced survival. In this review, the topics covered include surgery and radiotherapy, selective neck dissection, chemotherapy, and targeted therapy, which aimed to summarize the optimal management approaches and to develop recommendations for managing this lesions. For these rare cancers, there is also a need for a determined, coordinated effort to conduct high-quality clinical trials.
