Adipose-derived stromal vascular fraction (SVF) is a heterogeneous cell source that contains endothelial cells, pericytes, smooth muscle cells, stem cells, and other accessory immune and stromal cells. The SVF cell population has been shown to support vasculogenesis in vitro as well vascular maturation in vivo. Matrigel, an extracellular matrix (ECM) mixture has been utilized in vitro to evaluate tube formation of purified endothelial cell systems. We have developed an in vitro system that utilizes freshly isolated SVF and ECM molecules both in pure form (fibrin, laminin, collagen) as well as premixed form (Matrigel) to evaluate endothelial tip cell formation, endothelial stalk elongation, and early stages of branching and inosculation. Freshly isolated SVF rat demonstrate cell aggregation and clustering (presumptive vasculogenesis) on Matrigel ECM within the first 36 h of seeding followed by tip cell formation, stalk cell formation, branching, and inosculation (presumptive angiogenesis) during the subsequent 4 days of culture. Purified ECM molecules (laminin, fibrin, and collagen) promote cell proliferation but do not recapitulate events seen on Matrigel. We have created an in vitro system that provides a functional assay to study the mechanisms of vasculogenesis and angiogenesis in freshly isolated SVF to characterize SVF’s blood vessel forming potential prior to clinical implantation.
