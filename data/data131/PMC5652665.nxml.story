Multiplex somatic testing has emerged as a strategy to test patients with advanced cancer. We demonstrate our analytic validation approach for a gene hotspot panel and real-time prospective clinical application for any cancer type. The TruSight Tumor 26 assay amplifies 85 somatic hotspot regions across 26 genes. Using cell line and tumor mixes, we observed that 100% of the 14,715 targeted bases had at least 1000x raw coverage. We determined the sensitivity (100%, 95% CI: 96-100%), positive predictive value (100%, 95% CI: 96-100%), reproducibility (100% concordance), and limit of detection (3% variant allele frequency at 1000x read depth) of this assay to detect single nucleotide variants and small insertions and deletions. Next, we applied the assay prospectively in a clinical tumor sequencing study to evaluate 174 patients with metastatic or advanced cancer, including frozen tumors, formalin-fixed tumors, and enriched peripheral blood mononuclear cells in hematologic cancers. We reported one or more somatic mutations in 89 (53%) of the sequenced tumors (167 passing quality filters). Forty-three of these patients (26%) had mutations that would enable eligibility for targeted therapies. This study demonstrates the validity and feasibility of applying TruSight Tumor 26 for pan-cancer testing using multiple specimen types.
