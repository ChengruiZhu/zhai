One of the most common forms of carcinoma in women, cervical invasive squamous cell carcinoma (CIC), often coexists with multiple lesions of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN). CIC and CIN show heterogeneity with respect to both histopathology and biology. To understand the causes, origin, and model of progression of cervical carcinoma, we assessed the clonality of a case with multiple synchronous lesions by analyzing X chromosome inactivation polymorphism, human papillomavirus type 16 (HPV16) sequence variation/mutations, and loss of heterozygosity (LOH). Microdissection was performed on 24 samples from this case, representing the entire lesional situation. The combination of different X chromosome inactivation patterns, two HPV16 point mutations, and LOH at three genomic microsatellite loci, led to the identification of five different “monoclonal” lesions (CIN II, CIN III, and invasive carcinoma nests) and five different “polyclonal” areas (CIN II and normal squamous epithelium). This finding indicated that CIC can originate from multiple precursor cells, from which some clones might progress via multiple steps, namely via CIN II and CIN III, whereas others might develop independently and possibly directly from the carcinoma precursor cells. Our results also supported the view that HPV16 as a “field factor” causes cervical carcinoma, which is probably promoted by the loss of chromosomal material as indicated by the LOH.
