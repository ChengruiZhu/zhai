In recent years, the development of high throughput sequencing and array technologies has enabled the accurate re-sequencing of individual genomes, especially in identifying and reconstructing the variants in an individual's genome compared to a “reference”. The costs and sensitivities of these technologies differ considerably from each other, and even more technologies are expected to appear in the near future. To both reduce the total cost of re-sequencing to an affordable point and be adaptive to these constantly evolving bio-technologies, we propose to build a computationally efficient simulation framework that can help us optimize the combination of different technologies to perform low cost comparative genome re-sequencing, especially in reconstructing large structural variants, which is considered in many respects the most challenging step in genome re-sequencing. Our simulation results quantitatively show how much improvement one can gain in reconstructing large structural variants by integrating different technologies in optimal ways. We envision that in the future, more experimental technologies will be incorporated into this simulation framework and its results can provide informative guidelines for the actual experimental design to achieve optimal genome re-sequencing output at low costs.
