Negatively selected H-2K(b)D(b) TDL can be induced to respond strongly to vaccinia virus presented in the context of both H-2K(k) and H-2D(b) when stimulated in irradiated H-2K(k)D(b) recipients. Addition of excess (H- 2K(k)D(b) x H-2K(b)D(b))F1 TDL, which are low responders to H-2D(b)-vaccinia virus, does not obviously suppress the reactivity pattern of the H-2K(b)D(b) T cells. However, lymphocytes from chimeras made by reconstituting H- 2K(b)D(b) mice with (H-2K(k)D(k) Ã— H-2K(b)D(b))F(l) bone marrow cells make little, if any, cytotoxic T-cell response to vaccinia virus when sensitized in H-2K(k)D(b) recipients. We have thus documented one instance where the responder phenotype of T ceils from an F(l) {arrow} parent chimera is not equivalent to that associated with the H-2 type of the parental thymus. Lymphocytes from both the chimera and the H-2K(b)D(b) parent (after negative selection) are tolerant to the H-2K(k) and I-A(k) alloantigens encountered in the recipient, but the chimera T cells are also defective in their response to a neoantigen (vaccinia virus) presented in the context of H-2K(k) which the parental T cells invariably recognize. It is thus possible that at least part of the phenomenology associated with the F(l) {arrow} parent radiation chimeras reflects deletion of repertoire in the context of H-2 antigens present during thymocyte ontogeny on other than radiation-resistant thymic epithelium.
