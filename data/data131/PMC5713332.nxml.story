Colorectal cancer (CRC) is one of the leading causes of cancer mortality and 5-Fluorouracil (5-FU) is the most common chemotherapy agent of CRC. A high level of X-ray repair cross complementing group 1 (XRCC1) in cancer cells has been associated with the drug resistance occurrence. Moreover, the activation of adenosine monophosphate (AMP)-activated protein kinase (AMPK) has been indicated to regulate the cancer cell survival. Thus, this study was aimed to examine whether XRCC1 plays a role in the 5-FU/AMPK agonist (AICAR)-induced cytotoxic effect on CRC and the underlying mechanisms. Human HCT-116 colorectal cells were used in this study. It was shown that 5-FU increases the XRCC1 expression in HCT-116 cells and then affects the cell survival through CXCR4/Akt signaling. Moreover, 5-FU combined with AICAR further result in more survival inhibition in HCT-116 cells, accompanied with reduced CXCR4/Akt signaling activity and XRCC1 expression. These results elucidate the role and mechanism of XRCC1 in the drug resistance of HCT-116 cells to 5-FU. We also demonstrate the synergistic inhibitory effect of AMPK on 5-FU-inhibited HCT-116 cell survival under the 5-FU and AICAR co-treatment. Thus, our findings may provide a new notion for the future drug regimen incorporating 5-FU and AMPK agonists for the CRC treatment.
