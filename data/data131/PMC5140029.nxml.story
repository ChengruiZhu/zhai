Androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) is well established as a backbone therapy for metastatic prostate cancer (mPCa), and both European and American guidelines emphasize the importance of maintaining ADT after progression to metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC). However, the use of ADT varies widely in clinical practice despite these recommendations. Both research and development of increasingly precise assay technologies have improved our understanding of androgen production and signaling, and the recent data have suggested that a new serum testosterone cutoff value of <0.7 nmol/L should be employed. Most clinical trials to date have used the historical 1.7 nmol/L cutoff, but the <0.7 nmol/L cutoff has been associated with improved patient outcomes. Combining agents with different mechanisms of action to achieve intense androgen blockade may improve survival both before and after progression to CRPC. Data suggest that this intensive approach to androgen deprivation could delay the transition to CPRC and hence improve survival dramatically. Various combinations of backbone ADT with chemotherapy or radiotherapy are under investigation. Administration of ADT is established in patients with intermediate or high-risk localized prostate cancer (PCa) receiving radiotherapy with curative intent. This article reviews the current and potential role of ADT as backbone therapy in both hormone-sensitive PCa and CRPC with a focus on mPCa.
