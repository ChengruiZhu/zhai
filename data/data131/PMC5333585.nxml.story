BPC 157 may serve as a novel mediator of Robertâ€™s cytoprotection, involved in maintaining of GI mucosa integrity, with no toxic effect. BPC 157 was successful in the therapy of GI tract, periodontitis, liver and pancreas lesions, and in the healing of various tissues and wounds. Stimulated Egr-1 gene, NAB2, FAK-paxillin and JAK-2 pathways are hitherto implicated. Initially corresponding beneficial central influence was seen when BPC 157 was given peripherally and a serotonin release in particular brain areas, mostly nigrostriatal, was changed. BPC 157 modulates serotonergic and dopaminergic systems, beneficially affects various behavioral disturbances that otherwise appeared due to specifically (over)stimulated/damaged neurotransmitters systems. Besides, BPC 157 has neuroprotective effects: protects somatosensory neurons; peripheral nerve regeneration appearent after transection; after traumatic brain injury counteracts the otherwise progressing course, in rat spinal cord compression with tail paralysis, axonal and neuronal necrosis, demyelination, cyst formation and rescues tail function in both short-terms and long-terms; after NSAIDs or insulin overdose or cuprizone encephalopathies were attenuated along with GI, liver and vascular injuries.
