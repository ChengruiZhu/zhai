. But at a reaction pH 5.3, and in the alkaline range, there is an irreversible inactivation of complement, complete at pH 4.8 and 8.8 respectively. It is perhaps more than a coincidence that complement fixation, and therefore, hemolysis, are prevented by just those factors which suppress the ionization of serum proteins, and lead to an increased aggregation state. Between a suspension of macroscopically visible particles of euglobulin in distilled water, and a solution is physiological saline, there is certainly a gradual transition, manifested at low electrolyte concentrations by the opacity of the solution. At pH 7.4, globulin would ionize as a Na-salt, an ionization inhibited as the isoelectric point (5.3) is approached, with a coincident greater tendency of the globulin to separate from solution. And the cataphoretic velocity of particles of globulin, as well as all the other properties which are a function of its ionization (viscosity, osmotic pressure, etc.), are suppressed by electrolytes, the degree of suppression being determined by the concentration and valence of the cation (on the alkaline side of the isoelectric point). The analogy with complement fixation is too complete to be dismissed as fortuitous. 3. The fact that the degree of complement "fixation" increases with the degree of sensitization explains one of the most puzzling phenomena in hemolysis,â€”that immune serum and complement are, to a certain extent, interchangeable, a decrease in either factor being compensated by an increase in the other (8), (20), (22). The explanation is evident from Figs. 1,2, and 3. The exact quantitative relationships involved will be developed in a later paper. With increasing sensitization there is an enormously more complete and more rapid fixation of complement, and correspondingly more rapid hemolysis, exactly the effect produced by increasing the quantity of complement instead of amboceptor (Fig. 3). All other variables being constant, the velocity of hemolysis is determined by the amount of complement adsorbed. With more amboceptor, a greater proportion is "fixed" by the cell; with more complement, a smaller proportion, but a larger absolute amount. The result is the same: more complement adsorbed, and a corresponding acceleration of hemolysis. If this mobilization of complement is the sole function of immuneserum (and there is as yet no reason to assume any other), then the accepted terminology, in which amboceptor, immune body, and hemolysin are used synonymously, is erroneous. The immune body would function only as an "amboceptor," mobilizing the effective hemolysin, complement, upon the surface of the cell. Nothing has been said of the multiple components into which complement may be split.
