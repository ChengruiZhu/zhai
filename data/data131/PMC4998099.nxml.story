The aim of the present study was to assess the efficacy and safety of topical timolol maleate combined with oral propranolol for parotid infantile hemangiomas. Between October 2012 and April 2014, propranolol was administered orally at a dose of 1.0–1.5 mg/kg/day to 22 infants with proliferating hemangiomas in the Department of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery (Hospital of Stomatology, China Medical University, Shenyang, Liaoning, China). A small amount of 0.5% timolol maleate eye drop solution was topically applied with medical cotton swabs to the area of the lesion twice a day, every 12 h. The study group consisted of 9 males and 13 females, aged 2–9 months, with a median age of 4.7 months. The lesions were all located in the parotid region, and measured between 3.5×4×0.5 and 7×8×3 cm in volume. The planned duration of therapy was 6–8 months, or the two drugs were stopped when complete regression of the lesions was obtained. The therapeutic outcomes and safety were assessed by the change in the size and color of the tumor, and the presence of adverse effects throughout the course of treatment. The mean duration of therapy was 21.1 weeks and ranged from 3 to 8 months. Of the 22 patients, 16 demonstrated an excellent response, 6 showed a good response and 2 displayed a moderate response. No major collateral effects were observed. Overall, oral propranolol combined with topical timolol maleate may be used as the first-line therapeutic choice in the treatment of infantile parotid mixed hemangioma.
