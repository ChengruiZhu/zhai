Accelerating the integration of a joint replacement or the healing of a bone fracture, particularly a complicated non-union fracture, would improve patient welfare and decrease healthcare costs. Currently, an autologous bone graft is the gold standard method for the treatment of complicated non-union fractures, but it is not always possible to harvest such a graft. A proactive highly inductive so-called smart material approach is pertinent in these cases. In this study, the surface chemistry of a previously approved material with desirable bulk material properties was modified to investigate its potential as an economical and effective alternative. The objective was to create stable synthetic chemical coatings that could guide cells along the osteogenic lineage required to generate mineralised tissue that would induce and accelerate bone healing. Primary human osteoblast-like cells were cultured in vitro for 7, 14 and 28 days on amine-terminated (chain length in the range 3–11) silane-modified glass surfaces with controlled nanotopography, to determine how surface chemistry and nanotopography change osteoblast function. The materials were characterised using atomic force microscopy (AFM), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), water contact angle (WCA) and a novel ninhydrin assay. The cells were analysed using qRT-PCR, von Kossa tinctural staining for mineralisation, and visualised using both transmitted white light and electron microscopy. Bone-like nodules, quantified using microscopy, only formed on the short-chain (chain length 3 and 4) amines after 7 days, as did the up-regulation of sclerostin, suggestive of a more mature osteoblast phenotype. In this paper, we report more rapid nodule formation than has previously been observed, without the addition of exogenous factors in the culture medium. This suggests that the coating would improve the integration of implants with bone or be the basis of a smart biomaterial that would accelerate the bone regeneration process.
