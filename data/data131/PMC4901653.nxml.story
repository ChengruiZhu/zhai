In total, 1,142 athletes in 12 sports (baseball/softball, basketball, football, golf, gymnastics, rowing, swimming & diving, soccer, tennis, track & field/cross country, volleyball, water polo) were identified. There were 262 documented orthopaedic surgeries, including those involving the shoulder (n = 34), hip (n = 25), and knee (n = 72), in 182 athletes. Using the multiple Cox regression model, pre-college lower extremity surgery was an independent predictor of orthopaedic (P = 0.004, HR = 1.88) and knee (P < 0.001, HR = 3.91) surgery, and type of sport was an independent predictor of orthopaedic (P < 0.001), shoulder (P = 0.002), and knee surgery (P < 0.001) (Table 1). Participation in gymnastics, basketball, and volleyball were the strongest predictors of orthopaedic surgery. Similarly, participation in volleyball, gymnastics, and baseball/softball were the strongest predictors of shoulder surgery, and participation in basketball, football, and volleyball were the strongest predictors of knee surgery. Lastly, athletes with a history of a pre-college orthopaedic surgery were more susceptible to another surgery in the same extremity during college (P = 0.046, HR = 2.18). Gender was not a significant predictor of any surgery. No independent predictors of hip surgery were identified.
