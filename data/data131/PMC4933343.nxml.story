The fluid-structure-electrical interaction in the cochlea enable the basilar membrane, one of the most important structures in the cochlear partition, to display different dynamic patterns depending on the frequency content of the incoming sound. Interestingly, in a healthy cochlea the motion of the basilar membrane shows echoes upon an impulse acoustic stimulation delivered to the ear canal. The delay, duration, and shape of these echoes vary from one cochlea to another. A hypothesis that irregularities of the properties of the cochlear partition coherently scatter acoustic waves and generate echoes is examined. These irregularities are posited to arise, for example, the damage of the sensory cells or the natural randomness in the morphology of the cochlear partition. Here we build a physiologically-based mathematical model to understand the echoes observed in experiments by introducing irregularity to the properties of the sensory cells. We found that the patterns of the echoes depend on the individual profiles of the irregularities. Our work suggest that the ear canal recording, which is correlated to the dynamics of the basilar membrane, can be used as a non-invasive tool not only to diagnose the intracochlear damage but also to interpret these data given its idiosyncratic origin.
