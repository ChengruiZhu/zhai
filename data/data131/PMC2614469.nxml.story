Protegrins are small peptides with strong antimicrobial properties, believed to kill bacteria primarily by forming nonselective pores in the bacterial membrane. This nonspecific and highly effective mechanism of action has created significant excitement about the use of protegrins as therapeutic antibiotics. However, a lack of understanding of the fundamental processes that lead to pore formation and bacterial death has proven to be a major bottleneck in the rational design of protegrin-based antibiotics. In the present work, we have carried out computational investigations of the diffusion of ions through a protegrin pore. We have thereby provided a connection between previous experimental and simulation work aimed at elucidating the structure of the protegrin pore and earlier experimental work investigating the ion transport characteristics of protegrin pores. The ion diffusion characteristics of protegrin pores are likely to be important in their ability to kill bacteria, as the uncontrolled flow of ions through a bacterial membrane will result in membrane depolarization and the loss of vital membrane functions. The present work thus represents an important first step in modeling and quantifying the timeline of events that lead to the killing of bacteria by protegrins. Furthermore, the computational tools that we have presented herein are easily extendible to similar systems, in particular other antimicrobial peptides.
