The Scottish Government Joint Improvement Team (JIT) and the Scottish Centre for Telehealth (SCT), now merged as the Scottish Centre for Telehealth and Telecare (SCTT), published an Education and Training Strategy for Telehealthcare in Scotland in March 2010. In implementing the Strategy’s dedicated Carers Workstream, the SCTT has been working with Carers Scotland and other carer organisations to promote awareness of the benefits of telehealth and telecare in helping to support unpaid carers. Following on from research undertaken by the University of Leeds into the benefits of telecare for carers, developments to date includes the publication of a Training Toolkit for professionals and carer organisations to assist with raising awareness of the benefits of telehealth and telecare specifically for unpaid carers. The toolkit includes outline training programmes, handouts, digital stories and case studies which all adaptable for local use. The presentation will provide an overview of the broader strategic carers’ agenda in relation to telehealth and telecare service delivery, an in-depth look at the Carers and Telehealthcare Training Toolkit and an update on an exciting new technology project to support young carers, being developed in collaboration with Princess Royal Trust for Carers, Glasgow Caledonian and Edinburgh Universities.
