-chromen-2-one was synthesized and characterized by spectroscopic studies. The computed and experimental results of NMR study are tabulated. The dielectric relaxation studies show the existence of molecular interactions between MBDC and alcohol. Theoretical results of MBDC molecules provide the way to predict various binding sites through molecular modeling and these results also support that the chromen substitution is more active in the entire molecule. Molecular docking study shows that MBDC binds well in the active site of tankyrase and interact with the amino acid residues. These results are compared with the anti cancer drug molecule warfarin derivative. The results suggest that both molecules have comparable interactions and better docking scores. The results of the antiproliferative activity of MBDC and Warfarin derivative against MCF-7 breast cancer and HT-29 colon cancer cell lines at different concentrations exhibited significant cytotoxicity. The estimated half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC 50) value for MBDC and Warfarin derivative was 15.6 and 31.2 μg/ml, respectively. This enhanced cytotoxicity of MBDC in MCF-7 breast cancer and HT-29 colon cancer cell lines may be due to their efficient targeted binding and eventual uptake by the cells. Hence the compound MBDC may be considered as a drug molecule for cancer.
