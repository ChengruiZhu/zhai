Our analysis included 125 TN1 patients and 38 TN2 patients with initial VAS scores ≥ 3 treated at 16 community radiotherapy centers. Median Dmax for both cohorts was 75 Gy with a larger range for TN1 cases (67.42 Gy - 110.29 Gy) as compared to TN2 cases (70.00 Gy - 78.48 Gy). At initial follow-up, mean VAS scores after SRS were significantly lower for TN1 and TN2 patients (p < 0.0001). The vast majority of TN1 (87.2%) and TN2 (86.8%) patients experienced initial pain relief. Higher initial VAS scores (p = 0.015) were correlated with a greater likelihood of initial treatment success for TN1 patients. We did not identify any treatment or patient characteristics that had significant effects on initial pain relief for TN2 patients. Of the TN1 cohort, 28 of 125 patients reported follow-ups one year or greater after SRS. Twenty-three of 28 TN1 patients (82%) reported VAS scores of 1 or less at one-year follow-up, and eight of 11 patients (72%) had VAS scores of 1 or less at the two-year follow-up. No potential prognostic factors for long-term pain relief were significant. Roughly 18% and 11% of TN1 and TN2 patients, respectively, experienced acute toxicities (all RTOG Grade 1 or 2), with the most common being sensory neuropathy, generalized pain, and nausea. Dmax > 75 Gy was not a predictor of toxicity incidence in TN1 cases (p = 0.597) but was significant for TN2 patients (p = 0.0009 following Fisher's exact test).
