Surgical accesses for the facial skeleton are based on the concept of modular osteotomies. Various techniques and combination of osteotomies facilitate access to the most inaccessible tumors of craniomaxillofacial region. Most appropriate surgical access is determined by considering size, location, extension of the tumor, and experience of the surgical team. These are primarily used for tumors in the nasopharynx or the skull base. The aim of this paper is to review surgical accesses that aid in removal of inaccessible tumors of craniomaxillofacial region with series of cases operated in the Department of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery, Armed Forces Medical College, Pune, India, between July 2008 and June 2010. The surgical approaches constituted of transfacial, transoral, lip-split mandibulotomy and modified osteotomy of the orbital rim in cases of juvenile nasoangiofibroma, squamous cell carcinoma of the base of the tongue, orbital floor tumour respectively. Only 3 cases (33.33%) reported with postoperative paresthesia of the infraorbital region and mandibular symphysis region which resolved in 6 months. None of the patients presented with occlusal discrepancy, neuromotor deficit or sign of recurrence in the follow up period of one year.
