Cardiovascular disease has become the leading cause of morbidity and mortality in India during the last 3 decades. The genetic predisposition and acquisition of traditional risk factors at a rapid rate as a result of urbanization seems to be the major cause. While efforts are being made to contain this epidemic by educating public and applying preventive measures, the ever increasing burden of patients with symptomatic and life threatening manifestations of the disease is posing a major challenge. This requires a concerted effort to develop modern facilities to treat these patients. The healthcare facilities to manage these high risk patients by contemporary methods like percutaneous coronary revascularization and surgical methods have shown a very promising trend during the last decade. The facilities of modern diagnostic methods and new proven techniques to offer symptomatic relief and improve their prognosis are available in most parts of the country. The lack of social security and health insurance for the large majority of the population, however, is a serious limitation. Unregulated availability of some of the newer devices for these techniques had become a very concerning issue. However, in the last few years serious efforts have been made to streamline these procedures. Indigenous research and scientific data acquisition in relation to the modern technology for achieving coronary revascularization has also started on a promising note.
