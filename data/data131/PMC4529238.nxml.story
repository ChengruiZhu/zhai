Changes to cognition and other central nervous system (CNS) effects following charged particle exposures are of concern for medical patients undergoing radiation treatment in cancer therapy and for cosmic ray exposures to astronauts during space travel. Neuronal cell injury initiated by ionizing energy deposition involves a cascade of physico-chemical and patho-physiological pathways that are poorly understood. Neurons have diverse structural compartmental geometries, including the cell soma, dendrites, and spines. The intricate network of cellular connections requires the study of radiation damage to neuronal morphological features in understanding cellular injury and possible changes in cognitive function. This paper for the first time describes the spatial dependence of a particleâ€™s microscopic dose deposition events on a detailed neuron structure. Heavy ions including iron, carbon and hydrogen particles, and energetic electrons that are common in space radiation exposures are considered. The computational model covers the stochastics of the generation of energy deposition events, delivery of particle beams and possible encounter schemes of microscopic dose and neuronal morphology.
