, has been prepared from a great variety of cells, mainly animal but also plant and bacterial. A chromosin is derived from the cell nucleus. In the course of preparation precautions have been taken to prevent contamination by cytoplasmic constituents. To assure the nuclear origin of all components of chromosin, nuclei have in several instances been isolated before extraction was begun. Because of the precautions taken, chromosins do not contain detectable quantities of ribose nucleoproteins; but, incidentally, extraction of ribose nucleoproteins, free of desoxyribose compounds, has also been described in this paper. A typical chromosin contains 3 components: desoxyribose nucleic acid, histone, and non-histone protein. The nucleic acid, being highly polymerized, is exceedingly viscous when dissolved and fibrous when precipitated. Histone and non-histone protein differ from each other in a number of ways, of which one of the most definite is that whereas a histone contains no more than traces of tryptophane, the non-histone protein of chromosin contains nearly 1 per cent of tryptophane. In neutral physiological saline both proteins can combine with nucleic acid. With the isolation of chromosins from so many different kinds of cells, it can now be seen that (contrary to the view expressed by Kossel) histones are present in most animal cells and at least in some plant and bacterial cells. Chromosin prepared from the Type III pneumococcus is active in transforming the type of a pneumococcus culture. It has been pointed out that it is not yet known whether or not protein is a necessary constituent of the transforming agent. To extract chromosin from a cell
