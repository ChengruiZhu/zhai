Information on the outcomes was not available for 26% of the babies at 12 months, which may limit the accuracy of these findings. Nevertheless, these findings suggest that IPTp with MQ was not associated with any increased risk of undernutrition, illness, or death among infants compared to IPTp with SP. The poorer performance on three psychomotor development milestones among the children born to women given MQ may be due to multiple testing rather than to true differences between the groups of infantsâ€”as more outcomes are investigated in a randomized trial, it becomes more likely that the intervention groups will differ on at least one outcome by chance. It might therefore be worth investigating psychomotor development further in children whose mothers have been exposed to MQ during pregnancy. Although the lower tolerability of MQ compared to SP for pregnant women in this trial that was reported previously means that MQ is unlikely to be used for IPTp, these findings are important because antimalarial regimens containing MQ are recommended for malaria treatment during pregnancy and MQ alone is recommended for malaria prevention in pregnant women traveling to countries affected by malaria.
