Ligand-gated ion channels play a crucial role in controlling many physiological and pathophysiological processes. Deciphering the gating kinetics of these channels is thus fundamental to understanding how these processes work. ATP-gated purinergic P2X receptors (P2XRs) are prototypic examples of such channels. They are ubiquitously expressed and play roles in numerous cellular processes, including neurotransmission, inflammation, and chronic pain. Seven P2X subunits, named P2X1 through P2X7, and several splice forms of these subunits have been identified in mammal. The receptors are organized as homo- or heterotrimers, each possessing three ATP-binding sites that, when occupied, lead to receptor activation and channel opening. The P2XRs are non-selective cation channels and the gating properties differ between the various receptors. Previously, we have used biophysical and mathematical modeling approaches to decipher the kinetics of homomeric P2X2aR, P2X2bR, P2X4R, and P2X7R. Here we extended our work on P2X4R gating. We developed two mathematical models that could capture the various patterns of ionic currents recorded experimentally and explain the particularly complex kinetics of the receptor during orthosteric activation and allosteric modulation. This was achieved by designing a computationally efficient, inference-based fitting algorithm that allowed for parameter optimization and model comparisons.
