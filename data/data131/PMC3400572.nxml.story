Pyramidal neurons (PNs) are the principal neurons of the cerebral cortex and therefore lie at the heart of the brain's higher sensory, motor, affective, memory, and executive functions. But how do they work? In particular, how do they manage interactions between the classical “driver” inputs that give rise to their basic response properties, and “contextual” inputs that nonlinearly modulate those responses? It is known that PNs are contacted by thousands of excitatory synapses scattered about their dendrites, but despite decades of research, the “rules” that govern how inputs at different locations in the dendritic tree combine to influence the cell's firing rate remain poorly understood. We show here that two excitatory inputs contacting the same dendrite interact in an asymmetric nonlinear way that depends on their absolute and relative locations, where the resulting spectrum of location-dependent synaptic interactions constitutes a previously unknown form of spatial analog computation. In addition to suggesting a possible substrate for classical-contextual interactions in PN dendrites, our results imply that the computing functions of cortical circuits can only be fully understood when the detailed map of synaptic connectivity – the cortical connectome – is known down to the subdendritic level.
