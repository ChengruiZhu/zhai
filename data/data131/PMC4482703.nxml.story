Cells suffer from various environmental stresses such as heat shock and viral infection. In response to a stress, small non-membranous cytoplasmic aggregates, stress granules (SGs), are assembled. SGs contain mRNAs and related proteins. Hippocampal CA1 neurons located in the brain, which are vulnerable to ischemia, do not assemble SGs, while CA3 neurons, which are resilient to ischemia, assemble SGs. The dysfunction of SGs has been reported in human diseases including pathogenic viral infection. These observations led to a hypothesis that SGs play an important role in cell fate decisions, and the dynamics of SG assembly would regulate cell fate. However, the conditions that determine the number and distribution of SGs in a cell in response to a stress are largely unknown. We approached this problem by experiments and simulations. Our stochastic simulations replicated the observations. Furthermore, we found that initial steps in the SG assembly process were important to the dynamics of SG assembly, and that SG size resembled the gamma distribution both in simulations and experiments, suggesting the existence of multiple steps in the SG assembly process. To the best of our knowledge, this work was the first to show SG assembly in a whole cell by stochastic simulations.
