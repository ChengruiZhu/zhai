Identification of residues responsible for a specific function of a protein can provide clues about the mechanism of action. Computational approaches to identifying functional residues have emerged as low-cost alternatives to experimental methods by providing fast and large-scale analyses. Moreover, the demand for such approaches is increasing as more sequences become available from genome sequencing projects. Here, we focus on the use of CRESCENDO to identify functional residues in proteins of known structure by comparing the amino acid substitutions observed in a family of proteins with those predicted on the basis of the protein structure. CRESCENDO uses Environment Specific Substitution Tables, or ESSTs, which define the way that accepted amino acid substitutions are influenced by the local structural environment. We describe how the calculation of ESSTs can be improved by using only amino acids that are not involved in catalytic activity, metal or ligand binding, nucleic acid or protein interactions, and other molecular functions. Our new substitution table can better describe the degree of amino acids substitutions that are under structural restraints. It should be of value in all applications of ESSTs, including their use in sequenceâ€“structure homology recognition, structure validation, and structure prediction in addition to their use in the identification of functional residues. These approaches should enhance the understanding of protein structure and function, which is critically important in the postgenomic era.
