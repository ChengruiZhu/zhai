 harbors intracellular bacterial symbionts in its posterior body region, the trophosome region, accounting for up to 50% of the volume. Following decapitation of this flatworm, we have analyzed the behavior of the amputated fragments and any anterior and posterior regeneration. Using an EdU-pulse-chase/BrdU-pulse thymidine analog double-labeling approach combined with immunohistochemistry, we show that neoblasts are the main drivers of the regeneration processes. During anterior (rostrum) regeneration, EdU-pulse-chase-labeled cells aggregate inside the regenerating rostrum, whereas BrdU pulse-labeling before fixation indicates clusters of S-phase neoblasts at the same position. In parallel, serotonergic nerves reorganize and the brain regenerates. In completely regenerated animals, the original condition with S-phase neoblasts being restricted to the body region posterior to the brain is restored. In contrast, no posterior regeneration or growth of the trophosome region in anterior fragments cut a short distance posterior to the brain has been observed. Our data thus reveal interesting aspects of the cellular processes underlying the regeneration of the emerging catenulid-bacteria symbiosis model
