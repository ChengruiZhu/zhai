 reactions and cell-based assays. Using the biosensor that was cell-impermeable because of its size and also by other relevant methods, we determined that exceedingly low levels, if any, of cell-surface furin are present in the intact cells and in the cells with the enforced furin overexpression. This observation was in a sharp contrast with the existing concepts about the furin presentation on cell surfaces and anthrax disease mechanism. We next demonstrated using cell-based tests that PA83, in fact, was processed by furin in the extracellular milieu and that only then the resulting PA63 bound the anthrax toxin cell-surface receptors. We also determined that the biosensor, but not the conventional peptide substrates, allowed continuous monitoring of furin activity in cancer cell extracts. Our results suggest that there are no physiologically-relevant levels of cell-surface furin and, accordingly, that the mechanisms of anthrax should be re-investigated. In addition, the availability of the biosensor is a foundation for non-invasive monitoring of furin activity in cancer cells. Conceptually, the biosensor we developed may serve as a prototype for other proteinase-activated biosensors.
