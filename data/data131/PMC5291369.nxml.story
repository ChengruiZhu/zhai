Numerous research subjects are exposed to unsafe and/or ineffective treatments in unsuccessful drug development programs. Yet, even successful drug development programs can involve heavy burdens for research subjects. In this manuscript, we measure risks and benefits for research subjects participating in the successful development of the anticancer drug sorafenib (first approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration in 2005). After discovering the first two cancer types responding to sorafenib, drug developers and researchers tested sorafenib against many other cancer types and in combination with many other drugs. We find that researchers were able to discover the utility of sorafenib for the first two cancer types quickly and with very little patient burden. Thereafter, attempts to extend the clinical application of sorafenib to other cancers and drug combinations involved many patients and adverse events and were mostly fruitless. We also find that many studies pursued after the first approval of sorafenib returned limited scientific information because they were duplicative or insufficiently informative. Our findings suggest that even successful drug development programs can entail substantial patient burden; they also point to ways that regulators, researchers, and policymakers can improve the risk-benefit ratio for research subjects.
