Consisting of a silica core surrounded by a thin gold shell, nanoshells possess an
optical tunability that spans the visible to the near infrared (NIR) region, a region where light penetrates tissues deeply. Conjugated with tumor-specific antibodies, NIR-absorbing immunonanoshells can preferentially bind to tumor cells. NIR light then heats the bound nanoshells, thus destroying the targeted cells. Antibodies can be consistently bound to the nanoshells via a bifunctional polyethylene glycol (PEG) linker at a density of ~150 antibodies per nanoshell. In vitro studies have confirmed the ability to selectively induce cell death with the photothermal interaction of immunonanoshells and NIR light. Prior to incubation with anti-human epidermal growth factor receptor (HER2) immunonanoshells, HER2-expressing SK-BR-3 breast carcinoma cells were seeded alone or adjacent to human dermal fibroblasts (HDFs). Anti-HER2 immunonanoshells bound to HER2-expressing cells resulted in the death of SK-BR-3 cells after NIR exposure only within the irradiated area, while HDFs remained viable after similar treatment since the immunonanoshells did not bind to these cells at high levels. Control nanoshells, conjugated with nonspecific anti-IgG or PEG, did not bind to either cell type, and cells continued to be viable after treatment with these control nanoshells and NIR irradiation.
