Macrophages are immune cells that form the first line of defense against pathogens, but also mediate tissue damage in inflammatory disease. Macrophages initiate inflammation by recognising and responding to components of bacterial cells. Macrophages of the wall of the gut are constantly replenished from the blood. Upon entering the intestine, newly-arrived cells modulate their response to stimuli derived from the bacteria in the wall of the gut. This process fails in chronic inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD). Both the major forms of IBD, Crohnâ€™s disease and ulcerative colitis, run in families. The inheritance is complex, involving more than 200 different regions of the genome. We hypothesised that the genetic risk of IBD is associated specifically with altered regulation of genes that control the development of macrophages. In this study, we used the comprehensive transcriptome dataset produced by the FANTOM5 consortium to identify the sets of promoters and enhancers that are involved in adaptation of macrophages to the gut wall, their response to bacterial stimuli, and how their functions are integrated. A reanalysis of published genome-wide association data based upon regulated genes in monocytes as candidates strongly supports the view that susceptibility to IBD arises from a primary defect in macrophage differentiation.
