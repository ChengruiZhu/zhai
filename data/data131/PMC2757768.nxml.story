 on the extent of capillarization of myocardial tissue. We exploit this advantage to test four hypotheses. (1) In trabeculae from either ventricle, a peripheral annulus of cells is devoid of capillaries. (2) Hence, sufficiently small trabeculae from either ventricle are totally devoid of capillaries. (3) The capillary-to-myocyte ratios in specimens from either ventricle are identical to those of their respective walls. (4) Capillary-to-myocyte ratios are comparable in specimens from either ventricle, reflecting equivalent energy demands in vivo, driven by identical contractile frequencies and comparable wall stresses. We applied confocal fluorescent imaging to trabeculae in cross section, subsequently using semi-automated segmentation techniques to distinguish capillaries from myocytes. We quantified the capillary-to-myocyte ratios of trabeculae from both ventricles and compared them to those determined for the ventricular free walls and septum. Quantitative interpretation was furthered by mathematical modeling, using both the classical solution to the diffusion equation for elliptical cross sections, and a novel approach applicable to cross sections of arbitrary shape containing arbitrary disposition of capillaries and non-respiring collagen cords.
