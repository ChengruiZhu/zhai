A total of 226 samples of maize and 59 of wheat from the 2004–2007 harvests were investigated for the presence and concentration of deoxynivalenol (DON). Samples of the 2004 harvest were analyzed after their storing for one year in barns, while those of the 2005–2007 harvest were taken directly off fields immediately after the harvest. The samples were analyzed by liquid chromatography on an ODS Hypersil column with DAD detector and ELISA methods. The average incidence rate of DON in maize from the 2004 harvest was 50% (concentration range 0.042–2.460 mg/kg, average value 0.536 mg/kg), while for those of the 2005–2007 harvest it was 32.4% (concentration range 0.027–2.210 mg/kg, average value 0.223 mg/kg). In the case of wheat incidence rate of DON for 2004 harvest was 50.0% (concentration range 0.630–1.840 mg/kg, average value 1.235 mg/kg), while for those of the 2005–2007 harvest it was 34.5% (concentration range 0.057–0.423 mg/kg, average value 0.190 mg/kg). Concentrations in two samples of maize and one of wheat (one sample of each cereal being of the 2004 harvest) were above the maximum level adopted by the European Commission. The results obtained were analyzed as a function of climatic conditions and compared with those of the neighboring countries where the relevant data existed.
