Graphene oxide (GO) is a nanomaterial with newly developing biological applications. Autophagy is an intracellular degradation system that has been associated with the progression of neurodegenerative disorders. Although induction of autophagic flux by GO has been reported, the underlying signaling pathway in neurodegenerative disorders and how this is involved in neuroprotection remain obscure. We show that GO itself activates autophagic flux in neuronal cells and confers a neuroprotective effect against prion protein (PrP) (106–126)-mediated neurotoxicity. GO can be detected in SK-N-SH neuronal cells, where it triggers autophagic flux signaling. GO-induced autophagic flux prevented PrP (106–126)-induced neurotoxicity in SK-N-SH cells. Moreover, inactivation of autophagic flux blocked GO-induced neuroprotection against prion-mediated mitochondrial neurotoxicity. This is the first study to demonstrate that GO regulates autophagic flux in neuronal cells, and that activation of autophagic flux signals, induced by GO, plays a neuroprotective role against prion-mediated mitochondrial neurotoxicity. These results suggest that the nanomaterial GO may be used to activate autophagic flux and could be used in neuroprotective strategies for treatment of neurodegenerative disorders, including prion diseases.
