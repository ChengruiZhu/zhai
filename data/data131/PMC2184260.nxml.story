A new cell surface antigenic system of the mouse, designated G(RADA1), is described. The antigen is defined by cytotoxic tests with the A strain X-ray-induced leukemia RADA1 and naturally occurring antibody from random-bred Swiss mice and can be distinguished from all other serologically detected cell surface antigens of the mouse. Absorption tests indicate that G(RADA1) is present in the normal lymphatic tissue and leukemias of mouse strains with high spontaneous leukemia- incidence, e.g., AKR, C58, and C3H/Figge. Low leukemia-incidence strains, e.g., C57BL/6, BALB/c, and A lack G(RADA1) in their normal tissues, but a proportion of leukemias and solid tumors arising in these strains are G(RADA1)+. The relation of G(RADA1) to MuLV is shown by G(RADA1) appearance after MuLV infection of permissive cells in vitro; four of five N-tropic MuLV isolates, one of four B-tropic MuLV, and none of four xenotropic MuLV induce G(RADA1). Two MCF MuLV, thought to represent recombinants between N-ecotropic and xenotropic MuLV, also induce G(RADA1). Serological and biochemical characterization indicates that G(RADA1) is a type-specific determinant of the gp70 component of certain MuLV. The presence of natural antibody to RADA1 in various mouse strains and the emergence of G(RADA1)+ leukemias and solid tumors in mice of G(RADA1)- phenotype suggest widespread occurrence of genetic information coding for this antigen.
