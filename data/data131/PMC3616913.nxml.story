For sexual reproduction, meiosis is an essential step ensuring the formation of haploid gametes from diploid precursors of the germline. This reduction in the genome's content is achieved through a specialized type of division, where a single round of DNA replication is followed by two successive rounds of chromosome segregation. The first round separates the homologs. For this to faithfully occur, homologous chromosomes pair with each other and experience recombination, catalyzed by the formation of programmed double-strand breaks (DSBs). Upon their repair, a subset of DSBs will generate crossovers, which result from an intermediate that creates a physical link between homologs and allows their correct segregation by the meiotic spindle. DSBs, as well as crossovers, do not occur randomly along chromosomes but at preferential places called hotspots. To ask if all DSB hotspots also give rise to high crossover frequency, we have systematically compared the map of DSBs with that of a protein, Zip3, which we show preferentially binds to DSB sites that are being repaired with a crossover. We discovered that several DSB hotspots rarely produce crossovers, meaning that the decision to repair a DSB with a crossover can be influenced by specific chromosomal features.
