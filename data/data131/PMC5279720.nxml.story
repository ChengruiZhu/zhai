In many developing systems, chemical gradients control the formation of segmental domains of gene expression, specifying distinct domains that go on to form different tissues and structures, in a concentration-dependent manner. These gradients are noisy however, raising the question of how sharply delineated boundaries between distinct segments form. It is crucial that developing systems be able to cope with stochasticity and generate well-defined boundaries between different segmented domains. Previous work suggests that cell sorting and cellular plasticity help sharpen boundaries between segments. However, it remains unclear how effective each of these mechanisms is and what their role in sharpening may be. Motivated by recent experimental observations, we construct a hybrid stochastic model to investigate these questions. We find that neither mechanism is sufficient on its own to sharpen boundaries between different segments. Rather, results indicate each has its own strengths and weaknesses, and that they work together synergistically to promote the development of precise, well defined segment boundaries. Formation of segmented rhombomeres in the zebrafish hindbrain, which later form different components of the central nervous system, is a motivating case for this study.
