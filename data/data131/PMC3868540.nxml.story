Cell identity is determined by differential gene expression, which in turn is controlled by the combined activity of proximal and distal regulatory elements such as enhancers. DNA within active enhancer elements is marked by a hypomethylated state as a result of transcription factor (TF) binding. Here, using CTCF as an example for a DNA-binding factor, we explore the relationship between binding and DNA methylation at the level of single molecules by enriching for CTCF occupied DNA. To our surprise, methylation at molecules which are bound by CTCF does not differ from the average methylation levels at the binding sites defined by whole-genome bisulfite sequencing. We find that binding strength inversely correlates with DNA methylation within the CTCF motif with heterogenic methylation levels at low occupancy sites, suggesting that CTCF can bind to molecules with different methylation states. Moreover, we observed enrichment of 5-hydroxymethylcytosines at constitutive and cell-type specific TF binding sites indicative of an active demethylation process. To test the requirement of TF binding for the observed hydroxymethylation, and as CTCF deletion is incompatible with the survival of embryonic stem cells, we made use of cells in which REST â€“ a factor which was previously shown to be involved in LMR formation - was genetically deleted. This deletion leads to loss of hydroxymethylation at its binding sites, suggesting that binding is necessary for turnover. Our data support a model in which TF occupancy mediates a continuous turnover of DNA methylation during maintenance and formation of active regulatory regions.
