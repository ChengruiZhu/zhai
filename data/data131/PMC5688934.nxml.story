Accumulating evidences suggest that longnon-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) play functional roles in development of different cancers, including cancer initiation and progression. Metastasis associated lung adenocarcinoma transcript 1(MALAT1) is a well-known lncRNA which was previously shown to be a direct target of miR-125b in bladder cancer (BCa) and to promote cancer progression and invasion. However, little is known whether MALAT1 can also target miR-125b. In the present study, using CRISPR-based technologies and qRT-PCR, we show that MALAT1 is capable of suppressing mature miR-125b and increasing the expression of its target genes (Bcl-2 and MMP-13), but has no effect on pri-miR-125b and pre-miR-125b. We observe that the biotin-labeled MALAT1-RNA probe is able to pull down Ago2 and miR-125b and that the negative regulation of miR-125b by MALAT1 is dependent on Ago2. Importantly, the results of flow cytometry assay and transwell assay reveal that the MALAT1-mediated cancer progression is in part due to specific suppression of miR-125b and activation of its two target genes. All together, these data suggest that the “MALAT1-miR-125b-Bcl-2 / MMP-13” axis plays an important role in the progression of BCa, thereby may provide a potential therapeutic strategy for the treatment of human BCa.
