Adipose tissue remodeling occurs in obesity, characterized by adipocyte hypertrophy and increased infiltration of macrophages which also shift to a proinflammatory phenotype. Factors derived from these macrophages significantly alter adipocyte function, such as repressing adipogenesis, inducing inflammatory response and desensitizing insulin action. As macrophages produce a cocktail of inflammatory signals, identifying the key factors that mediate the detrimental effects may offer effective therapeutic targets. IL-1β, a major cytokine produced largely by macrophages, is implicated in the development of obesity-associated insulin resistance. In this article, we discuss recent advances in our understanding of the role of IL-1β in macrophage-adipocyte crosstalk in obesity. IL-1β impairs insulin sensitivity in adipose tissue by inhibition of insulin signal transduction. Blocking the activity of IL-1β, its receptor binding or production improves insulin signaling and action in human adipocytes. This is in parallel with a reduction in macrophage-stimulated proinflammatory profile and lipolysis. Targeting IL-1β may be beneficial for protecting against obesity-related insulin resistance at the tissue and systemic levels.
