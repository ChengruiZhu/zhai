Gallbladder carcinoma (GBC) possesses a poor prognosis, which is primarily attributed to the lack of early and timely surgical intervention. Calpain-1 and glypican-3 have been implicated in the progression of various types of cancer. The present study aimed to detect the expression of calpain-1 and glypican-3 in GBC, and analyzed whether the expression levels of these proteins correlated with any clinicopathological variables. A total of 100 patients with GBC and 30 patients with cholecystitis who accepted surgical treatment were enrolled in the present study. Pathological and clinical data were obtained from all patients. The expression of calpain-1 and glypican-3 was detected in paraffin-embedded tissues by immunohistochemistry. Calpain-1 expression was manually assessed with an immunohistochemical H-score with a slight modification. Glypican-3 expression was assessed as negative and positive. The correlations between protein expression and clinicopathological characteristics, and the associations between the proteins were analyzed. All patients exhibited positive expression of calpain-1. Notably, the high expression rate of calpain-1 was significantly increased in patients with GBC, compared with patients with cholecystitis (32.0 vs. 6.7%; Ï‡
