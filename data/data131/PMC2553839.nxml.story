One of the key molecules that modulate longevity in evolutionarily diverse organisms is the transcription factor DAF-16/FOXO. Despite its importance in aging and other biological processes, how DAF-16/FOXO activity is regulated in the nucleus is largely unknown. We report a new player important for aging modulation, the nematode homolog of host cell factor 1 (HCF-1), and show that it functions as a negative regulator of DAF-16. In worms, HCF-1 inactivation extends lifespan up to 40% and increases resistance to specific stress stimuli. To affect lifespan and stress response, HCF-1 requires the activity of DAF-16. We show that the HCF-1 protein is expressed in the nucleus and partners with DAF-16 in worms. Furthermore, we demonstrate that loss of HCF-1 results in elevated levels of DAF-16 at the promoters of its target genes and altered expression of a subset of DAF-16-regulated genes. We propose that HCF-1 modulates longevity and stress response by binding to DAF-16 and preventing the transcription factor from accessing its target gene promoters, thereby regulating the expression of DAF-16 target genes. As HCF-1 is highly conserved, our findings have important implications for aging and FOXO regulation in humans.
