Gold nanoparticles (GNPs) are often used as colloidal carriers in numerous applications owing to their low-cost and size-controlled preparation as well as their straightforward surface functionalization with thiol containing molecules forming self-assembling monolayers (SAM). The quantification of the ligand density of such modified GNPs is technically challenging, yet of utmost importance for quality control in many applications. In this contribution, a new method for the determination of the surface coverage of GNPs with thiol containing ligands is proposed. It makes use of the measurement of the gold-to-sulfur (Au/S) ratio by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP–MS) and its dependence on the nanoparticle diameter. The simultaneous ICP–MS measurement of gold and sulfur was carefully validated and found to be a robust method with a relative standard uncertainty of lower than 10%. A major advantage of this method is the independence from sample preparation; for example, sample loss during the washing steps is not affecting the results. To demonstrate the utility of the straightforward method, GNPs of different diameters were synthesized and derivatized on the surface with bifunctional (lipophilic) ω-mercapto-alkanoic acids and (hydrophilic) mercapto-poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG)
