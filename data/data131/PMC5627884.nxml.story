The nonsyndromic cleft is one of the most frequent congenital defects in humans. Clinical data demonstrated improved and almost scarless neonatal healing of reparative surgery. Based on our previous results on crosstalk between neonatal fibroblasts and adult keratinocytes, the present study focused on characterization of fibroblasts prepared from cleft lip tissue samples of neonates and older children, and compared them with samples isolated from normal adult skin (face and breast) and scars. Although subtle variances in expression profiles of children and neonates were observed, the two groups differed significantly from adult cells. Compared with adult cells, differences were observed in nestin and smooth muscle actin (SMA) expression at the protein and transcript level. Furthermore, fibroblast to myofibroblast differentiation drives effective wound healing and is largely regulated by the cytokine, transforming growth factor-β1 (TGF-β1). Dysregulation of the TGF-β signalling pathway, including low expression of the TGF-β receptor II, may contribute to reducing scarring in neonates. Fibroblasts of facial origin also exhibited age independent differences from the cells prepared from the breast, reflecting the origin of the facial cells from neural crest-based ectomesenchyme.
