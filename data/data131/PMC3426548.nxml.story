Kallmann syndrome is a hereditary developmental disease that affects both the hormonal reproductive axis and the sense of smell. There is a developmental link between the reproductive and olfactory disorders: neuroendocrine cells producing the gonadotropin-releasing hormone that is deficient in the patients normally migrate from the nose to the forebrain along olfactory nerve fibers during embryonic life, and they fail to do so in the patients. Affected individuals usually do not undergo spontaneous puberty. Hormone replacement therapy is the treatment to initiate virilization in males or breast development in females and later to develop fertility in both sexes. This is a genetically heterogeneous disease. Mutations in any of eight causative genes identified so far have been found in approximately 30% of the affected individuals, thus indicating that other genes remain to be discovered. We report on the identification, in 6% of the KS patients, of various loss-of-function mutations in the gene coding for semaphorin-3A, a secreted protein involved in the navigation of olfactory nerve fibers during embryogenesis. The fact that many of these mutations were also detected in clinically unaffected individuals indicates that they must combine with other genetic defects to produce the disease phenotype.
