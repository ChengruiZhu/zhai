Osteochondromas are common tumors of the long bones, but are rare in the craniofacial region. We detailed two different management of osteochondroma of the mandibular condyle treated utilizing three-dimensional (3D) imaging and computer-assisted planning. Simultaneous open temporomandibular joint and orthognathic surgeries were done to treat both the pathology and secondary facial asymmetry. An osteochondroma that presented as a bony mass at the lateral aspect of the left mandibular condyle of a 24-year-old Chinese female was treated with simultaneous orthognathic surgery and conservative excision. No recurrence was detected 7 months postsurgery. An osteochondroma that presented as a generalized enlargement of the right mandibular condyle of a 25-year-old Chinese male was treated with simultaneous orthognathic surgery and condylectomy. There were no significant issues 3 years postsurgery. Simultaneous orthognathic and temporomandibular joint surgeries are a viable option for the management of osteochondroma of the mandibular condyle. The availability of 3D imaging enabled better presurgical examination of the lesion, which directed treatment toward condylectomy or conservative excision.
