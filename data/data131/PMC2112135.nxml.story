Stress fiber-like patterns are visualized by indirect immunofluorescence in scleroblasts (fibroblasts) in situ on the scale of the common goldfish, Carassius auratus, using an affinity-purified antiactin, antimyosin, and anti-alpha-actinin. These fibers demonstrate the classical convergent and parallel patterns exhibited by stress fibers in tissue culture cells. Because the dimensions, the composition, and the pattern of distribution of these cytoplasmic fibers correspond well with those of stress fibers in cultured cells, we will call these fibers stress fibers also. The staining patterns with anti-alpha-actinin and antimyosin along the stress fibers often reveal a periodicity of 1-2 microM, identical to that found in cells in vitro. The majority of scleroblasts do not exhibit stress fiber staining and they are specifically located in the central regions of the scale. Stress fibers are present in scleroblasts residing on or near the edges or radical ridges of the scale. They are consistently orientated perpendicular to these structures; however, unlike microtubules, stress fibers show no co-alignment with collagen fibers of the scale. The finding that stress fibers are located in regions of the scale more subject to shearing forces may indicate their role in increased cellular adhesion to the substratum.
