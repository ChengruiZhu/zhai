Accurate transmission of information in the nervous system requires the precise formation of contact points between neurons. Regulation of these contact sites involves fine tuning the number and branching of dendritic processes on neurons. Throughout development, several secreted factors act to regulate dendrite number and branching. One important family of these factors is neurotrophins, which are indispensable for the survival and development of neurons. For example, stimulation of hippocampal neurons with one neurotrophin, brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), increases the number of dendrites directly extending from the cell body. Here, we report that BDNF-stimulated dendritic growth requires phosphorylation of the BDNF receptor, TrkB, by a kinase known as cyclin-dependent kinase 5 (Cdk5). Inhibiting phosphorylation of TrkB by Cdk5 essentially abolishes the induction of dendrites by BDNF. Our observations reveal that Cdk5 serves as a regulator of neurotrophin function. Since Cdk5 and neurotrophins both play essential roles in neuronal development, our findings suggest that the interplay between Cdk5 and TrkB may also be implicated in the regulation of other biological processes during development.
