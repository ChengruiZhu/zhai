Direct stimulation of single muscle fibers from Xenopus laevis at a frequency of 1 Hz results in a decline of the peak isometric twitch tension after about 200 twitches. Fibers were chemically fixed in glutaraldehyde after a varying number of twitches and at several fatigue levels, and the ultrastructural appearance was compared with that of resting fibers treated by identical fixation methods. No gross structural abnormalities were observed but subtle changes occurred. The mitochondria of stimulated fibers contain granules of normal size and number. The inner crista width is constant but the matrix width is increased on stimulation. These changes would not compromise ATP production. The myofibrils are normal except for a slight swelling in the myosin lattice. The transverse system (T system) and sarcoplasmic reticulum are intact. The minor diameter of the transverse tubule (T tubule) is increased slightly in stimulated fibers. The gap between the T-TC membranes stays constant at about 110 A, but tiny connecting pillars are seen to cross this gap more frequently in stimulated fibers (21 +/- 5% triads) than in resting fibers (8 +/- 6%). In stimulated fibers there is a marked increase in the electron dense content of the terminal cisternae (TC). Inasmuch as the observed structural changes correlate with the number of twitches but not with the fatigue level, it is concluded that TC density and T-TC pillar formation are related to the normal mechanisms of excitation-contraction coupling.
