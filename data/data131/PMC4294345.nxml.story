 profile. IGF-1 is a major survival factor in MM regulating the expression of Bcl-2 proteins and might therefore be a resistance factor to these ABT-analogous. We first show that IGF-1 protected human MM cell lines (HMCLs) against ABT-737. Concurrently, the IGF-1 receptor inhibitor picropodophyllin (PPP) synergistically sensitized HMCL, primary human MM and murine 5T33MM cells to ABT-737 and ABT-199 by further decreasing cell viability and enhancing apoptosis. Knockdown of Bcl-2 by shRNA protected MM cells to ABT-737, while Mcl-1 shRNA sensitized the cells. PPP overcame the Bcl-2 dependency of ABT-737, but failed to completely overcome the protective effect of Mcl-1. In vivo, co-treatment of 5T33MM bearing mice significantly decreased tumor burden and prolonged overall survival both in a prophylactic and therapeutic setting. Interestingly, proteasome inhibitor resistant CD138âˆ’ 5T33MM cells were more sensitive to ABT-737, whereas PPP alone targeted the CD138+ cells more effectively. After co-treatment, both subpopulations were targeted equally. Together, the combination of an IGF-1R inhibitor and an ABT-analogue displays synergistic anti-myeloma activity providing the rational for further (pre)clinical testing.
