A common concern within HIV prevention is that HIV positive MSMW do not disclose their HIV status to female partners who are thus at increased risk for HIV infection. The present study uses unique data to examine whether MSMW disclose more often to male rather than female partners. Data were collected on most recent male and/or female primary partner and four most recent casual partners from 150 MSMW (50 African American, 50 Latino, 50 White). MSMW reported on 590 partners (31% female; 69% male). Disclosure was coded as disclosure before sex, disclosure after sex, or nondisclosure. A series of multinomial logistic regressions with partners clustered within respondents were conducted to evaluate effects of respondent characteristics and partner characteristics on timing of disclosure. In bivariate and multivariate analyses there were no significant differences in odds of disclosure to male and female partners before or after sex. Although MSMW were substantially less likely to disclose to HIV negative partners before sex compared to HIV positive partners regardless of sex, when we fully interacted the multivariate model by partner sex, the odds of disclosure to HIV negative male partners compared to HIV positive male partners before sex were significantly higher than the odds of disclosure to HIV negative female partners compared to HIV positive female partners. Patterns of mutual nondisclosure and nonreciprocal disclosure were observed with both primary and casual partners. The paper makes additional methodological contributions to the measurement and analysis of disclosure.
