The death rates were lower (p = 0.003) in the thrombolysis therapy group with an incidence ratio of 0.57 (95% CI 0.39-0.83). 113 (8.8%) patients (53 women) received thrombolysis. They were significantly younger (69.2 ± 12.7 vs. 73.9 ± 12.5 years; p < 0.001), had higher NIHSS score (12.7 ± 6.3 vs. 7.3 ± 7.0; p < 0.001), spent more days in hospital (10.4 ± 8.3 vs. 8.3 ± 7.9; p < 0.001), and had a higher average Barthel score at discharge (85.5 ± 24.4 vs. 79.2 ± 28.6; p = 0.023). The male/female incidence ratio showed a significant decrease (p = 0.01) in the incidence of mortality in women and a better Barthel score. The thrombolysis improved the survival in the overall group with thrombolysis versus without thrombolysis (p = 0.028), in women versus in men with thrombolysis (p = 0.023), and in women with thrombolysis versus in those without thrombolysis (p < 0.001) but not in men with thrombolysis versus in those without thrombolysis (p = 0.743). The protective factors as regards mortality were thrombolysis therapy (95% CI 0.37-0.80; p = 0.002), Barthel score ≥60 (95% CI 0.81-0.94; p = 0.002), and cardiovascular secondary prevention 1 year after stroke (0.13, 95% CI 0.06-0.28).
