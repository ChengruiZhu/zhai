A number of laboratory studies of speciation have uncovered individual genes that confer lower fitness when in a divergent genetic background. It is, however, unclear whether these genes were ever relevant to restricting gene flow in nature, or whether they are indirect consequences of functional divergence between species that in most cases can no longer hybridize in natural conditions. Analysis of introgression across the genome of divergent populations provides an alternative approach to determine the genetic basis of reproductive isolation. Using two subspecies of rabbits as a model for the early stages of speciation, we provide a genome-wide map of genetic differentiation. Our study revealed important aspects of the genetic architecture of differentiation in the early stages of divergence and allowed the identification of genomic regions that resist introgression and are likely to confer reproductive barriers in natural conditions. The gene content of these regions, which in several cases reached gene-level resolution, suggests an important role for epigenetic and transcription regulation in the maintenance of reproductive barriers. Some of the genes identified here in a natural system are similar in function to the hybrid male sterility genes identified in laboratory studies of speciation.
