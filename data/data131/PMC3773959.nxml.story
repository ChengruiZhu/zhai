Hypothyroidism is a well-known complication following treatment of laryngeal or hypopharyngeal carcinomas, and may cause various psychological and physical problems that negatively affect quality of life. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of substitution therapy on symptoms in patients with hypothyroidism. A study-specific questionnaire on physical and psychological problems (before and after substitution therapy) was sent to 70 patients who had been treated between 1977 and 2008 with clinical or subclinical hypothyroidism. Ninety-four percent returned the questionnaire. Symptoms on energy levels were reported most often (67% always tired and 70% lack of energy). Moodiness and emotional and physical symptoms were reported more often in substituted (sub)clinical hypothyroidism. Substitution therapy resulted in an improvement of energy (P = 0.013), sense of general interest and enjoyment (P = 0.022) and a reduction of puffy face (P = 0.041). Most symptoms in patients with thyroid dysfunction do not improve after substitution therapy. Nevertheless, due to its impact on health-related quality of life and the low burden of substitution therapy, screening for hypothyroidism and subsequent substitution therapy remains important.
