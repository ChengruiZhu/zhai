Monocytes and myeloid derived suppressor cells (MDSC) have been implicated on the regulation of tumor growth. Histamine is also important for regulating MDSC responses. Oral administration of the H2 receptor antagonist ranitidine can inhibit breast tumor growth and metastasis. In the current study, we examined the impact of oral ranitidine treatment, at a clinically relevant dose, on multiple murine tumor models. The impact of ranitidine on monocyte responses and the role of CCR2 in ranitidine-induced tumor growth inhibition were also investigated. Oral ranitidine treatment did not reduce tumor growth in the B16-F10 melanoma, LLC1 lung cancer and EL4 thymoma models. However, it consistently reduced E0771 primary tumor growth and metastasis in the 4T1 model. Ranitidine had no impact on E0771 tumor growth in mice deficient in CCR2, where monocyte recruitment to tumors was limited. Analysis of splenic monocytes also revealed an elevated ratio of H2 versus H1 expression from tumor-bearing compared with na√Øve mice. More detailed examination of the role of ranitidine on monocyte development demonstrated a decrease in monocyte progenitor cells following ranitidine treatment. Taken together, these results reveal that H2 signaling may be a novel target to alter the monocyte population in breast tumor models, and that targeting H2 on monocytes via oral ranitidine treatment impacts effective tumor immunity. Ranitidine is widely used for control of gastrointestinal disorders. The potential role of ranitidine as an adjunct to immunotherapies for breast cancer and the potential impact of H2 antagonists on breast cancer outcomes should be considered.
