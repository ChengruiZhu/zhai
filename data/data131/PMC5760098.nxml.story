, the pumping movement of a feeding organ called the pharynx has been subjected to intensive genetic studies. Compared to the factors promoting pumping, however, the inhibitory mechanisms of pumping are less well understood. In this paper, we report that optogenetic silencing of the body wall muscles, which drive the locomotory movement of worms, inhibits pumping in the pharynx. Signals emanating from muscles are likely to trigger pumping inhibition, raising an interesting possibility that the proprioceptive sense detecting the relaxation of body wall muscles might be involved. When the Arch proton pump was activated with weak light, signals for pumping inhibition are transferred into the pharynx mainly through two pathways: one involving gap junction-dependent mechanisms through pharyngeal I1 neurons, which mediate fast signals, and the other involving dense-core vesicle-dependent mechanisms, which mediate slow signals. Strong activation of Arch inhibits pumping very strongly via other mechanisms. Thus, we have revealed a new link between pumping and the body wall muscles, and confirmed the important cooperation of neural and neuroendocrine circuits in the regulation of feeding behaviors.
