Neuroblastoma (NB) is the most common malignant tumor in infancy and most common extracranial solid tumor in childhood. With the improvement of diagnosis and treatment, the survival rate of patients with low-risk and intermediate-risk NB can reach up to 90%. In contrast, for high-risk NBs, the long-term survival rate is still <40% because of heterogeneity of this tumor. The pathogenesis of NB is still not explicit, therefore it is of great significance to explore the mechanism of NB tumorigenesis and discover new therapeutic targets for NB. Polo-like kinase 4 (PLK4), one of the polo-like kinase family members, is an important regulator of centriole replication. The aberrant expression of PLK4 was found in several cancers and a recent study has unraveled a novel function of PLK4 as a mediator of invasion and metastasis in Hela and U2OS cells. However, the function of PLK4 in NB development and progression remains to be elucidated. The study showed the expression level of PLK4 in NB tissues was remarkably upregulated and high expression of PLK4 was negatively correlated with clinical features and survival, which suggested that PLK4 could be a potential tumor-promoting factor of NB. Functional studies indicated downregulation of PLK4 suppressed migration and invasion and promoted apoptosis in NB cells. Further experiments showed that downregulation of PLK4 in NB cells inhibited EMT through the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway. Animal experiments demonstrated that the downregulation of PLK4 in SK-N-BE(2) cells dramatically suppressed tumorigenesis and metastasis. PLK4 may be a promising therapeutic target for NB.
