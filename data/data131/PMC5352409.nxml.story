It has been proved that interleukin-10-knockout (IL-10 KO) mice display the most similar characteristics to that of human Crohn's disease (CD). Docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) has well established beneficial effects on human and animal models health with potent anti-inflammatory effects with poorly understood mechanisms. This study was aimed at figuring out whether DHA could ameliorate the Crohn's colitis by activating GPR120 and whether GPR120 could be a potential therapeutic target for CD.16 week-old mice included in our present study were divided into three groups, WT group, IL-10 KO group and DHA group(IL-10 KO mice with DHA treatment, i.g., 35.5mg/kg/d), containing 8 mice in each group. The severity of colitis, pro-inflammatory cytokines concentrations, the expression/distribution of protein GPR120 and TAK1/IKK-α/IkB-α/p65 pathway in the proximal colons were evaluated at the end of the experiment. Administration of DHA showed promising results in the experimental chronic colitis (demonstrated by reduced infiltration of inflammatory cells, lowered inflammation scores, decreased pro-inflammatory cytokines) and body weight loss improvement. Moreover, in the DHA-treated mice, enhanced expression and improved distribution integrity of protein GPR120 were observed, which was probably associated with the regulation of TAK1/IKK-α/IkB-α/p65 pathway. Our results indicated that triggering GPR120 via the inhibition of TAK1/IKK-α/IkB-α/p65 pathway might be an important target for Crohn's colitis.
