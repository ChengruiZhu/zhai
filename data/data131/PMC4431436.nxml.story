Melanoma remains one of the most aggressive types of cancer with a historically low survival rate. The αvβ3 integrin is involved in the progression of malignant melanoma. In the present study, the efficacy of MK-0429, a selective inhibitor of the αvβ3 integrin, was evaluated for its potential in the prevention of melanoma metastasis. Female B6D2F1 mice injected via the tail vein with murine B16F10 melanoma developed lung metastases within ~10 days. In the first experiment, the prevention of lung metastasis was assessed in the model treated with either vehicle, MK-0429 at 100 and 300 mg/kg orally twice daily or cyclophosphamide at 300 mg/kg, i.p. once daily. Study endpoints included determination of the study time period to achieve metastasis in lungs in this model, evaluation of the health effects on the study animals, the total number of lung colonies identified and lung tumor area. Unlike cyclophosphamide, the MK-0429 treatment did not lead to a significant weight reduction in mice. MK-0429 at 100 and 300 mg/kg reduced the number of metastatic tumor colonies by 64 and 57%, respectively, and the high dose also reduced the tumor area by 60% as compared to the vehicle. The second experiment employed B16F10 luciferase-expressing cells to examine the
