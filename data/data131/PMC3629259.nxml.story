The aim of this study was to establish a robust and reliable assay for the detection of circulating tumor cells (CTCs) in the peripheral blood (PB) of patients with advanced lung adenocarcinoma. We used real-time reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR) to detect survivin, human telomerase reverse transcriptase (hTERT), cytokeratin-7 (CK-7) and thyroid transcription factor 1 (TTF-1) mRNA expression levels in 68 advanced lung adenocarcinoma patients and 30 healthy patients. Statistical analyses were additionally performed to examine the correlation between the mRNA expression levels of these markers with the clinicopathological features of advanced lung adenocarcinoma patients. The sensitivity of these four mRNA markers in the PB of advanced lung adenocarcinoma patients was 41.18, 61.76, 41.18 and 35.29%, respectively. The sensitivity of these four markers combined was 82.35%, which was significantly higher compared with single marker detection. Statistical analysis demonstrated that high expression levels of survivin, hTERT and TTF-1 mRNA are positively correlated with lymph node classification, and high expression levels of survivin, hTERT, CK7 and TTF-1 mRNA are positively correlated with distant metastasis (P<0.05). In addition, overexpression of these four mRNA markers is positively correlated with disease progression (P<0.05). Our data suggest that the combination of survivin, hTERT, CK-7 and TTF-1 mRNA markers may provide a valuable tool for CTC detection and is associated with disease progression in advanced lung adenocarcinoma patients.
