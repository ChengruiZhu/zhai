Recent evidences prove that, release of potent lysosomal enzymes e.g. β-Glucuronidase by degranulation of polymorponuclear leukocytes in host gingiva may contribute significantly to tissue destruction and the pathogenesis of periodontal disease. The purpose of the present study was to compare and correlate GCF β-Glucuronidase with periodontal status among diabetic and non-diabetic patients with chronic periodontitis. A total number of 75 patients were equally divided into Group I (control group), Group II (non diabetic with chronic periodontitis) and Group III (diabetic with chronic periodontitis). Clinical parameters like Plaque index, Gingival index, Probing Pocket Depth and RBS were recorded. The β-Glucuronidase level in GCF of all three groups was determined by spectrophotometric analysis. It was observed that the periodontitis patients irrespective of their diabetic status, showed increased periodontal destruction with elevated level of β-Glucuronidase than the controls. Also, the diabetic patients showed increased severity of periodontal destruction and the elevated level of β-Glucuronidase, thus indicating diabetics at a higher risk for progressive periodontal destruction.
