Chromosome instability leads to the accumulation of chromosome number and structure aberrations that have been suggested as necessary for neoplastic transformation. Telomeres, specialized DNAâ€“protein complexes localized at the physical ends of linear chromosomes, are crucial for maintaining chromosome stability. Massive chromosomal instability may occur when cells continuously proliferate in the absence of specific telomere elongation mechanisms. Besides telomere dysfunction, it has been suggested that a transient phase of tetraploidization has a causative role in cancer. This study provides a link between dysfunctional telomeres and the generation of tetraploids. Using a human mammary epithelial cell model, we show that diploid cells exhibiting progressive telomere dysfunction, in a p53 proficient background, engender tetraploid cells through cytokinesis failure. Our studies give new insights into the mechanisms that may facilitate the evolution of malignant phenotypes: telomere-dependent chromosome instability would engender tetraploid intermediates that, on division, would promote further cellular genome remodelling, which is needed at the early stages of tumour development in order for cells to become neoplasic.
