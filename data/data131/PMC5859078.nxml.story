We and others have demonstrated that stimulants such as methamphetamine (METH) exerts immunosuppressive effects on the hostâ€™s innate and adaptive immune systems and has profound immunological implications. Evaluation of the mechanisms responsible for T-cell immune dysregulation may lead to ways of regulating immune homeostasis during stimulant use. Here we evaluated the effects of METH on T cell cycle entry and progression following activation. Kinetic analyses of cell cycle progression of T-cell subsets exposed to METH demonstrated protracted G1/S phase transition and differentially regulated genes responsible for cell cycle regulation. This result was supported by in vivo studies where mice exposed to METH had altered G1 cell cycle phase and impaired T-cell proliferation. In addition, T cells subsets exposed to METH had significant decreased expression of cyclin E, CDK2 and transcription factor E2F1 expression. Overall, our results indicate that METH exposure results in altered T cell cycle entry and progression. Our findings suggest that disruption of cell cycle machinery due to METH may limit T-cell proliferation essential for mounting an effective adaptive immune response and thus may strongly contribute to deleterious effect on immune system.
