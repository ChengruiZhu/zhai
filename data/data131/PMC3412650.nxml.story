Ovarian cancer is a major cause of death among women; there remains an urgent need to develop new effective therapies to target this cancer. Phosphoprotein enriched in astrocytes (PEA-15) is a 15-kDa phosphoprotein that is known to bind ERK1/2, thus blocking cell proliferation. The physiological activity of PEA-15 is dependent on the phosphorylation status of serine 104 (Ser104) and Ser116. However, little is known about the impact of PEA-15 phosphorylation on tumor progression. We have previously shown that overexpression of PEA-15 has an antitumor effect against both breast and ovarian cancer cells. Here, we report that using a human ovarian cancer tissue microarray, we found that tissues from patients with ovarian cancer were significantly more likely than adjacent normal tissues to express PEA-15 phosphorylated at both sites. Using phosphomimetic and nonphosphorylatable mutants of PEA-15, we found that mutant double-unphosphorylated PEA-15 in which Ser104 and Ser116 were substituted with alanine (PEA-15-AA) had a more potent antitumorigenic effect in ovarian cancer than did phosphomimetic PEA-15 in which Ser104 and Ser116 were substituted with aspartic acid (PEA-15-DD). Further, we observed that the antitumorigenic effect of PEA-15-AA was a result of inhibition of the migration capacity of cells and inhibition of
