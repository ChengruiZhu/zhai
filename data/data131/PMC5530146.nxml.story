Squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) is the most common epidermal malignancy, and Wnt/β-catenin signaling is frequently activated in SCC. Resveratrol prevents rodent epidermal carcinogenesis, while its effect on human epidermal cancer remains unknown. To address this issue, the impact of resveratrol on the growth and Wnt signaling of skin SCC Colo16 cells were investigated at the cellular and molecular biology levels by flow cytometry, immunocytochemistry, reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction, western blotting and β-catenin-specific small interfering RNA (siRNA) transfection. Resveratrol (100 µM) suppressed cell growth and induced apoptosis in Colo16 cells. Wnt2 and its downstream genes were downregulated, which was accompanied by increased expression of the Wnt signaling inhibitor Axin2. Transfection with a β-catenin-specific siRNA did not affect cell growth but enhanced the resveratrol susceptibility of Colo16 transfectants. The present results suggest the inhibitory effects of resveratrol on epidermal SCCs and inactivation of Wnt signaling as one of the resveratrol-caused molecular events in Colo16 cells. β-catenin oriented siRNA is insufficient to induce cell crisis, implicating the presence of more critical cancer-associated element(s) as the target in Colo16 cells.
