Cystic fibrosis is an autosomal recessive disorder caused by mutations of the CF transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR), which acts as a chloride channel and also participates in the regulation of other ions and proteins. In most CF patients, the clinical course is dominated by lung disease and recurrent pulmonary bacterial infections. Many CF patients also have significant skeletal muscle wasting and weakness, and this can affect the most essential breathing muscle, the diaphragm. Although muscle wasting in CF has generally been attributed to factors such as reduced physical activity and poor nutrition, our study reveals an intrinsic defect of skeletal muscle function caused by the lack of CFTR. Hence, we show that CFTR is normally found in skeletal muscle fibers of humans and mice. In CF muscle cells lacking CFTR, abnormal elevations of calcium and inflammatory gene expression are found. In addition, during pulmonary infections, diaphragm muscles lacking CFTR show greater weakness and induction of genes which cause muscle atrophy. These findings extend our understanding of the factors leading to exercise limitation and disability in CF and also have implications for the pathogenesis of respiratory muscle failure in CF patients during lung infections.
