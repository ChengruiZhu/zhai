Purpose: The study aims at detecting risk factors for developing peripheral neuropathy in Romanian HIV infected subjects. Material/Methods: retrospective study (january 1990-january 2009) who analyzed data from patients hospitalized in the Regional Center Craiova. We have compared 26 patients (group N) diagnosed with peripheral neuropathy  with 40 patients (group C) without neuropsychological sufferings, randomly selected. We have analysed: age, height, HIV mode of transmission, AIDS status, the average and nadir of CD4 lymphocytes, the mean viral load, the average duration of antiretroviral treatment (ART), use and duration of use of d-drugs, the presence of certain coinfection, diabetes or ethanol abuse. Results: the following differences were statistically significant: age (31,54±14,64 vs 23,9±12,03 years, p=0.024), HIV mode of transmission  (parenteral/sexual: 13/13 vs 28/8, p = 0.044), the monitoring time duration (5,31±3,77 vs 7,75±5,4 years, p=0.043), median ART duration (37,2±9,66 vs 45,12±8,75 months, p=0.001). Close to the threshold of statistical significance are the CD4 nadir (97,33±65,6 vs 123,15±43,35 cells/mm3, p=0.058) and duration of use of d–drugs (22,5±31,94 vs 12,24±8,6 months, p=0.057). Odds ratio (OR) and relative risk (RR) increase with age. ROC analysis for the study group establishes a threshold difference of 29 years (sensitivity 50%, specificity 80%). Conclusions: higher age and advanced immunosupression are the most important risk factors for developing symptomatic peripheral neuropathy in Romanian HIV infected patients; taking into account the small number of cases studied, although not statistically significant, it should be noted the CD4 nadir and the length of d-drug use.
