TGFβ1 is the most pleiotropic of all known cytokines and thus, to avoid uncontrolled TGFβ-activated processes, its activity is tightly regulated. Studies in fibrosis have led to the discovery that αv integrins are the major regulators of the local activation of latent TGFβ in our tissues. Since all cells can express one or more types of αv integrins, this raises the possibility that, in the complex milieu of a developing cancer, multiple cell types including both cancer cells and stromal cells activate TGFβ. In normal tissues, TGFβ1 is a tumour suppressor through its ability to suppress epithelial cell division, whereas in cancer, in which tumour cells develop genetic escape mechanisms to become resistant to TGFβ growth suppression, TGFβ signalling creates a tumour-permissive environment by activating fibroblast-to-myofibroblast transition, by promoting angiogenesis, by suppressing immune cell populations and by promoting the secretion of both matrix proteins and proteases. In addition, TGFβ drives epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) increasing the potential for metastasis. Since αv integrins activate TGFβ, they almost certainly drive TGFβ-dependent cancer progression. In this review, we discuss the data that are helping to develop this hypothesis and describe the evidence that αv integrins regulate the TGFβ promotion of cancer.
