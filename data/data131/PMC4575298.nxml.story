Poorly controlled diabetes mellitus (DM) is associated with the development of long-term micro- and macro-vascular complications. The predominant focus of anti-diabetic therapy has been on lowering glycosylated haemoglobin levels, with a strong emphasis on fasting plasma glucose (particularly in Type 2 DM). There is considerable evidence indicating that post-meal hyperglycaemic levels are independently associated with higher risks of macro-vascular disease. Although some have identified mechanisms which may account for these observations, interventions which have specifically targeted postprandial glucose rises showed little or no effect in reducing cardiovascular risk. Clinical experience and some recent studies suggest acute hyperglycaemia affects cognition and other indicators of performance, equivalent to impairment seen during hypoglycaemia. In this brief report, we evaluated the published studies and argue that acute hyperglycaemia is worth investigating in relation to the real-life implications. In summary, evidence exists suggesting that acute hyperglycaemia may lead to impaired cognitive performance and productivity, but the relationship between these effects and daily activities remains poorly understood. Further research is required to enhance our understanding of acute hyperglycaemia in daily life. A better appreciation of clinically relevant effects of acute hyperglycaemia will allow us to determine whether it needs to be addressed by specific treatment.
