Inside the nucleus, DNA is wrapped into a complex molecular structure called chromatin, whose fundamental unit is âˆ¼150 bp of DNA organized around the eight-histone protein complex known as the nucleosome. Understanding the local organization of nucleosomes is critical for understanding how chromatin impacts gene regulation. Here, we describe a computational model that predicts nucleosome placement from DNA sequence. We train the model using data derived from human cell lines, and we apply the model systematically to 1% of the human genome. We show that previously described models trained from yeast data correlate strongly with the human-trained model, suggesting a common mechanism for sequence-based determination of nucleosome occupancy. In addition, we observe a striking complementarity between models trained using data from weakly and strongly digested samples: one type of model recognizes nucleosome-free regions, whereas the other identifies well-positioned nucleosomes. Finally, our analysis of predicted nucleosome positions in the human genome allows us to identify common features of nucleosome-forming and inhibitory sequences. Overall, our results are consistent with the classical statistical positioning theory of nucleosome organization.
