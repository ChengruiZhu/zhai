In the Chinese subset of the GIANT study, a total of 11,377 patients were included in the intention-to-treat/safety population. At the end of the initial treatment period, improvement and recovery from infection was observed for 98.6% (n = 11,217/11,377) and 92.6% (n = 10,540/11,377) of all patients. After 1 week of treatment, 76.3% (n = 8681/11,377) of patients had recovered. Median time until improvement and recovery was 3.0 and 6.0 days, respectively. Correspondingly, in 95.8% (n = 10,903/11,377) of all patients, overall effectiveness during the initial treatment period with MXF was assessed as “very good” or “good”. Compared with the last AECB, the number of days with impact on daily-life activities and the number of nights with sleep disturbances decreased from 3.0 to 2.0 (median) and from 2.0 to 1.0 (median), respectively. In general, MXF treatment was very well tolerated, with physician’s overall assessment of tolerability as “good” or “very good” in 95.2% (n = 10,834/11,377) of patients. The incidence rate of adverse events and adverse drug reactions was 0.82% (n = 93) and 0.67% (n = 76), respectively. The most frequent adverse events were gastrointestinal disorders such as nausea (0.31%, n = 35) and vomiting (0.19%, n = 22), which were mostly drug-related. One individual serious adverse event (dyspnea) occurred during the observation period, which was assessed as drug-related.
