Discovering miRNA-disease associations promotes the understanding towards the molecular mechanisms of various human diseases at the miRNA level, and contributes to the development of diagnostic biomarkers and treatment tools for diseases. Computational models can make the discovery more efficient and experiments more productive. LRSSLMDA was proposed to computationally infer potential miRNA-disease associations via adopting sparse subspace learning with Laplacian regularization on the known miRNA-disease association network and the informative feature profiles extracted from the integrated miRNA/disease similarity networks. Experimental results in global and local leave-one-out cross validation and 5-fold cross validation showed a superior prediction performance of LRSSLMDA over previous models. Moreover, three types of case studies on five important human diseases were carried out to further demonstrate the modelâ€™s predictive power: respectively, 98%, 88%, 96%, 98% and 98% out of the top 50 predicted miRNAs were confirmed by experimental literatures. So, we believe that LRSSLMDA could make reliable predictions and might guide future experimental studies on miRNA-disease associations.
