We report here that FcR for human monomeric IgG1 can be induced on cells of myeloid origin cultured in the presence of IFN gamma for 8 h. Supernatant fluids from cultures of lymphocytes infected with a variety of viruses or cocultured with cell lines have the same FcR enhancing effect as IFN gamma. We identify the factor in the supernatant fluid responsible for the induction as immune interferon. Among the different types of IFN, only the gamma type (both purified and recombinant) specifically induces the appearance of FcR for monomeric IgG1 on normal and leukemic myeloid cells but not on cells of lymphoid origin. This effect is also evident on mature PMN. We show that the specificity and the affinity of the receptor induced on HL-60 promyelocytic cells, peripheral blood monocytes, and PMN are identical to those of the receptor spontaneously present on the same cells, except for PMN, which do not spontaneously express this type of receptor. The results of inhibition experiments performed with mouse IgG of and IgG3. These results suggest that the receptor present on human monocytes different isotypes indicate that the receptor can be inhibited by murine IgG2a or immature myeloid cells, selectively inducible by IFN gamma, has a specificity similar to the FcR1 described on mouse macrophages.
