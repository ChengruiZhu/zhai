Functional and morphological alterations of the intestinal epithelial barrier (IEB) have been consistently reported in digestive disorders such as irritable bowel syndrome and inflammatory bowel disease. There is mounting evidence that Parkinsonâ€™s disease (PD) is not only a brain disease but also a digestive disorder. Gastrointestinal involvement is a frequent and early event in the course of PD, and it may be critically involved in the early development of the disease. We therefore undertook the present survey to investigate whether changes in the IEB function and/or morphology occur in PD. Colonic biopsies were performed in 31 PD patients and 11 age-matched healthy controls. The para- and transcellular permeability were evaluated by measuring sulfonic acid and horseradish peroxidase flux respectively, in colonic biopsies mounted in Ussing chambers. The expression and localization of the two tight junctions proteins ZO-1 and occludin were analyzed by Western blot and immunofluorescence, respectively. The para- and transcellular permeability were not different between PD patients and controls. The expression of occludin, but not ZO-1, was significantly lower in colonic samples from PD patients as compared to controls and the cellular distribution of both proteins was altered in colonic mucosal specimens from PD patients. Our findings provide evidence that the IEB is morphologically altered in PD and further reinforce the potential role of the gastrointestinal tract in the initiation and/or the progression of the disease.
