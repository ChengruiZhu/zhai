The delivery of therapeutic proteins has gained momentum with development of biotechnology. However, large molecular weight, hydrophilic nature and susceptibility to harsh environment of gastrointestinal tract (GIT) resulted in low absorption. The main objective of this work was the design of a particulate system for oral delivery of recombinant human growth hormone (rhGH) on the basis of particle uptake mechanism in GIT. Biodegradable protein-loaded microspheres were prepared using Resomers (RG207, RG756 and RG505) by double emulsion methods. Aqueous solution of protein and freshly prepared rhGH-zinc complex were used for loading process. Various analytical methods, including fluorescence spectroscopy, SDS-PAGE electrophoresis and reversed-phase chromatography, were set up for the quantification and qualification of rhGH before and after the formulation and fabrication procedures. At the optimum conditions, microspheres were mostly below 10 Î¼m with relatively high protein loading (> 50%). Obtained data showed that the stability of protein did not change during the formulation and microencapsulation processes. Results also showed that the encapsulation process in the presence of zinc caused no detectable change in the protein chemical stability.
