Knowledge of potential tumor markers may improve chemotherapeutic efficacy. Interleukin-6 (IL-6) expression in local tumor tissues is associated with cancer progression and poor prognosis in variety of cancer types. The aim of the present study was to investigate the role and potential application of IL-6 in determining the prognosis of esophageal carcinoma. KYSE170 and TE13 esophageal cancer cell lines were used to conduct cell- and animal-based experiments investigating biological changes and tumor behavior. Immunohistochemical analysis revealed that 70â€“80% of cancer cells exhibited positive staining for IL-6, compared with <15% of non-malignant epithelial cells. These immunohistochemical results were consistent with the mRNA expression levels detetced. The IL-6 silencing vector significantly reduced invasion and proliferation of the two cell lines and attenuated tumor growth in xenograft mouse models (P<0.05). The IL-6 silencing vector markedly reduced the presence of Ki-67 (a typical proliferation marker) and microvessel density, indicating that downregulation of IL-6 levels may greatly affect tumor growth and inhibition. The IL-6 silencing vector increased E-cadherin and matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-9 expression levels in the two esophageal carcinoma cell lines. This vector also regulated the release of IL-6 in cell supernatant and serum in KYSE170- and TE13-tumor-bearing mice. The secretion of vascular endothelial growth factor and cluster of differentiation 31 (a nuclear protein) immunoreactive molecules were also reduced by the IL-6 silencing vector. Therefore, IL-6 may be an important trigger in the progression of angiogenesis and endothelial tube formation within the tumor, and targeting IL-6 may be a promising strategy for the treatment of esophageal cancer.
