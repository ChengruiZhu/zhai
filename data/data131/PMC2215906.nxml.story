A suspension of olfactory epithelial cells was prepared from porcine olfactory mucosa and the physiological functions of the suspension were examined. The membrane potential of the cell suspension, which was monitored by measuring the fluorescence changes of rhodamine 6G, was depolarized by an increase in the K+ concentration in the external medium. Various odorants depolarized the cell suspension in a dose- dependent fashion. The magnitude of depolarization by odorants was either unchanged or slightly increased by a reduction of the concentration of Na+, Ca2+, and Cl- in the external medium, which suggests that changes in the permeabilities of specific ions are not involved in depolarization by odorants. The application of various odorants to the cell suspension induced changes in the membrane fluidity at different sites of the membrane that were monitored with various fluorescent dyes [8-anilino-1-naphthalene sulfonate, n-(9- anthroyloxy) stearic acids, 12-(9-anthroyloxy) oleic acid, and (1,6- diphenyl-1,3,5-hexatriene)], which suggests that the odorants having different odors are adsorbed on different sites in the membrane. On the basis of these results, a possible mechanism of odor discrimination is discussed.
