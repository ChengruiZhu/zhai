The present study aimed to determine the mechanisms of action of curcumin in osteosarcoma. Human osteosarcoma U-2 OS cells was purchased from the Cell Bank of the Chinese Academy of Sciences. RNA sequencing analysis was performed for 2 curcumin-treated samples and 2 control samples using Illumina deep sequencing technology. The differentially expressed genes were identified using Cufflink software. Enrichment and protein-protein interaction network analyses were performed separately using cluster Profiler package and Cytoscape software to identify key genes. Then, the mRNA levels of key genes were detected by quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) in U-2 OS cells. Finally, cell apoptosis, proliferation, migration and invasion arrays were performed. In total, 201 DEGs were identified in the curcumin-treated group. EEF1A1 (degree=88), ATF7IP, HIF1A, SMAD7, CLTC, MCM10, ITPR1, ADAM15, WWP2 and ATP5C1, which were enriched in ‘biological process’, exhibited higher degrees than other genes in the PPI network. RT-qPCR demonstrated that treatment with curcumin was able to significantly increase the levels of CLTC and ITPR1 mRNA in curcumin-treated cells compared with control. In addition, targeting ITPR1 with curcumin significantly promoted apoptosis and suppressed proliferation, migration and invasion. Targeting ITPR1 via curcumin may serve an anticancer role by mediating apoptosis, proliferation, migration and invasion in U-2 OS cells.
