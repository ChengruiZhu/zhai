Influenza A viruses are important human and animal pathogens. Seasonal influenza viruses cause infections every year, and occasionally zoonotic viruses emerge to cause pandemics with significantly higher morbidity and mortality rates. Three cases of laboratory confirmed human infection with avian influenza A (H7N9) virus were reported in 2013, and there have been several cases reported across South East Asia, and recently in North America. Most patients experience severe respiratory illness, with mortality rates approaching 40%. No vaccine is currently available and the use of antivirals is complicated due to the emergence of drug resistant strains. Thus, there is a need to identify new drugs for therapeutic intervention and disease control. In humans, following H7N9 infection, there is excessive expression of pro-inflammatory factors CCL2, IL-6, IL-8, IFNα, interferon-γ, IP-10, MIG and macrophage inflammatory protein-1β, which has been shown to contribute to fatal disease outcomes in mouse models of infection. In the current study, the potent inhibitor of CCL2 synthesis, Bindarit, was examined as a countermeasure for H7N9-induced inflammation in a mouse model. Bindarit treatment of mice did not have any substantial therapeutic efficacy in H7N9 infection. Consequently, the results suggest that Bindarit may be ill-advised in the treatment of influenza H7N9 infection.
