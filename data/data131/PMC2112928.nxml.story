In the preceding papers, we demonstrated that the endogenous phosphorylation of a 29,000-dalton protein is stimulated in response to secretagogue application to intact cells from the rat exocrine pancreas and parotid and dephosphorylated upon termination of secretagogue action. One- and two-dimensional gel analysis of 32Pi-labeled pancreatic and parotid lobules as well as their respective subcellular fractions revealed that the same protein was covalently modified in both tissues and was localized to the ribosomal fraction. To identify the intracellular second messengers which may mediate or modulate the phosphorylation of the 29,000-dalton protein in intact cells, the effects of Ca2+, cAMP, and cGMP on the endogenous phosphorylation of this protein were assessed in subcellular fractions from the rat pancreas and parotid. Our results demonstrate that the phosphorylation of the 29,000-dalton polypeptide may be regulated by both Ca2+ and cAMP in the pancreas and in the parotid. No cGMP-dependent protein phosphorylation was found in either tissue. As in the in situ phosphorylation studies, the Ca2+- and cAMP-dependent phosphorylation of this same protein was localized to the ribosomal fraction. The cAMP- dependent protein kinase activity was found primarily in the postmicrosomal supernatant in contrast to the Ca2+-dependent protein kinase that appeared to be tightly associated with the substrate in addition to being present in the postmicrosomal supernatant. The data suggest that, in cells from the exocrine pancreas and parotid, secretagogues may regulate the phosphorylation of the 29,000-dalton protein through Ca2+ and/or cAMP.
