Cells in the mammalian hippocampal formation are thought to be central for spatial learning and stable spatial representations. Of the known spatial cells, grid cells form strikingly regular and stable patterns of activity, even in darkness. Hence, grid cells may provide the universal metric upon which spatial cognition is based. However, a more fundamental problem is how grids themselves may form and stabilise, since sensory information is noisy and can vary tremendously with environmental conditions. Furthermore, the same grid cell can display substantially different yet stable patterns of activity in different environments. Currently, no model explains how vastly different sensory cues can give rise to the diverse but stable grid patterns. Here, a new probabilistic model is proposed which combines information encoded by grid cells and boundary cells. This noise-tolerant model performs robust spatial learning, under a variety of conditions, and produces varied yet stable grid cell response patterns like rodent grid cells. Across numerous experimental manipulations, rodent and probabilistic grid cell responses are similar or even statistically indistinguishable. These results complement a growing body of evidence suggesting that mammalian brains are inherently probabilistic, and suggest for the first time that grid cells may be involved.
