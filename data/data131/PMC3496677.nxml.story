Cell migration is a fundamental cellular process required for embryonic development to wound healing and also plays a key role in tumor metastasis and atherosclerosis. Migration is regulated at multiple strata, from cytoskeletal reorganization to vesicle trafficking. In migrating cells, signaling pathways are integrated with vesicle trafficking machineries in a highly coordinated fashion to accomplish the recruitment and trafficking of the trans-membrane proteins toward the leading edge. Different signaling molecules regulate cell migration in different physio-pathological contexts, among them, phosphatidylinositol-4,5-biphosphate (PIP2) is an integral component of the plasma membrane and pleiotropic lipid signaling molecule modulating diverse biological processes, including actin cytoskeletal dynamics and vesicle trafficking required for cell migration. In this commentary, we provide a brief overview of our current understandings on the phosphoinositide signaling and its implication in regulation of cell polarity and vesicle trafficking in migrating cells. In addition, we highlight the coordinated role of PIPKIÎ³i2, a focal adhesion-targeted enzyme that synthesizes PIP2, and the exocyst complex, a PIP2-effector, in the trafficking of E-cadherin in epithelial cells and integrins in migrating cancer cells.
