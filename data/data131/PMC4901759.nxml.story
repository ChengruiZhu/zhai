Ten patients with a mean age of 48 years (range 42 - 61 years) were included in the study. Distal biceps reconstruction was performed using an Achilles tendon allograft in 9 patients and a combination of tibialis anterior allograft and gracilis allograft in 1 patient. Of the reconstructions, 50% involved the dominant arm. Full ROM was observed in all patients at the time of their final follow up assessment. The mean follow-up for dynamometer strength testing was 34 months (range 13-81 months). No statistical differences were noted between data obtained from operative and contralateral extremities. The average peak torque of the operative limb (38.5± 5.9 Nm) was 91.7% of that of the contralateral limb (41.8±4.9 Nm) in flexion and 93.4% (operative, 5.7±1.3 Nm; contralateral, 6.1± 1.0 Nm) in supination. No significant differences were found in fatigue index between operative or contralateral limbs for flexion (operative, 34.1±17.1%; contralateral, 30.8±17.1%; p = 0.29) or supination (operative, 38.2±16.5%; contralateral, 42.1±11.9%; p = 0.65). . The only complication observed was a transient PIN palsy in one patient which resolved by 3 months post-operatively. All patients reported postoperative cosmetic deformity but found their gross appearance acceptable.
