Dr. Mumford was one of the founding members of the AAOS, and was one of eight members listed as attending the business meeting of the Clinical Orthopaedic Society, October 30, 1931, where the concept of a new national organization was discussed [1]. While the record is not entirely clear, Mumford apparently served on the Executive Committee of the AAOS from 1931 (when according to Heck the AAOS was chartered [3]) until 1944, then as President-Elect, President from 1945–1946, and continued on the Executive Committee until 1950 [2]; that being the case, he would have served on the Executive longer than any of the original founders (and perhaps longer than anyone since). He is the only AAOS President to have served two terms: at the written request of the Office of Defense Transportation in 1944, the January, 1945 meeting was canceled, and he remained President during the subsequent year, presiding over the 1946 meeting. He was active in the AOA and the Clinical Orthopaedic Society (he served as Secretary-Treasurer, Vice-President, and President in 1933, the year of the first meeting of the AAOS), as well as the Indianapolis Board of Health, the American College of Surgeons and other organizations. Among all of his many clinical responsibilities and activities in the 1930s, he found time to assume from his father the management of his family’s 5800 acre farm in Indiana.
