Deterioration of the immune system due to antibiotic therapy can be restored by immunomodulator application. In this paper we estimate the effect of ampicillin, amikacin, doxycycline, rifampicin, rifamycine and immunomodulator To≈Çpa Peat Preparation (TPP) on neovascular reaction induced in murine skin by human mononuclear cells (MNC) injection. MNC originating from 15 healthy volunteers were injected intradermally to Balb/c mice. Antibiotics (3, 15, or 75 mg/kg of body weight) alone or with TPP (10 mg/kg of body weight) were administrated subcutaneously to mice on three consecutive days. The number of newly formed blood vessels was measured in dissection microscope 72 hours after cell injection. Results: TPP stimulated angiogenic activity of MNC at the dose 5 and 10 mg/kg. Rifamycine exerted strong stimulatory action, ampicillin slightly stimulated immune response, while doxycycline and rifampicin downregulated it. Amikacin did not influence the results of angiogenesis tests. Studied antibiotics (15 mg/kg), except rifamycine, inhibit the angiostimulatory effect of the tested immunomodulator. TPP should be applied after antibiotic therapy to maintain its stimulatory effect and restore proper host immune function.
