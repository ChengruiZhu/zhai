Gene transcription is regulated by the coordinated interaction of genetic, epigenetic and trans-acting factors. The chromatin environment at gene promoters, including positioned nucleosomes that may display functional histone modifications, is a key regulator of gene expression, contributing to transcriptional activation and repression. In addition to sense-strand transcription of gene sequences, antisense transcription is prevalent at gene promoters. Often resulting in a short-lived non-coding RNA transcript, the function of antisense transcription is poorly understood. Using next-generation sequencing techniques, we characterized transcription in human breast cancer cells and found extensive correlations between antisense transcription and the chromatin environment at promoters. We found that downstream antisense transcription initiates from between regularly positioned nucleosomes and that those nucleosomes between sense and downstream antisense transcription start sites display histone modifications associated with active gene promoters. Chromatin remodelers and other protein complexes responsible for creation and maintenance of the promoter chromatin environment associate with this same region, suggesting an important role of antisense transcription in the regulation of gene expression.
