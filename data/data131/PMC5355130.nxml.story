Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are highly involved in diverse biological processes of human malignancies. The expression profile and underlying mechanism of lncRNA growth arrest specific transcript 5 (GAS5) in colorectal cancer (CRC) is poorly understood. In this study, we found that GAS5 was commonly downregulated in CRC tissues, serum of CRC patients and CRC cell lines. Knockdown of GAS5 promoted CRC cell proliferation and colony formation, whereas overexpression of GAS5 produced the opposite result. We further demonstrated that knockdown of GAS5 increased the expression and secretion of interleukin-10 (IL-10) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF-A) via NF-ÎºB and Erk1/2 pathways. Neutralization of IL-10 and VEGF-A reduced tumour proli feration caused by GAS5 knockdown. Moreover, GAS5 expression showed a statistically significant correlation with the mRNA levels of IL-10 and VEGF-A in CRC tissues. We further illustrated that GAS5 was markedly downregulated and negatively correlated with the cytokine expression in a mouse model of colitis-associated cancer (CAC). These results delineate a novel mechanism of lncRNA GAS5 in suppressing colorectal carcinogenesis. The cytokines IL-10 and VEGF-A inhibited by GAS5 may provide targets for lncRNA-based therapies for CRC.
