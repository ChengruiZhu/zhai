. Because the complexity of a computational design increases dramatically with the number of mutable residues, many design algorithms employ cutoffs (distance or energy) to neglect some pairwise residue interactions, thereby reducing the effective search space and computational cost. However, the energies neglected by such cutoffs can add up, which may have nontrivial effects on the designed sequence and its function. To study the effects of using cutoffs on protein design, we computed the optimal sequence both with and without cutoffs, and showed that neglecting long-range interactions can significantly change the computed conformation and sequence. Designs on proteins with experimentally measured thermostability showed the benefits of computing the optimal sequences (and their conformations), both with and without cutoffs, efficiently and accurately. Therefore, we also showed that a provable, ensemble-based algorithm can efficiently compute the optimal conformation and sequence, both with and without applying cutoffs, by enumerating a small number of conformations, usually fewer than 1000. This provides a novel way to combine cutoffs with provable, ensemble-based algorithms to reap the computational efficiency of cutoffs while avoiding their potential inaccuracies.
