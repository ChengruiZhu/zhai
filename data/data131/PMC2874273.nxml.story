The mean age of the patients was 36.42 ± 5.10 years. Group 1 eyes had a median (range) preoperative uncorrected visual acuity (UCVA) of 0.79 (0.52) and best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) of 0.15 (0.08). Group 2 had a median preoperative UCVA of 0.79 (0.60) and BCVA of 0.15 (0.08). The median postoperative UCVA in Group 1 was 0.17 (0.21) and BCVA was 0.15 (0.13). In Group 2, the median postoperative UCVA was 0.30 (0.32) and BCVA was 0.15 (0.26). Group 1 had a median preoperative refraction of +5.37 (1.75) diopters and the median postoperative refraction at one week was −0.23 (1.25) diopters, at three months was +0.75 (0.75) diopters, and at six months was +0.75 (1.00) diopters. Group 2 had a median preoperative refraction of +5.00 (1.75) diopters, and the median postoperative refraction at one week was +0.13 (1.5) diopters, at three months was +1.00 (0.75) diopters and at six months +1.25 (1.25) diopters. The difference was statistically significant between groups 1 and 2. The difference within each group was also significant. Group 1 eyes were stabilizing after the three-month period in contrast with Group 2 in which the refractive changes continued throughout the follow-up period.
