A 59-year-old male patient with jaundice was referred to our hospital because of mass lesions in the pancreatic head and tail. An immunological examination revealed an elevated serum IgG4 level. Computed tomography showed two clear boundary mass lesions in the pancreatic head and tail. Magnetic resonance imaging showed that the mass lesions exhibited low intensity on T1-weighted images and iso-intensity on T2-weighted images. Magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography showed an obstruction of the main pancreatic duct in the pancreatic head and tail. The possibility of malignant tumors could not be ruled out; therefore, we performed total pancreatectomy. A histopathological examination of the nodular lesions revealed severe lymphoplasmacytic infiltration and inflammatory change around the pancreatic ducts. Immunohistochemistry revealed diffuse infiltration of IgG4-positive plasma cells in the nodules. According to these pathological findings, we diagnosed the patient with IgG4-related multifocal mass lesions of autoimmune pancreatitis (AIP). It is difficult to distinguish between focal type AIP and pancreatic cancer. We herein report a rare case of multifocal mass lesions in AIP and include bibliographical comments.
