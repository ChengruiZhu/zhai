Cisplatin is a DNA-damaging anti-cancer agent that is widely used to treat a range of tumour types. Despite its clinical success, cisplatin treatment is still associated with a number of dose-limiting toxic side effects. The purpose of this study was to clarify the molecular events that are important in the anti-tumour activity of cisplatin, using gene expression profiling techniques. Currently, our incomplete understanding of this drugâ€™s mechanism of action hinders the development of more efficient and less harmful cisplatin-based chemotherapeutics. In this study the effect of cisplatin on gene expression in human foreskin fibroblasts has been investigated using human 19K oligonucleotide microarrays. In addition its clinically inactive isomer, transplatin, was also tested. Dualfluor microarray experiments comparing treated and untreated cells were performed in quadruplicate. Cisplatin treatment was shown to significantly up- or down-regulate a consistent subset of genes. Many of these genes responded similarly to treatment with transplatin, the therapeutically inactive isomer of cisplatin. However, a smaller proportion of these transcripts underwent differential expression changes in response to the two isomers. Some of these genes may constitute part of the DNA damage response induced by cisplatin that is critical for its anti-tumour activity. Ultimately, the identification of gene expression responses unique to clinically active compounds, like cisplatin, could thus greatly benefit the design and development of improved chemotherapeutics.
