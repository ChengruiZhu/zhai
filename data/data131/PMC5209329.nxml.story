Rieske non-heme iron oxygenases, which have a Rieske-type [2Fe–2S] cluster and a non-heme catalytic iron center, are an important family of oxidoreductases involved mainly in regio- and stereoselective transformation of a wide array of aromatic hydrocarbons. Though present in all domains of life, the most widely studied Rieske non-heme iron oxygenases are found in mesophilic bacteria. The present study explores the potential for isolating novel Rieske non-heme iron oxygenases from thermophilic sources. Browsing the entire bacterial genome database led to the identification of 45 homologs from thermophilic bacteria distributed mainly among Chloroflexi, Deinococcus–Thermus and Firmicutes. Thermostability, measured according to the aliphatic index, showed higher values for certain homologs compared with their mesophilic relatives. Prediction of substrate preferences indicated that a wide array of aromatic hydrocarbons could be transformed by most of the identified oxygenase homologs. Further identification of putative genes encoding components of a functional oxygenase system opens up the possibility of reconstituting functional thermophilic Rieske non-heme iron oxygenase systems with novel properties.
