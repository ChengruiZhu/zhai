Bacterial cells constantly communicate with one another by exchanging chemical signals, which constitute a rich source of information about the proximity of friends or foes in the environment. These signals can be used to coordinate the actions of cells across a population. For example, pathogenic bacteria infecting a host can remain quiescent, only becoming virulent once they attain a sufficient cell density. Such coordination, regulated by so-called quorum-sensing systems, works on the following principle: every cell in the population secretes a specific chemical signal; the more cells there are, the more signal is generated; when individual cells sense that the signal has crossed some threshold, they launch a response. The nature of the response depends on the detailed molecular wiring of the secretion and sensing system, which can vary from species to species. It is often impossible to determine all these molecular details for any given system. Borrowing ideas from control theory, we show that this internal wiring can be largely ignored, and these systems can be considered as ‘black boxes’. Our experiments demonstrate that the measured input-output logic of the black box, which we term ‘promoter logic’, is sufficient to predict the diverse responses of different quorum-sensing systems.
