The purpose of the present study was to investigate the association between admission clinical characteristics and outcomes at discharge among acute ischemic stroke patients in the Chinese population. A total of 2,673 patients with acute ischemic stroke were included in the present study. The clinical characteristics at admission and other study variables were collected for all patients. The study outcome was defined as neurological deficiency (National Institute of Health Stroke Scale score ≥10) at discharge or in-hospital death. Compared with the subjects without neurological deficiency at discharge or in-hospital death, the subjects with neurological deficiency at discharge or in-hospital death had a significantly higher prevalence of hyperglycemia or history of atrial fibrillation at admission. Age ≥ 80 years, hyperglycemia, hypertension, and history of atrial fibrillation were significantly associated with neurological deficiency at discharge or in-hospital death after adjustment for other variables. It is concluded that old age (≥80 years), hyperglycemia, hypertension and history of atrial fibrillation are significantly associated with neurological deficiency at discharge or in-hospital death among patients with acute ischemic stroke.
