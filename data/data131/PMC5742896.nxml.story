The posterior nasal nerves emerge from the sphenopalatine foramen and contain sensory and autonomic nerve components. Posterior nasal neurectomy is an effective method to remove pathological neural networks surrounding the inferior turbinate that cause unregulated nasal hypersensitivity with excess secretion in patients with severe allergic rhinitis (AR). We describe the sophisticated endoscopic surgical procedure that allows feasible access to the confined area and selective resection of the nerve branches with the preservation of the sphenopalatine artery (SPA). We retrospectively analyzed the cases of 23 symptomatic severe AR patients who failed to respond to standard medical treatment and underwent surgery. There have been no major complications after surgery including nasal bleeding or transient numbness of the upper teeth. The mean total nasal symptom scores (TNSS) were decreased by 70.2% at 12 months after the procedure. Our comparison of the clinical effectiveness based on the number of severed nerve branches revealed that the improvement of the TNSS was significantly higher in patients with >2 branches. We conclude that this minimally invasive technique that preserves the SPA is clinically useful and decreases the rate of postoperative complications. This trial is registered with
