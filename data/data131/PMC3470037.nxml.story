Custom femoral components have been developed for total hip arthroplasty to maximize cortical form-fit and thereby to reduce the problems of stress shielding and aseptic loosening. Limited information is available about how much endosteal cortical contact can actually be achieved with these expensive implants. The aim of this study was therefore to verify the exact cortical contact of a custom made stem using microsections and comparing it to a standard stem with similar design. In 8 human femurs (3 matched pairs and 2 separate specimens), custom femoral prostheses (Adaptiva; 5 femurs: 3 matched and 2 separate) and conventional femoral prostheses (Alloclassic; 3 matched femurs) were implanted. Endosteal cortical contact was determined from CAD planning drafts and microsections cut from the specimens with a diamond saw. Microsection analysis of the paired femurs showed that contact between prosthesis and bone varied clearly along the length of the femoral stem. Total cortical contact was considerably greater in custom prostheses than conventional prostheses (custom, 47%; conventional, 32%), but markedly less than the total contact predicted by the manufacturer (84% to 90%). The custom prosthesis had more lateral cortical contact on CAD planning drafts (cortical contact: medial, 60%; lateral, 53%) than on specimen microsections after implantation (medial, 64%; lateral, 24%).
