Sixty-seven acute HCV infections were identified among 142 co-infected patients, all of whom were male and 66 (98.5%) were MSM. Median age at diagnosis was 37 (range 20â€“59) and 58 (86.6%) were White British. Sixty patients (89.6%) were genotype 1, 3 (4.5%) were genotype 4 and 2 (3.0%) were genotype 2/3. A further 2 (3.0%) were re-infections. A peak in new HCV diagnoses was seen in 2013 with 17 (25.4%). Route of transmission was sexual in all cases with 13 (19.4%) also injecting drugs, pointing to mixed transmission routes. Nine (69.2%) of these occurred in 2013. Nine (13.4%) patients cleared HCV themselves. Of the 58 who didn't clear HCV, 12 (20.7%) were lost to follow up/transferred care, 4 (6.9%) declined treatment awaiting newer agents, and 10 (17.2%) are waiting to start. A total of 32 patients started treatment. Six (18.8%) patients are currently on treatment and three (9.4%) await a final sustained virological response (SVR) test. Six out of twenty-four (25.0%) stopped treatment due to lack of response and 1 stopped due to side effects. Fifteen (62.5%) achieved SVR and 2 (8.3%) failed to achieve SVR. Eight out of ten (80.0%) patients who had an early virological response (EVR) achieved SVR.
