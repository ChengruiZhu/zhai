To develop an alternative treatment for lung cancer, a combination of two potent chemotherapeutic agents – liposomal apigenin and tyroservatide – was developed. The therapeutic potential of this combination was investigated using A549 cells. Apigenin and tocopherol derivative-containing D-alpha-tocopheryl polyethylene glycol 1000 succinate (TPGS) liposomes might improve the delivery of apigenin to tumor cells, both in vitro and in vivo. Importantly, compared to either agent alone, the combination of apigenin TPGS liposomes and tyroservatide exhibited superior cytotoxicity, induced stronger G2 arrest, and suppressed A549 cancer cell invasion at a lower dose. The proapoptotic synergistic effects were also observed in A549 cells using terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick-end labeling, flow cytometry, and Western blot analysis. More importantly, in vivo results showed that the combination of apigenin TPGS liposomes and tyroservatide exhibited tumor-growth inhibitory effects in A549 cell-bearing mice. In conclusion, our study showed that this combination therapy could serve as a promising synergistic therapeutic approach to improve outcomes in patients with lung cancer.
