The incidence of human papillomavirus (HPV)‐associated (HPV‐positive) head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) of the oropharynx has dramatically increased over the last decade and continues to rise. Newly diagnosed HPV‐positive HNSCCs in the United States currently outnumber any other HPV‐associated cancers, including cervical cancer. Despite introduction of the HPV vaccine, the epidemic of HPV‐positive HNSCC is expected to continue for approximately 60 years. Compared with patients who have tobacco‐associated HNSCC, those who have HPV‐positive HNSCC have better overall survival and response to treatment. Current treatment, including chemotherapy and radiation therapy, is associated with lifelong morbidity, and there are limited treatments and no curative options for patients who develop recurrent metastatic disease. Therapeutic de‐escalation (decreased radiation dose) is being tested through clinical trials; however, those studies select patients based solely on tumor and patient smoking characteristics. Mechanisms of HPV‐driven carcinogenesis in HNSCC are not well understood, which limits new therapeutic strategies and hinders the appropriate selection of patients for de‐escalation therapy.
