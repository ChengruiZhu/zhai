The brains of vertebrates consist mainly of interneuronsâ€”neurons processing information coming from other neurons. Light information is believed to enter the brain through dedicated photoreceptor cells that are distinct from these processing cells, and motorneurons then relay the information to the musculature. Here we analyze two slowly evolving groups of vertebrate photopigment proteins, TMT-opsins and VAL-opsins, and find that both opsins are expressed in interneurons and motorneurons in medaka fish and zebrafish. Although these species diverged from a common ancestor over 300 million years ago and live in different habitats, the opsin localization is highly similar, suggesting a fundamental shared role for these proteins. Cultured cells expressing TMT-opsins respond to light, and electrophysiological recordings on adult brain slices identify a distinct set of light-sensitive interneurons. Based on our work, we argue that endogenous TMT- and VAL-opsin expression confers light-sensitivity on interneurons and motorneurons, and we propose two hypotheses. First, that modern vertebrate sensory neurons, interneurons, and motorneurons may derive from a common cell type that combined sensory, information processing and motor output functions. Second, that environmental light may modulate information transmission and processing in a distinct set of vertebrate interneurons and motorneurons.
