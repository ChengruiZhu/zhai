This study was designed to evaluate the use of computer-assisted navigation with computed tomography (CT) images for bone reconstruction after resection in malignant bone tumor treatment. Forty-five patients with malignant bone tumors were recruited for this study. CT scan images in a computer-assisted navigation system were used to assist during the osteotomy, the pairing with allografts, and the monitoring of the allograft and joint lines to perform joint reconstruction. Our results show that osteotomy and allograft pairing were successful in all patients. The average duration of the osteotomy procedures was 46.8±12.3 min; and the average pairing time was 32.5±9.8 min. The anatomical registration points and the three-dimensional virtual CT images were successfully matched. The average error of registration was 0.36±0.09 mm. Also, the range of tumor resection and allograft osteotomy were successfully paired, with an average error of 0.11±0.03 mm. No complications such as unequal limbs length or joint deformities occurred after reconstruction. The average follow-up time was 11.6±3.9 months. The tumor recurrence rate was 11.1% (5/45) and the survival rate 95.6% (43/45). The average healing time for the allograft and host bone was 5.5±1.2 months and no unexpected internal fixations, fractures or joint collapses occurred. The average knee joint functionality MSTS score was 25.5±6.6 points. No significant differences were found in the length of tumor resection, rate of negative incision margin, duration of osteotomy or of pairing, registration error or allogeneic bone and defect matching error averages between those patients with tumor recurrence and those without it (p>0.05). Based on our results, the computer-assisted navigation system for bone reconstruction after malignant tumor resection allows for high precision during osteotomy, delivers a high success rate of pairing, results in great limb function and low complication rates, and is thus a highly successful and safe approach benefiting bone cancer patients.
