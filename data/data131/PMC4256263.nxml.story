Fungi are important primary decomposers of organic material as well as amazing chemical engineers, synthesizing a wide variety of natural products, some with potent toxic activities, including antibiotics and mycotoxins. In fungal genomes, the genes involved in these metabolic pathways can be physically linked on chromosomes, forming gene clusters. This extraordinary metabolic diversity is integral to the variety of ecological strategies that fungi employ, but we still know little about the evolutionary processes involved in its generation. To address this question, we analyzed 247,202 enzyme-encoding genes participating in hundreds of metabolic reactions from 208 diverse fungal genomes to examine how two major sources of gene innovation, namely gene duplication and horizontal gene transfer, have contributed to the evolution of clustered and non-clustered metabolic pathways. We discovered that gene duplication is the dominant and consistent driver of metabolic innovation across fungal lineages and metabolic categories; in contrast, horizontal gene transfer appears highly variable both across organisms and functions. The effects of both gene duplication and horizontal gene transfer were more pronounced in clustered genes than in their non-clustered counterparts suggesting that metabolic gene clusters are hotspots for the generation of fungal metabolic diversity.
