Pemphigus vegetans (PVeg) is a rare variant of pemphigus vulgaris characterized by pustules and/or papillomatous vegetations, preferentially affecting intertriginous and periorificial areas. Exceptional manifestations may be misdiagnosed resulting in delayed diagnosis and treatment. Diagnosis is confirmed by immunofluorescence and detection of anti-desmoglein (Dsg) 3 and/or anti-Dsg1 antibodies. We herein report an unusual manifestation of PVeg. At the time of first presentation, lesions were restricted to the right ring finger's tip. Although mucous membranes were initially not affected, high levels of anti-Dsg3 antibodies were detected while anti-Dsg1 and anti-desmocollin (Dsc) 1, 2, and 3 antibodies were absent. To compare our immunological findings with previous reports, all accessible Anglophone literature published since December 1988 was evaluated. We identified 52 patients suffering from PVeg, 7 of these showed anti-Dsg3 antibodies without any mucous membrane involvement. Notably, the detection of anti-Dsg1 and anti-Dsg3 antibodies does not necessarily correlate with the involvement of skin and/or mucous membranes. This might be due to more specific and complex antibody constellations in nonclassical or atypical pemphigus.
