Protein aggregation is a process by which identical proteins self-associate into imperfectly ordered macroscopic entities. Such aggregates are associated with several pathological conditions in humans, including Alzheimer disease, Parkinson disease, and diabetes type II. Furthermore, protein aggregation is a major concern in the biotechnological production of recombinant proteins and the storage of proteins, and is a central mechanism of protein folding. In general, two classes of protein aggregates are classified: first, highly ordered aggregates can be composed of native globular molecules, such as the hemoglobin molecules in sickle-cell fibrils, or reorganized into β-sheet–rich aggregates, termed amyloid-like fibrils; and second, amorphous aggregates that lack any long-range order. Here, we demonstrate that bacterial inclusion bodies, which have been believed to be made up of amorphous aggregates, are in fact amyloid-like, comprising cross-β structure that is dependent on amino-acid sequence. These findings suggest that inclusion bodies are structured, that amyloid formation is a process present in both eukaryotes and prokaryotes, that amino acid sequences can evolve to avoid the amyloid conformation, and that there might be no amorphous state of a protein aggregate.
