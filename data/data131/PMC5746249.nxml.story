Fine-tuning of many cellular processes relies on weak, transient protein-protein interactions. Such interactions often involve compact functional modules, called short linear motifs (SLiMs) that can bind to specific globular domains. SLiM-mediated interactions can carry out diverse molecular functions by targeting proteins to specific cellular locations, regulating the activity and binding preferences of proteins, or aiding the assembly of macromolecular complexes. The key to the function of SLiMs is their small size and highly flexible nature. At the same time, these properties make their experimental identification challenging. Consequently, only a small portion of SLiM-mediated interactions is currently known. This underlies the importance of novel computational methods that can reliably identify candidate sites involved in binding to linear motif binding domains. Here we present a novel bioinformatic approach that efficiently predicts new binding partners for SLiM-binding domains. We applied this method to the dynein light chain LC8, a protein that was already known to bind many partners in a wide range of organisms. With this method, we not only significantly expanded the interaction network of LC8, but also identified a novel function of LC8 in a highly important pathway controlling organ size in animals.
