The CD4+ T cell population within HIV-infected individuals declines slowly as disease progresses. When CD4+ cells drop to below 200 cells/ul, the infection is usually considered to enter the late stage, i.e., acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS). CD4+ T cell depletion can take many years but the biological events underlying such slow decline are not well understood. Some studies showed that the majority of infected T cells in lymph nodes die by pyroptosis, a form of programmed cell death, which can release inflammatory signals attracting more CD4+ T cells to be infected. We developed mathematical models to describe this process and explored whether they can generate the long-term CD4+ T cell decline. We showed that pyroptosis induced cell movement can explain the slow time scale of CD4+ T cell depletion and that pyroptosis may also contribute to the persistence of latently infected cells, which represent a major obstacle to HIV eradication. The modeling prediction agrees with patient data in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. These results suggest that a combination of current treatment regimens and caspase-1 inhibitor that can inhibit pyroptosis might provide a new way to maintain the CD4+ T cell population and eradicate the HIV latent reservoir.
