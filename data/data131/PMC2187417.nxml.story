We have previously shown that increased nonenzymatic glycosylation occurs in peripheral nervous tissue of diabetic humans and animals, primarily on the PO-protein of peripheral nerve myelin. The pathophysiologic mechanism by which this biochemical alteration leads to myelin breakdown and removal is not as yet understood. In the present study we show that advanced glycosylation end-product (AGE) adducts that form during long-term exposure of peripheral nerve myelin proteins to glucose in vitro and in vivo markedly alter the way in which myelin interacts with elicited macrophages. In this interaction, macrophages appear to specifically recognize AGEs on myelin, since AGE- BSA competes nearly as effectively as AGE-myelin, while neither unmodified BSA nor unmodified myelin compete. The failure of yeast mannan to interfere with macrophage recognition of AGE-myelin suggests that the mannose/fucose receptor does not mediate this process. Recognition of AGE-protein by macrophages is associated with endocytosis, as demonstrated by resistance of cell-associated radioactivity to removal by trypsin action, and by low temperature inhibition of ligand accumulation in the cellular fraction. 125I- labeled myelin that had been incubated in vitro with 50 mM glucose for 8 wk reached a steady state accumulation within thioglycolate-elicited macrophages that was five times greater than that of myelin incubated without glucose. Similarly, myelin isolated from rats having diabetes for 1.5-2.0 years duration had a steady state level that was 9 times greater than that of myelin from young rats, and 3.5 times greater than that of myelin from age-matched controls. In contrast, myelin isolated from rats having diabetes for 4-5 wk had the same degree of accumulation observed with myelin of age-matched normal rats. These data suggest that the amount of increased nonenzymatic glycosylation observed in the myelin of short-term diabetic rats had not yet resulted in the significant accumulation of AGE-myelin present both in vitro and in the long-term diabetic rats. The disappearance of acid-insoluble radioactivity from within the cells and the appearance of acid-soluble radioactivity released into the medium were very similar for the two groups, suggesting that the striking difference in accumulation seen between normal myelin and AGE-myelin is due primarily to increased uptake. Formation of irreversible AGE-adducts on myelin appears to promote the recognition and uptake of the modified myelin by macrophages. This interaction between AGE-myelin and macrophages may initiate or contribute to the segmental demyelination associated with diabetes and the normal aging of peripheral nerve.
