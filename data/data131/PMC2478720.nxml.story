Little is known about the functional evolution of new hominoid genes. In this study, we utilized a combination of evolutionary analyses and cell biology experiments to unveil a novel mode by which the human- and ape-specific glutamate dehydrogenase enzyme (GLUD2) functionally adapted. We find that whereas the GLUD1 parental protein (present in all mammals) localizes to mitochondria and also to the cytoplasm, GLUD2 is specifically targeted to mitochondria. Using resurrected ancestral proteins and site-directed mutagenesis, we show that the optimized mitochondrial targeting capacity of GLUD2 is due to a single positively selected amino acid substitution in its N-terminal targeting sequence, which occurred soon after the duplication event in the ape ancestor 18â€“25 million years ago. The specialization in mitochondrial localization is probably linked to the function of GLUD2 in the glutamate metabolism of the brain (recycling of glutamate in astrocytes), but is likely also of functional relevance in other tissues in which GLUD2 is expressed. We suggest that in addition to the traditionally considered modes of functional adaptation (changes in gene expression and/or the biochemical function of the protein), rapid and selectively driven subcellular adaptation to specific ancestral compartments may represent a common yet previously little-considered mechanism for the origin of new gene functions.
