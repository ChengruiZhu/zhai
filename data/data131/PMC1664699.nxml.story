Stem cells are able to develop into many specialized cell types and thus have the potential to be used to repair or replace damaged cells. One of the challenges that scientists face is learning how to multiply these cells in vitro without loss of their stem cell properties. The development of more rapid assays for stem cells in cultured populations would significantly aid the optimization of culture conditions for stem cells. The authors propose an assay for mouse embryonic stem cells based on the expression change of seven marker genes and show that it can detect both increases and decreases in the frequency of stem cells. The assay was developed by analyzing three independent microarray datasets that ask similar biological questions but use different experimental designs. Gene expression profiles were identified within each dataset that exhibited patterns consistent with loss of stem cell properties, and, using a novel statistical measure, these profiles were compared between datasets in an unbiased fashion. A similar experimental design could be used to develop other stem cell population assays, and the analytical methods are adaptable to unrelated biological questions where analysis of a diverse set of microarray experiments is useful.
