The different molecular subtypes of breast cancer are associated with distinct outcomes. We assessed the efficacy of breast conservation therapy (BCT) followed by radiotherapy for patients with different breast cancer subtypes. We searched the MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Cochrane Library databases to identify studies published prior to April 30, 2016 that assessed the efficacy of BCT followed by radiotherapy in breast cancer patients with different molecular subtypes. A meta-analysis of seven studies that included 3,798 luminal A, 770 luminal B, 344 human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (Her-2), and 767 triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) patients was performed. The pooled odds ratio [OR] for local relapse-free survival in luminal A compared to Her-2 patients was 0.1960 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.0440–0.8728, p = 0.0325) at 5 years and 0.2592 (95% CI: 0.1301–0.5167, p = 0.0001) at 10 years. The pooled OR for local-regional relapse-free survival in luminal A compared to TNBC patients was 0.1381 (95% CI: 0.0565–0.3374, p = 0.0000) at 5 years and 0.1221 (95% CI: 0.0182–0.8192, p = 0.0304) at 10 years. Thus, the rate of local-regional control is higher in luminal A patients than in Her-2 or TNBC patients.
