 on days 1, 8 and 15 every 3 weeks for up to 6 21‐day cycles. Dose escalation followed a 3 + 3 design to determine dose‐limiting toxicities, maximum tolerated dose and the recommended phase 2 dose. Nine patients (median age 62 [range 27–72] years) received a median of 5 (range 3–6) cycles of treatment (3 at 100 mg, 6 at 150 mg). There were no dose‐limiting toxicities. The most common adverse events of any grade were neutropenia (100%), alopecia (89%), peripheral sensory neuropathy (78%), and anemia, nausea and malaise (67% each). Grade 3 or 4 adverse events were associated with myelosuppression. Pharmacokinetics of carboplatin/paclitaxel were similar at both veliparib doses. Response, assessed in five patients, was partial in four and complete in one (objective response rate 100%). The response could not be assessed in four patients who had no measurable disease at baseline. The recommended phase 2 dose of veliparib, when combined with carboplatin/paclitaxel, is 150 mg b.i.d. Findings from this phase 1 trial demonstrate the tolerability and safety of veliparib with carboplatin/paclitaxel, a regimen with potential clinical benefit in Japanese women with ovarian cancer.
