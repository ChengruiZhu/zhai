 were measured in the medium. Receptor activator of nuclear factor-kappaB ligand (RANKL), osteoprotegerin (OPG), interleukin-6 (IL-6), cyclooxygenase-2 (COX2), matrix-extracellular phosphoglycoprotein (MEPE), cysteine-rich protein 61 (CYR61), and SOST gene expression was quantified by qPCR. Osteoclast precursors were cultured with PFF-conditioned medium (PFF-CM) or static-conditioned medium (stat-CM), and osteoclast formation was assessed. RA serum alone did not affect IL-6, CYR61, COX2, MEPE, or SOST gene expression in osteocytes. However, RA serum enhanced the RANKL/OPG expression ratio by 3.4-fold, while PFF nullified this effect. PFF enhanced NO production to the same extent in control serum (2.6–3.5-fold) and RA serum-pretreated (2.7–3.6-fold) osteocytes. Stat-CM from RA serum-pretreated osteocytes enhanced osteoclastogenesis compared with stat-CM from control serum-pretreated osteocytes, while PFF nullified this effect. In conclusion, RA serum, containing inflammatory factors, did not alter the intrinsic capacity of osteocytes to sense mechanical stimuli, but upregulated osteocyte-to-osteoclast communication. Mechanical loading nullified this upregulation, suggesting that mechanical stimuli could contribute to the prevention of osteoporosis in inflammatory disease.
