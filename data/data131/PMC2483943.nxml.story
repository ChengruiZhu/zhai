Regulation of phosphate homeostasis is a tightly controlled hormonal process involving the intestine, kidneys, and bone, and imbalance of this homeostasis may influence overall mineralization. Fibroblast growth factor-23 (FGF-23) is a circulating hormone produced in the bone that mainly targets the kidneys to control the activity of the sodium/phosphate co-transporters NaPi2a and NaPi2c. These transporters are responsible for actively reabsorbing phosphate ions into the body to maintain physiological serum phosphate levels. Changes in FGF-23 activity lead to human disorders associated with either phosphate wasting or retention. Genetically altered mice in which Fgf-23 activity is lost exhibit severe hyperphosphatemia accompanied by increased NaPi2a activity, and they develop abnormal bone mineralization. Here we describe a new mouse model in which we eliminated NaPi2a from Fgf-23 null mice and show reversal of hyperphosphatemia to hypophosphatemia, suggesting that NaPi2a is the major regulator of phosphate homeostasis. However, the skeletal mineralization defect observed in mice lacking Fgf-23 function remained unchanged in the absence of NaPi2a in these mice. Thus our data indicate that Fgf-23 has a role in controlling bone mineralization independent of systemic phosphate levels.
