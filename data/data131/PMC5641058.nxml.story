Although aggressive invasion and distant metastases are an important cause of morbidity and mortality in patients with endometrial cancer (EC), the requisite events determining this propensity are currently unknown. Using organotypic three-dimensional culture of endometrial cancer cell lines, we demonstrated anti-correlated TGF-β signalling gene expression patterns that arise among extracellular matrix (ECM)-attached cells. TGF-β pathway seemed to be active in EC cells forming non-glandular colonies in 3D-matrix but weaker in glandular colonies. Functionally we found that out of several ECM proteins, fibronectin relatively promotes Smad phosphorylation suggesting a potential role in regulating TGF-β signalling in non-glandular colonies. Importantly, alteration of TGF-β pathway induced EMT and MET in both type of colonies through slug protein. The results exemplify a crucial role of TGF-β pathway during EC metastasis in human patients and inhibition of the pathway in a murine model impaired tumour cell invasion and metastasis depicting an attractive target for therapeutic intervention of malignant tumour progression. These findings provide key insights into the role of ECM-derived TGF-β signalling to promote endometrial cancer metastasis and offer an avenue for therapeutic targeting of microenvironment derived signals along with tumour cells.
