The specificity of transplantation immunity and T cell cytotoxicity against leukemias induced by RadLV was examined. Subcutaneous inoculation of two RadLV leukemias induced in BALB/c mice, BALBRVB and BALBRVD, resulted in initial tumor growth in CB6F1 mice, followed by complete tumor regression. Mice that had rejected leukemias BALBRVB or BALBRVD were subsequently challenged with various tumors of BALB/c origin. The growth of all five RadLV leukemias tested, and of one radiation-induced leukemia, was significantly inhibited. Another radiation-induced leukemia, a methylcholanthrene-induced sarcoma, and a leukemia induced by the Moloney leukemia virus, were not inhibited. The results indicate that RadLV leukemias share cell surface antigens that induce transplantation immunity in vivo. Cytotoxic lymphocytes were generated by coculturing spleen cells from mice that had rejected leukemia BALBRVB or BALBRVD with the corresponding leukemia cells. Direct tests and inhibition tests showed that such cytotoxic cells recognized individually specific antigens on leukemias BALBRVB and BALBRVD, distinct from the shared antigens detected in transplantation experiments. The effector cells in cytotoxicity assays were Thy-1+, Lyt- 1+,-, Lyt-2+, and Lyt-3+ T cells.
