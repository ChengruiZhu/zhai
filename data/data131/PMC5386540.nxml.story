Recombinant human arginase (rhArg), an enzyme capable of depleting arginine, has been shown to be an effective therapeutic approach for various cancers. Non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC), a histological subtype of pulmonary carcinoma, has a high rate of morbidity and mortality in the world. Thus, the need for novel and more effective treatment is urgent. In this study, it is the first time to report that rhArg could induce significant cytotoxicity and caspase-dependent apoptosis in NSCLC cells. Subsequently, our research revealed that rhArg dramatically stimulated autophagic response in NSCLC cells, which was proved by the formation and accumulation of autophagosomes and the conversion of microtubule-associated protein light chain 3 (LC3) from LC3-I to LC3-II. Furthermore, blocking autophagy by chloroquine or LY294002 remarkably enhanced rhArg-induced cytotoxicity and caspase-dependent apoptosis, suggesting that autophagy acted a cytoprotective role in rhArg-treated NSCLC cells. Further experiments showed that two signaling pathways including the Akt/mTOR and extracellular signal-regulated kinase pathway, and mitochondrial-derived reactive oxygen species (ROS) production were involved in rhArg-induced autophagy and apoptosis. Meanwhile, N-acetyl-
