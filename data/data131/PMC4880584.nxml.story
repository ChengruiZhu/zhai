Vilazodone is a novel antidepressant having a selective serotonin (5-HT) reuptake inhibitor and 5-HT1A receptor partial agonist profile, so it has been regarded as a serotonin partial agonist-reuptake inhibitor (SPARI). We aimed to provide Vilazodone's clinical implications mainly by reviewing published clinical trials. Vilazodone has been speculated to have three potential benefits including faster onset of action, greater efficacy, and better tolerability owning to its SPARI properties. However, no studies conducted so far have directly proven the above speculations. Five initial phase II trials failed to distinguish vilazodone from placebo in the treatment of MDD, but 4 randomized clinical trials (RCT), 3 post-hoc or pooled analysis, 1 long-term open label study, and a meta-analysis showed vilazodone's superior efficacy over placebo. The studies also showed vilazodone is generally safe and tolerable. However, diarrhea, nausea, headache, dizziness, dry mouth, and insomnia warrant close attention in clinical practice because they have been constantly noted throughout the clinical studies. 2 RCTs recently documented the efficacy and safety of vilazodone in patients with generalized anxiety disorder, which could be a start of broadening vilazodone's usage or FDA approval in diverse anxiety disorders.
