. In the present study we show the same inhibitory effect of both lectins on the cerulein pancreatitis of rats. This acute pancreatitis was induced by supramaximal injections (5 µg/kg/h iv or 10 µg/kg/h ip) of the CCK analogue cerulein in rats every hour. To monitor the degree of pancreatitis, we measured the number and diameter of injury vacuoles in the pancreatic acinar cells as one of the most important signs of this type of pancreatitis by light microscopic morphometry with two different systems on paraffin sections. Furthermore, the serum α-amylase activity was measured biochemically. We found a correlation between the diameter of vacuoles inside the acinar cells and the serum enzyme activity up to 24 h. The simultaneous ip administration of cerulein and WGA or UEA in a dosage of 125 µg/kg/h for 8 h led to a reduction of vacuolar diameter from 13.1 ± 2.0 µm (cerulein) to 7.5 ± 1.1 µm (cerulein + WGA) or 7.2 ± 1.3 µm (cerulein + UEA). The serum amylase activity was reduced from 63.7 ± 15.8 mmol/l \times min (cerulein) to 37.7 ± 11.8 (cerulein + WGA) or 39.4; +52.9; -31.1 (cerulein + UEA-I). Both parameters allow the grading this special type of pancreatitis to demonstrate the protective effect of the lectins.
