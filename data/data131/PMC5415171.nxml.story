Corneal abrasions are one of the most common ocular injuries seen in the emergency department. While most patients with corneal abrasions complain of excruciating pain, permanent sequelae may develop if not managed properly. The use of topical antibiotics and other standards of treatment have greatly reduced the incidence of complications. However, there is still a lack of consensus regarding the proper management of pain in corneal abrasions. Proposed analgesics for the control of corneal abrasion pain include topical nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), topical anesthetics, and topical cycloplegics. For this review, ten published randomized controlled trials were identified, focusing on the efficacy and safety of different topical analgesics used in treating corneal abrasions.  Six of the trials focused on topical NSAIDs, three on topical anesthetics, and one on topical cycloplegics. There were mixed results regarding the efficacy of topical analgesics in reducing pain in patients with corneal abrasions. This review of the literature revealed that topical NSAIDs produced reductions in pain symptoms, whereas topical anesthetics and cycloplegics did not demonstrate significant improvements in either healing rates or pain control. Thus, this evidence supports the use of topical NSAIDs in the standard management of corneal abrasions. Unfortunately, the power of these studies is largely limited by small sample sizes. Larger studies must be conducted before topical analgesics can be recommended or discouraged for pain management in corneal abrasions. However, based on this review of the literature, the use of topical NSAIDs does not appear to complicate wound healing, and thus remains a safe option in patients desiring medical treatment.
