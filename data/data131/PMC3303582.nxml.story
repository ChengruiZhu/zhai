The dioxins and dioxin-like compounds in cigarette smoke and environmental pollutants modulate immunological responses. These environmental toxicants are known to cause lung cancer but have also recently been implicated in allergic and inflammatory diseases such as bronchitis, asthma, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). In a novel pathway of this response, the activation of a nuclear receptor, arylhydrocarbon receptor (AhR), mediates the effects of these toxins through the arachidonic acid cascade, cell differentiation, cell-cell adhesion interactions, cytokine expression, and mucin production that are implicated in the pathogenesis and exacerbation of asthma/COPD. We have previously reported that human bronchial epithelial cells express AhR, and AhR activation induces mucin production through reactive oxygen species. This review discusses the role of AhR in asthma and COPD, focusing in particular on inflammatory and resident cells in the lung. We describe the important impact that AhR activation may have on the inflammation phase in the pathology of asthma and COPD. In addition, crosstalk of AhR signaling with other ligand-activated transcription factors such as peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs) has been well documented.
