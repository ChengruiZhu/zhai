Networks of sexual contacts and of spatial proximity are of interest for the understanding of epidemics because they define potential pathways by which sexual and airborne infections spread. These networks are not static but vary, with both vertices and links appearing and disappearing at different times. One of the temporal properties observed across systems is that the time lapse between two contacts is irregular, which means that high activity is followed by long intervals of idleness. In this article, by using a theoretical model of a dynamic network co-evolving with a simulated infection, we show that such heterogeneity leads to earlier epidemic outbreaks and increased prevalence of infections for a range of parameters, in comparison to scenarios of regular activity, which is the current modeling paradigm in mathematical epidemiology. We also include a turnover rate to model individuals entering and leaving the system, and we show that if turnover is high, the relative difference in the prevalence of heterogeneous and homogeneous contact patterns increases due to the continuous influx of susceptible individuals. These heterogeneities also increase the expected number of secondary infections produced by a single infected vertex in a completely susceptible population.
