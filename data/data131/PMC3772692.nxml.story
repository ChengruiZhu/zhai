The subject is a 34-year-old, half-Chinese male; NF-1 was suspected at age 15 years for the first time. His medical history included preterm birth, mild facial dysmorphism, “café au lait” spots, subcutaneous and paravertebral fibromas, multifocal tachycardia, atrial fibrillation, and heart failure in early infancy. Noncalcified bone fibromas in the femur and tibia were detected at age 8 years. Surgical right leg lengthening was carried out at age 11 years. Bilateral renal artery stenosis, stenosis and aneurysm of the superior mesenteric artery, and an infrarenal aortic stenosis were detected at age 15 years. Leg edema and ectasia of the basilar artery were diagnosed at age 18 years. After an episode with an erysipela at age 34 years, he developed pericardial and pleural effusion during a 4-month period. Stenosis of the left subclavian vein at the level of thoracic duct insertion was detected. After repeated pleural punctures, pleural effusion was interpreted as chylothorax. Reduction of lymph fluid production by diet and injection of talcum into the pleural cavity had a long-term beneficial effect on the chylothorax. Leg edema and chylothorax were attributed to affliction of the lymph vessels by the NF-1.
