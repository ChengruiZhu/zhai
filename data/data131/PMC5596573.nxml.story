-H2AX, a marker for the DNA double-strand breaks (DSB). Sunitinib, a multi-targeted receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor, was found to enhance the autophagic flux concurring with increase in the frequency of micronuclei accrued upon inhibition of autophagy, and similar results were also obtained in the rasfonin-treated cells. Moreover, the punctate LC3 staining colocalized with micronuclei. Unexpectedly, deprivation of SQSTM1/p62 alone accumulated micronuclei, which was not further increased upon challenge with ST. Rad51 is a protein central to repairing DSB by homologous recombination and treatment with ST or rasfonin decreased its expression. In several cell lines, p62 appeared in the immunoprecipites of Rad51, whereas LC3, Ulk1 and p62 interacted with PARP-1, another protein involved in DNA repair and genomic stability. In addition, knockdown of either Rad51 or PARP-1 completely inhibited the ST-induced autophagic flux. Taken together, the data presented here demonstrated that both LC3-II and the phosphorylated Ulk1 localized in nuclei and interacted with the proteins essential for nuclear stability, thereby revealing a more intimate relationship between autophagy and genomic stability.
