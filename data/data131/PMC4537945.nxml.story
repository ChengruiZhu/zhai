The extent of infarct injury is a key determinant of structural and functional remodeling following myocardial infarction (MI). Infarct volume in experimental models of MI can be determined accurately by in vivo magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), but this is costly and not widely available. Experimental studies therefore commonly assess injury by histological analysis of sections sampled from the infarcted heart, an approach that is labor intensive, can be subjective, and does not fully assess the extent of injury. The present study aimed to assess the suitability of optical projection tomography (OPT) for identification of injured myocardium and for accurate and efficient assessment of infarct volume. Intact, perfusion-fixed, optically cleared hearts, collected from mice 7 days after induction of MI by coronary artery occlusion, were scanned by a tomograph for autofluorescence emission after UV excitation, generating >400 transaxial sections for reconstruction. Differential autofluorescence permitted discrimination between viable and injured myocardium and highlighted the heterogeneity within the infarct zone. Two-dimensional infarct areas derived from OPT imaging and Masson's trichrome staining of slices from the same heart were highly correlated (r
