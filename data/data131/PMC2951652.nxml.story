In the remitted phase of bipolar I disorder, sexual dysfunction is commonly due to drugs used in the treatment rather than the disease itself. There are very few studies, especially in the Indian population, addressing the frequency of sexual dysfunction due to antipsychotics in bipolar I disorder. Hence this study was done to determine the sexual dysfunction due to antipsychotics and to compare the same among typical and atypical antipsychotics. A cross sectional study with 108 male patients of remitted bipolar I disorder (DSM-IV), chosen by purposive sampling technique was done. Psychopathology was assessed using the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale, Structured Interview Guide for the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale and Young Mania Rating Scale. Sexual side effects due to antipsychotics were assessed using the Udvalg for Kliniske ndersogelser (UKU) side effect rating scale. The total sample size was divided into two groups of those on typical antipsychotics (n = 53) and atypical antipsychotics (n = 55). The two groups were compared for sexual dysfunction using Chi-square test. Results showed dysfunction in at least one phase of the sexual response cycle, comprising of desire, arousal and orgasm, was present in 66% of the sample population. Erectile dysfunction was present in 42% of the sample population and it was the most common type of sexual dysfunction reported. It was also significantly different across the two groups (p = 0.025). There was no significant difference in other aspects of sexual dysfunction across the two groups. In conclusion patients of Bipolar I disorder experience sexual side effects of antipsychotics frequently. Erectile dysfunction is the most common sexual dysfunction among men and this is significantly higher with typical than atypical antipsychotics.
