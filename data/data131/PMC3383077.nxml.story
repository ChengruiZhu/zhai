A pectoralis major myofascial flap (PMMF) is a simple variant of the pectoralis major myocutaneous flap (PMMC), and allows avoiding some of the disadvantages of Ariyan's technique while reducing well-known, overall complications. This is a retrospective analysis of 45 hypopharyngeal reconstructions (40 immediate reconstructions after subtotal pharyngolaryngectomy and 5 performed during revision surgery) using PMMF flap, performed from February 1995 to February 2008 in the Department of Otolaryngology at the "San Camillo- Forlanini" Hospitals in Rome, in collaboration with the Department of Plastic Surgery. In our series, we observed postoperative flap-related complications in 6.7% of cases. The incidence of major flap complications requiring surgical revision was 2.2%. Two minor complications were seen: hypopharyngeal stenosis and a salivary fistula, both of which were managed without surgery. Total or partial necrosis did not occur in any case. There were four postoperative deaths, but which were not related to flap complications in any case. In the remaining cases, oesophageal X-ray imaging showed the absence of fistulas and adequate calibre of the reconstructed tract; oral intake started within postoperative day 10-12, without swallowing problems of liquid or solid food. Postoperative radiotherapy performed in 30 patients was well tolerated. The PMMF flap is safe one-step procedure with low morbidity that is particularly useful for partial hypopharyngeal reconstructions, overcoming the disadvantages of the PMMC flap and offering comparable results to fasciocutaneous free flaps.
