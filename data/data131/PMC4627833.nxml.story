Developmental venous anomalies (DVA) are among the most common congenital malformations of the cerebral angioarchitecture. Spontaneous thrombosis of this entity is rare, and our review of the literature found only 31 reported cases of symptomatic spontaneous thrombosis of developmental venous anomalies. Here, we report a unique case describing the spontaneous thrombosis of a DVA leading to venous infarction and subsequent recanalization. The patient was a previously healthy 21-year-old male who presented with an acute onset of partial seizures. Following negative hypercoagulability studies and along with CT (computed tomography) and MR (magnetic resonance) imaging, the patient was treated with anticoagulant therapy and demonstrated complete functional recovery. Knowledge from our literature review of similar cases combined with the experience gained from this patient’s treatment leads us to suggest that spontaneous DVA thrombosis and venous infarction generally has a good outcome despite initially devastating neurologic deficits. Additionally, the rarity of spontaneous DVA thromboses lends itself to the need to identify possible predisposing risk factors, chief amongst these being hypercoagulopathies.
