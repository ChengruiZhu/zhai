 contain 9-membered centrioles, germ line tissues develop giant centrioles with 60–90 singlet tubules disposed in an oval array. Some 9-membered centrioles still may be seen in second instar spermatogonia. Each of these centrioles is associated with a larger "daughter" or secondary centriole at right angles to it. Most centrioles of second instar spermatogonia consist of 20–50 singlet tubules arranged in an oval, sometimes associated with an even larger secondary centriole. The more recently formed centriole of a pair is distinguishable from its partner by a concentric band of electron-opaque material inside its tubules. If a pair of centrioles at right angles to each other is pictured as a "T" formed by two cylinders, the secondary centriole is always the stem of the T; the primary centriole is the top. The two centrioles are oriented at the pole of the mitotic spindle so that the tubules of the primary centriole are parallel to the spindle axis. Each daughter cell receives a pair of centrioles and, during interphase, each of these centrioles gives rise to a new daughter centriole. A Golgi area of characteristic morphology is found in association with centrioles shortly after two new ones have formed. We conclude that in
