Succinylacetone (SA) (4,6-dioxoheptanoic acid) is an abnormal metabolite produced in patients with hereditary tyrosinemia as a consequence of an inherited deficiency of fumaryl acetoacetate hydrolase activity. Patients with this disease are associated with a number of abnormalities, including aminoaciduria, proteinuria, liver failure, commonly hepatoma, and decreased GSH concentration in the liver. In the course of our studies of tyrosinemia, we found that the urine of patients with this disorder contains material(s) that absorbs light at 315 nm. We investigated the nature of the 315 nm material in detail. SA was found to react with amino acids and protein nonenzymatically, to form stable adducts at physiological temperature and pH. All SA adducts with amino acids and/or proteins exhibited an absorption peak at 315 nm. Although all amino acids reacted with SA, the most reactive amino acid was lysine (Lys), followed, in order, by glycine, methionine, phenylalanine, serine, alanine, and glutamine. SA- adducts were unstable at pH below 6, while they were made considerably more stable after reduction with NaBH4, suggesting that SA forms an adduct via Schiff base formation. High-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) analysis of urines from patients with tyrosinemia revealed the existence of SA-glycine, SA-methionine, SA-tyrosine, and SA-phenylalanine. After digestion of urines with proteinase K, three more HPLC peaks appeared, which all corresponded to SA-Lys adducts. TLC analysis of SA-Lys showed that SA-Lys could form as many as seven different adducts. No SA-adduct peaks were observed in HPLC in urines from normal subjects, patients with other forms of aminoaciduria, or patients with the nephrotic syndrome. In addition to amino acids and proteins, SA reacted with reduced glutathione (GSH) and formed a stable adduct. These findings suggest that SA adduct formation with amino acids, GSH, and proteins is a significant process occurring in tyrosinemia, and may account for certain of the pathologic findings in this hereditary disorder.
