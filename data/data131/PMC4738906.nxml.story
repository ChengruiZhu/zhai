The Friel Anaerobic Threshold Test (FATT) has been used to determine anaerobic threshold (AT). The FATT suggests AT occurs near the heart rate deflection point (HRDP) at a rating of perceived exertion (RPE) of 17. Purpose: The primary purpose of this study was to determine 1) whether the HRDP could be determined using the FATT, 2) examine differences between HRVT and HR that coincided Borg’s rating of perceived exertion (RPE) of 17, and 3) if riding position (hoods or aero) would influence performance. Methods: Fourteen male cyclists (30.4 ± 7.41years of age; 151.8 ± 60.4 cycled miles/week) participated in the study. Each subject performed the FATT on two occasions within one week. Results: The findings of this study suggest that the FATT can determine HRDP in trained cyclists while riding in the hoods position but not the aero position. No significant difference was found between the hoods and aero position for HRVT as measured by the metabolic cart. Our data suggest that HR at an RPE of 15 more accurately reflects the HRVT than the RPE of 17. A low, non-significant correlation was found for both the hoods and aero (0.41 and 0.44, respectively; p > 0.20) for the HR at RPE of 17. Conclusion: The findings of this study suggest that the FATT can determine HRDP in trained cyclists. However, HRDP was identified in the cyclists preferred riding position. When performing the FATT, HRVT at an RPE of 15 should be used to estimate VT over the suggested RPE of 17.
