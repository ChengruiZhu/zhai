We studied the pretreatment of human polymorphonuclear neutrophils (PMN) with purified preparations of the anthrax toxin components-- protective antigen (PA), edema factor (EF), and lethal factor (LF)--and their effects on release of superoxide anion (O-2) after stimulation with the chemotactic peptide N-formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine (FMLP). PMN isolated in the absence of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) (less than 0.1 ng/ml) released only small amounts of O-2 after FMLP stimulation; pretreatment with anthrax toxin had little effect. The release of O-2 was increased fivefold by prior treatment with 3 ng/ml LPS for 1 h at 37 degrees C, an effect referred to as priming. PMN were primed to an equivalent extent by treatment with 100 ng/ml N-acetyl- muramyl-L-alanyl-D-isoglutamine (muramyl dipeptide [MDP]). Pretreatment of PMN with anthrax toxin components PA plus EF or PA plus LF inhibited priming by LPS or MDP, as shown by the reduction in the release of O-2 up to 90% relative to controls not treated with toxin; single toxin components were inactive. The inhibition was markedly reduced when priming with LPS or MDP was carried out before exposure to toxin. O-2 release after stimulation by phorbol myristate acetate was not increased by priming, and pretreatment with toxin did not inhibit O-2 release after this stimulus. Evidently, anthrax toxin inhibits the priming that is normally induced in PMN by bacterial products and is necessary for the full expression of antimicrobial effects.
