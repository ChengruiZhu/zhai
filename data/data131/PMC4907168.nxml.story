Studies have shown that homeobox D10 (HOXD10) is the target gene of microRNA-10b (miR-10b) and is closely associated with the inhibition of cell migration and invasion. Ras homolog family member C (RhoC) has been reported to promote tumor metastasis in various types of cancer. The effect of miR-10b on colorectal cancer (CRC) metastasis and the associated molecular mechanisms remain elusive. The present study aimed to investigate whether miR-10b could promote invasion by targeting HOXD10 in CRC by exploring the association between miR-10b and HOXD10 expression in CRC patients. The findings revealed that miR-10b levels were elevated in the CRC specimens and significantly correlated with advanced clinical stage and lymph node metastasis. In addition, HOXD10 was a direct target of miR-10b, and the increased expression of RhoC and downregulation of HOXD10 correlated with the increased expression level of miR-10b. HOXD10 protein level was also markedly attenuated in lymph node metastasis-positive tumor tissues compared with lymph node metastasis-free tumor tissues. These findings suggest that miR-10b may stimulate the upregulation of RhoC through targeting HOXD10, thus promoting the invasion and migration in CRC tumor.
