Diabetes is a disease caused by the loss or dysfunction of insulin-producing beta cells in the pancreas. Recent studies suggest that modification of the beta cells' differentiation state is among the earliest events marking the progressive failure of beta cells in diabetes. Currently, very little is known about the factors that instruct cells to adopt beta cell characteristics and maintain the differentiated state of beta cells. We have discovered that a single transcription factor can instruct precursor cells of other endocrine cell types to change their identity and differentiate into beta cells. Conversely, inactivation of the transcription factor in endocrine precursors prevents their differentiation into beta cells and results in excess production of other endocrine cell types. When the factor is specifically inactivated in beta cells, beta cells lose their identity and adopt characteristics of other endocrine cell types, similar to what is seen in animal models of diabetes. Thus, we have identified a single factor that is both sufficient to program beta cells and necessary for maintaining their differentiated state. This factor could be an important target for diabetes therapy and could help reprogram other cell types into beta cells.
