The centromere is a strange locus that derives its identity from the proteins that shape it rather than the DNA sequences it contains. It also functions in a remarkably singular way, providing a motor and command control center for the chromosome in conjunction with the kinetochore. Key to centromere identity is the chromatin that comprises it, which has a unique nucleosomal “bead on a string” including a special centromeric histone H3, called CENP-A. Found in alternating clusters of nucleosomes with “regular” histone H3, CENP-A is crucial for propagating centromere identity as well as for regulating kinetochore function. In this study, we have analysed the cell cycle dynamics of CENP-T and CENP-W, another two components of the constitutive centromere associated network. We show that, unlike CENP-A, CENP-T/W are not inherited stringently by daughter cells. Instead, these complexes - which are bound to the interstitial “regular” H3 nucleosome domains - assemble after DNA replication and are required for kinetochore formation. Thus, we propose that a stable CENP-A nucleosome population plays a role in centromere locus inheritance to daughter cells, while dynamic CENP-T/W and H3 nucleosomes provide a cycling function that triggers kinetochore assembly as cells enter mitosis in each new cell cycle.
