The database yielded an estimate of 229,362.52 extremity fractures from 2007-2012. An estimated total of 130,319.20 fractures were associated with ATVs, while 99,043.37 were associated with dirt bikes. The incidence rates of extremity fractures associated with ATV and dirt bike use were 3.87 and 6.85 per 1000 vehicle-years. Most fractures were in patients 10-19 years of age, after which the number of fractures decreased with age. The largest proportion of all fractures occurred in the shoulder (27.19%), followed by the wrist and lower leg (13.77% and 12.36%, respectively). This distribution of fractures was consistent among ATV use for all age groups except in the 0-9 year olds, where the lower arm and wrist were the most commonly fractured locations. Fracture distribution associated with dirt bike use also followed this general pattern, with the exception of 0-9 and 10-19 year olds having increased proportions of lower arm fractures. When comparing the genders, males had much larger proportions of fractures than females at all locations, except for the upper arm. When comparing the specific injury locations for different vehicle types, there were no differences in the distribution of the location of fractures among 4-wheeled or unspecified ATVs. However, 3-wheeled ATVs and dirt bikes had much larger proportion of lower leg, foot and ankle fractures compared to the other vehicle types.
