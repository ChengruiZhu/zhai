Membrane fission is a key step of fundamental intracellular processes such as endocytosis, membrane trafficking, cytokinesis and virus budding. The fission reaction requires substantial energy inputs provided by specialized proteins. Recently, the ESCRT-III proteins have been implicated in membrane budding and fission involved in multivesicular body formation, cytokinesis and virus budding. The ESCRT-III proteins self-assemble into circular filaments and flat spirals in the membrane plane and generate tubular structures with dome-like end caps. We suggest and elaborate computationally on a mechanism by which the ESCRT-III complexes can drive membrane fission. The essence of the mechanism is in generation in the course of membrane attachment to the dome-like surface of an ESCRT-III assembly of a thin membrane neck accumulating large elastic stresses. Relaxation of these stresses can drive the neck fission and formation of separate vesicles of biologically relevant sizes. Estimations of the membrane affinity to the protein surface required for the neck fission to occur and comparison of these values with the experimentally expected values justify quantitatively the proposed mechanism and demonstrate that ESCRT-III assemblies must be highly effective in promoting membrane fission.
