Suppressor of cytokine signaling 2 (SOCS2) was reported to be involved in the development of Diabetic Nephropathy (DN). However, its underlying mechanism remains undefined. Western blot was carried out to determine the expressions of SOCS2, Toll-like receptors 4 (TLR4) and nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) pathway-related proteins in DN patients, streptozotocin (STZ)-induced DN rats and high glucose (HG)-stimulated podocytes. The effects of SOCS2 overexpression on renal injury, the inflammatory cytokines production, renal pathological changes, apoptosis and the TLR4/NF-κB pathway in DN rats or HG-stimulated podocytes were investigated. TLR4 antagonist TAK-242 and NF-κB inhibitor PDTC were used to confirm the functional mechanism of SOCS2 overexpression in HG-stimulated podocytes. SOCS2 was down-regulated, while TLR4 and NF-κB were up-regulated in renal tissues of DN patients and DN rats. Ad-SOCS2 infection alleviated STZ-induced renal injury and pathological changes and inhibited STZ-induced IL-6, IL-1β and MCP-1 generation and activation of the TLR4/NF-κB pathway in DN rats. SOCS2 overexpression attenuated apoptosis, suppressed the inflammatory cytokines expression, and inactivated the TLR4/NF-κB pathway in HG-stimulated podocytes. Suppression of the TLR4/NF-κB pathway enhanced the inhibitory effect of SOCS2 overexpression on apoptosis and inflammatory cytokines expressions in HG-stimulated podocytes. SOCS2 overexpression alleviated the development of DN by inhibiting the TLR4/NF-κB pathway, contributing to developing new therapeutic strategies against DN.
