Aquaporin-4 (AQP4) is a selective water channel that is located on the plasma membrane of myofibers in skeletal muscle and is bound to α1-syntrophin. It is considered that AQP4 is involved in the modulation of homeostasis in myofibers through the regulation of water transport and osmotic pressure. However, it remains unclear whether AQP4 expression is altered by skeletal muscle hypertrophy to modulate water homeostasis in myofibers. The present study investigated the effect of muscle hypertrophy on the changes in AQP4 and α1-syntrophin expression patterns in myofibers. Novel findings indicated in the present study were as follows: 1) Expression levels of AQP4 and α1-syntrophin were stably maintained in hypertrophied muscles, and 2) AQP4 was not expressed in the myofibers containing the slow-type myosin heavy chain isoform (MHC) with or without the presence of fast-type MHC. The present study suggests that AQP4 may regulate the efficiency of water transport in hypertrophied myofibers through its interaction with α1-syntrophin. In addition, this study suggests that AQP4 expression may be inhibited by a regulatory mechanism activated under physiological conditions that induces the expression of slow-type MHC in skeletal muscles.
