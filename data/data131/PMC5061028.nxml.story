Plasmonics is a well‐established field, exploiting the interaction of light and metals at the nanoscale; with the help of surface plasmon polaritons, remote‐excitation can also be observed by using silver or gold plasmonic waveguides. Recently, plasmonic catalysis was established as a new exciting platform for heterogeneous catalytic reactions. Recent reports present remote‐excitation surface catalytic reactions as a route to enhance the rate of chemical reactions, and offer a pathway to control surface catalytic reactions. In this review, we focus on recent advanced reports on silver plasmonic waveguide for remote‐excitation surface catalytic reactions. First, the synthesis methods and characterization techniques of sivelr nanowire plasmonic waveguides are summarized, and the properties and physical mechanisms of plasmonic waveguides are presented in detail. Then, the applications of plasmonic waveguides including remote excitation fluorescence and SERS are introduced, and we focus on the field of remote‐excitation surface catalytic reactions. Finally, forecasts are made for possible future applications for the remote‐excitation surface catalysis by plasmonic waveguides in living cells.
