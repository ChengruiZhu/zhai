Oxidative damage triggers extensive repair in gametes and thereafter in the zygote but it results in clinically relevant damage when affecting the maturation of the gametes chromatin, i.e. padlocking and epigenetic marking. It associates with defective DNA methylation and/or with oxidation of the methyl marks leading to derangement of gamete epigenetics, defects of chromatin condensation and aneuploidy. A proper feed to the one carbon cycle has the potential to stimulate the endogenous antioxidant defences, i.e. gluthatione synthesis, and to activate compensative homeostatic mechanisms restoring both the oxy-redox balance and DNA methylation, which are indeed strictly cross-regulated. This has been shown to produce measurable clinical improvements of male reproductive potential in pilot studies herein summarised. However, the effects of dietary habits and of supplementations are variable according to the individual genetic substrate, as genetic variants of several of the concerned enzymes occur with high frequency. Individual risk assessments and personalised interventions are still difficult to implement, in the meantime, a very varied diet may facilitate metabolic compensation in the majority of the cases. This review aims to report on the mechanisms of damage, on the opportunities to modulate the physiologic oxy-redox homeostasis by means of a varied diet or dietary supplements and on the open issues related to the genetic variability of the population.
