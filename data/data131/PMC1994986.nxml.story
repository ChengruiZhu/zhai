Biomolecular interactions can be extraordinarily specific. In many instances, a protein can select its single correct binding partner from among a large array of closely related candidates. For polyketide synthases (PKSs), a family of bacterial enzymes, such specificity is essential. Like workers on an assembly line, PKSs function as multiprotein chains, each enzyme modifying its substrate before passing it along to the next. And like a well-designed jigsaw puzzle, the overall multiprotein chain is correctly ordered precisely because each component protein can only bind to specific nearest neighbors. A PKS multiprotein chain is held together by sticky “head” and “tail” domains found at either end of each protein, the head of one protein binding to the tail of the next. We looked for patterns in the amino-acid sequences of these domains that could explain why certain head–tail pairs bind, while others do not. We discovered that heads and tails each come in three very different varieties. Mismatched head–tail pairs do not bind at all, while the binding of a matching head–tail pair is governed by the amino acids found at a few key positions on the physical interface between these domains.
