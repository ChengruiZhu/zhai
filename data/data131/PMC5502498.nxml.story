Mucormycosis of the frontal sinus are rarely seen in day to day clinical practice. Although this fungus is commonly found in the environment, the disease is usually prevented by the immune system and is hence rare. Well-recognized risk factors for the disease include diabetes mellitus, leukemia, aplastic anemia, myelodysplastic syndrome, blood dyscrasias, and immunosuppressive therapy in organ transplantation, renal disease, sepsis, and severe burns. The disease is primarily found in those who are immunocompromised, but it may also manifest in immuno competent persons. Current therapy for the invasive disease includes early surgical debridement, antifungal therapy management of underlying predisposing factors. Early recognition of the disease and treating the underlying cause of mucormycosis, such as diabetes, are key to improving outcomes. The antifungal treatment of choice for mucormycosis is amphotericin B, although very high doses are required because of the relative resistance of the fungus to the drug. Here, we present a case of rhinocerebral mucormycosis of frontal sinus in a diabetic patient, who was managed by systemic antifungals, surgical debridement, and obliteration procedures.
