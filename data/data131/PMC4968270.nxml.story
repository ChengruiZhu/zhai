The operative limbs had significantly lower peak ground reaction forces (GRF) than both control and contralateral limbs (ACLR: 1.7 body weights (BW), Contralateral: 2.1 BW, Control: 2.1 BW; p≤0.01) along with lower average external knee flexion moments (ACLR: 0.7Nm/kg, Contralateral: 0.9Nm/kg, Control: 1.1Nm/kg; p≤0.05) and reduced power absorption at the knee (ACLR: 0.9Nm/kg, Contralateral: 1.5Nm/kg, Control: 1.2Nm/kg; p≤0.01). Operative limbs had lower peak knee flexion (ACLR: 96.8°; Contralateral: 100.7°; p=0.001) and knee flexion excursion (ACLR: 75.0°, Contralateral: 82.5°; p=0.003) than contralateral limbs, but did not differ from controls in these measures. Both operative and non-operative limbs had greater peak hip flexion (ACLR: 98.9°, Contralateral: 99.8°, Control: 83.5°; p≤0.006), hip flexion excursion (ACLR: 60.8°, Contralateral: 65.6°, Control: 49.6°; p=), and power absorption at the hip (ACLR: 1.0Nm/kg, Contralateral: 1.2Nm/kg, Control: 0.7Nm/kg; p<0.03) compared with controls. In the coronal plane, both the operative and non-operative limbs demonstrated higher peak knee valgus moments compared to controls (ACLR: 0.5Nm/kg, Contralateral: 0.4Nm/kg, Control: 0.2Nm/kg; p≤0.02) and utilized less hip ab/adduction range (ACLR: 1.7°, Contralateral: 1.9°, Control: 6.1°; p≤0.003) though there were no differences in knee valgus angles (p≥0.31) or excursion (p≥0.52).
