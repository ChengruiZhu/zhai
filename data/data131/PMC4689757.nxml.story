Follicular non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma (FL) is a nodal B lymphoid malignancy that originates from the germinal center of a lymph node. FL is the second most frequent lymphoma subtype. The course of the disease is usually characterised by a typically indolent clinical course, with a median survival rate of 8–10 years, although most patients relapse after treatment. Diagnosis should always be based on a surgical specimen like an excisional node lymph biopsy. The first-line treatment of FL will depend of extension disease, tumour burden, patient symptoms, performance status and also patient decision. The addition of rituximab to conventional chemotherapy has improved ORR, PFS and OS. As first line in patients that need treatment, a combination of chemotherapy with rituximab induction followed by 2 years of rituximab maintenance is the best option. High-dose chemotherapy with autologous stem-cell transplantation in first line has not shown improvement and is not recommended as first-line therapy. Before any treatment decision in relapsed patients, a repeat biopsy is mandatory to rule out a transformation into large cell aggressive lymphoma. Standard treatment is controversial, depends on the efficacy of prior treatment, duration of the time-to-relapse, patient’s age and histological findings at relapse.
