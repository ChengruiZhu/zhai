There is a striking trend of delayed parenthood in developed countries due to secular and socioeconomic pressures. As a result, physicians commonly consult with concerned patients inquiring about the impact of advanced age on their ability to conceive healthy offspring. The concern has more frequently surrounded the effects of advanced maternal age, but recent evidence suggests negative effects of advanced paternal age as well. Specifically, studies have demonstrated increased incidence of neuropsychiatric and other disorders in the offspring of older males. In this study we have investigated a commonly hypothesized mechanism for this effect, namely sperm DNA methylation alteration. Our data indicate that specific genomic regions of DNA methylation are commonly altered with age, suggesting that some regions of the sperm genome are more susceptible than others to age-related epigenetic changes. Importantly, a significant portion of these alterations occur at genes known to be associated with schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, both of which display increased incidence in the offspring of older fathers. These data will be important in driving future studies aimed at determining the impact that these methylation alterations may have on offspring health and will thus enable couples at advanced reproductive ages to be more informed of possible risks.
