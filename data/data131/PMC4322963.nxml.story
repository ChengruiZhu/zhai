ROS production and intracellular HSP70 levels were measured in human neutrophils for three age groups: young (20-59 years), elders (60-89 years) and nonagenarians (90 years and older). Elders showed higher levels of spontaneous intracellular ROS content compared with young and nonagenarian groups, which had similar intracellular ROS levels. Zymosan-induced (non-spontaneous) extracellular ROS levels were also similar for young and nonagenarians but were lower in elders. However, spontaneous extracellular ROS production increased continuously with age. Correlation analysis revealed positive relationships between HSP70 levels and zymosan-stimulated ROS production in the elder group. This was consistent with a promoting role for HSP70 in ROS-associated neutrophils response to pathogens. No positive correlation between ROS production and intracellular HSP70 levels was found for groups of young people and nonagenarians. In contrast, significant negative correlations of some ROS and HSP70 characteriscics were found for neutrophils from young people and nonagenarians. The observed difference in ROS and HSP70 correlations in elders and nonagenarians might be associated with an increased risk of mortality in older individuals less than 90 years old.
