 (MRSA) plates by recognition of pigmented colonies. A total of 57,690 swabs submitted for MRSA screening were enrolled in the study. Four sites enrolled specimens following their standard of care. Chromogenic agar used at these sites included MRSASelect (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Redmond, WA), chromID MRSA (bioMÃ©rieux, Marcy l'Etoile, France), and CHROMagar MRSA (BD Diagnostics, Sparks, MD). Specimens were plated and incubated using the WASPLab. The digital camera took images at 0 and 16 to 24 h and the WASPLab software determined the presence of positive colonies based on a hue, saturation, and value (HSV) score. If the HSV score fell within a defined threshold, the plate was called positive. The performance of the digital analysis was compared to manual reading. Overall, the digital software had a sensitivity of 100% and a specificity of 90.7% with the specificity ranging between 90.0 and 96.0 across all sites. The results were similar using the three different agars with a sensitivity of 100% and specificity ranging between 90.7 and 92.4%. These data demonstrate that automated digital analysis can be used to accurately sort positive from negative chromogenic agar cultures regardless of the pigmentation produced.
