The Abl kinase is a key player in many crucial cellular processes. It is also an important anti-cancer drug target, because a mutation leading to the fusion protein Bcr-Abl is the main cause for chronic myeloid leukemia (CML). Abl inhibitors are currently the only pharmaceutical treatment for CML. There are two main difficulties associated with the development of kinase inhibitors: the high similarity between active sites of different kinases, which makes selectivity a challenge, and mutations leading to resistance, which make it mandatory to search for alternative drugs. One important factor controlling Abl is the interplay between the catalytic domain and an SH2 domain. We used computer simulations to understand how the interactions between the domains modify the dynamic of the kinase and detected both local and global effects. Based on our computer model, we suggested mutations that should alter the domain-domain interplay. Consequently, we tested the mutants experimentally and found that they support our hypothesis. We propose that our findings can be of help for the development of new classes of Abl inhibitors, which would modify the domain-domain interplay instead of interfering directly with the active site.
