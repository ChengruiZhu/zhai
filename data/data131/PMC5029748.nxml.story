Advances in Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) technologies have improved the ability to detect potentially targetable mutations. However, the integration of NGS into clinical management in an individualized manner remains challenging. In this single-center observational study, we performed a dedicated NGS panel studying 41 cancer-related genes in 50 consecutive patients with metastatic non-small-cell lung cancer between May 2012 and October 2014. Molecular analysis could be performed in 48 patients with a good quality check. One hundred and thirty-three mutations, whose twenty-four unique mutations, were detected. At least one mutation was found in 46 patients. In 58% of cases, the Molecular Tumor Board (MTB) was able to recommend treatment with a targeted agent based on the evaluation of the tumor genetic profile and treatment history. Nine patients (18%) were subsequently treated with a MTB-recommended targeted therapy; four patients experienced a clinical benefit with a partial response or stabilization lasting more than 4 months. In this case series involving patients with metastatic non-small cell lung cancer, we show that including integrative clinical sequencing data into routine clinical management was feasible and could impact on patient therapeutic proposal.
