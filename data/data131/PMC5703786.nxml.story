Endothelial dysfunction is the early predictive factor for the development of atherosclerosis and future cardiovascular diseases in adulthood. The prevalence of endothelial dysfunction in children and early adolescents is increasing worldwide. Peripheral arterial tonometry is a noninvasive technique for assessing peripheral microvascular function and is used as a validated marker of endothelial function. We assessed anthropometric parameters, blood pressure, arterial stiffness, and peripheral endothelial function in 157 Japanese early adolescents (75 boys and 82 girls). We measured peripheral endothelial function by using peripheral arterial tonometry to determine the reactive hyperemia index, and assessed the association of reactive hyperemia index with parameters of anthropometry and arterial stiffness. The mean reactive hyperemia index of all subjects was 1.85 ± 0.6, and there was no difference of reactive hyperemia index according to sex. Reactive hyperemia index was significantly associated with systolic and diastolic blood pressures, and had no correlation with anthropometric parameters and arterial stiffness markers. The reactive hyperemia index values among Japanese early adolescents were similar to those reported in previous studies on children and early adolescents. This noninvasive technique may be useful for the assessment of microvascular endothelial function among children and early adolescents.
