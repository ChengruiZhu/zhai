Pleomorphic carcinoma is a rare lesion and the literature contains few reports of pleomorphic carcinoma of the gallbladder. The present study reports a rare case of primary pleomorphic carcinoma of the gallbladder for which we were able to perform curative surgery. A 77-year-old woman with dementia developed nausea and anorexia, and computed tomography demonstrated irregular thickening of the gallbladder wall. Drip infusion cholangiography and endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography revealed no stenosis of the common and intrahepatic bile ducts. We suspected carcinoma of the gallbladder without lymph node metastasis and invasion to the common bile duct. We guessed it to be resectable and performed open laparotomy. At operation, the fundus of the gallbladder was adherent to the transverse colon, but no lymph node and distant metastases were detected. Therefore, we performed curative cholecystectomy with partial colectomy. Histopathology and immunostaining showed coexistence of an adenocarcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma and sarcomatous tumor of spindle-shaped cell, as well as transition zones between these tumors. We diagnosed stage I pleomorphic carcinoma of the gallbladder. No recurrence has been observed for one and a half years. The biological behavior of pleomorphic carcinoma of the gallbladder remains unknown. It will be necessary to accumulate more case reports of this tumor in order to define diagnostic criteria.
