We have focused on determining the range of oxidative stress biomarkers and their dynamic changes in patients at different time points after the acute ischemic stroke (AIS). 82 patients with AIS were involved in our study and were tested: within 24 h from the onset of the attack (group A); at 7-day follow-up (group B); and at 3-month follow-up (group C). 81 gender and age matched volunteers were used as controls. Stroke patients in group A had significantly higher concentrations of plasma lipid peroxides and urine 8-isoprostanes when compared with controls. Protein carbonyls were not significantly different in any experimental group compared to controls. Antioxidant capacity of plasma was increased only in experimental group C. Activities of superoxide dismutase and catalase were elevated in all three experimental AIS groups compared to controls. Paraoxonase activity was reduced in groups A and B and unchanged in group C when compared to controls. Glutathione peroxide activity was elevated only in group A. Our results suggest that free radical damage is the highest within 24 h after the attack. During the next 3 months oxidative damage to lipids caused by free radicals is reduced due to activated antioxidant system.
