Bilateral animals that are externally symmetric in appearance often have internal organs that are asymmetric with respect to the left and right sides of their bodies. Two signals, Nodal and BMP, have been shown to establish this asymmetry during vertebrate embryogenesis. We investigate here whether the same mechanisms that establish left-right patterning in vertebrates are conserved in invertebrate animals, specifically in the California purple sea urchin. This sea urchin passes through various stages in its lifecycle before developing to adulthood, including a feeding larva stage in which the tissue that goes on to form the adult, the so-called adult rudiment, forms on the left side. Previous studies have shown that right-sided Nodal signaling in sea urchins prevents the formation of the adult rudiment. In this study, we show that BMP signaling is activated on the left side and is required for the development of this left-sided structure. We also demonstrate that Nodal signaling blocks BMP activity and induces apoptosis of the tissue that forms the adult rudiment on the right side. We propose that the roles of Nodal and BMP signals in establishing left-right asymmetry are evolutionarily conserved.
