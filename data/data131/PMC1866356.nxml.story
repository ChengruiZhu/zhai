The cerebral cortex is the region of the brain whose intricate connectivity and physiology is thought to subserve most computations required for effective action in mammals. Through biophysically realistic computer simulation and experimental recordings in brain tissue, the authors show how a specific combination of physiological mechanisms often found in neurons of the cortex transforms an input signal into another signal that represents the rate of change of the slower components of the input. This is the first report of a neurobiological implementation of an approximate mathematical derivative in the cortex. Further, such a signal integrates naturally into a neurobiologically simple network that is able to generate a linear prediction of its inputs. Anticipation of information is a primary concern of spatially extended organisms which are subject to neural delays, and it has been demonstrated at various different levels: from the retina to sensori-motor integration. We present here a simple and general mechanism for anticipation that can operate incrementally within local circuits of the cortex, to compensate for time-consuming computations and conduction delays and thus contribute to effective real-time action.
