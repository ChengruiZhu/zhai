This study will be conducted in a mixed surgical and medical ICU at Hôtel-Dieu de Lévis, Quebec, Canada. We plan to involve all 5 intensivists and recruit at least 20 alert and oriented patients admitted to the ICU and their family members if available. In the first phase of this study, we will observe 3 weeks of daily interactions between patients, families, intensivists, and other allied health professionals. We will specifically observe 5 dyads of attending intensivists and alert and oriented patients discussing goals of care concerning CPR to understand how a patient DA could support this decision. We will also conduct individual interviews with the 5 intensivists to identify their needs concerning the implementation of a DA. In the second phase of the study, we will build a first prototype based on the needs identified in Phase I. We will start by translating an existing DA entitled “Cardiopulmonary resuscitation: a decision aid for patients and their families.” We will then adapt this tool to the needs we identified in Phase I and archive this first prototype in a wiki. Building on the wiki’s programming architecture, we intend to integrate the Good Outcome Following Attempted Resuscitation risk calculator into our DA to determine personal risks and benefits of CPR for each patient. We will then present the first prototype to 5 new patient-intensivist dyads. Feedback about content and visual presentation will be collected from the intensivists through short interviews while longer interviews will be conducted with patients and their family members to inform the visual design and content of the next prototype. After each rapid prototyping cycle, 2 researchers will perform qualitative content analysis of data collected through interviews and direct observations. We will attempt to solve all content and visual design issues identified before moving to the next round of prototyping. In all, we will conduct 3 prototyping cycles with a total of 15 patient-intensivist dyads.
