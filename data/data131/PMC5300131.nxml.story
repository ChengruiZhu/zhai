Surgical and, more recently, bronchoscopic lung volume reduction is the only available treatments for patients with advanced stage emphysema. Several large-scale, clinical studies have outlined appropriate selection criteria based on patient outcomes; however, the underlying mechanisms determining disease progression and response to these treatments are not well-understood. To answer this question, we have developed a network model of the lung to compare immediate and long-term response to each treatment. This approach allows us to directly study macroscopic changes in function related to microscopic changes in the local structural and mechanical environment. In addition, it facilitates direct comparisons between surgical and bronchoscopic lung volume reduction given identical initial conditions, which is not feasible in a clinical study. We propose here a mechanism suggesting that lung volume reduction efficacy is intimately linked to changes in microscopic force heterogeneity within the lung. Such an understanding of the mechanisms driving emphysema has the potential to greatly improve current therapies for this condition through more rationalized, patient-specific treatment strategies.
