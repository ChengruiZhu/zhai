This study aimed to analyze an effect of the kinetic variables and postural stability between bilateral in lower limbs by participation of Oreum trekking exercise program and subjects participated were composed of adult male and female subjects (n=14) of 20s. Experiment was performed with the drop landing which can evaluate postural stability and kinetic variables between bilateral in lower limbs. peak vertical force (PVF) value showed significant difference with the less in case of post than before participation of Oreum trekking exercise. Also PVF of bilateral in lower limbs did not showed significant difference, and too the effect of interaction. vertical stability index (VSI) and dynamic postural stability index (DPSI) showed significant difference with improvement of postural stability by Oreum trekking, but did not between bilateral in the limbs. Particularly the result of one-way analysis of variance due to VSIâ€™s effect of interaction, showed the more influence on the improvement of postural stability in left leg after participation of Oreum trekking exercise. When consideration the above, the analysis result on asymmetric index of bilateral in lower limbs showed more symmetric pattern in post than before participation of Oreum trekking exercise program.
