FXYD3 expression is upregulated in numerous cancer cell types. The present study compared the FXDY3 expression in normal endometrium, premalignant lesion and endometrial cancer tissue samples, and investigated the correlation between FXDY3 expression and clinicopathological features. FXYD3 expression was analyzed by streptavidin-peroxidase immunohistochemistry in 21 normal endometrial tissue samples, 18 atypical endometrial hyperplasia samples and 50 tissues obtained from patients diagnosed with endometrial cancer. The percentage of FXYD3-positive cell expression in the normal endometrium, atypical hyperplasia and endometrial cancer tissues samples was 0, 22, and 26%, respectively. The differences between the atypical hyperplasia and endometrial cancer groups were statistically significant when compared with the normal group (P=0.007 and P=0.037, respectively). There was no significant difference between the atypical hyperplasia and endometrial cancer groups. The percentage of FXYD3-positive cells correlated with the fertility frequency (P<0.05). In conclusion, FXYD3 is a potential biomarker for endometrial cancer, and its upregulation may be an early event in endometrial carcinoma progression. In addition, FXYD3 expression in endometrial carcinoma correlates with fertility frequency.
