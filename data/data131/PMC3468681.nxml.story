Intracellular heat shock protein (Hsp) 27 is a potent anti-apoptotic factor that, among other activities, prevents the binding of membrane receptor Fas to its ligand FasL. However, the potential role of extracellular Hsp27 and possibilities to control it have not been clarified. Moreover, there are no data on relations between Hsp27, sFas/sFasL system, matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) and their tissue inhibitors (TIMPs) in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD)â€”neither children nor adults. The aim of this study was to evaluate serum concentrations of Hsp27 and their potential regulators (sFas, sFasL, MMP-7, TIMP-1) in children with CKD and on chronic dialysis. Twenty-six CKD children stage 5 still on conservative treatment, 19 patients on hemodialysis (HD), 22 children on automated peritoneal dialysis (APD), and 30 controls were examined. Serum concentrations of Hsp27, sFas, sFasL, MMP-7, and TIMP-1 were assessed by ELISA. Median values of Hsp27 were significantly elevated in all dialyzed patients vs. those in pre-dialysis period and vs. controls, the highest values being observed in subjects on HD. Regression analysis revealed that MMP-7, TIMP-1, sFas, and sFasL were the best predictors of Hsp27 concentrations in dialyzed patients. Children with CKD are prone to Hsp27 dysfunction, aggravated by the dialysis commencement, and more pronounced in patients on hemodialysis. Correlations between Hsp27 and examined parameters suggest the potential role for Hsp27 as a marker of cell damage in the pediatric population on chronic dialysis.
