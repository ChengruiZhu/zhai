Glucose homeostasis is one of the central liver functions. The liver extracts glucose from the blood when plasma glucose levels are high and produces glucose when plasma glucose levels are low. To fulfill this function the liver is organized in smallest functional units, the sinusoidal tissue units (STUs). These STUs consist of a single sinusoid surrounded by linear arranged hepatocytes. Liver zonation describes the spatial separation of metabolic pathways along the STUs. As blood flows through the sinusoid the plasma nutrient and hormone composition changes and in conjunction with the heterogeneous endowment of metabolic enzymes this leads to big differences in the metabolic performance of hepatocytes depending on their position within the sinusoid. This makes liver zonation and blood flow two central determinants for the functional output of the liver. In this work we present a tissue model of hepatic carbohydrate metabolism that combines liver zonation and microperfusion within the STU. We show that structural properties, enzymatic properties and regional bloodflow are equally important for the understanding of liver functionality. With our work we provide a true multi-scale model bridging the scale from the cellular to the tissue level.
