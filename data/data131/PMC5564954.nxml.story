Adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells (ADSCs) were isolated from inguinal fat of adult Lewis rats (n= 8) and expanded to passage 2 (P2). To induce degenerative changes in a rat modeling a massive chronic rotator cuff tear, the supraspinatus and infraspinatus tendons were transected bilaterally near their bony insertion and the corresponding muscle bellies were injected with 2.5 U botulinum toxin A (botox). Eight weeks later, tendons were repaired with or without augmentation at the tendon-bone interface. In particular, there were 5 groups ; (1) no repair (defect), (2) repair, (3) repair + fibrin, (4) repair + fibrin + ADSCs, (5) repair + fibrin + ADSCs + TGF-Î²3 (n=12 shoulders per condition). An equivalent cohort of animals received acute tendon transection (without botox injection) and immediate repair with or without augmentation. At 4 weeks following repair, animals were euthanized and the shoulders were harvested for analysis of bone morphometry, histology, and mechanical properties. Bone morphometry of the humeral head including; bone mineral density, bone volume percentage, and trabeculae number, thickness, and spacing was determined using micro-computed tomography. Statistical analyses included 2-way ANOVA with Tukey post-hoc tests. Analyses of histology and mechanical properties are ongoing.
