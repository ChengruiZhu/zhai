One of the goals of theoretical systems neuroscience is to connect parameters of neuronal activity observed in electrophysiological experiments, such as cell firing rates, frequencies and amplitudes of the brain rhythms, with cognitive phenomena that emerge at the scale of large groups of cells. In previous work, we proposed an approach for modeling one such phenomenon: spatial learning in the mammalian hippocampus. This approach rested on the hypothesis that hippocampal neurons encode a rough-and-ready topological map of an environment, whereas geometric details likely come from multiple inputs from other brain regions. A key property of this model is that it allows us to estimate the effect produced by different parameters of neuronal activity on spatial learning. In particular, it we showed that theta oscillations strongly enhance the ability of the place cell ensembles to learn topologically accurate spatial maps. In this work, we show that synchronization of neuronal spiking activity by the other major component of the oscillating extracellular cell potential—the gamma rhythm—also enhances both spatial learning and the retrieval of spatial memories at the physiological timescale.
