To develop an animal model for antimyeloperoxidase (MPO)-associated necrotizing crescentic glomerulonephritis (NCGN), we immunized Brown Norway rats with MPO and localized a neutrophil lysosomal enzyme extract, primarily consisting of MPO and elastinolytic enzymes, plus H2O2, the substrate of MPO, to the glomerular basement membrane (GBM). Upon immunization rats developed antibodies and positive skin tests to MPO. After unilateral perfusion of the left kidney with the lysosomal enzyme extract and H2O2, MPO and immunoglobulin (Ig)G localized transiently along the GMB. At the time of maximal inflammation, at 4 and 10 d after perfusion, MPO, IgG, and C3 could not be detected anymore. MPO-immunized rats perfused with the lysosomal enzyme extract and H2O2, in contrast to control-immunized and/or control-perfused rats, developed a proliferative GN characterized by intra- and extracapillary cell proliferation, ruptured Bowman's capsule, periglomerular granulomatous inflammation, and formation of giant cells. Monocytes, polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMN), and to a far lesser extent T cells were found in the glomeruli. Interstitial infiltrates consisted of monocytes, PMN, and T cells. Granulomatous vasculitis of small vessels was found at 10 d after perfusion. The proliferative NCGN in this rat model closely resembles human anti-MPO- associated pauci-immune NCGN, and enables the study of the pathophysiology of anti-MPO-associated NCGN.
