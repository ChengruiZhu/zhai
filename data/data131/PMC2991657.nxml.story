The need for early ambulation for caring of the neonate by mothers makes postoperative pain management after cesarean delivery unique. Favorable results have been observed with buprenorphine, clonidine and bupivacaine as epidural analgesics. This prospective, randomised triple blind control study was carried out among 112 lower segment caesarean segment (LSCS) patients, divided into three groups, to assess the analgesic efficacy and side effects of epidural analgesia, with an intermittent top up of (i) bupivacaine (0.125%) and buprenorphine (0.075 mg) (ii) bupivacaine (0.125%) and clonidine (37.5 microgram) and (iii) bupivacaine (0.125%) alone, in LSCS cases. The demographic characteristics (age, weight and height) of the three groups were comparable and the differences were not statistically significant. The mean duration of the analgesia was significantly longer in the group one patients receiving buprenorphine plus bupivacaine (690 ± 35 minutes) and it was lowest in group three patients receiving bupivacaine (170 ± 31 minutes) alone. The mean highest pain score (VAS scale) was significantly lower (3.4 ± 0.6) in group one patients and it was highest in group three (6.7 ± 0.8) patients. Requirement of continuation of epidural analgesia after 15 hours of operation and requirement of diclonfenac injections as well as incidence of itching and pruritus was significantly lower in group one patients. Incidence of nausea and vomiting was the lowest in group one patients. Incidence of respiratory depression, sedation and hypotension were nil in all three group of patients. Epidural buprenorphine combined with bupivacaine produced significantly longer duration and better quality of analgesia than bupivacaine combined with clonidine or bupivacaine alone, and it was safe in LSCS patients, for post-operative analgesia.
