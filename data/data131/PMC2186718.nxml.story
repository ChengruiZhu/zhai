Two types of lymphocytic choriomeningitis (LCM) viruses were studied which, upon intracerebral injection into adult C3H mice, provoked either (a) acute fatal central nervous system (CNS) disease or (b) life- long persistent infection. Both virus types, (a) aggressive and (b) docile, had been found to induce LCM-specific lymphocytes with comparable in vitro lytic activity (11). Because the requirement for T cells in the development of adult LCM disease has been extensively documented, we sought other reasons for the lack of acute disease in mice infected with docile virus. A striking correlation was found between the outcome of the infection and spread of virus to visceral organs. Adoptive transfer experiments showed that a 300-plaque forming unit inoculum of docile virus induced a population of T cells in donor mice fully capable of causing CNS disease in identically infected recipients. This disease causing ability was lost if the interaction was delayed beyond 3 d after infection of the recipients, but could be preserved by lowering the size of the viral inoculum in the recipients. Furthermore, without adoptive transfer, very low intracerebral doses of docile virus (which mimicked the normally slow spread of aggressive virus) were lethal. On the other hand, very high doses of aggressive virus, which mimicked the normally rapid spread of docile virus, did not induce fatal CNS disease. The results suggest that rapid dissemination of the LCM infection creates multiple target organs which divert the focused lethal T cell attack on the brain.
