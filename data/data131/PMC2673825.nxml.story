Uveitis is a potentially sight-threatening inflammatory eye disease caused by multiple infectious and non-infectious etiologies for which the standard of care involves corticosteroids or various immunomodulary therapy (IMT) drugs. These available treatments, although effective, may cause significant morbidity and sometimes mortality in uveitis patients due to their toxic side-effects and the necessity of long-term therapy to prevent recurrences. In order to avoid the systemic toxicity of corticosteroids and IMT or the repeated injections of local steroids necessary to control ocular inflammation, and to prevent development of cumulative damage resulting from recurrent episodes of inflammation, researchers have developed a number of local corticosteroid sustained-release devices that can be implanted directly into the vitreous of the eye, at the site of the inflammatory disease. Preliminary studies of such a device, the fluocinolone acetonide (Retisertâ„¢) implant, have shown significant reductions in the number of inflammatory episodes and decreased reliance on systemic corticosteroids or other IMT. This review explores the current research evaluating the fluocinolone sustained-release intravitreal implant in the treatment of posterior uveitis and the implications for its future use on a wider scale.
