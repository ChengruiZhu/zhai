The novel Ras-like small GTPase Rin is expressed prominently in adult neurons, and binds calmodulin (CaM) through its COOH-terminal–binding motif. It might be involved in calcium/CaM-mediated neuronal signaling, but Rin-mediated signal transduction pathways have not yet been elucidated. Here, we show that expression of Rin induces neurite outgrowth without nerve growth factor or mitogen-activated protein kinase activation in rat pheochromocytoma PC12 cells. Rin-induced neurite outgrowth was markedly inhibited by coexpression with dominant negative Rac/Cdc42 protein or CaM inhibitor treatment. We also found that expression of Rin elevated the endogenous Rac/Cdc42 activity. Rin mutant proteins, in which the mutation disrupted association with CaM, failed to induce neurite outgrowth irrespective of Rac/Cdc42 activation. Disruption of endogenous Rin function inhibited the neurite outgrowth stimulated by forskolin and extracellular calcium entry through voltage-dependent calcium channel evoked by KCl. These findings suggest that Rin-mediated neurite outgrowth signaling requires not only endogenous Rac/Cdc42 activation but also Rin–CaM association, and that endogenous Rin is involved in calcium/CaM-mediated neuronal signaling pathways.
