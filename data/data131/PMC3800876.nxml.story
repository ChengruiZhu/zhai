Male wistar rats of 8 10 weeks and weighing 180 230 gm were used. After acclimatization, streptozotocin was administered by intravenous bolus injection. Stabilization period of 14 days followed screening with Glucose Tolerance Test. 24 rats with fasting glucose > 130mg/dl during the GTT profile were considered as diabetic and randomized into 3 groups. 8 untreated wistar rats were considered as non diabetic controls. Group I, the Non diabetic control group received sterile deionized water in equivalent volumes to the treatment. Group II, Hyperglycemic vehicle control group, received Streptozotocin and sterile deionized water in equivalent volumes to the treatment dose. Group III, the Hyperglycemic rats receiving DB14201 250mg/kg/day, and Group IV, the Hyperglycemic rats receiving DB14201 500mg/kg/day, also received Streptozotocin. Observations comprised of mortality, general cage side and clinical observations, and weekly blood glucose estimation. Biochemical parameters estimated on day 1 and day 15 were Serum Insulin Levels, Serum Triglycerides, Total Cholesterol Levels, Serum Urea, Serum Creatinine, SGPT levels, SGOT levels, Hepatic glycogen content, Polyuria, Polydipsia, Polyphagia, Diarrhea and , Body weight.
