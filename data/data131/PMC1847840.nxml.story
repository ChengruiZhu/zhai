We metabolize many hormones, drugs, and bioactive chemicals and toxins from the environment. One family of enzymes that participate in the metabolic process consists of the cytosolic sulfotransferases, or SULTs. SULTs have a variety of mechanisms of actionâ€”sometimes they inactivate the biological activity of the chemical (e.g., in the case of estrogen). At other times, the enzymes make the chemical more toxic (e.g., for certain carcinogens). Humans have 12 distinct SULT enzymes. Determining how each of these human enzymes recognizes and distinguishes between the thousands of chemicals we confront each day is essential for understanding hormone regulation, assessing environmental risk, and eventually developing better, more-effective drugs. We have studied the human SULT family of enzymes to profile which small molecules are recognized by each enzyme. We also visualized and compared the detailed structural features that determine which enzyme interacts with which molecule. By studying the entire family, we discovered new ways in which chemicals interact with each enzyme. Furthermore, we identified new inhibitors and inhibitory mechanisms. Finally, we discovered functions for many of the human enzymes that were previously uncharacterized.
