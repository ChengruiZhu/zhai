Hypercoagulable disorders are now diagnosed more frequently than before. These patients are, usually, managed with multiple anticoagulant and antiplatelet medications. Left unmonitored and unevaluated, there can be disastrous haemorrhagic or thrombotic complications. Appropriate perioperative and anaesthetic management of these patients will invite an aetiological diagnosis, severity analysis and the on-going treatment review. Different assays, thromboelastography and molecular cytogenetics have helped to diagnose these conditions precisely and thus guide the long-term management. Besides this, there are varieties of clinical conditions that will predispose to the hypercoagulability. These need to be defined and classified in order to offer a suitable therapeutic option. Pregnancy is one such important condition and can have more than one responsible factor favouring hypercoagulability. With such diverse kinds of disorders, it would be essential to note the anaesthetic implications, to avoid adverse perioperative outcomes. Available evidence based guidelines will help to make the therapeutic approach more precise. Selection of the appropriate technique of anaesthesia, offering the appropriate anticoagulation bridging as necessary and defining an appropriate interval and time for the intervention will help to minimise the complications.
