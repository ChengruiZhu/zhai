Epithelia cover all the surfaces of and the cavities throughout the body and serve as barriers between the organism and its external environment. Epithelial differentiation requires the coordination in space and time of several mechanisms that ultimately lead to the acquisition of distinctive epithelial features, including apical-basal polarity, specialised cell-cell junctions, and columnar shape. Epithelial differentiation also induces the reorganisation of three cytoskeletal networks: actin filaments, intermediate filaments, and microtubules. In simple epithelia, cadherins and their cytoplasmic binding partners catenins play a crucial role in connecting cell-cell junctions to the actin cytoskeleton. The cadherin extracellular domain forms adhesive contacts between adjacent cells, and their cytoplasmic tail indirectly binds the actin-binding protein α-catenin, thus linking cell-cell junctions to the underlying actin cytoskeleton. We report here an additional role of α-catenin in remodelling microtubules during epithelial differentiation. In most epithelial cells, microtubules are organised as parallel bundles aligned along the apico-basal axis and as apical and basal plasma membrane-associated networks. We demonstrate that the microtubule-binding protein CAP350, which is only localised at the centrosome in most cells, is also recruited at cell–cell junctions in epithelial cells through its binding to α-catenin. In the absence of junctional CAP350, microtubules are unable to reorganise in bundles, and cells do not acquire columnar shape. Our results suggest that recruitment of centrosomal proteins to cell-cell junctions could be a general mechanism to control microtubule reorganisation in neighbour cells during epithelial differentiation.
