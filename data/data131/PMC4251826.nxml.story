Many of the tissues in our bodies are built up around complex arrays of elongated cellular tubes, which permit the entry, exit, and transport of essential molecules such as oxygen, glucose, and water. These tubes often arise as short buds, which elongate dramatically as the organ grows. We sought to understand the mechanisms that govern such transformations of shape using the fly renal tubule as a model. We find that elongation of this tissue is predominantly driven by cell rearrangement. Cells move around the circumference of the tubule, intercalating with each other so that the cell number around the lumen reduces, while increasing along the length of the tube. Our next question was how cells sense the direction in which they should move. We show that cells orient their position in the tissue by reading a signal sent out by a specific pair of cells at the tip of each tube. Cells use this directional information to make polarised movements through the asymmetric activity of the cell's contractile machinery. We find that the activity of myosin—the motor protein that regulates contraction—is pulsatile and polarised within the cell. This activity shortens the cells' circumferential lengths, so that cells move past each other around the tube circumference, thereby intercalating and producing tube elongation. We go on to show that excretory physiology is severely impaired when elongation fails, underlining the importance of sculpting organs with appropriate dimensions.
