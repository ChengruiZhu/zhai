How a protein is controlled is intimately linked to its function. Therefore, evolution can drive the functional divergence of proteins by tweaking their regulation, even if enzymatic capacities are preserved. Changes in posttranslational regulation (protein phosphorylation, degradation, subcellular localization, etc.) could therefore represent key mechanisms in functional divergence and lead to different phenotypic outcomes. Since disordered protein regions contain sites of protein modification and interaction (known as short linear motifs) and evolve rapidly relative to domains encoding enzymatic functions, these regions are good candidates to harbour sequence changes that underlie changes in function. In this study, we develop a statistical framework to identify changes in rate of evolution specific to protein regulatory sequences and identify hundreds of short linear motifs in disordered regions that are likely to have diverged after the whole-genome duplication in budding yeast. We show that these divergent motifs are much more frequent in paralogs than in single-copy proteins, and that they are more frequent in duplicate pairs that have functionally diverged. Our analysis suggests that changes in short linear motifs in disordered protein regions could be important molecular mechanisms of functional divergence after gene duplication.
