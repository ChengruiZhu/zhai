In movement control, online feedback compensation of internal noise directly affects the statistics of the movement trajectory, namely the development of the variance during the movement and the correlation of the effectors position during the movement and its end position. We used here the statistics of the movement trajectory to gain inference about features of the underlying noise sources and of the actual feedback mechanism. We developed a method to analytically determine the statistics of movement trajectories resulting from noise entered inside and outside of an internal feedback loop and obtained a general model of noise in the output of feedback controlled motor systems. In detail we consider here the special case of saccade control and show that the number of free model parameters is small enough to identify the contribution of the noise components inside and outside of the loop, and the strength of the feedback. The model was fitted to the inter-trial saccade variability observed in five rhesus monkeys (Macaca mulatta). By comparing our parameter estimates for saccades under control conditions to saccades executed during inactivation of the fastigial nucleus (the main cerebellar output to the brainstem saccade generator) we quantify the role of the cerebellum in feedback motor control.
