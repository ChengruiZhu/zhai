Meta and/or combined QTL analysis from multiple studies can improve quantitative trait loci (QTL) position estimates compared to the individual experiments. Hereby we present results of a meta-analysis of QTL on chicken chromosome 9, 14 and 18 using data from three separate experiments and joint QTL analysis for chromosome 14 and 18. Meta QTL analysis uses information from multiple QTLs studies. Joint QTL analysis is based on combining raw data from different QTL experimental populations. QTLs under the study were related to specific antibody response to keyhole lymphet hemocyanin (KLH), and natural antibodies to environmental antigens, lipopolisaccharide (LPS) and lipoteichoic acid (LTA). Meta QTL analysis resulted in narrowing down the confidence interval for two QTLs on GGA14. The first one for natural antibodies against LTA and the second one for specific antibody response toward KLH. Also, a confidence interval of a QTL for natural antibodies against LPS located on GGA18 was narrowed down. Combined QTL analysis was successful for two QTLs: for specific antibody response toward KLH on GGA14, and for natural antibodies against LPS on GGA18. The greatest statistical power for QTL detection in joint analysis was achieved when raw data from segregating halfâ€“sib families from different populations under the study was used.
