In recent decades, emerging evidence demonstrates that ultraconserved elements (UCEs) encoding noncoding RNAs serve as regulators of gene expression. Until now, the role of uc.189 in human cancers remains undefined and the clinical significance of uc.189 in gynecological cancers remains unknown. This study was to identify the prognostic value of uc.189 expression in gynecological cancers. Tissue microarrays were constructed with 243 samples including 116 cervical squamous cell carcinomas (CSCCs), 98 endometrial adenocarcinomas (EACs), 29 ovarian cystoadenocarcinomas(OCAs), and corresponding normal tissues. In CSCC, uc.189 expression was increased in 78.5% of cases (91/116), decreased in 4.3% (5/116), and unchanged in 17.2% (20/116). In EAC its expression was increased in 74.5% (73/98), decreased in 3.1% (3/98), and unchanged in 22.4% (22/98). Expression of uc.189 was increased in 23, and unchanged/decreased in 6, of 29 cases of ovarian cystoadenocarcinomas. Univariate and multivariate Cox regression analysis demonstrated that over-expression of uc.189 predicted poor prognosis in CSCC and EAC. Thus, these findings suggested uc.189 might be an evaluating prognosis marker of gynecological tumors.
