Prostate cancer (PCa) is a common hormone-dependent malignancy associated with the development of skeletal metastases. This is due to the increased expression of a number of growth factors, cytokines, and proteases which collectively drive the metastatic cascade in general and increased propensity to develop skeletal metastasis in particular. While a number of signaling pathways have been implicated in PCa progression, the highly complex wnt/β-catenin pathway is unique due to its ability to regulate gene expression, cell invasion, migration, survival, proliferation, and differentiation to contribute in the initiation and progression of PCa. Members of the wnt family bind to the Frizzle proteins or lipoprotein-related receptor proteins 5, 6 (LRP5, -6) to activate this key pathway. In the current study, we have investigated the role of wnt/β-catenin pathway in PCa progression, skeletal metastasis, and gene expression using the dominant negative plasmid of LRP5 (DN-LRP5) and human PCa cells PC-3. Inactivation of LRP5 resulted in mesenchymal to epithelial shift, lack of translocation of β-catenin to cell surface, increased tumor cell proliferation, decreased colony formation, migration and invasion
