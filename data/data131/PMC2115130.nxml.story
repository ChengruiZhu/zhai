In the low density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor system, blocks in intracellular movement of a cell surface receptor result from naturally occurring mutations. These mutations occur in patients with familial hypercholesterolemia. One class of mutant LDL receptor genes (class 2 mutations) produces a receptor that is synthesized and glycosylated in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) but does not reach the cell surface. These receptors contain serine/threonine-linked (O-linked) carbohydrate chains with core N-acetylgalactosamine residues and asparagine-linked (N-linked) carbohydrate chains of the high mannose type that are only partially trimmed. To determine the site of blockage in transport, we used electron microscope immunohistochemistry to compare the intracellular location of LDL receptors in normal human fibroblasts with their location in class 2 mutant fibroblasts. In normal cells, LDL receptors were located in coated pits, coated vesicles, endosomes, multivesicular bodies, and portions of the Golgi complex. In contrast, the mutant receptors in class 2 cells were almost entirely confined to rough ER and irregular extensions of the rough ER. Metabolic labeling studies with [3H]glucosamine confirmed that these mutant receptors contain core O-linked sugars, suggesting that the enzymes that attach these residues are located in the rough ER or the transitional zone of the ER. These studies establish that naturally occurring mutations in cell surface receptors can cause the receptors to remain trapped in the ER, thereby preventing their normal function and producing a genetic disease.
