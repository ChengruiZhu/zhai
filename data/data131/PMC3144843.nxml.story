Bronchodilators are the cornerstone of severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) treatment to improve airflow, symptoms, exercise tolerance, and exacerbations. There is convincing evidence that regular treatment with long-acting bronchodilators is more effective and convenient than treatment with short-acting bronchodilators. Long-acting β-2-agonists include the twice-daily drugs formoterol and salmeterol and, more recently, once-daily indacaterol. Studies with head-to-head comparisons of long-acting bronchodilators are scant, but novel data from controlled trials with the once-daily β(2)-agonist indacaterol indicate superior bronchodilation and clinical efficacy of indacaterol at recommended doses over twice-daily long-acting β(2)-agonists, and at least equipotent bronchodilation compared with once-daily tiotropium. The recent therapeutic developments in COPD underscore a shift from short-acting bronchodilators with multiple dosings per day to reduced dosing frequency and prolonged duration of action, including once-daily treatment, with more consistent effects on various clinical outcomes. This review summarizes relevant clinical data for twice-daily β-2-agonists in COPD, and further focuses on novel data for once-daily indacaterol, including head-to-head comparison trials.
