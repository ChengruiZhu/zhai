As genetically engineered mutant mice deficient in single genes are usually generated on a C57BL/6 background, to study mast cell trafficking in mutant mice, we initially investigated whether mast cells accumulated in bronchi in C57BL/6 mice challenged with OVA allergen acutely or chronically for 1 to 3 months. The total number of bronchial mast cells were quantitated using toluidine blue staining in airways of different sizes, i.e. , small (<90 µm), medium (90–155 µm), or large (>150 µm) airways. Non-OVA challenged and acute OVA challenged mice (C57BL/6 and BALB/c) had no detectable bronchial mast cells. Chronic OVA challenge in BALB/c mice for 1 or 3 months induced a significant increase in the number of bronchial mast cells in small-, medium-, and large-sized airways but minimal change in the number of bronchial mast cells in C57BL/6 mice. Both BALB/c and C57BL/6 mice developed significant lung eosinophilia following acute or chronic OVA challenge. Studies of IL-9-deficient mice on a BALB/c background demonstrated a significant increase in the number of bronchial mast cells in IL-9-deficient mice suggesting that IL-9 was not required for the bronchial accumulation of mast cells. Overall, these studies demonstrate that the chronic OVA challenge protocol we have utilized in BALB/c mice provides a model to study the mechanism of bronchial mast cell accumulation and that bronchial mast cell accumulation in chronic OVA challenged mice is independent of IL-9 in this model.
