The primary aim of this study was to explore the safety and feasibility of laparoscopic-assisted synchronous bowel anastomoses (LSBA) for synchronous colorectal cancer (SCRC). All patients who underwent LSBA for SCRC were retrospectively reviewed and analyzed for clinical and pathological features, technical feasibility and short-term as well as long-term oncological outcomes. Between July 2008 and January 2012, a series of 11 consecutive SCRC patients underwent LSBA. Six patients underwent laparoscopic-assisted right hemicolectomy and anterior resection. Five patients had laparoscopic-assisted right hemicolectomy and sigmoidectomy. There were no intraoperative complications that required open conversions. Mean operation time was 233 (range, 195–285) minutes, and mean estimated blood loss was 224 (range, 100–300) mL. The postoperative course of the patients was uneventful with the mean return to oral intake was 6.9 (range 5–12) days, and mean length of hospital stay was 12.6 (range 9–17) days. All surgical wounds showed good cosmetic outcome, and the mean incision length was 4.1 (range 3.5-5.0) cm. During a median follow-up period of 76 months, no local tumor recurrences were found. LSBA is a potentially feasible and safe procedure for SCRC when performed by an experienced surgeon. Further large clinical controlled trials are warranted to confirm the findings.
