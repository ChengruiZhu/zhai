Participants in all groups were similar in terms of gender, age, weight, height, and Mallampati class. The mean ± SD of SBPs (105.62 ± 12.12, 112.90 ± 12.2, and 112.48 ± 15.14 mm Hg, respectively for ETT, LMA-C, and LMA-S) and DBPs (64.64 ± 10.23, 73.78 ± 9.70, and 71.20 ± 12.27 mm Hg, respectively for ETT, LMA-C, and LMA-S) were significantly lower in the ETT group compared to LMA groups 5 minutes after device insertion (P < 0.01 for SBPs and P < 0.001 for DBPs); however these values were lower than the baseline values in all groups. There were no differences in the mean SBP and DBPs between the three groups at the other time points. The mean ± SD heart rates in the ETT group, compared to the LMA-C and LMA-S groups, were considerably higher in the first minute (100.06 ± 18.27, 82.50 ± 10.52, and 82.00 ± 13.60 bpm, respectively for ETT, LMA-C, and LMA-S), third minute (91.04 ± 17.12, 78.84 ± 11.23, and 78.90 ± 13.41 bpm, respectively for ETT, LMA-C, and LMA-S) and fifth minute (85.82 ± 16.01, 75.78 ± 11.73, and 75.04 ± 13.90 bpm, respectively for ETT, LMA-C, and LMA-S) after intubation (P < 0.001). There were no significant differences between the LMA-C and LMA-S groups in terms of hemodynamic parameters.
