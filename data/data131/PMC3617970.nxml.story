The relatively new term dermatoporosis refers to chronic deficiencies in the skin's functions in the elderly population due to aging. This syndrome is marked by chronic cutaneous fragility clinically represented by skin atrophy, senile purpura, stellate pseudoscars, skin laceration, and dissecting hematoma of the skin. In this paper, we report three cases of sacral pressure ulcers presenting primary dermatoporosis on the forearms. Case 1 was a 74-year-old male who presented with a stage IV sacral pressure ulcer. The signs of dermatoporosis appeared on the forearms. Histopathology of the lesions revealed epidermal thinning with loss of rete ridges. Azan and Elastica van Gieson staining demonstrated the degeneration of the dermal collagen fibers and elastic fibers, respectively. In spite of 6 months of treatment, the ulcer failed to heal sufficiently. Case 2 was a 74-year-old male and Case 3 was a 97-year-old female. Both cases presented with a stage II sacral pressure ulcer and dermatoporosis on the forearms. Histopathological examinations and the clinical course of the wound could not be ascertained in Cases 2 and 3. None of the patients had previously used corticosteroids. The presence of a primary dermatoporosis on the forearms in these cases may be associated with the increased risk of pressure ulcer development.
