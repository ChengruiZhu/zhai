We present a technique—based on the Lutz, Winston, and Maleki test used in stereotactic linear accelerator radiosurgery—for verifying whether proton beams are being delivered within the required spatial coincidence with the gantry mechanical isocenter. Our procedure uses a proton beam that is collimated by a circular aperture at its central axis and is then intercepted by a small steel sphere rigidly supported by the patient couch. A laser tracker measurement system and a correction algorithm for couch position assures precise positioning of the steel sphere at the mechanical isocenter of the gantry. A film‐based radiation dosimetry technique, chosen for the good spatial resolution it achieves, records the proton dose distribution for optical image analysis. The optical image obtained presents a circular high‐dose region surrounding a lower‐dose area corresponding to the proton beam absorption by the steel sphere, thereby providing a measure of the beam alignment with the mechanical isocenter. We found the self‐developing Gafchromic EBT film (International Specialty Products, Wayne, NJ) and commercial Epson 10000 XL flatbed scanner (Epson America, Long Beach, CA) to be accurate and efficient tools. The positions of the gantry mechanical and proton beam isocenters, as recorded on film, were clearly identifiable within the scanning resolution used for routine alignment testing (0.17 mm per pixel). The mean displacement of the collimated proton beam from the gantry mechanical isocenter was
