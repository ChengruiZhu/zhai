About 30 to 46% of patients with major depressive disorder (MDD) fail to fully respond to initial antidepressants. Treatment-resistant depression (TRD) is a severely disabling disorder with no proven treatment options; novel treatment methods like rTMS can be used as augmentation to ongoing pharmacotherapy or as a solitary method of treatment. To evaluate the utility of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation as an augmenting method in TRD. In an open-label study, 21 patients with DSM-IV MDD without psychotic features who had failed to respond to an adequate trial of at least 2 antidepressants were given rTMS therapy for 4 weeks, keeping the dose of pre-existing antidepressants unchanged. High-frequency (10 Hz) stimulations were delivered over left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex at intensity of 110% of patient's motor threshold. Treatment response was defined as a reduction in score on the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HAM-D) from baseline to end of treatment. Secondary efficacy measures included scores on the Clinical Global Impressions-Change and -Severity scales. At the end of 4 weeks, 19 patients completed the 4-week study and were assessed. In ITT analysis, the mean HAM-D17 scores were reduced from 30.80±5.00 to 19.00±6.37 (
