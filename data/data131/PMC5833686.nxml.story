Recent studies show substantial growth-promoting properties of nicotine (NIC) in cancer, which is a combined outcome of genetic and epigenetic alterations. However, the role of epigenetic modifiers in response to NIC in breast cancer is less studied. In the present study, for the first time we have shown NIC-induced enhanced EZH2 expression. Six pairs of smoking-associated breast cancer patient tissues were analyzed. Samples from smoking breast cancer patients showed distinguished enhanced EZH2 expression in comparison to non-smoking ones. The upregulation in EZH2, which is due to NIC, was further confirmed in breast carcinoma cell lines using 10 µM NIC, 1 µM DZNepA, and EZH2si. The upregulation of EZH2 was concomitant with upregulation in Myc and α9-nAChR. The xenograft of breast cancer cells in BALB/c nude mice in the presence or absence of NIC showed significantly higher tumor uptake in the NIC injected group, which clearly demonstrates the effect of NIC in breast cancer progression. Interestingly, DZNepA considerably suppressed the NIC-mediated tumor growth. CHIP-qPCR assay confirmed the increased Myc enrichment on EZH2 promoter upon NIC treatment, thereby strengthening our findings that there exists an association between NIC, Myc, and EZH2. Overall, the present study identifies a strong association between NIC and EZH2 particularly in the progression of breast cancer in smokers through a novel axis involving nAChR and Myc. Moreover, the findings provide preliminary evidence suggesting potential of high level of EZH2 expression as a prognostic marker in smoking-associated breast cancer.
