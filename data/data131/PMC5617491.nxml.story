Recent studies have revealed that rottlerin is a natural chemical drug to exert its anti-cancer activity. However, the molecular mechanisms of rottlerin-induced tumor suppressive function have not been fully elucidated. Notch signaling pathway has been characterized to play a crucial role in tumorigenesis. Therefore, regulation of Notch pathway could be beneficial for the treatment of human cancer. The aims of our current study were to explore whether rottlerin could suppress Notch-1 expression, which leads to inhibition of cell proliferation, migration and invasion in nasopharyngeal carcinoma cells. We performed several approaches, such as CTG, Flow cytometry, scratch healing assay, transwell and Western blotting. Our results showed that rottlerin treatment inhibited cell growth, migration and invasion, and triggered apoptosis, and arrested cell cycle to G1 phase. Moreover, the expression of Notch-1 was obvious decreased in nasopharyngeal carcinoma cells after rottlerin treatment. Importantly, overexpression of Notch-1 promoted cell growth and invasion, whereas down-regulation of Notch-1 inhibited cell growth and invasion in nasopharyngeal carcinoma cells. Notably, we found the over-expression of Notch-1 could abrogate the anti-cancer function induced by rottlerin. Strikingly, our study implied that Notch-1 could be a useful target of rottlerin for the prevention and treatment of human nasopharyngeal carcinoma.
