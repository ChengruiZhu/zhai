Circulating tumor cells (CTCs) are used for metastasis surveillance in cancer patients, but low detection rates limit their use in colorectal cancer (CRC). We investigated the distribution of CTCs in peripheral and portal blood of CRC patients, and analyzed the relationship between serum tumor CEA/CA19-9 markers and CTCs blood levels. CTC levels detected in first reflux/portal vein blood were higher than in peripheral blood, and liver reduced CTCs amount. CTCs-positive patients had increased serum CEA and CA 19-9 levels, and the CEA and CA 19-9 levels correlated with the CTCs levels. Even in non-metastatic CRC patients with barely detectable CTCs in peripheral blood, serum CA 19-9 levels correlated with the CTC levels in first reflux/portal vein blood. These results demonstrate that CTC detection in the first reflux vein/portal vein blood is more sensitive than in peripheral blood, suggesting that clinical diagnosis using the CellSearch System should be based on the CTC detection in first reflux vein blood due to the high detection rates. In addition, our results indicate that serum CA 19-9 levels may serve as a diagnostic marker for further evaluation of CTC levels in portal blood.
