Leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) is indispensable to maintain the pluripotent state of mouse embryonic stem cells (ESCs), but the mechanisms underlying the role of LIF/STAT3 pathway are yet poorly understood. Here we first showed that the LIF/STAT3-regulated signaling pathway contributes to the maintenance of self-renewal and pluripotency of mouse ESCs by suppressing mTOR (mammalian target of rapamycin), which is necessary for early differentiation. When LIF is withdrawn from culture medium, the mTOR activity rapidly increases as detected by phosphorylation of its targets – ribosomal protein S6 and translation factor 4EBP1. In turn, suppression of STAT3 phosphorylation on Tyr-705 by a specific small molecule WP1066 also activates phosphorylation of the mTOR target S6 ribosomal protein. LIF removal strongly activates ERK activity indicating that ERK can be involved in either direct phosphorylation of mTOR or phosphorylation of an upstream negative regulator of mTOR – TSC1/TSC2 proteins. According to western blotting data, LIF withdrawal leads to phosphorylation of TSC2 protein thereby relieving its negative effect on mTOR activity. mTOR activation is accompanied by a decrease of pluripotent gene expression
