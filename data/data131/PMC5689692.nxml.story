) combined with carboplatin once every 3 weeks. If patients had stable disease or achieved a complete or partial tumor response after 4 courses of pemetrexed + carboplatin therapy, maintenance treatment with pemetrexed monotherapy was administered until either disease progression or intolerable toxicity occurred. The primary endpoint was progression-free survival, while secondary endpoints were the objective response rate, overall survival, and tolerability. A total of 105 elderly patients (median age, 71 years) with advanced lung adenocarcinoma were enrolled in the trial. The ORR with induction therapy was 36.2% and the disease control rate was 70.5%. Sixty-two patients (59.0%) subsequently received pemetrexed maintenance therapy. The median progression-free survival for all patients was 8.23 months (95% CI 5.85-10.62 months) and the median overall survival was 22.6 months (95% CI 20.09-25.11 months). Grade 3 or greater toxicities included neutropenia (15.3%), thrombocytopenia (9.5%), anemia (8.6%), leukopenia (4.8%), nausea (1.0%), vomiting (1.0%), and fatigue (1.0%). No treatment-related deaths occurred. These results indicate that pemetrexed combined with carboplatin therapy maintained by single-agent pemetrexed treatment of elderly patients with advanced non-squamous non-small-cell lung cancer was effective and tolerable.
