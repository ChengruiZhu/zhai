A special acrylic phantom designed for both magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and computed tomography (CT) was used to assess the geometric accuracy of MRI‚Äêbased stereotactic localization with the Leksell stereotactic head frame and localizer system. The acrylic phantom was constructed in the shape of a cube, 164 mm in each dimension, with three perpendicular arrays of solid acrylic rods, 5 mm in diameter and spaced 30 mm apart within the phantom. Images from two MR scanners and a CT scanner were obtained with the same Leksell head frame placement. Using image fusion provided by the Leksell GammaPlan (LGP) software, the coordinates of the intraphantom rod positions from two MRI scanners were compared to that of CT imaging. The geometric accuracy of MR images from the Siemens scanner was greatly improved after the implementation of a special software patch provided by the manufacturer. In general, much better accuracy was achieved in the transverse plane where images were acquired. Most distortion was found around the periphery while least distortion was present in the middle and most other parts of the phantom. For most intracranial lesions undergoing stereotactic radiosurgery, accuracy of target localization can be achieved within size of a voxel, especially with the Siemens scanner. However, extra caution should be taken for imaging of peripheral lesions where the distortion is the greatest.
