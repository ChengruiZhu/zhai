Five non-pregnant women, 6 healthy pregnant women at mid pregnancy and 8 healthy pregnant women at late pregnancy were enrolled in the study. In the group of non-pregnant women left ventricular (LV) cardiac output (CO) significantly decreased by 9% (p = 0.043) and right ventricular (RV) end-diastolic volume (EDV) significantly increased by 5% (p = 0.043) from the supine to the left lateral position. During mid pregnancy LV ejection fraction (EF), stroke volume (SV), left atrium lateral diameter and left atrial supero-inferior diameter increased significantly from the supine position to the left lateral position: 8%, 27%, 5% and 11%, respectively (p < 0.05). RV EDV, SV and right atrium supero-inferior diameter significantly increased from the supine to the left lateral position: 25%, 31% and 13% (p < 0.05), respectively. During late pregnancy a significant increment of LV EF, EDV, SV and CO was observed in the left lateral position: 11%, 21%, 35% and 24% (p < 0.05), respectively. Left atrial diameters were significantly larger in the left lateral position compared to the supine position (p < 0.05). RV CO was significantly increased in the left lateral position compared to the supine position (p < 0.05).
