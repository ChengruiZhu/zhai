. Single doses of from 0.5 to 5.0 gm. produced a peripheral sterilization of lymph glands and blood in an average of 6 to 12 hours. The duration of the peripheral sterilization following single doses of 17 to 83 mg. per kilo ranged from 17 to 58 days in patients who ultimately showed a return of trypanosomes to the peripheral blood. In a number of patients, however, treated with single doses of 9 to 68 mg. per kilo, no such relapse was detected during an observation period of from 40 to 111 days. The drug is extremely soluble in water and may be administered intramuscularly as well as intravenously. The immediate trypanocidal action after intramuscular administration was as rapid as that following the intravenous route while the duration of peripheral sterilization was appreciably longer. Relatively few repeated doses produced in advanced cases a marked and rapid diminution of the cells of the spinal fluid and were associated with definite improvement of mental and nervous symptoms. The occurrence of visual disturbances in certain advanced cases was the only untoward effect detected during the course of the work, and was apparently related to a too frequent administration of the drug. The condition was transitory in the majority of instances and resumption of treatment was not followed by a recurrence of this symptom. The general beneficial effect of the drug was a noticeable feature of its action in both early and advanced cases as shown by the disappearance of subjective symptoms, by the return of the pulse and temperature to normal limits, by the pronounced improvement of the blood picture, and by well marked gains in weight.
