Breast cancer is one of the most common causes of cancer related deaths in women. Currently, with the development of early detection, increased social awareness and kinds of treatment options, survival rate has improved in nearly every type of breast cancer patients. However, about one third patients still have increased chances of recurrence within five years and the five-year relative survival rate in patients with metastasis is less than 30%. Breast cancer contains multiple subtypes. Each subtype could cause distinct clinical outcomes and systemic interventions. Thereby, new targeted therapies are of particular importance to solve this major clinical problem. Aptamers, often termed “chemical antibodies”, are functionally similar to antibodies and have demonstrated their superiority of recognizing target with high selectivity, affinity and stability. With these intrinsic properties, aptamers have been widely studied in cancer biology and some are in clinical trials. In this review, we will firstly discuss about the global impacts and mechanisms of breast cancer, then briefly highlight applications of aptamers that have been developed for breast cancer and finally summarize various challenges in clinical translation of aptamers.
