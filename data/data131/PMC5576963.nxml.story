Systemic amyloidosis is a rare multisystem disease caused by incorrectly folded proteins that deposit pathologically in different tissues and organs of the human body. It has a very wide spectrum of clinical presentations according to the affected organ(s), and its diagnosis is commonly delayed. Cardiac involvement is the leading cause of morbidity and mortality and carries a poor prognosis, especially in primary light chain amyloidosis. Therefore any delay in the diagnosis can result in devastating outcomes for the patient. We report the case of a 65-year-old man who presented with dizziness and lightheadedness. He was found to have orthostatic hypotension and further investigations revealed the diagnosis of amyloid cardiomyopathy complicating a plasma cell dyscrasia. What is worth noting, in this case, is that the patient had cardiac amyloidosis presenting primarily as autonomic dysfunction and orthostatic hypotension, without any cardiac-specific symptoms such as heart failure or angina. This is a very unusual presentation of advanced-stage cardiac amyloidosis. This article highlights the variety of clinical presentations of cardiac amyloidosis, and focuses on the recent progress such as novel diagnostic and surveillance approaches using imaging, biomarkers, and new histological typing techniques. Current and future promising treatment options are also discussed, including methods directly targeting the amyloid deposits.
