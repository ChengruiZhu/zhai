Rewiring of interactions is a powerful tool for the evolution of organism complexity. Rewiring among preexisting proteins provides a simple mechanism for the development of new signaling circuits by redirecting information flows without a gain or loss of genes. Particularly, interactions mediated by short linear motifs can be easily changed by mutations during evolution, resulting in a rewiring of interactions. However, how interaction rewiring of linear motif interactions facilitates the emergence of new protein function during evolution is poorly understood. Here, we systematically investigated the rewiring of interactions mediated by PDZ domains, which are one of the most commonly found peptide recognition modules. We found that PDZ domain-ligand interactions are frequently rewired by C-terminal sequence mutations in PDZ ligands during evolution. Especially, rewiring of PDZ domain-ligand interactions was involved in neuronal function development, occurring concurrently with the emergence of vertebrates and suggesting that reorganization of signaling pathways by rewiring PDZ domain-ligand interactions significantly contributed to the evolution of nervous systems in vertebrates. Our findings highlight the rewiring of interactions as an effective means for functional innovation, providing new insight into eukaryotic evolution, which has not been fully explained by only the expansion of protein families.
