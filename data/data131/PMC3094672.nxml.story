Primary stabbing headache (PSH) is a pain, as brief, sharp, jabbing stabs, predominantly felt in the first division of trigeminal nerve. Population studies have shown that PSH is a common headache. However, most people suffer attacks of low frequency or intensity and seldom seek for medical assistance. There are few clinic-based studies of PSH, and its real influence as a primary cause for referral to neurology outpatient offices is to be determined. We aim to investigate the burden of PSH as main complaint in an outpatient headache clinic. We reviewed all patients with PSH (ICHD-II criteria), attended in an outpatient headache clinic in a tertiary hospital during a 2.5-year period (January 2008–June 2010). We considered demographic and nosological characteristics and if PSH was main cause of submission. 36 patients (26 females, 10 males) out of 725 (5%) were diagnosed of PSH. Mean age at onset 34.1 ± 2.9 years (range 10–72). Mean time from onset to diagnosis 68.8 ± 18.3 months. Twenty-four patients fulfilled ICHD-II criteria for other headaches (14 migraine, 6 tension-type headache, 2 hemicrania continua, 1 primary cough headache and 1 primary exertional headache). 77.7% of patients were submitted from primary care. In 14 patients (39%), PSH was main reason for submission, its intensity or frequency in 5 (35.7%) and fear of malignancy in 9 (74.3%). Only two patients of those who associated other headaches were submitted due to PSH. In conclusion, PSH is not an uncommon diagnosis in an outpatient headache office. However, and according to our data, it is not usually the main cause of submission to a headache clinic.
