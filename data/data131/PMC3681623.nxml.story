The molecular mechanisms mediating the pharmacologically induced state of general anesthesia are, in general, poorly understood. Modulation of voltage gated sodium channels is thought to play a major role in anesthesia, as several members of this class of channels show a significant response to general anesthetics. However, the detailed mechanism of inhibition or potentiation of these channels is completely unknown. Recently, the structures of several members of the bacterial family became available, thereby offering the opportunity to shed light on some of these issues. We have performed molecular dynamics simulations on one of these bacterial voltage gated sodium channels, NaChBac, to identify binding sites and access pathways for the volatile general anesthetic isoflurane. We found that isoflurane, at physiologically relevant concentrations, binds the channel at three distinct sites. One site is in the pore of the channel, suggesting that isoflurane may hinder the permeant sodium ions. Surprisingly, we found that this binding site is accessible to the drug even when the pore and the aqueous compartment at the intracellular side are disconnected. In our simulations, the “fenestrations” present in the membrane-embedded region of the channel act as the long-hypothesized hydrophobic drug access pathway.
