Most of our food comes from fruits and seeds, derived from a fertilized gynoecium. Therefore, understanding the mechanisms that control gynoecium development is of crucial importance. The Arabidopsis gynoecium has two fused carpels, with a medial domain between them, and a lateral domain consisting of the carpel walls. All the tissues that are involved in reproduction arise from the carpel margin meristem in the medial domain. The phytohormone cytokinin provides meristematic activity to cells, and interestingly, in a young gynoecium, the medial, but not the lateral, domain presents strong cytokinin signaling. One question that comes to mind is how this pattern is defined. This work demonstrates that the transcription factor SPATULA enables cytokinin signaling at the medial domain, while cytokinin signaling repressors are present in the lateral domain. A second question is whether and how cytokinin in the medial domain communicates with auxin, an important phytohormone for tissue differentiation. We found that cytokinin and SPT activate auxin biosynthesis and transport genes. The integration of these findings gives the first gene regulatory network acting during early gynoecium development. This network is most likely conserved in flowering plants, and can provide insights of molecular processes that are key for food production.
