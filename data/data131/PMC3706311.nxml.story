Studies on cultured muscle cells have shown that treatment with resveratrol, a chemical famously found in the skin of red grapes, stimulates the manufacture of new mitochondria. This has been attributed to the activation of the deacetylase SIRT1 either directly by resveratrol or indirectly via the activation of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK). SIRT1 is then thought to deacetylate and activate the transcriptional coactivator PGC-1α, which in turn stimulates mitochondrial biogenesis. It has also been reported that feeding resveratrol to mice increases muscle mitochondria and results in improved running endurance. Here we further analyze the adaptive response of muscle mitochondria to resveratrol treatment to see if it mimics the response to endurance exercise. We find that feeding rats or mice large amounts of resveratrol did not increase muscle mitochondria. In these rodents, the bioavailability of oral resveratrol is low, and the resulting plasma level of resveratrol is far below the concentration required to activate AMPK. Contrary to previous reports we find that deacetylation by SIRT1 decreases PGC-1α activity and results in a decrease in mitochondria; moreover we show that the increase in mitochondria induced in cultured muscle cells by a high resveratrol concentration is due to the toxic activation of AMPK and, in turn, PGC-1α. However, this effect requires resveratrol concentrations that are very much higher than those attained by oral administration, and we conclude that oral resveratrol has no effect on mitochondrial biogenesis in skeletal muscle.
