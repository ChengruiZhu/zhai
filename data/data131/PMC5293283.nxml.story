Interactions between proteins are at the basis of all biological processes in the cell. In this context, the study of conformational responses of protein receptors to the binding of endogenous ligands may be a source of inspiration for the design of small molecule modulators that permit to control such biological processes. To progress towards this goal, we need to unravel the molecular determinants that underlie the correlations between sequences, structures and the onset of functional motions in the receptor, eventually illuminating the links between the fine atomic-scale protein-ligand interactions and the large-scale protein motions. Herein, we have concentrated on the multidomain receptor αvβ3 integrin bound to two different sequences of the endogenous ligand fibronectin: the wild type one, wtFN10, which acts as an agonist activating the receptor, and a high affinity mutant, hFN10, which acts as a true antagonist inhibiting the receptor. Through the comparative analysis of several dynamic descriptors at different levels of resolution, from the residue to domain level, we shed light on the salient conformational dynamics differences determined by fibronectin sequence mutations: we show that it is possible to identify interaction hotspots in the integrin binding site that specifically respond to the fibronectin sequence variations, and allosterically drive conformational changes towards integrin activation (in the case of wtFN10 binding) or inhibition (hFN10 binding). Finally we propose an allosteric model of integrin regulation that can be used in the design of small molecule integrin inhibitors or modulators.
