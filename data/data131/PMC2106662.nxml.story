 The appearance and distribution of electron-opaque, lipid-containing bodies have been studied in liver of adult male mice of the C3H strain. The mice were either partially hepatectomized or sham-operated, and the liver was fixed in Veronal acetate-buffered 2 per cent osmium tetroxide at various postoperative intervals (10, 20, 40, 60, and 120 minutes). Normal, non-operated mice served as controls. As early as 10 minutes after both sham operation and partial hepatectomy, lipid-containing bodies have been observed, not only in the cytoplasm of hepatic parenchymal cells, but also in the space of Disse. At the very early postoperative intervals studied, minute lipid bodies are repeatedly found to be more numerous in the space of Disse than at later intervals. It is suggested that the lipid-containing bodies enter the parenchymal cell from the circulation. At the cell membrane, numerous invaginations, each containing a lipid body, have been observed; this suggests that the lipid bodies enter the hepatic parenchymal cells by the process of pinocytosis.The fact that only hepatic parenchymal cells contain the lipid bodies, whereas von Kupffer, endothelial lining, and Ito's fat-storing cells do not, may indicate a specific lipid mobilization response on the part of the cells of the hepatic parenchyma.
