, the biological functions of miR-505 were examined by wound healing, MTT and Transwell assays and western blot analysis in MG63 cells transfected with miRNA mimics or empty vector. Luciferase assay was utilized to assess whether HMGB1 is a target of miR-505. miRNA microarrays revealed 26 aberrant miRNAs in osteosarcoma tissues; miR-505 showed the most pronounced decrease (P<0.01), which was significantly associated with TNM stage and metastasis status (P<0.05). In addition, HMGB1 was highly expressed in osteosarcoma tissues (P<0.01), with a significantly negative correlation with miR-505 (r=−0.6679, P<0.001). Furthermore, miR-505 inhibited proliferation, migration and invasion abilities of MG63 cells (P<0.01). Moreover, luciferase activity of the HMGB1-3′-UTR plasmid was suppressed following miR-505 binding (P<0.01). Finally, HMGB1 overexpression partly reversed the effects of miR-505 on MG63 cells. In conclusion, miR-505 levels are decreased in osteosarcoma tissues, and reduced miR-505 expression is significantly associated with poorer clinical prognosis in patients with osteosarcomas. miR-505 inhibits osteosarcoma cell proliferation, migration and invasion by regulating HMGB1.
