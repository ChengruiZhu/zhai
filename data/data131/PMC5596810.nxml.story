Neonatal diabetes, defined as the onset of diabetes within the first six months of life, is very rarely caused by pancreatic agenesis. Homozygous truncating mutations in the PTF1A gene, which encodes a transcriptional factor, have been reported in patients with pancreatic and cerebellar agenesis, whilst mutations located in a distal pancreatic-specific enhancer cause isolated pancreatic agenesis. We report an infant, born to healthy non-consanguineous parents, with neonatal diabetes due to pancreatic agenesis. Initial genetic investigation included sequencing of KCNJ11, ABCC8 and INS genes, but no mutations were found. Following this, 22 neonatal diabetes associated genes were analyzed by a next generation sequencing assay. We found compound heterozygous mutations in the PTF1A gene: A frameshift mutation in exon 1 (c.437_462 del, p.Ala146Glyfs*116) and a mutation affecting a highly conserved nucleotide within the distal pancreatic enhancer (g.23508442A>G). Both mutations were confirmed by Sanger sequencing. Isolated pancreatic agenesis resulting from compound heterozygosity for truncating and enhancer mutations in the PTF1A gene has not been previously reported. This report broadens the spectrum of mutations causing pancreatic agenesis.
