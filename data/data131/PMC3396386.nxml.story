Chitosan was selected for the nanobubble shell because of its low toxicity, low immunogenicity, and excellent biocompatibility, while the core consisted of perfluoropentane. DNA-loaded chitosan nanobubbles were formed with a mean diameter of less than 300 nm and a positive surface charge. Transmission electron microscopic analysis confirmed composition of the core-shell structure. The ability of the chitosan nanobubbles to complex with and protect DNA was confirmed by agarose gel assay. Chitosan nanobubbles were found to be stable following insonation (2.5 MHz) for up to 3 minutes at 37Â°C. DNA release was evaluated in vitro in both the presence and absence of ultrasound. The release of chitosan nanobubble-bound plasmid DNA occurred after just one minute of insonation. In vitro transfection experiments were performed by exposing adherent COS7 cells to ultrasound in the presence of different concentrations of plasmid DNA-loaded nanobubbles. In the absence of ultrasound, nanobubbles failed to trigger transfection at all concentrations tested. In contrast, 30 seconds of ultrasound promoted a moderate degree of transfection. Cell viability experiments demonstrated that neither ultrasound nor the nanobubbles affected cell viability under these experimental conditions.
