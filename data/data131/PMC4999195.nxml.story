It has been suggested that one key factor driving the emergence of drug resistance is the spatial heterogeneity in the distribution of drug and oxygen throughout a tumor due to disorganized tumor vasculatures. Researchers have developed a class of novel drugs that penetrate to hypoxic regions where they are activated to kill tumor cells. The inclusion of these drugs, called hypoxia-activated prodrugs (HAPs) alongside standard therapies in combination may be the key to long-term tumor control or eradication. However, identifying the right timing and administration sequence of combination therapies is an extremely difficult task, and the time and human costs of clinical trials to investigate even a few options is often prohibitive. In this work we design a mathematical model based upon evolutionary principles to investigate the potential of combining HAPs with standard targeted therapy for a specific example in non-small cell lung cancer. We formulate novel toxicity constraints from existing clinical data to estimate the shape of the tolerated drug combination treatment space. We find that (i) combining these therapies delays resistance longer than any monotherapy schedule with either evofosfamide or erlotinib alone, and (ii) the best strategy for combination involves single doses of each drug sequentially administered in an alternating sequence. These model predictions of tumor dynamics during treatment provide insight into the role of the tumor microenvironment in combination therapy and identify treatment hypotheses for further experimental and clinical testing.
