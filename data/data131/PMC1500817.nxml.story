Why do some proteins evolve so very slowly? Why are only a few proteins uniquely vital to the functioning of an organism? Understanding how proteins interact with other proteins may provide the answers. Some proteins are, it is suggested, like hubs on a wheel with multiple spokes (interacting partners) attached: take away a spoke and the wheel works, take away the hub and the wheel is useless. With so many proteins to bind with, hubs may also be as slow evolving as some interaction sites are constrained in their evolution. Unfortunately, prior analyses have been equivocal, not least because of an uncertainty about which proteins interact with which others. Here the authors employ an extensive literature-curated dataset of reliable proteinâ€“protein interactions to address the issue of essentiality, connectivity, and evolutionary rate. This study finds that hubs are more likely to be essential, and if not essential, at least have a larger impact on fitness. However, hub proteins are not slow evolving, in part, because hubs do not have a higher density of binding sites. Hub proteins do, however, appear to be under strong regulation, an adaptation the authors suggest that minimizes the risk of unwanted activation.
