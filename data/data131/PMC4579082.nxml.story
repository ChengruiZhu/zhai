Animals interrogate the world around them with actively moving sensory organs, resulting in a blend of sensory inputs: one input is from the object under study, while the second is from self-generated movement of the sensor. The detection of an object thus depends on the ability of the animal to distinguish among internally versus externally generated sensations. Nervous systems employ various signaling mechanisms to reference inputs from a sensory organ relative to its position. A well-known example is proprioception, in which receptors in the limb muscles and joints are used to infer the position of tactile sensors in the hands. In this case, the signals of limb position are encoded in areas of the brain that are distinct from those encoding touch. Here, we investigate the analogous problem of encoding the position of the vibrissae, or whiskersâ€”essential orofacial sensorimotor organs in rodents. In contrast to the case for limbs, we find that vibrissa position is encoded along the same neuroanatomical pathway as vibrissa touch. The seeming ambiguity that results from the mixed representation of position and touch can be resolved by a nonlinear neuronal input-output relation that demodulates touch with respect to vibrissa position. This scheme enables the rodent to determine where an object is located relative to its body axis.
