 Sheep injected every 2 weeks with heterologous GBM and Freund's adjuvant by any one or combination of the following routes: intramuscular, subcutaneous, or intradermal, develop uniformly a fulminating, extracapillary glomerulonephritis, invariably fatal within 27 to 90 days after the first injection. The chief histologic feature is marked fibroepithelial proliferation of Bowman's capsule with crescent formation. The appearance of the lesions resembles the acute, subacute, and chronic stages of human glomerulonephritis, and depends on when the animal was sacrificed. Freund's adjuvant or heterologous GBM alone does not produce such a nephritis. The combination of placental tissue and Freund's adjuvant under the present experimental conditions was also unable to produce a nephritis. The clinical course, increase in nitrogen retention, evolution of renal lesions, and death, all describe a fulminating disease. The disease most characteristically resembles fatal, fulminating human subacute glomerulonephritis. The changes in serum proteins, decrease in serum albumin, and increase in serum globulin, occurred approximately the same in both the GBM-treated and the control adjuvant group. Similar changes have been reported from hyperimmunization alone, and so it is not clear how much these changes are due to immunization and how much is due to the nephritic process. The changes in serum cholesterol were not considered statistically significant. Circulating serum antibodies which localized (by fluorescent antibody technique
