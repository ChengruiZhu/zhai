Until recently, the assessment of organ and tissue health relied on site-sampling (biopsy) of micro-scale regions and was fraught with sampling errors. Overcoming these limitations requires a means for seamless imaging of organs, from their cellular inhabitants to whole organs, akin to charting a map of the organ and its resident cells. Map navigation necessitates the capacity to zoom in and out of regions of interest, with high precision, as well as to analyze relationships between cells, tissue degeneration and organ (patho-)physiology. Here we describe the process, in technical detail, based on a world-first case study of a human hip sample and its resident cell population. We acquired 55,000 nm-resolution images of the hip using multi-beam scanning electron microscopy (mSEM). To reconstruct the entire dataset, we developed stitching algorithms to maximize map precision at smallest length scales, and rendered them using the Google Maps API. This enabled the exploration of the hip and its inhabitants in a seamless manner, from a global to a high-resolution local view of a single cell. The resulting navigable maps are available for research teams and the public alike to explore and to elucidate the cellular basis of tissue degeneration and organ failure (mechbio.org).
