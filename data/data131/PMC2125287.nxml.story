 1. The transforming power of red blood cells for atoxyl is apparently uninfluenced by a preliminary heating of the blood for 30 minutes at 50° C., but a temperature of 55° C. acting for 30 minutes destroys this property of blood almost completely. 2. When the heating was for 60 minutes, 54° C. and higher temperatures apparently destroyed all the transforming power. 3. After heating for 10 minutes, 70° C. destroyed almost all the transforming power, and 100° C. seemingly destroyed all. 4. Under the influence of certain temperatures blood seemingly binds transformed atoxyl, and under the influence of other temperatures frees it again. A temperature of 70° C. for 10 minutes applied to blood subsequent to its incubation with atoxyl causes nearly all the toxicity of the solution to disappear. On the other hand, a temperature of 100° C. for 10 minutes applied to blood subsequent to incubation with atoxyl leaves the solution almost as toxic as if the blood had not been heated at all after the incubation. 5. Some of the transformed atoxyl bound by blood when it is heated to 70° C. for 10 minutes is freed if the heating at 70° C. is prolonged to 30 minutes. See PDF for Structure 6. Blood which has bound transformed atoxyl gives up most, but not all, of this toxic substance when heated to 100° for 10 minutes. All, or nearly all, is freed when the heating at 100° C. is continued for 30 minutes. 7. Under the influence of 70° C. for io minutes transformed atoxyl may be made to enter blood corpuscles, for the fluid above these corpuscles is rendered non-toxic and does not become toxic again when heated to 100° for 20 minutes, provided it contains no laked blood. The blood corpuscles, on the other hand, when heated to 100° for 20 minutes in contact with fresh salt solution, make this solution quite toxic. 8. Laked blood in contact with transformed atoxyl behaves like unlaked blood when heated to 70° C. and to 100° C. for 10 to 30 minutes. 9. The toxic substance can be concentrated by heating the blood corpuscles in contact with transformed atoxyl to 70° C. for 10 minutes, centrifugalizing, removing a large part of the supernatant fluid, and then heating to 100° C. for 30 minutes. 10. The power of blood to take up and bind transformed atoxyl is destroyed apparently completely by heating blood to 100° C. for 10 minutes. 11. The toxic substance into which atoxyl is transformed (transformed atoxyl) is thermostabile, but the transforming agent in blood is thermolabile.
