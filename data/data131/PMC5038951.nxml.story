Cancer proliferating cells adapt their metabolism to support the conversion of available nutrients into biomass, which often involves an increased rate of specific metabolic pathways, such as glycolysis. Surprisingly, however, we observe that aggregating individual gene expression using canonical human metabolic pathways frequently fails to enhance the classification of noncancerous vs. cancerous tissues and in the task of predicting cancer patient survival. This supports the notion that metabolic alterations in cancer rewire cellular metabolism through unconventional pathways. Here we introduce a novel algorithm (MCF) that aims to identify these cancer-mediated ‘composite’ metabolic pathways by identifying those that best differentiate between cancerous vs. non-cancerous tissues gene expression. Remarkably, MCF successfully builds robust classifiers integrating different datasets of the same cancer type. We further show that the data-driven pathways identified by MCF, in contrast to the canonical literature-based pathways, successfully generate clinically relevant features that are predictive of breast cancer patients’ survival in an independent dataset. Our findings thus suggest that cancer metabolism may be rewired via non-standard composite pathways.
