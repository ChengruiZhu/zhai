Mean nuclear area has been consistently shown by different researchers to be a strong and independent prognostic factor in advanced ovarian carcinoma. However, the biological background of the prognostic value of nuclear area remains unclear. Others have found that the multidrug‐resistance (MDR) related protein LRP has strong prognostic value. In the present study we have analysed whether the mean nuclear area and LRP are related in tumour tissue of the ovary obtained at the debulking operation before the administration of chemotherapy in 40 patients. The mitotic activity index, volume percentage epithelium, standard deviation of nuclear area and the other MDR‐related proteins P‐glycoprotein (JSB‐1, MRK‐16) and MRP have been investigated additionally for correlations and prognostic value. No correlations were found between the morphometrical features and MDR‐related proteins. Mean nuclear area tended to be larger in LRP positive tumours, but the correlation was not significant. In multivariate analysis LRP‐protein expression and mean nuclear area had independent prognostic value. Further studies are required to elucidate the biological background of the strong prognostic value of mean nuclear area in advanced ovarian cancer.
