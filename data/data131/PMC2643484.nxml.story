The ability of HIV to rapidly acquire mutations responsible for resistance to administered drugs underlies the failure of current antiretroviral therapies for HIV infection. The recent advent of drugs that offer large genetic barriers to resistance, e.g., tipranavir and darunavir, presents a new opportunity to devise therapies that remain efficacious over extended durations. The large number of mutations that HIV must accumulate for resistance to drugs with large genetic barriers impedes the failure of therapy. Further, these drugs appear to exhibit activity against viral strains resistant to other drugs in the same drug class, thereby significantly improving options for therapy. Rational identification of treatment protocols that maximize the impact of these new drugs requires a quantitative understanding of the process whereby HIV overcomes large genetic barriers to resistance. We develop a model that describes HIV dynamics under the influence of a drug that offers a large genetic barrier to resistance and predict the time of emergence of viral strains that overcome the large barrier. Model predictions provide insights into the roles of various evolutionary forces underlying the development of resistance, quantitatively describe the development of resistance to tipranavir
