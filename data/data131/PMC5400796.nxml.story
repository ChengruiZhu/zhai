The development of autoimmunity and/or autoimmune diseases is multifactorial. Vitamin D is one of the factors that might play a role. We postulated that both the presence of adjuvants and insufficient levels of vitamin D may result in the development of autoimmunity in patients with autoimmune/inflammatory syndrome induced by adjuvants (ASIA) in relation to silicone implant incompatibility. We measured vitamin D levels in 135 patients with ASIA in relation to silicone implant incompatibility and related findings to the presence of autoantibodies that are commonly used to diagnose systemic autoimmune diseases. Furthermore, we systematically reviewed the literature regarding vitamin D deficiency as a risk factor for the development of autoantibodies. Vitamin D measurements were available for analysis in 131 of 135 patients with ASIA in relation to SIIS. Twenty-three patients (18%) tested positive for autoantibodies, from which 18 patients (78%) had either a vitamin D deficiency or insufficiency (median vitamin D level 60.5 mmol/L), whereas five patients (22%) had sufficient vitamin D levels. The risk to develop autoantibodies was significantly increased in vitamin D deficient and/or insufficient patients [RR 3.14; 95% CI, 1.24–7.95;
