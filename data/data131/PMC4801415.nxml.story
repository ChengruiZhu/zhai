The complex morphologies of neurons present challenges for analysis. Large data sets can be gathered, but extracting meaningful data from the hundreds of branches from one axon over a few hundred time points can be difficult. One problem in particular is matching a single unique branch through several images, when the branches can extend, retract, or be removed entirely. In addition, if the imaging is done in vivo, the environment itself can grow and shift. Here we introduce Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) analysis to follow the complex structures of neurons through time. DTW identifies individual branches and therefore allows the determination of branch lifetimes. Using this approach we find that for retinal ganglion cell axons, the branch birth rate increases over time as axons navigate to their targets, and that blocking neural activity slightly increases the branch death rate without impacting the birth rate. From the estimated birth and death rate parameters we create simulations based on a continuous-time Markov chain process. These tools expand the techniques available to study the development of neuronal structures and provide more information from large time-lapse imaging datasets.
