Cellular capability to mutate its DNA plays an important role in evolution and impinges on medical issues, including acquisition of mutator phenotypes by cancer cells and emergence of drug-resistant pathogens. Whether and how the environment affects rates of mutation has been studied predominantly in the context of environmental agents that damage DNA (e.g. UV and Î³-rays). However, it has been observed that conditions of chronic non-DNA-damaging stress (e.g. starvation or heat shock) also increase mutagenesis. It has been shown that in bacteria, activation of the general stress response activates a pro-mutagenic pathway and thus promotes mutagenesis during periods of stress. However, in eukaryotes, so far there has been no evidence of a stress response regulating mutagenesis. In this manuscript we demonstrate that in budding yeast, a model eukaryote, the general environmental stress response (ESR) regulates mutagenesis induced by proteotoxic stress (accumulation of unfolded proteins) at several loci. We also identify two pro-mutagenic DNA metabolic pathways that contribute to this mutagenesis and present genetic data showing that the ESR regulates these pathways. Together, these data advance our understanding of how cellular sensing and responding to environmental cues affect cellular capability for mutagenesis.
