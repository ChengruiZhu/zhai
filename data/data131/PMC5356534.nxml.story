Published data on the association between 8q24 polymorphism and breast cancer (BC) risk are inconclusive. Thus, we conducted a meta-analysis to evaluate the relationship between 8q24 (rs13281615 and rs6983267) polymorphism and BC risk. We searched PubMed, EMBASE, Web of Science and the Cochrane Library up to August 13, 2015 for relevant studies. Odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were used to estimate the strength of associations. Twenty-six studies published from 2008 to 2014, with a total of 52,683 cases and 64,672 controls, were included in this meta-analysis. The pooled results showed that there was significant association between 8q24 rs13281615 polymorphism and BC risk in any genetic model. In the subgroup analysis by ethnicity, the effects remained in Asians and Caucasians. However, no genetic models reached statistical association in Africans. There was no association in any genetic model in rs6983267. This meta-analysis suggests that 8q24 rs13281615 polymorphism is a risk factor for susceptibility to BC in Asians, Caucasians and in overall population, While, there was no association in Africans. The rs6983267 polymorphism has no association with BC risk in any genetic model. Further large scale multicenter epidemiological studies are warranted to confirm this finding.
