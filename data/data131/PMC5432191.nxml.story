In addition to gene expression and translation control, post-translational modifications (PTMs) represent another level to regulate proteins functions. Different PTM sites within a protein usually co-operate to fulfill their functional roles. Recent advances in high-throughput mass spectrometry (MS) technologies have facilitated the proteome-wide identification of PTM sites, giving rise to both challenge and opportunity to understand their functional relationships. Previously, several data mining approaches have been developed to explore the global PTM interplays. In this study, we proposed to infer functional associations between PTM sites from the correlation of their modification status across many biological conditions, which was not exploited before. In practice, we tested if a pair of sites are modified together under the same condition significantly more often than expected (co-occurrence). As a proof of principle, we applied this analytical strategy to human phosphorylation because we could collect data sets of proteome-wide coverage under 88 different conditions. We demonstrated that sites with co-occurring phosphorylation status are functionally associated from several lines of evidence. The co-occurrence analysis can also uncover functionally connected phosphosites with clear biological evidence which are missed by other approaches. With increasing proteome-wide data for other types of PTMs under different conditions, the co-occurrence analysis can be integrated with other methods to identify novel PTM associations.
