Cheliensisine A (Chel A) as a novel styryl-lactone isolated from Goniothalamus cheliensis Hu has been indicated to be a chemotherapeutic agent in Leukemia HL-60 cells. However, its potential for cancer treatment and the underlying mechanisms are not deeply investigated to the best of our knowledge. Current studies showed that Chel A could trigger p53-mediated apoptosis, accompanied with dramatically inhibition of anchorage-independent growth of human colon cancer HCT116 cells. Further studies found that Chel A treatment resulted in p53 protein stabilization and accumulation via the induction of its phosphorylation at Ser20 and Ser15. Moreover, Chel A-induced p53 protein accumulation and activation required ATR/Chk2 axis, which is distinct from the mechanism that we have most recently identified the Chk1/p53-dependent apoptotic response by Chel A in normal mouse epidermal Cl41 cells. In addition, our results demonstrated that hydrogen peroxide generation induced by Chel A acted as a precursor for all these signaling events and downstream biological effects. Taken together, we have identified the Chel A as a new therapeutic agent, which highlights its potential for cancer therapeutic effect.
