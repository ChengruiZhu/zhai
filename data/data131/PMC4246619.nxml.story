At present, scientists have performed numerous studies investigating the morbidity of renal cell carcinoma (RCC) in the genetic and microRNA (miRNA) fields, obtaining a substantial amount of knowledge. However, the experimentally validated data of genes, miRNA and transcription factors (TFs) cannot be found in a unified form, which makes it challenging to decipher the regulatory mechanisms. In the present study, the genes, miRNAs and TFs involved in RCC are regarded as elements in the regulatory network, and the present study therefore focuses on the association between each entity. Three regulatory networks were constructed hierarchically to indicate the regulatory association between the genes, miRNAs and TFs clearly, including the differentially expressed, associated and global networks. All the elements were macroscopically investigated in these networks, instead of only investigating one or several of them. The present study not only compared and analyzed the similarities and the differences between the three networks, but also systematically expounded the pathogenesis of RCC and supplied theoretical foundations for future gene therapy investigations. Following the construction of the three networks, certain important pathways were highlighted. The upstream and downstream element table of differentially expressed genes and miRNAs was listed, in which self-adaption associations and circle-regulations were identified. In future studies, the identified genes and miRNAs should be granted more attention.
