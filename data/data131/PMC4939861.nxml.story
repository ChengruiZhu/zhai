This cross-sectional study was conducted to examine tooth loss and associated factors among professional drivers and white-collar workers. The participants were recruited by applying screening procedures to a pool of Japanese registrants in an online database. The participants were asked to complete a self-reported questionnaire. A total of 592 professional drivers and 328 white-collar workers (male, aged 30 to 69 years) were analyzed. A multiple logistic regression analysis was performed to identify differences between professional drivers and white-collar workers. The results showed that professional drivers had fewer teeth than white-collar workers (odds ratio [OR], 1.74; 95% confidence interval [95% CI], 1.150–2.625). Moreover, a second multiple logistic regression analysis revealed that several factors were associated with the number of teeth among professional drivers: diabetes mellitus (OR, 2.68; 95% CI, 1.388–5.173), duration of brushing teeth (OR, 1.66; 95% CI, 1.066–2.572), frequency of eating breakfast (OR, 2.23; 95% CI, 1.416–3.513), frequency of eating out (OR, 1.70; 95% CI, 1.086–2.671) and smoking status (OR, 2.88; 95% CI, 1.388–5.964). These findings suggest that the lifestyles of professional drivers could be related to not only their general health status, but also tooth loss.
