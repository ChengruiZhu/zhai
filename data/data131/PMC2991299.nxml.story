We studied 35 controls and 18 patients with severe aortic valve stenosis and preserved LV ejection fraction who had PC-CMR and Doppler echocardiography exams on the same day. PC-CMR mitral flow and myocardial velocity data were analyzed using custom software for semi-automated extraction of diastolic parameters. Inter-operator reproducibility of flow pattern segmentation and functional parameters was assessed on a sub-group of 30 subjects. The mean percentage of overlap between the transmitral flow segmentations performed by two independent operators was 99.7 ± 1.6%, resulting in a small variability (<1.96 ± 2.95%) in functional parameter measurement. For maximal myocardial longitudinal velocities, the inter-operator variability was 4.25 ± 5.89%. The MR diastolic parameters varied significantly in patients as opposed to controls (p < 0.0002). Both velocity and flow rate diastolic parameters were consistent with echocardiographic values (r > 0.71) and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis revealed their ability to separate patients from controls, with sensitivity > 0.80, specificity > 0.80 and accuracy > 0.85. Slight superiority in terms of correlation with echocardiography (r = 0.81) and accuracy to detect LV abnormalities (sensitivity > 0.83, specificity > 0.91 and accuracy > 0.89) was found for the PC-CMR flow-rate related parameters.
