Silkworm pathogens have been heavily impeding the development of sericultural industry and play important roles in lepidopteran ecology, and some of which are used as biological insecticides. Rapid advances in studies on the omics of silkworm pathogens have produced a large amount of data, which need to be brought together centrally in a coherent and systematic manner. This will facilitate the reuse of these data for further analysis. We have collected genomic data for 86 silkworm pathogens from 4 taxa (fungi, microsporidia, bacteria and viruses) and from 4 lepidopteran hosts, and developed the open-access Silkworm Pathogen Database (SilkPathDB) to make this information readily available. The implementation of SilkPathDB involves integrating Drupal and GBrowse as a graphic interface for a Chado relational database which houses all of the datasets involved. The genomes have been assembled and annotated for comparative purposes and allow the search and analysis of homologous sequences, transposable elements, protein subcellular locations, including secreted proteins, and gene ontology. We believe that the SilkPathDB will aid researchers in the identification of silkworm parasites, understanding the mechanisms of silkworm infections, and the developmental ecology of silkworm parasites (gene expression) and their hosts.
