Ang-1, Ang-2 and Ang-3 were detected in mammary tissues. Ang-1 was seen in both normal epithelial cells, breast cancer cells as well as in endothelial cells. Ang-2 was seen at a higher level than Ang-1 and it is expressed in epithelial, endothelial as well as stromal cells to certain degree. Ang-1 and Ang-2 transcripts were detected almost equally in cancer and normal breast tissue, and Ang-3 was high in cancer tissue compared to normal breast but not significant (155 ± 123 & 24.1 ± 22.6, P > 0.05). No significant differences were seen between patients with different predicted prognosis (using the Nottingham Prognostic Index as a guide) (Ang-1 p = 0.34, Ang-2 p = 0.26 and Ang-3 p = 0.32, respectively). No significant correlation was seen between Ang-1, Ang-2 and Ang-3 with tumour grade. When the levels of the transcripts were compared against clinical outcome (disease free, developed recurrence and patients who died of breast cancer), levels of Ang-3 transcript was found to be high in breast cancer patient who had bone metastasis 33.8 ± 28.3, although the difference was not significant (p = 0.08). No significant difference was seen with levels of Ang-1 and Ang-2 transcripts and clinical outcomes. Furthermore, no significant trend was observed between Tie-2 receptor and clinical/pathological parameters in the cohort.
