 SLiM evolution – the evolution of a novel SLiM from “nothing” – adding a functional module to a previously non-functional region of protein sequence. In our model, hundreds of motif-binding domains in higher eukaryotic proteins connect simple motif specificities with useful functions to create a large functional motif space. Accessible peptides that match the specificity of these motif-binding domains are continuously created and destroyed by mutations in rapidly evolving disordered regions, creating a dynamic supply of new interactions that may have advantageous phenotypic novelty. This provides a reservoir of diversity to modify existing interaction networks. Evolutionary pressures will act on these motifs to retain beneficial instances. However, most will be lost on an evolutionary timescale as negative selection and genetic drift act on deleterious and neutral motifs respectively. In light of the parallels between the presented model and the evolution of motifs in the regulatory segments of genes and (pre-)mRNAs, we suggest our understanding of regulatory networks would benefit from the creation of a shared model describing the evolution of transcriptional, post-transcriptional and post-translational regulation.
