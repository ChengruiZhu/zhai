The objectives of this study were to identify signs of vestibular nerve suffering through a bedside vestibular examination protocol in case of sudden sensorineural unilateral hearing loss without spontaneous signs of vestibular impairment and to propose a bed-side vestibular examination based protocol for the focused execution of gadolinium-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) only if a vestibular schwannoma is suspected. 96 patients, 52 men, 44 women, mean age 57.73 +/- 12.85 years, suffering from sudden sensorineural unilateral hearing loss, which presented neither vertigo nor spontaneous nystagmus, were enrolled. Pure tone audiometry, tympanometry, measurement of acoustic reflexes and Anderson test to detect adaptation, bedside vestibular examination through head shaking test, vibration test, head impulse test, hyperventilation test and detection of nystagmus in supine and lateral decubitus to search for signs of vestibular impairment were performed. Patients with signs of vestibular impairment and pure tone audiometry threshold at high frequencies better than 70 dB nHL were subjected to auditory brainstem responses. Gadolinium enhanced MRI centred on internal acoustic canals was carried out in all patients with sudden sensorineural unilateral hearing loss. Main outcome measures were signs of vestibular impairment at vestibular bedside examination and presence of vestibular schwannoma on MRI. Signs of vestibular impairment were detected in 22/96 cases (22.9%); a vestibular schwannoma was detected by MRI in 5/96 cases (5.2%), always when vestibular impairment was present. In case of sudden sensorineural unilateral hearing loss, vestibular bedside examination seems to be useful to restrict the suspicion of a vestibular schwannoma to cases with signs of vestibular impairment, reducing the number of MRI exams, with considerable economic savings.
