Vitamin D has been recognized as a potent immunomodulator and its deficiency is common in different population groups including patients with SLE. As miRNAs regulation plays a significant role in SLE, the present study aimed to evaluate the association between vitamin D status and miRNAs levels in patients with SLE. The serum concentrations of vitamin D (25-hydroxyvitamin D) and the levels of six miRNAs in T cells from patients with SLE were measured in 42 SLE cases and 48 healthy controls. Vitamin D treatment was also performed in isolated and cultured T cells from SLE patients in different times and doses. Vitamin D insufficiency (25-hydroxyvitamin D concentration <20 ng/ml) was more common in cases than in controls. Although age and BMI were similar, cases had significantly lower concentrations of miRNA-377, miRNA-342, miRNA-10a, miRNA-374b, miRNA-125a, and miRNA-410 than controls. Furthermore, a significant positive correlation was also observed between 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentrations and measured miRNAs levels. A significant difference in observed miRNAs levels was also observed in patients with 25-hydroxyvitamin D insufficiency compared with patients with 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentration ≥20 ng/ml.
