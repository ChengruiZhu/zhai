Of the thirty-three injuries identified, twenty (60.6%) were primarily ligamentous. Only one patient had evidence of lateral column instability. Average patient age was twenty-eight. Eleven injuries (33%) were initially missed, delaying diagnosis an average of thirty-four days. Primary arthrodesis was performed in fifteen patients; most were secondary to subacute or chronic presentation. ORIF was performed on the remaining eighteen patients. All fixation constructs included solid screws, dorsal plates, or a combination of both. Minor complications occurred in twelve patients and included sensory changes, superficial infection treated with antibiotics, and symptomatic hardware. Complications requiring surgery other than hardware removal were seen in two patients including one ORIF patient who underwent secondary arthrodesis. VAS pain at final evaluation averaged 1.6. Thirty-one of thirty-three (93.9%) were able to return to full military activity. There were no significant differences in demographic data, injury patterns, complication rates, VAS pain score, and return to full activity. Hardware removal was performed in thirteen ORIF and two arthrodesis patients (p<0.005). The arthrodesis group returned to full activity at an average of 4.7 months while the ORIF returned at an average of 6.7 months (P<0.05).
