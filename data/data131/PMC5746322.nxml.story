Substantial evidence has indicated that Notch and bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) signaling may regulate odontoblastic differentiation. Hairy/enhancer-of-split related with YRPW motif 1 (Hey1), a downstream target gene of Notch and BMP signaling, is expressed in dental pulp tissues and has been demonstrated to be responsible for osteoblast mineralization. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of Hey1 on odontoblast differentiation. The results of the study demonstrated that Hey1 expression in odontoblast-lineage cells (OLCs) was upregulated by stimulation of osteoblastic/odontoblastic differentiation medium containing ascorbic acid, Î²-glycerol phosphate and dexamethasone. Furthermore, stable Hey1-overexpressing cells expressed higher levels of dentin sialophosphoprotein (DSPP) and exhibited higher mineralization capabilities following stimulation by differentiation medium. Furthermore, RNA interference-mediated knockdown of Hey1 downregulated the expression levels of DSPP in OLCs stimulated by differentiation medium. Taken together, the findings indicate that Hey1 may be a positive regulator of odontoblastic differentiation. The present study broadens the understanding of odontoblast differentiation and biomineralization.
