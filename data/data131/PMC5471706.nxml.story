Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) is one of the most common metabolic complications of pregnancy. Ever since the first systematic evaluation of the oral glucose tolerance test by Oâ€™Sullivan and colleagues was carried out in 1964, there has been controversy with respect to the optimal screening and diagnostic criteria to detect GDM. The recently proposed International Association of Diabetes and Pregnancy Study Groups (IADPSG) criteria for GDM has found fairly widespread acceptance, but it is still debated by several societies. This review intends to provide an overview of the evolution of the screening and diagnostic criteria for GDM. Debatable issues regarding optimal screening strategies, especially in the low resource settings of low and middle income countries are highlighted. The recent Women in India with GDM Strategy (WINGS) project carried out in Chennai, India tried to develop a Model of Care for GDM suitable for resource constrained settings. The findings related to screening and diagnosis of GDM based on WINGS are also highlighted in this review. Based on the WINGS experience we believe that despite the constraints in low and middle income countries at the present time, the IADPSG criteria appears to be the best. This will also help to bring out a uniform criteria for screening and diagnosis of GDM worldwide.
