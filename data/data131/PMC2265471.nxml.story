The transcription factor Myc plays a critical role in regulating diverse cell-fate decisions, including growth, proliferation, and programmed cell death. Underscoring its importance, Myc expression is often found to be deregulated in cancers. However, the dynamic mechanism by which Myc is controlled by its upstream signaling proteins remains unclear. To address this issue, we analyze a well-defined signaling module for Myc regulation using a kinetic model constrained by experimental data and observations. In this module, Myc acts as an integrator of its upstream signals that differentially regulate its stability. We show that this module can enable highly sensitive Myc response to the temporal features of the input signals, but not to their maximum amplitudes. We further suggest that this module represents a generic post-translational mechanism for signal sensing and integration in diverse signaling networks. Our work offers insight into the “design” of natural biological networks and makes predictions that can guide further experimental studies on Myc regulation. Moreover, it defines a simple signal processing unit that may be useful for engineering synthetic gene circuits to carry out cell-based computation.
