The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is one of a large group of cell surface receptors that allow cells to respond to growth-stimulating signals in their environment. Upon sensing of growth factor, the EGFR is activated, which triggers a signaling cascade leading to the cell nucleus and ultimately initiating cell division. The first event following receptor activation is an intramolecular kinase reaction that results in the introduction of phosphate groups onto several specific amino acids (phosphorylation sites or P-sites) in the tail of the EGFR protein. Thus, the tail of the receptor undergoes self-phosphorylation, which involves conformational motions enabling the various P-sites to access the catalytic site. The structure of the tail of the receptor is unknown, and hence the mechanism of the self-phosphorylation reaction is not well understood. To investigate this mechanism, we generated a structural model of the EGFR protein and performed computer simulations of EGFR P-site/catalytic site binding reactions. These simulations indicated how the distribution of P-sites along the tail of the receptor and restrictions in molecular movements of the tail lead to selectivity in the phosphorylation of the different P-sites. Our simulations yielded unique insights into the mechanism of EGFR self-phosphorylation that have important biological implications.
