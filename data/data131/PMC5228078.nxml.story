Oxaliplatin (L-OHP) is a platinum compound that is widely used to treat certain solid tumors, including gastric tumors. L-OHP is an effective anti-cancer treatment; however, its usage increases the probability of patients developing hepatic injury with inflammation, referred to as chemotherapy-associated steatohepatitis. The present study aimed to evaluate the outcome of L-OHP treatment combined with polyenephosphatidylcholine (PPC), a major component of essential phospholipids used to treat steatohepatitis, on SGC-7901 gastric cancer cell proliferation. This would help to determine whether combination therapy with L-OHP and PPC is clinically beneficial for patients with gastric cancer. The viability of SGC-7901 cells was verified by an MTT assay; flow cytometry was used to analyze the cell cycle and rates of cell apoptosis; oxidation-related indicators were measured by spectrophotometry, and the expression of cell cycle- and apoptosis-related proteins was determined by western blotting. The results demonstrated that L-OHP significantly inhibited SGC-7901 cell growth in a dose- and time-dependent manner (F=194.193, P<0.01 and F=12.428, P=0.01, respectively). Furthermore, PPC stimulated the growth of SGC-7901 cells and greatly promoted their apoptosis induced by L-OHP, which was supported by the upregulation of cytochrome
