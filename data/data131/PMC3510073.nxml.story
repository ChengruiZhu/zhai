Mathematical models are developed to better understand interactions between components of a system that together govern the overall behavior. Mathematical models of sleep have helped to elucidate the neuronal cell groups that are involved in promoting sleep and wake behavior and the transitions between them. However, to be able to take full advantage of these models one must be able to estimate the value of all included variables accurately. Data assimilation refers to methods that allow the user to combine noisy measurements of just a few system variables with the mathematical model of that system to estimate all variables, including those originally inaccessible for measurement. Using these techniques we show that we can reconstruct the unmeasured variables and parameters of a mathematical model of the sleep-wake network. These reconstructed estimates can then be used to better understand the underlying neuronal behavior that results in sleep and wake activity. Because sleep is implicated in a wide array of neurological disorders from epilepsy to schizophrenia, we anticipate that this framework will enable better understanding of the link between sleep and the rest of the brain and provide for better, more targeted, therapies.
