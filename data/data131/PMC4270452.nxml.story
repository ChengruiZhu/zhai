Over the past 20 years, astrocytes, a type of brain cells that were considerably disregarded, have gradually been found to actually display remarkable properties. In contrast with neurons, which communicate through changes in their membrane potential, astrocytes communicate as networks through propagated changes in their internal calcium concentration. While still hotly debated, recent findings even indicate that astrocytic activity could influence neuronal activity in several ways, including the modulation of synaptic plasticity between neurons. How exactly these astrocytes react to neuronal activity as individual cells and as a network is however still unclear. In this work, we address this question by using neuron-astrocyte cell cultures that we stimulate with multi-electrode arrays in conjunction with a computational model of neuron-astrocyte communication. Our results show that astrocytes respond to neuronal activity in a frequency-dependent manner through glutamate signaling. We also propose that the heterogeneity of astrocyte response time and oscillation frequencies that emerges from our experiments could be linked to their network organization. Since astrocytes are known to communicate with neurons by releasing signaling molecules upon activation, our findings, by shedding new light on astrocyte responses to neuronal activity, help uncover the complex mechanisms underlying neuron-astrocyte cross-talk.
