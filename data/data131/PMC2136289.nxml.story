 Human complement is inactivated by plasmin, the proteolytic enzyme of plasma or serum active at or near neutrality. The addition of streptokinase to human serum, which converts plasminogen to plasmin, also causes the inactivation of complement components C'2 and C'4 and varying amounts of C'1. C'3 is the most resistant to inactivation by plasmin. Chloroform-activated human plasmin and bovine plasmin also destroy these components of complement, but are less effective than the streptokinase-activated enzyme. The inactivation of complement by the addition of streptokinase to human serum is inhibited by high hydrogen ion concentrations, low temperature, and elevated ionic strength. The inactivation of the components of complement in various fractions of serum is influenced by the available plasminogen and the content of plasmin inhibitors in these fractions. Certain similarities are pointed out between the components of complement and the factors in the plasmin system and between the inactivation of the components of complement by antigen-antibody reactions, by specific agents, and by plasmin. The possible significance of these relationships in immune hemolysis and complement fixation, and the possible role of the plasmin system in the instability of complement and the development of anticomplementary properties in serum are discussed.
