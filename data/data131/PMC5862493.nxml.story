New experimental techniques based on optogenetics allow neuronal activity to be manipulated with a high degree of spatial and temporal precision. This opens up new prospects for testing computational models of neuronal function, including questions such as the role of dendrites in neuronal gain control. However, compartmental models in computational neuroscience have not, until now, incorporated the kinetic models of opsins that are required in order to directly match the predictions of a computational model with observed optogenetic experimental results. Here, we introduce an approach for computational optogenetic modeling to test hypotheses, demonstrating it with application to the role of dendrites in neuronal gain control. We find that gain modulability is indicated by dendritic morphology, with pyramidal cell-like shapes optimally receptive to modulation. All dendritic subdomains are required for gain modulationâ€”partial illumination is insufficient. Due to the simulation framework used, these results are directly testable through optogenetic experiments. Computational optogenetic models thus can be used to improve and refine experimental protocols for direct testing of theories of neural function.
