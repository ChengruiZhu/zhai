Some evolutionary theories predict that the X chromosome will be enriched for genes with male functions. However, recent studies showed there had been gene traffic in which autosomal male-biased genes were retroposed from X-linked parental genes. A question remains about whether this pattern also holds for all types of new genes. Herein, using comparative genomic analysis, we dated all human and mouse genes to the vertebrate phylogenetic tree. We found that the X chromosome evolved with two bursts of gene origination events. The recent burst includes mainly male-biased genes in contrast to older X-linked genes that are often female-biased in expression. Meiotic sex chromosome inactivation contributes to this dynamic since it silences the older but not the younger X-linked genes. The older burst was after the split of eutherian mammals and the marsupial opossum, and the genes from this burst were quickly incorporated into transcriptional networks of multiple tissues, especially in the brain. The transcriptional expansion, together with the rapid protein evolution of the preexisting old X-linked genes, suggests that positive selection was acting in the early evolution of the mammalian X chromosome. These two lines of findings revealed extensive gene evolution in the mammalian X chromosome.
