Cancer is a disease characterized by unregulated proliferation of transformed cells. To meet the increased biosynthetic demands of proliferation, biosynthetic building blocks required for cellular growth must be generated in large quantities. As cancer cells increase their anabolic metabolism to promote cell growth, there is significant interest in targeting these processes for cancer therapy. Metformin is a drug prescribed to treat Type II diabetes that has gained interest as an anti-tumor agent due to its suppressive effects on cancer cell proliferation. However, how metformin works to slow cancer cell growth has remained poorly understood. Here we show that metformin arrests cancer cell proliferation by starving mitochondria of the necessary metabolic intermediates required for anabolic metabolism in tumor cells. This results in reduced proliferation in part due to decreased synthesis of lipids used for membrane biosynthesis. We also show that some cancer cells use alternative metabolic pathways to synthesize lipids independently of mitochondrial metabolism, and that these cells are resistant to the antigrowth effects of metformin. Better understanding of mechanisms of metformin resistance will be crucial for metformin to be used as an effective anticancer agent.
