This study assessed time-course changes of the small intestinal lesions during long-term treatment with diclofenac sodium plus omeprazole and the effects of irsogladine on such lesions. Thirty two healthy volunteers were treated with diclofenac sodium (75 mg/day) plus omeprazole (10 mg/day) for 6 weeks, with irsogladine (4 mg/day) added from weeks 6 to 10 (Group A) or with diclofenac sodium plus irsogladine for 6 weeks (Group B). Five volunteers received diclofenac sodium plus omeprazole for 10 weeks (Group C). Subjects underwent capsule endoscopy at each time. In Group A, the number of lesions remarkably increased at week 2, but the worse was not found at week 6 compared with week 2, whereas no exacerbation of lesions was observed in Group B. Additional treatment with irsogladine from weeks 6 to 10 in Group A significantly decreased the number of lesions at weeks 10 compared with Group C. In Group C, no significant change in lesions was observed since weeks 2. In conclusions, a PPI did not prevent the occurrence of small intestinal damage. However such lesions were not aggravated since weeks 2. These suggested mucosal adaptation may occur in the small intestine. Irsogladine was effective in both preventing and healing such lesions.
