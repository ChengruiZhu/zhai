Elevated tumor suppressor p53 expression has been associated with heart diseases, including the diabetic heart. However, its precise role in the pathogenesis of diabetic cardiomyopathy (DCM) remains unclear. We hypothesized that the development of DCM is attributed to up-regulated p53-mediated both early cardiac cell death and persistent cell senescence, glycolytic and angiogenetic dysfunctions. The present study investigated the effect of p53 inhibition with its specific inhibitor pifithrin-α (PFT-α) on the pathogenesis of DCM and its associated mechanisms. Type 1 diabetes was induced with multiple low doses of streptozotocin. Both hyperglycemic and age-matched control mice were treated with and without PFT-α five times a week for 2 months and then sacrificed at 3 and 6 months post-diabetes. Treatment with PFT-α significantly prevented the progression of diabetes-induced cardiac remodeling and dysfunction (i.e., DCM). Mechanistically, the inhibition of p53 prevented the cardiac apoptosis during early-stage diabetes (0.5 month), attenuated diabetes-induced cell senescence (3 and 6 months), and improved both glycolytic and angiogenic defects by increasing hypoxia-induced factor (HIF)-1α protein stability and upregulating HIF-1α transcription of specific target genes at 3 and 6 months after diabetes. Therefore, the targeted inhibition of p53 in diabetic individuals may provide a novel approach for the prevention of DCM.
