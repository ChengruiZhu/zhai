For the present study, 25 Holstein and crossbreed, 3 to 7-year-old cows diagnosed with left displacement of the abomasum and 15 healthy cattle as control groups over a period of 2 years were used. LDA diagnosis was based on clinical examinations (high-pitched bell-like sounds) and confirmed by laparoscopy. Two blood samples were collected from each case through the jugular vein including one tube containing EDTA for hematological parameters analysis and one tube without anticoagulant for biochemical analysis. Hematological parameters including Ca, P, Mg, Cl, AST, urea, and glucose concentrations were measured by routine procedures. Serum was determined by use of an atomic absorption spectrophotometer, and Na and K values were obtained using a flame photometer. The results of this study showed that Hb, percentage of PCV, total leukocytic, neutrophils, total protein count plus AST, urea, and glucose concentrations were significantly increased in the LDA cases compared to the control group, whereas a marked decrease in plasma electrolyte concentrations (hyponatremia, hypochloremia, hypokalemia, and hypocalcemia) was found in 88–92% of LDA cases. In conclusion, in the present study, it was shown that DA causes alterations in the clinical, hematological, and biochemical profiles and these alterations can be more severe when DA is concurrent with other diseases.
