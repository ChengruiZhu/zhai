The tumor suppressor PTEN dephosphorylates focal adhesion kinase (FAK) and inhibits integrin-mediated cell spreading and cell migration. We demonstrate here that expression of PTEN selectively inhibits activation of the extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway. PTEN expression in glioblastoma cells lacking the protein resulted in inhibition of integrin-mediated MAP kinase activation. Epidermal growth factor (EGF) and platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF)- induced MAPK activation were also blocked. To determine the specific point of inhibition in the Ras/Raf/ MEK/ERK pathway, we examined these components after stimulation by fibronectin or growth factors. Shc phosphorylation and Ras activity were inhibited by expression of PTEN, whereas EGF receptor autophosphorylation was unaffected. The ability of cells to spread at normal rates was partially rescued by coexpression of constitutively activated MEK1, a downstream component of the pathway. In addition, focal contact formation was enhanced as indicated by paxillin staining. The phosphatase domain of PTEN was essential for all of these functions, because PTEN with an inactive phosphatase domain did not suppress MAP kinase or Ras activity. In contrast to its effects on ERK, PTEN expression did not affect c-Jun NH
