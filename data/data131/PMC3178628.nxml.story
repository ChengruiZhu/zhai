Medicines to cure infectious diseases usually target proteins in the pathogens. Since pathogens have short life cycles, the targeted proteins can rapidly evolve and make the medicines ineffective, especially in viruses such as HIV. However, since viruses have very small genomes, they must exploit the cellular machinery of the host to propagate. Therefore, disrupting the activity of selected host proteins may impede viruses. Three recent experiments have discovered hundreds of such proteins in human cells that HIV depends upon. Surprisingly, these three sets have very little overlap. In this work, we demonstrate that this discrepancy can be explained by considering physical interactions between the human proteins in these studies. Moreover, we exploit these interactions to predict new dependency factors for HIV. Our predictions show very significant overlaps with human proteins that are known to interact with HIV proteins and with human cellular processes that are known to be subverted by the virus. Most importantly, we show that proteins predicted by us may play a prominent role in affecting HIV-related disease progression in lymph nodes. Therefore, our predictions constitute a powerful resource for experimentalists who desire to discover new human proteins that can control the spread of HIV.
