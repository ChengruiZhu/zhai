Emerging evidence indicates that cancer-derived exosomes contribute to angiogenesis, tumor immunology and invasion. However, whether cancer cell-derived exosomes regulate the migration and invasion of the cancer cell itself, and the underlying mechanisms are not well understood. In the present study, exosomes derived from the 786-0 human renal cancer cell line were isolated, purified and 100 Î¼g/ml were co-cultured with 786-0 cells for 24 h. The 786-0 cells were harvested for a cell invasion and migration assay. The expression of chemokine receptor type 4 (CXCR4) and matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) in the 786-0 cells was examined by western blot analysis and revealed that the migration and invasion capabilities of the 786-0 cells were increased, however, the cell adhesion abilities were decreased as a result of the 24-h treatment with 786-0-derived exosomes. Furthermore, the expression levels of CXCR4 and MMP-9 in the 786-0 cells were increased. In conclusion, the 786-0 renal cancer cell line-derived exosomes increased migration and invasion, however, they decreased the adhesion ability of the 786-0 cells. The exosomes may have increased the CXCR4 and MMP-9 expression levels in the 786-0 cells. These findings indicated that renal tumor-derived exosomes may contribute to renal cancer development and progression.
