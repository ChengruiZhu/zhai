Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a systemic inflammatory disease that mainly affects the synovial joints. Although involvement of the fibroblast growth factor (FGF) signaling pathway has been suggested as an important modulator in RA development, no clear evidence has been provided. In this study, we found that synovial fluid basic FGF (bFGF) concentration was significantly higher in RA than in osteoarthritis (OA) patients. bFGF stimulates proliferation and migration of human fibroblast-like synoviocytes (FLSs) by activation of the bFGF-FGF receptor 3 (FGFR3)-ribosomal S6 kinase 2 (RSK2) signaling axis. Moreover, a molecular docking study revealed that kaempferol inhibited FGFR3 activity by binding to the active pocket of the FGFR3 kinase domain. Kaempferol forms hydrogen bonds with the FGFR3 backbone oxygen of Glu555 and Ala558 and the side chain of Lys508. Notably, the inhibition of bFGF-FGFR3–RSK2 signaling by kaempferol suppresses the proliferation and migration of RA FLSs and the release of activated T-cell-mediated inflammatory cytokines, such as IL-17, IL-21, and TNF-α. We further found that activated phospho-FGFR3 and -RSK2 were more highly observed in RA than in OA synovium. The hyperplastic lining and sublining lymphoid aggregate layers of RA synovium showed p-RSK2-expressing CD68
