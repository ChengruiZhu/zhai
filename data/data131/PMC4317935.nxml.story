TMEPAI/PMEPA1 is a transmembrane protein that was originally identified as a prostatic RNA, the synthesis of which is induced by testosterone or its derivatives. We have recently identified TMEPAI as a direct target gene of transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β)/Smad signaling that participates in negative feedback control of the duration and intensity of TGF-β/Smad signaling. TMEPAI is constitutively and highly expressed in many types of cancer and is associated with poor prognosis. Here, we report that TMEPAI is highly expressed in the lung adenocarcinoma cell lines Calu3, NCI-H23, and RERF-LC-KJ. Expression of TMEPAI in these cancer cells was significantly suppressed by a TGF-β receptor kinase antagonist, SB208, and by TGF-β neutralizing antibodies. These results suggest that constitutive expression of TMEPAI in these cancer cells depends on autocrine TGF-β stimulation. Knockdown of TMEPAI in Calu3 and NCI-H23 cells enhanced levels of Smad2 phosphorylation and significantly suppressed cell proliferation in the presence of TGF-β, indicating that highly expressed TMEPAI suppresses levels of Smad phosphorylation in these cancer cells and reduces the growth inhibitory effects of TGF-β/Smad signaling. Furthermore, knockdown of TMEPAI in Calu3 and NCI-H23 cells suppressed sphere formation
