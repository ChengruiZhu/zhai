This study was designed to determine whether volumetric imaging could identify consistent alternative prescription methods to Manchester/point A when prescribing radiation dose in the treatment of cervical cancer using HDR intracavitary brachytherapy (ICBT). One hundred and twenty‐five treatment plans of 25 patients treated for carcinoma of the cervix were reviewed retrospectively. Each patient received 5 fractions of HDR ICBT following initial cisplatin‐based pelvic chemoradiation, and radiation dose was originally prescribed to point A (ICRU‐38). The gross tumor volume (GTV) and high‐risk clinical target volume (HR‐CTV) were contoured in three dimensions on the CT datasets, and inferior–superior, anterior–posterior, and left–right dimensions HR‐CTV were recorded along with multiple anatomic and skeletal dimensions for each patient. The least square–best fit regression lines were plotted between one half of the HR‐CTV width and pelvic cavity dimension at femoral head level and at maximum cavity dimension. The points in both plots lie reasonably close to straight lines and are well defined by straight lines with slopes of 0.15 and 0.17; intercept on y‐axes of
