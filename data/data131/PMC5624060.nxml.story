Disregulation of genes making up the mammalian circadian clock has been associated with different forms of cancer. This study aimed to address how the circadian clock genes behave over the course of treatment for both the acute and chronic forms of leukemia and whether any could be used as potential biomarkers as a read-out for therapeutic efficacy. Expression profiling for both core and ancillary clock genes revealed that the majority of clock genes are down-regulated in acute myeloid leukemia patients, except for Cry2, which is up-regulated towards the end of treatment. A similar process was seen in acute lymphocytic leukemia patients; however, here, Cry2 expression came back up towards control levels upon treatment completion. In addition, all of the core clock genes were down-regulated in both chronic forms of leukemia (chronic myeloid leukemia and chronic lymphocytic leukemia), except for Cry2, which was not affected when the disease was diagnosed. Furthermore, the NAD(+) â€“ dependent protein deacetylase Sirt1 has been proposed to have a dual role in both control of circadian clock circuitry and promotion of cell survival by inhibiting apoptotic pathways in cancer. We used a pharmacological-based approach to see whether Sirt1 played a role in regulating the circadian clock circuitry in both acute and chronic forms of leukemia. Our results suggest that interfering with Sirt1 leads to a partial restoration of BMAL1 oscillation in chronic myeloid leukemia patient samples. Furthermore, interfering with Sirt1 activity led to both the induction and repression of circadian clock genes in both acute and chronic forms of leukemia, which makes it a potential therapeutic target to either augment existing therapies for chronic leukemia or to act as a means of facilitating chronotherapy in order to maximize both the effectiveness of existing therapies and to minimize therapy-associated toxicity.
