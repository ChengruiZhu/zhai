Treatment of mouse lymphoma S49 cells with D,L-alpha- difluoromethylornithine (DFMO), an inhibitor of ornithine decarboxylase, depleted cellular polyamine levels and stopped cell growth. The cells were arrested predominantly in G1. Thus, polyamine depletion may lead to a regulatory growth arrest in S49 cells. We tested two hypotheses regarding the relationship of growth arrest mediated by polyamine limitation to that mediated by cyclic AMP (cAMP). The hypothesis that cAMP-induced arrest results from polyamine depletion is not tenable, because the arrest could not be reversed by addition of exogenous polyamines, and because cellular polyamine levels do not drop in dibuturyl cyclic AMP (Bt2cAMP)-arrested cells. The hypothesis that polyamine-mediated growth arrest is effected via modulation of cAMP levels or cAMP-dependent protein kinase activity was also shown to be incorrect, because a S49 variant deficient in cAMP- dependent protein kinase was arrested by DFMO. The activities of the polyamine-synthesizing enzymes ornithine decarboxylase (ODC) and S- adenosyl methionine decarboxylase (SAMD) are both reduced in Bt2cAMP- treated cells to about 10% of that in control populations, as shown previously. DFMO diminishes ODC activity and augments SAMD activity in both untreated and Bt2cAMP-treated cells, leading to polyamine depletion in both cases.
