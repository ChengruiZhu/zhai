As a polymerase copies a DNA strand, it may briefly pause. The pauses of the polymerase are important factors in the formation of large-scale deletions in mitochondrial DNA, a major cause of pathogenicity in mitochondrial diseases. To investigate these pauses, we have developed a simulation of the function of the mitochondrial DNA polymerase. As well as the wild-type polymerase, we consider two important mutant forms of the polymerase. Based on the simulation we predict that one of these two mutants would experience severe polymerase pauses, while the second would have only slightly longer pauses than the wild-type. This is important information for understanding the differences in pathogenicity between these two mutant polymerases. Furthermore, based on the simulation we determine that a particular reaction of the polymerase, the disassociation of the polymerase:DNA complex, is the most critical reaction determining the length of the polymerase pauses. Of all of the complex functions of the polymerase, the disassociation reaction has had the least attention experimentally and medically. Our simulation model points out that this neglected behavior of the polymerase should be examined more carefully in future research.
