 registry, we identified 16 206 adults 65 years or older with an out‐of‐hospital cardiac arrest between 2005 and 2010. Among 1127 patients who were discharged alive, we evaluated whether 1‐year mortality, cumulative readmission incidence, and follow‐up inpatient costs differed according to patients’ race, sex, initial cardiac arrest rhythm, bystander delivery of cardiopulmonary resuscitation, discharge neurological status, and functional status (hospital discharge disposition). Overall 1‐year mortality after hospital discharge was 31.8%. Among survivors, there were no long‐term mortality differences by sex, race, or initial cardiac arrest rhythm, but worse functional status and severe neurological disability at discharge were associated with higher mortality. Moreover, compared with first responders, cardiopulmonary resuscitation delivered by bystanders was associated with 23% lower mortality (hazard ratio 0.77 [confidence interval 0.58–1.02]). Besides mortality, 638 (56.6%) patients were readmitted within the first year, and the cumulative readmission incidence was 197 per 100 patient‐years. Mean 1‐year inpatient costs were $23 765±41 002. Younger age, black race, severe neurological disability at discharge, and hospital disposition to a skilled nursing or rehabilitation facility were each associated with higher 1‐year inpatient costs (
