Delayed bowel erosion by peritoneal dialysis catheter is rare with fewer than thirty cases having been reported in the literature. This complication is usually encountered when the catheter is kept dormant. Two cases have also been reported with catheters in active use. The risk factors for bowel erosion include immunosuppression, diverticulosis, and amyloidosis. An 80-year-old male with chronic kidney disease Stage 5 due to hypertensive nephrosclerosis underwent chronic ambulatory peritoneal dialysis catheter insertion. Due to improvement in the glomerular filtration rate and clinical parameters including extracellular fluid volume status, peritoneal dialysis was not initiated. Weekly catheter flushes were performed. After 5 months, he developed watery diarrhea after a regular flushing episode. Computed tomography scan revealed the catheter displaced into the sigmoid colon with the tip in the rectum. He was managed successfully with catheter removal alone and conservative treatment. He remains asymptomatic at 3-month follow-up. This case is presented to emphasize the fact that delayed bowel erosion can happen with dormant catheter even in the absence of risk factors. Periodic flushing has not prevented this complication in our patient. Perforations can be self-curing when diagnosed early and when patients present without features of peritonitis or sepsis. Such cases can be managed successfully with catheter removal alone.
