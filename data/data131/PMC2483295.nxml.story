In response to changes in the environment, animals can take shelter while the sessile plants must adapt to the prevalent conditions. Great plasticity in growth and development are striking examples of how plants cope with a changing environment. In plants, light is both a source of energy and an essential informational cue perceived by several classes of photoreceptors. Phytochrome-mediated light signaling is particularly well studied, because these photoreceptors control all aspects of the plant life cycle. The phytochromes are cytoplasmic in the dark and must enter the nucleus upon light activation to initiate signal transduction. How this important light-regulated event is achieved is poorly understood. Here we describe the function of an evolutionary conserved protein called FHY1 for Far-red elongated HYpocotyl 1. We demonstrate that FHY1 interacts with a light-activated phytochrome in the cytoplasm, allowing the complex to be transported into the nucleus. Interestingly, if this phytochrome can enter the nucleus by another mechanism, FHY1 is no longer required for seedling development, indicating that a major function of FHY1 is to chaperone an activated phytochrome into the nucleus. Our experiments suggest that this mechanism uncovered in Arabidopsis is widely conserved among flowering plants.
