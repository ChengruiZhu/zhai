 by suppressing the expression of inducible NO synthase and cyclooxygenase-2 at the mRNA and protein levels in RAW 264.7 macrophages. Furthermore, schisandrin A was demonstrated to reduce the LPS-induced secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines, including tumor necrosis factor-α and interleukin-1β; this was accompanied by a simultaneous decrease in the respective mRNA and protein levels in the macrophages. In addition, the LPS- induced translocation of nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB), as well as activation of mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) and phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase (PI3K)/Akt pathways were inhibited by schisandrin A. Furthermore, schisandrin A significantly diminished the LPS-stimulated accumulation of intracellular reactive oxygen species, and effectively enhanced the expression of NF erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) and heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1). These results suggested that schisandrin A has a protective effect against LPS-induced inflammatory and oxidative responses in RAW 264.7 cells by inhibiting the NF-κB, MAPK and PI3K/Akt pathways; these effects are mediated, at least in part, by the activation of the Nrf2/HO-1 pathway. Based on these results, it is concluded that schisandrin A may have therapeutic potential for treating inflammatory and oxidative disorders caused by over-activation of macrophages.
