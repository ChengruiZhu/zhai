Diseases are known to play important roles in regulating and structuring populations, but the consequences of disease outbreaks for entire communities and ecosystems are not as well understood. The Serengeti wildebeest were historically kept at low numbers by the rinderpest virus, but underwent a population explosion (irruption) after rinderpest was eradicated in the 1960s. We examined nearly a half-century of data to test the hypothesis that this irruption was responsible for a decline in the frequency of fires in this ecosystem (through increased grazing and a reduction in fuel loads), and that this in turn increased the density of trees. We found strong evidence for this indirect link between rinderpest and tree density, and less support for the role of other factors such as elephants and climate. We also investigated the consequences of this chain of events for ecosystem carbon, and suggest that the combined effects of increased grazing intensity by wildebeest, reduced fire, and increasing tree density may have shifted the Serengeti from being a net source to a net sink for carbon. This would imply that seemingly small ecological perturbations such as disease outbreaks have the potential to profoundly affect ecosystem function.
