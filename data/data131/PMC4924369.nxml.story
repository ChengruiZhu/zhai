The purpose of this study was to identify the optimal local treatment modalities for International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) stage I‐II small‐cell carcinoma of the cervix (SCCC), including cancer‐directed surgery (CDS) and/or radiotherapy (RT). The Surveillance Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) database was used to identify SCCC patients from 1988 to 2012, and analyzed using Kaplan–Meier survival and Cox regression proportional hazard methods to determine factors significant for cause‐specific survival (CSS) and overall (OS). A total of 208 patients of SCCC were enrolled. The median follow‐up time was 31 months. Fifty‐eight (27.9%) patients were treated with primary CDS, 88 (42.3%) patients underwent CDS combined with RT, and 62 (29.8%) patients were treated with primary RT. Univariate and multivariate analyses showed that local treatment modalities were independent prognostic factors for CSS and OS. Patients who had undergone CDS had better CSS and OS, compared with patients who had been treated with combined CDS and RT or RT alone. The 5‐year CSS and OS of entire group was 49.8% and 46.4%, respectively. The 5‐year CSS in the groups of patients receiving CDS, CDS combined with RT, and RT alone were 67.9%, 49.7%, and 32.6%, respectively (
