Microbial communities underlie a variety of important biochemical processes ranging from underground cave formation to gold mining or the onset of obesity. Metabolic fluxes describe how carbon and energy flow through the microbial community and therefore provide insights that are rarely captured by other techniques, such as metatranscriptomics or metaproteomics. The most authoritative method to measure fluxes for pure cultures consists of feeding the cells a labeled carbon source and deriving the fluxes from the ensuing metabolite labeling pattern (typically amino acids). Since we cannot easily separate cells of metabolite for each species in a community, this approach is not generally applicable to microbial communities. Here we present a method to derive fluxes from the labeling of peptides, instead of amino acids. This approach has the advantage that peptides can be assigned to each species in a community in a high-throughput fashion through modern proteomic methods. We show that, by using this method, it is theoretically possible to recover the same amount of information as through the standard approach, if enough peptides are used. We computationally tested this method with a well-characterized simple microbial community consisting of two species.
