 shows the overall approach to using this method for evaluating data stream types. Our first step was identifying a list of priority diseases to build surveillance windows for and our primary sources were our SME panel, CDC priorities, as well as DOD priorities. We also conducted a literature review to support our selection of diseases. We ensured that there was representation of human, animal and plant diseases and there was enough data available for selected outbreaks to facilitate evaluation of all data stream types identified. We then selected representative outbreaks for diseases to generate a timeline for defining surveillance windows. Surveillance windows were then defined (based on four specific biosurveillance goals developed by LANL) and information for applicable data streams was collected for the duration of the outbreak. A data stream was deemed useful if it was determined to be available within the defined surveillance window. In addition, evaluation of the ideal use case of the data streams was performed. In essence, if used more effectively could this data stream provide greater support to understanding, detection, warning or management of disease outbreaks or event situations?
