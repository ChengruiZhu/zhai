Nerve block administration in concert with general anesthesia can help manage post-operative pain and provide favorable muscle relaxation of the operative leg in hip surgery. However, the optimal nerve blockade_if any_for arthroscopic surgery of the hip remains undefined. Considerations specific to hip arthroscopy include control of intra-operative pain, adequate muscle relaxation to allow for distraction for work in the central compartment, and post-operative pain control. Dold et al. recently reported in AJSM that a pre-operative femoral nerve block administered in concert with general anesthesia led to decreased patient-reported pain scores at the 60 minute mark post-operatively. Given this demonstrated benefit of the pre-operative femoral nerve block, we hypothesized that a regional block that anesthetized the femoral nerve and the lateral femoral cutaneous nerve (as the fascia iliaca block does), or one that anesthetized the obturator nerve in addition to the femoral and lateral femoral cutaneous nerves (i.e. the lumbar plexus block), would provide additional benefit. The purpose of this study is to examine the effects of pre-operative fascia iliaca and lumbar plexus nerve blocks on post-operative pain and secondary post-operative variables following arthroscopic surgery of the hip.
