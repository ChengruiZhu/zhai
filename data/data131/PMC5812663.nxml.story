In contrast to animal cells, plant cells are encased in a rigid cell wall providing among others the necessary rigidity to contain the turgor pressure that allows the plant as a whole to raise itself against gravity. In order to maintain this mechanical integrity while growing requires plant cells to rigorously control their expansion. In this they are aided by a plant-unique intracellular structure called the cortical array, an organised set of long filamentous protein polymers called microtubules attached to the inside of the cell membrane. Experiments and modelling studies have revealed how collisions between these highly dynamic polymers promote the spontaneous alignment of microtubules observed in cells. However, it was hitherto unknown how the shape of cells influences this self-organisation process and helps in determining the overall orientation of the cortical array. The latter is key in deciding the axis of cell expansion and the orientation of cell division planes. Here we develop, validate and apply a simulation framework for studying the dynamics of interacting microtubules on arbitrary triangulated surfaces that can be extracted from three-dimensional reconstruction of real cells from confocal microscopy images. This allows us to start unravelling the delicate interplay between cell shape, effects of sharp cell-edges and developmental cues on the organisation of the cortical array.
