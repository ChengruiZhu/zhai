The current models of circadian clocks in flies and mammals involve the formation of complexes between clock proteins in the cytoplasm. These complexes are usually heterodimers (that is, made up of two different clock proteins) and appear to enter the nucleus at certain times of the circadian day in order to shut down their own gene expression by deactivating specific transcription factors. After progressive phosphorylation the repressor proteins eventually are degraded so that a new cycle of transcription can begin. Here we present evidence that in addition to heterodimeric complexes, the clock protein PERIOD (PER) also forms homodimers (pairs of identical proteins). Based on a structural model a PER mutant was designed, which is not able to form homodimers but can still bind to its partner TIMELESS (TIM). Flies expressing this mutant PER protein show abnormal clock function in regard to PER nuclear translocation, repressor activity, and behavioral rhythms. The circadian clock model in flies therefore needs to be extended by adding the PER:PER homodimer as a functional unit. Recent structural studies with mammalian PER proteins suggest that homodimers between clock proteins are an important general feature of eukaryotic clocks.
