Recent advances in experimental methods have produced a deluge of protein–protein interactions data. However, these methods do not supply information on which specific protein regions are physically in contact during the interactions. Identifying these regions (interfaces) is fundamental for scientific disciplines that require detailed characterizations of protein interactions. In this work, we present a computational method that identifies groups of proteins with similar interfaces. This is achieved by relying on the observation that proteins with common interaction partners tend to interact through similar interfaces. The proposed method retrieves protein interactions from public data repositories and groups proteins that share a sensible number of interacting partners. Proteins within the same group are then labeled with the same “interacting motif” identifier (iMotif). The evaluation performed using known protein domains and structural binding sites suggests that the method is better suited for proteins with multiple interacting partners (hubs). Using yeast data, we show that the cellular essentiality of a gene better correlates with the number of interacting motifs than with the absolute number of interactions.
