 seedlings as compared with protochlorophyll, the pigment precursor of chlorophyll, it is possible to show that the carotenoids do not act as filters of the light incident on the plant in the blue region of the spectrum where they absorb heavily. This suggests that the carotenoids are located behind the protochlorophyll molecules in the plastids. 2. Since the carotenoids do not screen and light is necessary for chlorophyll formation, an effectiveness spectrum of protochlorophyll can be obtained which is the reciprocal of the light energy necessary to produce a constant amount of chlorophyll with different wavelengths. The relative effectiveness of sixteen spectral regions in forming chlorophyll was determined. 3. From the effectiveness spectrum, one can conclude that protochlorophyll is a blue-green pigment with major peaks of absorption at 445 mµ, and 645 mµ, and with smaller peaks at 575 and 545 mµ. The blue peak is sharp, narrow, and high, the red peak being broader and shorter. This differs from previous findings where the use of rougher methods indicated that red light was more effective than blue and did not give the position of the peaks of absorption or their relative heights. 4. The protochlorophyll curve is similar to but not identical with chlorophyll. The ratio of the peaks of absorption in the blue as compared to the red is very similar to chlorophyll a, but the position of the peaks resembles chlorophyll b. 5. There is an excellent correspondence between the absorption properties of this "active" protochlorophyll and what is known of the absorption of a chemically known pigment studied in impure extracts of seed coats of the Cucurbitaceae. Conclusive proof of the identity of the two substances awaits chemical purification, but the evidence here favors the view that the pumpkin seed substance, which is chemically chlorophyll a minus two hydrogens, is identical with the precursor of chlorophyll formation found in etiolated plants.
