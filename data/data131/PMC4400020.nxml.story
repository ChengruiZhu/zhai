Mitochondria contain genes that encode the machinery needed to power cells. Unlike the nuclear genome, the mitochondrial genome is typically inherited from one parent only (uniparental inheritance). The most common explanation for uniparental inheritance is the genomic conflict theory, which states that uniparental inheritance evolved to prevent the spread of ‘selfish’ mitochondria that replicate quickly but produce energy inefficiently. Current explanations have a major problem: when using realistic parameters, mathematical models cannot show that uniparental inheritance can replace biparental inheritance. Clearly, we need a new explanation that fits with standard population-genetic theory. Recent evidence suggests cells may incur a cost when they carry multiple types of mitochondria. Here we show mathematically that uniparental inheritance could have evolved to avoid the costs of maintaining multiple mitochondrial lineages within a cell. Our results explain the long-standing evolutionary mystery of uniparental inheritance and provide insight into the evolution of mating types and binary sexes. Selection against heteroplasmy also has implications for the evolution of the mitochondrial genome because new mitochondrial haplotypes always lead to heteroplasmy before becoming fixed in the population. Thus, selection against heteroplasmy may explain why mtDNA coding-genes have slower substitution rates than analogous genes within the nucleus.
