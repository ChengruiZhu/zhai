Despite decades of attempted vector control, several vector-borne diseases remain endemic. Recent high-profile studies suggest that candidate vaccines, particularly for dengue, may be less than completely effective as public health interventions. Nevertheless, the epidemiological consequences of using other novel approaches (e.g., transgenic strategies to reduce or replace vector populations) remain highly uncertain. Faced with unclear prospects of any one strategy succeeding in isolation, there is increasing interest in designing a comprehensive public health response to manage vector-borne diseases. Here we use a relatively simple model to study how combining vaccines, transgenic vector manipulation and antimicrobial medications can facilitate disease management. We explain why the epidemiological consequences for combining strategies are not expected to merely sum their effects. Contrary to the prevailing assumption that comprehensive disease management always yields public health benefits, we find integrating transgenic vector manipulation with clinical interventions can, in some cases, temporarily exacerbate the adverse consequences of any one strategy failing. These results highlight the need for system-specific modeling efforts aimed at assessing whether our conclusions apply to specific vector-borne diseases. We outline the implications for proceeding with public health responses integrating currently available products, as well as assessing their efficacy.
