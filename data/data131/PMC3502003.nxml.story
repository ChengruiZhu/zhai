In a previous study, we investigated slow cortical potential (SCP) N1-P2 amplitudes and N1 latencies in aided and unaided conditions, with the finding that despite being set to provide 20 or 40 dB of gain, none of the hearing aids resulted in a reliable increase in SCP response amplitude relative to the unaided (Marynewich et al., in press). The current study investigates the effects of hearing-aid processing on acoustic measures for two 1000-Hz tonal stimuli: short (60 ms) and long (757 ms), presented at three intensities (30, 50, 70 dB SPL) in aided and unaided conditions using three hearing aids (Analog, DigitalA, DigitalB) with two gain settings (20, 40 dB). Acoustic results indicate that gain achieved by the hearing aids, measured at 30 ms after stimulus onset, for both the short and long stimuli, was less than real-ear insertion gain measured with standard hearing aid test signals. Additionally, the digital hearing aids altered the rise time of the stimuli such that maximum gain was reached well past 30 ms after stimulus onset; rise times differed between the digital aids. These results indicate that aided SCP results must be cautiously interpreted and that further research is required for clinical application.
