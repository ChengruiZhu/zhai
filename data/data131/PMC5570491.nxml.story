Altered metabolism is characteristic for many human diseases including cancer. Disease progression and treatment efficacy vary between patients. Hence, we need personalized approaches to define metabolic disease phenotypes. This definition will enable us to unravel the underlying disease mechanisms and to treat individuals more efficiently. Computational modeling increasingly supports the analysis of disease mechanisms and complex data sets. The interpretation of extracellular metabolomic data sets is particularly promising since this data type is proximal to the actual metabolic phenotype altered in human diseases. Moreover, it might enable us to directly interpret disease states from serum samples in the future. Herein, we took a first step towards this ambitious goal. We generated a large set of cancer metabolic models from extracellular metabolomic data and computationally stratified the models based on their metabolic characteristics into different phenotype groups. Melanoma emerged as an interesting example of how our approach can provide insights into the intracellular metabolism from extracellular measurements. Taken together, this work paves the way to generate condition-specific models from extracellular metabolomic data and demonstrates the many ways by which distinct phenotypes can be stratified and phenotype-specific intervention targets can be predicted.
