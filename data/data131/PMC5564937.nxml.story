After chart review of included patients, 760 records were available for analysis. The multivariate regression model that best matched the data and produced the highest predictive value for surgery had a concordance index of 0.688, representing the rate at which the model correctly assigned a higher surgical risk to patients that were ultimately recommended for surgery against those who were not. Significant variables in this model were if a previous provider ordered an MRI for the patient, injury status, and patient sex. The odds ratios for a patient requiring surgery based on their status in those areas are shown in Table 1. Having an MRI ordered by a previous provider (OR=4.45) and male sex (OR=1.6) were both positive predictors of needing surgery. Indication of injury with a primary complaint of weakness or instability carried the strongest predictive effect of surgery. (OR=1, reference) The odds of surgery decreased if the patient’s primary complaint was pain or if the patient followed the answer pathway: Pain—Not Crushing Pain—Injury—No ER Visit—No Pain Raising Arm. The model can predict between a 7.5% and 95% chance of needing surgery (20% of the population required surgery). A nomogram was constructed from the model such that a patient’s response to each question correlated to a point value, and the total of those points correlated to a probability of needing surgery.
