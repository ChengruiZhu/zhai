Cancer related inflammation (CRI) plays an important role in the development of esophageal cancer (EC), and the target gene analysis shows that miR-302b potential target genes closely correlated to CRI important signaling pathways. The present study was to evaluate the inhibition of miR-302b on CRI in EC and its mechanism. We found that the expression levels of miR-302b in EC cells were lower than that in Het-1A cells, while TE11 with the lowest expression and OE33 with the highest. Inflammatory stimuli at 48 h significantly reduced expression of miR-302b in EC cells, but had no effect in Het-1A. After up-regulation of miR-302b in TE11 and down-regulation of miR-302b in OE33, it was found that miR-302b reduced CRI key transcription factors and representative cytokines. Then, over-expressed of miR-302b significantly altered potential target genes protein expressions and there was a negative correlation between miR-302b and potential target genes protein expressions (ERBB4, IRF2 and CXCR4) in EC tissues. Then reporter gene analysis revealed that miR-302b post-transcriptionally regulated expression of target genes by specific area of 3â€²-UTR. Transfected by target genes shRNA plasmids together could get the same effects of miR-302b on protein expression of CRI key transcription factors. Furthermore, miR-302b was able to repress tumor growth and transcription factors protein expression
