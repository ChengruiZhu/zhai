When genetically different cell populations are mixed, there is competition between cells such that losing cells are eliminated from a tissue. Such cell elimination is also observed during normal development in genetically-homogeneous tissues. In addition to the identification of key genes and molecular mechanisms related to these phenomena, the relevance of cell/tissue mechanics has been reported as a possible common mechanism of elimination. Here, we examined these mechanisms and possible functions of mechanical cell elimination (MCE) from the perspective of tissue growth efficiency and homeostasis. Using mechanical simulations of tissue growth processes, we identified key parameters of cellular mechanical/growth properties that determine elimination rates or cellular fitness (defined as the difference between cell division and elimination rate). Based on these results, we propose mechanical feedback mechanisms that could improve tissue growth efficiency and density/stress homeostasis. Furthermore, when cells with different mechanical traits are mixed, we found that MCE could drive a drastic shift in cell trait distribution, thereby improving tissue growth efficiency through the selection of cellular traits. With this, cell density, stress state, and phenotype were also shown to become homogenous. Our results will permit the elucidation of the mechanisms of intrinsic tissue defense against abnormal cells by their elimination through mechanical cell-cell interactions.
