A 61-year-old male presented with a rare case of glioblastoma mimicking a cerebral contusion subsequent to collapsing. The patient had been medicated for hypertension for seven years and diabetes for eight years prior to hospitalization. Brain computed tomography (CT) revealed a cerebral contusion and intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) in the left temporal region. The patient was initially administered intravenous drugs to reduce the intracranial pressure following the diagnosis of a cerebral contusion. Serial CT revealed ICH resorption. However, the patient was again admitted due to a headache and vomiting two months later. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) demonstrated an enhanced ring-shaped mass around the cyst cavity within the left temporal region, with surrounding edema. The patient underwent cyst puncture drainage in the temporal region. No tumor cells were identified in the cyst fluid and the culture was also negative. The patient was admitted for a headache and vomiting for the third time one month after being discharged. A cyst, tumor and meningoencephalitis were suspected following an MRI scan. The patient was treated with a left temporal craniotomy for a mass resection and biopsy. The histological diagnosis of the biopsy specimen was that of a glioblastoma. Two months later, MRI revealed a recurrence of the glioblastoma. In the present case, a brain tumor should have initially been suspected as the cause of the ICH, despite the history of craniocerebral trauma and hypertension. Early awareness of this potential cause of ICH may facilitate a more prompt diagnosis and treatment.
