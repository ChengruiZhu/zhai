Cell migration is a complex, multifaceted process, triggered by chemotaxis and haptotatic responses from the extracellular matrix (ECM). It is triggered by a thin lamellipodium protrusion at the leading edge, followed by the assembly of a number of focal adhesions between the lamellipodium base and the ECM. Afterwards, actin stress fibers extend from nascent focal adhesions, some of which connect to the nucleus. In this work, we have developed a dynamic model of cell migration incorporating these four mechanisms of cell biology, such as remodeling of cell and nuclear membranes, focal adhesion dynamics, actin motor activity, and lamellipodia protrusion at the leading edge. We successfully compared our model with existing experimental works of cell migration on (1) substrates with various fibronectin coating concentrations, and (2) cell spreading on three patterned surfaces. Finally, our model demonstrates how actin stress fibers anchored at the trailing edge play a key role, leading to an increase in cell migration speed. Thereby, the model will not only provide new insights on better building such an experiment, but also further experiments will allow us to better validate the model.
