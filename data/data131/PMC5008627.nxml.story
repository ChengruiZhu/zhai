Sleep plays a pivotal role for the consolidation of memory. While REM sleep had originally been the focus of research due to its similarity with wakefulness, more recent studies suggest that different sleep stages are responsible for the consolidation of different types of memory. To better understand the changes in neuronal dynamics between the different sleep stages, neural mass models are a valuable tool, as they relate directly to the large-scale dynamics measured by an EEG. Here, we present a model of the sleeping thalamocortical system. We first show that the isolated thalamic submodule is able to generate different oscillatory behavior found in vivo. Furthermore, the full thalamocortical model reproduces the EEG of sleep stages N2 and N3 and preserves the temporal relationship between cortical K-complexes/slow oscillations and thalamic sleep spindles. A comparison with event related potential data from a recent sleep study in humans demonstrates its possible application in predicting the outcome of external stimulation on EEG rhythms. Our study shows, that a neural mass model incorporating few key mechanisms is sufficient to reproduce the complex brain dynamics observed during sleep.
