Increasingly dental surgeons face the challenge of reconstruction of the height and/or thickness of the alveolar ridge as more and more patients wish to have permanent restoration of their dental defects based on intraosseous implants. Evaluation of human allogeneic bone tissue grafts in reconstruction of atrophied alveolar ridge as a pre-implantation procedure. The material comprised 21 patients aged 19–63, treated between 2009 and 2012 by the same surgeon. Restoration of bone tissue defects was performed with allogeneic, frozen, radiation-sterilised, corticocancellous blocks. The study included 26 grafting procedures with 7 procedures consisting in reconstruction of the alveolar ridge in the mandible and 19 in the maxilla. In all the cases the atrophied alveolar ridge was successfully reconstructed, which allowed placement of intraosseous implants in compliance with the initial treatment plan. After the treatment was completed the patients reported for follow-up annually. The average time of follow-up amounted to 39 months (28–50 months). None of the implants was lost during the follow-up period. There was one case of gingival recession causing aesthetics deterioration of the prosthetic restoration. In three cases the connector became unscrewed partially, which was corrected at the same visit. Frozen, radiation-sterilised, allogeneic bone blocks constitute good and durable bone-replacement material allowing effective and long-lasting reconstruction of the atrophied alveolar ridge to support durable, implant-based, prosthetic restoration.
