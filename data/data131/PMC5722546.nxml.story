About 1 in 3 people suffer from bone and joint disease, which is a disease of bone and cartilage cells. Osteonecrosis of the femoral head (ONFH) is a typical example of bone and joint disease involving bone cell necrosis. Osteonecrosis of the femoral head leads to the occurrence of premature osteoarthritis of the hip and collapse of the cartilage cells, and there is currently no effective drug treatment available. In order to study the effects of “bone-strengthening pill” (BSP) on the repair of bone and cartilage cells, we investigated the potential effects of the herbal mixture BSP in an animal model of avascular necrosis of the femoral head and in patients. Results showed that 90% of rats injected with prednisone developed ONFH, whereas BSP administration prevented ONFH development in 70% of prednisone-injected rats. We evaluated the constituents of BSP by HPLC fingerprinting. We also evaluated the clinical efficacy of BSP in a double-blind, randomized, controlled trial of 300 patients with ONFH. The response rate was found to be higher in the treatment group than in the control group, with a response rate of 82% in the treatment group. Treatment with BSP also significantly reduced pain, improved hip function, reduced lameness, and improved pathology by X-ray and MRI analysis, compared with patients who did not receive BSP. These results suggest that BSP treatment inhibits and reverses necrosis of the femoral head bone cells and cartilage cells to repair the femoral head, promote the repair of bone and cartilage diseases.
