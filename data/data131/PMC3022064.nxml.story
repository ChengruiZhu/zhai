Liver ischemia and reperfusion-induced injury is a major clinical complication associated with hemorrhagic or endotoxin shock and thermal injury as well as liver transplantation and resectional surgery. Data obtained from several different studies suggest that an important initiating event in the pathophysiology of ischemia and reperfusion-induced tissue injury is enhanced production of superoxide concomitant with a decrease in the bioavailability of endothelial cell-derived nitric oxide. This review will summarize the evidence supporting the hypothesis that the redox imbalance induced by alterations in superoxide and nitric oxide generation creates a more oxidative environment within the different cells of the liver that enhances the nuclear transcription factor-ÎºB-dependent expression of a variety of different cytokines and mediators that may promote as well as limit ischemia and reperfusion-induced hepatocellular injury. In addition, the evidence implicating endothelial cell nitric oxide synthase-dependent and -independent generation of nitric oxide as important regulatory pathways that act to limit ischemia and reperfusion-induced liver injury and inflammation is also presented.
