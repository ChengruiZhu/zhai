Meiotic crossover events are not randomly distributed across the human genome, but are concentrated in many small regions of a few kb with high recombination rates compared to surrounding regions. How the distribution of recombination events affects the association of different alleles along the chromosome (linkage disequilibrium, or LD) was recently addressed using sperm typing in regions already known or suspected to contain unusually high recombination intensities. In the current paper, the authors used sperm typing to examine recombination in a region not known or suspected of containing recombination hot spots. They first established the crossover distribution pattern within a 103-kb region of human Chromosome 21. Then, they compared their data to predictions of crossover distributions estimated by statistical analyses of polymorphism in the region. They found a good concordance between the two, although it was not perfect. To the authors' knowledge, this work is the first to compare LD-based estimates of recombination to sperm-typing data from regions not previously known or suspected of containing recombination hot spots. In addition, one of the studied hot spots revealed an example of a decrease in recombination intensity with a concurrent increase at a nearby site. This unique observation suggests that the activity of hot spots may evolve in a concerted fashion such that the overall recombination activity of the region is maintained.
