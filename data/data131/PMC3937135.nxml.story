Maintaining genomic stability is important to prevent birth defects, genetic disorders and other diseases, including cancer. Double-strand DNA breaks (DSBs), which can result from exposure of living cells to ionizing radiation and various chemicals, threaten genomic integrity, thus making DSB repair essential. The choice of DSB repair pathway is important because some pathways confer destabilizing consequences. Break-induced replication (BIR) is a mechanism of DSB repair that is often associated with deleterious events that can threaten genetic stability. One such deleterious event is the formation of half-crossovers (HCs), which occurs when two chromosomes physically interacting during BIR repair fuse. Here we employed a yeast-based system to unravel the genetic factors promoting HC formation. We demonstrate that the interruption of BIR due to problems in DNA synthesis or checkpoint control, promote HCs. Additionally, we document that disruption of BIR promotes half-crossover-initiated cascades (HCC) that can significantly destabilize the genome and could be accounted as a potential mechanism responsible for cycles of non-reciprocal translocations contributing to cancer in humans.
