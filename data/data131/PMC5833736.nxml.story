Gallbladder cancer (GBC) is a malignant cancer with very poor prognosis. Although promyelocytic leukemia zinc-finger protein (PLZF) was reported to be deregulated in numerous cancers and also relevant to clinical prognosis, its role in GBC progression has been little known. In this study, we found PLZF expression was decreased in GBC, correlating to advanced TNM stage, distant metastasis, and shorter overall survival. Moreover, ectopic PLZF expression in GBC cells (NOZ and GBC-SD) significantly reduced the cell proliferation, migration, and invasion. Consistently, overexpression of PLZF in xenograft mice model could suppress tumor growth and liver metastasis. Mechanical investigations verified PLZF could regulate the expression of cell cycle arrest-associated gene p21 and epithelialâ€“mesenchymal transition (EMT)-related genes (E-cadherin and N-cadherin) in GBC cell lines. Importantly, PLZF remarkably increased the mRNA transcription of interferon-induced protein with tetratricopeptide repeat 2 (IFIT2) by increasing STAT1 protein level, a known factor involved in tumor progression. Furthermore, ablation of IFIT2 in PLZF overexpression cells abrogated the tumor-suppressive function of PLZF, at least partially, leading to impaired tumor growth and EMT program. These studies indicated PLZF inhibited the proliferation and metastasis via regulation of IFIT2. In conclusion, our study demonstrated PLZF could be a promising tumor biomarker for GBC, and also be a potential therapeutic target.
