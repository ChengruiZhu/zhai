 = 8) made saccades to the vertex of the oblique T-intersection between a diagonal pointer and a vertical line. Results showed both a small tendency to shift the saccade toward the interior of the angle, and a larger bias in the direction of a shorter saccade path to the landing line. In a different kind of task (visual extrapolation), the same subjects fixated the tip of a 45° pointer and made a saccade to the implicit point of intersection between pointer and a distant vertical line. Results showed large errors in the saccade landing positions and the saccade polar angle, in the direction predicted from the perceptual Poggendorff bias. Further experiments manipulated the position of the fixation point relative to the implicit target, such that the Poggendorff bias would be in the opposite direction from a bias toward taking the shortest path to the landing line. The bias was still significant. We conclude that the Poggendorff bias in eye movements is in part due to the mislocation of visible target features but also to biases in planning a saccade to a virtual target across a gap. The latter kind of error comprises both a tendency to take the shortest path to the landing line, and a perceptual error that overestimates the vector component orthogonal to the gap.
