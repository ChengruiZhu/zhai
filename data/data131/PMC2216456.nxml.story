Ouabain-sensitive K influx into ground squirrel and guinea pig red cells was measured at 5 and 37 degrees C as a function of external K and internal Na. In both species the external K affinity increases on cooling, being three- and fivefold higher in guinea pig and ground squirrel, respectively, at 5 than at 37 degrees C. Internal Na affinity also increased on cooling, by about the same extent. The effect of internal Na on ouabain-sensitive K influx in guinea pig cells fits a cubic Michaelis-Menten-type equation, but in ground squirrel cells this was true only at high [Na]i. There was still significant ouabain- sensitive K influx at low [Na]i. Ouabain-binding experiments indicated around 800 sites/cell for guinea pig and Columbian ground squirrel erythrocytes, and 280 sites/cell for thirteen-lined ground squirrel cells. There was no significant difference in ouabain bound per cell at 37 and 5 degrees C. Calculated turnover numbers for Columbian and thirteen-lined ground squirrel and guinea pig red cell sodium pumps at 37 degrees C were about equal, being 77-100 and 100-129 s-1, respectively. At 5 degrees C red cells from ground squirrels performed significantly better, the turnover numbers being 1.0-2.3 s-1 compared with 0.42-0.47 s-1 for erythrocytes of guinea pig. The results do not accord with a hypothesis that cold-sensitive Na pumps are blocked in one predominant form.
