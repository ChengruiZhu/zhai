Knowledgebases play an increasingly important role in scientific research, where the expert curation of biological knowledge in forms that are amenable to computational analysis (using ontologies for example)â€“provides a significant added value and enables new types of computational analyses for high throughput datasets. In this work, we demonstrate how expert curation can also play a more direct role in research, by supporting the use of network-based dynamical models to study a specific biological process. This curation effort is focused on the regulatory interactions between biological entities, such as genes or proteins and compounds, which may interact with each other in a complex manner, including regulatory complexes and conditional dependencies between co-regulators. This critical information has to be captured and encoded in a computable manner, which is currently far beyond the current capabilities of automatically constructed network. As a case study, we report here the prior knowledge network constructed by the sysVASC consortium to model the biological events leading to the formation of atherosclerotic plaques, during the onset of cardiovascular disease and discuss some specific examples to illustrate the main pitfalls and added value provided by the expert curation during this endeavor.
