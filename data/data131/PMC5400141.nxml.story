A total of 98 elite athletes with a mean follow up period of 18.8 months (±12.7) were identified. There were 49 females and 49 males. 27 athletes had bilateral hip arthroscopy, 5 of which had 1 operation elsewhere. All patients were available for follow up. Of the 80 patients desiring to return to their original competitive activity, 38 were female (42 hips) (Female Athlete group [FA]) and 42 were male (54 hips) (Male Athlete group [MA]) their mean ages were 21.5(±3.9) and 20.5(±1.9), duration of pain prior to surgery was 12.1 (±10.3) months and 15.1 (±1.9) months, respectively. 84.2% of FA and 83.3% of MA were able to return to the same level of competition at a mean of 8.3 (±3) and 8.8 (±2.9) months, respectively. Statistically significant improvements between pre- and post-operative mean MHHS and iHOT-33 scores were seen in both groups (p <.0001; p <.0001). FA had significantly higher proportions of hips that were diagnosed with Pincer type FAI (p =.0004), and Instability (p <.0001). Conversely, the MA had significantly higher proportions of hips that were diagnosed with Combined type FAI (p <.0001), had more extensive acetabular cartilage rim damage (p =.0002), and in particularly had more hips that required microfracture treatment (p =.001). When comparing cam lesions (includes Cam and Combined type FAI) the alpha angle was statistically greater in MA (mean 74°±6.7) compared to FA (mean 65.4°±6.8) (p <.0001). The category of sports the FA participated in were more flexibility (11%) and endurance (24%) type sports. MA participated more in cutting (33%), contact (14%) and asymmetric (31%) type sports. Patients who were able to return to same level of competitive activity had a significantly shorter duration of pre-operation symptoms compared to those who could not (p < 0.05). Microfracture treatment did not affect the ability to return to sports.
