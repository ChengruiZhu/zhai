Forty-one patients (22±8 y.o., 27 male / 14 female) underwent unilateral ACL-R. According to the maximum extension angle of the contralateral normal knee during gait using dynamic stereo X-ray (DSX) images, subjects were divided into 2 groups at the median value (4.7°): Hyperextension group (n = 21, knee extension: 7.8±2.2°), and Normal extension group (n = 20, knee extension: 2.4±2.0°). Six and twenty-four months after ACL-R, subjects performed level gait and downhill running on a treadmill while DSX images were acquired at 100Hz (gait) or 150Hz (running). Tibiofemoral motion was determined from DSX images using a previously validated model-based tracking process, and tibiofemoral translations/rotations from initial contact to initial loading (gait cycle: 0-10%) were calculated. The side-to-side differences (SSD) of range of tibiofemoral motions at 6 and 24 months after surgery were calculated. KT-1000 measurements and PRO (IKDC Subjective Knee Form and KOOS scores) at 24 months after surgery were also evaluated. Results of kinematics were analyzed using 2-way repeated-measures ANOVA, and the SSD of kinematics, KT-1000 measurements and PROs were analyzed using student t-test (
