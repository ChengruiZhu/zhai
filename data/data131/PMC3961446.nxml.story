 test and Cox regression analysis. The male to female ratio of the Chinese patients was 1:2.1 with the mean age of 44.2 years (range, 22–86 years). The percentage of asymptomatic Chinese patients was significantly higher than in the Western patients (40.0 vs. 24.8%; P=0.026), and that of extrahepatic metastasis (16.0 vs. 36.6%; P=0.005) was significantly lower in Chinese patients. On imaging study, capsular retraction (59.5%) and calcification (26.0%), as well as positivity of CD34 (93.5%) and CD31 (80.6%), were more frequently found in the Chinese patients. Management for the Chinese patients included liver resection (LRx; 45.7%), liver transplantation (LTx; 5.7%), trans-catheter arterial chemoembolization (14.3%) and palliative treatment (34.3%). Chinese patients with larger-sized tumor nodules [relative risk (RR), 1.58; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.032–2.422; P=0.035) and diffuse type (RR, 12.17; 95% CI, 1.595–92.979; P=0.016) exhibited unfavorable outcomes. In contrast to Western patients with HEHE, a larger number of Chinese patients were asymptomatic with less extrahepatic metastasis. In China, LRx is widely adopted rather than LTx. Chinese patients with large tumor size or diffuse type may encounter a poorer prognosis.
