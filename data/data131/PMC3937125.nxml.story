Gene expression is controlled by a complex network of regulatory interactions which may be organized in two complementary subnetworks: the transcriptional one, mediated by Transcription Factors (TF), and the post-transcriptional one, in which a central role is played by microRNAs. In this paper we add a further step in the study of synergistic role of these layers of regulation: a stable fine tuning of the relative expression of target genes is obtained by a combination of transcriptional and post-transcriptional interactions, and such a combination ensures robustness against stochastic fluctuations. We show that optimal fine tuning is reached when the microRNA plays the role of master regulator and one of its targets is a TF which regulates the other microRNA targets. This combination defines a new class of feed-forward loops. We show that such circuitries are strongly enriched when the TF and its targets have to be precisely kept at the same concentration notwithstanding the environmental noise. We complete our analysis with a detailed description, using both deterministic and stochastic equations, of the steady state concentrations of the genes involved in the motifs as a function of the miRNA concentration and of the miRNA-target interaction strength.
