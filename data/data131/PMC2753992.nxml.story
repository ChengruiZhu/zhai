Two meetings of the World Health Organization (WHO)—in 1999 and 2002—had examined the potential use of oral cholera vaccines (OCVs) as an additional public-health tool for the control of cholera. In the light of the work accomplished since 2002, WHO convened a third meeting to reexamine with a group of experts the role that OCVs might play in preventing potential outbreaks of cholera in crisis situations and to discuss the use of OCVs in endemic settings. The aim of the meeting was to agree a framework for the recommendations of WHO on these subjects and to consider the pertinence of further demonstration projects in endemic settings. The meeting addressed key issues, including currently-available vaccines, surveillance, and cholera-control measures in complex emergencies, and past experiences of using OCVs. More than 40 participants took part in the discussions, representing cholera-prone countries, humanitarian organizations, scientific institutions, United Nations agencies, and WHO. The experts agreed that when considering the use of OCVs in emergencies, a multidisciplinary approach is essential and that the prevention and control of cholera should be envisaged within the larger context of public-health priorities in times of crisis. As for the use of OCVs in endemic settings, all participants acknowledged that further data need to be collected before a clear definition of endemicity and potential vaccination strategies can be established. Results of further studies on the vaccines per se are also awaited. Recommendations relating to the use of OCVs (a) in complex emergencies and (b) in endemic settings were elaborated, and a decision-making tool for assessing the pertinence of use of OCVs in emergency settings was drafted. The document was finalized by an ad-hoc working group convened in Geneva on 1 March 2006 and is now available for field-testing. After testing, that should be carried out with the involvement of WHO and feedback from field partners, the decision-making tool will be adapted and disseminated.
