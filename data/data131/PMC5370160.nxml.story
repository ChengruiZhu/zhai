Calcium imaging methods enable simultaneous measurement of the activity of thousands of neighboring neurons, but come with major caveats: the slow decay of the fluorescence signal compared to the time course of the underlying neural activity, limitations in signal quality, and the large scale of the data all complicate the goal of efficiently extracting accurate estimates of neural activity from the observed video data. Further, current activity extraction methods are typically applied to imaging data after the experiment is complete. However, in many cases we would prefer to run closed-loop experiments—analyzing data on-the-fly to guide the next experimental steps or to control feedback—and this requires new methods for accurate real-time processing. Here we present a fast activity extraction algorithm addressing both issues. Our approach follows previous work in casting the activity extraction problem as a sparse nonnegative deconvolution problem. To solve this optimization problem, we introduce a new algorithm that is an order of magnitude faster than previous methods, and progresses through the data sequentially from beginning to end, thus enabling, in principle, real-time online estimation of neural activity during the imaging session. This computational advance thus opens the door to new closed-loop experiments.
