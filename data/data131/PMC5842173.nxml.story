Perivascular fat, the cushion of adipose tissue surrounding blood vessels, possesses dilator, anti-contractile and constrictor actions. The majority of these effects have been demonstrated in vitro and may depend on the vessel and/or the experimental method or species used. In general, the relaxant effect of perivascular adipose tissue is local and may be either endothelium-dependent or endothelium-independent. However, nerve stimulation studies show that, in general, perivascular adipose tissue (PVAT) has an anti-contractile vascular effect likely to involve an action of the autonomic vascular nerves. Apart from a direct effect of perivascular fat-derived factors on bypass conduits, an interaction with a number of neurotransmitters and other agents may play an important role in graft performance. Although the vascular effects of PVAT are now well-established there is a lack of information regarding the role and/or involvement of peripheral nerves including autonomic nerves. For example, are perivascular adipocytes innervated and does PVAT affect neuronal control of vessels used as grafts? To date there is a paucity of electrophysiological studies into nerve-perivascular fat control. This review provides an overview of the vascular actions of PVAT, focussing on its potential relevance on blood vessels used as bypass grafts. In particular, the anatomical relationship between the perivascular nerves and fat are considered and the role of the perivascular-nerve/fat axis in the performance of bypass grafts is also discussed.
