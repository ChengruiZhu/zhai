The DNA of all genomes is organized into chromosomes that are packaged in chromatin in which DNA is wrapped around nucleosomes composed of the histones H2A, H2B, H3, and H4. Centromeres are the specialized regions on chromosomes that attach them to spindle microtubules, and this process is required to allow each daughter cell to receive one copy of each chromosome after they have duplicated. Centromere regions are distinguished from other parts of the chromosome by the incorporation of the histone H3 variant CENP-A instead of histone H3 into specialized nucleosomes. This CENP-A chromatin allows the machinery (the kinetochore) responsible for attaching chromosomes to microtubules to assemble. Fission yeast centromeres contain a central domain where CENP-A is prevalent. This study shows that CENP-A can associate with “foreign” DNA placed in the central domain. Therefore, CENP-A appears to associate with any DNA placed in this environment, independent of its DNA sequence. Increasing the relative level of H3 allows H3 to be assembled in place of CENP-A in this critical central domain and results in defective centromere/kinetochore function and chromosome segregation. This study highlights the plasticity of centromeric chromatin.
