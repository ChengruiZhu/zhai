To better understand the effect of stress on nucleocytoplasmic trafficking, we exposed cells to the oxidant diethyl maleate. This treatment activated MEK→ERK1/2 as well as PI3 kinase→Akt cascades and triggered the inhibition of classical nuclear import. To define the molecular mechanisms that regulate nuclear transport, we examined whether MEK and PI3 kinase signaling affected the localization of key transport factors. Using recently developed tools for image acquisition and analysis, the subcellular distributions of importin-α, CAS, and nucleoporins Nup153 and Nup88 were quantified in different cellular compartments. These studies identified specific profiles for the localization of transport factors in the nucleus and cytoplasm, and at the nuclear envelope. Our results demonstrate that MEK and PI3 kinase signaling as well as oxidative stress control nuclear trafficking and the localization of transport components. Furthermore, stress not only induced changes in transport factor distribution, but also upregulated post-translational modification of transport factors. Our results are consistent with the idea that the phosphorylation of importin-α, CAS, Nup153, and Nup88, and the O-GlcNAc modification of Nup153 increase when cells are exposed to oxidant.
