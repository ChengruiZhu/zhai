The tumor suppressor gene p53 counteracts tumor growth by activating genes that prevent cell proliferation or induce cell death. How p53 selects genes in the genome to direct cell fate specifically into one or the other direction remains unclear. We show that the ability of p53 molecules to interact and thereby cooperate, influences which genes in the genome p53 is regulating. In the absence of cooperation, p53 only binds and regulates a limited ‘default’ set of genes that is proficient to stop cell proliferation but insufficient to induce cell death. Cooperation increases p53's DNA binding and enables context-dependent activation of apoptosis genes and repression of pro-survival genes which together triggers cell death. As the concerted effort of p53 molecules is needed, the threshold for cell killing is raised possibly to protect us from accidental cell loss. Thus, by shaping the genomic binding pattern, p53 cooperation fine-tunes the gene activity pattern to steer cell fate into the most appropriate, context-dependent direction. The genome-wide binding patterns of cooperating and non-cooperating p53 proteins generated in this study provide a comprehensive list of p53 binding sites as a resource for the scientific community to further explore mechanisms of tumor suppression by p53.
