Recent studies underscore the role of the microenvironment in therapy resistance of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) cells and leukemia progression. We previously showed that sustained mild activation of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress in CML cells supports their survival and resistance to chemotherapy. We now demonstrate, using dominant negative non-phosphorylable mutant of eukaryotic initiation factor 2 α subunit (eIF2α), that phosphorylation of eIF2α (eIF2α-P), which is a hallmark of ER stress in CML cells, substantially enhances their invasive potential and modifies their ability to secrete extracellular components, including the matrix-modifying enzymes cathepsins and matrix metalloproteinases. These changes are dependent on the induction of activating transcription factor-4 (ATF4) and facilitate extracellular matrix degradation by CML cells. Conditioned media from CML cells with constitutive activation of the eIF2α-P/ATF4 pathway induces invasiveness of bone marrow stromal fibroblasts, suggesting that eIF2α-P may be important for extracellular matrix remodeling and thus leukemia cells-stroma interactions. Our data show that activation of stress response in CML cells may contribute to the disruption of bone marrow niche components by cancer cells and in this way support CML progression.
