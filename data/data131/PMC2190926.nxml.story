T cell colonies were generated from the peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) of 10 patients with tropical spastic paraparesis/human T lymphocyte virus type I (HTLV-I)-associated myeloencephalopathy (TSP/HAM), two healthy HTLV-I carriers, and 17 healthy HTLV-I- seronegative subjects. PBMC were cultured in methylcellulose in the absence of added growth factors (spontaneous T cell colonies), or in the presence of phorbol myristate acetate and interleukin 2 (induced T cell colonies). PBMC T cell colony-forming cells (T-CFC) from all TSP/HAM patients and HTLV-I carriers were able to grow in the absence of added growth factors and/or mitogenic stimulation. Pooled spontaneous and induced colonies were composed of cells bearing CD3+, CD4+, CD8+, and CD1+ antigens. Colonies from normal HTLV-I-seronegative subjects displayed mature cells bearing the CD3+, CD4+, CD8+, and CD1- surface phenotype. In addition, spontaneous and induced T cell colonies expressed HTLV-I antigens in 18-38% of the cells from TSP/HAM patients and HTLV-I carriers. These results demonstrate that HTLV-I infection is associated with an abnormal proliferation and differentiation of T cell progenitors in vitro and that the T-CFC from HTLV-I-seropositive individuals are infected, suggesting that T-CFC abnormalities may play a predominant role in the pathophysiology of HTLV-I.
