Complex circuits of genes rather than a single gene underlie many important processes such as disease, development, and cellular damage repair. Although the wiring of many of these circuits has been mapped, how circuits operate in real time to carry out their functions is poorly understood. Here we address these questions by investigating the function of a gene circuit that responds to reactive oxygen species damage in archaea, microorganisms that represent the third domain of life. Members of this domain of life are excellent models for investigating the function and evolution of gene circuits. Components of archaeal regulatory machinery driving gene circuits resemble those of both bacteria and eukaryotes. Here we demonstrate that regulatory proteins of hybrid ancestry collaborate to control the expression of over 100 genes whose products repair cellular damage. Among these are other regulatory proteins, setting up a stepwise hierarchical circuit that controls damage repair. Regulation is dynamic, with gene targets showing immediate response to damage and restoring normal cellular functions soon thereafter. This study demonstrates how strong environmental forces such as stress may have shaped the wiring and dynamic function of gene circuits, raising important questions regarding how circuits originated over evolutionary time.
