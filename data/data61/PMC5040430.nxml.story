Diabetes is a disease reaching a global epidemic, which results from dysfunction to the islets of Langerhans in the pancreas and their ability to secrete the hormone insulin to regulate glucose homeostasis. Islets are multicellular structures that show extensive coupling between heterogeneous cellular units; and central to the causes of diabetes is a dysfunction to these cellular units and their interactions. Understanding the inter-relationship between structure and function is challenging in biological systems, but is crucial to the cause of disease and discovering therapeutic targets. With the goal of further characterizing the islet of Langerhans and its excitable behavior, we examined the role of important channels in the islet where dysfunction is linked to or causes diabetes. Advances in our ability to computationally model perturbations in physiological systems has allowed for the testing of hypothesis quickly, in systems that are not experimentally accessible. Using an experimentally validated model and modeling human mutations, we discover that monogenic forms of diabetes may be remedied by a reduction in electrical coupling between cells; either alone or in conjunction with pharmacological intervention. Knowledge of biological systems in general is also helped by these findings, in that small changes to cellular elements may lead to major disruptions in the overall system. This may then be overcome by allowing the system components to function independently in the presence of dysfunction to individual cells.
