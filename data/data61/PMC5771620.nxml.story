Circadian clocks in mammals rely on the heterodimeric transcription factor CLOCK:BMAL1 to drive rhythmic gene expression and allow biological functions to perform best at the most appropriate time of the day. Investigation of the mechanisms by which CLOCK:BMAL1 regulates its target genes transcription has led to the paradoxical observation that while CLOCK:BMAL1 DNA binding is rhythmic and occurs during the day for all target genes, its transcriptional output is highly heterogeneous. To address this issue, we analyzed independent genome-wide datasets and found that CLOCK:BMAL1 DNA binding during the day is associated with a reorganization of the chromatin that is favorable to transcription activation for all target genes. However, this diurnal CLOCK:BMAL1 DNA binding and chromatin remodeling is not sufficient to promote a transcriptionally active enhancer, therefore suggesting that CLOCK:BMAL1 cooperates with other factors to control the transcription of most of its target genes. This hypothesis is supported by our finding that ubiquitous transcription factors, but not tissue-specific transcription factors, are differentially recruited at CLOCK:BMAL1 enhancers. Altogether, our data highlight the critical role of transcription factors recruited at CLOCK:BMAL1 enhancers in regulating transcription, and present a new mechanistic framework to understand how changes in the environment can reprogram circadian transcriptional programs.
