Actin and myosin are key regulators of several processes that occur in the cell nucleus. In rRNA biogenesis, actin in complex with nuclear myosin 1c (NM1) is involved in several phases of rDNA transcription. Further, NM1 interacts with the chromatin remodelling complex WICH, with the subunits WSTF and SNF2h. The multiprotein assembly thus formed, termed B-WICH, is engaged in the post-initiation phase of pol I transcription. These observations have led to the proposal that the actin-NM1 interaction mediates the recruitment of the WICH complex to activate transcription. Recent evidence indicates that the WSTF component of the B-WICH complex facilitates SNF2h-dependent nucleosomes repositioning and remodels in this way the chromatin at the rRNA gene promoter. We show here that NM1 interacts with the WICH complex and that this interaction is required to establish permissive chromatin by promoting H3K9 acetylation. This mechanism leads to transcription activation and facilitates cell cycle progression. NM1 performs these actions by interacting with SNF2h, presumably stabilizing B-WICH at the gene promoter. We show also that NM1 is needed for association of the polymerase-associated actin with the rRNA gene. Actin and SNF2h compete for NM1 binding. Therefore we propose a two-step mechanism of gene activation where NM1 functions as a structural switch that connects pol I with chromatin for transcription activation and cell cycle progression.
