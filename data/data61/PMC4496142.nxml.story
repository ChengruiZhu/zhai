 (polycystic kidney and hepatic disease 1), the autosomal recessive polycystic kidney disease (ARPKD) gene, encodes a single-pass, integral membrane protein named polyductin or fibrocystin. A fusion protein comprising its intracellular C-terminus, FP2, was previously used to raise a polyclonal antiserum shown to detect polyductin in several human tissues, including liver. In the current study, we aimed to investigate by immunohistochemistry the detailed polyductin localization pattern in normal (ductal plate [DP], remodelling ductal plate [RDP], remodelled bile ducts) and abnormal development of the primitive intrahepatic biliary system, known as ductal plate malformation (DPM). This work also included the characterization of polyductin expression profile in various histological forms of neonatal and infantile cholestasis, and in cholangiocellular carcinoma (CCC) and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). We detected polyductin expression in the intrahepatic biliary system during the DP and the RDP stages as well as in DPM. No specific staining was found at the stage of remodelled bile ducts. Polyductin was also detected in liver biopsies with neonatal cholestasis, including mainly biliary atresia and neonatal hepatitis with ductular reaction as well as congenital hepatic fibrosis. In addition, polyductin was present in CCC, whereas it was absent in HCC. Polyductin was also co-localized in some DP cells together with oval stem cell markers. These results represent the first systematic study of polyductin expression in human pathologies associated with abnormal development of intrahepatic biliary tree, and support the following conclusions: (i) polyductin expression mirrors developmental properties of the primitive intrahepatic biliary system; (ii) polyductin is re-expressed in pathological conditions associated with DPM and (iii) polyductin might be a potential marker to distinguish CCC from HCC.
