Protein biosynthesis (translation) is a highly regulated process in gene expression. In all organisms, initiation of translation depends on molecular recognition of the messenger RNA by ribosomes. In prokaryotes (bacteria, mitochondria, and chloroplasts), this recognition is mediated by a specific sequence motif in the 5′ untranslated region of the mRNA, called “ribosome-binding site” or “Shine-Dalgarno sequence.” However, many messenger RNAs lack Shine-Dalgarno sequences, and it is currently unknown how the correct translation initiation site is recognized in these mRNAs. Here, we provide insights into the mechanism of translation initiation in the absence of a ribosome-binding site. We have performed genome-wide searches for Shine-Dalgarno–independent translation in bacterial and organellar genomes and report that a large fraction of transcripts is translated in a Shine-Dalgarno–independent manner in all prokaryotic systems. We find that Shine-Dalgarno–independent translation initiation is strongly correlated with the presence of a local minimum in RNA secondary structure around the translational start codon. The significance of RNA unfoldedness as the key determinant of start codon recognition in Shine-Dalgarno–independent translation initiation was confirmed experimentally by employing reporter gene fusions in the bacterium
