The antigenic relationship between human neuronal and lymphocyte cell surface antigens has been analyzed using heteroantisera raised against human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC). The specificities of the crossreactive antigens were examined by immunoprecipitation of 125I- labeled SK-N-SH cultured neuronal cells using rabbit anti-PBMC (RAPBMC) sera and compared to known specificities using mAb. The predominant reactivity of each rabbit antiserum tested against SK-N-SH cells was with three molecules of 130,000, 160,000, and 180,000 Mr. These three chains comigrated with three molecules precipitated with the very late activation antigen (VLA)-specific mAb A-1A5. Sequential precipitations with mAb A-1A5 established that the three RAPBMC-precipitated bands were members of the VLA complex. This was confirmed by two-dimensional PAGE of the RAPBMC and A-1A5 immunoprecipitates, which were indistinguishable from one another. The two-dimensional pattern was more complex than was anticipated from the heterodimeric model of VLA chain association, and suggests an additional 130,000 Mr component of VLA. The three chains of the VLA complex precipitated by RAPBMC or mAb A-1A5 from SK-N-SH neurons closely resembled the VLA pattern present on activated T cells, including the 180,000 Mr activation-specific alpha 1 chain recognized by mAb TS2/7. Normal brain cell membranes also contain VLA molecules that are precipitated by RAPBMC and mAb A-1A5. Thus the VLA complex provides potentially important shared immunogens on human neurons and T cells.
