For the control group, the average age was 36 years (range 18-50 years) with 71 males and 51 females. The average improvement of the study group was 23 points (preop 69; postop 92) and, for the control group, 21 points (preop 63; postop 84). For the study group, FAI correction was performed for 36 cam, 17 pincer, and 69 combined lesions. 111 labral tears underwent 85 refixations and 26 debridements. There were 101 acetabular chondral lesions (42 Grade I, 18 Grade II, 47 Grade III and 4 Grade IV) with 4 microfractures. There were 3 femoral chondral lesions (1 Grade II, 2 Grade III). 7 loose bodies were removed and 19 lesions of the ligamentum teres were debrided. Concomitant extraarticular procedures included 13 iliopsoas tendon releases and 2 iliotibial band tendoplasties. Among the control group, FAI correction was performed for 53 cam, 5 pincer and 64 combined lesions. 103 labral tears underwent 52 refixations and 50 debridements. There were 112 acetabular chondral lesions (9 Grade I, 11 Grade II, 59 Grade III, 33 Grade IV) with 20 microfractures. There were 17 femoral chondral lesions (1 Grade II, 11 Grade III, 5 Grade IV). 17 loose bodies were removed and 21 lesions of the ligamentum teres debrided. Concomitant extraarticular procedures included 4 iliopsoas tendon releases and 1 abductor repair. There were 2 complications in the study group: transient perineal neurapraxias that resolved within 2 weeks.
