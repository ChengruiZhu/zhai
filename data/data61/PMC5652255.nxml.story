Docking protein 2 (Dok2) and Ras p21 protein activator 1 (RASA1) are tumor suppressors which have been identified in numerous solid tumors; however, the association between their expression in breast cancer and patient prognosis remains unclear. A total of 285 consecutive patients diagnosed histopathologically with breast cancer who underwent surgery at Jingzhou Central Hospital were selected for the present study. Dok2 and RASA1 protein were explored using histopathology and western blotting techniques, and the association of patient prognosis with clinicopathological parameters was investigated using univariate and multivariate analyses. Weak expression of Dok2/RASA1 was associated with poorly differentiated breast adenocarcinomas; negatively expressed Dok2 and RASA1 were associated with increased tumor size, a higher proportion of axillary lymph node metastasis and later clinical staging. Additionally, Dok2 and RASA1 expression were associated with disease-free survival of patients with breast cancer. As indicated by Cox's regression analysis, Dok2 and RASA1 expression and the high proportion of axillary lymph node metastasis served as significant independent predictors for the recurrence of breast cancer. The results of the present study suggested that combined Dok2 and RASA1 negative expression may serve as an independent prognostic factor for patients following breast cancer surgery.
