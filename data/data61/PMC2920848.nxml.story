Mitochondria play a crucial role in metabolic homeostasis, and alteration of mitochondrial function is a hallmark of diabetes. While mitochondrial activity is reduced in people with diabetes, it is unclear whether mitochondrial dysfunction is a cause or effect of type 2 diabetes. Genome-wide association studies for type 2 diabetes have explained â‰ˆ10% of the heritability of the disease, but none of the loci are known to affect mitochondrial activity. It is possible though that a mitochondrial contribution is hidden in the remaining 90%. Hence, we tested the hypothesis that multiple mitochondria-related genes encoded in the nucleus, each having a weak effect (hard to detect individually), can collectively influence type 2 diabetes. To address this, we developed a computational method (MAGENTA) that allowed us to adequately analyze large collective datasets of human genetic variation obtained from collaborative studies of type 2 diabetes and related glycemic traits. Despite the increased sensitivity of MAGENTA compared to single-DNA variant analysis, we found no support for a causal relationship between mitochondrial dysfunction and type 2 diabetes. These results may help steer future efforts in understanding the pathogenesis of the disease. MAGENTA is broadly applicable to testing associations between other biological pathways and common diseases or traits.
