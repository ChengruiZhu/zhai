‘Gesundes Kinzigtal’ is one of the few population-based integrated care approaches in Germany, organising care across all health service sectors and indications. The system is run by a regional health management company (Gesundes Kinzigtal GmbH) in cooperation with the regional physicians' network and with two statutory health insurers (among them is the biggest health insurer in Southwest Germany: AOK Baden-Württemberg). Membership is optional for insured persons in the Kinzigtal area. The management company and its partners maintain to reach a higher quality of organisational, coordination and interaction processes (among the concerned physicians, therapists, pharmacists, hospitals, patients and health insurers) at a lower overall cost as compared with the German standard. During its first two years of operation (2006–2007), the Kinzigtal project actually achieved positive financial results as compared with its reference value. To gain independent evidence on the quality aspects of the system, the management company and the two cooperating health insurers provided a remarkable budget for the evaluation of the system by independent scientific institutions. Since 2006–2007 several evaluation projects have started, investigating different quality aspects of the Kinzigtal system. In our presentation we will outline the overall evaluation concept and report some preliminary results.
