Although they represent a valuable alternative to heated			 humidifiers, artificial noses have unfavourable mechanical effects. Most			 important of these is the increase in dead space, with consequent increase in			 the ventilation requirement. Also, artificial noses increase the inspiratory			 and expiratory resistance of the apparatus, and may mildly increase intrinsic			 positive end-expiratory pressure. The significance of these effects depends on			 the design and function of the artificial nose. The pure humidifying function			 results in just a moderate increase in dead space and resistance of the			 apparatus, whereas the combination of a filtering function with the humidifying			 function may critically increase the volume and the resistance of the			 artificial nose, especially when a mechanical filter is used. The increase in			 the inspiratory load of ventilation that is imposed by artificial noses, which			 is particularly significant for the combined heat-moisture exchanger filters,			 should be compensated for by an increase either in ventilator output or in			 patient's work of breathing. Although both approaches can be tolerated by			 most patients, some exceptions should be considered. The increased pressure and			 volume that are required to compensate for the artificial nose application			 increase the risk of barotrauma and volutrauma in those patients who have the			 most severe alterations in respiratory mechanics. Moreover, those patients who			 have very limited respiratory reserve may not be able to compensate for the			 inspiratory work imposed by an artificial nose. When we choose an artificial			 nose, we should take into account the volume and resistance of the available			 devices. We should also consider the mechanical effects of the artificial noses			 when setting mechanical ventilation and when assessing a patient's			 ability to breathe spontaneously.
