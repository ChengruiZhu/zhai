 1. No evidence has been obtained that in cats and dogs with the nerves of one adrenal cut, emotional disturbances cause depletion of the epinephrin store of the normally innervated adrenal as compared with its fellow. 2. The depletion of the epinephrin store in cats under morphine is not dependent upon so called morphine fright, since a similar depletion is found in dogs in which, as is known, morphine produces symptoms the reverse of those of fright. 3. The signs of morphine fright can all be elicited by administering morphine to a cat in which one adrenal has been removed and the nerve supply of the other cut, and in which accordingly no detectable liberation of epinephrin takes place. 4. The reactions of the denervated iris elicited by emotional disturbance, asphyxia, or etherization in a cat, one of whose adrenals has been removed and the nerves of the other cut, do not differ from these reactions in cats whose adrenals have not been interfered with. 5. The influence of postoperative edema of the adrenal in diminishing the epinephrin load, and the recuperation of the load after a time, have been studied in rabbits. 6. The diminution in the epinephrin store of the adrenals which follows operations on animals (postoperative depletion) has been studied. It is only in part associated with the anesthesia, since it may be as marked 6 or 8 hours after an operation lasting less than 1 hour as after 6 or 8 hours' anesthesia without operation. 7. One adrenal was removed in rabbits and the epinephrin content of the remaining gland assayed at varying periods of time after removal of the first, the periods being longer than the time necessary for recovery from the postoperative depletion. In general, the second adrenal contained more epinephrin than the first, sometimes double the amount. 8. Marked depletion of the epinephrin store of innervated adrenals as compared with the corresponding denervated glands was seen in animals dead of infections of various kinds. 9. As shown by Elliott, diminution of the stock of epinephrin in the adrenal through electrical stimulation of the splanchnics is not easy to demonstrate, despite the fact that the liberation of epinephrin into the blood is notably increased by the stimulation. With short periods of stimulation, however, repeated over a long time at intervals just long enough to prevent fatigue, it has proved possible to demonstrate a distinct depletion.
