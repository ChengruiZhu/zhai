The present study describes a case of a solitary fibrous tumor (SFT) concurrent with meningioma in the same anatomical region. The patient was admitted to Tianjin Huanhu Hospital (Tianjin, China) presenting with progressive eyesight impairment, dizziness and right hemiparesis. Cranial magnetic resonance imaging revealed two primary tumors co-occurring at the same site. One lesion was a solid lesion located in the left frontal convex with homogeneous enhancement, and was closely associated with the dura mater; thus, it was suspected that the lesion was a meningioma. The second lesion was cystic and solid with an irregular shape, and was located next to the first tumor; this lesion was believed to be a hemangiopericytoma or astrocytoma. The patient underwent a left temporoparietal craniectomy and a complete excision of the two tumors was achieved. Subsequent pathological examination of the resected tissues confirmed that the two tumors were a secretory meningioma and a SFT, respectively. Immunohistochemistry is important in differentiating SFTs from other tumors. Currently, a total tumor resection is the optimal treatment strategy when managing these rare lesions, often with no requirement for adjuvant post-operative therapy; however, long-term follow-up is essential to detect any signs of recurrence. The possibility of multiple tumors should be taken into consideration when performing clinical examination. To further understand the mechanisms underlying the occurrence of multiple intracranial tumors, further research is required, alongside an increased number of case reports.
