This study aimed to evaluate the prognostic significance of node ratio (Nr), the ratio of metastatic to retrieved lymph nodes, and to investigate whether a modified staging system based on Nr can improve prognostic ability for gastric cancer patients following gastrectomy. A total of 2572 patients were randomly divided into training set and validation set, and the cutoff points for Nr were produced using X-tile. The relationships between Nr and other clinicopathologic factors were analyzed, while survival prognostic discriminatory ability and accuracy were compared among different staging systems by AIC and C-index in R program. Patients were categorized into four groups as follows: Nr0, Nr1: 0.00–0.15, Nr2: 0.15–0.40 and Nr3: > 0.40. Nr was significantly associated with clinicopathologic factors including macroscopic type, tumor differentiation, lymphovascular invasion, perineural invasion, tumor size, T stage, N stage and TNM stage. Besides, for all patients, Nr and TNrM staging system showed a smaller AIC and a larger C-index than that of N and TNM staging system, respectively. Moreover, in subgroup analysis for patients with retrieved lymph nodes < 15, Nr was demonstrated to have a smaller AIC and a larger C-index than N staging system. Furthermore, in validation analysis, Nr, categorized by our cutoff points, showed a larger C-index and a smaller AIC value than those produced in previous studies. Nr could be considered as a reliable prognostic factor, even in patients with insufficient (< 15) retrieved lymph nodes, and TNrM staging system may improve the prognostic discriminatory ability and accuracy for gastric cancer patients undergoing radical gastrectomy.
