Eight cadaveric shoulders were dissected to expose the intact capsule and glenohumeral joint. The set-up and testing was as described by Itoi ,Sekiya and Yamamoto1,2,3.The humeral shaft and scapula were potted and the shoulder mounted on a custom shoulder testing device permitting 6 degrees of freedom. The test positions were 60 degrees of glenohumeral abduction and 60 degrees of external rotation. A 50N compressive load was applied to the glenohumeral joint. A MTS 858 Servohydraulic test system (MTS Systems, Eden Prairie, MN) was used to translate the humeral head anteriorly 10mm at a rate of 2.0mm/sec. The peak force required to translate the humeral head 10mm was recorded. Three trials were performed in each condition, and the mean value was used for data analysis. All Bankart lesions were made sharply from the 2 o’clock to 6 o’clock position for a right shoulder. Bankart repair was made with transosseous tunnels using high strength suture. A digital micrometer was used to measure and create glenoid defects with a saw parallel to the anterior glenoid. Hill-Sachs lesions were made from 3D models created from a clinical database of computerized tomographic images of 142 patients with shoulder instability (Figure 1). A bell-shape curve was created and the 50th percentile lesion for size and location was selected, 1.47 cm3. Testing was conducted in the following sequence for each specimen:(1) intact (2)posterior capsulotomy, (3)bankart lesion, (4)bankart repair, (5) 2mm glenoid defect with Bankart lesion, (6)bankart repair, (3) Hill Sachs (1.47cm3) lesion, bankart lesion and 2mm defect, (7)bankart repair, (8) 4mm defect with Hill Sachs defect and Bankart lesion,(9)bankart repair, (10)6mm glenoid defect with Hill Sachs, defect and Bankart lesion (11)bankart repair.
