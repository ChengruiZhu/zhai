Molecule targeting therapy using somatostatin (SS) analogues has become a widely accepted modality to treat neuroendocrine tumors (NETs), particularly gastrointestinal (GI) and pancreatic endocrine tumors. On the other hand, little is known about the expression of somatostatin receptor (SSTR) subtypes in neuroendocrine carcinomas (NECs). We investigated the expression of SSTR subtypes (SSTR-1, 2A, 3, 4 and 5) using real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) method and immunohistochemistry in 32 neuroendocrine neoplasms (9 NET G1, 2 NET G2, 18 NECs G3 and 3 mixed NEC G3) of various primary sites. Expression of more than two SSTR subtypes was detected in all neuroendocrine neoplasms examined. Expression of SSTR-2A mRNA was significantly higher than other subtypes. In addition, mRNA expression of SSTR-3 and SSTR-5 was significantly low or below the detection level except for gastroduodenal NET G1. No significant difference of the expression of SSTR subtypes was observed between the NET and NEC groups. The expression of protein and mRNA was generally well correlated. In conclusion, NECs would be a good candidate for molecule targeting therapy using SS analogues, and the expression of SSTR-2A can be useful as a biomarker of neuroendocrine differentiation. We have demonstrated that NEC G3 small cell type shows a different expression profile of SSTR subtypes compared with NET and NEC non-small cell type.
