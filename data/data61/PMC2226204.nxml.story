Renal Na-K-ATPase activity changes adaptively in response to chronic alterations in sodium reabsorption or potassium secretion, but the role of this enzyme in rapid adjustments of renal tubular Na and K transport is not known. To evaluate this question, microsomal Na-K-ATPase specific activity and kinetics were determined in the rat and guinea pig kidney after massive but short-term (3 h) sodium or potassium loading. In other experiments renal sodium handling was evaluated in hydropenic and saline-loaded rats in which enzyme synthesis was prevented by the concurrent administration of actinomycin D or cycloheximide. Saline loading increased net sodium reabsorption in both rats and guinea pigs, but microsomal Na-K-ATPase from the outer medulla (where the reabsorptive increment is greatest) did not change significantly in either species. In vitro [3H]ouabain bidint to guinea pig microsomes and apparent Km for sodium of rat microsomal Na-K- ATPase, both from outer medulla, were also unaltered. Actinomycin D and cycloheximide failed to increase sodium excretion and microsomal Na-K- ATPase remained unchanged. KCL loading resulted in a 10-fold increase in K excretion but again Na-K-ATPase specific activity (in cortex, outer medulla, and papilla), and its apparent Km for potassium were not affected. Taken together these results suggest that rapid adjustments in remal tubular Na or K transport are mediated by mechanisms that do not involve the Na-K-ATPase enzyme system.
