In the previous studies, the several halocarbons (HC) were tested as promoters for a Ti-based Zieglerâ€“Natta (ZN) catalyst at different polymerization conditions. The Results showed that chloro cyclohexane has the best operation in catalyst activity, polymer particle size growth, hydrogen responsibility and wax reduction too. For the first time in this study, the effect of Al/Ti ratio on the optimum HC/Ti ratio has been considered and the results showed that the optimum HC/Ti ratio depends on the Al/Ti ratio directly. In the optimum HC/Ti ratio, the catalyst activity and hydrogen responsibility ratio of the catalyst increase up to 125 and 55% respectively. The acceptable growth of polymer powder up to 46%, lower flow rate ratio (FRR) up to 19% and decrease of wax amount up to 12%, completed the promotion results. Furthermore, in the next part of this study and as key note, a little dose of halocarbon was used in the catalyst preparation to produce the special catalysts with dual active sites. In the catalyst preparation, the concentration of each active sites depends on the halocarbon amount and it can control the molecular weight distribution of the produced polyethylene; because each active sites have different response to hydrogen. The halocarbon based catalysts showed the remarkable effect on the catalyst activity, the molecular weight and especially molecular weight distribution (MWD). The flow rate ratio and MWD could be increased up to 77 and 88% respectively as the main result of halocarbon addition during the catalyst preparation.
