The ability of cells to respond to chemical signals present in the environment is of upmost importance for life. In the developing embryo, cells crawl along graded fields of chemical cues to aggregate into organized patterns. This process is an example of chemotaxis. It is a complex phenomenon, where external signals are transduced into internal chemical pathways leading to directional movement. Differential reorganization of the internal structure is called polarization, and it involves regulatory proteins as well as cytoskeletal elements. In this work, we propose a mathematical and computational model for the quantitative study of chemotactic pathfinding in neural cells. Our starting point is the recent finding that, for such cells, an early polarization event is the redistribution on the membrane of cueâ€“ligated receptors, transported by the cytoskeletal structures, which act as a sort of conveyor belt. We show that this proposed mechanism, connecting in a closed loop cue sensing and cytoskeleton dynamics, is qualitatively and quantitatively adequate to produce polarization. We also investigate the role of the internal biochemical chain in producing signal amplification and its tight interlacing with polarization. An extension of the model is used to study chemotactic behaviors as the attractive/repulsive response of axons exposed to the same cue.
