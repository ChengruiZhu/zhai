A 60-year-old male patient presented with complaints of persistent red to a brown-colored plaque on his scrotum, with duration of approximately three years. The patient had been treated with oral and topical antifungals for inguinal tinea for several months and after that with topical corticosteroids for eczema for several more months. None of the regimens achieved any therapeutic effect. The histopathological evaluation revealed the presence of atypical keratinocytes in all layers of the epidermis with the altered epidermal pattern, spread parabasal mitotic activity, without secondary satellites, multiple dyskeratotic cells and multinucleated cells. The diagnosis of an intraepithelial non-invasive squamous cell carcinoma, associated with koilocytic dysplasia and hyperplasia was made, meeting the criteria for Bowen disease. An elliptic surgical excision of the lesion was made, while the defect was closed with single stitches, with excellent therapeutic and aesthetic result. First described by John T. Bowen in 1912, Bowen disease (BD) represents a squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) in situ with the potential for significant lateral spread. Treatment options include the application of topical 5-flurorouracil cream â€“ useful in non-hairy areas, imiquimod cream or destructive methods such as radiation, curettage, cryotherapy, laser ablation and photodynamic therapy, especially useful in nail bed involvement. Despite the early lesions, surgical excision is the preferred treatment option, regarding the potential malignant transformation risk.
