Seven years of experience in compensator intensity‐modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) clinical implementation are presented. An inverse planning dose optimization algorithm was used to generate intensity modulation maps, which were delivered via either the compensator or segmental multileaf collimator (MLC) IMRT techniques. The in‐house developed compensator‐IMRT technique is presented with the focus on several design issues. The dosimetry of the delivery techniques was analyzed for several clinical cases. The treatment time for both delivery techniques on Siemens accelerators was retrospectively analyzed based on the electronic treatment record in LANTIS for 95 patients. We found that the compensator technique consistently took noticeably less time for treatment of equal numbers of fields compared to the segmental technique. The typical time needed to fabricate a compensator was 13 min, 3 min of which was manual processing. More than 80% of the approximately 700 compensators evaluated had a maximum deviation of less than 5% from the calculation in intensity profile. Seventy‐two percent of the patient treatment dosimetry measurements for 340 patients have an error of no more than 5%. The pros and cons of different IMRT compensator materials are also discussed. Our experience shows that the compensator‐IMRT technique offers robustness, excellent intensity modulation resolution, high treatment delivery efficiency, simple fabrication and quality assurance (QA) procedures, and the flexibility to be used in any teletherapy unit.
