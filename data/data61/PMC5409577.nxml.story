Previous studies found that hypertension and high homocysteine (HHcy) exhibited a synergistic effect on the risk of cardiovascular diseases. This study aimed to investigate the prevalence of hypertension accompanied by HHcy and its risk factors in the rural areas of northeast China. This study was conducted using a stratified cluster random sampling method, and included 6529 subjects with complete data. Demographic characteristics were obtained from a questionnaire. Blood pressure and anthropometric indices were measured, and serum indices were analyzed. Hypertension accompanied by HHcy was defined as hypertension plus HHcy [homocysteine (Hcy) > 10 µmol/L]. The mean concentration of Hcy was 17.29 μmol/L in the general population. The prevalence of hypertension accompanied by HHcy was so high that it reached 45.1% of our study population and accounted for 86.8% of the total participants with hypertension. Multiple logistic regression analysis indicated that the modifiable risk factors of hypertension accompanied by HHcy included obesity, diabetes, dyslipidemia, and inactive physical activities. We found that the mean level of Hcy, and the prevalences of HHcy and hypertension accompanied by HHcy were very high among the rural population of northeast China. Obesity, diabetes, dyslipidemia, and inactive physical activities were modifiable risk factors of hypertension accompanied by HHcy.
