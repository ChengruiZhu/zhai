Gut-derived bacterial products contribute to liver inflammation and injury during chronic hepatitis B virus infection; however, the underlying mechanisms remain obscure. In this study, hepatitis B surface antigen transgenic (HBs-Tg) mice and their wild-type (WT) control C57BL/6 mice were injected with CpG-oligodeoxynucleotides (ODNs) to mimic the translocation of gut microbial products into the systemic circulation. We found that, compared with the WT mice, the HBs-Tg mice were oversensitive to CpG-ODN-induced liver injury, which was dependent on natural killer T (NKT) cells. CpG-ODN injection enhanced the expression of Fas ligand (FasL) on NKT cells. In addition, hepatocytes from the HBs-Tg mice expressed higher levels of Fas than did those from the WT mice, which was further augmented by CpG-ODN. Interaction of Fas and FasL was involved in the cytotoxicity of NKT cells against hepatocytes in the HBs-Tg mice. Moreover, Kupffer cells in the HBs-Tg mice expressed higher levels of CD205 and produced greater amounts of interleukin (IL)-12 than did those in the WT mice. Finally, the depletion of Kupffer cells, neutralization of IL-12 or specific silencing of CD205 on Kupffer cells significantly inhibited CpG-ODN-induced liver injury and NKT activation in the HBs-Tg mice. Our data suggest that CD205-expressing Kupffer cells respond to CpG-ODNs and subsequently release IL-12 to promote NKT cell activation. Activated NKT cells induce liver damage through the Fas signaling pathway in HBs-Tg mice.
