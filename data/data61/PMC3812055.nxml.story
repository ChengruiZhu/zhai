The brain mediates behavior by orchestrating the activity of billions of neurons that communicate with each other through electric impulses. The transmission of these action potentials is surprisingly slow for a large fraction of these connections. Given the importance of precise timing of neuronal activity, the function of these slow connections has remained a puzzle. We here used computer simulations to investigate how slow connection speeds alter the overall activity patterns of two brain networks. We found that these connections enable the interconnected networks to generate distinct activity patterns such as different types of waves of electric activity. Our results therefore suggest that the slow transmission of electric impulses in the brain is not a “design flaw” but rather plays an important role in enabling the brain to generate a richer set of activity patterns. The ability of the brain to switch between different activity states is crucial to normal cognition, and abnormalities in switching behavior are associated with cognitive symptoms in psychiatric disorders such as schizophrenia and autism. It is therefore promising that we were able to control transitions between different activity states with non-invasive brain stimulation in our simulations, suggesting a novel approach to the treatment of these illnesses.
