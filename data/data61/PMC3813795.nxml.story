, to determine whether this expression was affected during tumor growth in a murine melanoma model and to correlate Foxp3 expression with CD25 expression, interleukin (IL)-2 production and tumor weight. Foxp3 expression was analyzed with quantitative (q)PCR, flow cytometry and confocal microscopy. CD25 expression was analyzed by flow cytometry, and cytokine production was measured by ELISA [IL-2, interferon (IFN)-γ, transforming growth factor (TGF)-β and IL-10] and flow cytometry (IL-2, IFN-γ, IL-4 and IL-5). Foxp3 and CD25 expression was detected in the B16F10 cells in culture and in the intratumoral B16F10 cells. An increase in Foxp3 and CD25 expression was observed in a time-dependent manner during tumor growth at 7, 14 and 21 days. The production of the IL-2, IL-10, IFN-γ and TGF-β cytokines was observed in the B16F10 cells and also detected in the tumoral microenvironment during tumor growth (7, 14 and 21 days). An increase in IL-2 and IL-10 production was observed, whereas IFN-γ production decreased in a time-dependent manner. The production of tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α was not observed in culture, but was detected during tumor growth, whereas the production of IL-4 and IL-5 was not detected. These data showed a positive correlation between the expression of Foxp3, CD25 and IL-2 and tumor weight in murine melanoma. From these data, it may be suggested that Foxp3 participates in melanoma growth, the modulation of the IL-2, IFN-γ and TNF-α cytokines and CD25 expression, and that it also plays a possible role in immunosuppression.
