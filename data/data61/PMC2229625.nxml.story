 mechanosensitive ion channels Ec-MscS and Ec-MscL, pass currents of 125–300 pA. To resolve temporal details of conductance transitions, a patch-clamp setup was optimized for low-noise recordings at a time resolution of 3 μs (10–20 times faster than usual). Analyses of the high-resolution recordings confirm that Ec-MscL visits many subconductance states and show that most of the intersubstate transitions occur more slowly than the effective resolution of 3 μs. There is a clear trend toward longer transition times for the larger transitions. In Ec-MscS recordings, the majority of the observed full conductance transitions are also composite. We detected a short-lived (∼20 μs) Ec-MscS substate at 2/3 of full conductance; transitions between 2/3 and full conductance did not show fine structure and had a time course limited by the achieved resolution. Opening and closing transitions in MscS are symmetrical and are not preceded or followed by smaller, rapid currents (“anticipations” or “regrets”). Compared with other, lower-conductance channels, these measurements may detect unusually early states in the transitions from fully closed to fully open. Increased temporal resolution at the single-molecule level reveals that some elementary steps of structural transitions are composite and follow several alternative pathways, while others still escape resolution. High-bandwidth, low-noise single-channel measurements may provide details about state transitions in other high-conductance channels; and similar procedures may also be applied to channel- and nanopore-based single-molecule DNA measurements.
