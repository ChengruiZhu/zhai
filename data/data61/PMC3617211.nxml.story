Organizing gene functions into molecular pathways is a major challenge in biology. The observation that two viable gene mutations become lethal when combined as a double mutant has been developed into a major genetic tool called synthetic lethality. The classic interpretation of synthetic lethality stipulates that the two mutations identify genes that work in parallel, mutually compensatory pathways that together perform an essential function. However, a significant number of negative interactions are caused by defects affecting a single molecular pathway. Here, we recapitulate by mathematical modeling recent experimental data that demonstrate synthetic lethality between mutations in genes acting in a single, non-essential molecular pathway. We propose a novel mechanism involving reversible pathways steps and trapping of an intermediate. The modeling also predicts that overexpression of certain genes functioning in reversible pathways will lead to synthetic lethality with gene defects in the same pathway. Our results significantly broaden the interpretation of synthetic lethal and synthetic dosage effects, which fundamentally impacts the assignment of genes to pathways. The concept of synthetic lethality has been applied to cancer therapy, and our modeling results suggest new approaches to how to target a single pathway to induce synthetic lethality in cancer cells.
