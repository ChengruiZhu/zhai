YB-1 (Y-box binding protein 1) is a multifunctional cold-shock protein that has been implicated in all hallmarks of cancer. Elevated YB-1 protein level was associated with poor prognosis in several types of cancers, including breast cancer (BC), where it is a marker of decreased overall survival (OS) and distant metastasis-free survival across all subtypes. YB-1 is also secreted by different cell types and may act as an extracellular mitogen; however the pathological implications of the secreted form of YB-1 (sYB-1) are unknown. Our purpose was to retrospectively evaluate the association between YB-1 measured by ELISA in serum and disease characteristics and outcomes in patients with BC and bone metastases (BM). In our cohort, sYB-1 was detected in the serum of 22 (50%) patients, and was associated with the presence of extra-bone metastases (p=0.044). Positive sYB-1 was also associated with faster bone disease progression (HR 3.1, 95% CI 1.09–8.95, P=0.033), but no significant differences were observed concerning OS, and time to development of skeletal-related events. Moreover, patients with positive sYB-1 also had higher levels of IL-6, a known osteoclastogenic inducer. Therefore, detection of sYB-1 in patients with BC and BM may indicate a higher tumor burden, in bone and extra-bone locations, and is a biomarker of faster bone disease progression.
