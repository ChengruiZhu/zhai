Aurora-A kinase functions mainly in centrosome maturation, separation and spindle formation. It has also been found to be amplified or overexpressed in a range of solid tumors, which is linked with tumor progression and poor prognosis. Importantly, Aurora-A inhibitors are being studied in a number of ongoing clinical trials. However, whether and how Aurora-A has a role in the regulation of the mitotic checkpoint is controversial. Additionally, the function of nuclear-accumulated Aurora-A in late G2 phase is not clear. Here we show that knockout, inhibition or blockade of the nuclear entry of Aurora-A severely decreased the centromere localization of Aurora-B and the phosphorylation of histone H3 threonine 3 (H3T3-ph) mediated by the kinase Haspin in late G2 phase. We further reveal that nuclear-accumulated Aurora-A phosphorylates Haspin at multiple sites at its N-terminus and that this promotes H3T3-ph and the rapid recruitment to the centromere of the chromosomal passenger complex. In addition, Aurora-A facilitates the association of Aurora-B with their common substrates: Haspin and Plk1. Notably, these functions of Aurora-A are mostly independent of Plk1. Thus we demonstrate that, in late G2 and prophase, Aurora-A phosphorylates Haspin to trigger the Haspin-H3T3-ph-Aurora-B positive feedback loop that supports the timely establishment of the chromosomal passenger complex and the mitotic checkpoint before spindle assembly.
