Evolutionary dynamics arise from the interplay of mutations acting on genotypes and natural selection acting on phenotypes. Understanding the structure of the genotype-phenotype (GP) map is therefore critical for understanding evolutionary processes. We address a simple question about structure: Are the genotypes positively correlated? That is, will the mutational neighbours of a genotype be more likely to map to similar phenotypes than expected from random chance? John Maynard Smith and others have argued that the intuitive answer is yes. Here we quantify these intuitions by comparing model GP maps for RNA secondary structure, protein tertiary structure, and protein quaternary structure to a random GP map. We find strong neutral correlations: Point mutations are orders of magnitude more likely than expected by random chance to link genotypes that map to the same phenotype, which vitally increases the potential for evolutionary innovation by generating neutral networks. If GP maps were uncorrelated like the random map, evolution may not even be possible. We also find correlations for non-neutral mutations: Mutational neighbourhoods are less diverse than expected by random chance. Such local heterogeneity slows down the rate at which new phenotypic variation can be found. But non-neutral correlations also enhance evolvability by lowering the probability of mutating to a deleterious non-folding or non-assembling phenotype.
