The purpose of this study was to investigate the usefulness of Fuji Computed Radiography (FCR) 5501D by comparing it with FCR 5000 and a screen‐film system (S/F). Posteroanterior chest radiographs often patients with no abnormality on chest CT scans were obtained with FCR 5501D, FCR 5000, and S/F. Six observers (three radiologists and three radio‐technologists) evaluated the visibility of nine normal anatomic structures (including lungs, soft tissue, and bones) and overall visibility on each image. Observers scored using a five‐point scale on each structure. FCR 5000 showed a significantly higher score in soft tissue and bone structures, and overall visibility compared with S/F, but, there was no significant difference between them in the visibility of all four normal lung structures. Compared with S/F, the score for FCR 5501D was higher in eight of the nine normal structures, including three of the four lung structures (unobscured lung, retrocardiac lung, and subdiaphragmatic lung), and overall visibility. Compared with FCR 5000, the score for FCR 5501D was higher in three normal structures, including two of the four lung structures (unobscured lung and subdiaphragmatic lung), and overall visibility. FCR 5501D was the best among the three techniques to visualize normal anatomic structures, particularly the obscured and unobscured lung. ©
