Within the cell's nucleus, DNA closely associates with histone proteins, forming a structure known as chromatin. Packaging DNA into chromatin allows for efficient storage of the genome, and it also provides an additional means of regulating processes, such as gene expression, that require access to DNA. Two copies each of the four core histones (H2A, H2B, H3, H4) associate with approximately 150 base pairs of DNA to make up the basic unit of chromatin, the nucleosome. In addition to the core histones, variants exist that have specialized functions within chromatin. One such variant is H2A.Z, which is essential for cell viability. Here, we describe an approach by which to characterize proteins that interact with H2A.Z-containing nucleosomes. Our findings reveal that many of the identified proteins may interact with H2A.Z nucleosomes by recognizing specific chemical modifications uniquely present on H2A.Z nucleosomes. One such protein, Brd2, interacted in a manner dependent on recognition of acetylated histone residues that are enriched on H2A.Z nucleosomes. Furthermore, this interaction is required for expression of hormone-responsive genes in prostate cancer cells. By this approach, we uncovered a key mediator linking H2A.Z to transcriptional regulation and found a potentially targetable step to regulate prostate cell proliferation.
