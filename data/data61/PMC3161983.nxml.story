Aquatic birnavirus induces mitochondria-mediated cell death, but whether connects to endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress is still unknown. In this present, we characterized that IPNV infection triggers ER stress-mediated cell death via PKR/eIF2α phosphorylation signaling for regulating the Bcl-2 family protein expression in fish cells. The IPNV infection can induce ER stress as follows: (1) ER stress sensor ATF6 cleavaged; (2) ER stress marker GRP78 upregulation, and (3) PERK/eIF2αphosphorylation. Then, the IPNV-induced ER stress signals can induce the CHOP expression at early (6 h p.i.) and middle replication (12 h p.i.) stages. Moreover, IPNV-induced CHOP upregulation dramatically correlates to apparently downregulate the Bcl-2 family proteins, Bcl-2, Mcl-1 and Bcl-xL at middle replication stage (12 h p.i.) and produces mitochondria membrane potential (MMP) loss and cell death. Furthermore, with GRP78 synthesis inhibitor momitoxin (VT) and PKR inhibitor 2-aminopurine (2-AP) treatment for blocking GRP78 expression and eIF2α phosphorylation, PKR/PERK may involve in eIF2α phosphorylation/CHOP upregulation pathway that enhances the downstream regulators Bcl-2 family proteins expression and increased cell survival. Taken together, our results suggest that IPNV infection activates PKR/PERK/eIF2α ER stress signals for regulating downstream molecules CHOP upregulation and Bcl-2 family downregulation that led to induce mitochondria-mediated cell death in fish cells, which may provide new insight into RNA virus pathogenesis and disease.
