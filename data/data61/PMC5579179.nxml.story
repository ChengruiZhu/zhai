Purinergic P2X and P2Y receptors are involved in mediating intercellular signalling via purines such as adenosine triphosphate (ATP). P2X and P2Y receptors have been implicated in numerous body functions including learning, memory and sleep. All of these body functions show time-of–day-dependent variations controlled by the master circadian oscillator located in the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN). Evidence exists for a role of purinergic signalling in intercellular coupling within SCN. However, few studies have been performed on the expression of purinergic receptors in SCN. Therefore, we analyse the expression of seven P2X (P2X1–7) and eight P2Y (P2Y1–2, 4, 6, 11–14) receptors in mouse SCN and address their time-of-day-dependent variation by using immunohistochemistry and real-time polymerase chain reaction. At the early light phase, P2X and P2Y receptors show a low to moderate, homogenously distributed immunoreaction throughout SCN. P2Y13 reveals strong immunoreaction in fibres within the core region of SCN. From the fifteen analysed P2 receptors, seven exhibit a time-of-day-dependent variation in SCN. P2X1 immunoreaction is very low in the early light phase with a minor increase at the end of the dark phase. P2X4 immunoreaction strongly increases during the dark phase in soma cells in the core region and in a dense network of fibres in the shell region of SCN. P2X3 immunoreaction is moderately elevated during the dark phase. Conversely, immunoreaction for P2Y2, P2Y12 and P2Y14 moderately increases at the early light phase and P2Y6 immunoreaction displays a moderate increase at the mid-light phase. Thus, this study demonstrates a time-of-day-dependent variation of P2 receptors in mouse SCN.
