Liver stem/progenitor cells (LPCs) are defined as cells that supply two types of liver epithelial cells, hepatocytes and cholangiocytes, during development, cellular turnover, and regeneration. Hepatoblasts, which are fetal LPCs derived from endoderm stem cells, robustly proliferate and differentiate into hepatocytes and cholangiocytes during fetal life. Between mid-gestation and the neonatal period, some cholangiocytes function as LPCs. Although LPCs in adult livers can be enriched in cells positive for cholangiocyte markers, their tissue localization and functions in cellular turnover remain obscure. On the other hand, it is well known that liver regeneration under conditions suppressing hepatocyte proliferation is supported by LPCs, though their origin has not been clearly identified. Recently many groups took advantage of new techniques including prospective isolation of LPCs by fluorescence-activated cell sorting and genetic lineage tracing to facilitate our understanding of epithelial supply in normal and injured livers. Those works suggest that, in normal livers, the turnover of hepatocytes mostly depends on duplication of hepatocytes. It is also demonstrated that liver epithelial cells as well as LPCs have great plasticity and flexible differentiation capability to respond to various types of injuries by protecting or repairing liver tissues.
