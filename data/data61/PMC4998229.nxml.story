Metastasis to the adrenal glands is a relatively frequent observation at autopsy of patients that have succumbed to cancer. Long-term disease-free survival has been reported in patients following the resection of solitary adrenal metastasis resulting from colorectal cancer. In addition, following primary resection for colorectal cancer, solitary metastasis to the adrenal glands is rare, even in outpatients at routine follow-ups. Therefore, adrenal metastasis is usually detected in combination with multiple synchronous metastases at other sites in the terminal stages of cancer. Between 1998 and 2002, 3 patients with adrenal metastasis and other synchronous metastatic sites underwent surgery for adrenal metastasis at the Department of Gastroenterological Surgery at Osaka University. The other synchronous metastatic sites observed in the 3 patients consisted of lung and para-aortic lymph nodes. In total, 2 out of the 3 patients experienced long-term disease-free survival for >5 years following surgery and 1 patient underwent curative resection for recurrence of metastases in the liver and right adrenal gland 79 months subsequent to the initial resection for adrenal metastasis. All 3 patients survived for >90 months. In conclusion, aggressive surgical resection for adrenal metastasis and other metastatic sites resulting from colorectal cancer may result in a survival benefit in selected patients.
