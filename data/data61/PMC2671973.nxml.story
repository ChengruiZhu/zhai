In recent years, many researchers have investigated the various factors that can
          influence body posture: mood states, anxiety, head and neck positions, oral functions
          (respiration, swallowing), oculomotor and visual systems, and the inner ear. Recent
          studies indicate a role for trigeminal afferents on body posture, but this has not yet
          been demonstrated conclusively. The present study aims to review the papers that have
          shown a relationship between the stomatognathic system and body posture. These studies
          suggest that tension in the stomatognathic system can contribute to impaired neural
          control of posture. Numerous anatomical connections between the stomatognathic
          systemâ€™s proprioceptive inputs and nervous structures are implicated in
          posture (cerebellum, vestibular and oculomotor nuclei, superior colliculus). If the
          proprioceptive information of the stomatognathic system is inaccurate, then head control
          and body position may be affected. In addition, the present review discusses the role the
          myofascial system plays in posture. If confirmed by further research, these considerations
          can improve our understanding and treatment of muscular-skeletal disorders that are
          associated with temporomandibular joint disorders, occlusal changes, and tooth loss.
