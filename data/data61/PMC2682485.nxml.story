The first step in the expression of eukaryotic protein-coding genes is transcription into a messenger RNA (mRNA) precursor in the nucleus. These precursor mRNAs then undergo maturation through the removal of introns in a process termed splicing. During splicing, the splicing machinery or “spliceosome” deposits a complex of proteins onto the mRNA that accompanies it during post-transcriptional steps in gene expression, including the regulation of mRNA stability, transport out of the nucleus, cellular localisation, and translation. This complex, the exon junction complex (EJC), represents a molecular memory of the splicing process. Understanding the biogenesis of EJCs and their downstream effects helps reveal the basic principles by which the primary steps of mRNA synthesis are coupled to the regulation of gene expression. Here we show that EJCs are assembled in a strictly splicing-dependent manner through an unexpected, coordinated, and hierarchical assembly pathway. Importantly, we show that the EJC recruits the cytoplasmic protein BTZ, which then bridges the complex to an mRNA quality-control machinery called the nonsense-mediated decay pathway that degrades mRNAs containing premature stop codons. This finding suggests that the EJC and bridging by BTZ help determine the stability of mRNA and thus are essential for proper cellular surveillance of mRNA quality.
