Stereo-specific perturbation of the IgE-receptor (shown in previous studies) produces a monophasic rise in cyclic AMP that peaks at 15 s and a depletion of cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase that plateaus at 30-60 s. The previously observed linear relationship between the attenuation in the monophasic rise in cyclic AMP and the quantity of mediator release in the presence of incremental concentrations of the adenosine analogue 2',5',-dideoxyadenosine, DDA, which is known to inhibit adenylate cyclase, indicated a direct relationship between receptor perturbation, transmembrane activation of adenylate cyclase, and granule secretion. The role of cyclic AMP as a second messenger in this sequence is now apparent from the linear relationship between net percent mediator release and net percent activation of cyclic AMP- dependent protein kinase isoenzyme when IgE-dependent activation of adenylate cyclase is suppressed by incremental quantities of DDA. There was a comparable percent activation of both types I and II mast cell cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase isoenzymes with anti-IgE-induced activation and secretion, and there was a parallel suppression of the activation of both isoenzymes in the presence of DDA. Although these studies firmly link the activation of cytoplasmic cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase to the IgE receptor-initiated transmembrane activation of adenylate cyclase. they do not discriminate among the functions of the two isoenzymes.
