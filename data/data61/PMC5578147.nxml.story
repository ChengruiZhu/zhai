Matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) is dysregulated in chronic kidney diseases including diabetic nephropathy. This study was performed to examine the expression of MMP-9 in renal tubule epithelial cells (TECs) under diabetic conditions and its regulatory mechanisms. We characterized MMP-9 protein in diabetic animals and primary cultured rat TECs exposed to exogenous albumin and high glucose. We also used specific inhibitors to determine if internalization of albumin and/or extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2) phosphorylation were required for MMP-9 secretion. Immunostaining of kidney sections revealed enhanced MMP-9 signal in the damaged proximal tubules in Zucker diabetic fatty (ZDF) rats. ZDF rats also exhibited an albuminuria-related and age-dependent increase in MMP-9 excretion, which was prevented by rosiglitazone. In primary cultured rat TECs, high glucose exposure did not increase MMP-9 secretion. In contrast, administration of rat serum albumin (RSA, 0.1â€“0.5 mg/mL) resulted in a dose-dependent increase in MMP-9 expression and secretion by TECs, which was abolished in the presence of an ERK1/2-specific inhibitor, U0126. Simvastatin, an inhibitor of albumin endocytosis, also prevented MMP-9 secretion. Taken together, these results demonstrate that endocytosis of albumin stimulates MMP-9 secretion by TECs through the ERK signaling pathway.
