, USA) in 2002 and subsequently adopted in other areas of the USA. Survival rates of patients with primary cardiac arrest and a shockable rhythm significantly improved wherever it was adopted. Cardiocerebral resuscitation has three components: the community, the pre‐hospital, and the hospital. The community component emphasizes bystander recognition and chest compression only resuscitation. Its pre‐hospital or emergency medical services component emphasizes: (i) urgent initiation of 200 uninterrupted chest compressions before and after each indicated single defibrillation shock, (ii) delayed endotracheal intubation in favor of passive delivery of oxygen by a non‐rebreather mask, (iii) early adrenaline administration. The hospital component was added later. The national and international guidelines for cardiopulmonary resuscitation and emergency medical services are still not optimal, for several reasons, including the fact that they continue to recommend the same approach for two entirely different etiologies of cardiac arrest: primary cardiac arrest, often caused by ventricular fibrillation, where the arterial blood oxygenation is little changed at the time of the arrest, and secondary cardiac arrest from severe respiratory insufficiency, where the arterial blood is severely desaturated at the time of cardiac arrest. These different etiologies need different approaches to therapy.
