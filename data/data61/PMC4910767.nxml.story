Bladder cancer (BC) is the fifth most common cancer worldwide and is associated with significant morbidity and mortality. The prognosis of muscle invasive BC is poor, and recurrence is common after radical surgery or chemotherapy. Therefore, new diagnostic methods and treatment modalities are critical. MicroRNAs (miRNAs), a class of small noncoding RNAs, regulate the expression of protein-coding genes by repressing translation or cleaving RNA transcripts in a sequence-specific manner. miRNAs have important roles in the regulation of genes involved in cancer development, progression, and metastasis. The availability of genomewide miRNA expression profiles by deep sequencing technology has facilitated rapid and precise identification of aberrant miRNA expression in BC. Indeed, several miRNAs that are either upregulated or downregulated have been shown to have associations with significant cancer pathways. Furthermore, many miRNAs, including those that can be detected in urine and blood, have been studied as potential noninvasive tumor markers for diagnostic and prognostic purposes. Here, we searched PubMed for publications describing the role of miRNAs in BC by using the keywords "bladder cancer" and "microRNA" on March 1, 2016. We found 374 papers and selected articles written in English in which the level of scientific detail and reporting were sufficient and in which novel findings were demonstrated. In this review, we summarize these studies from the point of view of miRNA-related molecular networks (specific miRNAs and their targets) and miRNAs as tumor markers in BC. We also discuss future directions of miRNA studies in the context of therapeutic modalities.
