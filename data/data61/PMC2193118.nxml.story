Members of the suppressor of cytokine signaling (SOCS) family were discovered as negative regulators of cytokine signaling by inhibition of the Janus kinase–signal transducer and activator of transcription (Jak-STAT) pathway. Among them, cytokine-induced Src homology 2 (SH2) protein (CIS) was found to inhibit the interleukin 3– and erythropietin-mediated STAT5 signaling pathway. However, involvement of SOCS proteins in other signaling pathways is still unknown. This study shows that the expression of CIS is selectively induced in T cells after T cell receptor (TCR) stimulation. In transgenic mice, with selective expression of CIS in CD4 T cells, elevated CIS strongly promotes TCR-mediated proliferation and cytokine production in vitro, and superantigen-induced T cell activation in vivo. Forced expression of CIS also prolongs survival of CD4 T cells after TCR activation. Molecular events immediately downstream from the TCR are not changed in CIS-expressing CD4 T cells, but activation of mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase pathways by TCR stimulation is significantly enhanced. Together with the increased MAP kinase activation, a direct interaction of CIS and protein kinase Cθ was also demonstrated. These results suggest that CIS is one of the important regulators of TCR-mediated T cell activation. The functions of CIS, enhancing TCR signaling and inhibiting cytokine signaling, may be important in the regulation of immune response and homeostasis.
