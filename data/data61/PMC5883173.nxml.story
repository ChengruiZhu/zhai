This study presents the results of four Ligamentum Teres (LT) reconstruction procedures for hip instability with an average of 21.4 months follow-up (range 16.4â€“27.8). The indication for reconstruction was patients who complained of hip instability (hip giving way on gait or activities of daily living) on a background of a connective tissue disorder and generalized ligamentous laxity. The following data were recorded: age, sex, body mass index, hip range of motion, impingement signs, acetabular coverage (lateral center edge angle and acetabular inclination), acetabular retroversion (ischial spine sign and a crossover sign), femoral alpha angles and femoral neck shaft angles. Four patient recorded outcomes (PROs) were collected at 3 months, 12 months and 24 months. Three patients were female. Three out of four procedures had an improvement in PROs. One patient with bilateral procedures had an improvement in PROs on one side at 1 year but a failure of the graft on the contralateral side. There were no complications reported with the technique. LT reconstruction and concomitant capsular plication in this case series is associated with an improvement in outcomes in three out of four of the patients with hip instability associated with a full thickness tear of the LT and who presented with hip instability on a background of generalized ligamentous laxity and a connective tissue disorder. However, the physical examination, radiographic and intra-operative findings which may help predict who would benefit from LT reconstruction require further investigation.
