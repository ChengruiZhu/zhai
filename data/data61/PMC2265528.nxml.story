During mammalian development, genome-wide DNA demethylation occurs both in developing germ cells and in fertilized oocytes. This rapid DNA demethylation is an active process that occurs in the absence of DNA replication. The mechanism of active DNA demethylation represents a conundrum for researchers in this field, i.e. the breakage of a carbon-carbon bond to remove a methyl group from the DNA cytosine ring appears energetically unfavorable, and the elimination of approximately 30 million 5-methylcytosine bases from both DNA strands within a short time window raises questions about the maintenance of genome stability during this process. Recently, it has been reported that the protein GADD45A, a small acidic protein that has been implicated in the DNA damage response, plays a crucial role in promoting active DNA demethylation in several mammalian cell lines. We noticed that GADD45A does not fulfill one likely requirement for a mammalian DNA demethylase factor in that it is not expressed in oocytes or zygotes. We then investigated the role of GADD45A in DNA demethylation using methylated reporter plasmids and DNA methylation analysis of several endogenous genes in cell lines overexpressing GADD45A. Contrary to the previous report, we were not able to demonstrate a role of GADD45A in DNA demethylation. The activity that promotes DNA demethylation at a genome-wide level in mammals remains to be identified.
