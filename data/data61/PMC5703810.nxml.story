 chosen to provide extreme diagnostic difficulty. Carbapenemases such as KPC, NMC-A, IMI, SME, NDM, SPM, IMP, VIM, and OXA-23, 40, 48, 58, 72, 181, and 232 were produced by 243 isolates and 51 carbapenemase-negative isolates included porin mutants and producers of extended-spectrum β-lactamases (ESBLs), AmpCs, K1, and broad-spectrum β-lactamases. Both tests exhibited high sensitivity of carbapenemase detection (>97%). Due to the highly challenging carbapenemase-negative isolates, specificities were lower than typical for evaluations involving mostly routine clinical isolates. BD Phoenix CPO Detect was 68.6% specific and Rapidec Carba NP was 60.8% to 78.4% specific, depending on how borderline results were interpreted. Only BD Phoenix CPO Detect classified carbapenemases. It correctly classified 85.0% of class A, 72.4% of class B, and 88.6% of class D carbapenemases. Importantly with respect to empirical therapy with new β-lactamase inhibitor combinations such as ceftazidime/avibactam, no class B carbapenemases were misclassified as class A carbapenemases. Both tests offer advantages. Used alone, without initial susceptibility tests, Rapidec Carba NP can provide positive results for some isolates after only 10 to 30 min incubation. BD Phoenix CPO Detect provides novel advantages such as automated carbapenemase detection, inclusion in susceptibility panels to eliminate delays and subjectivity in initiating carbapenemase tests, and classification of most carbapenemases.
