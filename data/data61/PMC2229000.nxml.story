Intact single twitch fibers from frog muscle were studied on an optical bench apparatus after micro-injection with two indicator dyes: phenol red, to monitor a previously described signal (denoted delta pHapp; Hollingworth and Baylor. 1990. J. Gen. Physiol. 96:473-491) possibly reflective of a myoplasmic pH change following action potential stimulation; and fura-2, to monitor the associated change in the myoplasmic free calcium concentration (delta[Ca2+]). Additionally, it was expected that large myoplasmic concentrations of fura-2 (0.5-1.5 mM) might alter delta pHapp, since it was previously found (Baylor and Hollingworth. 1988. J. Physiol. 403:151-192) that the Ca2(+)-buffering effects of large fura-2 concentrations: (a) increase the estimated total concentration of Ca2+ (denoted by delta[CaT]) released from the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR), but (b) reduce and abbreviate delta[Ca2+]. The experiments show that delta pHapp was increased at the larger fura- 2 concentrations; moreover, the increase in delta pHapp was approximately in proportion to the increase in delta[CaT]. At all fura- 2 concentrations, the time course of delta pHapp, through time to peak, was closely similar to, although probably slightly slower than, that of delta[CaT]. These properties of delta pHapp are consistent with an hypothesis proposed by Meissner and Young (1980. J. Biol. Chem. 255:6814-6819) and Somlyo et al. (1981. J. Cell Biol. 90:577-594) that a proton flux from the myoplasm into the SR supplies a portion of the electrical charge balance required as Ca2+ is released from the SR into the myoplasm. A comparison of the amplitude of delta pHapp with that of delta[CaT] indicates that, in response to a single action potential, 10- 15% of the charge balance required for Ca2+ release may be carried by protons.
