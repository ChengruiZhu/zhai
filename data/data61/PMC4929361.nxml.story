Hepatitis C is frequently accompanied by immune-related extrahepatic manifestations affecting the skin, kidneys, central and peripheral nervous system and exocrine glands. We present the case of a 40-year-old man with left-sided ptosis, exophthalmos and headache. MRI demonstrated left-sided orbital pseudotumor with lacrimal and retro-orbital contrast enhancement extending to the cavernous sinus and the vestibulocochlear nerve. Immunological tests of serum and cerebrospinal fluid identified hepatitis C virus (HCV) as a potential causative agent but did not indicate any additional infectious, malignant or immunological disorder. Hepatological evaluation revealed no signs of advanced liver disease. After initial spontaneous improvement, the patient subsequently developed vestibulocochlear failure with gait disorder, tinnitus and transient left-parietal sensory loss. Lacrimal biopsy demonstrated lymphocytic infiltrate, prompting steroid treatment. After initial improvement, steroids could not be tapered below 40 mg daily for several months due to recurrent symptoms. Twelve months after the initial presentation, the patient's chronic HCV infection was successfully treated with sofosbuvir, simeprevir and ribavirin and he remains now free of symptoms without steroids. In patients with chronic hepatitis C, lymphocytic infiltrate of the salivary and lacrimal glands is a frequent phenomenon. However, the extent of the lymphocytic infiltrate beyond the lacrimal gland to the tip of the orbit, cavernous sinus and vestibulocochlear nerve as in our patient is highly unusual. For all symptomatic extrahepatic manifestations of hepatitis C infection, treatment of HCV as the underlying immune stimulus is recommended, and it helped to control the symptoms in our patient. In addition, long-term follow-up for recurrent lymphocyte infiltrate and development of lymphoma is warranted.
