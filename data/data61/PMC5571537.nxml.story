The liver, the largest organ with multiple synthesis and secretion functions in mammals, consists of hepatocytes and Kupffer, stem, endothelial, stellate and other parenchymal cells. Because of early and extensive contact with the external environment, hepatic ischaemia reperfusion (IR) may result in mitochondrial dysfunction, autophagy and apoptosis of cells and tissues under various pathological conditions. Because the liver requires a high oxygen supply to maintain normal detoxification and synthesis functions, it is extremely susceptible to ischaemia and subsequent reperfusion with blood. Consequently, hepatic IR leads to acute or chronic liver failure and significantly increases the total rate of morbidity and mortality through multiple regulatory mechanisms. An increasing number of studies indicate that mitochondrial structure and function are impaired after hepatic IR, but that the health of liver tissues or liver grafts can be effectively rescued by attenuation of mitochondrial dysfunction. In this review, we mainly focus on the subsequent therapeutic interventions related to the conservation of mitochondrial function involved in mitigating hepatic IR injury and the potential mechanisms of protection. Because mitochondria are abundant in liver tissue, clarification of the regulatory mechanisms between mitochondrial dysfunction and hepatic IR should shed light on clinical therapies for alleviating hepatic IR‚Äêinduced injury.
