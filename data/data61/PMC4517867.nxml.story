Multi-cellular physiology is an emergent property, which depends critically on inter-cellular signaling pathways. Transmembrane G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) mediate a large variety of physiological events throughout the body, such as vision or cardiovascular regulation. It is thus no surprise that GPCRs are targeted by more than one third of all FDA-approved drugs. Molecules such as hormones and neurotransmitters transmit messages to cells via GPCRs complexed to cytosolic heterotrimeric G proteins. G proteins, upon activation, interact with other molecules to trigger a cellular response. Despite an increasing amount of structural data, the precise conformational dynamics and activation mechanism of G proteins remain poorly understood. The size of the multi-protein complexes and the time scales at which conformational changes occur hinder adequate sampling of the conformational landscape with molecular dynamics simulations. Here, we extend and use an efficient, robotics-inspired conformational sampling procedure to probe the conformational landscape of protein G during activation. Our procedure reveals coupled, molecular mechanisms of the activation pathway, which are absent in a comparative analysis with normal modes. Our exciting results can ultimately lead to modulation of biological activity by drug design or fine-tuning of conformational heterogeneity.
