Carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) is a cancer vaccines target. Several feature of recombinant adeno-associated virus (rAAV) are attractive for vaccine applications. Combining other viral vector vaccines with Toll like receptor (TLR) agonists enhances antitumor immunity. Wild-type and CEA transgenic (Tg) mice were immunized with rAAV expressing CEA, the TLR9 agonist, ODN1826, and the TLR7 agonist, imiquimod. Mice were challenged with MC38 colon tumor cells and MC38 cells expressing CEA. rAAV-CEA immunization combined with ODN1826 or imiquimod enhanced CEA-specific T-helper-1 immunity and protected against tumor challenge in wild-type but not in CEA-Tg mice. In contrast, immunization with rAAV-CEA in CEA-Tg mice could abrogate the antitumor effects of ODN1826 and promote tumor growth. Compared to wild-type, CEA-Tg mice were characterized by a greater myeloid suppressor cell and T-helper 2 response to TLR agonists and to syngeneic tumors. Depleting PDCA1+ plasmacytoid dendritic cells and Gr1+ myeloid cells increased anti-CEA immune responses in CEA-Tg mice to rAAV-CEA-ODN1826 immunization; depleting CD25+ T cells did not. There are differences in the response of wild-type and CEA-Tg mice to rAAV-CEA, TLR agonists, and syngeneic tumor. In CEA-Tg mice tumor growth can be promoted with rAAV-CEA and TLR agonists. Dendritic and myeloid cells play a regulatory role.
