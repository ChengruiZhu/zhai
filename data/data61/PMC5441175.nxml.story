The pathogenesis of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) has not been unclear yet, it might be associated with the abnormal expression and distribution of certain proteins. Aldehyde dehydrogenases 1A2 (ALDH1A2) was thought to be one of potential candidates. Therefore, in this study we observed and analyzed the alteration of the expression and distribution of ALDH1A2 in the spinal cord of wild-type (WT) and Tg(SOD1*G93A)1Gur mice. We compared the expression and distribution of ALDH1A2 in the different segments, anatomic regions and neural cells of spinal cord at the different stages of WT and Tg(SOD1*G93A)1Gur mice applied the methods of fluorescent immunohistochemistry and western blot. Results revealed that ALDH1A2 extensively expressed and distributed in the spinal cord of adult WT and Tg(SOD1*G93A)1Gur mice. The expression and distribution of ALDH1A2 in the white matter including the anterior, posterior and lateral funiculus were more than that in the gray matter including the central canal, the anterior and dorsal horn. ALDH1A2 majorly expressed and distributed in the astrocyte, microglial, oligodendrocyte and neuron cells. The ALDH1A2 expression significantly decreased and redistributed in some anatomic regions of spinal cord at the onset and progression stages of Tg(SOD1*G93A)1Gur mice. The expression decrease of ALDH1A2 followed with the increase of neuron cells death. This study suggested that the alteration of expression and distribution of ALDH1A2 was potentially associated with the pathogenesis of ALS.
