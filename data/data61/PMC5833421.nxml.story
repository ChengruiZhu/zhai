Autophagy has emerged as a critical pathway in tumor development. S100A4 plays important roles in tumor metastasis, but its role in regulating autophagy has not been well characterized. In this study, we found that S100A4 was significantly upregulated in lung adenocarcinoma tissues. Clinical investigation demonstrated that high expression level of S100A4 was associated with tumor size and advanced tumor grades of lung adenocarcinoma patients. Moreover, our results revealed that extracellular S100A4 or overexpression of S100A4 inhibited starvation-induced autophagy and promoted cell proliferation in lung cancer cells in vitro; whereas small interfering RNA (siRNA)-mediated suppression of S100A4 increased autophagy and reduced cell viability in both A549 and LLC cells. Additionally, S100A4 inhibited starvation-induced autophagy to promote tumor cell viability via the Wnt pathway. Increased expression of β-catenin consistently led to a decreased LC3-II protein abundance. Further, the inhibitory effect of S100A4 on autophagy and its promotion role in cell proliferation was abolished in A549 and LLC cells using the receptor for advanced glycation end products (RAGE)-specific inhibitor (FPS-ZM1). S100A4-deficient mice showed retarded tumor development. This effect was well correlated with increased expression of autophagy markers. Our findings demonstrate that S100A4 promotes lung tumor development through inhibiting autophagy in a β-catenin signaling and S100A4 receptor RAGE-dependent manner, which provides a novel mechanism of S100A4-associated promotion of tumor development.
