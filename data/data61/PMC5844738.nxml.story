The current study aimed to identify a comprehensive expression-profile of microRNAs (miRNAs) in expressed prostatic secretion (EPS) collected from healthy men and patients with CP/CPPS (Chronic prostatitis/Chronic pelvic pain syndrome). After clinical screening of 382 participants, 60 healthy men and 59 IIIA CP/CPPS patients with significant pelvic-pain were included into this study from March 2012 to December 2014. High-throughput sequencing was employed to identify characteristic expression-profile of EPS-miRNAs. QRT-PCR was further performed to confirm elevated levels of differential EPS-miRNAs. Finally, candidate EPS-miRNAs were measured traceably in 21 follow-up patients and their classify-accuracy on IIIA CP/CPPS were analyzed by ROC (receiver operating characteristic) curve. In discovery-phage, 41 and 43 predominant EPS-miRNAs were found in pooled EPS-sample from 40 healthy men and 39 IIIA CP/CPPS patients, respectively. Furthermore, 22 abundant EPS-miRNAs were up-regulated with â‰¥ 2-fold in 20 patients compared to 20 healthy men. In testing-phage, elevated levels of miR-21-5p, miR-30a-5p, miR-30d-5p, miR-103a-3p and miR-141-3p were further confirmed in 33 patients by comparing to 30 healthy men. In validation-phage, relieved pelvic-pain symptom of 21 follow-up patients was found to be accompanied by significant down-regulation of miR-21-5p, miR-103a-3p and miR-141-3p. Particularly, ROC curve analysis indicated the highest area under ROC curve (AUC) was found for miR-21-5p (0.891), followed in order by miR-141-3p and miR-103a-3p. Our studies provided evidence that secretory miRNAs existed in EPS and dysregulated EPS-miRNAs were associated with prostatitis. In particular, miR-21-5p possessed a high classify-accuracy for IIIA CP/CPPS patients with significant pelvic pain.
