The mammalian brain responds to environmental stimuli through changes in gene expression. Over the past decade a robust body of bioinformatics data has shown that in neuronal tissue such gene expression is regulated by changes in the epigenetic landscape, including modifications to chromatin. Further, a small but compelling body of literature has recently described chromatin-regulated alternative splicing, suggesting a novel function for neuroepigenetic remodeling in alternative isoform expression. However, the extent of the genome-wide association between particular histone modifications and alternative splicing remains unclear, in part due to limitation in methods to model the convergence of chromatin modifications and gene expression changes. We report here our innovative computational approach to model the association between alternative splicing and histone marks in the nucleus accumbens, a brain reward region. We found, remarkably, that specific histone marks are associated with and predict both alternative splicing exon type and alternative splicing exon complexity in the brain, with particular histone marks showing the significant enrichment at alternative exons. This approach is the first to model chromatin-mediated alternative splicing globally, and our findings are consistent with recent data on the molecular biology of this mechanism, homing in on a subset of chromatin modifications that are functionally relevant to alternative splicing
