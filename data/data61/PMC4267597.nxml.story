Of 2,312 respondents, 2,218 (95.9%) answered all questions and were included in the analysis. Although both Course-M and Course-S significantly augmented willingness to make early emergency calls not only in Scenario-M but also in Scenario-S, the willingness for Scenario-M after training course was significantly higher in respondents of Course-S than in those of Course-M (odds ratio 1.706, 95% confidential interval 1.301–2.237). Multiple logistic regression analysis for Scenario-M disclosed that post training (adjusted odds ratio 11.6, 95% confidence interval 7.84–18.0), age (0.99, 0.98–0.99), male gender (1.77, 1.39–2.24), prior BLS experience of at least three times (1.46, 1.25–2.59), and time passed since most recent training during 3 years or less (1.80, 1.25–2.59) were independently associated with willingness to make early emergency calls and that type of BLS course was not independently associated with willingness. Therefore, both Course-M and Course-S similarly augmented willingness in Scenario-M. However, in multiple logistic regression analyses for Scenario-S, Course-S was independently associated with willingness to make early emergency calls in Scenario-S (1.26, 1.00–1.57), indicating that Course-S more efficiently augmented willingness. Moreover, post training (2.30, 1.86–2.83) and male gender (1.26, 1.02–1.57) were other independent factors associated with willingness in Scenario-S.
