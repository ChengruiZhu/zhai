Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) is common in patients with many chronic diseases, but has not been well recognized in rheumatoid arthritis (RA). We investigated the prevalence of GERD symptoms in 278 outpatients with RA and their association with such clinical factors as age, sex, height, weight, body mass index, medications drugs, and functional status evaluated by the Modified Health Assessment Questionnaire (MHAQ). GERD symptoms were evaluated by Frequency Scale for the Symptoms of GERD (FSSG). The mean FSSG score for all patients was 5.6, and 82 patients were considered to have GERD symptoms (FSSG score â‰¥8), thus the overall prevalence of GERD symptoms was 29.5%. MHAQ score and height were significantly higher and lower, respectively, and prednisolone usage was significantly more in the patients with GERD symptoms than those without. These three clinical factors were also significantly associated with GERD symptoms by univariate logistic regression. Multivariate logistic regression analysis demonstrated that MHAQ was the only clinical factor related to GERD symptoms. In conclusion, the prevalence of GERD symptoms in RA patients was high and strongly associated with decreased functional status, suggesting that physicians should pay attention to GERD symptoms in RA management, especially for patients with low functional status.
