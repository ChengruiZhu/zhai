Urachal carcinomas are rare bladder malignances, which usually present at an advanced stage with a high risk of distant metastases and a poor prognosis. To improve understanding of this uncommon carcinoma, a retrospective review was conducted for the cases observed at Peking University Shenzhen Hospital and Peking University First Hospital. The clinical outcomes were analyzed for 17 patients with a diagnosis of urachal cancer, who were admitted to Peking University Shenzhen Hospital (Shenzhen, China) and Peking University First Hospital (Beijing, China) between 1998 and 2013. The TNM staging system was used to predict outcomes. Among the 17 study patients, there were 10 males and seven females, with a median age at diagnosis of 50 years. A total of four (23%) patients presented with lymph node or distant metastasis. The median overall survival time for all stages was 57.6 months, with five patients (38.4%) alive for more than five years following treatment. The application of the TNM staging system demonstrated a median survival time of 6.2 years for stage I/II patients, compared with a median survival of 1.8 years (log-rank, P<0.001) for patients with advanced disease (stages III and IV). In addition, no significant correlation was observed between tumor size and age, and survival. In conclusion, urachal carcinomas are usually locally advanced at presentation. Surgical excision remains the predominant choice of treatment and lymph node dissection is not required unless lymph node involvement is confirmed by preoperative examination. The current results indicated that the most significant predictor of prognosis was the tumor grade.
