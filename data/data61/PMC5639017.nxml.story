In order to clarify the change in mandibular movement during chewing of foods with different hardness, 20 healthy subjects were asked to chew 3 types of gummy jellies (containing 6, 8, and 10% gelatin), and the masseter muscular activity and the mandibular movement were recorded. The indicators representing the muscular activity (integral value of masseter muscular activity), the mandibular movement (opening distance, masticatory width, cycle time, opening maximum velocity and closing maximum velocity), and the stability of masticatory movement were calculated, respectively, and compared among the three foods. The integral value of masseter muscular activity was smallest for the 6% gelatin and significantly increased in order as the content of gelatin increased to 8, 10%. The value of each indicator for the mandibular movement increased gradually as the food got harder. The value for all indicators was significantly larger for the 10 than the 6%. However, between the two foods, no significant change was observed for the several indicators. The mean ratio of the 10% gelatin to the 8% gelatin for the cycle time was extremely small, being 1.01, but was between the range of 0.89â€“1.07 showing aspects of changes within each individual. The other indicators showing small ratio were similar in this aspect. The parameters representing stability of movement showed the lowest values for the 8% gelatin. It was suggested that the hardness of food affected mandibular movement during mastication, but the movement changed variously according to the hardness and exerted muscular activities.
