Reduction in the incidence of cancer can be achieved through appropriate health behaviors. We hypothesized that education would improve knowledge of cancer prevention, and this, in turn, will affect and individual’s readiness to modify lifestyle. The aim of this study was to assess the impact of cancer prevention education on adopting and preserving prohealth attitudes among high school students in Poland. Research participants were 307 high school students varying by gender, place of residence, parents’ education, and type of school education. Participants were divided into five groups, of which four were educated using different methods according to classification methods based on the concept of multilateral learning. The fifth (control) group was not educated. The effects of education were assessed 1 month and 1 year after education. General knowledge about cancer and healthy lifestyle level before education was low. After education, both increased compared with the control group. There was a clear relationship between level of knowledge and readiness to adopt and healthy attitudes and behavior. The most effective method of education was a discussion and a lecture by means of teaching complex. Education significantly improved generally low knowledge about cancer and healthy lifestyle in high school students. This indicates the urgent need to implement such educational programs.
