Intra-organ flow is the most critical parameter in machine-perfused organ preservation systems (MPS). Ultrasonic flow sensors (UFS) are commonly employed in MPS. However, UFS are sensitive to changes in fluid composition and temperature and require recalibration. Novel Coriolis-type mass flow sensors (CFS) may be more suitable for MPS because the measurement technique is not amenable to these factors. The effect of viscosity, colloids, temperature, pressure, and preservation solution on flow measurement accuracy of UFS and CFS was therefore investigated. A CFS-based MPS was built and validated for setpoint stability using porcine kidneys and the ability to reproduce different pressure and flow waveforms. The UFS exhibited a temperature- and preservation solution-dependent overestimation of flow rate compared to the CFS. The CFS deviated minimally from the actual flow rate and did not require recalibration. The CFS-based MPS conformed to the preprogrammed temperature, flow, pressure, and vascular resistance settings during 6-h kidney preservation. The system was also able to accurately reproduce different pressure and flow waveforms. Conclusively, CFS-based MPS are more suitable for organ preservation than UFS-based MPS. Our CFS-based MPS provides a versatile yet robust experimental platform for testing and validating different types of clinical and experimental MPS.
