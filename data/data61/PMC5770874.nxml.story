Skeletal muscle has emerged as one of the most important tissues involved in regulating systemic metabolism. The gastrocnemius is a powerful skeletal muscle composed of predominantly glycolytic fast‐twitch fibers that are preferentially lost among old age. This decrease in gastrocnemius muscle mass is remarkable during aging; however, the underlying molecular mechanism is not fully understood. Strikingly, there is a ~70% decrease in Cisd2 protein, a key regulator of lifespan in mice and the disease gene for Wolfram syndrome 2 in humans, within the gastrocnemius after middle age among mice. A proteomics approach was used to investigate the gastrocnemius of naturally aged mice, and this was compared to the autonomous effect of Cisd2 on gastrocnemius aging using muscle‐specific Cisd2 knockout (mKO) mice as a premature aging model. Intriguingly, dysregulation of calcium signaling and activation of UPR/ER stress stand out as the top two pathways. Additionally, the activity of Serca1 was significantly impaired and this impairment is mainly attributable to irreversibly oxidative modifications of Serca. Our results reveal that the overall characteristics of the gastrocnemius are very similar when naturally aged mice and the Cisd2 mKO mice are compared in terms of pathological alterations, ultrastructural abnormalities, and proteomics profiling. This suggests that Cisd2 mKO mouse is a unique model for understanding the aging mechanism of skeletal muscle. Furthermore, this work substantiates the hypothesis that Cisd2 is crucial to the gastrocnemius muscle and suggests that Cisd2 is a potential therapeutic target for muscle aging.
