This study investigated the prevalence of apical periodontitis (AP) and its association with endodontically treated teeth in residents of São Luís, MA, Brazil. Two-hundred complete series of periapical radiographs taken over a 10-year period (1993-2003) were retrieved from the files of four prosthesists and five periodontists. The Periapical Index (PAI) was used and the age range, sex, tooth groups, location and association with endodontic treatment (ET) were also analyzed. The Cohen Kappa and Chi-square tests were used for statistical analysis. Out of 200 patients, 135 presented at least one case of AP, which corresponds to a prevalence of 67.5%. Of the 5008 teeth examined, 296 had AP and 553 had ET. Therefore, considering the total number of teeth, AP and ET prevalences were 5.9% and 11%, respectively. Of the 553 endodontically treated teeth, 235 (42.5%) were associated with AP. Chi-square test showed a strong correlation between AP and ET (p<0.05). The 40-year-old age group was significantly the most prevalent (p<0.05). There was no association between AP and patient's sex (p>0.05). The maxillary incisors were the most affected group of teeth (p<0.05). AP had predilection for the maxilla and was strongly associated with endodontically treated teeth (p<0.05). The prevalence of apical periodontitis and endodontically treated teeth with AP was high and similar to the results of studies performed in other countries.
