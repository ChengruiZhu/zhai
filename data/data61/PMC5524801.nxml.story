Superficial temporal artery-middle cerebral artery (STA-MCA) has been used for the treatment of occlusive cerebrovascular disease including moyamoya disease. The effect of STA-MCA bypass depends not only on the patency of anastomosis, but also on integrity and functional capacity of the donor artery. In the present prospective study, we investigated the effect of extensive stripping STA adventitia and fasciae on hemodynamic function in STA-MCA bypass of moyamoya disease patients. Twenty patients (n=8 in control group, n=12 in stripping group) of moyamoya disease were subjected to STA-MCA end-to-side direct anastomosis. Perfusion unit (PU) values of the cortex were measured and recorded using a Laser Doppler flowmetry (LDF) for 5 days. Computed tomography perfusion was performed to determine blood flow before and after bypass. No patient experienced significant neurologic deficits associated with neurosurgical complications. LDF demonstrated that adventitial stripping group had higher cerebral blood flow increase than control group. The adventitia stripping group tends to have higher rate of increased cerebral perfusion after bypass than non-stripping group. Furthermore, the ultrasound examination at 3 days after bypass demonstrated that the adventitial stripping group has a tendency of bigger STA and higher peak systolic velocity than control group. Our result suggests that stripping adventitia of STA improves hemodynamics of STA-MCA bypass in moyamoya disease.
