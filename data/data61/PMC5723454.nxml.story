Pediatric patients are at higher risk to the adverse effects from exposure to ionizing radiation than adults. The smaller sizes of the anatomy and the reduced X‐ray attenuation of the tissues provide special challenges. The goal of this effort is to investigate strategies for pediatric fluoroscopy in order to minimize the radiation exposure to these individuals, while maintaining effective diagnostic image quality. Modern fluoroscopy systems are often entirely automated and computer controlled. In this paper, various selectable and automated modes are examined to determine the influence of the fluoroscopy parameters upon the patient radiation exposures and image quality. These parameters include variable X‐ray beam filters, automatic brightness control programs, starting kilovolt peak levels, fluoroscopic pulse rates, and other factors. Typical values of radiation exposure rates have been measured for a range of phantom thicknesses from 5 cm to 20 cm of acrylic. Other factors that have been assessed include spatial resolution, low‐contrast discrimination, and temporal resolution. The selection menu for various procedures is based upon the examination type, anatomical region, and patient size. For pediatric patients, the automated system can employ additional filtration, special automatic brightness control curves, pulsed fluoroscopy, and other features to reduce the patient radiation exposures without significantly compromising the image quality. The benefits gained from an optimal selection of automated programs and settings for fluoroscopy include ease of operation, better image quality, and lower patient radiation exposures.
