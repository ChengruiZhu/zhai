Recent microscopy based time-lapse measurements of spindle assembly in the absence of pre-existing centrosomes, have improved our understanding of the principles of self-organization at a cellular scale. Mouse oocytes meiosis is one such example, where radial microtubule (MT) arrays, or asters, nucleated by MT organizing centers (MTOCs) centripetally converge on the central chromatin mass and reorganize to form a bipolar structure. This centripetal motility resembles a biased ‘search-and-capture’ process. Here we attempt to test whether such a bias is necessary and if so, to define the form and nature of the bias. We quantify the statistics of the experimentally measured motility and find MTOC transport involves both “pulling” from the center and “pushing” from the cortex. We hypothesize that the bias consists of a spatial gradient of forces driving this motility. To test this hypothesis, we develop a model of a random walk with drift in the mouse oocyte geometry. By optimizing the functional form of the drift field to experimental data, we then explore which minimal combination of molecular motors and dynamic instability parameters in such a gradient, could result in the generation of asymmetric forces. When minus-end directed dynein-like motors are localized in a gradient around chromatin, it reproduces the experimental spatio-temporal dynamics. By themselves, MT regulatory gradients, clustering motor complexes and cortical pushing fail to reproduce experimental statistics. A combination of the motor-gradient and clustering motors appears to explain all the available experimental statistics. Our findings suggest a possible functional role for previously observed enrichment of dynein around chromatin in mouse oocytes, and address how MTs asters find the center of a large cell, without the predominance of cortical interactions.
