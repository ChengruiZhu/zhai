Predictive coding theories represent a unifying account of psychosis, stating that the central psychosis-related alteration affects the interplay between prior predictions and incoming information. Since every incoming information is imprecise and potentially allows for different interpretations, prior expectations achieve the enforcement of interpretations with a higher prior probability. Disturbances in this basic framework might let unlikely interpretations come into effect, resulting in proneness for delusions and hallucinations. Here, we contribute to these theories by devising a novel computational model for behavior in a reasoning task that quantifies the participants' readiness to draw inferences from very surprising information. We thereby demonstrate that precisely this increased learning from surprising and thus potentially spurious information, as opposed to non-specific alterations in the general learning speed, predispose healthy individuals for delusions and hallucinations. The present results hence speak for the hypothesis that hallucinations and delusions arise when noisy information is considered as precise and is thus not suppressed by opposing prior beliefs. In this sense, our findings also tie with recent neurophysiological models of psychosis that posit aberrations in modulatory neurotransmitters such as dopamine (or its interactions with GABAergic interneurons) as a correlate of perturbed computations of information precision in the cortex.
