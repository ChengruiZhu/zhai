The objective of the present study was to evaluate the application of dual-source CT perfusion imaging and MRI for the diagnosis of primary liver cancer. Sixty-three patients with primary liver cancer were selected between February 2015 and May 2016. All patients underwent examinations by dual-source CT perfusion imaging and MRI. The perfusion parameters of the focus center and normal liver parenchyma by CT examination and the hemodynamic parameters of the focus center and normal liver parenchyma by MRI examination were analyzed. The accuracy rates of the three detection methods (CT perfusion imaging, MRI, and combined examination) were analyzed and compared by ROC curves. Dual-source CT perfusion imaging revealed that blood flow and blood volume of the focus center were significantly higher than those of normal liver parenchyma (P<0.05). MRI examination showed that hepatic arterial perfusion and hepatic perfusion index of the focus center were significantly higher than those of normal liver parenchyma; portal venous perfusion of the focus center was significantly lower than that of normal liver parenchyma (P<0.05); the difference in total liver perfusion between the focus center and normal liver parenchyma was not significant (P>0.05); the accuracy rates of CT perfusion imaging, MRI, and combined examination were 76.19, 85.71, and 95.24% respectively; the area under the curve of CT perfusion imaging was 0.753 (P<0.05), the sensitivity was 79.2% and the specificity was 74.7%; the area under the curve of MRI was 0.846 (P<0.05), the sensitivity was 84.6%, and the specificity was 80.5%; the area under the curve of CT combined with MRI was 0.947 (P<0.05), the sensitivity was 94.6%, and the specificity was 86.5%. In conclusion, the effect of dual-source CT perfusion imaging combined with MRI for examination of primary liver cancer is superior to that of single use of CT or MRI, and has high clinical application and popularization value.
