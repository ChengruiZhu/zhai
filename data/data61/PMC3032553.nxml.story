, there are high levels of c-di-GMP within the bacterial cell when there is plentiful nutrient availability inside the cell, and the c-di-GMP levels determine stable biofilm formation outside the cell. LapD, a transmembrane receptor for intracellular c-di-GMP, communicates changing c-di-GMP levels to the outside of the cell by controlling the stability of the large adhesin protein LapA, which keeps bacteria attached to a surface or to other cells. We conducted X-ray crystallographic analyses of the structure of the intracellular and periplasmic modules of LapD that, in combination with functional studies, including those shown in an accompanying study by Newell et al., reveal the molecular mechanisms regulating receptor function. When phosphate availability is severely restricted, intracellular c-di-GMP levels are low and LapD is in held in an “off” state by an autoinhibitory interaction, which permits the proteolytic processing of LapA, its release from the cell surface, and consequently biofilm dispersal. Conversely, when there are higher phosphate levels in the growth medium, c-di-GMP increases and binds to a cytoplasmic domain of LapD, disrupting the autoinhibitory state and triggering a conformational change that sequesters the periplasmic protease responsible for cleavage of LapA, ultimately yielding stable cell attachment. By revealing key motifs for the regulation of LapD, we have identified similar systems in many other bacterial strains that may control periplasmic protein processing events in a similar fashion.
