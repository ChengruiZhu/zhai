Near infrared radiation can be used for warm stimulation in caloric irrigation of the equilibrium organ. Aim of this study was to determine
whether near infrared radiation offers effective stimulation of the vestibular organ, whether it is well tolerated by the patients and especially
whether it is a viable alternative to warm air stimulation in patients with defects of the tympanic membrane and radical mastoid cavities.
Patients with perforations of the tympanic membrane (n = 15) and with radical mastoid cavities (n = 13) were tested both with near infrared
radiation and warm dry air. A caloric-induced nystagmus could be seen equally effectively and rapidly in all patients. Contrary to stimulation
with warm dry air, no paradoxical nystagmus was observed following caloric irrigation with a warm stimulus (near infrared radiation).
Results of a questionnaire showed excellent patient acceptance of near infrared stimulation with no arousal effects or unpleasant feeling.
In conclusion, near infrared radiation proved to be an alternative method of caloric irrigation to warm dry air in patients with tympanic
membrane defects and radical mastoid cavities. Near infrared radiation is pleasant, quick, contact free, sterile and quiet. With this method
an effective caloric warm stimulus is available. If near infrared radiation is used for caloric stimulus no evaporative heat loss occurs.
