A central challenge in cognitive neuroscience is decoding mental representations from patterns of brain activity. With functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), multivariate decoding methods like multivoxel pattern analysis (MVPA) have produced numerous discoveries about the brain. However, what information these methods draw upon remains the subject of debate. Typically, each voxel is thought to contribute information through its selectivity (i.e., how differently it responds to the classes being decoded), with improved sensitivity reflecting the aggregation of selectivity across voxels. We show that this interpretation downplays an important factor: MVPA is also highly attuned to noise correlations between voxels with opposite selectivity. Across several analyses of an fMRI dataset, we demonstrate a positive relationship between the magnitude of noise correlations and multivariate decoding performance. Indeed, voxels more selective for one class, or heavily weighted in MVPA, tend to be more strongly correlated with voxels selective for the opposite class. Furthermore, using a model to simulate different levels of selectivity and noise correlations, we find that the benefit of noise correlations for decoding is a general property of fMRI data. These findings help elucidate the computational underpinnings of multivariate decoding in cognitive neuroscience and provide insight into the nature of neural representations.
