The silencing of tumor suppressor genes (TSGs) by aberrant DNA methylation occurs frequently in acute myeloid leukemia (AML). This epigenetic alteration can be reversed by 5-aza-2â€™-deoxcytidine (decitabine, 5-AZA-CdR). Although 5-AZA-CdR can induce complete remissions in patients with AML, most patients relapse. The effectiveness of this therapy may be limited by the inability of 5-AZA-CdR to reactivate all TSGs due to their silencing by other epigenetic mechanisms such as histone methylation or chromatin compaction. EZH2, a subunit of the polycomb repressive complex 2, catalyzes the methylation of histone H3 lysine 27 (H3K27) to H3K27me3. 3-Deazaneplanocin-A (DZNep), an inhibitor of methionine metabolism, can reactivate genes silenced by H3K27me3 by its inhibition of EZH2. In a previous report, we observed that 5-AZA-CdR, in combination with DZNep, shows synergistic antineoplastic action against AML cells. Gene silencing due to chromatin compaction is attributable to the action of histone deacetylases (HDAC). This mechanism of epigenetic gene silencing can be reversed by HDAC inhibitors such as trichostatin-A (TSA). Silent TSGs that cannot be reactivated by 5-AZA-CdR or DZNep have the potential to be reactivated by TSA. This provides a rationale for the use of HDAC inhibitors in combination with 5-AZA-CdR and DZNep to treat AML.
