The recent creation of enormous, cancer-related “Big Data” public depositories represents a powerful means for understanding tumorigenesis. However, a consistently accurate system for clinically evaluating single/multi-biomarkers remains lacking, and it has been asserted that oft-failed clinical advancement of biomarkers occurs within the very early stages of biomarker assessment. To address these challenges, we developed a clinically testable, web-based tool, CANcer-specific single/multi-biomarker Evaluation System (CANES), to evaluate biomarker effectiveness, across 2,134 whole transcriptome datasets, from 94,147 biological samples (from 18 tumor types). For user-provided single/multi-biomarkers, CANES evaluates the performance of single/multi-biomarker candidates, based on four classification methods, support vector machine, random forest, neural networks, and classification and regression trees. In addition, CANES offers several advantages over earlier analysis tools, including: 1) survival analysis; 2) evaluation of mature miRNAs as markers for user-defined diagnostic or prognostic purposes; and 3) provision of a “pan-cancer” summary view, based on each single marker. We believe that such “landscape” evaluation of single/multi-biomarkers, for diagnostic therapeutic/prognostic decision-making, will be highly valuable for the discovery and “repurposing” of existing biomarkers (and their specific targeted therapies), leading to improved patient therapeutic stratification, a key component of targeted therapy success for the avoidance of therapy resistance.
