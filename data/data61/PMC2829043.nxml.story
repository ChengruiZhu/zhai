When a species is grown under optimal conditions the single-knockout of most of its genes is not likely to affect its viability. The resilience of biological systems to mutations is termed genetic robustness and its extent across different species has not yet been systematically described. Since the deletion of a gene can have varying consequences depending on the environmental conditions, the extent of species' genetic robustness reflects both the range of conditions (or environments) in which it can survive as well as the availability of alternative cellular routes (compensating for a gene's loss of function). Here, we developed a computational model for estimating the essentiality of metabolic reactions across natural-like environments and applied it to chart species' level of genetic robustness, providing the first systematic description of genetic robustness across species. Studying robustness across a wide collection of natural-like environments enables one to stratify, for each species individually, the extent of environmental-dependant and independent robustness and hence advances our understanding of its evolutionary origins. Our main finding is that the level of environmental dependent robustness is associated with the lifestyle of a species (i.e., specialists versus generalist), whereas the level of environmental-independent robustness is associated with its metabolic production capacities.
