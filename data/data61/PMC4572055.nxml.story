Proinflammatory cytokines and growth factors, which regulate mutual interactions between immune system cells and bone tissue cells, play a major role in the formation of bone changes in rheumatoid arthritis (RA). The aim of the work was to assess serum concentration of osteoprotegerin (OPG), RANKL, Dkk-1 and sclerostin in RA patients compared to a control group and to analyze changes of these concentrations during methotrexate (MTX) therapy. Patients enrolled in the study were 30 women of Caucasian origin aged 30–74 years with RA. Patients with active form of the disease were administered recommended doses of MTX for at least 6 months. The study group was divided into subgroup I—patients with improvement; and subgroup II—patients with no improvement. The control group consisted of 12 healthy women in the age of 41–73. Before MTX therapy, RA patients had higher levels of RANKL (644.97 ± 477.13 vs. 255.19 ± 130.26 pmol/l), lower values of OPG/RANKL (0.01 ± 0.0101 vs. 0.02 ± 0.0078) and higher levels of Dkk-1 protein (1821.32 ± 1060.28 vs. 548.52 ± 36.35 pg/ml) compared to the control group. In the analyzed group of patients (all patients receiving MTX regardless of responder non responder status) after 6 months of therapy, a statistically significant increase in the ratio of OPG/RANKL was found (0.0118 ± 0.0102 vs. 0.0141 ± 0.0118;
