Research and clinical experience with vagotomy have confirmed that damage to the central nervous system severely affects physiological movement in the gastrointestinal system. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of synchronized dual-pulse gastric electrical stimulation (SGES) on the apoptosis of enteric neurons and the possible pathways involved in these effects in vagotomized rats. For this purpose, Male Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats were randomized into a control group, an early subdiaphragmatic vagotomized group (ESDV group), an early subdiaphragmatic vagotomized group with short-term SGES (ESDV + SSGES group), a terminal subdiaphragmatic vagotomized group (TSDV group) and a terminal subdiaphragmatic vagotomized group with long-term SGES (TSDV + LSGES group). The expression levels of connexin 43 (Cx43), glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF), p-Akt, pan-Akt and PGP9.5 were assessed by RT-qPCR, western blot analysis and immunofluorescence staining. Apoptosis was determined by terminal-deoxynucleoitidyl transferase-mediated nick-end labeling (TUNEL) assay. We found that Cx43 expression was decreased in the ESDV and TSDV groups, but was significantly upregulated in the SSGES and LSGES groups. In addition, the GDNF and PGP9.5 expression levels were significantly decreased in the ESDV group compared with the control and TSDV groups and were upregulated in both the SSGES and LSGES groups. The LSGES group exhibited a clear increase in p-Akt expression compared with the TSDV group. Fewer TUNEL-positive cells were observed in the SSGES and LSGES groups than in the ESDV and TSDV groups. More TUNEL-positive cells were found in the stomach of rats subjected to subdiaphragmatic vagotomy. On the whole, our data indicate that SGES improved enteric neuronal survival, possibly through GDNF and the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt pathways.
