, the Arab scholar Ibn al-Haytham suggested that visual experience was not veridical, but inherently subjective. During the last few decades, this observation has given rise to one of the core questions in visual neuroscience: how does the subjective experience of visual stimuli relate to their neural representations in the brain? It is well-known that visual shape is represented in a brain region called lateral occipital complex (LOC). However, do these representations reflect physical or perceptual stimulus characteristics? We presented observers with a set of complex visual stimuli and obtained three measures of similarity for these stimuli: a physical similarity measure based on stimulus parameters; a behavioral similarity measure based on discrimination performance; and finally a neural similarity measure based on multivariate pattern analyses in LOC. We found that in anterior LOC, neural stimulus similarities correlated with subjective perceptual similarities, but not with physical stimulus similarities; the reverse was true in posterior LOC. In addition, neural similarities were consistent across participants in posterior LOC, but highly variable across participants in anterior LOC. Together these findings suggest a two-part answer to the question of how cortical object representations relate to subjective experience: anterior regions appear to contain subjective, individually variable shape representations, whereas posterior regions contain stimulus-based shape representations.
