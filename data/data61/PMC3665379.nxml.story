The purpose of this study is to evaluate the role of tympanometry, in particular of the inter-aural asymmetry ratio in peak compliance as a function of different mild-low frequencies ABG on the affected side, in the diagnostic work-up in patients with unilateral SSCD. The working hypothesis is that an increase in admittance of the "inner-middle ear" conduction system due to a "third mobile window" could be detected by tympanometry. A retrospective review of the clinical records of 45 patients with unilateral dehiscence selected from a pool of 140 subjects diagnosed with SSCD at our institution from 2003 to 2011 was performed. Values of ABG amplitude on the dehiscent side and tympanometric measurements of both ears were collected for each patient in the study group (n = 45). An asymmetry between tympanometric peak compliance of the involved side and that of the contralateral side was investigated by calculating the inter-aural difference and the asymmetry ratio of compliance at the eardrum. A statistically significant correlation (p = 0.015 by Fisher's test) between an asymmetry ratio â‰¥ 14% in favour of the pathologic ear and an ABG > 20 dB nHL on the same side was found. When "evocative" symptoms of SSCD associated with important ABG occur, the inter-aural difference in tympanometric peak compliance at the eardrum in favour of the "suspected" side could suggest an intra-labyrinthine origin for the asymmetry. Tympanometry would thus prove to be a useful instrument in clinical-instrumental diagnosis of SSCD in detection of cases associated with alterations of inner ear impedance.
