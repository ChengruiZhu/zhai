Macrophages can respond to a variety of infectious and/or inflammatory stimuli by secreting an
array of proinflammatory cytokines, the overproduction of which can result in shock or even
death. In this report, we demonstrate that ligation of macrophage Fcγ receptors (FcγR) can
lead to a reversal of macrophage proinflammatory responses by inducing an upregulation of interleukin (IL)-10, with a reciprocal inhibition of IL-12 production. IL-10 upregulation was
specific to FcγR ligation, since the ligation of the Mac-1 receptor did not alter IL-10 production. The identification of the specific FcγR subtype responsible for IL-10 upregulation was
determined in gene knockout mice. Macrophages from mice lacking the FcR γ chain, which is
required for assembly and signaling by FcγRI and FcγRIII, failed to upregulate IL-10 in response to immune complexes. However, mice lacking either the FcγRII or the FcγRIII were
fully capable of upregulating IL-10 production, implicating FcγRI in this process. The biological consequences of FcγRI ligation were determined in both in vitro and in vivo models of inflammation and sepsis. In all of the models tested, the ligation of FcγR promoted the production of IL-10 and inhibited the secretion of IL-12. This reciprocal alteration in the pattern of
macrophage cytokine production illustrates a potentially important role for FcγR-mediated
clearance in suppressing macrophage proinflammatory responses.
