The architectural complexity of the hepatocyte canalicular surface has prevented examination of apical membrane dynamics with methods used for other epithelial cells. By adopting a pharmacological approach, we have documented for the first time the internalization of membrane proteins from the hepatic apical surface. Treatment of hepatocytes or WIF-B cells with phosphoinositide 3-kinase inhibitors, wortmannin or LY294002, led to accumulation of the apical plasma membrane proteins, 5â€²-nucleotidase and aminopeptidase N in lysosomal vacuoles. By monitoring the trafficking of antibody-labeled molecules, we determined that the apical proteins in vacuoles came from the apical plasma membrane. Neither newly synthesized nor transcytosing apical proteins accumulated in vacuoles. In wortmannin-treated cells, transcytosing apical proteins traversed the subapical compartment (SAC), suggesting that this intermediate in the basolateral-to-apical transcytotic pathway remained functional. Ultrastructural analysis confirmed these results. However, apically internalized proteins did not travel through SAC en route to lysosomal vacuoles, indicating that SAC is not an intermediate in the apical endocytic pathway. Basolateral membrane protein distributions did not change in treated cells, uncovering another difference in endocytosis from the two domains. Similar effects were observed in polarized MDCK cells, suggesting conserved patterns of phosphoinositide 3-kinase regulation among epithelial cells. These results confirm a long-held but unproven assumption that lysosomes are the final destination of apical membrane proteins in hepatocytes. Significantly, they also confirm our hypothesis that SAC is not an apical endosome.
