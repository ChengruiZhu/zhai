The behaviour of biological systems is governed by protein interactions. Considerable effort has already been dedicated to characterise individual proteins and their evolution. As a next step, researchers need to understand the characteristics, dynamics, and evolution of complex networks of proteins. While many experimental techniques determine high-throughput proteinâ€“protein interactions, only few provide structural insights into the actual interfaces. The authors provide a comprehensive compendium and classification of these structural interfaces. To this end, they design a fast and accurate algorithm, which they apply to all known structural interactions. As a result, they shed light on the geometry and the evolution of protein interfaces. Their analysis reveals that 40% of protein interactions between homologues associate in multiple orientations. This has, in particular, implications for gene fusion events detected by conventional sequence homology: for one-third of these genes, the fused and nonfused proteins associate in alternative binding orientations. The classification also shows that any evolutionary analysis, such as interface conservation, can be skewed by multiple binding orientations and interaction partners. Hub proteins, which are highly connected to many other proteins in interaction networks, are shown to use distinct surfaces, or faces, for different partners. Interestingly, some proteins develop many different faces for the same partner (e.g., long-chain cytokines and fibronectin), and others use the same face for evolutionary unrelated partners (e.g., the PUA domain family). Finally, the authors show that ancient interfaces, which appear in all three kingdoms of life, are dominated by symmetric homodimers, reflecting the direction of evolution from symmetric to asymmetric or heteromeric.
