Determination of the half‐value layer (HVL) and quarter‐value layer (QVL) values is not an easy task in X‐ray computed tomography (CT), because a nonrotating X‐ray tube must be used, which requires the assistance of service engineers. Therefore, in this study, we determined the accuracy of the lead‐covered case method, which uses X‐rays from a rotating X‐ray tube, for measuring the HVL and QVL in CT. The lead‐covered case was manufactured from polystyrene foam and a 4 mm thick lead plate. The ionizing chamber was placed in the center of the case and aluminum filters were placed 15 cm above the aperture surface. Aperture widths of 1.0, 2.0, and 3.0 cm for a tube voltage of 110 kV and an aperture width of 2.0 cm for the tube voltages of 80 and 130 kV were used to measure exposure doses. The results of the HVL and QVL were compared with those of the conventional nonrotating method. A 2.0 cm aperture was believed to be adequate, because of its small differences in the HVL and QVL in the nonrotating method and its reasonable exposure dose level. When the 2.0 cm aperture was used, the lead‐covered case method demonstrated slightly larger HVLs and QVLs (0.03‐0.06 mm for the HVL and 0.2‐0.4 mm for the QVL) at all the tube voltage settings. However, the differences in the effective energy were 0.1‐0.3 keV; therefore, it could be negligible in an organ‐absorbed dose evaluation and a quality assurance test for CT.
