Chick ciliary ganglion neurons have a membrane component that shares an antigenic determinant with the main immunogenic region (MIR) of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors from skeletal muscle and electric organ. Previous studies have shown that the component has many of the properties expected for a ganglionic nicotinic acetylcholine receptor, and that its distribution on the neuron surface in vivo is restricted predominantly to synaptic membrane. Here we report the presence of a large intracellular pool of the putative receptor in embryonic neurons and demonstrate that it is associated with organelles known to comprise the biosynthetic and regulatory pathways of integral plasma membrane proteins. Embryonic chick ciliary ganglia were lightly fixed, saponin- permeabilized, incubated with an anti-MIR monoclonal antibody (mAb) followed by horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody, reacted for peroxidase activity, and examined by electron microscopy. Deposits of reaction product were associated with synaptic membrane, small portions of the pseudodendrite surface membrane, most of the rough endoplasmic reticulum, small portions of the nuclear envelope, some Golgi complexes, and a few coated pits, coated vesicles, multivesicular bodies, and smooth-membraned vacuoles. No other labeling was present in the neurons. The labeling was specific in that it was not present when the anti-MIR mAb was replaced with either nonimmune serum or mAbs of different specificity. Chick dorsal root ganglion neurons thought to lack nicotinic acetylcholine receptors were not labeled by the anti-MIR mAb. Substantial intracellular populations have also been reported for the muscle acetylcholine receptor and brain voltage-dependent sodium channel alpha-subunit. This may represent a general pattern for multisubunit membrane proteins during development.
