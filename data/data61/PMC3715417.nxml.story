Post-translational modifications, i.e. chemical changes of protein amino acids, play a key role in different cellular processes, ranging from enzymatic activation to transcription and translation regulation to disease development and aging. However, our understanding of their effects on protein structure, dynamics and interaction networks at the atomistic level is still largely incomplete. In particular, molecular dynamics simulations, despite their power to provide a high-resolution insight into biomolecular function and underlying mechanisms, have been limited to unmodified, native proteins due to a surprising deficiency of suitable tools and systematically developed parameters for treating modified proteins. To fill this gap, we develop and validate force field parameters, an essential part of the molecular dynamics method, for more than 250 different types of enzymatic and non-enzymatic post-translational modifications. Additionally, using this tool, we quantitatively show that microscopic properties of target amino acids, such as hydrophobicity, are greatly affected by the majority of modifications. The parameters presented in this study greatly expand the range of applicability of computational methods, and in particular molecular dynamics simulations, to a large set of new systems with utmost biological and biomedical importance.
