In this work, we develop and test a matchline dosimetry analysis tool (MDAT) to examine the dose distribution within the abutment region of two or more adjoining radiotherapy fields that employ different blocking mechanisms and geometries in forming a match. This objective and quantitative tool uses calibrated radiographic film to measure the dose in the abutment region, and uses a frequency distribution of area versus dose (a dose‐area histogram) to visualize the spatial dose distribution. We tested the MDAT's clinical applicability and parameters by evaluating the dose between adjacent photon fields incident on a flat phantom using field‐matching techniques employing collimator‐jaw and multileaf collimator (MLC) configurations. Additionally, we evaluated the dose in the abutment regions of four different clinical tangential‐breast and supraclavicular matching techniques using various combinations of collimator and MLC matches. Using the MDAT tool, it was determined that a 1 cm abutment region width (centered about the theoretical matchline between fields) is the most appropriate width to determine dose homogeneity in a field matching region. Using the MDAT, both subtle and large differences were seen between fields that used MLCs to form the match, compared to flat edge devices such as collimators and external cerrobend blocks. We conclude that the MDAT facilitates a more precise evaluation of the distribution of dose within the region of abutment of radiotherapy fields.
