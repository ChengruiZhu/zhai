 1. Crystalline hexokinase has been isolated from baker's yeast. 2. Crystalline hexokinase is a protein of albumin type of a molecular weight of 96,000. Its isoelectric point is at about pH 4.8. 3. The method of isolation consists in separating the proteins of an aqueous extract of toluene-treated yeast by means of fractional precipitation with ammonium sulfate and with alcohol. 4. The procedure involves also the separation of several crystalline proteins, including one yellow crystalline protein, which do not possess hexokinase activity. The biological and the physicochemical properties of these proteins are still under investigation. 5. The crystallization of hexokinase proceeds at about 5Â°C. in the presence of ammonium sulfate and dilute phosphate buffer pH 7.0. 6. Crystalline hexokinase becomes relatively pure after 2 or 3 recrystallizations as tested by solubility, sedimentation in the ultracentrifuge, and electrophoresis. The enzymatic activity remains constant on repeated crystallization. 7. The enzymatic activity is associated with the protein nature of the material. Inactivation is accompanied by denaturation of the protein. 8. Crystalline hexokinase is relatively stable when stored in the form of crystalline filter cake. Solutions of hexokinase in dilute buffers are most stable at pH 5.0. 9. Crystalline hexokinase requires the presence of magnesium ions for its catalytic activity.
