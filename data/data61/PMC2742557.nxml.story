It has recently been proposed that mosquito vectors of malaria may be controlled by biopesticide sprays containing spores of fungi that are pathogenic to mosquitoes, causing reduced blood feeding activity and eventual death. This technique has been shown to have strong potential to reduce malaria transmission rates, and may be most effective when combined with other interventions as part of an integrated vector management strategy. I develop a model to quantify the total impact of combined interventions that can affect mosquitoes at different ages and stages in their lifecycle. As a case study, I consider the combined use of fungal biopesticides and insecticide- treated bednets (ITNs), a widespread and important vector control method. The model demonstrates that these interventions combined can have strong effects on malaria transmission even in situations where each intervention acting alone has relatively little impact. In situations difficult for malaria control due to high transmission intensity and widespread insecticide resistance, the performance of the combined interventions is improved by synergistic interactions between the interventions, whereby the ITN intervention improves the performance of the fungal biopesticide intervention. The results suggest that the combined use of ITNs and fungal biopesticides may be an efficient and effective method of malaria control.
