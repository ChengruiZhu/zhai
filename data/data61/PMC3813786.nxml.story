Glioblastoma is the most malignant and common intrinsic brain tumor, but the molecular mechanism of glioma pathophysiology is poorly understood. Recent data have shown that microRNAs regulate the expression of several genes associated with human cancer. In the present study, the function of miR-34c in glioma cells was analyzed. It was demonstrated that miR-34c-3p and miR-34c-5p were downregulated in gliomas, by performing qPCR on tumor tissues from glioma patients and glioma cell lines, compared with normal brain tissues and a normal glial cell line. Furthermore, the miR-34c expression was found to be inversely correlated with glioma WHO grades. Overexpression of miR-34c-3p inhibited U251 and U87 cell proliferation; however, miR-34c-5p only had an effect on U251 cells. Transfection with miR-34c-3p or miR-34c-5p in U251 cells and with miR-34c-3p in U87 cells produced S-phase arrest with G0/G1 reduction and induced cell apoptosis, but no significant changes were observed with miR-34c-5p transfection in U87 cells, normal or negative control groups. However, significant inhibition of glioma cell invasion was observed following transfection with miR-34c-3p and miR-34c-5p. Moreover, it was identified that miR-34c-3p overexpression reduced the expression of Notch pathway members, but miR-34c-5p overexpression did not. Therefore, these results suggest differential tumor suppressor roles for miR-34c-3p and miR-34c-5p and provide new insights into the role of miR-34c in glioma, which includes tumor-suppressing effects on proliferation, apoptosis and invasiveness.
