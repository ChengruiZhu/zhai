) is a form of artificial liver support that has the potential to remove substantial quantities of albumin-bound toxins that have been postulated to contribute to the pathogenesis of liver cell damage, haemodynamic instability and multi-organ failure in patients with acute liver failure (ALF) and acute-on-chronic liver failure (AoCLF). These toxins include fatty acids, bile acids, tryptophan, bilirubin, aromatic amino acids and nitric oxide. Data from controlled clinical trials are limited so far. One of two studies performed on small numbers of patients with AoCLF suggest a survival benefit, but no controlled data are available in the ALF setting. Our preliminary experience with MARS therapy, instituted late in the clinical course of five patients with severely impaired liver function, including three with AoCLF precipitated by sepsis and two with liver dysfunction due to sepsis in the absence of pre-existing chronic liver disease, indicates some clinical efficacy. However, the overall survival rate (1 of 5; 20%) remained poor. More data obtained from larger cohorts of patients enrolled in randomised controlled studies will be required in both the AoCLF and ALF settings to identify categories of liver failure patients who might benefit most from MARS treatment, to ascertain the most appropriate timing of intervention and to determine the overall impact on outcome, including cost-effectiveness.
