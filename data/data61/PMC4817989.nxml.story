Following embryo attachment to the uterine epithelium, the underlying decidualized stroma is critical for further invasion by the conceptus into the maternal compartment. Because endometrial decidualization is required early in the continuum of events that lead to a successful pregnancy, abnormal decidualization can contribute not only to implantation failure or early miscarriage, but may initiate adverse reproductive outcomes that manifest in subsequent pregnancy trimesters. Genome-wide transcriptional changes by progesterone are known to underlie decidualization; however, the pivotal signals that functionally enable progesterone-driven decidualization are not fully known. Using an integrative analysis of genome-scale data along with studies on primary human endometrial stromal cells (hESCs), we reveal that the promyelocytic leukemia zinc finger (PLZF) transcription factor is rapidly induced by progesterone, and its induction is essential for progesterone-dependent hESC decidualization. Although PLZF in turn governs a remarkable array of target genes in the hESC, we demonstrate that PLZF tightly regulates the expression level of the early growth response 1 (EGR1) transcription factor, the perturbation of which compromises progesterone dependent decidualization. Together, our findings provide a new mechanistic perspective on progesterone action in the uterus which may furnish new opportunities for the formulation of more effective fertility solutions in the future.
