The aim of the present study was to examine the expression and clinical significance of SOX2 in non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC). Immunohistochemistry was used to detect the expression level of SOX2 in 127 cases of NSCLC. The Chi-square test was used to analyze the association of SOX2 expression and clinicopathological factors in NSCLC and para-carcinoma tissues (2.5%). The Kaplan-Meier method was applied to plot the survival curve, and the log-rank test and COX multiple regression model were applied to determine survival. SOX2 showed a high expression in 35.4% NSCLC tissues, which was significantly higher than that of the para-carcinoma tissues. The expression level of SOX2 was not associated with gender, age, smoking history or TNM stage (P>0.05), but was significantly associated with the pathological type of carcinoma. The high expression rate of SOX2 in lung squamous cell carcinoma was 50% (25/50) and in lung adenocarcinoma was 20.3% (12/59). Survival analysis indicated that the prognosis of patients with a high SOX2 expression was significantly better than those with a low SOX2 expression. The COX multiple regression analysis revealed that the expression level of SOX2 was an independent prognostic factor of patients with NSCLC (P<0.001). In conclusion, the expression of SOX2 in NSCLC tissues was upregulated, which was associated with the pathological type of carcinoma, while a high SOX2 expression mainly occurred in lung squamous cell carcinoma.
