Fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated bovine serum albumin (FITC-BSA)-loaded polyethylene glycol (PEG)-modified liposomes and lipoparticles with high protein entrapment were developed. The lipid formula of the liposomes contained PEGylated lipids and unsaturated fatty acids for enhancing membrane fluidity and effective delivery into cells. The preparation techniques, lipid content, and PEG-modified lipoparticle ratios were evaluated. The PEG-modified lipoparticles prepared by ethanol injection extrusion (100 nm pore size) achieve a population of blank liposomes with a mean size of 125 ± 2.3 nm and a zeta potential of −12.4 ± 1.5 mV. The average particle size of the PEG-modified lipoparticles was 133.7 ± 8.6 nm with a zeta potential of +13.3 mV. Lipoparticle conformation was determined using transmission electron microscopy and field-emission scanning electron microscopy. The FITC-BSA encapsulation efficiency was dramatically increased from 19.0% for liposomes to 59.7% for lipoparticles. Sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) results confirmed the preparation process, and an 8-hour leaching test did not harm the protein structure. Once prepared, the physical and chemical stability of the PEG-modified lipoparticle formulations was satisfactory over 90 days. In vitro retention tests indicated that the 50% retention time for the protein-containing lipoparticles was 7.9 hours, substantially longer than the liposomes at 3.3 hours. A Caco-2 cell model was used for evaluating the cytotoxicity and cell uptake efficiency of the PEG-modified lipoparticles. At a lipid content below 0.25 mM, neither the liposomes nor the lipoparticles caused significant cellular cytotoxicity (
