Lichen planus (LP) is a chronic inflammatory disease of probable immune-based etiology. The pathogenesis of LP is unclear, but apoptotic changes in epidermal (epithelial) cells have been reported. Destruction of the basal cell layer is observed and many changes in cell proliferation, cell repair and cell death occur in the injured mucosal epithelium. The aim of this study was to evaluate and compare the expression of bax and bcl-2 in oral lichen planus (OLP), well differentiated oral squamous cell carcinoma (WOSCC) and normal mucosa. Sixty one paraffin-embedded biopsy including 11 cases of WOSCC, 30 cases of OLP (n=15 erosive OLP [OLP-E], n=15 reticular OLP [OLP-R]) and 20 normal mucosa were entered in our research. We used immunohistochemistry staining method for assessing bax and bcl-2 expression in epithelial layers. The percentage of stained cells was estimated in 5 randomized microscopic fields and classified as (-): 0%, (+) :< 10%, (++): 10-25%, (+++): 26-50%, (++++): > 50% positive cells. The data were analyzed with Mann-Whitney, Chi Square, and Kruskal-Wallis tests. Significant differences in bax expression were observed among OLP, WOSCC compared to normal mucosa (P=0.008). No significant difference in bax expression between OLP-E and OLP-R compared to WOSCC was seen (P>0.05). Bcl-2 was negative for all OLP and normal mucosa samples, and weak positivity was observed in WOSCC samples. According to the findings of our study, it may be possible to correlate the difference of bax and bcl-2 expression levels among the mentioned lesions to the malignant potential of OLP.
