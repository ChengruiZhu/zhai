microRNAs (miRNAs) are a class of small regulatory RNAs that fine-tune gene expression by reducing protein output from their target messenger RNAs and are implicated in myriad physiological and pathological processes. miRNAs are generated from long primary transcripts via sequential actions of the Drosha/Pasha and Dicer ribonucleases. Mature miRNAs are incorporated into the miRISC effector complexes that contain AGO family member proteins and serve as specificity determinants to guide miRISCs to their target RNAs. Previous studies suggested that select proteins implicated in the processing of messenger RNAs are required for the miRNA production/function, but the underlying molecular mechanism is not well understood. Here we show that SmD1, an essential protein implicated in the processing of messenger RNAs, directly interacts with both Pasha and primary miRNA transcripts and is required for optimal miRNA production. Furthermore, SmD1 associates with multiple components of the miRNA effector machinery and is required for miRNA function. Finally, our analysis reveals that defects in the miRNA pathway can be uncoupled from those in messenger RNA processing, and that the miRNA biogenesis and messenger RNA processing machineries are physically and functionally distinct entities. Our data thus suggests that SmD1 modulates the miRNA pathway independent of its role in messenger RNA processing.
