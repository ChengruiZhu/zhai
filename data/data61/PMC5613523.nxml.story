Diabetes complications and osteoporotic fractures are two of the most important causes of morbidity and mortality in older patients, and they share many features, including genetic susceptibility, molecular mechanisms, and environmental factors. Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) compromises bone microarchitecture by inducing abnormal bone cell function and matrix structure with increased osteoblast apoptosis, diminished osteoblast differentiation, and enhanced osteoclast-mediated bone resorption. The linkage between these two chronic diseases creates a possibility that certain antidiabetic therapies may affect bone function. The treatment of T2DM has been improved in the past two decades with the development of new therapeutic drugs. Each class has a pathophysiologic target related to the regulation of the energy metabolism and insulin secretion. However, both glycemic homeostasis and bone homeostasis are under the control of common regulatory factors. This background allows the individual pharmacological targets of antidiabetic therapies to affect bone quality due to their indirect effects on bone cell differentiation and the bone remodeling process. With a greater number of diabetic patients and antidiabetic agents being launched, it is critical to highlight the consequences of this disease and its pharmacological agents on bone health and fracture risk. Currently, there is little scientific knowledge approaching the impact of most anti-diabetic treatments on bone quality and fracture risk. Thus, this review aims to explore the pros and cons of the available pharmacologic treatments for T2DM on bone mineral density and risk fractures in humans.
