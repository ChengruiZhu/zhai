. 11. The way in which the inhibitory effect depends on the length of time during which inhibitor and lysin are in contact before the addition of the cells is not the same when plasma is used as an inhibitor as when a cholesterol sol is used as the inhibitor. The amount of cholesterol sol which is equal in inhibitory power to a given amount of plasma accordingly varies according to the length of the time of contact which is selected. 12. The inhibitory effect in systems containing saponin, plasma, and red cells can be shown to depend on the order in which the components are mixed, when the concentration of the plasma is small. 13. The question as to how much of the inhibitory power of plasma can be accounted for by the contained cholesterol (total or free) is one which can be answered only if the experimental conditions are defined with respect to initial concentration of lysin, time of contact, and several other variables. Very roughly, about 50 per cent of the total inhibition of plasma, or a little more, can be attributed to the cholesterol fraction. 14. Since the inhibitory effects of plasma are the result of reactions in the bulk phase of the system, complicated by redistributions among the phases, of reactions between some of its components and components of the red cell surface, and of enhancing effects of its components upon each other, it is not surprising that nothing better than an empirical expression should have been found to describe the inhibition quantitatively.
