Successive stamen movement directly controls pollen presentation schedules through sequential stamen maturation and changes the extent of herkogamy by altering the positions of sexual organs. However, the implications of such movements in terms of pollination are not well understood. Pollen presentation theory predicts that staggered pollen presentation should be favoured when plants are subject to diminishing returns on pollen transfer. Herkogamy on the other hand, has been interpreted as an adaptive trait that reduces sexual interference in hermaphrodite flowers. In this study, we conducted floral manipulations to determine the function of successive stamen movement in pollen transfer. By artificially manipulating the flowers to present two anthers simultaneously in the floral centre, we attempted to investigate whether changes in the anther presentation strategy affect pollen removal, deposition and the efficiency of pollinators. Compared with the natural treatment, the pollen transfer efficiency of halictid bees decreased significantly when the flowers were manipulated to present two anthers simultaneously. Although the presentation of two anthers simultaneously led to a similar pollen removal rate, there was a significant reduction in pollen deposition on neighbouring stigmas. To evaluate the effect of movement herkogamy on pollen export and deposition and seed set, the flowers were manipulated with or without the movement of stamen bending out from the floral centre. Pollen export decreased significantly when the central anther was moved away from the pistil, and pollen deposition and seed set declined significantly when the five spent anthers were retained on the pistil. Our study provides good support for the pollen presentation theory and provides direct experimental evidence that successive stamen movement could increase pollen transfer efficiency by sequential stamen maturation. Moreover, movement herkogamy promotes pollen export, deposition and seed set, and could therefore be regarded as an effective mechanism to reduce interference between male and female functions.
