The plant hormone abscisic acid (ABA) is critical to plant development and stress responses. The ABA signaling cascade is comprised of ABA receptors, negatively regulating PP2C protein phosphatases and transducing protein kinases. Biochemical assays have indicated that certain ABA receptors constitutively bind to and inhibit PP2C protein phosphatases even without ABA. This finding has suggested that leaky receptor signal transduction in the absence of ABA could occur. Small GTPases named ROPs are negative regulators of ABA signal transduction and maintain PP2C protein phosphatase activity. However, whether and how the ABA signal can remove the inhibition of ABA signaling by ROPs remains elusive. The GTP exchange factor, RopGEF1, is an activator of ROP small GTPases. We show that the subcellular localization of RopGEF1 rapidly changes in response to ABA. RopGEF1 is sequestered via the endosome-prevacuolar compartment pathway and is degraded. Interestingly, we have found that ABI1, a PP2C protein phosphatase, directly interacts with RopGEF1. Moreover, PP2Cs, which are active in the absence of ABA, protect the protein stability of RopGEF1. These findings point to a RopGEF1-ROP-ABI1 control loop model that could protect against leaky receptor signaling, and which facilitates ABA signal transduction when ABA is produced in response to stress.
