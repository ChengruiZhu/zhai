Brachial plexus block is effective with good postoperative analgesia in upper limb surgery has gained importance as it safe, low cost, and maintains stable hemodynamics intraoperatively. To decrease the onset time and prolong the duration of nerve block bicarbonate, opioids (morphine, fentanyl, etc.), sympathomimetic agents (epinephrine, phenylephrine, etc.), α-2 agonists (clonidine and dexmedetomidine), calcium channel blocker (verapamil), magnesium sulfate, etc., were studied with local anesthetics and their isomers. For their sedative, analgesic, perioperative sympatholytic, and cardiovascular stabilizing effects with reduced anesthetic requirements, α-2 adrenergic receptor agonists, such as more potent and highly selective dexmedetomidine, have been the focus of interest for regional anesthesia. Intravenous dexmedetomidine infusion resulted in significant opioid-sparing effects as well as a decrease in inhalational anesthetic requirements. Animal studies proved that dexmedetomidine enhances sensory and motor blockade along with increased duration of analgesia. In humans, dexmedetomidine has also shown to prolong the duration of block and postoperative analgesia when added to local anesthetic in various regional blocks. Bupivacaine, the widely used local anesthetic in regional anesthesia, is available in a commercial preparation as a racemic mixture (50:50) of its two enantiomers: levobupivacaine, S (−) isomer and dextrobupivacaine, R (+) isomer. Severe central nervous system and cardiovascular adverse reactions reported in the literature after inadvertent intravascular injection or intravenous regional anesthesia have been linked to the R (+) isomer of bupivacaine. The levorotatory isomers were shown to have a safer pharmacological profile with less cardiac and neurotoxic adverse effects. The decreased toxicity of levobupivacaine is attributed to its faster protein binding rate. The pure S (−) enantiomers of bupivacaine, i.e., ropivacaine and levobupivacaine were thus introduced into the clinical anesthesia practice. Such an increased usage mandates the documentation of evidence-based literature with regard to risk and safety concerns as well as clinical issues related to levobupivacaine. This study is designed to assess the efficacy of adding dexmedetomidine to levobupivacaine during placement of supraclavicular brachial plexus blockade.
