Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is one of the leading causes of death worldwide. In Greenland, valid estimates of prevalence and incidence of CVD do not exist and can only be calculated if diagnoses of CVD in the Greenlandic Hospital Discharge Register (GHDR) are correct. Diagnoses of CVD in GHDR have not previously been validated specifically. The objective of the study was to validate diagnoses of CVD in GHDR. The study was conducted as a validation study with primary investigator comparing information in GHDR with information in medical records. Diagnoses in GHDR were considered correct and thus valid if they matched the diagnoses or the medical information in the medical records. A total of 432 online accessible medical records with a cardiovascular diagnosis according to GHDR from Queen Ingrid’s Hospital from 2001 to 2013 (n=291) and from local health care centres from 2007 to 2013 (n=141) were reviewed. Ninety-nine and ninety-two percent of discharge diagnosis in GHDR from Queen Ingrid’s Hospital and local health care centres were correct in comparison with diagnoses in the medical record indicating valid registration practice. The correctness of cardiovascular diagnoses in GHDR was considered high in terms of acceptable agreement between medical records and diagnoses in GHDR. Cardiovascular diagnoses are valid for epidemiological use.
