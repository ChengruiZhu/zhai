 This study of the inhibitive effect of aniline and some of its derivatives and of the triphenylmethane dyes on certain bacteria warrants the following tentative conclusions: 1. The composition and reaction of the medium exert a marked influence on the behavior of the antiseptic. The higher the concentration of organic nitrogenous compounds (peptone) in the medium, the lower is the effective concentration of the dye. The reaction of the medium modifies the specific action of the antiseptic, owing probably to an alteration in the bacterial cell. 2. The germicidal action of the compounds is a function of the benzene nucleus, the added elements or radicals, their number, and, in the case of the dyes, probably the quinoid structure of the nucleus. 3. As far as tested, the increase in the number of alkyl radicals increases the antiseptic power. Methyl green is an interesting exception to this rule, for the change of one of the nitrogens to the quaternary salt is accompanied by an almost complete loss in inhibitive action. 4. The antiseptic power is enhanced to a greater extent by an ethyl than a methyl group, and the second alkyl produces a proportionately greater increase than the first. It appears that the relative position of the introduced group may be a factor in determining the relative improvement in the effectiveness of the compound. 5. The introduction of a methyl group in the nucleus consistently enhances the inhibitive action of the compound and its alkyl derivatives. This is evident from a comparison of the action of aniline and its derivatives with that of toluidine and its corresponding derivatives. 6. The simple aniline derivatives, as well as the dyes, are more toxic for the Gram-positive than the Gram-negative bacteria. Of the former,
