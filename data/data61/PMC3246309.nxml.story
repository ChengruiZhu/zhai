Oromandibular reconstruction resulting from resection of benign tumor, malignant cancer, osteomyelitic or osteoradionecrotic mandible remains a challenge for plastic surgeons today. At present, fibula osteocutaneous flap is the perhaps most commonly used technique for oromandibular reconstruction because of its potential for contouring, immediate dental implant placement, and favorable donor site morbidity. In this study, we review the history of oromandibular reconstruction, summarize the characteristics of different osteocutaneous flaps, offer surgical options of different osteocutaneous flaps, and provide reconstructive strategies for different locations of mandibular defects. Furthermore, we give a detailed description of various modifications in oromandibular reconstruction: (1) the myoosseous flap for lateral segmental defect repair may reduce donor site complication; (2) to improve the function of oral commissure in patients with obscure recipient vessels, we modify the fibula osteocutaneous flap with anterolateral thigh flap and combine the tensor fascia lata using one set of recipient vessel for composite oromandibular reconstruction; (3) to decrease the likelihood of neck infection and improve aesthetic result, we add the segmental soleus muscle to the fibula osteocutaneous flap to obliterate and augment submandibular dead space. Lastly, dental rehabilitation considerations associated with mandibular reconstruction have been given to help assist in surgical treatment planning.
