The
surface charge of water, which is important in a wide range
of chemical, biological, material, and environmental contexts, has
been a subject of lengthy and heated debate. Recently, it has been
shown that the highly efficient LEWIS force field, in which semiclassical,
independently mobile valence electron pairs capture the amphiproticity,
polarizability and H-bonding of water, provides an excellent description
of the solvation and dynamics of hydroxide and hydronium in bulk water.
Here we turn our attention to slabs, cylinders, and droplets. In extended
simulations with 1000 molecules, we find that hydroxide consistently
prefers the surface, hydronium consistently avoids the surface, and
the two together form an electrical double layer until neutralization
occurs. The behavior of hydroxide can largely be accounted for by
the observation that hydroxide moving to the surface loses fewer hydrogen
bonds than are gained by the water molecule that it displaces from
the surface. At the same time, since the orientation of the hydroxide
increases the ratio of dangling hydrogens to dangling lone pairs,
the proton activity of the exposed surface may be increased, rather
than decreased. Hydroxide also moves more rapidly in the surface than
in the bulk, likely because the proton donating propensity of neighboring
water molecules is focused on the one hydrogen that is not dangling
from the surface.
