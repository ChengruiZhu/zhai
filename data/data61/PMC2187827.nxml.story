The presence of positionally conserved amino acid residues suggests that the mouse proteins TCA3, P500, MIP1-alpha, MIP1-beta, and JE are members of a single gene family. These proteins are activation specific and can be expressed by both myeloid and lymphoid cells. MIP1- alpha/MIP1-beta and MCAF (the putative human homologue of JE) act as chemotactic and activating agents for neutrophils and macrophages, respectively. The functions of TCA3 and P500 are unknown. We have used interspecies somatic cell hybrids and recombinant inbred mouse strains to show that the genes encoding TCA3, MIP1-alpha, MIP1-beta, and JE (provisionally termed Tca3, Mip-1a, Mip-1b, and Sigje, respectively) map as a cluster on the distal portion of mouse chromosome 11 near the Hox-2 gene complex. DNA sequence analysis indicates that the P500 and TCA3 proteins are encoded by alternative splicing products of one genomic gene. Additionally, the genes encoding TCA3 and JE are found to be strikingly similar with respect to the positions of intron-exon boundaries. Together, these data support the model that the cytokines TCA3, P500, MIP1-alpha, MIP1-beta, and JE are encoded by a single cluster of related genes. The gene encoding IL-5 (Il-5), which acts as a T cell-replacing factor, a B cell growth factor, and an eosinophil differentiation factor, is also mapped to mouse chromosome 11.Il-5 maps approximately 25 cM proximal to the Tca-3 gene and appears tightly linked to a previously described gene cluster that includes Il-3, Il-4, and Csfgm. We discuss the potential relevance of the two cytokine gene clusters described here with particular attention to specific human hematologic malignancies associated with chromosomal aberrations at corresponding locations on human chromosomes 5 and 17.
