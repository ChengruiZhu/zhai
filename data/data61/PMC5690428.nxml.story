Thyroid hemiagenesis (TH) is a rare congenital anomaly that is usually asymptomatic. Functional disorders of the thyroid make the patient symptomatic. TH is usually and incidentally established during evaluation of patients with symptomatic thyroid pathology. We report the case of a patient of TH who became symptomatic with hyperactivity of the gland. The patient presented with signs and symptoms of thyrotoxicosis. Physical examination revealed asymmetric nodular goiter at the right lobe. Biochemical analysis established the diagnosis of hyperthyroidism. Ultrasound of the thyroid gland revealed the absence of the left lobe and a large, solitary hypoechoic solid nodule in the right lobe. Nuclear scan showed the absence of the left lobe and revealed a large, autonomous solitary nodule in the right lobe. The diagnosis was a toxic adenoma. After medical control of hyperthyroidism, the patient was surgically treated with hemithyroidectomy. We prescribed postoperative replacement medication with L-thyroxin. Hyperthyroidism makes TH cases symptomatic. Thyroid ultrasound and scintigraphy incidentally discover agenesis of one lobe during evaluation of thyrotoxicosis. Hemithyroidectomy, including the autonomous nodule, is the procedure of choice for patients with toxic adenoma. Hemithyroidectomy in TH cases technically becomes a total thyroidectomy with a need for postoperative thyroid replacement therapy.
