Aim of the present study was to analyze the oncological impact of 5-ALA fluorescence of cerebral metastases. A retrospective analysis was performed for 84 patients who underwent 5-ALA fluorescence-guided surgery of a cerebral metastasis. Dichotomized fluorescence behavior was correlated to the histopathological subtype and primary site of the metastases, the degree of surgical resection on an early postoperative MRI within 72 hours after surgery, the local in-brain-progression rate and the overall survival. 34/84 metastases (40.5%) showed either strong or faint and 50 metastases (59.5%) no 5-ALA derived fluorescence. Neither the primary site of the cerebral metastases nor their subtype correlated with fluorescence behavior. The dichotomized 5-ALA fluorescence (yes vs. no) had no statistical influence on the degree of surgical resection. Local in-brain progression within or at the border of the resection cavity was observed in 26 patients (30.9%). A significant correlation between 5-ALA fluorescence and local in-brain-progression rate was observed and patients with 5-ALA-negative metastases had a significant higher risk of local recurrence compared to patients with 5-ALA positive metastases. After exclusion of the 20 patients without any form of adjuvant radiation therapy, there was a trend towards a relation of the 5-ALA behavior on the local recurrence rate and the time to local recurrence, although results did not reach significance anymore. Absence of 5-ALA-induced fluorescence may be a risk factor for local in-brain-progression but did not influence the mean overall survival. Therefore, the dichotomized 5-ALA fluorescence pattern might be an indicator for a more aggressive tumor.
