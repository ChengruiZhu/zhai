Phenotypic plasticity is often an adaptation of organisms to cope with temporally or spatially heterogenous landscapes. Like other adaptations, one would predict that different species, populations, or sexes might thus show some degree of parallel evolution of plasticity, in the form of parallel reaction norms, when exposed to analogous environmental gradients. Indeed, one might even expect parallelism of plasticity to repeatedly evolve in multiple traits responding to the same gradient, resulting in integrated parallelism of plasticity. In this study, we experimentally tested for parallel patterns of predator-mediated plasticity of size, shape, and behavior of 2 species and sexes of mosquitofish. Examination of behavioral trials indicated that the 2 species showed unique patterns of behavioral plasticity, whereas the 2 sexes in each species showed parallel responses. Fish shape showed parallel patterns of plasticity for both sexes and species, albeit males showed evidence of unique plasticity related to reproductive anatomy. Moreover, patterns of shape plasticity due to predator exposure were broadly parallel to what has been depicted for predator-mediated population divergence in other studies (slender bodies, expanded caudal regions, ventrally located eyes, and reduced male gonopodia). We did not find evidence of phenotypic plasticity in fish size for either species or sex. Hence, our findings support broadly integrated parallelism of plasticity for sexes within species and less integrated parallelism for species. We interpret these findings with respect to their potential broader implications for the interacting roles of adaptation and constraint in the evolutionary origins of parallelism of plasticity in general.
