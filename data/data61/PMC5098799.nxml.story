Rif1 is a conserved eukaryotic protein implicated in regulation of both the temporal pattern of DNA replication initiation and the DNA damage response (DDR). We found that in budding yeast several of Rif1â€™s DDR-related phenotypes stem from its ability to interact with the Glc7/PP1 phosphatase and inhibit DNA replication initiation at the highly repetitive and highly transcribed rDNA locus. Each rDNA copy contains a potential replication origin flanked on one side by a proteinaceous replication fork barrier, a crucial player in rDNA array size maintenance. Additionally, the rDNA RFB ensures that replication proceeds in the same direction as transcription, thus presumably minimizing collisions between the replication and transcription machineries. Our results show that inhibition of rDNA origin firing by Rif1-Glc7/PP1 prevents the buildup of an excess of stalled forks within the rDNA locus, which can lead to genome instability and cell death. These findings highlight the challenges posed by the replication of repetitive loci, and in particular the need to limit DNA replication initiation events at such vulnerable regions. Our study may have important implications for metazoan genomes, which contain a much higher fraction of repetitive sequences than budding yeast. Finally, since tumor cells already exhibit elevated levels of replication stress, our results suggest that inhibition of systems that limit DNA replication initiation may jeopardize the viability of these cells and thus prove to be a useful therapeutic strategy.
