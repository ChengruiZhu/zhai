Amelogenesis imperfecta (AI) affects enamel on primary and permanent dentition. This hereditary disorder is characterized by loss of enamel, poor esthetics, and hypersensitivity. Functional and cosmetic rehabilitation is challenging with variety of treatment options. This report presents the treatment of an AI patient using conventional fixed dentures and discusses issues related to posttreatment complications and prosthetic treatment outcome after 1 year of follow-up. A 19-year-old male AI patient with impaired self-esteem presented with hypersensitive, discolored, and mutilated teeth. Clinical examination revealed compromised occlusion and anterior open-bite. After hygiene maintenance full-coverage porcelain-fused-to-metal fixed restorations were indicated and applied. At the end of the treatment acceptable functional and esthetic results could be achieved. However, nearly a year after treatment a gingival inflammation in the esthetic zone complicated the outcome. Insufficient oral hygiene was to be blamed. Tooth sensitivity present from early childhood in these patients may prevent oral hygiene from becoming a habit. The relaxation due to relieve of hypersensitivity after treatment makes oral hygiene learning difficult. Continuous oral hygiene maintenance motivation may be crucial for the success of the treatment of AI patients. Treatment of AI patients should be carefully planned and an acceptable risk-benefit balance should be established.
