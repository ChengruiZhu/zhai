Association analysis of multiple phenotypes will unravel the genetic pleiotropic structures of multiple phenotypes, provide a powerful tool for developing drug with fewer side effects. To increase the power of the tests for high dimensional association analysis of multiple phenotypes with next-generation sequencing data, a key issue is to develop novel statistics that can effectively extract informative internal representation and features from high dimensional data. However, the current paradigm of association analysis of multiple phenotypes does not efficiently utilize the rich correlation structure of the genotype and phenotype data. To shift the paradigm of association analysis from shallow multivariate analysis to comprehensive functional analysis, we proposed a new general statistical framework referred to as a quadratically regularized functional canonical correlation analysis (QRFCCA) for association test which explores rich correlation information in the genotype and phenotype data. Large-scale simulations demonstrate that the QRFCCA has a much higher power than that of the many existing statistics while retaining the appropriate type 1 errors. To further evaluate the new approach, the QRFCCA are also applied to the TwinsUK study with 46 traits and sequencing data. The results show that the QRFCCA substantially outperforms the other statistics.
