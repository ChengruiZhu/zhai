Health of marine mammal populations is often considered an indicator of overall marine ecosystem health and resilience, particularly in highly-impacted regions such as the Gulf of Mexico. Marine mammal populations are difficult to monitor given the many challenges of observing animals at sea (e.g. weather, limited daylight, ocean conditions, and expense). An increasingly common approach is the use of underwater acoustic sensors capable of recording marine mammal calls at remote locations for months at a time. Acoustic sensors generate large datasets in which dolphin echolocation clicks are commonly present. Dolphins are the most diverse family of marine mammals, and distinguishing click characteristics have only been described for a small subset of species. We developed a workflow to automatically identify distinct dolphin click types within large datasets without prior knowledge of their distinguishing features. Our algorithm then recognizes these click types in novel recording data across a range of monitoring locations. Known species-specific click types emerge from the data using this approach, as well as new click types potentially associated with additional species. This technique is a key step toward determining species identification for passive acoustic monitoring of offshore populations of dolphins and other toothed whales under a big data paradigm.
