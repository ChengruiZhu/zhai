) who participated in a, prospective, long-term evaluation. Measures included: six-minute walk test (6-MWT), STEEP treadmill test, Functional Assessment Cancer Therapy-General (FACT-G), Edmonton Symptom Assessment System (ESAS), Godin Leisure-Time Exercise Questionnaire, and exercise barriers survey. Analysis was performed using the paired t -test. Fifty-seven (55% of eligible cohort) CanWell participants (mean age= 60; 74% females) were included in this study. Post program changes included statistically significant reductions in total min on the treadmill and a trend towards improvements in 6-MWT distance. No significant changes were recorded in total FACT-G or ESAS score, however functional well-being approached statistical significant improvements. The most commonly reported exercise barriers included fatigue, cost, and return to work. While most participants (86%) believed they were able to exercise, only 63% reported being able to progress their exercise. These finding demonstrated that although CanWell graduates have substantial support from exercise specialists and most have early success with exercise, environment-related factors diminish long-term independent adherence to exercise. Providing cancer survivors with the skills needed to monitor and progress their exercise routines, or access to “tune-ups” may increase exercise adherence and maximize benefits.
