An automatic coronary artery tree labeling algorithm is described to identify the anatomical segments of the extracted centerlines from coronary computed tomography angiography (CCTA) images. This method will facilitate the automatic lesion reporting and risk stratification of cardiovascular disease. Three-dimensional (3D) models for both right dominant (RD) and left dominant (LD) coronary circulations were built. All labels in the model were matched with their possible candidates in the extracted tree to find the optimal labeling result. In total, 83 CCTA datasets with 1149 segments were included in the testing of the algorithm. The results of the automatic labeling were compared with those by two experts. In all cases, the proximal parts of main branches including LM were labeled correctly. The automatic labeling algorithm was able to identify and assign labels to 89.2% RD and 83.6% LD coronary tree segments in comparison with the agreements of the two experts (97.6% RD, 87.6% LD). The average precision of start and end points of segments was 92.0% for RD and 90.7% for LD in comparison with the manual identification by two experts while average differences in experts is 1.0% in RD and 2.2% in LD cases. All cases got similar clinical risk scores as the two experts. The presented fully automatic labeling algorithm can identify and assign labels to the extracted coronary centerlines for both RD and LD circulations.
