 (SBFA) to transfer the multipole charge density parameters, it is demonstrated that the crystal landscape can be quantified in terms of intermolecular interaction energies in the five crystal forms so far isolated in this complex system. There are five crystal forms. The first has an open, divergent O—H⋯N based structure with alternating orcinol and bipyridine molecules. The other four polymorphs have different three-dimensional packing but all of them are similar at an interaction level, and are based on a modular O—H⋯N mediated supramolecular synthon that consists of two orcinol and two bipyridine molecules in a closed, convergent structure. The SBFA method, which depends on the modularity of synthons, provides good agreement between experiment and theory because it takes into account the supramolecular contribution to charge density. The existence of five crystal forms in this system shows that polymorphism in cocrystals need not be considered to be an unusual phenomenon. Studies of the crystal landscape could lead to an understanding of the kinetic pathways that control the crystallization processes, in other words the valleys in the landscape. These pathways are traditionally not considered in exercises pertaining to computational crystal structure prediction, which rather monitors the thermodynamics of the various stable forms in the system, in other words the peaks in the landscape.
