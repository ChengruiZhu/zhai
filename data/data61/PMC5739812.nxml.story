Some studies have reported an association between the zinc-finger protein 350 (ZNF350), also known as zinc-finger and BRCA1-interacting protein with a Kruppel-associated box (KRAB) domain (ZBRK1), and risks of breast cancer, although the results remain controversial. A systematic search was conducted on PubMed, Web of Science, EMBASE, Ovid, Chinese National Knowledge Databases, and WanFang databases with relevant keywords. Four studies of five distinct populations involving 5824 breast cancer cases were used to conduct a meta-analysis that summarizes the current evidence of 5 genetic polymorphisms: Asp35Asp, Leu66Pro, Pro373Pro, Ser472Pro, and Ser501Arg in the ZNF350 gene. The T allele in Asp35Asp polymorphisms not significantly associated with increased risk of breast cancer (OR: 1.08; 95% CI: 0.96–1.21). The minor C allele of the Asp35Asp polymorphism is protective in the overdominant model (OR = 1.14; 95% CI: 1.02–1.28). The Pro allele in the Leu66Pro polymorphism is protective in all of the models examined (allelic, dominant, recessive, and overdominant). The Pro373Pro is not associated with breast cancer in all of the models tested. The Pro allele of the Ser472Pro polymorphism is protective using the dominant model (OR = 0.10; 95% CI: 0.04–0.23) but deleterious using the overdominant model (OR = 1.14; 95% CI: 1.02–1.28). The Ser501Arg polymorphism is deleterious only when using the recessive model (OR = 1.21; 95% CI: 1.02–1.44). In conclusion, this meta-analysis suggests that genetic polymorphisms in the
