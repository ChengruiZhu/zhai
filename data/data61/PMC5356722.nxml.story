The clinical significance and biological function of DEXD/H box helicase 60 (DDX60) in oral cancer remains unknown. Herein, we evaluated the association of DDX60 expression with tumorigenesis and the prognosis of oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC). DDX60 expression was examined by immunohistochemistry on tissue microarray slides of 494 OSCC patients, including 180 buccal mucosal SCC (BMSCC), 241 tongue SCC (TSCC), and 73 lip SCC (LSCC) patients. DDX60 expression was significantly increased in all three subsites of OSCC compared to its expression in tumor adjacent normal tissues. However, its association with tumorigenesis was specific to the oral cavity subsite after the stratification of betel quid chewing, smoking, and drinking. Among OSCC patients, higher levels of DDX60 expression were associated with the male gender, a well-differentiated tumor, advanced stage of disease, and a large tumor size with subsite specific features. LSCC patients with high DDX60 expression levels showed shorter disease-specific survival, particularly those with moderately or poorly differentiated tumors. Additionally, TSCC or OSCC patients with high DDX60 expression showed a poor disease-free survival (DFS), particularly those with moderately or poorly differentiated tumors. Therefore, DDX60 is a novel and unfavorable biomarker for tumorigenesis and prognosis of OSCC in a subsite-specific manner.
