T cell receptors (TCRs) play a major role in immunity, recognizing peptide antigens presented by major histocompatibility complex proteins. Due to their capacity to target intracellularly produced proteins and initiate cell killing, there is significant interest developing TCR-based therapeutic strategies, particularly towards cancer. A concern with TCRs is their weak-to-moderate affinities, which limits therapeutic potential. While in vitro evolution has been used to enhance TCR affinity, with sometimes spectacular results, these techniques can reduce peptide specificity and offer little control over affinity enhancements. Here we explored the use of structure-based computational design to enhance TCR affinity, which in principle can permit control over both specificity and affinity gains. We examined a clinically relevant TCR recently used in melanoma immunotherapy, identifying and characterizing mutations which enhanced affinity with no detectable impacts on binding specificity. We solved a crystal structure of our highest affinity designed TCR in complex with antigen, which indicated high accuracy of the structural modeling during the design process, and we critically evaluated several design protocols and functions to further improve design success. These results provide valuable insights into the use of computational design for TCRs. Lastly, the enhanced affinity variants identified may be of potential clinical benefit.
