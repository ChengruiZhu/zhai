Selenium compounds, such as diphenyl diselenide (DPDS), have been shown to exhibit biological activity, including antioxidant effects. However, the use of DPDS in pharmacology is limited due to in vivo pro-oxidative effects. In addition, studies have shown that DPDS-loaded nanocapsules (DPDS-NCS) have greater bioavailability than free DPDS in mice. Accordingly, the aim of this study was to investigate the antioxidant properties of DPDS-NCS in vitro and biological activity in mice. Our in vitro results suggested that DPDS-NCS significantly reduced the production of reactive oxygen species and Fe(II)-induced lipid peroxidation (LPO) in brain. The administration of DPDS-NCS did not result in death or change the levels of endogenous reduced or oxidized glutathione after 72 hours of exposure. Moreover, ex vivo assays demonstrated that DPDS-NCS significantly decreased the LPO and reactive oxygen species levels in the brain. In addition, the highest dose of DPDS-NCS significantly reduced Fe(II)- and sodium nitroprusside-induced LPO in the brain and Fe(II)-induced LPO in the liver. Also, Î´-aminolevulinate acid dehydratase within the brain was inhibited only in the highest dose of DPDS-NCS. In conclusion, our data demonstrated that DPDS-NCS exhibited low toxicity in mice and have significant antioxidant characteristics, indicating that nanoencapsulation is a safer method of DPDS administration.
