In eukaryotes, chromatin-based mechanisms overlay with DNA sequence information to determine the transcriptional output of the genome. Evaluating the role of chromatin state variations in the regulation of gene expression is therefore key to understanding their contribution to development. Several transcriptional coactivators contribute to the selective regulation of cellular pathways by coordinating histone H2B monoubiquitination (H2Bub) with other histone modifications. Although H2Bub is present on a large number of genes, its loss was shown to affect RNA levels for only a small subset of genes, and therefore its influence on gene expression is not well understood. Here we assessed the impact of H2Bub on expression changes during a rapid developmental transition that initiates upon exposure of plants to light. This revealed that H2Bub marking is highly dynamic in a genomic context. Furthermore, a large repertoire of light-responsive genes was impaired for rapid up- or downregulation, indicating that H2Bub is important for attaining appropriate expression levels. Regulatory factors and circadian clock components are well represented within the set of genes impacted by H2Bub dynamics for rapid changes in RNA levels, indicating that some genes whose mRNAs need tight and rapid control are particularly sensitive to chromatin-based mechanisms linked to H2Bub deposition.
