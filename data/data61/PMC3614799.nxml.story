 statistical software which was also used for analysis. Chi square was used to test relationship between variables. P value<0.05 was considered statistically significant. Results: There were a total of 5488 deliveries at the University of Port-Harcourt Teaching Hospital from January 2007 to December 2008. Of these, 5,310 were live births while 404 were perinatal deaths giving perinatal mortality rate of 73.6 per 1000 live births. Eighty eight (1.6%) of the mothers were eclamptic. Eight (9.1%) were booked, 80 (90.1%) were unbooked. The mean gestational age at delivery was 35.1 Â± 4.2 weeks. The main mode of delivery was by emergency caesarian section in 49 (55.7%) of the patients. Others were spontaneous vertex delivery (34.1%), assisted vaginal breech delivery (6.8%) and instrumental vaginal delivery (3.4%). Fifty four babies (61.4%) were admitted into the Special Care Baby Unit. Indications for admission include prematurity (n=23), low birth weight (n=10), severe birth asphyxia (n=12), neonatal jaundice (n=4) and neonatal sepsis (n=5). There were 37 perinatal deaths giving a perinatal mortality rate of 411 per 1000 live births. Of the mortalities, 19 were intrauterine foetal deaths, while 18 were early neonatal deaths. Causes of death include severe birth asphyxia (n=6), respiratory distress syndrome (n=4), prematurity (n=4), neonatal jaundice (n=1) and sepsis (n=3). Conclusion: Eclampsia is a major contributor of perinatal mortality and morbidity in Nigeria. Detection and appropriate management of preeclampsia is critical to reduce the risk of eclampsia.
