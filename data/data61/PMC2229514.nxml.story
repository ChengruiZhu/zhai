1.4 carries two negatively charged residues and has been implicated in voltage-dependent gating. We substituted cysteines into nine putative “high impact” sites along the complete length of D4/S3 and evaluated their accessibilities to extracellular sulfhydryl reagents. Only the four outermost substituted cysteines (L1433C, L1431C, G1430C, and S1427C) are accessible to extracellular sulfhydryl reagents. We measured the voltage-dependent modification rates of the two cysteines situated at the extreme ends of this accessible region, L1433C and S1427C. Independent of the charge on the sulfhydryl reagents, depolarization increases the reactivity of both of these residues. Thus, the direction of the voltage dependence is opposite to that expected for a negatively charged voltage sensor, namely an inward translational movement in response to depolarization. Intrinsic electrostatic potentials were probed by charged sulfhydryl reagents and were either negative or positive, respectively, near L1433C and S1427C. The magnitude of the electrostatic potential near S1427C decreases with depolarization, suggesting that the extracellular crevice next to it widens during depolarization. S1427C experiences 44% of the electric field, as probed by charged cysteine reagents. To further explore movements around D4/S3, we labeled cysteines with the photoactivatable cross-linking reagent benzophenone-4-carboxamidocysteine methanethiosulfonate and examined the effects of UV irradiation on channel gating. After labeling with this reagent, all accessible cysteine mutants show altered gating upon brief UV irradiation. In each case, the apparent insertion efficiency of the photoactivated benzophenone increases with depolarization, indicating voltage-dependent movement near the extracellular end of D4/S3.
