Network analyses of large-scale interactomes have been a great aid in advancing our understanding of cellular functioning and organization. Here, we examine one of the most basic and intensely-studied structure-to-function relationships observed in cellular networks: that between the number of interactions a protein has and its tendency to be essential. We develop a new computational framework to systematically analyze essential proteins within their cellular context by explicitly incorporating functional information. We apply this framework to the yeast interactome and demonstrate that the previously observed positive relationship between interaction degree and essentiality is largely due to intramodular interactions. Further, essentiality appears to be a modular property of protein complexes and not more broadly of biological processes. Within an essential complex, its essential proteins tend to have more interactions, especially intra-complex interactions, than its non-essential proteins. Finally, in a computationally inferred module-level interaction network, essential complexes and processes tend to have higher interaction degrees than their non-essential counterparts. In summary, we show a relationship between connectivity and essentiality not only at the protein level, but also within modules and at the module level, with complexes and processes that are essential tending to interact with many functional groups.
