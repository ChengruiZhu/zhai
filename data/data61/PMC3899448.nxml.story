, for unconjugated rotigotine showed no statistically significant differences between Japanese and Caucasian subjects. Values of concentration-dependent pharmacokinetic parameters were higher in female subjects; this difference was minimized after correction for body weight. A statistically significant difference between ethnic groups was observed for total rotigotine concentrations (total rotigotine = unconjugated rotigotine + conjugated rotigotine), with slightly lower values in Caucasians after correction for body weight and apparent dose. No relevant differences were observed between males and females. Inter-individual variability was high. The terminal half-life for unconjugated rotigotine was 5.3 h in Japanese subjects and 5.7 h in Caucasians; corresponding values for total rotigotine were 8.6 h and 9.6 h. Less than 0.1 % of the apparent dose was renally excreted as the parent compound. Renal elimination of total rotigotine covers 11.7 % of absorbed dose in Japanese subjects and 10.8 % of the absorbed dose in Caucasians, whereas the renal elimination via total despropyl rotigotine was 8.2 and 7.1 %, respectively. The corresponding values for total desthienylethyl rotigotine were 3.5 % in Japanese subjects and 4.2 % Caucasians. Most adverse events were mild in intensity and typical for dopamine agonists or for transdermal therapeutics.
