Retinal ischemic injuries play an important role in the pathogenesis of several eye disorders. Inflammation and oxidative stress are key players in ischemic injuries. Following retinal ischemia, vascular endothelial cells and leukocytes express several inflammatory adhesion receptors, such as selectins and cell adhesion molecules. P-selectin stimulates leukocyte recruitment to platelet aggregates and has an important role in vascular homeostasis and inflammatory leukocyte extravasation. Soluble P-selectin can be neuroprotective through competitive binding to the receptors of endogenous P-selectin molecules. Here, we demonstrate the neuroprotective effect of a recombinant P-selectin immunoglobin G (P-sel-IgG) chimeric fusion protein in a rat anterior ischemic optic neuropathy (rAION) model. rAION was induced by photodynamic therapy. P-sel-IgG treatment reduced optic nerve edema and stabilized the bloodâ€“optic nerve barrier (BONB) in the acute phase of rAION. Further, P-sel-IgG increased the retinal ganglion cell (RGC) survival rate, reduced RGC apoptosis, preserved visual function, maintained retinal nerve fiber layer thickness, and reduced macrophage infiltration in optic nerve tissue in the chronic phase (day 28). Increased NAD(P)H quinone dehydrogenase 1 (NQO1) and heme oxygenase 1(HO-1) expression levels, along with increased transcription factor Nrf2, suggesting an antioxidant role of P-sel-IgG via the Nrf2 signaling pathway. In conclusion, this study is the first to demonstrate that P-sel-IgG treatment promotes RGC survival by stabilizing the BONB and activating the Nrf2 signaling pathway in a rAION model.
