 C-139, reported in this study, is one of the high-laccase producers. In order to facilitate novel and more efficient biocatalytic process applications, there is a need for laccases with improved biochemical properties, such as thermostability or stability in broad ranges of pH. In this work, modifications of laccase isoforms by hydrophobization, hydrophilization, and polymerization were performed. The hydrophobized and hydrophilized enzyme showed enhanced surface activity and higher ranges of pH and temperatures in comparison to its native form. However, performed modifications did not appear to noticeably alter enzyme’s native structure possibly due to the formation of coating by particles of saccharides around the molecule. Additionally, surface charge of modified laccase shifted towards the negative charge for the hydrophobized laccase forms. In all tested modifications, the size exclusion method led to average 80 % inhibition removal for hydrophilized samples after an hour of incubation with fluoride ions. Samples that were hydrophilized with lactose and cellobiose showed an additional 90 % reversibility of inhibition by fluoride ions after an hour of concluding the reaction and 40 % after 24 h. The hydrophobized laccase showed higher level of the reversibility after 1 h (above 80 %) and 24 h (above 70 %) incubation with fluoride ions. The addition of ascorbate to laccase solution before a fluoride spike resulted in more efficient reversibility of fluoride inhibitory effect in comparison to the treatments with reagents used in the reversed sequence.
