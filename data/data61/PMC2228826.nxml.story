The ionic conductances in rat basophilic leukemia cells (RBL-2H3) and rat peritoneal mast cells were investigated using the patch-clamp technique. These two cell types were found to have different electrophysiological properties in the resting state. The only significant conductance of RBL-2H3 cells was a K+-selective inward rectifier. The single channel conductance at room temperature increased from 2-3 pS at 2.8 mM external K+ to 26 pS at 130 mM K+. This conductance, which appeared to determine the resting potential, could be blocked by Na+ and Ba2+ in a voltage-dependent manner. Rat peritoneal mast cells had a whole-cell conductance of only 10-30 pS, and the resting potential was close to zero. Sometimes discrete openings of channels were observed in the whole-cell configuration. When the Ca2+ concentration on the cytoplasmic side of the membrane was elevated, two types of channels with poor ion specificity appeared. A cation channel, observed at a Ca2+ concentration of approximately 1 microM, had a unit conductance of 30 pS. The other channel, activated at several hundred micromolar Ca2+, was anion selective and had a unit conductance of approximately 380 pS in normal Ringer solution and a bell-shaped voltage dependence. Antigenic stimulation did not cause significant changes in the ionic conductances in either cell type, which suggests that these cells use a mechanism different from ionic currents in stimulus-secretion coupling.
