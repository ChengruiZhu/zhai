With the advancement of genome research, it is becoming clear that genes are not distributed on the genome in random order. Clusters of genes distributed at localized genome positions have been reported in several eukaryotes. Various correlations have been observed between the expressions of genes in adjacent or nearby positions along the chromosomes depending on tissue type and developmental stage. Moreover, in several cases, their transcripts, which control epigenetic transcription via processes such as transcriptional interference and genomic imprinting, occur in clusters. It is reasonable that genomic regions that have similar mechanisms show similar expression patterns and that the characteristics of expression in the same genomic regions differ depending on tissue type and developmental stage. In this study, we analyzed gene expression patterns using the cap analysis gene expression (CAGE) method for exploring systematic views of the mouse transcriptome. Counting the number of mapped CAGE tags for fixed-length regions allowed us to determine genomic expression levels. These expression levels were normalized, quantified, and converted into four types of descriptors, allowing the expression patterns along the genome to be represented by character strings. We analyzed them using dynamic programming in the same manner as for sequence analysis. We have developed a novel algorithm that provides a novel view of the genome from the perspective of genomic positional expression. In a similarity search of expression patterns across chromosomes and tissues, we found regions that had clusters of genes that showed expression patterns similar to each other depending on tissue type. Our results suggest the possibility that the regions that have senseâ€“antisense transcription show similar expression patterns between forward and reverse strands.
