In this nationwide propensity score–matched study, we included patients with diabetes mellitus undergoing noncardiac surgery between 2000 and 2011 from Taiwan's National Health Insurance Research Database. Patients were classified as beta‐blocker and non–beta‐blocker cohorts. We further stratified beta‐blocker users into cardioprotective beta‐blocker (atenolol, bisoprolol, metoprolol, or carvedilol) and other beta‐blocker users. To investigate time of initiation of beta‐blocker use, initiation time was stratified into 2 periods (>30 and ≤30 days preoperatively). The outcomes of interest were in‐hospital and 30‐day mortality. After propensity score matching, we identified 50 952 beta‐blocker users and 50 952 matched controls. Compared with non–beta‐blocker users, cardioprotective beta‐blocker users were associated with lower risks of in‐hospital (odds ratio 0.75, 95% CI 0.68–0.82) and 30‐day (odds ratio 0.75, 95% CI 0.70–0.81) mortality. Among initiation times, only the use of cardioprotective beta‐blockers for >30 days was associated with decreased risk of in‐hospital (odds ratio 0.72, 95% CI 0.65–0.78) and 30‐day (odds ratio 0.72, 95% CI 0.66–0.78) mortality. Of note, use of other beta‐blockers for ≤30 days before surgery was associated with increased risk of both in‐hospital and 30‐day mortality.
