The BBSome is a protein complex that regulates ciliary trafficking in primary cilia, and mutations that impair BBSome function cause Bardet-Biedl Syndrome (BBS). BBS patients have retinal degeneration leading to blindness, but the disease pathophysiology has not been fully elucidated. In this study, we found that the BBSome is necessary for the structural organization of photoreceptor outer segments, and that the loss of different functional BBSome subunits causes outer segment malformation. Using a mouse model that allows the temporal inactivation of the BBSome, we inactivated BBSome function after the outer segment had formed normally. We found that the BBSome is required for both the initial formation and the continual maintenance of outer segment structures throughout life. In addition, using a mouse model that allows the temporal restoration of the BBSome, we restored BBSome function in immature photoreceptors and show that the malformed outer segment discs are displaced distally by normally formed outer segment structures. This finding indicates that when gene function is restored in immature retinas shortly after initial outer segment malformation, morphologically normal outer segments and a functionally normal retina can still result. This study has important implications for the timing of treatment of human retinal diseases.
