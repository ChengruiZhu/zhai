Aerobic glycolysis has been the most important hypothesis in cancer metabolism. It seems to be related to increased bioenergetic and biosynthetic needs in rapidly proliferating cancer cells. To this end, F-18 fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG), a glucose analog, became widely popular for the detection of malignancies combined with positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT). Although the potential roles of FDG PET/CT in primary tumor detection are not fully established, it seems to have a limited sensitivity in detecting early gastric cancer and mainly signet ring or non-solid types of advanced gastric cancer. In evaluating lymph node metastases, the location of lymph nodes and the degree of FDG uptake in primary tumors appear to be important factors affecting the diagnostic accuracy of PET/CT. In spite of the limited sensitivity, the high specificity of PET/CT for lymph node metastases may play an important role in changing the extent of lymphadenectomy or reducing futile laparotomies. For peritoneal metastases, PET/CT seems to have a poorer sensitivity but a better specificity than CT. The roles of PET/CT in the evaluation of other distant metastases are yet to be known. Studies including primary tumors with low FDG uptake or peritoneal recurrence seem suffer from poorer diagnostic performance for the detection of recurrent gastric cancer. There are only a few reports using FDG PET/CT to predict response to neoadjuvant or adjuvant chemotherapy. A complete metabolic response seems to be predictive of more favorable prognosis.
