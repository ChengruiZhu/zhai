Viruses evade immune surveillance in many ways, and if we understood the mechanisms underlying immune evasion better, it might be possible to develop targeted immune interventions to deal with viruses such as HIV-1. Here, the researchers investigate how natural killer (NK) cells, a type of lymphocyte that is an important component of the innate antiviral immune response, recognize HIV-infected cells and how HIV-1 evades NK-cell-mediated immune pressure. NK cell activation is determined by the integration of inhibitory and activating signals delivered to the cells by several different receptor families, including the family of killer-cell immunoglobulin-like receptors (KIRs). KIRs mainly bind to human leukocyte antigen (HLA) class I molecules (ligands) on their target cells. HLA class I proteins display fragments (epitopes; peptides recognized by the immune system) of pathogens present in infected cells on the cell surface so that the immune system knows that that cell needs destroying. The binding of distinct KIRs to HLA class I ligands depends on both the sequence of the HLA class I molecule and the sequence of the epitope presented by that HLA class I molecule. Thus, the researchers hypothesized that HIV-1 might evade NK-cell-mediated immune surveillance by acquiring mutations within epitopes presented by HLA class I molecules that enhance the engagement of inhibitory KIRs on NK cells, thereby inhibiting NK cell activity.
