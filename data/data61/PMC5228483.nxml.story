Apollon, namely baculoviral inhibitor of apoptosis proteins (IAP) repeat containing 6, is an unusually large member of the IAP family, and may be important in oncogenesis. The aim of the present study was to assess the association between renal carcinoma (RC) and Apollon expression, and to highlight the link between Apollon expression and the occurrence, development and prognosis of RC. Apollon expression was detected by immunohistochemistry, western blotting and reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction in RC tissues, adjacent non-cancerous tissues and paired normal tissues, respectively, in order to analyze the association between Apollon expression and clinicopathological features of RC. Kaplan-Meier survival estimate was used to assess the prognostic significance. It was observed that Apollon expression was higher in carcinoma tissues than in adjacent non-cancerous tissues and normal control tissues at the protein and messenger RNA level (P<0.001). There was a significant difference in T-stage (P=0.006), nodal involvement (P=0.007) and tumor-node-metastasis-stage (P=0.035) in patients categorized according to different Apollon expression levels. A prognostic significance of Apollon was also identified by the Kaplan-Meier method. The results of the present study indicate that Apollon expression is associated with the biological characteristics of renal cancer, and is potentially a valuable predictor and novel target for RC.
