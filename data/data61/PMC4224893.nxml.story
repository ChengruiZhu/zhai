, and 75% had previous AIDS. At the diagnosis of neoplasia, 17 were on protease inhibitors and 4 with efavirenz. Ten patients had a non-HIV-related cancer (three breast, two pancreatic, one Ewing sarcoma, one myeloblastic leukemia, one melanoma, one parotid adenocarcinoma, one lung), and 18 had an HIV-related cancer (nine non-Hodgkin lymphoma, seven Hodgkin disease, two anal). Overall, 43% of patients received more than one line of chemotherapy, including antimetabolites in 12 patients (5-FU, capecitabine, methotrexate, gemcitabine), alkylating agents in 12 cases (ciclophosphamide, iphosphamide), vinca alkaloids in 20 patients (vincristine, vinblastine, vindesine), antitumor antibiotics in 16 cases (adriamycin), cisplatin o carboplatin in six and monoclonal antibodies in six patients (rituximab, trastuzumab, cetuximab). Six patients modified the doses of antineoplastic agents due to toxicity (four neutropenia), not related to raltegravir. During a median follow up of 12.7 patients-year in concomitant therapy, there was only 1 case of virological failure and no patient discontinued raltegravir. Plasma concentrations of raltegravir in eight patients showed a median concentration of 143 ng/mL (79â€“455). Four patients (14%) died during the study, not related to AIDS progression. Raltegravir was continued after chemotherapy in all the cases.
