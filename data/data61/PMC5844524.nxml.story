A signaling pathway is a network of molecules in a cell that is typically initiated by stimuli (e.g., microenvironmental cues) acting on receptors and internal signaling molecules to determine cell fate. Signaling pathways in cancer cells are different from those in normal cells, and this difference helps cancer cells to grow and thrive indefinitely. Drugs that target the aberrant signaling pathways in cancer cells (often referred to as targeted therapy) are promising for improving treatment outcomes of many different cancers in patients. However, most patients eventually develop resistance to these drugs. Resistance may already be present in the tumor or may emerge via mutation or via microenvironmental mediation. Tumor heterogeneity, which is characterized by subtle or dramatic differences among tumor cells, plays a key role in the development of drug resistance. Some tumor cells respond well to therapy, while others may adapt to the stress induced by the drug within the microenvironment. Moreover, removal of drug-sensitive cells may result in the competitive release of drug-resistant cells. Here, we present mathematical models to assess the impact of heterogeneity in signaling pathways within tumor cells on the outcomes of targeted therapy. We consider a simplified version of two well-known signaling pathways that modulate the growth of lung cancer cells. By using different targeted therapies, we quantify the effect of pathway inhibition on protein activity and cell viability and developed a mathematical model of the network, which is trained to reproduce these data and to develop a panel of heterogeneous in silico cells. The model predicts potential mechanisms of drug resistance and proposes combination therapies that are effective across the panel. We validate these combination therapies experimentally using the lung cancer cells and integrated the in silico cells into a computational lung tissue model that explicitly captures the microenvironment of lung cancer. Our results suggest that heterogeneity in both the tumor and microenvironment impacts treatment response in different ways and suggest a novel combination therapy for a better response.
