The present study aims to investigate the expression levels of two critical mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) downstream effectors, 4E binding protein 1 (4EBP1) and eukaryotic initiation factor 4E (eIF4E) proteins, in precancerous squamous intraepithelial lesions and cancer of the uterine cervix, and their association with human papilloma virus (HPV) infection status. Uterine cervical biopsies from 73 patients were obtained, including 40 fresh-frozen samples and 42 archival formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue specimens. Whole protein extracts were analyzed for the expression of 4EBP1 and eIF4E proteins using western blotting. In addition, distribution of 4EBP1 and eIF4E protein expression and 4EBP1 phosphorylation (P-4EBP1) were analyzed by immunohistochemistry in archival tissues and correlated with the degree of dysplasia. The presence of high-risk HPV (HR-HPV) types was assessed by polymerase chain reaction. Using western blot analysis, high expression levels of 4EBP1 and eIF4E were observed in all uterine cervical carcinomas, which significantly correlated with the degree of dysplasia. By immunohistochemistry, overexpression of 4EBP1 and eIF4E was detected in 20 of 21 (95%) and 17 of 21 (81%) samples, respectively, in patients with high-grade dysplasia and carcinomas, compared with 1 of 20 (5%) and 2 of 20 (10%) samples, respectively, in patients with low-grade lesions or normal histology. All 4EBP1-positive cases tested were also positive for P-4EBP1. Furthermore, overexpression of 4EBP1 and eIF4E significantly correlated with the presence of HR-HPV oncogenic types. The present study demonstrated that critical effectors of mTOR signaling, which control protein synthesis initiation, are overexpressed in cervical high-grade dysplasia and cancer, and their levels correlate with oncogenic HPV types. These findings may provide novel targets for investigational therapeutic approaches in patients with cancer of the uterine cervix.
