Other cancers included colorectal (2/31 [6%]) and prostate cancer (1/31 [3%]). In all five deceased patients, cancer was the cause of death. There were four acute presentations with an aggressive glioma, Burkitt's lymphoma, an undiagnosed primary lung malignancy and a late diagnosed cervical cancer. The fifth patient died following the recurrence of a transitional cell cancer of the bladder after an initial diagnosis of seven years earlier.
