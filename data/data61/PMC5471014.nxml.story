Human papillomavirus (HPV) infections predict mortality in Taiwanese patients with oral cavity squamous cell carcinoma (OCSCC). To address their prognostic significance for local recurrence (LR), in this retrospective cohort study we investigated different serologic and molecular markers of HPV 16 infection in 85 consecutive patients with primary OCSCC who received standard treatment and had their sera stored before treatment. Resected tumor specimens were examined with PCR-based assays for HPV 16 E6/E7 mRNA expression. Sera were tested with suspension arrays for the presence of HPV-specific antibodies using synthetic L1 and E6 peptides as well as a synthetic E7 protein. HPV 16 E6/E7 mRNA, anti-L1, anti-E6, and anti-E7 antibodies tested positive in 12%, 25%, 38%, and 41% of the study patients, respectively. Multivariate analysis identified pathological T3/T4, E6/E7 mRNA, and anti-E7 antibodies as independent risk factors for LR, whereas anti-E6 antibodies were an independent protective factor. In patients with ≥ 3 (high-risk group), 2 (intermediate-risk), and ≤ 1 (low-risk) independent risk factors (predictors), the 5-year LR rates were 75%, 42%, and 4%, respectively. Results were validated in an independent cohort. Together, our preliminary data indicate that HPV 16 infections as well as low and high serum levels of anti-E6 and anti-E7 antibodies, respectively, can serve as biomarkers of LR in patients with OCSCC, whereas the clinical usefulness of anti-HPV 16 antibodies for risk stratification of newly diagnosed cases deserves further scrutiny.
