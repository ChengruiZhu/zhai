The benefit of non-genetic variation in phenotypic traits is debated. We show that the partitioning of damage by a mother bacterium to its two daughters is a variable trait that provides an advantage by generating fitness variation. Present day bacteria partition asymmetrically more damage to the old daughter, the one receiving the mother’s old pole. By modeling damage partitioning in a population, we find that the asymmetry is advantageous because it increases fitness variation and hence the efficiency of natural selection. However, our model also shows that symmetrical but randomly variable partitioning can be similarly beneficial. To examine why bacteria evolved asymmetry, we modeled the effect of damage anchored to the mother’s old pole. While anchored damage strengthens selection for asymmetry by creating additional fitness variation, it has the opposite effect on symmetry. Thus, symmetrical but randomly variable partitioning may have been sufficient to protect early bacteria from damage. However, natural selection then supplanted it with a genetically controlled mechanism in the form of asymmetrical partitioning. The change from random to genetic control is an important evolutionary transition that is poorly characterized. We are able to quantify this transition because our model estimates the costs and benefits of fitness variation.
