The Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC) is a transgenerational
prospective observational study investigating influences on health and development across
the life course. It considers multiple genetic, epigenetic, biological, psychological,
social and other environmental exposures in relation to a similarly diverse range of
health, social and developmental outcomes. Recruitment sought to enrol pregnant women in
the Bristol area of the UK during 1990–92; this was extended to include additional
children eligible using the original enrolment definition up to the age of 18 years. The
children from 14 541 pregnancies were recruited in 1990–92, increasing to
15 247 pregnancies by the age of 18 years. This cohort profile describes the index
children of these pregnancies. Follow-up includes 59 questionnaires (4 weeks–18
years of age) and 9 clinical assessment visits (7–17 years of age). The resource
comprises a wide range of phenotypic and environmental measures in addition to biological
samples, genetic (DNA on 11 343 children, genome-wide data on 8365 children,
complete genome sequencing on 2000 children) and epigenetic (methylation sampling on 1000
children) information and linkage to health and administrative records. Data access is
described in this article and is currently set up as a supported access resource. To date,
over 700 peer-reviewed articles have been published using ALSPAC data.
