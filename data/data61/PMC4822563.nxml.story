, 11696–11704]. The T-to-R transition is correlated with the conformation of the key loop L2, which in the T form becomes ‘disengaged’ and unable to participate in the catalytic mechanism. The T states of both isoforms are very similar, with a small twist of the upper dimer relative to the lower dimer. It is shown that at variance with the well studied R form of the liver enzyme, which is flat, the R form of the muscle enzyme is diametrically different, with a perpendicular orientation of the upper and lower dimers. The crystal structure of the muscle-isozyme R form shows that in this arrangement of the tetramer completely new protein surfaces are exposed that are most likely targets for the interactions with various cellular and enzymatic partners. The cruciform R structure is stabilized by a novel ‘leucine lock’, which prevents the key residue, Asp187, from locking loop L2 in the disengaged conformation. In addition, the crystal structures of muscle FBPase in the T conformation with and without AMP strongly suggest that the T-to-R transition is a discrete jump rather than a shift of an equilibrium smooth transition through multiple intermediate states. Finally, using snapshots from three crystal structures of human muscle FBPase, it is conclusively demonstrated that the AMP-binding event is correlated with a β→α transition at the N-terminus of the protein and with the formation of a new helical structure.
