Our senses, working together, enable us to interact with the environment. To obtain a unified percept of the world, diverse sensory inputs need to be bound together within distributed but strongly interconnected neuronal networks. Many multisensory abilities emerge or mature late in life, long after the maturation of the individual senses, yet the factors and mechanisms controlling their development are largely unknown. Here, we provide evidence for the critical role of unisensory experience during early postnatal life for the development of multisensory integration. Focusing on visual-tactile interactions in pigmented rats with good visual acuity, we show that a transient reduction of tactile inputs during neonatal development leads to sparser direct connections between adult primary visual and somatosensory cortices. As a result, these animals showed reduced neuronal activation following co-occurring tactile and visual stimuli, as well as impaired communication within visual-somatosensory networks. The structural and functional deficits resulting from an early manipulation of tactile experience had major behavioral consequences, impairing the ratsâ€™ ability to transfer information about encountered objects between senses. Thus, unisensory experience during early development shapes the neuronal networks of multisensory processing and the ability to transfer cross-modal information.
