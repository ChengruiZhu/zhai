Intestinal ischemia reperfusion (IR) injury is a critical problem, which can cause intestinal injury locally and acute lung injury (ALI) distally by inflammatory responses and oxidative stress. Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) is involved in innate immune and inflammatory responses. This study was to determine whether TLR4 mutant can attenuate intestinal and lung injuries after intestinal IR. Wild type (WT) and TLR4 mutant mice were submitted to intestinal IR by occluding the superior mesenteric artery. Histological assessment of the intestine and the lung were conducted by HE staining. The levels of proinflammatory cytokines, oxidative stress markers, apoptotic index and other mediators were measured. In addition, a 24-hour survival study was performed. Histological assessment showed that intestinal IR caused serious injuries in the intestine and the lung, corroborated by increased proinflammatory cytokines in the circulation. TLR4 mutant suppressed the histological injuries as demonstrated by significantly decreased pathological scores. Consistent with the morphological results, the TLR4 mutant mice exhibited remarkably lowered cytokine expressions in the intestine (TNF-α, IL-6, IL-1β, and NF-κB) and the lung (NO, iNOS, MCP-1, MIP-2, NF-κB, and Caspase-3). ALT and creatinine were also significantly dampened in the liver and kidney, respectively. Furthermore, the survival rate over the course of 24 hours was significantly improved. Collectively, the findings reveal that TLR4 mutant significantly abated the intestinal IR injury and ALI at least in part by alleviating the inflammatory response and oxidative stress.
