Timing of biological processes such as gene transcription is crucial to ensure that cells and tissues respond appropriately to their environment. Until recently it was assumed that most cells in a tissue responded in a similar way, and that changes in cellular activity were relatively stable. However, studies of messenger RNA and protein levels in single cells have shown the presence of considerable heterogeneity. This suggested that transcription in single cells may be highly dynamic over time. Using a combined experimental and theoretical approach, with time-lapse imaging of reporter gene expression over 25 h periods, we measured the rate of prolactin gene transcription in single pituitary cells and detected clear cycles of transcriptional activity. Mathematical analysis, using a binary model that assumed transcription was on or off, showed that these cycles were characterized by a minimum refractory period that involved chromatin remodeling. The timing of transcription from two different reporter constructs driven by identical promoters in the same cell was out-of-phase, suggesting that the pulses of gene expression are due to processes intrinsic to expression of a particular gene and not to environmental effects. We further show that the pulses of transcription are independent chromatin cycles at each gene locus. Therefore, heterogeneous patterns of gene expression may facilitate flexible transcriptional responses in cells within intact tissue, while maintaining a well-regulated average level of gene expression in the resting state.
