Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) is described as glucose intolerance diagnosed during pregnancy. Increased oxidative stress has implicated in diabetic problems. The aim of the current study was to compare antioxidant capacity and antioxidant nutrient intake between women with GDM (n = 40) and healthy pregnant women (n = 40). Demographic and obstetrics data were completed using interview technique and dietary intakes by using a semi-quantitative food frequency questionnaire (FFQ) with 168 items. The total antioxidant capacity (TAC) of serum was assessed by double-antibody sandwich enzyme-linked immune-sorbent assay (ELISA) method. Multivariate logistic regression was performed to compare independent variables and other potential risk factors between 2 groups. The results showed that TAC concentration of serum in women with GDM was significantly lower than in healthy pregnant women (2.3 ± 0.7 vs. 3.7 ± 0.1 µmol/L, p < 0.001). Intakes of vitamin E (11.8 + 3.1 vs. 16.2 + 3.1 mg, p < 0.001), selenium (81 ± 26 vs. 95 ± 36 µg, p < 0.05) and zinc (7.4 ± 1.9 vs. 9.1 ± 1.7 mg, p < 0.001) were significantly lower in women with GDM as compared to healthy pregnant women. In contrast, the groups showed no significant difference in vitamin C, β-carotene, selenium, fruit, and vegetable intake. Our findings showed that antioxidant capacity is lower in women with GDM, possibly related to lower intakes of vitamin E and zinc.
