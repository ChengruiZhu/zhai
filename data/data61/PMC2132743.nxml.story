γ-Tubulin is a universal component of microtubule organizing centers where it is believed to play an important role in the nucleation of microtubule polymerization. γ-Tubulin also exists as part of a cytoplasmic complex whose size and complexity varies in different organisms. To investigate the composition of the cytoplasmic γ-tubulin complex in mammalian cells, cell lines stably expressing epitope-tagged versions of human γ-tubulin were made. The epitope-tagged γ-tubulins expressed in these cells localize to the centrosome and are incorporated into the cytoplasmic γ-tubulin complex. Immunoprecipitation of this complex identifies at least seven proteins, with calculated molecular weights of 48, 71, 76, 100, 101, 128, and 211 kD. We have identified the 100- and 101-kD components of the γ-tubulin complex as homologues of the yeast spindle pole body proteins Spc97p and Spc98p, and named the corresponding human proteins hGCP2 and hGCP3. Sequence analysis revealed that these proteins are not only related to their respective homologues, but are also related to each other. GCP2 and GCP3 colocalize with γ-tubulin at the centrosome, cosediment with γ-tubulin in sucrose gradients, and coimmunoprecipitate with γ-tubulin, indicating that they are part of the γ-tubulin complex. The conservation of a complex involving γ-tubulin, GCP2, and GCP3 from yeast to mammals suggests that structurally diverse microtubule organizing centers such as the yeast spindle pole body and the animal centrosome share a common molecular mechanism for microtubule nucleation.
