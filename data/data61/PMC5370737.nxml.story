In this study we reported the early clinical and functional results of 40 patients admitted to our hospital for anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction (20 with autogenous hamstring tendon graft and 20 with peroneus longus allograft)retrospectively between august 2012 and september 2014. All patients in the autograft group were male and only three patients in the allograft group were female. The mean age in the autograft group was 29,60±4,55 and 34,25±6,73 in the allograft group. The mean time period before the surgery was 10,35(1-84) months and the mean postoperative follow up time was 33,8(12-46) months. Only 2 patients in the autograft group and 4 patients in the allograft group were injured by direct trauma. We noted the patients’ occupation, activity level and sport activities. Joint effusion, pain and restriction in the joint motion were documented. Patients were evaluated with Lachman, anterior drawer and pivot shift tests at the last follow up examination. The joint instability was tested with KT 1000 and the muscle contractions were tested with Cybex devices. Modified Cincinnati, Lysholm and IKDC activity scale were used to evaluate the activity level of patients. There were no difference neither clinically, nor functionally between two groups at the last follow up (p>0,05).Taken into consideration the risks and advantages of autogenous hamstring graft and allograft use we conclude that the peroneus longus allograft is a reasonable option for anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction.
