Asymmetric membrane currents and calcium transients were recorded simultaneously from cut segments of frog skeletal muscle fibers voltage clamped in a double Vaseline-gap chamber in the presence of high concentration of EGTA intracellularly. An inward phase of asymmetric currents following the hump component was observed in all fibers during the depolarization pulse to selected voltages (congruent to -45 mV). The average value of the peak inward current was 0.1 A/F (SEM = 0.01, n = 18), and the time at which it occurred was 34 ms (SEM = 1.8, n = 18). A second delayed outward phase of asymmetric current was observed after the inward phase, in those experiments in which hump component and inward phase were large. It peaked at more variable time (between 60 and 130 ms) with amplitude 0.02 A/F (SEM = 0.003, n = 11). The transmembrane voltage during a pulse, measured with a glass microelectrode, reached its steady value in less than 10 ms and showed no oscillations. The potential was steady at the time when the delayed component of asymmetric current occurred. ON and OFF charge transfers were equal for all pulse durations. The inward phase moved 1.4 nC/microF charge (SEM = 0.8, n = 6), or about one third of the final value of charge mobilized by these small pulses, and the second outward phase moved 0.7 nC/microF (SEM = 0.8, n = 6), bringing back about half of the charge moved during the inward phase. When repolarization intersected the peak of the inward phase, the OFF charge transfer was independent of the repolarization voltage in the range -60 to -90 mV. When both pre- and post-pulse voltages were changed between -120 mV and -60 mV, the equality of ON and OFF transfers of charge persisted, although they changed from 113 to 81% of their value at -90 mV. The three delayed phases in asymmetric current were also observed in experiments in which the extracellular solution contained Cd2+, La3+ and no Ca2+. Large increases in intracellular [Cl-] were imposed, and had no major effect on the delayed components of the asymmetric current. The Ca2+ transients measured optically and the calculated Ca2+ release fluxes had three phases whenever a visible outward phase followed the inward phase in the asymmetric current. Several interventions intended to interfere with Ca release, reduced or eliminated the three delayed phases of the asymmetric current.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)
