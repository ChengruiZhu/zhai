From fisheries and forestries to game parks and gut microbes, managing a community of organisms is much like managing a portfolio. Managers care about diversity, and calculations of risk—for extinction or financial ruin—require accurate models of the covariance between the parts of the portfolio. To model the covariances in portfolios or communities which may have some direct or diffuse competition over limiting resources, it helps to start simple with a null model assuming the equivalence of species or companies relative to one another (termed “neutrality”) and then testing whether or not the data suggest otherwise. Researchers in biology and finance have independently entertained and tested neutral models, but the existing tests have used snapshots of communities or the variance of fluctuations of individual populations, whereas tests of the covariances between species can better inform the development of alternative models. We develop a covariance-based neutrality test for time-series data and use it to show that the human microbiome, North American birds, and companies in the S&P 500 all have a similar deviation from neutrality. Understanding and incorporating this non-neutral covariance structure can yield more accurate alternative models of community dynamics which can improve our management of “portfolios” of multi-species systems.
