The embryonic cardiomyocyte cell line H9C2 is commonly used in numerous in vitro studies, including cardiotoxicity analyses of new drugs. So far no results were published for studies on cell parameters variability during the cell line ageing process. For this reason the aim of the study was to evaluate the effect of a number of H9C2 rat embryonic cardiomyocytes passages on repeatability of study results for selected cytotoxicity parameters, with doxorubicin as a model toxic agent. The cultures were passaged twenty-five times. Cells from passage 1, 5, 10, 15, 20 and 25 were treated with doxorubicin for 24 h. Then drug cytotoxicity was evaluated with the MTT test and additionally the nuclear factor erythroid 2–related factor (Nrf2) gene expression was examined. The analysis of oxidative stress intensity and cell morphology was also assessed. The microscopic appearance of cells indicates that untreated cardiomyocytes morphology changes as well as sensitivity to toxic effects increases with the number of passages. Also an increase in oxidative stress in cells occurs with further passaging of cardiomyocytes. Statistical significance of differences in conducted tests results depended on doxorubicin concentration but in many cases the H9C2 line was found to be a reliable in vitro model only for the first five passages. For this reason it is important to take into consideration that further culturing of cardiomyocytes may not ensure repeatability of study results due to the culture ageing.
