A major goal in biomedical research is to identify sets of genes (or “biological signatures”) associated with patient survival, as these genes could be targeted to aid in diagnosing and treating disease. A major challenge in using prognostic associations to identify biologically informative signatures is that in some diseases, “random” gene sets are associated with prognosis. To address this problem, we developed a new method called “Significance Analysis of Prognostic Signatures” (or “SAPS”) for the identification of biologically informative gene sets associated with patient survival. To test the effectiveness of SAPS, we use SAPS to perform a subtype-specific meta-analysis of prognostic signatures in large breast and ovarian cancer meta-data sets. This analysis represents the largest of its kind ever performed. Our analyses show that only a small subset of the gene sets found statistically significant using standard measures achieve significance by SAPS. We identify new prognostic signatures in breast and ovarian cancer and their corresponding molecular subtypes, and we demonstrate a striking similarity between prognostic pathways in ER negative breast cancer and ovarian cancer, suggesting new shared therapeutic targets for these aggressive malignancies. SAPS is a powerful new method for deriving robust prognostic biological pathways from clinically annotated genomic datasets.
