The present study describes the qualitative reactions of a xenogeneic anti-idiotype (Id) antiserum produced in a mouse-gamma-globulin- tolerant rabbit (5,936) against B6 anti-CBA IgG antibodies. The results showed that such an anti-Id antiserum reacts specifically against anti- H-2k antibodies and against H-2k alloantigen-activated T cells from the following pairs of congenic mice: B10 (H-2b) and B10.D2 (H-2d); and A.BY (H-2b) and A.SW (H-2s), but not against C3H.SW (H-2b) and C3H.OH (H-2o); and BALB/b (H-2b) and BALB/c (H-2d). CB 20 (BALB/c mice with the Ig-1b allotype) anti-CBA T blasts also express idiotypic determinants that react with rabbit 5,936 antiserum. Thus, positive reactions are obtained between rabbit 5,936 anti-Id antiserum and anti- H-2k IgG preparations and T blasts from mice carrying the Ig-1b or Ig- 1e allotype, but not from mice carrying the Ig-1a allotype. These reactions are qualitatively independent of the H-2 genotype of the Id- producing mice. Such a finding strongly suggests that the Id-bearing receptor molecules on mouse T cells are coded for by genes that are associated with the Ig heavy-chain-linkage group and not to the mouse histocompatibility complex. Furthermore, the anti-Id antibodies studied react preferentially against anti-H-2k antibodies or T cells with specificity toward the IAk-region-associated serological specificities. Thus, genes associated with the Ig heavy-chain-linkage group seem to be structural genes for at least T-cell receptors with specificity for IA- region-coded membrane antigens.
