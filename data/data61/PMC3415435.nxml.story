Drug-drug interactions are a common cause of adverse drug events. In this paper, we developed an automated search algorithm which can predict new drug interactions based on published literature. Using a large electronic medical record database, we then analyzed the correlation between concurrent use of these potentially interacting drugs and the incidence of myopathy as an adverse drug event. Myopathy comprises a range of musculoskeletal conditions including muscle pain, weakness, and tissue breakdown (rhabdomyolysis). Our statistical analysis identified 5 drug interaction pairs: (loratadine, simvastatin), (loratadine, alprazolam), (loratadine, duloxetine), (loratadine, ropinirole), and (promethazine, tegaserod). When taken together, each drug pair showed a significantly increased risk of myopathy when compared to the expected additive myopathy risk from taking either of the drugs alone. Further investigation suggests that two major drug metabolism proteins, CYP2D6 and CYP3A4, are involved with these five drug pairs' interactions. Overall, our method is robust in that it can incorporate all published literature, all FDA approved drugs, and very large clinical datasets to generate predictions of clinically significant interactions. The interactions can then be further validated in future cell-based experiments and/or clinical studies.
