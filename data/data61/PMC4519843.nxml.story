Coronary artery disease (CAD) and ischemic stroke (IS) are manifestations of atherosclerosis, with a high death rate. miR-146a is a microRNA that participates in the progress of CAD and IS. A single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in the precursor of miR-146a, rs2910164, was found to be associated with the risks of CAD and IS. However, the results were inconsistent and inconclusive. A meta-analysis was performed to assess the relationship of rs2910164 and CAD as well as IS susceptibility. The database Pubmed, Embase, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), Chinese National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), and Chinese Biomedical Literature Database (CBM) were searched for related studies. Crude odds ratios with 95% confidence intervals were used to investigate the strength of the association by random- or fixed-effect model. A total of eight studies, with 3138 cases and 3097 controls were identified for the meta-analysis. The results shows that rs2910164 is associated with the risk of CAD significantly in allelic model (OR = 0.86), homozygous model (OR = 0.70), heterozygous model (OR = 0.80) and dominant model (OR = 0.76). The subjects carrying the GG genotype, GG + GC genotype or G allele are at lower risks of CAD. For the susceptibility of IS, there are no significant associations between rs2910164 and total studies. However, in subgroup analysis by sample size and ethnicity, the GG, GG + GC and G allele of rs2910164 are found to be associated with higher risks of IS in large sample size group and in Koreans, under homozygous and dominant models. In conclusion, the current meta-analysis suggests lower risks of CAD for GG, GG + GC genotype and G allele of rs2910164, while rs2910164 is not associated with the risk of IS. Thus rs2910164 might be recommended as a predictor for susceptibility of CAD, but not IS.
