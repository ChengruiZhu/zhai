The dependence of the Na pump activity of intact renal tubules on the ATP concentration was investigated using a suspension of rabbit cortical tubules. Rotenone (an inhibitor of mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation) was used in graded fashion to alter the cellular ATP, and the Na pump activity was measured when the pump was stimulated by adding KCl to tubules suspended in a K+-free medium. The K+ uptake into the tubule was measured using an extracellular K+ electrode, and the oxygen consumption (QO2) was measured using a Clark-type oxygen electrode. The Na pump activity was found to have a linear, nonsaturating dependence on the ATP concentration. However, the Na,K- ATPase hydrolytic activity (assayed biochemically) of lysed proximal tubule membranes demonstrated saturation and had a K0.5 value of 0.4 mM ATP. Presumably, unknown cytosolic factors present in the intact renal cell but not normally present in the biochemical assay accounted for the differences between the two measurements. The data suggest that an alteration in the intracellular ATP will result in a proportional change in active ion transport activity. Moreover, additional findings also suggest that the basal (non-transport-related) QO2 may be redirected to support the proximal Na pump activity when transport activity is stressed. Thus, basal respiration is not invariant under all conditions, and ion transport activity appears to be maintained foremost among cellular ATP-dependent processes.
