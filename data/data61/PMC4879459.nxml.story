Background: There are no reference guidelines for health care providers regarding appropriate use and interpretation of urine eosinophil protein X (u‐EPX) in clinical practice. Currently, there are no clear‐cut clinical or laboratory parameters to diagnose asthma in young children. Objective: In this study, we (1) systematically reviewed and qualitatively appraised the epidemiological evidence to determine diagnostic u‐EPX cut points for pediatric asthma, and (2) performed a meta‐analysis to provide u‐EPX estimates for diagnosing pediatric asthma. Methods: Research articles in literature were identified from PubMed/Medline and Web of Science databases from 1966 to August 2015. Children <18 years of age were included. Both serum and urine EPX were included. Twenty‐seven studies met the inclusion criteria for the systematic review and nine studies for the meta‐analysis. Details regarding EPX analyses, treatment efficacy, and outcomes were assessed. For meta‐analyses, effect estimates were abstracted using standardized means. Results: Over 70% of studies found a significant relationship between u‐EPX and childhood asthma. There was 1.94 times higher standardized means of u‐EPX among acute asthmatics compared to healthy controls (confidence interval [CI]: 1.67–2.22). Similarly, the difference in standardized means between asymptomatic asthmatics and healthy controls was 1.58 times higher (CI: 1.27–1.88). Conclusions and Clinical Relevance: Despite differences in sample sizes, EPX processing and measurement, and ages of children, a consistent trend of higher EPX levels with childhood asthma was revealed.
