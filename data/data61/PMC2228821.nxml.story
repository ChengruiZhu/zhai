Of the total one-way chloride fluxes (approximately 1.4 meq/liter cell water X min) in steady state human polymorphonuclear leukocytes bathed in 148 mM Cl media, approximately 70% behaves as self-exchange mediated by a nonselective anion carrier that is not inhibited by stilbene disulfonates. Five properties of this carrier-mediated exchange were investigated: substrate saturation is seen with respect to 36Cl influx as a function of the external Cl concentration [for normal-Cl cells, the apparent Km(Cl) is approximately 22 mM when Cl replaces para-amino- hippurate (PAH) and approximately 5 mM when Cl replaces glucuronate], and with respect to 36Cl efflux as a function of the concentration of internal Cl replacing PAH [apparent Km(Cl) congruent to 35 mM for cells bathed in 148 mM Cl]; there is trans stimulation of 36Cl influx by internal Cl (replacing PAH) with an apparent Km(Cl) congruent to 35 mM, and of 36Cl efflux by external Cl with an apparent Km(Cl) congruent to 22 mM (Cl replacing PAH) or approximately 5 mM (Cl replacing glucuronate); there is substrate competition between Cl and PAH, but the carrier appears devoid of affinity for glucuronate; influxes and effluxes mediated by the carrier are subject to competitive inhibition by extracellular alpha-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamate (CHC), with an apparent Ki congruent to 9 mM in Cl medium or approximately 1 mM in PAH medium (transport of the inhibitor itself is very slow); and internal Cl and external Cl or PAH undergo 1:1 countertransport, which is CHC sensitive. A simple equilibrium-competition model is proposed that accounts for all the extracellular ligand interactions presented for normal-Cl cells. Least-squares values of the carrier's true Michaelis constants for extracellular Cl, PAH, and CHC are 5.03 +/- 0.83, 50.3 +/- 14.9, and 0.29 +/- 0.09 mM, respectively.
