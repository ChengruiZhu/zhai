In 2005, a program named “Early Detection and Early Treatment of Esophageal and Cardiac Cancer” (EDETEC) was initiated in China. A total of 8279 residents aged 40–69 years old were recruited into the EDETEC program in Linzhou of Henan Province between 2005 and 2008. Howerer, the cost-benefit of the EDETEC program is not very clear yet. We conducted herein a cost-benefit analysis of screening for esophageal and cardiac cancer. The assessed costs of the EDETEC program included screening costs for each subject, as well as direct and indirect treatment costs for esophageal and cardiac severe dysplasia and cancer detected by screening. The assessed benefits of this program included the saved treatment costs, both direct and indirect, on esophageal and cardiac cancer, as well as the value of prolonged life due to screening, as determined by the human capital approach. The results showed the screening cost of finding esophageal and cardiac severe dysplasia or cancer ranged from ¥2707 to ¥4512, and the total cost on screening and treatment was ¥13 115–¥14 920. The cost benefit was ¥58 944–¥155 110 (the saved treatment cost, ¥17 730, plus the value of prolonged life, ¥41 214–¥137 380). The ratio of benefit-to-cost (BCR) was 3.95–11.83. Our results suggest that EDETEC has a high benefit-to-cost ratio in China and could be instituted into high risk areas of China.
