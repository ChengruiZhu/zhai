Renal cell carcinoma (RCC) is the most common kidney cancer, and accounts for ~3% of all adult malignancies. RCC has proven refractory to conventional treatment modalities but appears to be the only histological form that shows any consistent response to immunotherapeutic approaches. The development of a clinically effective vaccine remains a major strategic target for devising active specific immunotherapy in RCC. We aimed to identify a highly immunogenic antigenic format for immunotherapeutic approaches, so as to boost immune responses in RCC patients. We established and cloned an immunogenic cell line, RCC85#21 named Elthem, which was derived from a non-aggressive and non-metastatic clear cell carcinoma. The cell line characterization was performed by genomics (real-time PCR, genome instability), proteomics (two dimensional electrophoresis, mass spectrometry) and immunological analysis (mixed lymphocytes tumor cell cultures). Real-time PCR confirmed the RCC85#21 cell expression of tumor antigens and cytokine genes. No difference in microsatellite instability (MSI) in RCC85#21 cell line was found as compared to control, loss of heterozygosity was observed in the RCC85#21 clone, but not in the renal cancer cell lines from which it was generated. The image analysis of RCC85#21 by two-dimensional gels showed 700Â±26 spots and 119 spots were identified by mass spectrometry analysis. RCC85#21 promoted a significant RCC-specific T cells activation by exhibiting a cytotoxic phenotype after mixed lymphocyte and tumor cell cultures. CD8
