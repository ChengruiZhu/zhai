Early during embryogenesis, the Slit ligand is present only at the midline of the nerve cord. It binds its receptor Robo on growth cones of axons and guides axons such that they form a series of axon tracts called longitudinal tracts on either side of the midline. It has been proposed that Slit regulates axon guidance through a Slit gradient emanating from the midline. Mid-way through embryogenesis, a distinct set of axons begins to cross the midline, forming commissures. Slit from the midline travels along commissural tracts to the longitudinal connectives. The function of Slit in tracts is not known. The Slit protein is processed into a larger N-terminal peptide and a smaller C-terminal peptide. Here, I show that Slit/Slit-N interact with Robo in tracts to maintain the fasciculation and position of axon tracts following axon guidance. In the absence of Slit in mature tracts after their guidance, the tracts de-fasciculate and merge with one another and shift their position towards the midline. This work also shows that Slit and Slit-N are not freely present in the extracellular milieu but associated with the extracellular matrix and both interact with Robo1. Slit-C is bound tightly in the ECM and does not interact with Robo1. These results define a role for Slit in tracts for axon maintenance and fasciculation, thus the hardwiring of the CNS itself.
