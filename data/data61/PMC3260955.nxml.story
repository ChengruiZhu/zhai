In this work, racemic hybrid polypeptides poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG)-b-poly(racemic-leucine) (PRL) copolymers with different leucine residues have been synthesized and characterized. Using docetaxel as a model molecule, the high drug-loaded spherical micelles based on PEG-PRL were prepared successfully using dialysis, with a tunable particle size from 170 nm to 250 nm obtained by changing the length of the hydrophobic blocks. Facilitated drug-loading behavior (higher drug-loading ability and easier drug-loading process) of PEG-PRL compared with their corresponding levo forms (PEG-b-poly[levo leucine]) was observed and clarified for the first time. With this facilitation, the highest drug-loading content and efficiency of PEG-PRL micelles can achieve 11.2% ± 0.4% and 67.2% ± 2.4%, respectively. All drug-loaded PEG-PRL micelles exhibit a similar release behavior with a sustained release up to 72 hours. The PEG-PRL was shown to be nontoxic against MCF-7 and human umbilical vein endothelial cells up to a concentration of 100 μg/mL, displaying a good biocompatibility. Also, the docetaxel-loaded PEG-PRL micelles were more toxic than the free drug against MCF-7 human breast cancer cells – both dose and time dependent. Therefore, these high docetaxel-loaded micelles based on racemic hybrid polypeptides appear to be a novel promising nanomedicine for anticancer therapy.
