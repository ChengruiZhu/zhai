Oxidative status of albumin was not a useful biomarker for oxidative stress in practical use due to time-consuming measuring method. We evaluated oxidized, human nonmercaptalbumin measured more quickly than ever by a novel method using anion-exchange HPLC. In 60 subjects taking a general health examination, mean serum human nonmercaptalbumin level was 25.1 ± 3.0% with no gender difference but positive correlation with age. There were no links between human nonmercaptalbumin and C-reactive protein, γ-glutamyltransferase or iron, reportedly associated with oxidative stress. Human nonmercaptalbumin correlated with systolic blood pressure, pulse pressure and body mass index among physical findings. Positive correlations were observed between human nonmercaptalbumin and AST, LDH, BUN, or creatinine, suggesting that oxidative stress may link with liver injury and renal function. Human nonmercaptalbumin correlated with uric acid in female but not in male, suggesting that higher uric acid levels may be associated with increased oxidative stress only in female. As another gender difference, white blood cell counts correlated with human nonmercaptalbumin in female, while the parameters for red blood cells correlated with human nonmercaptalbumin in male. In conclusion, serum human nonmercaptalbumin level in healthy subjects was approximately 25% as previously reported. Oxidative stress may be closely associated with hypertension, obesity, liver injury, renal function, and anemia.
