Three different algorithms, as implemented in three different computer programs, were put to the task of extracting direct space lattice parameters from four sets of synthetic images that were per design more or less periodic in two dimensions (2D). One of the test images in each set was per design free of noise and, therefore, genuinely 2D periodic so that it adhered perfectly to the constraints of a Bravais lattice type, Laue class, and plane symmetry group. Gaussian noise with a mean of zero and standard deviations of 10 and 50% of the maximal pixel intensity was added to the individual pixels of the noise-free images individually to create two more images and thereby complete the sets. The added noise broke the strict translation and site/point symmetries of the noise-free images of the four test sets so that all symmetries that existed per design turned into pseudo-symmetries of the second kind. Moreover, motif and translation-based pseudo-symmetries of the first kind, a.k.a. genuine pseudo-symmetries, and a metric specialization were present per design in the majority of the noise-free test images already. With the extraction of the lattice parameters from the images of the synthetic test sets, we assessed the robustness of the algorithms’ performances in the presence of both Gaussian noise and pre-designed pseudo-symmetries. By applying three different computer programs to the same image sets, we also tested the reliability of the programs with respect to subsequent geometric inferences such as Bravais lattice type assignments. Partly due to per design existing pseudo-symmetries of the first kind, the lattice parameters that the utilized computer programs extracted in their default settings disagreed for some of the test images even in the absence of noise, i.e., in the absence of pseudo-symmetries of the second kind, for any reasonable error estimates. For the noisy images, the disagreement of the lattice parameter extraction results from the algorithms was typically more pronounced. Non-default settings and re-interpretations/re-calculations on the basis of program outputs allowed for a reduction (but not a complete elimination) of the differences in the geometric feature extraction results of the three tested algorithms. Our lattice parameter extraction results are, thus, an illustration of Kenichi Kanatani’s dictum that no extraction algorithm for geometric features from images leads to
