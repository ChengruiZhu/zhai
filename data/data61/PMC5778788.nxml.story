This study aims to comparatively analyze the impact of laparoscopic myomectomy (LM) and transcervical resection of myoma (TCRM) on ovarian function, immune function and quality of sexual life of patients with hysteromyoma. Two hundred and forty patients with hysteromyoma admitted into the Second Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University from June 2014 to June 2016 were divided into laparoscopic myomectomy group (LM group, n=120) and transcervical resection of myoma group (TCRM group, n=120) according to random figure table. The difference between the two surgical methods were compared among hysteromyoma patients of different age in the following aspects: perioperative indicators, ovarian function, immune function and quality of sexual life before treatment and after operation. 1) there was no significant difference in age structure between LM and TCRM group (P>0.05). 2) There were no significant differences in the amount of bleeding, operative time, analgesics usage rate between the groups (P>0.05), but the anal exhaust time, postoperative ambulation time, hospitalization time and hospitalization costs in TCRM group were significantly less than that in LM group, the difference was statistically significant (P<0.01). 3) Before treatment and in the 3rd, and 6th month after operation, there was no significant difference on follicle stimulating hormone (FSH), luteinizing hormone (LH) or estradiol (E2) level between the two groups (P>0.05); but in the 3rd month after operation, the level of E2 decreased remarkably, with FSH and LH level increased significantly compared with the 6th month after operation and before treatment (P<0.05). 4) Compared with the preoperative status, there was no significant decrease in humoral immunity (IgG, IgA, IgM) and cellular immune function (CD4
