We studied 2405 (1375 male and 1030 female) cases of AKI in the age range 1–95 (mean: 40.32) years. The incidence of CAAKI in 1983–95 and 1996–2008 was 1.95 and 4.14 per 1000 admission, respectively (P < 0.01). Obstetrical AKI has decreased because of the declining number of post-abortal AKI. Surgical AKI decreased from 13.8% in 1983–95 to 9.17% in 1996–2008(P < 0.01). Malarial AKI increased significantly from 4.7% in the first half of the study to 17% in the later period (P < 0.01). Diarrhea-associated AKI had significantly decreased from 36.83% in 1983–95 to 19% in 1996–2008 (P < 0.01). Sepsis-related AKI had increased from 1.57% in 1983–95 to 11.43% in 1996–2008 (P < 0.01). Nephrotoxic AKI showed an increasing trend in recent years (P < 0.01) and mainly caused by rifampicin and NSAIDs. Liver disease-related AKI increased from 1.73% in 1983–95 to 3.17% in 1996–2008 (P < 0.01). Myeloma-associated acute renal failure (ARF) accounted for 1.25% of the total number of ARF cases in the period 1996–2008. HIV infection contributed to 1.65% of ARF of the total number of AKI cases in the second period (1996–2008). Incidence of renal cortical necrosis (RCN) decreased significantly from 5.8% in 1983–95 to 1.3% in 1996–2008 of the total number of ARF cases (P < 0.01). However, during the same period ARF due to acute tubular necrosis, acute glomerulonephritis and acute interstitial nephritis remained unchanged. The mortality rate from AKI decreased significantly from 20% in 1983–95 to 10.98% in 1996–2008 (P < 0.01).
