Nanomedicine era is not far from its realization, but a major concern of targeted delivery still stands tall in its way. Herein we demonstrate the mechanism underlying the anticancer activity of an RNA aptamer (Apt) conjugated to gefitinib-loaded poly (lactic co-glycolic acid) nanoparticles (GNPs). Apt was selected through Cell-SELEX (systemic evolution of ligands by exponential enrichment) process against gefitinib-resistant H1975 lung cancer cells. The selected aptamer exhibited high specificity toward H1975 cells, both qualitatively as well as quantitatively. Software analysis using the MATCH tool predicted Ets1, a proto-oncoprotein, to be the target of the selected aptamer. Interestingly, the localization of identified aptamer varied in descending order of Ets1 expression, wherein maximum localization was observed in H1975 cells than in MDA-MB231, DU-145, H23, H460, A431, A549 and MCF-7 cells, and minimum in L132 cells. Furthermore, Apt-GNP bio-conjugate showed augmented anticancer activity specifically in Ets1-overexpressing cells. In addition, partial depletion of Ets1 in H1975 cells and overexpression of Ets1 in L132 cells reversed the targeting efficacy of the aptamer. Notably, a single intratumoral injection of the Apt-GNP bio-conjugate abrogated the growth of tumor in H1975 xenograft nude mice. Altogether, we present a pioneering platform, involving aptamers, which can be clinically used as a diagnostic marker for metastasis as well as an effective delivery system to escort the pharmaceutical cargo specifically to Ets1-overexpressing highly progressive tumors.
