Osteosarcoma, one of the most common primary bone malignances, is a leading cause of cancer death among children and adolescents. Recently, growing studies have found that long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) can interfere with the expression of various genes, and participate in the occurrence and development of malignancies. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the potential functions of lncRNAs as diagnostic biomarkers and therapeutic targets for osteosarcoma in mice, thus to direct the strict design for the future preclinical experiments and clinical trials. We systematically searched PubMed, Web of Science, Embase, China Knowledge Resource Integrated Database, VIP, Chinese BioMedical and Wan Fang Database from their initiation date to June 20, 2017. Two researchers independently screened the literatures and withdrew the data, which used the tumor volume and tumor weight as the outcome measures. A total of 10 studies were included, and the results of this meta-analysis revealed that lncRNAs could serve as the diagnostic biomarkers and therapeutic targets for osteosarcoma; and progression of osteosarcoma in mice could be inhibited via rescuing the abnormally expressed lncRNAs. It is necessary to carry out more rigorous basic experiments before lncRNAs can be further investigated in the clinical trials and used in future clinical practices.
