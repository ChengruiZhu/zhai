Intensity fluctuation autocorrelation functions of laser light scattered by actively contracting muscle were measured at points in the scattered field. They were reproducible and showed characteristics which depended on the physiological state of the muscle and the parameters of the scattering geometry. The autocorrelation functions had large amplitudes and decay rates that varied significantly with the phase of the contraction-relaxation cycle. The dependence of the autocorrelation function on scattering geometry indicated many elements with diameters on the order of 0.5 mum (presumed to be myofibrillar sarcomeres or their A bands or I bands) undergo independent random changes in their axial positions and their internal distribution of optical polarizability during the plateau of an isometric tetanus. The experimental results are interpreted in terms of a model in which most of the scattering elements in isometrically contracting muscle have random fluctuating axial velocities of average magnitude 20 nm/ms that persist for a few milliseconds at least. In addition to these axial motions there are local fluctuations in polarizability. Similar intensity fluctuation autocorrelation functions were observed throughout the active state on two muscle preparations, whole sartorius muscle and small bundles of single fibers (three to eight) of semitendinosus muscle. These results imply that the tension developed during an isometric tetanus contains a fluctuating component as well as a constant component.
