The coexistence within the same tumor of a variety of subpopulations, featuring different phenotypes (intra-tumoral heterogeneity) represents a challenge for diagnosis, prognosis and targeted therapies. In this work, we have explored the metabolic differences underlying tumor heterogeneity by building cell-type-specific genome-scale metabolic models that integrate transcriptome and metabolome data of two clonal subpopulations derived from the same prostate cancer cell line (PC-3). These subpopulations display either highly proliferative, cancer stem cell (PC-3/M) or highly invasive, epithelial-mesenchymal-transition-like phenotypes (PC-3/S). Our model-driven analysis and experimental validations have unveiled a differential utilization of the long-chain fatty acids pool in both subpopulations. More specifically, our findings show an enhanced entry of long-chain fatty acids into the mitochondria in PC-3/M cells, while in PC-3/S cells, long-chain fatty acids are used as precursors of eicosanoid metabolism. The different utilization of long-chain fatty acids between subpopulations endows PC-3/M cells with a highly proliferative phenotype while enhances PC-3/S invasive phenotype. The present work provides a tool to unveil key metabolic nodes associated with tumor heterogeneity and highlights potential subpopulation-specific targets with important therapeutic implications.
