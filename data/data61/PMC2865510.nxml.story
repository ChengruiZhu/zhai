Hematopoiesis—blood cell development—has long served as a model for study of cellular differentiation and its control by underlying gene regulatory networks. The Scl-Gata2-Fli1 triad is a network module essential for the development of hematopoietic stem cells but its mechanistic role is not well understood. The transcription factors Scl, Gata2 and Fli1 act in combination to upregulate transcription of each other via distal enhancer site binding. Similar network architectures are essential in other multipotent cell lines. We propose a method that uses experimental results to circumvent the difficulties of mathematically modeling the combinatorial regulation of this triad module. Using this dynamical model we show that the triad exhibits robust bistable behavior. Environmental signals can irreversibly switch the triad between stable states in a manner that reflects the unidirectional switching in the formation and subsequent differentiation of hematopoietic stem cells. We also show that the triad makes reliable decisions in noisy environments by only switching in response to transient signals that persist longer than the threshold duration. These results suggest that the Scl-Gata2-Fli1 module possibly functions as a control switch for hematopoietic stem cell development. The proposed method can be extended for quantitative characterization of other combinatorial gene regulatory modules.
