Olfactory receptor neurons respond to odors in the olfactory epithelium located in the nasal cavity in mammals. Each olfactory receptor neuron expresses only one olfactory receptor, out of several hundred encoded in the mammalian genome. Olfactory receptor neurons expressing the same olfactory receptor are scattered throughout the olfactory epithelium; however, their axons converge in one of thousands of glomeruli in the olfactory bulb. The glomeruli are the first neural relay station in the olfactory system, where olfactory receptor neurons transmit olfactory information to mitral cells. It is well established that different odors evoke different spatial patterns across the glomeruli. It is believed that the more similar the patterns, the more similar the evoked odor perceptions. Glomeruli also are activated in odor-specific sequences in time. These dynamics could increase the amount of information about odors by immense amounts. We used transgenic mice, whose mitral cells were made responsive to light, and asked how well they could discriminate the temporal dynamics of simple spatial patterns of light presented to the olfactory bulb after each sniff. Mice could detect the presence of temporal dynamics down to 13 ms, which provides ample resolution for them to be able to detect the dynamics in response to actual odors. Mice could also discern whether virtual odors, based on actual olfactory bulb activity, were dynamic or static and did so without reference to exact sniff-time. We conclude that both the spatial glomerular activity patterns and the temporal dynamics thereof are used in the mammalian olfactory system to encode odors.
