Serological analysis of recombinant tumor cDNA expression library (SEREX) is a powerful and widely used method to explore the cancer immune environment. In the present study, immunoscreening of normal testicular tissues and malignant mesothelioma (MM) cancer MSTO-211H cell line cDNA libraries with sera from 5 MM patients led to the isolation of 16 independent antigens, which were designated ‘Korea Pusan-Malignant Mesothelioma’ (KP-MM)-1 to −16. In total, 3/16 antigens were identified using the results of previous SEREX analyses, and 13 were newly identified. Of these, KP-MM-8, which was subsequently identified as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis 2 chromosome region candidate 11, was shown to be tissue-restricted. Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction demonstrated KP-MM-8 to be expressed strongly only in the normal testis, and weakly in the spleen, prostate, ovary, heart and skeletal muscle. In addition, KP-MM-8 mRNA was identified in MM cell lines, and in various other cancer cell lines, including MM (3/4), lung cancer (5/7), melanoma (5/7) and liver cancer (5/5) cell lines. Additionally, 2/16 antigens (KP-MM-2 and KP-MM-6) exclusively reacted with sera from cancer patients. However, KP-MM-8 reacted with 1 of 8 MM sera. Notably, 8/8 patients with MM and 8/8 normal individuals exhibited antibodies reactive to KP-MM-5, which was identified as cell division cycle 25B, a known oncogene. Overall, this data suggests that KP-MM-8 may be considered as a cancer/testis-like antigen and KP-MM-5 as an immunogenic tumor antigen in MM patients.
