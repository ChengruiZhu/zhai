The modification of target proteins by conjugation to SUMO—a small protein that acts as a regulatory tag—is essential for maintaining the integrity of genomes in most eukaryotic organisms. One critical step during the attachment of SUMO is the activation of the enzymes that catalyze this reaction—E1, E2, and the SUMO ligases. However, we currently do not fully understand how the different enzymes in the SUMO pathway are regulated. The SUMO ligase Mms21 is known to bind to Smc5/6, a large protein complex involved in the structural maintenance of chromosomes. Both Mms21 and Smc5/6 counteract the accumulation of recombination intermediates, which otherwise join replicated chromosomes, preventing their separation. Not surprisingly, the few known targets of the Mms21 ligase are mostly related to the repair of sister chromatids by recombination. Here, we show that the Mms21 SUMO ligase needs to bind to the Smc5/6 complex to promote chromosome separation. We used two Mms21-dependent SUMO conjugation targets—Smc5 and cohesin—to study the connection between the Mms21’s SUMO ligase activity and its binding partner, Smc5/6. Our results indicated that Mms21 activation is tightly coordinated with the intrinsic ATPase function of the Smc5/6 complex. However, the SUMO ligase and the ATPase lie in different domains of the Smc5/6-Mms21 complex that are normally distant from each other; we show that communication between these enzyme sites is enabled by the presence of conserved joints, which we suggest allow the necessary conformational changes required for SUMO ligase activation. This coordination of activities is extremely helpful for the cell, enabling it to integrate a structural role on chromatin during DNA repair with a signaling function, thereby promoting correct separation of the chromosomes.
