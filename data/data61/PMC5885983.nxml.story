We searched PubMed with terms “(cystic fibrosis survival) and (projection OR model OR registry OR United Kingdom OR UK)” to identify relevant studies on survival estimates for individuals with cystic fibrosis (CF). We also considered the most recent annual report from the UK Cystic Fibrosis Registry (Cystic Fibrosis Trust, 2016), a review by Buzzetti and colleagues (2009), the chapter on Epidemiology of Cystic Fibrosis by MacNeill (2016), the study of MacKenzie and colleagues (2014), and references therein. There have been many studies of factors associated with survival in CF; most have focused on identifying risk factors, and only a few have presented estimated survival curves, which are the focus of this work. The most recent study of survival in the UK is by Dodge and colleagues (2007), who used data obtained from CF clinics and the national death register, and gave an estimate of survival for babies born in 2003. We found no previous studies that have obtained detailed information on survival using UK Cystic Fibrosis Registry data. Jackson and colleagues obtained survival estimates for the US and Ireland using registry data (Jackson et al., 2011). MacKenzie and colleagues used US Cystic Fibrosis Foundation Patient Registry data from 2000 to 2010 to project survival for children born and diagnosed with CF in 2010, accounting for sex, genotype and age at diagnosis (MacKenzie et al., 2014). Previous studies on estimated survival in CF have become out of date or have not accounted for the full range of patient characteristics available at birth. Few have presented conditional survival estimates (Dodge et al., 2007).
