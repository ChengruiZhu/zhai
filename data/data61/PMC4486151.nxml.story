The sinoatrial node (SAN) and the atrioventricular node (AVN) are the anatomical and functional regions of the heart which play critical roles in the generation and conduction of the electrical impulse. Their functions are ensured by peculiar structural cytological properties and specific collections of ion channels. Impairment of SAN and AVN activity is generally acquired,but in some cases familial inheritance has been established and therefore a genetic cause is involved. In recent years, combined efforts of clinical practice and experimental basic science studies have identified and characterized several causative gene mutations associated with the nodal syndromes. Channelopathies, i.e., diseases associated with defective ion channels, remain the major cause of genetically determined nodal arrhythmias; however, it is becoming increasingly evident that mutations in other classes of regulatory and structural proteins also have profound pathophysiological roles. In this review, we will present some aspects of the genetic identification of the molecular mechanism underlying both SAN and AVN dysfunctions with a particular focus on mutations of the Na, pacemaker (HCN), and Ca channels. Genetic defects in regulatory proteins and calcium-handling proteins will be also considered. In conclusion, the identification of the genetic defects associated with familial nodal dysfunction is an essential step for implementing an appropriate therapeutic treatment.
