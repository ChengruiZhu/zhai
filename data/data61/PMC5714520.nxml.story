Recently a new iterative reconstruction algorithm named Sinogram Affirmed Iterative Reconstruction (SAFIRE) has been released by Siemens. This algorithm works in the raw data domain with noise reduction as main purpose, providing five different strengths. In this study, the effect of SAFIRE on image quality has been investigated using selected phantoms and a comparison with standard filtered back projection (FBP) has been carried out. The following quantitative parameters have been evaluated: image noise, impact of different reconstruction kernels on noise reduction, noise power spectrum (NPS), contrast‐to‐noise ratio (CNR), spatial resolution, and linearity and accuracy of CT numbers. The influence of strengths on image quality parameters has also been examined. Results show that image noise reduction is independent of reconstruction kernel and strongly related to the strength of SAFIRE applied. The peak of NPS curve for SAFIRE reconstructions is shifted towards low frequencies; this effect is more marked at higher levels of strength. Contrast‐to‐noise ratio is always improved in SAFIRE reconstruction and increases with higher strength. At different dose levels SAFIRE preserves CT number accuracy, linearity, and spatial resolution, both in transversal and coronal planes. These results confirm that SAFIRE allows for image noise reduction with preserved image quality. First clinical data to validate this phantom analysis and confirm that commercially available iterative algorithms can play an effective role in dose containment.
