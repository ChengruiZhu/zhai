Septins are a novel class of GTP-binding cytoskeletal proteins evolutionarily conserved from yeast to mammals and have now been found to play a contributing role in a broad range of tumor types. However, their functional importance in breast cancer remains largely unclear. Here, we demonstrated that pharmaceutical inhibition of global septin dynamics would greatly suppress proliferation, migration and invasiveness in breast cancer cell lines. We then examined the expression and subcellular distribution of the selected septins SEPT2 and SEPT7 in breast cancer cells, revealing a rather variable localization of the two proteins with cell cycle progression. To determine the role of both septins in mediating malignant behavior of cancer cells, we used RNA silencing to specifically deplete endogenous SEPT2 or SEPT7 in highly invasive breast cancer cell line MDA-MB-231. Our findings showed that SEPT2/7 depletion had virtually identical inhibitory effects on cellular proliferation, apoptosis, migration and invasion. Moreover, the opposite performance in migration and invasion was observed after enforced expression of SEPT2/7 in the same cell line. We further demonstrated MEK/ERK activation, but not other MAPKs and AKT, was positively correlated with the protein levels of SEPT2 and SEPT7. Additionally, in SEPT2/7-overexpressing cells, the MEK specific inhibitor U0126 was able to correct the high active status of MEK/ERK while normalizing the increased invasive behaviors of these cells. Taken together, these results strongly suggest that SEPT2 and SEPT7 are involved in breast carcinogenesis and may serve as valuable therapeutic targets for breast cancer.
