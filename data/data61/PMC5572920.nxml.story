Retrovirus integration into the host genome relies on several host enzymes, potentially including DNA polymerase β (Pol β). However, whether human Pol β is essential for lentivirus replication in human cells is unclear. Here, we abolished DNA polymerase β (Pol β) expression by targeting its DNA polymerase domain with CRISPR/Cas9 in human monocytic THP-1 cells to investigate the role of Pol β in HIV-1 transduction in both dividing and nondividing macrophage stages of THP-1 cells. Pol β–knock-out was confirmed by enhanced sensitivity to methyl methanesulfonate-induced DNA damage. Of note, nuclear extracts from Pol β–knock-out THP-1 cells prepared from both dividing and nondividing stages displayed significantly reduced capability to repair the gapped HIV-1 integration intermediate DNA substrate in a biochemical simulation. However, nuclear extract from both dividing and nondividing stages of the Pol β–KO cells had detectable gap repair activity, suggesting that other host DNA polymerases also repair gapped HIV-1 DNA, particularly in dividing cells. Next, when we compared transduction using HIV-1 and simian immunodeficiency virus in control and Pol β–KO cells, the loss of the Pol β expression did not affect transduction efficiency of these lentiviruses in both dividing and nondividing stages. Finally, the gap repair assay indicated that limited cellular dNTP pools, but not Pol β expression, are a primary factor for HIV-1 DNA gap repair, particularly in nondividing cells. These data support the idea that Pol β polymerase activity is dispensable for HIV-1 infection in both dividing and nondividing stages of human cells targeted by the virus.
