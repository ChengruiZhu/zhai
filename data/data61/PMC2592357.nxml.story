In higher eukaryotes, tissue development and homeostasis involves a subtle balance between rates of cell birth and death. Cell death (apoptosis) is triggered by activation of caspases, specialized enzymes that digest essential cellular constituents and trigger degradation of genomic DNA. Under normal circumstances receptor-dependent cell death is very tightly repressed, but it is irreversibly induced upon receipt of an appropriate signal. Mutations that interfere with this all-or-none control contribute to developmental abnormalities, autoimmune disease, and cancer. The biochemical properties of most apoptotic proteins are quite well understood, but it is unclear how these proteins work together. By combining live-cell microscopy, genetic perturbation, and mathematical modeling, we seek quantitative insight into cell death with a focus on network dynamics and control. We find that cells vary dramatically in the time between receipt of an apoptotic signal and the commitment to death. This variability arises from cell-to-cell differences in the activities of receptor-proximal biochemical reactions. Rapid all-or-none progress from commitment to actual death is achieved downstream by pro-apoptotic proteins found in the mitochondrial membrane. Our work provides a quantitative picture of apoptosis that advances understanding of oncogenic mechanisms and should eventually assist in the development of pro-apoptotic cancer therapies.
