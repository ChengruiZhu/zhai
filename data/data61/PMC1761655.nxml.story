Protein folding is one of the most challenging issues in biophysical science. During the past few years it has been shown that some diseases are connected with protein misfolding and the formation of insoluble aggregates called amyloid plaques. These processes may be associated with several diseases such as Alzheimer disease, Parkinson disease, Creutzfeldt-Jacob disease, and even certain forms of cancer. It has been shown that proteins with intrinsically disordered regions are involved in protein–protein or protein–nucleic acid interactions. The main objective of this paper is to report insights into the molecular mechanisms of amyloid aggregation. This has been done using the parameter of the observed number of contacts for each amino acid residue in globular state, further called expected packing density. By analysis of sequences alone, the authors have demonstrated that regions that possess strong expected packing density can be responsible for amyloidogenic properties of a protein, while regions with weak expected packing density correspond to disordered regions. A new concept is proposed that could aid in understanding protein folding, misfolding, and amyloidosis. The results help to explain that the nature of the amyloidogenic propensity of proteins is connected to their amino acid sequences that are able to form a large number of contacts.
