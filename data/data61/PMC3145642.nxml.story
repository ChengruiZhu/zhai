Current theory of the spatial spread of pathogens predicts travelling waves at constant or increasing speed in homogeneous environments. However, in urban environments, increasing and often unregulated development produces a highly heterogeneous landscape. Such heterogeneity affects pathogens spread by insect vectors particularly, which typically have short dispersal distances. We hypothesized that high levels of heterogeneity can slow the spread of such pathogens, resulting in decelerating epidemic waves. We analysed the annual spread of West Nile virus (WNV) in New York City (NYC), using a dataset containing >1,000,000 records since the origin of the North American pandemic in 1999. Our analysis provides the first evidence of endogenous decelerating travelling waves in an emerging infectious disease. We found that WNV spread with decreasing speed in each season and rejected four alternative hypotheses to explain this deceleration. A mathematical model shows that high levels of heterogeneity can lead to such decelerating travelling waves. Interestingly, the level of heterogeneity in land-cover types associated with WNV-positive dead birds in NYC is of the order of magnitude required to produce decelerating travelling waves in the model. Consequently, we propose that control strategies targeting key sites may be effective at slowing WNV spread in NYC.
