Lymphocytes become adherent and aggregate after stimulation with phorbol esters such as PMA. Time-lapse video showed that aggregating cells were motile and exhibited vigorous pseudopodial movements. Adhesion sites were initiated between pseudopodia of neighboring cells, and then moved to the uropod. PMA-stimulated aggregation by EBV- transformed B cell lines, SKW-3 (a T cell line), differentiated U937 (a monocytic line), and blood lymphocytes was inhibited by mAbs to LFA-1. A number of different mAb to the LFA-1 alpha and beta subunits and F(ab')2 and Fab' fragments inhibited aggregation. Furthermore, lymphoblasts from normal individuals, but not from LFA-1-deficient patients, aggregated in response to PMA. These findings suggest LFA-1 is critically involved in stimulated lymphocyte adhesion. LFA-1 expression was not increased by PMA stimulation, showing that other mechanisms regulate LFA-1-dependent adherence. LFA-1-deficient patient cells were able to coaggregate with LFA-1+ cells, showing that aggregation is not mediated by like-like interactions between LFA-1 molecules on opposite cells. Aggregation was Mg+2-dependent, inhibited by cytochalasin B, and was reversed when LFA-1 mAb was added to preformed aggregates. Previous findings suggesting that LFA-1 is important in a wide variety of leukocyte functions are elucidated by this work, which shows that LFA-1 is a general leukocyte cell adhesion molecule, the activity of which is regulated by cell activation.
