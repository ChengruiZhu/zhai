Earlier we had shown that the MDM2 inhibitor (MI-219) belonging to the spiro-oxindole family can synergistically enhance the efficacy of platinum chemotherapeutics leading to 50% tumor free survival in a genetically complex pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) xenograft model. In this report, we have taken a systems and network modeling approach in order to understand central mechanisms behind MI219-oxaliplatin synergy with validation in PDAC, colon and breast cancer cell lines. Microarray profiling of drug treatments (MI-219, oxaliplatin or their combination) in capan-2 cells reveal a similar unique set of gene alterations that is duplicated in other solid tumor cells. As single agent, MI-219 or oxaliplatin induced alterations in 48 and 761 genes respectively. The combination treatment resulted in 767 gene alterations with emergence of 286 synergy unique genes. Ingenuity network modeling of combination and synergy unique genes showed the crucial role of five key local networks CREB, CARF, EGR1, NF-kB and E Cadherin. The network signatures were validated at the protein level in all three cell lines. Individually silencing central nodes in these five hubs resulted in abrogation of MI-219-oxaliplatin activity confirming their critical role in aiding p53 mediated apoptotic response. We anticipate that our MI219-oxaliplatin network blueprints can be clinically translated in the rationale design and application of this unique therapeutic combination in a genetically pre-defined subset of patients.
