To gain access to sites of inflammation, leukocytes must first adhere to the blood vessel wall using integrin molecules. It has been hypothesized that integrin clustering is essential for sustaining adhesion prior to transmigration into the inflamed tissue. We cannot challenge such hypotheses directly because it is infeasible to measure molecular level events during the leukocyte adhesion process. At best correlative relationships have been made. The alternative approach undertaken was to experimentally challenge the hypothesized mechanisms in silico. We used object-oriented, software engineering methods to build and execute multi-level, multi-attribute analogues of leukocytes and binding surfaces. The simulated leukocytes contained diffusible objects (representing integrins) on their surface that were allowed to interact with binding partners on simulated endothelial surfaces. Validation was achieved across different experimental conditions, in vitro, ex vivo, and in vivo, at both the individual cell and population levels. Consequently, the finalized virtual mechanisms stand as a concrete, working theory about detailed events occurring at the leukocyte-surface interface during adhesion. We challenged mechanistic hypotheses by conducting experiments in which the consequences of multiple mechanistic events were tracked. We discovered that integrin clustering was not necessary to achieve adhesion as long as integrin and binding partner object densities were above a critical level. Importantly, at low densities integrin clustering enabled adhesion that exhibited measurable, cell level positive cooperativity.
