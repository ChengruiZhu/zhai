Loss of p53 function due to human papillomavirus (HPV) infection induces resistance to apoptosis in cervical cancer cells. Tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL), which induces apoptosis in a p53-independent manner, may provide an alternative strategy for treating cervical cancer. Survivin, an antiapoptotic protein that is highly expressed in cancer cells, regulates apoptosis and the cell cycle. Here, we investigated the therapeutic potential of targeting survivin, while focusing on the TRAIL-induced apoptosis pathway. The viability and cell cycle of HPV16-positive CaSki and SiHa cells were assessed after survivin knockdown by small interfering RNA (si-survivin). E-cadherin expression was also assessed after si-survivin treatment, using western blotting. SiHa (a TRAIL-resistant cell line) was used for further studies. The small molecule YM155 and resveratrol (RVT; a polyphenol with the potential to suppress survivin expression) were used as survivin inhibitors. The effects of si-survivin and survivin inhibitors on TRAIL- or cisplatin (CDDP)-induced apoptosis were analyzed by annexin-V staining. si-survivin treatment decreased cell viability and led to G2/M arrest, accompanied by morphological changes and E-cadherin upregulation in both CaSki and SiHa cells. si-survivin and YM155 synergistically sensitized TRAIL-resistant SiHa cells to TRAIL-induced apoptosis (
