Meiosis is a specialized cell division to generate haploid sperm and eggs. For accurate segregation of homologous chromosomes during the first meiotic division, chromosome synapsis and recombination should be properly established between them during the prophase I stage. Chromosome synapsis and recombination proceed in the context of the meiotic chromosome axis. While studies using knockout mouse models have revealed that chromosome axis components play roles in multiple chromosomal events during mammalian meiosis, it remains to be elucidated how they contribute to the processes. Here, we show that many mammalian meiotic chromosome axis proteins are phosphorylated in a spatially and temporally distinct manner during the prophase I stage. Especially, phosphorylation of HORMAD1 and SMC3 was observed preferentially in chromosomal regions where synapsis has not occurred. Moreover, phosphorylation of HORMAD1 and HORMAD2 was reduced in mutant testicular cells that were defective in recombination initiation or chromosome axis organization. Additionally, the mutant spermatocytes failed to correctly distribute checkpoint proteins that coordinate chromosome synapsis with gene expression and meiotic progression. Thus, it is suggested that phosphorylation of chromosome axis proteins serves as integrative axis marks for the status of events that take place on meiotic chromosomes.
