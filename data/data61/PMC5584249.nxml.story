This study aims to explore the correlation between microRNA-143 (miR-143) expression in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and disease severity in patients with psoriasis vulgaris. From March 2014 to November 2015, 194 patients with psoriasis vulgaris (102 patients in progressive stage and 92 patients in stable stage) were selected as the case group and 175 healthy people as a control group were enrolled in this study. ELISA was used to detect the levels of IL-17 and VEGF in serum. The qRT-PCR assay was performed to detect the relative expression of miR-143 in PBMCs. Disease severity in psoriasis vulgaris patients was graded with Psoriasis Lesions Area and Severity Index (PASI). The value of miR-143 expression in PBMCs for the diagnosis of psoriasis vulgaris was evaluated using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve. The correlation between miR-143 expression in PBMCs and PASI scores was measured using Spearman rank correlation analysis. Compared with the control group, serum levels of IL-17 and VEGF were higher and miR-143 expression in PBMCs was lower in the case group. Furthermore, miR-143 expression in PBMCs was lower in patients in progressive stage than that in patients with stable stage. The relative expression of miR-143 in PBMCs was negatively correlated with PASI scores of patients with psoriasis vulgaris. ROC curve showed that miR-143 was a reliable and accurate biomarker of psoriasis vulgaris. Our findings suggest that miR-143 expression in PBMCs is negatively correlated the disease severity in psoriasis vulgaris.
