Seventy-three unilateral ACL injured patients at four different sites were included in this study. While performing the standardized pivot shift test under anesthesia, two quantitative technologies were utilized; an accelerometer and image analysis system using iPad. Accelerometer wireless sensor (KiRA, Orthokey, Italy) was attached on the lateral side of the tibial tubercle using a strap (Figure1A). The tibial acceleration was recorded through a Bluetooth connection to the tablet PC. Image analysis of lateral compartment translation was simultaneously performed using software implemented on iPad (Apple Inc, USA) which tracked the movement of three markers on the lateral side of the knee joint (two on the lateral tibial plateau and one on the lateral femoral epicondyle) to measure the anterior-posterior shift between the lateral tibia and femur (Figure 1B). Tibial acceleration and the lateral compartment translation were compared to the clinical pivot shift grade (grade 0, 1, 2 and 3). Spearman correlations were use to determine the relationship between the quantitative measurements and clinical pivot shift grade. Considering limited number of individuals with a grade 0 and 3 pivot shift test, we used independent t-tests to compare the quantitative measurements between those with a grade 0 or 1 (low grade) pivot shift versus grade 2 or 3 (high grade) pivot shift. The alpha level was set at p<0.05.
