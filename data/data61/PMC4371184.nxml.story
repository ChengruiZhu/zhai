The mandibular canal divides into the mental and incisive canals at the premolar region, forms the anterior loop which crosses anterior to the mental foramen, and turns back to reach the mental foramen. The aim of this study was to elucidate the general anatomical structure of the anterior loop of the mandibular canal using morphometry. Twenty-six hemimandibles from 19 cadavers (16 males, 3 females; mean age at death, 54.4 years) were studied by meticulous dissection with the aid of a surgical microscope. The location of the anterior loop, the diameters of the mandibular, mental, and incisive canals, and their distances from bony landmarks were measured using digital calipers. The anterior loop of the mandibular canal was located 3.05±1.15 mm (mean±SD) anterior to the anterior margin of the mental foramen and 2.72±1.41 mm inferior to the superior margin of the mental foramen, and was 4.34±1.46 mm long. The diameters of the mandibular, mental, and incisive canals were 2.8±0.49, 2.63±0.64, and 2.22±0.59 mm, respectively. The distances between the inferior border of the mandible and each of these canals were 7.82±1.52, 10.11±1.27, and 9.08±1.66 mm, respectively. The anterior loop of the mandibular canal was located a mean of 3.1 mm anterior and 2.7 mm inferior to the mental foramen, and continued upward and backward into the mental canal, and forward into the incisive canal. These detailed morphological features of the anterior loop of the mandibular canal represent useful practical anatomical knowledge regarding the interforaminal region.
