Priapism is a debilitating disease for which there is at present no clinically accepted pharmacologic intervention. It has been estimated that priapism lasting more than 24 hours in patients is associated with a 44â€“90% rate of erectile dysfunction (ED). In this investigation we determined in two animal models of priapism (opiorpin-induced priapism in the rat and priapism in a mouse model of sickle cell disease) if there is evidence for an increase in markers of oxidative stress in corporal tissue. In both animal models we demonstrate that priapism results in increased levels of lipid peroxidation, glutathione S-transferase activity, and oxidatively damaged proteins in corporal tissue. Using Western blot analysis we demonstrated there is up regulation of the ubiquitination ligase proteins, Nedd-4 and Mdm-2, and the lysososomal autophage protein, LC3. The anti-apoptotic protein, Bcl-2, was also up regulated. Overall, we demonstrate that priapism is associated with increased oxidative stress in corporal tissue and the activation of protein degradation pathways. Since oxidative stress is known to mediate the development of ED resulting from several etiologies (for example ED resulting from diabetes and aging) we suggest that damage to erectile tissue resulting from priapism might be prevented by treatments targeting oxidative stress.
