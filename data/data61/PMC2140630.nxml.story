 is reached, all three kinds of electrolytes, acids, alkalies, and neutral salts, have a depressing effect on both types of potentials (taking into due consideration the effect of changes in the hydrogen ion concentration). 3. This depressing effect is adequately explained for the membrane potentials of protein solutions and protein gels on the basis of the Donnan equilibrium, and the question arises whether the same explanation may also hold for the cataphoretic potentials. 4. The active ion in the depressing action of electrolytes on membrane potentials as well as on cataphoretic potentials has the opposite sign of charge from that of the colloidal particle. It had been shown before that only the valency but not the chemical nature of the active ion determines the depressing effect in the case of membrane potentials and it is shown in this paper that the same is true for the cataphoretic potentials of particles of collodion, mastic, Acheson's graphite, and denatured egg albumin. 5. It is shown that the same valency rule holds also for the effect of acids on the cataphoretic potentials of collodion particles coated with gelatin, and that the ratio of the effect of dibasic to that of mono-basic acids is approximately 0.66, as Donnan's theory of membrane potentials would demand. 6. If we have a right to conclude from the validity of the valency rule for cataphoretic potentials that the depressing effect of electrolytes on the cataphoretic
