Bcl-2 is critical for tumorigenesis. However, previous studies on the association of Bcl-2 promoter polymorphisms with predisposition to different cancer types are somewhat contradictory. Therefore, we performed this meta-analysis regarding the relationship between Bcl-2 promoter single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and cancer susceptibility and prognosis. Up to August 2016, 32 original publications were identified covering two Bcl-2 promoter SNPs (rs2279115 and rs1801018). Our results showed statistically significant association between rs2279115 and cancer susceptibility and prognosis in all four genetic models but not in rs1801018. Subgroups analysis indicated that rs2279115 was associated with a significantly higher risk of cancer susceptibility in Asia but not in Caucasian. Furthermore, rs2279115 was associated with a significantly higher risk in digestive system cancer and endocrine system cancer but not in breast cancer, respiratory cancer and hematopoietic cancer. Simultaneously, rs2279115 was correlated with a significantly higher risk of cancer prognosis in Asia but not in Caucasian. Considering these promising results, rs2279115 may be a tumor marker for cancertherapy in Asia. Sensitivity analysis show four gene model were stable, and no publication bias was observed in all four gene model. Large sample size, different ethnic population and different cancer type are warranted to validate this association.
