 used in these experiments multiplies in distilled water at pH 6.0 and pH 8.0 and in Ringer-Locke solution at pH 6.0. Under all the other conditions studied the numbers decrease with the passage of time. 2. The electrophoretic charge of the cells is highest in distilled water at pH 6.0 and pH 8.0. Under all other conditions studied the velocity of migration is decreased, but the decrease is immediate and is not affected by more prolonged exposure. 3. A strongly acid solution (pH 2.0) causes a rapid death of the cells and a sharp decrease in electrophoretic charge, sometimes leading to complete reversal. 4. A strongly alkaline solution (pH 11.0) is almost as toxic as a strongly acid one, although in distilled water the organisms survive fairly well at this reaction. Electrophoretic charge, on the other hand, is only slightly reduced in such an alkaline medium. 5. In distilled water, reactions near the neutral point are about equally favorable to both viability and electrophoretic charge, pH 8.0 showing slightly greater multiplication and a slightly higher charge than pH 11.0. In the presence of salts, however, pH 8.0 is much less favorable to viability and somewhat more favorable to electrophoretic charge than is pH 6.0. 6. Sodium chloride solutions, in the concentrations studied, all proved somewhat toxic and all tended to depress electrophoretic charge. Very marked toxicity was, however, exhibited only in a concentration of .725
