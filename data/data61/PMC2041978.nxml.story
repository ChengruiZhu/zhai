Retroviral recombination, a process akin to sexual reproduction in higher organisms, may accelerate the accumulation of mutations and the development of multi-drug resistance in HIV patients. Recombination occurs when the enzyme reverse transcriptase switches between the two RNA strands of a virion, yielding a provirus that is a mosaic of the two strands. The latter strands are often distinct, thereby allowing recombinational diversification, when multiple viruses infect individual cells. The enormous HIV recombination rate and recent evidence of frequent multiple infections of cells render recombination a powerful force underlying the development of multi-drug resistance in vivo. The dynamics of the emergence of recombinant genomes, however, remains poorly understood. Recent experiments allow a closer look at HIV recombination: cells are exposed to two kinds of reporter viruses and the frequency of recombinant proviruses is detected, which enables direct quantification of the extent of recombination. The observations, however, are not described by available models, leaving a gap in our understanding of HIV recombination. We present a model that describes HIV dynamics with multiple infections of cells and recombination, captures several recent experimental observations quantitatively, provides insights into HIV recombination, and presents a framework for describing the development of multi-drug resistance in HIV patients.
