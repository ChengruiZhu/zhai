Longstanding ulcerative colitis (UC) is a disease of chronic inflammation of the colon. It is associated with the development of colorectal cancer through a multistep process including increasing degrees of dysplasia and DNA-ploidy changes. However, not all UC patients will develop these characteristics even during lifelong disease, and patients may therefore be divided into progressors who develop dysplasia or cancer, and non-progressors who do not exhibit such changes. In the present study, the amount of hTERT, the catalytic subunit of the enzyme telomerase, was estimated by using peroxidase immunohistochemistry (IHC) in a set of progressor and non-progressor UC colectomies. The protein levels in the colonic mucosa of the progressors and non-progressors were compared, and further comparisons between different categories of dysplastic development and to DNA-ploidy status within the progressors were made. Levels of hTERT were elevated in the colonic mucosa of the progressors and non-progressors when compared to non-UC control samples, but no difference was observed between the hTERT levels in the mucosa of progressors and non-progressors. The levels of hTERT associated with levels of Ki67 to a significant degree within the non-progressors. hTERT expression in lesions with DNA-aneuploidy were decreased as compared to diploid lesions, when stratified for different classes of colonic morphology. Our results indicate an association between hTERT protein expression and aneuploidy in UC-progressor colons, and also a possible protective mechanism in the association between hTERT and Ki67, against development of malignant features within the mucosa of a UC-colon.
