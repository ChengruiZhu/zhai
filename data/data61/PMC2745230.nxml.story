Quantitative major polyacetylenes of carrots (falcarinol and falcarindiol) and American ginseng roots (falcarinol and panaxydol) were isolated and tested in human intestinal epithelial cells of normal (FHs 74 Int.) and cancer (Caco-2) origin. A hormesis effect was seen for all isolated polyacetylenes when added to Caco-2 cells in concentrations ranging from 1 ng/mL to 20 μg/mL. The relative inhibitory potency was falcarinol > panaxydol > falcarindiol. No hormesis effect was observed when adding the polyacetylenes to FHs 74 Int. cells. Instead, an inhibitory growth response was observed above 1 μg/mL. The relative inhibitory potency was panaxydol > falcarinol > falcarindiol. Maximal inhibition at 20 μg/mL corresponded to approximately 95% and 80% inhibition of cell proliferation in normal and cancer cells, respectively. Combinations of falcarinol and falcarindiol added to normal and cancer cells showed a synergistic response for the inhibition of cell growth. Furthermore, the oxidized form of falcarinol, falcarinon, showed a significantly less growth inhibitory effect in intestinal cells of both normal and cancer origin; hence, a hydroxyl group at C-3 may be important for activity of falcarinol-type polyacetylenes. Extracts of carrots, containing different amounts of falcarinol, falcarindiol, and falcarindiol 3-acetate had significant inhibitory effects on both normal and cancer cell proliferation. In cancer cells, the extract containing the highest concentration of falcarinol tended to have the highest growth inhibitory effect, in accordance with a higher potency of falcarinol than falcarindiol. The present study demonstrates that aliphatic C
