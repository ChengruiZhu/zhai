Acute necrotizing pancreatitis (ANP) is a common severe critical illness with a high mortality rate. Resveratrol, a polyphenol compound derived from various plants such as grape skin, peanut, berry and veratrum, exhibits multiple biological activities, especially potent anti-inflammatory activity, but its effect on ANP has not yet been fully elucidated. The present study aimed to investigate the effects of resveratrol on L-arginine-induced ANP and the possible mechanisms. A mouse model of ANP was established by 2 hourly intraperitoneal injections of 8% L-arginine (4 g/kg). Then the mice were treated by intragastric administration of resveratrol (80 mg/kg) every 12 h immediately after the second injection of L-arginine. Mice with ANP showed increased apoptosis of pancreatic acinar cells, pancreatic myeloperoxidase activity, serum lactate dehydrogenase activity, amylase, tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), interleukin-6 (IL-6) levels as well as decreased serum IL-10 level, pancreatic expression of heat shock factor 1 (HSF1), sirtuin 1 (SIRT1) and p53, but the ratio of acetylated HSF1 and p53 was markedly increased. Resveratrol enhanced the survival rate of mice with ANP from 47.8 to 71.4% and obviously restored the changes in mice with ANP as mentioned above. Additionally, interactions between SIRT1 and p53 and between SIRT1 and HSF1 in the pancreas of the mice were confirmed by co-immunoprecipitation. These data suggest that resveratrol protects against L-arginine-induced ANP, which may be related to the enhancement of SIRT1-mediated deacetylation of p53 and HSF1.
