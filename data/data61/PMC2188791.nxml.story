We have shown that two weakly immunogenic MCA sarcomas developed in our laboratory that are sensitive to high-dose IL-2 immunotherapy express class I MHC in vivo and in vitro. Two nonimmunogenic MCA sarcomas are relatively insensitive to IL-2 therapy and express minimal or no class I MHC molecules in vivo and in vitro. To study the role of MHC in the therapy of tumors with IL-2, a class I-deficient murine melanoma, B16BL6, was transfected with the Kb class I gene. Expression of class I MHC rendered B16BL6 advanced pulmonary macrometastases sensitive to IL- 2 immunotherapy. 3-d micrometastases of CL8-2, a class I transfected clone of B16BL6, were significantly more sensitive to IL-2 therapy than a control nontransfected line. Expression of Iak, a class II MHC molecule, had no effect on IL-2 therapy of transfectant pulmonary micrometastases in F1 mice. By using lymphocyte subset depletion with mAbs directed against Lyt-2, therapy of class I transfectant macrometastases with high-dose IL-2 was shown to involve an Lyt-2 cell. In contrast, regression of micrometastases treated with low-dose IL-2 involved Lyt-2+ cells, but regression mediated by high doses of IL-2 did not. We hypothesize that both LAK and Lyt-2+ T cells effect IL-2- mediated elimination of micrometastases, but only Lyt-2+ T cells are involved in macrometastatic regression. Low doses of IL-2 stimulate Lyt- 2+ cells to eliminate class I-expressing micrometastases, but high doses of IL-2 can recruit LAK cells to mediate regression of micrometastases independent of class I expression. Only high-dose IL-2, mediating its effect predominantly via Lyt-2+ cells, is capable of impacting on MHC class I-expressing macrometastases. Macrometastases devoid of class I MHC antigens appear to be resistant to IL-2 therapy.
