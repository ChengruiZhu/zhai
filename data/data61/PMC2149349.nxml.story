Previously we found that α3β1 integrin–deficient neonatal mice develop micro-blisters at the epidermal–dermal junction. These micro-blisters were associated with poor basement membrane organization. In the present study we have investigated the effect of α3β1-deficiency on other keratinocyte integrins, actin-associated proteins and F-actin organization. We show that the absence of α3β1 results in an increase in stress fiber formation in keratinocytes grown in culture and at the basal face of the basal keratinocytes of α3-null epidermis. Moreover, we see a higher concentration of actin-associated proteins such as vinculin, talin, and α-actinin at focal contact sites in the α3-deficient keratinocytes. These changes in focal contact composition were not due to a change in steady-state levels of these proteins, but rather to reorganization due to α3β1 deficiency. Apart from the loss of α3β1 there is no change in expression of the other integrins expressed by the α3-null keratinocytes. However, in functional assays, α3β1 deficiency allows an increase in fibronectin and collagen type IV receptor activities. Thus, our findings provide evidence for a role of α3β1 in regulating stress fiber formation and as a trans-dominant inhibitor of the functions of the other integrins in mouse keratinocytes. These results have potential implications for the regulation of keratinocyte adhesion and migration during wound healing.
