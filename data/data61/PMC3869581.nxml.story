Previous studies have indicated that there may be a relationship between the salivary fluoride concentrations and dental caries while the emphasis was on dental caries in permanent teeth. The aim of this study was to assess the prevalence of dental caries and its predictors in 3-6 year-old children in Tehran, Iran. The other objective of this investigation was to clarify a relationship between salivary fluoride levels of the studied children and their socioeconomic situations. The study population consisted of 205 children aged 3-6 years living in Tehran. Each child was examined for dental caries (decayed missing filled teeth (DMFT)) and unstimulated whole mixed saliva was collected 2 h post-prandial. All of the saliva samples were analyzed for fluoride concentration using an ion-specific electrode. The children were then grouped according to their DMFT, salivary fluoride levels (ppm) and socioeconomic factors (parent’s education and occupation) that resulted in a statistically significant relationship. The children with (DMFT < 1) were shown to have a significantly higher salivary fluoride level (p < 0.001) than prone children caries (DMFT > 1). The obtained results indicated that the caries prevalence among 3-6 year-old children in Tehran – the capital of the Islamic republic of Iran – is as low compared with those, living in developed countries.
