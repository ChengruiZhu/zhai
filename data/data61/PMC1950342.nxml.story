Perceptual learning improves sensory stimulus discrimination by repeated practicing. The improved stimulus discrimination is often thought to arise either from modified stimulus representation in the sensory cortex, or from modified readout from the sensory cortex by higher cortical units. Both explanations, the modified sensory representation and the modified readout, have their advantages and disadvantages. Modifying the stimulus representation within the early sensory cortex may lead to an improvement on one discrimination task, but may have long-lasting negative effects on another task. Modifying the task-specific readout by a higher cortical area, on the other hand, prevents this undesirable interplay between tasks. However, it may be difficult for the readout units to compensate for stimulus distortions produced by interactions in the sensory cortex. Here we show that top-down modulation of the early stimulus representation combines the benefits of task specificity and of eliminating inherent distortions. The task specificity naturally arises from distinct task representations in the higher cortical areas which, by top-down signaling, reversibly improve the task-related representation of sensory stimuli. Based on a visual brightness discrimination task, we show that modifying top-down projections alone can explain psychophysical and electrophysiological data on perceptual learning.
