The increase of proteinâ€“protein interaction (PPI) data of different species makes it possible to identify common subnetworks (conserved protein complexes) across species via local alignment of their PPI networks, which benefits us to study biological evolution. Local alignment algorithms compare PPI network of different species at both protein sequence and network structure levels. For computational and biological reasons, it is hard to find common subnetworks with strict similar topology from two input PPI networks. Consequently some methods introduce less strict criteria for topological similarity. However those methods fail to consider the differences of the two input networks and adopt equally lenient criteria on them. In this work, a new dividing-and-matching-based method, namely UEDAMAlign is proposed to detect conserved protein complexes. This method firstly uses known protein complexes or computational methods to divide one of the two input PPI networks into subnetworks and then maps the proteins in these subnetworks to the other PPI network to get their homologous proteins. After that, UEDAMAlign conducts unequally lenient criteria on the two input networks to find common connected components from the proteins in the subnetworks and their homologous proteins in the other network. We carry out network alignments between
