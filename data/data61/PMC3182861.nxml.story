The dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus (dLGN) is a part of the visual thalamus. This region contains two types of neurons: thalamocortical neurons and local interneurons. Thalamocortical neurons receive information from the retina and transmit information to visual cortex. The interneurons regulate the activity of thalamocortical neurons through inhibitory connections. This regulation is not properly understood, but it is believed to promote contrast enhancement and other vital visual functions. A powerful tool for development of a mechanistic understanding of dLGN functions is computer models that include the involved neurons, their interconnections and their interactions. Quite sophisticated models are available for thalamocortical neurons, but previous interneuron models are too simple for adequate mechanistic understanding of the functional properties of interneurons. We here present a detailed compartmental interneuron-model based on experimental data. The typical response patterns vary between different interneurons, but also within a given neuron, depending on the stimulus it receives. The model identifies a set of ionic mechanisms that can explain this diversity of activity patterns. In addition to being a useful building block for future network simulations of the dLGN, the model gives useful insight into the operating principles of dLGN interneurons.
