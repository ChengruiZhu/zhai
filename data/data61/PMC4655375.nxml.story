The p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) plays a key role in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced signal transduction pathways that lead to inflammatory cytokine synthesis in macrophages; however, whether the inhibition of p38 MAPK regulates LPS-induced inflammatory cytokine expression in different types of macrophages remains the subject of debate. Herein, we assessed whether the inhibition of p38 MAPK by SB203580 regulates LPS-induced expression of the inflammatory cytokines tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α) and interleukin 6 (IL-6) in RAW264.7 and resident peritoneal macrophages. Lipopolysaccharide stimulation of RAW264.7 macrophages or mouse resident peritoneal macrophages significantly increased TNF-α and IL-6 production. The addition of SB203580 to cultures dramatically blocked LPS-induced TNF-α production in RAW264.7 and mouse resident peritoneal macrophages, and dramatically blocked LPS-induced IL-6 production in RAW264.7 macrophages, but not in mouse resident peritoneal macrophages. Additionally, high concentrations of SB203580 resulted in increased IL-6 production. However, LPS-stimulation significantly up-regulated the mRNA transcript levels of TNF-α and IL-6 in RAW264.7 and mouse resident peritoneal macrophages, whereas pretreatment with SB203580 dramatically down-regulated LPS-induced mRNA transcript levels of TNF-α and IL-6 in these cells. Our data show that SB203580 differentially modulates LPS-induced production of the inflammatory cytokine IL-6 in two different sources of macrophages, and that this course of regulation occurs at the IL-6 mRNA post-transcriptional stage.
