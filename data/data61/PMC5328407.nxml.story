Research to date has identified many genetic variants that are more common in people with a particular disease. However, in conditions that reflect multiple genetic and environmental factors, it is difficult to know with certainty if and why any particular genetic variant is causative and the mechanism that may underlie this. Such variants are often outside of protein-coding exons, instead falling in regions that regulate gene expression. In these cases, the genetic variation may alter transcription factor binding and subsequent gene expression. In this study, we have examined how genetic variation affects T-bet binding to DNA, as a key transcriptional regulatory mechanism in the immune response. An inability to mount this response effectively can result in increased susceptibility to infections or cancer, while a response that is too strong, or wrongly targeted, can result in uncontrolled/chronic inflammatory and autoimmune conditions. We have found that T-bet binding sites are specifically enriched in genetic variants associated with the mucosal autoinflammatory diseases UC, Crohnâ€™s disease and celiac disease. We also identify genetic variants that alter T-bet binding and gene expression. This discovery thus identifies a molecular mechanism through which genetic variants can be associated with increased risk of mucosal autoimmune disease.
