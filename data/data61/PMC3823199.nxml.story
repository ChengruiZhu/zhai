 activation of protein kinase A (PKA), here we addressed the role of the novel cAMP-mediated exchange protein Epac in the regulation of airway smooth muscle tone. Isometric tension measurements showed that specific activation of Epac led to relaxation of guinea pig tracheal preparations pre-contracted with methacholine, independently of PKA. In airway smooth muscle cells, Epac activation reduced methacholine-induced MLC phosphorylation. Moreover, when Epac was stimulated, we observed a decreased methacholine-induced RhoA activation, measured by both stress fibre formation and pull-down assay whereas the same Epac activation prevented methacholine-induced Rac1 inhibition measured by pull-down assay. Epac-driven inhibition of both methacholine-induced muscle contraction by Toxin B-1470, and MLC phosphorylation by the Rac1-inhibitor NSC23766, were significantly attenuated, confirming the importance of Rac1 in Epac-mediated relaxation. Importantly, human airway smooth muscle tissue also expresses Epac, and Epac activation both relaxed pre-contracted human tracheal preparations and decreased MLC phosphorylation. Collectively, we show that activation of Epac relaxes airway smooth muscle by decreasing MLC phosphorylation by skewing the balance of RhoA/Rac1 activation towards Rac1. Therefore, activation of Epac may have therapeutical potential in the treatment of obstructive airway diseases.
