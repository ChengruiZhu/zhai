Retroperitoneal tumors are lesions with diverse pathological subtypes that originate from the retroperitoneal space; ~40% of these tumors are benign. Due to such lesions often surrounding and associating with vital abdominal blood vessels, a complete surgical resection is difficult. The current study presents a novel surgical approach, known as fractionation, through which a benign retroperitoneal tumor surrounding important abdominal blood vessels was completely resected. A 21-year-old man was admitted to The First Affiliated Hospital of Chongqing Medical University (Chongqing, China), presenting with a ~7.5Ã—7.2-cm tumor that was located in the retroperitoneal pancreatic head region and the first hepatic hilum. The tumor completely surrounded the celiac axis and the splenic, common hepatic and superior mesenteric arteries, and was closely associated with the abdominal aorta and the portal, splenic, superior mesenteric and left renal veins. A pre-operative computed tomography scan and intraoperative frozen biopsy indicated that the lesion was a benign tumor. A fractionation approach was subsequently adopted, with fractionation of the lesion being performed according to the location of the tumor itself and the direction of the surrounding abdominal blood vessels. In this manner, a complete tumor resection was conducted. Post-operative pathological examination confirmed the diagnosis of a retroperitoneal ganglioneuroma. The patient was followed up for a year and a half, with no evidence of tumor recurrence. In the present case, a fractionation approach for the complete resection of the retroperitoneal benign tumor achieved a positive outcome and demonstrated the feasibility of the technique.
