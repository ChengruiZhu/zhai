 mice were randomly assigned to either sedentary (Sed) or exercise (Ex) treatment (n=6–9/group). The exercise treatment consisted of treadmill running for 1 h/day and 6 days a week at 15 m/min from 4 until 16 weeks of age. Intestinal polyps were counted and categorized by size. Mucosal tissue was analyzed for mRNA expression of overall macrophages (F4/80), for genes associated with M1 (IL-12, IL-23 and Nos2) and M2 (CD206, IL-10, IL-4, CCL17, CCL22 and Arg-1) macrophages and the macrophage chemoattractants MCP-1, fetuin A and CXCL14. Markers for cytotoxic T cells (CTLs) and regulatory T cells were also examined by measuring mRNA expression of CD8 and Foxp3, respectively. While there was no significant difference in overall polyp number between the groups (Sed, 23.3±4.3; and Ex, 16.5±4.3), Ex did have a reduction in the number of large polyps (Sed, 6.1±1.1; and Ex, 3.0±0.6) (P<0.05). This was consistent with a decrease in spleen weight (P<0.05). Similarly, Ex reduced mRNA expression of overall macrophages (F4/80) as well as markers associated with both M1 (IL-12) and M2 (CD206, CCL22 and Arg-1) subtypes (P<0.05) but there was no significant decrease in macrophage chemoattractants. CD8 expression was increased while Foxp3 expression was decreased with Ex (P<0.05). Overall the data provide important new information on immune regulation as a possible mechanism for the documented benefits of exercise training on reducing colon cancer progression.
