In this report, we examine the functional significance of the molecular microheterogeneity of alpha-fetoprotein (AFP). In doing so, we have taken the direct approach of purifying the naturally occurring isomeric forms of fetal-derived AFP using a preparative anion exchange column linked to an automated fast protein liquid chromatography (FPLC) system followed by parallel testing of each isolated molecular variant for in vitro immunoregulatory activity. The data obtained demonstrate the presence of seven distinct variants of AFP as defined by their retention volumes on FPLC elution profiles, by their pIs on analytical IEF gels, and by Western blot analysis. Molecular mass determination by SDS-PAGE showed each isomer to be equivalent in size to 69,000-dalton native unfractionated AFP molecules. All the immunosuppressive activity of AFP was localized to a single variant representing only 6% of the total composition of native AFP. The immunoregulating isomer termed AFP- 1 was the least acidic of the seven isolated variants with a pI of 5.1 and displayed a sialic acid content of 1 mol/mol of protein. The inhibitory activity of AFP-1 could be readily measured on T cell- dependent antibody synthesis, Con A-induced stimulation of Lyt-1+23- thymocyte DNA synthesis, and lymphokine-activated NK cell activity. All other isomers were without effect in these test systems. The immunosuppressive AFP-1 isomer also displayed the strongest growth- promoting influence on cultured bone marrow lymphocytes. There was no correlation between functional activity and degree of expression of sialic acid residues on the AFP molecules. These findings demonstrate that the immunoregulating function of AFP is confined to a distinct and relatively small subpopulation of native AFP molecules and should therefore contribute to the resolution of outstanding questions regarding the structure/function relationship of this onco-fetal glycoprotein.
