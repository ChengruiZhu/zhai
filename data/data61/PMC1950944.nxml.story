X chromosome inactivation is a mechanism to compensate gene dosage difference between XY males and XX females in mammals. During early embryogenesis, one of two X chromosomes in every female cell is inactivated, and the inactive X chromosome is stably inherited through cell divisions of somatic cells. Although precise timing is not given, the inactive X chromosome is known to be reactivated during germ cell development. It is generally believed that the dynamics of X chromosome activity is tightly correlated with major genomic reprogramming events occurring during mammalian development. Therefore, elucidation of the X reactivation kinetics is important for understanding the mechanism of X chromosome inactivation/reactivation processes and the epigenetic reprogramming processes as well. Here we investigated when X reactivation is initiated during development of female mouse germ cells. Contrary to the previous suggestions, X reactivation already begins in nascent primordial germ cells in female mice and proceeds gradually requiring a prolonged period. The activity status of the X chromosomes of germ cells appears to vary from cell-to-cell and from gene-to-gene during the reactivation processes. These results indicate that the X reactivation coincides with the formation of germ cells and suggest that this involves slow passive steps.
