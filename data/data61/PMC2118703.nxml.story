CD8 T cells are nature's foremost defense in encephalitis and brain tumors. Antigen-specific CD8 T cells need to enter the brain to exert their beneficial effects. On the other hand, traffic of CD8 T cells specific for neural antigen may trigger autoimmune diseases like multiple sclerosis. T cell traffic into the central nervous system is thought to occur when activated T cells cross the blood-brain barrier (BBB) regardless of their antigen specificity, but studies have focused on CD4 T cells. Here, we show that selective traffic of antigen-specific CD8 T cells into the brain occurs in vivo and is dependent on luminal expression of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I by cerebral endothelium. After intracerebral antigen injection, using a minimally invasive technique, transgenic CD8 T cells only infiltrated the brain when and where their cognate antigen was present. This was independent of antigen presentation by perivascular macrophages. Marked reduction of antigen-specific CD8 T cell infiltration was observed after intravenous injection of blocking antiâ€“MHC class I antibody. These results expose a hitherto unappreciated route by which CD8 T cells home onto their cognate antigen behind the BBB: luminal MHC class I antigen presentation by cerebral endothelium to circulating CD8 T cells. This has implications for a variety of diseases in which antigen-specific CD8 T cell traffic into the brain is a beneficial or deleterious feature.
