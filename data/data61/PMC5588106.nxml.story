We analyzed the improvement of survival time and the effects of neoadjuvant chemotherapy combined with radiotherapy on treating patients with advanced esophageal carcinoma. Retrospectively, 43 patients were selected with esophageal carcinoma who were administered neoadjuvant chemotherapy combined with radiotherapy. According to gender, and tumor staging, the nearest neighbor matching was carried out. Eighty-six patients (1:2) who received neoadjuvant chemotherapy and 129 patients (1:3) who underwent surgery only were taken and compared for clinical outcomes. It was found that in the combination group, the median survival time was prolonged and the 1-year survival rate improved. The diameter of tumors was significantly reduced, and the surgical resection, margin negative and total effective rates improved. In addition, the recurrence rate significantly decreased, whereas quality of life scores significantly increased (p<0.05). The comparison of overall incidence of complications was not statistically significant (p>0.05). Tumor staging, location, and diameter after neoadjuvant therapy, as well as therapeutic regimen, treatment cycle, margin negative rate and effective rate were independent risk factors for significantly influencing survival outcomes and time (p<0.05). In conclusion, neoadjuvant chemotherapy combined with radiotherapy can be utilized to treat advanced esophageal carcinoma improve survival time and promote prognosis.
