The aim of this manuscript is to describe radiological findings of extra-pulmonary sarcoidosis. Sarcoidosis is an immune-mediated systemic disease of unknown origin, characterized by non-caseating epitheliod granulomas. Ninety percent of patients show granulomas located in the lungs or in the related lymph nodes. However, lesions can affect any organ. Typical imaging features of liver and spleen sarcoidosis include visceromegaly, with multiple nodules hypodense on CT images and hypointense on T2-weighted MRI acquisitions. Main clinical and radiological manifestations of renal sarcoidosis are nephrolithiasis, nephrocalcinosis, and acute interstitial nephritis. Brain sarcoidosis shows multiple or solitary parenchymal nodules on MRI that enhance with a ring-like appearance after gadolinium. In spinal cord localization, MRI demonstrates enlargement and hyperintensity of spinal cord, with hypointense lesions on T2-weighted images. Skeletal involvement is mostly located in small bone, showing many lytic lesions; less frequently, bone lesions have a sclerotic appearance. Ocular involvement includes uveitis, conjunctivitis, optical nerve disease, chorioretinis. Erythema nodosum and lupus pernio represent the most common cutaneous manifestations encountered. Sarcoidosis in various organs can be very insidious for radiologists, showing different imaging features, often non-specific. Awareness of these imaging features helps radiologists to obtain the correct diagnosis.
