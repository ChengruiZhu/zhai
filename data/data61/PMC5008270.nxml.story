Human platelets were identified in tumors by Trousseau in 1865, although their roles in tumor microenvironments have only recently attracted the attention of cancer researchers. In this study we exploit and enhance platelet interactions in tumor microenvironments by introducing tumor-targeting and imaging functions. The first step in repurposing human platelets as vehicles for tumor-targeting was to inhibit platelet-aggregation by cytoplasmic-loading of kabiramide (KabC), a potent inhibitor of actin polymerization and membrane protrusion. KabC-Platelets can accumulate high levels of other membrane-permeable cytoxins and probes, including epidoxorubicin, carboxyfluorescein di-ester and chlorin-e6. Finally, mild reaction conditions were developed to couple tumor-targeting proteins and antibodies to KabC-platelets. Fluorescence microscopy studies showed KabC-platelets, surface-coupled with transferrin and Cy5, bind specifically to RPMI8226 and K562 cells, both of which over-express the transferrin receptor. Repurposed platelets circulate for upto 9-days a feature that increases their chance of interacting with target cells. KabC-platelets, surface-coupled with transferrin and Cy7, or chlorin-e6, and injected in immuno-compromised mice were shown to accumulate specifically in sub-cutaneous and intra-cranial myeloma xenotransplants. The high-contrast,
