Stathmin is closely correlated with the progression and prognosis of a number of types of human cancer. The present study analyzed the associations between genetic variations in the stathmin gene and clinical outcomes of ovarian cancer. A total of 178 patients with epithelial ovarian cancer were treated with cytoreductive surgery followed by platinum-based chemotherapy. DNA was extracted from fresh tumor samples obtained during surgery. A total of 32 DNA samples were selected randomly for resequencing of the stathmin gene. Tag single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were identified based on the haplotype model as analyzed by PolyPhred software. Direct sequencing was employed in the genotyping of stathmin in 178 cases. A total of 10 nucleotide variations in stathmin were identified, of which 3 high-frequency variations were known SNPs from databases and 7 were new variations with low frequencies. The tag SNPs rs159531 and rs11376635 were selected from the linkage disequilibrium block of the gene to genotype stathmin in 178 cases. The distribution of the rs159531 genotype in ovarian cancer was 52.8% C/C, 35.4% C/T and 11.2% T/T. The distribution of the rs11376635 genotype in ovarian cancer was 32.0% G/G, 48.3% G/-, 18.5% -/-. The main haplotypes calculated by phase2.0 software were 55.6% CG, 27.8% T-, 15.4% C- and 1.2% TG. However, no associations between the stathmin genotype or haplotype and the outcomes in patients with ovarian cancer were observed. The stathmin genotype and haplotype were not associated with the phenotype of patients with ovarian cancer.
