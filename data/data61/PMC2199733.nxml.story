To define the molecular basis of this negative transmodulation of EGFR signaling, we found that IP-10 did not adversely impact receptor or immediate postreceptor signaling as determined by tyrosyl phosphorylation of EGFR and two major downstream effectors phospholipase C-γ and erk mitogen-activated protein kinases. Morphological studies suggested which biophysical steps may be affected by demonstrating that IP-10 treatment resulted in an elongated cell morphology reminiscent of failure to detach the uropod; in support of this, IP-10 pretreatment inhibited EGF-induced cell detachment. These data suggested that calpain activity may be involved. The cell permeant agent, calpain inhibitor I, limited EGF-induced motility and de-adhesion similarly to IP-10. IP-10 also prevented EGF- induced calpain activation (reduced by 71 ± 7%). That this inhibition of EGF-induced calpain activity was secondary to IP-10 initiating a cAMP-protein kinase A-calpain cascade is supported by the following evidence: (a) the cell permeant analogue 8-(4-chlorophenylthio)-cAMP (CPT-cAMP) prevented EGF-induced calpain activity and motility; (b) other ELR-negative CXC chemokines, monokine induced by IFN-γ and platelet factor 4 that also generate cAMP, inhibited EGF-induced cell migration and calpain activation; and (c) the protein kinase A inhibitor Rp-8-Br-cAMPS abrogated IP-10 inhibition of cell migration, cell detachment, and calpain activation. Our findings provide a model by which IP-10 suppresses EGF-induced cell motility by inhibiting EGF-induced detachment of the trailing edges of motile cells.
