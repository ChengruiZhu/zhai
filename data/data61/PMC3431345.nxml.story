Unraveling how interfaces of protein complexes coevolved is of major importance to improve our ability to predict their structures and design novel binders. Proteins whose interaction was maintained throughout evolution generally have their homologs binding in a similar manner while their sequences can have significantly diverged. Constraints holding proteins together should be captured from the growing body of available multiple sequence alignments. However, it remains unclear which features of the interfaces provide most tolerance to mutations and it is unknown whether any invariant properties may help to extract meaningful signals from sequence alignments. To solve this issue, we tackled an unprecedented large scale analysis of more than 1000 non-redundant couples of structural interologs. Structural interologs are pairs of complexes of known structure whose chains are homologs. We quantitatively measured how the networks of contacts varied between two interfaces. Although highly versatile, we found that contact networks were more conserved for residues acting as anchors and for apolar contacts when they are clustered into surface patches. Altogether, our results provide major guidelines for exploiting the wealth of evolutionary information contained in the sequences of binding partners. On those bases we developed a method to predict which residues most likely conserve their contacts.
