To determine the time course of synaptic differentiation, we made successive observations on identified, nerve-contacted muscle cells developing in culture. The cultures had either been stained with fluorescent alpha-bungarotoxin, or were maintained in the presence of a fluorescent monoclonal antibody. These probes are directed at acetylcholine receptors (AChR) and a basal lamina proteoglycan, substances that show nearly congruent surface organizations at the adult neuromuscular junction. In other experiments individual muscle cells developing in culture were selected at different stages of AChR accumulation and examined in the electron microscope after serial sectioning along the entire path of nerve-muscle contact. The results indicate that the nerve-induced formation of AChR aggregates and adjacent plaques of proteoglycan is closely coupled throughout early stages of synapse formation. Developing junctional accumulations of AChR and proteoglycan appeared and grew progressively, throughout a perineural zone that extended along the muscle surface for several micrometers on either side of the nerve process. Unlike junctional AChR accumulations, which disappeared within a day of denervation, both junctional and extrajunctional proteoglycan deposits were stable in size and morphology. Junctional proteoglycan deposits appeared to correspond to discrete ultrastructural plaques of basal lamina, which were initially separated by broad expanses of lamina-free muscle surface. The extent of this basal lamina, and a corresponding thickening of the postsynaptic membrane, also increased during the accumulation of AChR and proteoglycan along the path of nerve contact. Presynaptic differentiation of synaptic vesicle clusters became detectable at the developing neuromuscular junction only after the formation of postsynaptic plaques containing both AChR and proteoglycan. It is concluded that motor nerves induce a gradual formation and growth of AChR aggregates and stable basal lamina proteoglycan deposits on the muscle surface during development of the neuromuscular junction.
