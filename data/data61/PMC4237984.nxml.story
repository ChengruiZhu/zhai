As a ligand-dependent transcription factor of the nuclear hormone receptor superfamily, the pregnane X receptor (PXR) has a multitude of functions including regulating xenobiotic and cholesterol metabolism, energy homeostasis, gut mucosal defense, and cancer development. Whereas the detoxification functions of PXR have been widely studied and well established, the role of PXR in cancer has become controversial. With more than 60% of non-prescription and prescription drugs being metabolized by cytochrome P450 enzyme 3A4 (CYP3A4), a transcriptional target of PXR, insights into the regulation of PXR during systemic administration of novel treatment modalities will lead to a better understanding of PXR function in the context of human disease. Previous studies have suggested that PXR activation decreases drug sensitivity and augments chemoresistance in certain colon cancers mainly through the upregulation of CYP3A4 and multidrug resistance protein-1 (MDR1). Later studies suggest that downregulation of PXR expression may be oncogenic in hormone-dependent breast and endometrial cancers by reducing estrogen metabolism via CYP3A4; thus, higher estradiol concentrations contribute to carcinogenesis. These results suggest a differential role of PXR in tumor growth regulation dependent on tissue type and tumor microenvironment. Here, we will summarize the various mechanisms utilized by PXR to induce its diverse effects on cancerous tissues. Moreover, current approaches will be explored to evaluate the exploitation of PXR-mediated pathways as a novel mechanistic approach to cancer therapy.
