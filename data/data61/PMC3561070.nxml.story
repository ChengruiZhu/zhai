Damaging mutations in single genes are an important source of information about the causes of disease, including more complex genetic disease; but these single gene disorders are typically rare in humans. An important strategy for identifying new disease mechanisms is to introduce multiple random mutations in mice and test the mice for biological differences; these mice act as models of human disease. However, discovering the disease-causing mutation is time-consuming and complex, requiring further generations of breeding. In this study we demonstrate a method that overcomes these problems by sequencing the entire genomes of multiple mice that have inherited a disease-causing mutation from a common ancestor. We use an algorithm that uses knowledge of all the mutations carried by the sequenced mice to identify the regions of the genome and mutations that are common to all the mice. Using this method we can rapidly link biological traits to genetic mutations. In contrast to current approaches, our strategy does not require large amounts of breeding, and it permits more accurate measurement of a wider range of traits; consequently its introduction will significantly reduce the number of mice required in the future, increase the number of traits that can be detected, and accelerate the discovery of new pathways and gene functions relevant to human diseases.
