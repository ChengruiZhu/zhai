The clinical randomized controlled trials published from inception to March 19, 2015 were identified from The Cochrane Library databases, PUBMED, and EBASE. Randomized controlled trials of at least 8 weeks duration using PCSK9 inhibitors in treating patients with hypercholesterolemia were included. Mean difference (MD) with a 95% CI was used to calculate the continuous data, the standardized mean difference with a 95% CI was used when the unit was not unified, and risk ratio with a 95% CI was used for dichotomous data. After screening, 20 trials fulfilled the inclusion criteria. PCSK9 inhibitors significantly decreased the levels of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (MD=−65.29 mg/dL, 95% CI: −72.08 to −58.49), total cholesterol (MD=−60.04 mg/dL, 95% CI: −69.95 to −50.13), triglycerides (MD=−12.21 mg/dL, 95% CI: −16.21 to −8.22) and apolipoprotein-B (MD=−41.01 mg/dL, 95% CI: −46.07 to −35.94), lipoprotein(a) (standardized mean difference=−0.94, 95% CI: −1.12 to −0.77) and increased the levels of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (MD=3.40 mg/dL, 95% CI: 3.12 to 3.68) and apolipoprotein-A1 (MD=6.75 mg/dL, 95% CI: 4.64 to 8.86). There was no significant difference in the incidence of treatment-emergent adverse events (risk ratio=1.01, 95% CI: 0.98 to 1.04), serious treatment-emergent adverse events (risk ratio=1.01, 95% CI: 0.88 to 1.17), and the discontinuation of treatment between the 2 groups (risk ratio=1.07, 95% CI: 0.86 to 1.34).
