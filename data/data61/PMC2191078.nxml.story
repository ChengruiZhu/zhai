Young adult Lewis rats were maintained on diets containing 0.015 or 0.027% cyclosporin A (CSA) for periods of up to 6 wk. All animals showed complete depletion of medullary thymocytes (CD4+8- and CD4-8+, T cell receptor [TCR] alpha/beta hi, Thy-1med/low, terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase negative [TdT-]) and a 50% reduction in the number of TdT- cortical thymocytes (CD4+8+, TCR alpha/beta low, Thy- 1med) within 1 wk of CSA treatment. In addition, about half of the animals displayed a 50% reduction in the number of TdT+ cortical thymocytes (CD4+8+, TCR alpha/beta low, Thy-1hi). These intrathymic changes were accompanied by a reciprocal increase in the number of double-positive (DP; CD4+8+) T cells in lymph nodes (LN) and spleens. To confirm that the latter T cells were recent thymic emigrants (RTE), CSA-treated rats were injected intrathymically with fluorescein isothiocyanate, and the phenotype of the labeled T cells appearing in LN was determined 16 h later. The results demonstrated that, in addition to those RTE exported in normal animals (> 90% medullary origin), the emigration of DP thymocytes, including large numbers of TdT+ thymocytes, was markedly increased. The presence of TdT+ cells, which normally do not leave the thymus, clearly identifies the DP RTE as originating from the thymus cortex. Intrathymic labeling studies also directly demonstrated that export of all thymocyte subsets ceases within 9 d of CSA treatment; and thymectomy experiments confirmed that the CSA-induced increase in phenotypically immature T cells resulted primarily from the disturbance of thymocyte maturation and emigration, rather than from a direct effect on preexisting T cells. These results suggest that a wave of cortical thymocytes, many of which presumably have not yet undergone negative selection, is released from the thymus during the first week of CSA treatment. The presence of these potentially unselected cells in peripheral lymphoid tissues may help to explain the increased frequency of autoreactive T cells observed in CSA- treated animals.
