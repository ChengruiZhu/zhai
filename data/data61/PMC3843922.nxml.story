From a total of 688 patients included (226 in rural and 462 in urban areas), 76.2% had an ischaemic stroke (IS; 75.3 vs. 77.9%), 16.1% a primary intracerebral haemorrhage (PICH; 16.3 vs. 14.6%) and 3.3% a subarachnoid haemorrhage (SAH; 2.7 vs. 3.7%); in 4.4% (4.9 vs. 4.1%), the stroke type could not be determined. The annual incidence rate per 1,000 was 2.13 (95% CI, 1.95-2.31), 0.45 (95% CI, 0.37-0.53), 0.09 (95% CI, 0.06-0.14) and 0.12 (95% CI, 0.08-0.17), respectively. The age-specific rural/urban incidence rate ratios for IS in the youngest group (<55 years) was 0.27 (95% CI, 0.11-0.69), increasing to 1.47 (95% CI, 1.07-2.01) for those aged 65-74 years and to 1.87 (95% CI, 1.39-2.52) for those between 75 and 84 years. Rural compared to urban patients with an IS were predominantly men, had a prevalence ratio (PR) of 1.28 (95% CI, 1.05-1.56), were 65 years or older (PR = 1.18; 95% CI, 1.08-1.30) and had in general a lower prevalence of risk factors. There was no evidence of rural/urban differences in 28-day case fatality for the stroke types, although IS tended to be less fatal among urban patients (10.3 vs. 13.1%), whereas PICH (33.3 vs. 24.2%) and SAH (35.3 vs. 16.7%) were less fatal among rural patients. Independently of rural/urban residence, predictors of poor survival after the acute phase (28 days) were age >65 years (HR = 3.57; 95% CI, 2.6-4.9), diabetes (HR = 1.5; 95% CI, 1.2-1.9), ischaemic heart disease (HR = 1.8; 95% CI, 1.3-2.6), atrial fibrillation (HR = 1.5; 95% CI, 1.1-2.0) and smoking habits (HR = 1.6; 95% CI, 1.1-2.3).
