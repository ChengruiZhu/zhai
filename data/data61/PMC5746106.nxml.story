Lower available P (aP) was used as a base value in nutritional strategies for mitigating P pollution by animal excreta. We hypothesized that the mechanism regulating phosphate transport under low dietary P might be related with the AMPK signal pathway. A total of 144 one-day-old Arbor Acres Plus broilers were randomly allocated to control (HP) or trial (LP) diets, containing 0.45 and 0.23% aP, respectively. Growth performance, blood, intestinal, and renal samples were tested in 21-day-old broilers. Results shown that LP decreased body weight gain and feed intake. Higher serum Ca and fructose, but lower serum P and insulin were detected in LP-fed broilers. NaPi-IIb mRNA expression in intestine and NaPi-IIa mRNA expression in kidney were higher in the LP group. AMP: ATP, p-AMPK: total AMPK, and p-ACC: total ACC ratios in the duodenal mucosa were decreased in the LP group, whereas the p-mTOR: total mTOR ratio increased. These findings suggested that the increase in phosphate transport owing to LP diet might be regulated either directly by higher mTOR activity or indirectly by the suppressive AMPK signal, with corresponding changes in blood insulin and fructose content. A novel viewpoint on the regulatory mechanism underlying phosphate transport under low dietary P conditions was revealed, which might provide theoretical guidelines for reducing P pollution by means of nutritional regulation.
