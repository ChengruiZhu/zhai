Brassinosteroids (BRs) are a class of steroid hormones regulating a wide range of physiological processes during the plant life cycle from seed development to the modulation of flowering and senescence. The last decades, and recent years in particular, have witnessed a significant advance in the elucidation of the molecular mechanisms of BR signaling from perception by the transmembrane receptor complex to the regulation of transcription factors influencing expression of the target genes. Application of the new approaches shed light on the molecular functions of the key players regulating the BR signaling cascade and allowed identification of new factors. Recent studies clearly indicated that some of the components of BR signaling pathway act as multifunctional proteins involved in other signaling networks regulating diverse physiological processes, such as photomorphogenesis, cell death control, stomatal development, flowering, plant immunity to pathogens and metabolic responses to stress conditions, including salinity. Regulation of some of these processes is mediated through a crosstalk between BR signalosome and the signaling cascades of other hormones, including auxin, abscisic acid, ethylene and salicylic acid. Unravelling the complicated mechanisms of BR signaling and its interconnections with other molecular networks may be of great importance for future practical applications in agriculture.
