The phosphorylated epidermal growth factor receptor (P-EGFR) and phosphorylated Akt (P-Akt) protein in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) were studied, and its significance in clinical prognosis of patients was assessed. The expression of P-EGFR and P-Akt protein in 83 cases of ESCC and 83 normal esophageal tissues was determined by immunohistochemical staining. Log-rank test and correlation analysis were used to analyze the prognosis of ESCC. The positive expression of P-EGFR in ESCC was 88% (73/83 cases) compared with 41% in normal esophageal mucosa (34/83 cases) (P<0.05). The rate of P-Akt protein expression in ESCC was 90.4% (75/83 cases), compared with 27.7% seen in normal esophageal mucosa (23/83 cases) (P<0.05). The expression of P-EGFR and P-Akt protein was positively correlated with lymph node metastasis and degree of differentiation (P<0.05) irrespective of sex, age, tumor diameter and TNM stage (P>0.05). The expression of P-EGFR was positively correlated with that of P-Akt protein (r=0.674, P<0.01). P-EGFR expression was negatively correlated with survival time of patients with ESCC (r=−0.526, P<0.01). The Kaplan-Meier survival curves showed that the cumulative survival rate of P-EGFR-positive cases was significantly lower than that of the P-EGFR-negative cases (P<0.01). The expression of P-Akt was negatively correlated with survival in patients with ESCC (r=−0.473, P<0.01). The Kaplan-Meier survival curves showed that the cumulative survival rate of the P-Akt-positive cases was significantly lower than that of the P-Akt-negative cases (P<0.01). In conclusion, P-EGFR and P-Akt protein expression is closely related to the incidence of ESCC and mediates the development of invasive cancer and metastasis. It is used to determine the prognosis of ESCC, and may represent a new therapeutic target for the disease.
