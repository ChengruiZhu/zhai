Intensity‐modulated radiotherapy treatment demands stringent quality assurance and accurate dose determination for delivery of highly conformal dose to the patients. Generally 3D dose distributions obtained from a treatment planning system have to be verified by dosimetric methods. Mainly, a comparison of two‐dimensional calculated and measured data in several coplanar planes is performed. In principle, there are many possibilities to measure two‐dimensional dose distributions such as films, flat‐panel electronic portal imaging devices (EPID), ion chambers and ionization chamber arrays, and radiographic and radiochromic films. The flat‐panel EPIDs show a good resolution and offer a possibility for real‐time measurements: however to convert the signal into dose, a separate commercial algorithm is required. The 2D ion chamber array system offers the real‐time measurements. In this study, dosimetric characteristics of 2D ion chamber array matrix were analyzed for verification of radiotherapy treatments. The dose linearity and dose rate effect of the I'matriXX device was studied using 6 MV, 18 MV photons and 12 MeV electrons. The output factor was estimated using I'matriXX device and compared with ion chamber measurements. The ion chamber array system was found to be linear in the dose range of 2–500 cGy and the response of the detector was found to be independent of dose rate between . The estimated relative output factor with I'matriXX was found to match very well with the ion chamber measurements. To check the final dose delivered during IMRT planning, dose distribution patterns such as field‐in‐field, pyramidal, and chair tests were generated with the treatment planning system (TPS) and the same was executed in the accelerator and measured with the I'matriXX device. The dose distribution pattern measured by the matrix device for field‐in‐field, pyramidal, and chair test were found to be in good agreement with the calculated dose distribution by TPS both for 6 and 18 MV photons (γ ≤ 1: 96%, criteria 3%, 3 mm). Two 7‐field IMRT plans (one prostate, one head and neck) dose distribution patterns were also measured with I'matriXX device and compared with film dosimetry. The measurements and evaluation proves that I'matriXX can be used for quantifying absolute dose. Moreover, using I'matriXX as absolute dosimeter in IMRT field verification, avoids the time‐consuming procedure of making ionometric measurement for absolute dose estimation and film for dose distribution verification. The I'matriXX can also used for routine quality assurance checks like flatness, symmetry, field width, and penumbra of the linear accelerator beam.
