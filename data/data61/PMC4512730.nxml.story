Generation of self-organized, functional tissue patterns is critical for development and regeneration in multicellular organisms. Small valves on the epidermis of land plants, called stomata, mediate gas-exchange while minimizing water loss. Density and spacing of stomata are regulated by transcription factors that drive differentiation as well as by cell-cell signaling components that regulate entry and spacing of stomatal lineage cells. To unravel how interaction of these components translates into two-dimensional patterning of stomata, we have taken an integrative approach employing molecular genetics, imaging, and mathematical modeling. In this paper we have identified a regulatory circuit controlling the initiation of the stomatal cell lineage. The key elements of the circuit are a positive feedback loop constituting self-activation of the transcription factors SCREAM / SCREAM2 (SCRMs) that requires SPEECHLESS (SPCH), and a negative feedback loop involving the signaling ligand EPF2, the receptor modifier TOO MANY MOUTHS, and the SPCHâ€¢SCRMs module. The receptor ERECTA, on the other hand, lies outside of the regulatory loop. Our mathematical modeling recapitulated all known stomatal phenotypes with the addition of two regulatory nodes. This work highlights the molecular framework of a self-organizing patterning system in plants.
