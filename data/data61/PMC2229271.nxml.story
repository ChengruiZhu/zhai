Purified bovine renal epithelial Na+ channels when reconstituted into planar lipid bilayers displayed a specific orientation when the membrane was clamped to -40 mV (cis-side) during incorporation. The trans-facing portion of the channel was extracellular (i.e., amiloride- sensitive), whereas the cis-facing side was intracellular (i.e., protein kinase A-sensitive). Single channels had a main state unitary conductance of 40 pS and displayed two subconductive states each of 12- 13 pS, or one of 12-13 pS and the second of 24-26 pS. Elevation of the [Na+] gradient from the trans-side increased single-channel open probability (Po) only when the cis-side was bathed with a solution containing low [Na+] (< 30 mM) and 10-100 microM [Ca2+]. Under these conditions, Po saturated with increasing [Na+]trans. Buffering of the cis compartment [Ca2+] to nearly zero (< 1 nM) with 10 mM EGTA increased the initial level of channel activity (Po = 0.12 +/- 0.02 vs 0.02 +/- 0.01 in control), but markedly reduced the influence of both cis- and trans-[Na+] on Po. Elevating [Ca2+]cis at constant [Na+] resulted in inhibition of channel activity with an apparent [KiCa2+] of 10-100 microM. Protein kinase C-induced phosphorylation shifted the dependence of channel Po on [Ca2+]cis to 1-3 microM at stationary [Na+]. The direct modulation of single-channel Po by Na+ and Ca2+ demonstrates that the gating of amiloride-sensitive Na2+ channels is indeed dependent upon the specific ionic environment surrounding the channels.
