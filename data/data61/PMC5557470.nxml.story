The response rates for recognition as a mental health problem was 82.2% (n = 824) for the vignette depicting depression, 68.7% (n = 689) for the psychosis vignette and 62.3% (n = 623) for the social phobia vignette. “Talking to the person”, was responded to as helpful by 49.9% (n = 500), for the depression vignette followed by 49.8% (n = 499) for social phobia, 39.5% (n = 396) for psychosis and 19.5% (n = 195) for the diabetes vignette. The response rate for exercise being a helpful intervention was 25% (n = 251) for the diabetes vignette, followed by 21% (n = 210) for social phobia, 18.7% (n = 187) for psychosis vignette and 18.4% (n = 184) for the depression vignette. While 70.2% (n = 704) responded that there would be benefit in seeing a doctor for the diabetes vignette, the response rates for psychosis was 48.5% (n = 486), and for both depression and social phobia it was 48.2% (n = 483). The responses for the persons in the vignettes becoming better with treatment was 81.4% (n = 816) for the diabetes, 79.5% (n = 797) for depression, 75.6% (n = 758) for psychosis and 63.4% (n = 636) for the social phobia vignette. A statistically significant association was found between the income level of the family and appropriate recognition as mental health problems, for all the 3 mental health related vignettes.
