Although microfracture remains the most common articular cartilage restorative procedure, its rates have been slowly declining since 2009, where as rates of ACI and osteochondral grafting have remained relatively stable (Image). 76,304 microfracture patients, average age 48.3 (SD=13.6), with minimum follow-up of 2 years were examined. 6,366 patients (8.3%) underwent at least one revision cartilage procedure within two years. 93% of these patients had either repeat microfracture or chondroplasty, 4.7% underwent osteochondral grafting, and 2.3% underwent ACI. 1,030 patients (1.3%) required repeat surgery secondary to stiffness or infection: 94% of these patients required manipulation under anesthesia (MUA) and the remaining 6% required open or arthroscopic incision and drainage (I&D). 24,892 patients who underwent microfracture were enrolled for at least 5 years. 428 (1.7%) of these patients subsequently underwent knee arthroplasty within 5 years. Of the 868 patients who underwent ACI as the index procedure, 139 patients (16.0%) underwent a revision cartilage procedure within two years; most commonly chondroplasty (77.8%). Average age of ACI patients was 34.5 (SD=13.5). 46 ACI patients (2.1%) returned to the OR for complications; most commonly MUA for stiffness (98.3%). Of the 233 ACI patients who were enrolled for 5 years, 16 (6.9%) of patients underwent knee arthroplasty. 2,151 patients underwent osteochondral grafting as the index procedure, with the average age being 34.5 (SD=14.1). 331 (15.4%) patients underwent revision cartilage surgery, most commonly arthroscopic chondroplasty (52.6%). 107 (5%) of patients underwent surgery for complications, most commonly MUA (80.3%). Of the 741 patients who underwent osteochondral grafting that were enrolled for 5 years, 16 (2.2%) subsequently underwent conversion to knee arthroplasty.
