The purposes of this study were (1) to describe the relationship between preoperative physical status and postoperative outcomes in patients undergoing Whipple resection, and (2) to determine if the use of specialized immunonutrition with IMPACT Advanced Recovery supplementation improved postoperative outcomes (pancreatic leak rate, length of stay, and postoperative complications) in patients undergoing Whipple resection. The trial was a case-controlled prospective pilot study that took place in an outpatient gastrointestinal surgical oncology office in an urban community hospital in the northeast United States. The study population consisted of nine patients undergoing Whipple surgery. Patients were given IMPACT Advanced Recovery supplementation 4 days prior to Whipple surgery. Prospective data were collected on all patients and then compared to national averages in terms of outcomes. Study approval was obtained from the Fairfield University Institutional Review Board (IRB), though IRB approval was not required by the study facility due to the fact that this was a pilot study. Consent was also not required for retrospective chart review. Patients with lower scores according to the American Society of Anesthesiologists Physical Status Classification System have a shorter operating time in the setting of preoperative nutrition. Patients in this study who received preoperative nutrition with IMPACT Advanced Recovery supplementation had outcomes comparable to the national average. This pilot study suggests that there is a need for a multi-institutional randomized study powered to further evaluate the effectiveness of preoperative nutrition in pancreatic surgery. The literature supports the fact that preoperative nutritional supplementation should be offered to patients undergoing Whipple surgery. Optimization of nutritional status can translate to decreased length of stay and cost savings.
