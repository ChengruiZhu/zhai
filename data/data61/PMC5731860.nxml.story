Curcumin is a promising active compound from a natural source and is extensively being tested in clinical trials because of its bio-functional properties. However, poor bioavailability has hampered its clinical application. Numerous attempts have been made in our laboratory to discover analogs of curcumin with enhanced bioavailability and superior pharmacological activity. In this study, we have investigated a new series of allylated monocarbonyl analogs of curcumin (MAC) and tested their effect on gastric cancer cells. Our results show six MAC that selectively targeted cancer cell lines to inhibit growth and induce apoptosis. This activity was achieved by generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) by MAC. We selected one effective MAC (CA10) for further investigation and show that CA10 inhibits cell growth by causing G2/M cell cycle arrest and induction of apoptotic death. CA10 induced ROS generation and subsequent activation of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and inhibition of signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) phosphorylation, inhibits cancer cell proliferation. These anti-tumor activities of CA10 were confirmed in gastric cancer xenografts. CA10 induced ROS, activated the ER stress pathway and inhibited STAT3 phosphorylation and gastric xenografts tumor growth in mice. Our studies provide experimental evidence that MAC CA10 effectively targets gastric cancer in preclinical models by enhancing ROS and ROS-mediated signaling.
