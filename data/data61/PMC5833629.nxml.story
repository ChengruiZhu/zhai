Autophagy affects the pathological progression of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD); however, the precise role of autophagy in NAFLD remains unclear. In this study, we want to identify the role of autophagy including reticulophagy and mitophagy in NAFLD pathogenesis. When HepG2 cells were treated with 400 μM oleic acid (OA), increased reticulophagy was induced 8 h after treatment, which correlated with an anti-apoptotic response as shown by the activation of the PI3K/AKT pathway, an increase in BCL-2 expression, and the downregulation of OA-induced lipotoxicity. When treated with OA for 24 h, DRAM expression-dependent mitophagy resulted in increased apoptosis in HepG2 cells. Inhibition of reticulophagy aggravated and increased lipotoxicity-induced apoptosis 8 h after treatment; however, the inhibition of mitophagy decreased hepatocyte apoptosis after 24 h of OA treatment. Results from the analysis of patient liver samples showed that autophagic flux increased in patients with mild or severe NAFL. PI3K/AKT phosphorylation was observed only in samples from patients with low-grade steatosis, whereas DRAM expression was increased in samples from patients with high-grade steatosis. Together, our results demonstrate that reticulophagy and mitophagy are independent, sequential events that influence NAFLD progression, which opens new avenues for investigating new therapeutics in NAFLD.
