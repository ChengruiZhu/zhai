We aimed to determine whether advanced oxidation protein product (AOPP) levels can serve as a marker of oxidative stress in paediatric patients with chronic tonsillitis. Thirty children with chronic tonsillitis and 30 healthy children (control group) were recruited from the Otorhinolaryngology (ORL) and Paediatric Surgery departments, respectively, of Dumlupinar University Hospital. In the patient group, blood samples were collected before tonsillectomy, and tonsil tissue was sampled during the operation. Blood samples were also obtained from the control subjects. AOPP levels in the serum and tonsil tissue were measured by the spectrophotometric method. Serum AOPP levels were significantly higher in the patient group (13.1 ± 3.3 ng/ml) than in the control group (11.6 ± 2.3 ng/ml; P < 0.05). In addition, the mean AOPP level (41.9 ± 13.5 ng/mg protein) in the tonsil tissue in the patient group was significantly higher than the mean serum AOPP levels in the control and patient groups (P < 0.05). AOPP levels are elevated in the tonsil tissue and serum of patients with chronic tonsillitis compared to the serum AOPP levels in healthy controls. AOPPs may represent a novel class of pro-inflammatory molecules that are involved in oxidative stress in chronic tonsillitis. AOPPs may be used as a marker of oxidative stress in paediatric patients with chronic tonsillitis.
