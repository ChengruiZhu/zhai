-thymidine, and after digestion with DNase is Feulgen negative. The DNA of the body is complexed with histone, like the DNA of the chromosomes, as is revealed by an intense alkaline fast green staining. Electron microscope examination of oocytes reveals that one side of the DNA body is in close contact with the nuclear envelope and that the other side possesses an outer shell composed mainly of particles 150 to 250 A in diameter. Between the outer shell and the chromosomes there is a band of low electron opacity, 4000 to 7000 A thick. In the light microscope, this light band together with the outer shell is Feulgen negative and stains violet with azure B; this is confirmation of the presence of RNA. In the oocytes the nucleoli are found inside the DNA body. These nucleoli have a nucleolonema composed mainly of particles 150 to 250 A. The nucleoli are Feulgen negative, alkaline fast green negative, stain violet with azure B, and do not stain with azure B after RNase digestion, thus confirming their RNA content. The presence of the nucleoli inside the DNA body and of a band of RNA between the body and the chromosomes is indicative of a high RNA synthetic activity. Since the DNA of the body is complexed with histone, as in the chromosomes, and the nucleoli are located inside the body, the simplest interpretation of the DNA body is that it represents hundreds of copies of the operons of the nucleolar organizing region or neighboring regions. The situation found in
