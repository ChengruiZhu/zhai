Hirsutism is a common condition, being present in about 5–15% of women. It is characterized by the growth of terminal hair in a pattern typical for men, like as hair growth in upper lip, chin, cheek and lower and upper abdomen. Not infrequently, hirsutism is followed by other signs of hyerandrogenism such as alopecia, acne, and seborrhea. The current study evaluated the association between a self-reported history of hirsutism and oligo-amenorrhea during reproductive age and the presence of several comorbidities in women after menopause. A total of 1057 women were investigated in a cross-sectional study, and information on the age at menarche, menstrual history, complaints about excessive hair growth, and disease development was obtained. Participants from the study were postmenopausal women aged >55 y who attended ac primary care service at least once during the 24-month period. Exclusion criteria included the presence of cognitive impairment and/or communication difficulties. Main outcomes were the presence of comorbidities after menopause. The prevalence of comorbidities was significantly higher in women with a history of hirsutism and/or oligo-amenorrhea [OR = 1.6 (95% CI 1.1–2.4), p = 0.002] or isolated hirsutism [OR 2.0 (95% CI 1.3–3.2), p = 0.004]. The prevalence of stroke, angina or myocardial infarction, cardiac failure, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and osteoarthritis were significantly higher in postmenopausal women who had experienced hirsutism and/or oligomenorrhea (p < 0.03). Limitations of the study came from the absence of a clear differentiation between hirsutism and hypertrichosis. According our results, the presence of hirsutism and oligo-amenorrhea during the female reproductive period may indicate susceptibility to important diseases at old age.
