Inhibitors of DNA binding and cell differentiation (Id) proteins are members of the large family of the helix-loop-helix (HLH) transcription factors, but they lack any DNA-binding motif. During development, the Id proteins play a key role in the regulation of cell-cycle progression and cell differentiation by modulating different cell-cycle regulators both by direct and indirect mechanisms. Several Id-protein interacting partners have been identified thus far, which belong to structurally and functionally unrelated families, including, among others, the class I and II bHLH transcription factors, the retinoblastoma protein and related pocket proteins, the paired-box transcription factors, and the S5a subunit of the 26Â S proteasome. Although the HLH domain of the Id proteins is involved in most of their protein-protein interaction events, additional motifs located in their N-terminal and C-terminal regions are required for the recognition of diverse protein partners. The ability of the Id proteins to interact with structurally different proteins is likely to arise from their conformational flexibility: indeed, these proteins contain intrinsically disordered regions that, in the case of the HLH region, undergo folding upon self- or heteroassociation. Besides their crucial role for cell-fate determination and cell-cycle progression during development, other important cellular events have been related to the Id-protein expression in a number of pathologies. Dysregulated Id-protein expression has been associated with tumor growth, vascularization, invasiveness, metastasis, chemoresistance and stemness, as well as with various developmental defects and diseases. Herein we provide an overview on the structural properties, mode of action, biological function and therapeutic potential of these regulatory proteins.
