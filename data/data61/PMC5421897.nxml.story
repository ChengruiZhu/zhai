Macrophage inhibitory cytokine 1 (MIC-1/GDF15) has been characterized as a candidate biomarker for colorectal cancer (CRC) recently. However, the role of serum MIC-1 in screening patients with early stage CRC and monitoring therapeutic response have not been well-established, particularly in the combination with CEA for the screening and the prejudgment of occurrence with liver metastasis. In this study, we performed a retrospective blinded evaluation of 987 serum samples from 473 individuals with CRC, 25 with adenomatous polyps, and 489 healthy individuals using ELISA or immunoassay. The sensitivity of serum MIC-1 was 43.8% and 38.5% for CRC diagnosis and early diagnosis, respectively, which were independent of and comparatively higher than for CEA (36.6% and 27.3%) at comparable specificity. Serum MIC-1 after surgery were significantly elevated at the time of tumor recurrence, and notable increase were observed in 100% patients with liver metastasis. Besides the TNM classification and differentiation grade, MIC-1 was an independent prognostic factor contributing to overall survival. We conclude that MIC-1 can act as a candidate complementary biomarker for screening early-stage CRC by combination with CEA, and furthermore, for the first time, identify a promising prognostic indicator for monitoring recurrence with liver metastasis, to support strategies towards personalized therapy.
