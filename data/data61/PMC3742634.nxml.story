Numerous experiments have been conducted over the last few years aiming to identify molecular markers that show the diagnostic accuracy of fine-needle aspiration (FNA), particularly in thyroid lesions that are considered indeterminate. Using certain search arguments and previously defined criteria, 37 studies reporting experiments with the BRAF mutation in pre-operative FNA of the thyroid were selected from the electronic databases PUBMED, MEDLINE, SCOPUS and LILACS, in order to gather evidence with regard to the possible contribution of BRAF in the management of thyroid carcinoma. There were no cases positive for BRAF in follicular carcinomas (FTCs), HÃ¼rthle cell carcinomas (HCCs) or medullary thyroid carcinomas (MTCs). Among the 11 cases of anaplastic thyroid carcinomas (ATC), three showed positive results for the BRAF mutation. The number of cases positive for BRAF among the benign lesions was not significant. The average prevalence of BRAF-positive cases in papillary carcinomas (PTC) was 58.6%, while in follicular variants of papillary carcinoma (FVPTC), the average prevalence was 29.6%. For lesions diagnosed as indeterminate or suspicious, the average prevalence of BRAF positivity in PTC was 48.5%. The experiments included in the present study indicated a specificity of almost 100% and a high predominance of the BRAF mutation in PTC, distinguishing the marker in the planning and medical management of papillary carcinoma of the thyroid.
