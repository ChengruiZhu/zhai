The mean age of our study group was 55.68 (50-76), and the control group was 21 (14-30). The groups were gender-matched, including 17 (30%) male and 40 (70%) females in each group, with an average follow-up of 32 months (range 24-54 months). The two-year survivorship for the study group was 82%. The mean time from arthroscopy to joint replacement was 18.4 months (range 3.5-38.5 months). At latest follow-up, survivorship was 6 of 12 (50%) for patients with Tonnis 2 arthritic grade, versus 32 of 45 (71%) for patients graded Tonnis 0 or 1. For patients 50 and over, the score improvement from preoperative to two-year follow-up was 64 to 89 for mHHS, 60 to 88 for NAHS, 67 to 90 for HOS-ADL, and 42 to 77 for HOS-SSS. For patients 30 and younger, the score improvement from preoperative to two-year follow-up was 55 to 84.5 for mHHS, 53 to 80 for NAHS, 58 to 83 for HOS-ADL, and 35 to 62 for HOS-SSS. All improvements in both groups were statistically significant (p<0.05). There were no significant differences seen between the groups in score improvements for mHHS, NAHS or HOS-ADL. However, the improvement in the HOS-SSS was greater in the control group (p=0.03). The post-operative VAS was similar between the groups: 3.1 for the 50 and over group and 2.5 for the 30 and younger group. Satisfaction was 8.27 for the 50 and over group and 8.41 for 30 and younger group, and was also similar between groups.
