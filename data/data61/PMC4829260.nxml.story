Using survey results and spatial scanning techniques, the researchers detected 27 serologically defined malaria hotpots (clusters of people with antibodies to the malaria parasite) in Rachuonyo South District. Of these, ten hotspots were at least 1.5 kilometers from the nearest neighboring hotspot (allowing space for evaluation zones and a buffer between hotspots). During the following peak malaria transmission period, they randomly allocated five of these hotspots to targeted interventions (larvicide treatment of stagnant water, community distribution of insecticide-treated bednets, indoor residual spraying, and mass drug administration) and five hotspots to the control intervention (the Kenyan national policy of annual indoor residual spraying, routine case management at clinics, and bednet distribution at antenatal clinics). Intervention coverage exceeded 87% for all the components of the targeted intervention. However, the intervention did not change the prevalence of parasites (the proportion of the population carrying parasites) at 8 or 16 weeks post-intervention in the evaluation zones—the areas 1–500 meters from the border of the hotspots (the study’s primary outcome). There was a statistically significant reduction in parasite prevalence inside intervention hotspots at 8 but not 16 weeks post-intervention (a statistically significant change is one unlikely to have happened by chance). Finally, similar numbers of individuals from the intervention and control clusters attended local health facilities and were found to have confirmed clinical malaria, and there was no significant difference between intervention and control clusters in the number of mosquitoes caught within hotspots or evaluation zones.
