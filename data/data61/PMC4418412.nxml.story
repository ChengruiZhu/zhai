This study aims to investigate whether attention and spatiotemporal integration deficits are dissociated in patients with bilateral posterior cortical atrophy (PCA), and whether it is their combination that leads to a severe clinical handicap. We recorded performance and ocular behavior of four PCA patients and four age-matched controls in visual search and counting tasks. We measured the percentage of targets detected and the mean detection time in a “pop-out” search. We also compared counting ability when a set of dots is presented briefly (in healthy individuals, the automatic deployment of attention over space allows a fast estimation of quantity) or for unlimited duration (favoring sequential counting, hence spatiotemporal integration). All patients showed reduced deployment of attention over space (simultanagnosia), resulting in increased visual search times and underestimations of the number of briefly presented dots. Only two patients showed ocular revisiting behavior that caused frequent omissions in visual search and overestimations of the number of dots presented for unlimited duration. The impairment to deploy attention is considered here as a bilateral covert attention deficit. Disorganized ocular exploration appears to be independent and is hypothesized to result from processes maintaining a salience map over time (spatial working memory) and especially across saccades.
