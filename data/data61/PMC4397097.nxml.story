Current brain connectome projects are attempting to construct a map of the structural and functional network connections in the brain. One goal of these projects is to understand how network organization determines local functions and information transfer patterns, which is essential to achieve higher cognitive brain functions. Because of the limitation of constructing all brain maps for all cognitive states, finding a general relationship of global topology, local dynamics and the directionality of information transfer in a network is crucial. In this study, we show that inter-node directionality arises naturally from the topology of the network. Analytical, computational, and empirical results all demonstrate that network nodes with more connections (i.e., higher degree) lag in phase, while lower-degree nodes lead. Our mathematical analysis allowed us to predict the directionality patterns in general model networks as well as human brain networks across different states of consciousness. These findings may provide more straightforward approaches to dissecting how directionality between interacting nodes is shaped in complex brain networks, providing a foundation for understanding principles of information transfer. Furthermore, the underlying mathematical relationship between node connections and directionality patterns has the potential to advance network science across numerous disciplines.
