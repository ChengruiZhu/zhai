Among 96 children with orofacial clefts, only 24 children (25%) had symptomatic ear problems, whereas on ear examination, 56 children (58.3%) had abnormal ear findings. Middle ear effusion (MEE) was the most common ear condition, and it was seen in 94 ears (48.9%). Cholesteatoma was noted in six children (3.1%). Out of 73 children in the zero to five age group, 58 children (79.5%) did not have any history of ear problem but 55.5% (81 ears) had features of MEE such as a dull tympanic membrane (TM). In the age group of more than five years to 10 years, only four children (28.5%) were symptomatic. Five children (55.5%) out of nine in the age group of more than 10 years had a symptomatic ear problem of which four children (44.4%) had chronic otitis media squamosal disease. The earlier age groups showed a trend of ear disease being asymptomatic compared to older children. Normal hearing was present in only 40 children (41.7%) and various degrees of hearing loss were seen in 56 children (58.3%). The mean air conduction threshold in the age group zero to five years, more than five years to 10 years, and more than 10 years were 33±8.3 decibels (dB), 25±6.2 dB, and 31.5±14 dB, respectively. Out of 144 ears (72 children) in the asymptomatic group, 67 ears (46.5%) had normal hearing. Seventy-seven ears (53.5%) had some degree of hearing loss. Mean air conduction hearing loss in the asymptomatic group was 29.8±7.3 dB.
