Twenty-nine patients and a total of 53 breasts were operated on during the study period. Patients underwent either liposuction alone (6 breasts - 11.3%), excision alone (37 breasts - 69.8%) or both excision and liposuction (10 breasts - 18.9%). Twelve operated breasts (22.6%) experienced some form of complication. Minor complications included seroma (2 patients), superficial wound dehiscence (2 patients) and minor bleeding not requiring theatre (3 patients). Two patients developed haematomas requiring evacuation in theatre. No cases of wound infection, major wound dehiscence or revision surgery were encountered. Twenty-six patients (89.7%) returned the patient satisfaction questionnaire. Patients scored an average 4.12 with regards comfort of their chest in different settings, 3.98 with regards chest appearance in different settings, and 4.22 with regards satisfaction levels for themselves and their partner/family. Overall complication rate was 22.6%. Grade III patients experienced the highest complication rate (35.7%), followed by grade II (22.7%) and grade I (17.6%). Overall complication rates among the excision only group was the highest (29.8%) followed by the liposuction only group (16.7%) and the liposuction and excision group (10.0%). There were high satisfaction rates amongst both patients and surgeon. Eleven patients (37.9%) had their outcome classified as ‘excellent’ by the operating surgeon, 16 patients (55.2%) as ‘good’, 1 (3.4%) as ‘satisfactory’ and 1(3.4%) as ‘poor’.
