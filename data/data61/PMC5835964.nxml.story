Dual-specificity phosphatase-2 (DUSP2), a negative regulator of extracellular-regulated kinase activity, has been identified as an important kinase with emerging roles in cancer. However, the clinical significance of DUSP2 in colorectal cancer (CRC) remains to be fully elucidated. In the present study, the expression of DUSP2 was investigated using immunohistochemistry in 96 patients with CRC. Cell viability was estimated using a cell counting kit-8 assay, and cell apoptosis by flow cytometry. The relationship between DUSP2 expression and patient characteristics, including overall survival, were studied retrospectively in these patients. It was found that DUSP2 was differentially expressed between left-sided colon carcinoma (LSCC) and right-sided colon carcinoma (RSCC). It was also found that decreased expression of DUSP2 was correlated with significantly shorter overall survival (P=0.001) and short distant-metastasis-free survival (P=0.002). In univariate comparisons, the decreased expression of DUSP2 was found to be an independent risk factor for poor survival rate (HR 3.55, CI 1.092â€“9.896; P=0.002). It was also found that the enforced overexpression of DUSP2 sensitized CRC cells to cetuximab. In conclusion, the findings demonstrated that DUSP2 was differentially expressed between RSCC and LSCC, and that the overexpression of DUSP2 increased the inhibitory effect of cetuximab in CRC, suggesting that DUSP2 may be a novel biomarker and therapeutic target in CRC therapy.
