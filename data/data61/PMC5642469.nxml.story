Although pre-B acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is the most common type of renal leukemic infiltration; the renal infiltration with leukemia cells as the initial manifestation of leukemia is very rare. Translocation (1;19)(q23;p13) is one of the most common chromosomal abnormalities in patients with ALL and is observed in 5 – 6% of children with pre-B ALL. However, the incidence of t(1;19) in adults is lower, not exceeding 3%, and the prognosis of adult patients is usually poor. Herein, we report a 52-year-old female patient with pre-B ALL who initially presented as bilateral renal enlargement. The cytogenetic analysis revealed chromosomal abnormalities including t(1;19). The patient underwent three consecutive courses of chemotherapy with VDLP (vincristine, daunorubicin, L-asp, and prednisolone) and gained a short complete remission. Her kidneys recovered to normal size, and renal function returned to normal level. However, after complete remission for only 3 months, the patient exhibited resistance to consolidation chemotherapy and indicated evidence of marrow relapse. Although we increased the drug dosage and attempted to use a different protocol, she died of severe anemia and hemorrhage almost 10 months after she was first admitted. In conclusion, pre-B cell ALL is the most common type of leukemia to present with renal infiltration as the presenting sign. Because of the poor outcome of ALL, some new therapeutic approaches may improve the patients’ conditions.
