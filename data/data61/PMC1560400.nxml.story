One of the primary goals for geneticists is isolating regions of the genome that convey increased risk of disease through the association of genetic polymorphisms with phenotypic traits. The recent availability of genome-wide polymorphism data (i.e., single nucleotide polymorphisms [SNPs]) has made association studies possible on an unprecedented scale, and the characterization and selection of these polymorphisms for these studies has been a topic of major interest. One method for choosing informative SNPs has been to compare the correlation between SNPs (a term called linkage disequilibrium), but this can create confounding problems when comparing SNPs of different frequencies. In this study, the authors show that if SNPs are compared to other SNPs of equal or near equal frequency, the correlation between them more accurately represents the true correlation. This also produces a more sensitive method for determining linkage disequilibrium. Using this method, SNPs were compared both within and outside of gene regions to examine the overall correlation between SNPs in each region. Matching SNPs according to their frequency greatly increased the maximum possible correlation and showed significantly higher correlations between SNPs within genes (intragenic) versus between genes (intergenic). Using the recently completed chimpanzee sequence, a larger fraction of high frequency human specific SNPs was found within the perfectly correlated SNP pairs in genic regions compared to intergenic regions. These observations suggest that regions of the genome around genes have been under selective pressure, leading to a greater correlation between SNPs. Genes found in regions with the highest correlations between SNPs will be of particular interest for future genotype-phenotype association studies.
