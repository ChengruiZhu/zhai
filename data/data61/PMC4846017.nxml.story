The researchers first defined ITA.LI.CA stages for HCC using tumor characteristics only. They then used information on 3,628 patients in the ITA.LI.CA database (the “training” set) and statistical modeling to calculate the relative prognostic value of tumor staging, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status (an indicator of whether patients are able to look after themselves and undertake normal daily activities), liver function (measured using the Child—Pugh score), and alpha-fetoprotein level (a liver tumor marker) in the prediction of the survival of individual patients. Based on these modeling results, they constructed an ITA.LI.CA integrated prognostic score. The researchers report that the observed and predicted median (average) survival times in the training set and in an internal validation cohort of 1,555 additional patients in the ITA.LI.CA database were similar. Moreover, although the observed and predicted survival times were lower in the Italian patients than in 2,651 patients with HCC from Taiwan, the ITA.LI.CA score had high discrimination and calibration features in this external validation cohort as well (the discrimination of a prognostic model indicates its ability to separate patients into groups with different outcomes, the calibration of a prognostic model is the degree of correspondence between predicted and observed outcomes). Finally, the prognostic ability of the new ITA.LI.CA prognostic model was significantly better than that of several other prognostic scoring systems.
