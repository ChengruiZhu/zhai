Purpose: To validate the utility and effectiveness of a standardized tool for
prioritization of information sources for early detection of diseases. Methods:
The tool was developed with input from diverse public health experts garnered
through survey. Ten raters used the tool to evaluate ten information sources and
reliability among raters was computed. The Proc mixed procedure with random
effect statement and SAS Macros were used to compute multiple ratersâ€™
Fleiss Kappa agreement and Kendall's Coefficient of Concordance. Results:
Ten disparate information sources evaluated obtained the following composite
scores: ProMed 91%; WAHID 90%; Eurosurv 87%; MediSys 85%; SciDaily 84%; EurekAl
83%; CSHB 78%; GermTrax 75%; Google 74%; and CBC 70%. A Fleiss Kappa agreement
of 50.7% was obtained for ten information sources and 72.5% for a sub-set of
five sources rated, which is substantial agreement validating the utility and
effectiveness of the tool. Conclusion: This study validated the utility and
effectiveness of a standardized criteria tool developed to prioritize
information sources. The new tool was used to identify five information sources
suited for use by the KIWI system in the CEZD-IIR project to improve
surveillance of infectious diseases. The tool can be generalized to situations
when prioritization of numerous information sources is necessary.
