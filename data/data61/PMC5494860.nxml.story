The multi-step progression of colorectal cancer through precancerous lesions (adenoma and dysplasia) is associated with cumulative molecular alterations, a number of which have also been demonstrated to be present in morphologically normal transitional mucosa adjacent to colorectal cancer. The cytoskeletal protein cytokeratin 7 (CK7) and the receptor tyrosine kinase, KIT proto-oncogene receptor tyrosine kinase (CD117), encoded by the proto-oncogene c-Kit, are lacking in normal colorectal crypt epithelium and are aberrantly expressed in a subset of colorectal cancer. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the expression of CK7 and CD117 in morphologically normal transitional mucosa adjacent to colorectal cancer. Immunohistochemical staining for CK7 and CD117 was performed in the mucosa adjacent to five groups of surgically resected colorectal tumors [low-grade adenoma, high-grade adenoma, mucosal adenocarcinoma, small-sized invasive adenocarcinoma (â‰¤2 cm) and large-sized invasive adenocarcinoma (>2 cm)]. CK7 was expressed in the mucosa adjacent to a subset of colorectal tumors, and the positivity ratio increased according to tumor grade from low-grade adenoma up to small-sized invasive adenocarcinoma (61.2%). However, the positivity ratio of CK7 in the mucosa adjacent to the large-sized invasive adenocarcinoma (25.0%) was significantly lower compared with that of the next lower grade. CD117 was also expressed in the mucosa adjacent to a subset of colorectal tumors. In contrast to CK7, the positivity ratio of CD117 increased according to tumor grade from low-grade adenoma all the way through to the large-sized invasive adenocarcinoma (45.0%). Based on these results, the mechanism of CK7 and CD117 expression in the transitional mucosa adjacent to colorectal cancer may be different, and analysis of their individual expression may provide novel insights into the development and progression of colorectal cancer.
