38 patients (47% male, mean age 67.5 years) and 32 healthcare professionals provided 70 interviews. Both patients and professionals considered that home tele-monitoring had the potential to reduce the risk of hospital admission. Patients generally appreciated being ‘watched over’ by the tele-monitoring, which gave them confidence to manage their own condition. They used tele-data to improving their understanding of COPD, determine their current state of health and influence decisions about their daily activities. Numerical data (e.g. oxygen saturations) were particularly valued. Changes in readings validated their decisions to adjust treatment or seek timely professional advice, and eased access to clinical care. Patients valued the personalised care provided by tele-monitoring staff familiar with their circumstances and state of health. Professionals emphasised the potential role of telemetry in encouraging prompt compliance with medically defined behaviours and attitudes, though some doubted whether it would be sufficient to overcome a perceived reluctance on the part of patients to acknowledge and take ownership of the disease. There was also a concern that ‘fixation’ on monitoring physiological parameters (especially oxygen saturation levels), promoted a medical model of the disease and might increase dependence on services in some patients. The GPs and community nursing or physiotherapy teams who provided the supporting services emphasised the importance of ‘knowing the patient’ and ‘knowing what’s normal for the individual’ in using their clinical skills to interpret incoming tele-monitoring data.
