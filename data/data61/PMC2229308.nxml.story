Intact frog skeletal muscle fibers were injected with the Ca2+ indicator fura-2 conjugated to high molecular weight dextran (fura dextran, MW approximately 10,000; dissociation constant for Ca2+, 0.52 microM), and the fluorescence was measured from cytoplasm (17 degrees C). The fluorescence excitation spectrum of fura dextran measured in resting fibers was slightly red-shifted compared with the spectrum of the Ca(2+)-free indicator in buffer solutions. A simple comparison of the spectra in the cytoplasm and the in vitro solutions indicates an apparently "negative" cytoplasmic [Ca2+], which probably reflects an alteration of the indicator properties in the cytoplasm. To calibrate the indicator's fluorescence signal in terms of cytoplasmic [Ca2+], we applied beta-escin to permeabilize the cell membrane of the fibers injected with fura dextran. After treatment with 5 microM beta-escin for 30-35 min, the cell membrane was permeable to small molecules (e.g., Ca2+, ATP), whereas the 10-kD fura dextran only slowly leaked out of the fiber. It was thus possible to estimate calibration parameters in the indicator fluorescence in the fibers by changing the bathing solution [Ca2+] to various levels; the average values for the fraction of Ca(2+)-bound indicator in the resting fibers and the dissociation constant for Ca2+ (KD) were, respectively, 0.052 and 1.0 microM. For the comparison, the KD value was also estimated by a kinetic analysis of the indicator fluorescence change after an action potential stimulation in intact muscle fibers, and the average value was 2.5 microM. From these values estimated in the fibers, resting cytoplasmic [Ca2+] in frog skeletal muscle fibers was calculated to be 0.06-0.14 microM. The range lies between the high estimates from other tetracarboxylate indicators (0.1-0.3 microM; Kurebayashi, N., A. B. Harkins, and S. M. Baylor. 1993. Biophysical Journal. 64:1934-1960; Harkins, A. B., N. Kurebayashi, and S. M. Baylor. 1993. Biophysical Journal. 65:865-881) and the low estimate from the simultaneous use of aequorin and Ca(2+)-sensitive microelectrodes (< 0.04-0.06 microM; Blatter, L. A., and J. R. Blinks. 1991. Journal of General Physiology. 98:1141-1160) recently reported for resting cytoplasmic [Ca2+] in frog muscle fibers.
