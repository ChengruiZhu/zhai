Human cells exploit different mechanisms to coordinate the expression of both protein-coding and non-coding RNAs. Elucidating these mechanisms is essential to understanding normal physiology and disease. In our attempt to identify new regulatory layers acting particularly at proximal promoters, we have computationally analyzed the genomic sequences located from −150 bp to +50 bp relative to the transcriptional start site (TSS), which are often at the center of ‘open’ chromatin regions in human promoters. We have confirmed the presence of a series of cis-regulatory elements (here referred to as ‘cardinal’ motifs) that show a strong preference for these short regions. Interestingly, these elements tend to act independently rather than in fixed combinations. Therefore, we propose that they confer unique regulatory features to the human promoter subsets that contain each of these particular elements. In agreement with this model, we have identified a large repertoire of preferential partnerships between transcription factors recognizing cardinal motifs and their associated proteins (cofactors), thus decoding a signature-based model that distinguishes distinctive regulatory types of promoters based on cardinal motifs. These signatures may underlie a new layer of transcriptional regulation to orchestrate coordinated gene expression in human promoters.
