The link between chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection and a subset of B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphomas (B-NHL) is strongly supported by epidemiological studies. Evidence demonstrating complete regression of lymphoma after antiviral treatments suggests possible chronic antigenic stimulation for the origin of B-NHL and provides evidence for a virus-mediated lymphomagenesis. B-NHL is a heterogeneous group of lymphomas with varied clinical presentation and may be indolent or aggressive. The optimal management of HCV related B-NHL is not clear. Antiviral treatment may be sufficient for low-grade lymphomas, but chemotherapy is necessary in patients with high grade lymphomas. Interferon (IFN)-based antiviral treatment regimens for HCV infection are limited by poor tolerance and suboptimal antiviral response. Recently approved novel direct acting antiviral (DAA) drugs are highly effective and safe. This has opened a new era for the treatment of HCV related B-NHL alone or in conjunction with chemotherapy. Treatment of HCV associated B-NHL should be performed in an interdisciplinary approach in close consultation with hematologist and hepatologist. In this review, we summarize data regarding clinical features and epidemiology of B-NHL and discuss novel therapeutic approaches, including DAAs, that may prove to be effective in the treatment of HCV associated lymphomas.
