The aim of this work was to determine the relationship between peak twitch amplitude and sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) Ca2+ content during changes of stimulation frequency in isolated canine ventricle, and to estimate the extent to which these changes were dependent upon sarcolemmal Na(+)-Ca2+ exchange. In physiological [Na+]o, increased stimulation frequency in the 0.2-2-Hz range resulted in a positive inotropic effect characterized by an increase in peak twitch amplitude and a decrease in the duration of contraction, measured as changes in isometric force development or unloaded cell shortening in intact muscle and isolated single cells, respectively. Action potentials recorded from single cells indicated that the inotropic effect was associated with a progressive decrease of action potential duration and a marked reduction in average time spent by the cell near the resting potential during the stimulus train. The frequency-dependent increase of peak twitch force was correlated with an increase of Ca2+ uptake into and release from the SR. This was estimated indirectly using the phasic contractile response to rapid (less than 1 s) lowering of perfusate temperature from 37 degrees C to 0-2 degrees C and changes of twitch amplitude resulting from perturbations in the pattern of electrical stimulation. Lowering [Na+]o from 140 to 70 mM resulted in an increase of contractile strength, which was accompanied by a similar increase of apparent SR Ca2+ content, both of which could be abolished by exposure to ryanodine (1 x 10(-8) M), caffeine (3 x 10(-3) M), or nifedipine (2 x 10(-6) M). Increased stimulation frequency in 70 mM [Na+]o resulted in a negative contractile staircase, characterized by a graded decrease of peak isometric force development or unloaded cell shortening. SR Ca2+ content estimated under identical conditions remained unaltered. Rate constants derived from mechanical restitution studies implied that the depressant effect of increased stimulation frequency in 70 mM [Na+]o was not a consequence of a decreased rate of refilling of a releasable pool of Ca2+ within the cell. These results demonstrate that frequency-dependent changes of contractile strength and intracellular Ca2+ loading in 140 mM [Na+]o require the presence of a functional sarcolemmal Na(+)-Ca2+ exchange process. The possibility that the negative staircase in 70 mM [Na+]o is related to inhibition of Ca(2+)-induced release of Ca2+ from the SR by various cellular mechanisms is discussed.
