Abdominoplasty is listed among five most common esthetic surgical procedures in the Western World. Despite all efforts, abdominoplasty bears a high risk of complications. We observed a 39-year-old-woman with previous classical abdominoplasty performed elsewhere three years ago. Clinical examination demonstrated a swollen and tense abdominal mass. Laboratory findings were normal. Clinical examination was completed by abdominal ultrasonography which demonstrated both, a significant fluid volume in this area and a dense fibrous “capsule”. The diagnosis was a late or chronic encapsulated seroma with a thick pseudocapsule or “bursa”. We performed a revision abdominoplasty with a standard supra-fascial dissection. Surgical resection of infra-umbilical flap containing skin, subcutaneous tissue and capsulectomy were performed under general anaesthesia. A new umbilicus was created attaching small skin flaps in the muscular fascia. No drains were used. We observed no seroma formation. Follow up after six and ten months was unremarkable. The fibrous pseudocapsule of chronic seroma results in different degrees of deformities, abdominal scar deviation and asymmetry. Surgical capsulectomy combined with revision abdominoplasty with preservation of Scarpa’s fascia and placement of progressive tension sutures resulted in being effective and leads an esthetic outcome without seroma recurrence.
