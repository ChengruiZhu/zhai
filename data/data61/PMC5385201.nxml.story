Necitumumab is a second-generation, recombinant, human immunoglobulin G1, epidermal growth factor (EGFR) receptor antibody that specifically blocks the ligand binding site of EGFR. Necitumumab potentially acts by blocking ligand epidermal growth factor (EGF) binding-mediated activation of the EGFR signaling pathway, inhibiting tumor growth, angiogenesis, and anti-apoptotic mechanisms. Necitumumab inhibited the interaction of EGF and EGFR with a concentration that inhibits binding by 50 % of approximately 0.9 nM (0.13 mg/L) and demonstrated antitumor activity during in vivo experiments associated with trough plasma concentrations of approximately 40 mg/L. This work describes the population pharmacokinetics of necitumumab in cancer patients when administered with or without concomitant chemotherapy and evaluates patient characteristics that may guide dosing. Nonlinear mixed-effects modeling of serum concentration data across five clinical studies (phases I–III) indicated that necitumumab exhibited target-mediated drug disposition, commonly observed with monoclonal antibodies, and that pharmacokinetics were expected to be linear in the studied dose ranges when administered as repeated infusions. No age, sex, race, or concomitant medication factors were found influential, while weight was a statistically significant factor for both distribution and elimination. Simulations from the final model indicated that only a limited reduction in patient drug exposure variability would be achieved by weight- or body surface area-based dosing. Necitumumab effective half-life was estimated to approximately 2 weeks, and steady state was achieved within three to four cycles of treatment. The phase III dosing schedule of 800 mg dosed on days 1 and 8 of a 21-day schedule resulted in serum concentrations that exceeded the 40-mg/L threshold indicated by preclinical experiments.
