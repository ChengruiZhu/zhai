Understanding the interplay between the extracellular environment and intracellular decision circuitry of a cell is important but is an arduous goal to achieve since many interacting factors, difficult to measure and control in experiment, are involved. The authors address this problem by means of computational modeling using the example of a bacterial population that cooperatively switches on a common gene expression program if a certain critical population density is achieved. They developed a detailed model of the intracellular control network and demonstrated that it can operate as an “on–off” gene expression switch that is sensitive to environmental control and yet highly robust to intracellular molecular noise. The population-wide transition is further modeled using a novel method in which each bacterium is given a unique copy of an intracellular network. This approach, which allows monitoring of both the dynamics of individual cells and population behavior, provides an explanation for the gradual appearance of the transition to the “on” state that has been observed in experiments, and quantitatively predicts the critical value of the population density at which this transition occurs. Unexpectedly, a comparison of the cell densities required for the transition in different environmental conditions brought about a hypothesis regarding the previously elusive ecological and evolutionary function of this cooperative phenomenon.
