 liver transplantation. Arm 1: prolonged‐release tacrolimus (initial dose 0.2mg/kg/day); Arm 2: prolonged‐release tacrolimus (0.15–0.175mg/kg/day) plus basiliximab; Arm 3: prolonged‐release tacrolimus (0.2mg/kg/day delayed until Day 5) plus basiliximab. All patients received MMF plus a bolus of corticosteroid (no maintenance steroids). Primary endpoint: eGFR (MDRD4) at Week 24. Secondary endpoints: composite efficacy failure, BCAR and AEs. Baseline characteristics were comparable. Tacrolimus trough levels were readily achieved posttransplant; initially lower in Arm 2 versus 1 with delayed initiation in Arm 3. eGFR (MDRD4) was higher in Arms 2 and 3 versus 1 (p = 0.001, p = 0.047). Kaplan–Meier estimates of composite efficacy failure‐free survival were 72.0%, 77.6%, 73.9% in Arms 1–3. BCAR incidence was significantly lower in Arm 2 versus 1 and 3 (p = 0.016, p = 0.039). AEs were comparable. Prolonged‐release tacrolimus (0.15–0.175mg/kg/day) immediately posttransplant plus basiliximab and MMF (without maintenance corticosteroids) was associated with lower tacrolimus exposure, and significantly reduced renal function impairment and BCAR incidence versus prolonged‐release tacrolimus (0.2mg/kg/day) administered immediately posttransplant. Delayed higher‐dose prolonged‐release tacrolimus initiation significantly reduced renal function impairment compared with immediate posttransplant administration, but BCAR incidence was comparable.
