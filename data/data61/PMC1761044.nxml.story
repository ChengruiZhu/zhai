Cells in the human body interpret extracellular information to “decide” on the execution of particular behaviors such as migration, proliferation, and differentiation. Many diseases, such as cancer, occur when these decision-making processes are compromised. The transfer of extracellular information to the intracellular space is often accomplished through receptor proteins whose chemical properties are altered as extracellular conditions change. These receptors transfer information in the intracellular space through the transfer of phosphate groups from one molecule to another. In particular, the transfer of phosphate groups to tyrosine sites is critical for cellular signaling. How the cell decides to execute a particular behavior on the basis of many changing phosphorylation events, however, is not understood. Here, we apply a computational approach to understand and predict how cells make the decision to migrate and proliferate as extracellular information changes. In particular, we wanted to understand the basis of decision-making processes in cells overexpressing a receptor protein called human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2). This receptor is overexpressed in ∼30% of breast cancer patients and correlates with poor prognosis. Taking advantage of a recently published dataset that quantified tyrosine phosphorylation events in HER2-overexpressing cells, we created models to understand and to predict HER2-mediated changes in migration and proliferation. The model identified small subsets of measured phosphorylation events that are predictive of changes in behavior with HER2 overexpression. Analysis of the phosphorylated subset of proteins implicated certain cellular processes as being crucial for cellular decision making, and suggested potential biomarkers and targets for therapeutic use in HER2-overexpressing cancers. Further application of our technique should aid in the understanding of cellular decision processes from large sets of cell signal and behavior data.
