, however, the considerable diversity and complexity of the vast array of chemical compounds have made their precise identification and quantification challenging. As such, only a relatively small subset of olive-derived compounds has been explored for their biological activity and potential health effects to date. Although there is adequate information describing the identification or isolation of olive-derived compounds, these are not easily searchable, especially when attempting to acquire chemical or biological properties. Therefore, we have created the OliveNet™ database containing a comprehensive catalogue of compounds identified from matrices of the olive, including the fruit, leaf and VOO, as well as in the wastewater and pomace accrued during oil production. From a total of 752 compounds, chemical analysis was sufficient for 676 individual compounds, which have been included in the database. The database is curated and comprehensively referenced containing information for the 676 compounds, which are divided into 13 main classes and 47 subclasses. Importantly, with respect to current research trends, the database includes 222 olive phenolics, which are divided into 13 subclasses. To our knowledge, OliveNet™ is currently the only curated open access database with a comprehensive collection of compounds associated with
