Complex organisms develop following a genetic program specifying how their cells differentiate into organs with different specialized functions. Details of these mechanisms are incomplete, and aspects might not be correct. These genetic programs can be represented by simple computer programs processing input data into outputs, as a way of finding out more about cell differentiation. Our strategy has entailed generating and analyzing many programs whose outcomes do not conflict with our current biological knowledge for any of the documented combinations of inputs. Initial brute-force construction and evaluation of smaller networks was not entirely successful. We go on to present arithmetic arguments which show that it is computationally unfeasible for larger networks to check all possible programs for complying with biological knowledge. Hence, we have employed an approach inspired by biological evolution, namely genetic programming, with refinements to favor the most likely and not overly complex programs. Our test case is the program used by plants to produce flowers (a prerequisite for fruits and seeds), which is commercially very important. Our technique showed that the spatial distribution of cells was crucial and most of the presumed mechanism occurred in all programs, and was able both to point out probable gaps in our biological knowledge and to suggest suitable additions. Furthermore, this approach can be applied to other biological developmental programs.
