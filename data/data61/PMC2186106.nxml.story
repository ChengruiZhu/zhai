The above observations demonstrated induction of immunological tolerance in vitro in primed IgD-, IgG+ B cells. In these studies, addition of trinitrophenylated (TNP) turkey gammaglobulin (TGG) or TNP ovalbumin conjugates suppressed the secondary in vitro response in mice primed with TNP keyhole limpet hemocyanin (TNP-KLH). Suppression was not a reflection of a shift in kinetics of the antibody response, was not dependent on suppressor T cells, and could only be eliciate when conjugate was added within 4 h of addition of TNP-KLH moreover, preincubation of the primed spleen cells with TNP-TGG for 20 h at 37 degrees C, followed by extensive washing, was as effective in inhibiting the response to TNP-KLH as when TNP-TGG was present throughout the 5 d of culture, reflecting induction of a tolerant state. Amounts of conjugate in the concentration range that have been shown by others to tolerize immature or neonatal B cells or mature B cells that have been stripped of surface IgD were sufficient to induce tolerance. The target cells being tolerized did not bear IgD, as determined by B cell depletion and blocking procedures with anti IgD. Whether the lack of surface IgD on the primed cells contributed to the relative ease of tolerance induction was not established by these studies, but the advantages of using primed B cells to examine further the role of surface IgD in tolerance susceptibility was discussed.
