Chloride channels are present in the majority of epithelial cells, where they mediate absorption or secretion of NaCl. Although the absorptive and secretory channels are well characterized in terms of their electrophysiological behavior, there is a lack of pharmacological ligands that can aid us in further functional and eventually molecular characterization. To obtain such ligands, we prepared membrane vesicles from bovine kidney cortex and apical membrane vesicles from trachea and found that they contain a chloride transport process that is electrically conductive. This conductance was reduced by preincubating the vesicles in media containing ATP or ATP-gamma-S, but not beta- methylene ATP, which suggests that the membranes contain a kinase that can close the channels. We then screened compounds derived from three classes: indanyloxyacetic acid (IAA), anthranilic acid (AA), and ethacrynic acid. We identified potent inhibitors from the IAA and the AA series. We tritiated IAA-94 and measured binding of this ligand to the kidney cortex membrane vesicles and found a high-affinity binding site whose dissociation constant (0.6 microM) was similar to the inhibition constant (1 microM). There was a good correlation between the inhibitory potency of several IAA derivatives and their efficacy in displacing [3H]IAA-94 from its binding site. Further, other chloride channel inhibitors, including AA derivatives, ethacrynic acid, bumetanide, and DIDS, also displaced the ligand from its binding site. A similar conductance was found in apical membrane vesicles from bovine trachea that was also inhibited by IAA-94 and AA-130B, but the inhibitory effects of these compounds were weaker than their effects on the renal cortex channel. The two drugs were also less potent in displacing [3H]IAA-94 from the tracheal binding site.
