The biological characteristics and roles of insulin-like growth factor II mRNA-binding protein 3 protein (IMP3) expression in small-intestinal adenocarcinoma were investigated. The value of IMP3 immunostaining in the diagnosis of small-intestinal epithelial lesions was also evaluated. Immunohistochemical expression of IMP3 in normal small-intestinal mucosa adjacent to adenoma and adenocarcinoma lesions, and inflamed duodenal and ileal mucosa was analyzed. Samples assessed were: duodenal ulcer (n=6), Crohnâ€™s disease (n=5), low-grade small-intestinal adenoma (n=10), high-grade small-intestinal adenoma (n=13), small-intestinal adenocarcinoma (n=23), lymph node metastases (LNM; n=7), and preoperative biopsies of small-intestinal adenocarcinoma (n=6). Immunohistochemical expression of Ki-67 and p53 was also analyzed in adenoma and adenocarcinoma samples. IMP3 was not expressed in normal epithelium, but weakly expressed in reparative epithelium. Meanwhile, increased IMP3 expression was associated with a higher degree of dysplasia in adenomas, higher T classification, LNM, Ki-67 positivity, histological differentiation, and lower 5-year disease-free survival, but not p53 expression in adenocarcinoma. IMP3 expression appears to be a late event in the small-intestinal carcinogenesis. Assessing the IMP3 staining pattern can be useful in the diagnosis of small-intestinal epithelial lesions when used in conjunction with other histological criteria.
