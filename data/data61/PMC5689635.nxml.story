Neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio (NLR), derived neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio (dNLR), platelet to lymphocyte ratio (PLR) and lymphocyte to monocyte ratio (LMR) were promising biomarkers used to predict diagnosis and prognosis in various inflammatory responses diseases and cancers. However, there have been no reports regarding these biomarkers in kidney stone patients. This study aimed to evaluate the predictive value of inflammatory biomarkers for metabolic syndrome (MetS) and post-PCNL SIRS in nephrolithiasis patients. We retrospectively enrolled 513 patients with nephrolithiasis and 204 healthy controls. NLR, dNLR, LMR and PLR in nephrolithiasis patients were significantly higher than control group. Patients with renal stone have higher NLR, dNLR, LMR and PLR than those without. ROC curve analysis indicated NLR, dNLR, LMR and PLR for predicting patients with nephrolithiasis and MetS, displayed AUC of 0.730, 0.717, 0.627 and 0.606. Additionally, ROC curves, using post-PCNL SIRS as the end-point for NLR, dNLR, LMR and PLR with AUC of 0.831, 0.813, 0.723 and 0.685. Multivariate analysis revealed that NLR, dNLR represented independent factors for predicting post-PCNL SIRS. While LMR independently associated with MetS. These resluts demonstrate preoperative NLR, dNLR and LMR appears to be effective predictors of post-PCNL SIRS and LMR of MetS in nephrolithiasis patients.
