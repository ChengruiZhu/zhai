Hox proteins are key transcriptional regulators of animal development, famously helping to determine identity along the anterior-posterior body axis. Although their evolution and developmental roles are well established, the molecular mechanisms underlying their specific functions remain poorly characterized. The current dominant view is that interaction with different members of the PBC family of transcription factors confers specific DNA-binding properties on different Hox proteins. However, this idea conflicts with in vitro evidence that a short “hexapeptide” (HX) motif shared by most Hox proteins is solely responsible for generic PBC recruitment. Here we have used the BiFC (bimolecular fluorescence complementation) method to address the global importance of the HX motif for Hox-PBC interactions in living cells and living animals including fruit flies and chick embryos. We observe that most interactions between Hox and PBC proteins do not depend on HX, and that alternative protein motifs are widely used for PBC recruitment in vivo. We also show that DNA binding by a second family of cofactors, the Meis proteins, unmasks these alternative interaction modes and that this property is conserved not only across Bilateria, but also in the basal animal phylum Cnidaria. Taken together, our results demonstrate that Hox-PBC partnership relies on multiple interaction modes, which can be influenced by additional transcriptional partners. We propose that this ancestral feature has been essential for ensuring Hox functional plasticity during development and evolution.
