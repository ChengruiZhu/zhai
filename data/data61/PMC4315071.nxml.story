The aim of the present study was to investigate the effect of the combination of interventional adenovirus-p53 (Ad-p53) introduction and ultrasonic irradiation (CIAIUI) treatment for liver cancer, including evaluating the Ad-p53 transfection efficiency and the impact of the p53 gene on vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and matrix metalloprotein 2 (MMP2) protein expression levels. Ad-p53 was arterially infused into the hepatic carcinoma via the interventional introduction of the hepatic tumor-bearing artery (IIHTBA) or the CIAIUI. Serum VEGF levels were determined by performing an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay; immunohistochemical analysis was used to identify the expression levels of intratumoral p53, MMP2 and VEGF; and western blot analysis was used to determine the impact of different Ad-p53 administration methods on the expression of wild-type p53. The wild-type p53 expression level was significantly higher in the p53-treated group compared with the control group, and the p53 expression level in the CIAIUI group was significantly higher compared with the non-irradiation group. The CIAIUI could significantly reduce the serum VEGF levels. The two delivery methods caused a reduction in the intratumoral VEGF and MMP2 expression levels, and the effects of CIAIUI were most obvious. Ad-p53 infusion via IIHTBA promoted the protein expression levels of p53, however, it inhibited the protein expression levels of MMP2 and VEGF, indirectly indicating that the gene may inhibit the growth of liver cancer. Therefore, CIAIUI therapy exhibited an overall improved therapeutic effect compared with the more simple IIHTBA therapy.
