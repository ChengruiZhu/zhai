Limited data are available about how physicians diagnose and treat influenza. We conducted an internet‐based survey of primary care and emergency physicians to evaluate the use of influenza testing and antiviral medications for diagnosis and treatment of influenza. In April 2005, an electronic link to a 33‐question, web‐based survey was emailed to members of the American College of Physicians, American Academy of Pediatrics, American Academy of Family Physicians, and American College of Emergency Physicians. Of the 157 674 physician members of the four medical societies, 2649 surveys were completed (1·7%). The majority of participants were internists (59%). Sixty percent of respondents reported using rapid tests to diagnose influenza. Factors associated with using rapid influenza tests included physician specialty, type of patient insurance, and practice setting. After controlling for insurance and community setting, emergency physicians and pediatricians were more likely to use rapid influenza tests than internists [odds ratio (OR) 3·7, confidence interval (CI): 2·3–6·1; and OR 1·7, CI: 1·4–2·1, respectively]. Eighty‐six percent of respondents reported prescribing influenza antiviral medications. Reasons for not prescribing antivirals included: patients do not usually present for clinical care within 48 hours of symptom onset (53·0%), cost of antivirals (42·6%) and skepticism about antiviral drug effectiveness (21·7%). The use of rapid tests and antiviral medications for influenza varied by medical specialty. Educating physicians about the utility and limitations of rapid influenza tests and antivirals, and educating patients about seeking prompt medical care for influenza‐like illness during influenza season could lead to more rapid diagnosis and improved management of influenza.
