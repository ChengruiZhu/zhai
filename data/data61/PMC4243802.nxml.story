The optimal sequence of systemic chemotherapy in metastatic breast cancer (MBC) is unknown. We report the case of a woman who was successfully treated with nanoparticle albumin-bound (nab)-paclitaxel for triple negative MBC in our institution. In November 2008, a 48-year-old woman underwent surgical treatment for a triple negative invasive ductal breast cancer and subsequently received adjuvant chemotherapy with fluorouracil/epirubicin/cyclophosphamide and radiotherapy. Sixteen months after surgery, she presented with a left chest wall metastatasis. The patient received combination therapy with conventional paclitaxel (90mg/m² weekly for 3 out of 4 weeks [QW 3/4]) and bevacizumab (10mg/kg every 2 weeks [Q2W]) as first-line treatment for MBC (six cycles; March to September 2010) and achieved a partial response at the metastatic site. Bevacizumab monotherapy was continued until disease progression (April 2011) with the development of a single infraclavicular lymph node metastasis and an increase in the dimensions of the left chest wall lesion. From May to December 2011, the patient received nab-paclitaxel 260mg/m² every 3 weeks (Q3W) as second-line treatment (11 cycles). After three cycles, the left chest wall lesion and the infraclavicular lymph node metastasis were undetectable and the patient was considered to have achieved a complete response. Treatment was well tolerated with no significant toxicity or need for dose reduction. Given our case, here we review the clinical evidence and discuss the potential role of nab-paclitaxel for the treatment of triple negative MBC, a subgroup typically characterized as having aggressive disease and limited treatment options.
