Analysis of the “stretched” state showed significantly increased IR at 5° ext, 0° flex, 15° flex, and 30° flex and increased distraction at 40N and 80N as compared to intact (Figure 1)(Table 1). Max extension increased by 6.6° between intact and stretched, however this was not statistically significant. Capsulotomy condition significantly increased ER and IR from intact at all flexion-extension positions. Furthermore, capsulotomy increased distraction at 40N and 80N, as well as max extension, as compared to intact. The repair restored IR back to the stretched state but not to the intact state at 5° ext and 0° flex (19.6° vs 24.5° and 21.8° vs 26.4°, respectively). The capsular shift significantly decreased IR compared to stretched state at 5° ext, 0°, and 15° flex, and at 5° ext and 0° compared to the vented state. Capsular shift restricted IR significantly more than repair at 5° ext, 0° flex, and 15° flex. Capsule shift and repair had similar effects on ER. Distraction distance at 40N and 80N was greater in the repair compared to the shift but this was not statistically significant. The capsular shift decreased distraction as compared to the stretched state but the repair did not. Maximum extension was significantly reduced back to the intact/vented state from the laxity state in the capsular shift but not in the repair.
