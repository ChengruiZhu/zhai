Ethanol has a vast consumption around the world. Many researches confirmed some adverse effect of this component on human health. In addition, recent studies showed significant alteration in both cellular population, and protein profile of human foreskin fibroblast cell line (HFFF2) in the specific dosage of ethanol. Here, the role and interaction of some proteins (characterized by significant alteration in expression due to ethanol effect) analyzed by proteomics and evaluated by considering cancerous case. 2D-electrophoresis findings of comparison of normal fibroblast cells and treated fibroblast with 270 mM dosage of ethanol analyzed by using SameSpots software, R software, and Cytoscape for protein-protein interaction (PPI) investigation. Six proteins with significantly altered expression associated with fundamental properties in a cell identified in ethanol-treated sample. These include AnnexinA5, Heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein A1, Rho-GDP dissociation inhibitor, Cathepsin L, Cu/Zn-SOD, Rho-GDP dissociation inhibitor, and Serpin peptidase inhibitor. Surprisingly, all these proteins were down-regulated and this pattern is similar to nasopharyngeal carcinoma-associated stromal fibroblast sample. Additionally, protein-protein interaction (PPI) indicates that HNRNPA1, SERPINE1 are hub proteins. Once their expression alters, it can impose vast changes on other molecular function. Based on this approach, ethanol may target same pathways that are related to cancer onset. In addition, some epidemiologicÂ studies proved that ethanol consumption is related to increment of cancer risk. Therefore, more investigation is required in this regard to elicit the feasible relationship.
