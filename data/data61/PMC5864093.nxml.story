All organisms require homeostasis mechanisms to maintain sufficient levels of zinc for normal cell metabolism and to avoid toxicity. As zinc-binding proteins are located in the cytosol and within intracellular compartments, all cells have to balance intracellular zinc ion distribution so that there are sufficient, but non toxic levels of zinc in the cytosol as well as organelles. Although much is known about the mechanisms that control cytosolic zinc levels, relatively little is known about the mechanisms that maintain organelle zinc homeostasis. As proteins belonging to the CDF family transport zinc into organelles, here we used a fission yeast model system to determine if the expression or function of zinc transporters belonging to this family was regulated by zinc. We find that two CDF family members, Cis4 and Zrg17, facilitate the transport of zinc out of the cytosol of zinc-deficient cells, whereas the CDF family member Zhf1 preferentially transports zinc out of the cytosol when zinc is not limiting. As the expression of the genes encoding these transport proteins is not regulated by zinc, the results suggest that different CDF family members have complementary roles in transporting zinc out of the cytosol that are independent of changes in transcription. These results provide new insights into the regulatory mechanisms that control cytosolic and organelle zinc homeostasis.
