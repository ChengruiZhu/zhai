A 32-year-old Caucasian female presented with septic shock and accompanying acute kidney injury (Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) = 18) to our ICU. In spite of a broad anti-infective regimen, adequate fluid resuscitation, and high doses of inotropics and catecholamines, she remained refractory hypotensive. The extraordinary severity of septic shock suggested an immense overwhelming host response assumingly accompanied by a notable cytokine storm such as known from patients with toxic shock syndrome. Thus, a CytoSorb® filter was added to the dialysis circuit to remove excess shock-perpetuating cytokines. To analyze the endothelial phenotype in vitro before and after extracorporeal cytokine removal, we tested the septic shock patient’s serum on human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs). The effect on endothelial integrity was assessed both on the morphological (fluorescent immunocytochemistry for VE-cadherin and F-actin) and functional (transendothelial electrical resistance (TER)) level that was recorded in real time with an “electric cell-substrate impedance sensing” (ECIS) system (ibidi). We found (1) severe alterations of cell-cell contacts and the cytoskeletal architecture and (2) profound functional permeability changes, the putative cellular correlate of the clinical vascular leakage syndrome. However, the endothelial barrier was protected from these profound adverse effects when HUVECs were challenged with septic shock serum that was collected after extracorporeal cytokine removal.
