The fundamental mechanisms underlying intercellular coordination during collective cell migration remain elusive despite considerable research efforts. We present a novel analytical framework that considers spatiotemporal dynamics across several traits. Our approach was applied to discover new modes of organized collective dynamics of cancer and normal cells. Following disruption of a cell monolayer, a propagating wave of coordinated migration emerges as clusters of coordinately moving cells are formed away from the wound and disintegrate near the advancing front. Activation of Met signal transduction by hepatocyte growth factor/scatter factor, master regulators of cell motility in malignant and normal processes, generates coinciding waves of cellular acceleration and stretching that propagate backward from the wound front and trigger a delayed wave of directional migration. Amplified coordination is intrinsically associated with enhanced directionality suggesting that even a weak directional cue is sufficient to promote a coordinated response that is transmitted to cells within the cell sheet. Our findings provide important novel insights on the basic cellular organization during collective cell migration and establish a mechanism of long-range cell guidance, intercellular coordination and pattern formation during monolayer wound healing.
