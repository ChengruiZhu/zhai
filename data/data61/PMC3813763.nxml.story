The aim of the present study was to investigate the expression profile and prognostic significance of uncoordinated 5 homolog 4 (UNC5H4) in patients with lung cancer and to evaluate whether UNC5H4 expression may serve as an index for radiosensitivity. UNC5H4 and p53 expression levels were detected by immunohistochemistry, apoptosis was determined by a terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick end labeling assay and caspase 3 activation was determined by western blotting. The results showed that UNC5H4 expression was largely located in the membrane of the normal bronchial epithelium, but absent in the membranous regions or ectopic cytoplasm of 80/130 (61.5%) non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) tissue samples. Abnormal UNC5H4 expression was demonstrated to correlate with the degree of differentiation (P=0.015), TNM staging (P=0.037). Cytoplasmic UNC5H4 expression was shown to correlate negatively with p53 mutant type (mt) expression (r=âˆ’0.270; P=0.002) and positively with the apoptotic index (r=0.254; P=0.004). The statistical analyses indicated that the prognosis of patients with normal UNC5H4 expression was improved compared with that of patients with abnormal UNC5H4 expression, however, no significant difference was identified (P=0.125). Exposure of NSCLC tissue samples to X-radiation increased UNC5H4 expression and caspase 3 activity significantly, irrespective of p53 mutation status. In conclusion, these results indicate that X-rays induce apoptosis via the p53 pathway, and when this pathway is compromised, an additional pathway is utilized.
