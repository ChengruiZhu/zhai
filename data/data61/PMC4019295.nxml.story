The Great East Japan Earthquake and subsequent tsunami destroyed large parts of Japan's Tohoku district. Special efforts were made regarding the prompt distribution of medical supplies, including insulin, for diabetic patients. However, many diabetic patients in the shelters lost their blood glucose control as a result of the unfavorable living environment. The high‚Äêcalorie food provided led to severe postprandial hyperglycemia. Furthermore, mental stress can aggravate diabetic control and these patients require special mental care. We have a few suggestions to propose in preparation for future disasters based on the experience gained from our shelter visits during this disaster. First, people in the affected areas had no way of accessing such information in the early days after the disaster. Therefore, we should consider the practical means of distributing important information in various situations. Second, guidelines and manuals for both diabetic patients and healthcare providers need to be created for the various situations that occur in the event of a natural disaster. We already have a few, but situations vary and several guidelines are required to cover different conditions. Manuals for the prescription of antidiabetic agents will be useful, especially for doctors who are not specialized in diabetes. Third, patients should be educated beforehand as to what to do and what to be prepared for in the case of a disaster; each of the various situations that might be encountered should be covered. Lectures about these issues might be included in educational classes for diabetic patients organized by each medical institution.
