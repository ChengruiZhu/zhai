72 cases were included in the study (9 bilateral). 72.2% of the cases were female, and the average age was 42,2 years (SD15,9). The average BMI was 24.4 kg/m2 (SD5,2). In 70.8% of patients a lateral release was associated to the tibial tubercle osteotomy. 77.8% of patients were evaluated clinically, the remaining, who were unable to come for the visits, were interviewed and the subjective scores were administered by phone. The average follow-up was 68.4 months (SD35.5).In 62.5% of cases a valgus lower limb alignment was detected, with 25% and 39.3% of patients having respectively an increased femoral antiversion and foot pronation. Post-operatively there was a statistical significant improvement in all the scores. No differences in the pre-operative and post-operative congruence angle or patellar tilt were detected (p>0.05). All the osteotomies were healed at the last follow-up. No major complications were detected. In 19 cases a further surgery was necessary, with 17 cases of hardware removal and one case of arthrofibrosis. In one case a major subsequent surgery was necessary (Total Knee Arthroplasty): the cumulative survivorship resulted equal to 92.3% (SD7.4%) at the final follow-up.At the multiple regression analysis, a lower WOMAC score was associated with increased age (> 45 years, OR=141.69), increased femoral antiversion (OR=69.94), poor post-operative muscular trophism (OR=127.61) and persistent post-operative pathologic Q angle (OR=18.84). Similarly, a lower Kujala score was associated with increased age (OR=8.36) and increased foot pronation (OR=5.10). Patientsâ€™ poor satisfaction was associated only to post-operative factors, such as presence of a positive Rabot test (OR=4.42) and poor muscolar trophism (OR=5.14).
