Identifying trait-relevant tissues is an important step towards understanding disease etiology. Computational methods have been recently developed to integrate SNP functional annotations generated from omics studies to genome-wide association studies (GWASs) to infer trait-relevant tissues. However, two important questions remain to be answered. First, with the increasing number and types of functional annotations nowadays, how do we integrate multiple annotations jointly into GWASs in a trait-specific fashion? Doing so would allow us to take advantage of the complementary information contained in these annotations to optimize the performance of trait-relevant tissue inference. Second, what to do with the inferred trait-relevant tissues? Here, we develop a new statistical method and software to make progress on both fronts. For the first question, we extend the commonly used linear mixed model, with new algorithms and inference strategies, to incorporate multiple annotations in a trait-specific fashion to improve trait-relevant tissue inference accuracy. For the second question, we rely on the close relationship between our proposed method and the widely-used sequence kernel association test, and use the inferred trait-relevant tissues, for the first time, to construct more powerful association tests. We illustrate the benefits of our method through extensive simulations and applications to a wide range of real data sets.
