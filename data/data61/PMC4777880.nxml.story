Glioma is a common malignacy of the brain that affects elderly patients in particular. Despite treatment, however, the survival rate is 12 months. The aim of the present study was to examine the therapeutic effect of neural progenitor cells (NPCs) on a glioma murine model, and to determine the possible mechanism of action. A glioma murine model was constructed and the tumor volume and tumor growth rate were measured. The therapeutic effect of cell injection on the glioma mouse model mice was confirmed. The quantitative polymerase chain reaction method was used to detect the expression of proto-oncogene and tumor suppressor gene. Intracranial injection of NPCs was performed to determine cell apoptosis. Preliminary results showed the mechanism of cell therapy effect at the transcription and cellular level. Compared with the model group, the tumor volume of the mice of the cell therapy group was significantly reduced from the 6th to 8th week, and the tumor growth rate was downregulated. The mechanism of action identified that NPCs regulate gene expression in tumor tissues, increase the expression of tumor suppressor gene, downregulate the gene expression of tumor cells, and reverse the proto-oncogene and imbalance of gene expression in gliomas. In conclusion, the new type of cell injection method can regulate the proto-oncogene of tumor tissue and tumor suppressor gene, improve the function phenotype of the cell, and effectively improve the clinical symptoms of mice with gliomas.
