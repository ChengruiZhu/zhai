The patient presented here was a 31-year-old female with unremarkable family history who presented initially complaining of intermittent abdominal pain. Abdominal CT scan revealed an inhomogeneous solid mass (13×9×7 cm) originating from the tail of the pancreas with splenic and gastric invasion as well as several pancreatic cysts. A nucleotide scan showed left adrenal involvement. The patient underwent tumor resection, splenectomy, partial gastrectomy, and left adrenalectomy. Histopathologic examination reported well-differentiated neuroendocrine carcinoma with low malignant potential of the tumor with splenic and adrenal involvement. Pancreatic cysts had benign component. Three years later, follow-up abdominal CT showed heterogeneously-enhanced solid nodules in both kidneys found to be renal cell carcinoma (RCC) on biopsy. At the same time, brain MRI showed cerebellar hemangioblastomas. Partial nephrectomy was done. Molecular genetic testing for demonstrated NM_000551.3: c.481C > T (p.R161* CGA>TGA), which has been reported previously in VHL disease. The next year, she developed peritonitis, which found to be the result of a perforated gastric ulcer. Histopathologic examination of the ulcer revealed neuroendocrine carcinoma. Then, the next year, a brain MRI revealed 4 solid and enhanced nodules in the cerebellum, suggesting multiple hemangioblastomas. Octreotide (Sandostatin
