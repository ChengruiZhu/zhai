Teucrium polium can reduce serum glucose. There are few reports in the literature related to this subject and the resolution of this mechanism requires further experiments. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the effects of Teucrium polium aerial parts extracts on oral glucose tolerance tests and pancreas histology in streptozocin-induced diabetic rats. In order to prepare the aqueous concentrate, aerial parts extract was dissolved in distilled water and was boiled for 30 minutes. For the preparation of ethanolic solution, powder was dissolved in ethanol and mixed by a shaker. Diabetic rats were induced with single IP injection of streptozotocin (STZ) at a dose of 50 mg/kg body weight dissolved in normal saline just before use to the 16 hr fast rats. Both groups, diabetic and normal were sacrificed by ether anesthesia. The tissue samples were formalin fixed and paraffin embedded for microscopic examination in accordance with routine laboratory procedures. Blood was collected from the tail vein of the rats. Serum glucose levels were then measured by commercial kits by using a glucose oxidized method. There were no biochemical abnormalities or histological changes in the pancreas of control rats. Post treatment of Teucrium polium aerial parts extract reduced the severity of streptozotocin diabetic pancreases. Our histopathological investigation along with the biochemical evaluations showed a significant effect on histological changes in the pancreas of induced diabetic rats upon Teucrium polium aerial parts extract treatment (P<0.05).
