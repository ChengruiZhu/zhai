The core organization of systems that relay information inside cells is preserved across vast evolutionary distances. Thus, detailed characterization of these systems’ crucial modules can provide insight into the emergence and adaptation of signaling pathways, and illuminate broadly relevant mechanisms that control cells’ diverse processes. In this paper we describe the first three-dimensional structure of a protein kinase–coactivator complex from budding yeast that is a key component of “hippo” signaling pathways, which direct cell proliferation, fate, and architecture in a wide range of eukaryotes. We show that this kinase–coactivator complex is a dynamic switch controlled by binding events distant from its active site, and that the kinase recognizes specific short motifs in disordered regions of target proteins by a previously unknown mechanism. This substrate docking interaction provides in vivo robustness to the kinase’s regulation of its known targets, and identifies likely new substrates that expand our view of this hippo pathway’s role in cell division. Moreover, during the course of evolution, the short motif that interacts with the kinase’s docking surface appears in rapidly changing intrinsically disordered regions of a number of proteins that are probably already in vivo substrates. Thus, our findings support the idea that proteins evolve more robust functional links to the signaling networks that control them by acquiring short peptide motifs that interface with key conserved signaling modules.
