Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is the most common endocrinopathy in women of reproductive age and also an important metabolic disorder associated with insulin resistance (IR). Hyperandrogenism is a key feature of PCOS. However, whether hyperandrogenism can cause IR in PCOS remains largely unknown. The mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) and its regulated autophagy are closely associated with IR. In the present study, we investigated the role of mTORC1-autophagy pathway in skeletal muscle IR in a dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA)-induced PCOS mouse model. DHEA-treated mice exhibited whole-body and skeletal muscle IR, along with the activated mTORC1, repressed autophagy, impaired mitochondria, and reduced plasma membrane glucose transporter 4 (GLUT4) expression in skeletal muscle of the mice. In cultured C2C12 myotubes, treatment with high dose testosterone activated mTORC1, reduced autophagy, impaired mitochondria, decreased insulin-stimulated glucose uptake, and induced IR. Inhibition of mTORC1 or induction of autophagy restored mitochondrial function, up-regulated insulin-stimulated glucose uptake, and increased insulin sensitivity. On the contrary, inhibition of autophagy exacerbated testosterone-induced impairment. Our findings suggest that the mTORC1-autophagy pathway might contribute to androgen excess-induced skeletal muscle IR in prepubertal female mice by impairing mitochondrial function and reducing insulin-stimulated glucose uptake. These data would help understanding the role of hyperandrogenism and the underlying mechanism in the pathogenesis of skeletal muscle IR in PCOS.
