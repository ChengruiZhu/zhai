Large maxillofacial defects from malignant tumor treatment are rarely rehabilitated by surgical reconstruction alone. Ameloblastic carcinoma, a rare aggressive odontogenic malignant tumor, requires wide surgical excision to gain a tumor-free margin. In the post-surgical defect, prosthetic rehabilitation is the treatment of choice to restore function and esthetics. Moreover, an intra-oral prosthesis such as an obturator restores speech, mastication and deglutition. Retention of the obturator is a major problem while rehabilitating large defects. The existing anatomical structures from the defect with the help of magnet attachments are suitable to enhance retention, stability and support of the prostheses. 
This case report presents a patient with an intraoral and extra-oral combination defect following surgical resection of ameloblastic carcinoma and describes the prosthetic techniques and design considerations for a magnet-retained obturator and mid-facial prosthesis. An implant-retained mid-facial prosthesis was fabricated. The retention of combined prostheses was obtained from the remaining right posterior teeth only. The patient had an unfavorable defect due to the large size and presence of scar contracture that vertically tends to dislodge the obturator. Magnet attachments were used to combine the facial and oral prosthesis, minimize the vertical dislodging forces and enhance retention. In addition, the retention was also gained from the scar band at lower border of mid-facial defect that avoided the need for more implants surgery. Magnet attachment with anatomical structure of the mid-facial defect provides an acceptable means of retention in large extraoral-intraoral combinations defects, improving the function, esthetic and the patientsâ€™ quality of life.
