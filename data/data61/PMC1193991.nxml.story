Variation is the fuel of natural selection. Understanding the mutational processes that underlie evolution has long been a central objective of population genetics. Today, amidst a computational revolution in biology, such understanding is pivotal to progress in many biological disciplines. For example, neutral mutations make the molecular clock tick, and this clock is fundamental to reconstructing phylogenies, measuring recombination rates, and detecting genetic functionality. In this manuscript, the researchers provide an original perspective on a long-standing question in evolutionary biology: to what extent do mutation rates evolve? They argue that to cope with environmental fluctuation, populations can evolve their phenotypic mutation rate without changing their genetic mutation rate. That is, populations can evolve “genetic potential”—a heightened sensitivity to the effects of mutation. The researchers use a simple mathematical model of amino acid evolution to illustrate the evolution of genetic potential, and show that as environmental variability decreases, evolving populations reach three distinct states. In a rapidly fluctuating environment, organisms evolve the flexibility to cope with variation within an individual lifetime; in moderately variable environments, populations evolve the ability to evolve rapidly; and in fairly constant environments, populations evolve robustness against the adverse effects of mutation.
