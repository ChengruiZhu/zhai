Membrane proteins which selectively bind to the Fc portion of IgG were identified in the Nonidet P-40 extracts of radiolabeled thioglycollate- elicited mouse peritoneal macrophages. Affinity columns of various IgG preparations coupled to Sepharose 4B were used to absorb the Fc-binding proteins. Analysis of the acetic acid or sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) eluates from aggregated human IgG or antigen-complexed rabbit IgG columns revealed two Fc(gamma)/-specific proteins with apparent 67,000 and 52,000 mol wt. These proteins were not detected in acid or SDS eluates from F(abâ€™)(2) columns or in eluates from IgG column, over which were passed lysates of Fc receptor-negative cells. With the use of affinity columns that contained aggregated mouse myeloma proteins of different IgG subclasses, we found that the 67,000-dahon protein selectively binds to IgG2a, whereas the 52,000-dalton protein binds to IgG1 and IgG2b. Neither protein was found in SDS eluates from IgG3 columns. Trypsin treatment of the macrophages before detergent lysis removed the 67,000-dalton protein, although it leaves intact the 52,000-dalton protein. These results provide structural confirmation for the existence of separate Fc receptors on mouse macrophages and indicate that the two Fc-binding proteins identified in this study represent all or part of the trypsin- sensitive Fc receptor which binds IgG2a and the trypsin-resistant Fc receptor which binds IgG2b and IgG1.
