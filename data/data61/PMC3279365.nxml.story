Information processing in the brain was classically thought to rely solely on neurons, whereas astrocytes, the most abundant glial cells in the brain, were considered supportive cells for neurons. However, astrocytes are known to respond to neuronal signals and regulate the function of synapses, so they may indeed serve active roles during information processing and storage in the brain. We investigated whether these phenomena occur in vivo and whether astrocytes participate in synaptic plasticity and long-term potentiation (LTP), which are thought to represent the cellular basis of learning and memory. We found that sensory stimulation in rodents triggers the activity of neurons that release the neurotransmitter acetylcholine and activates astrocytes in the hippocampus, a brain region involved in learning and memory. Acetylcholine elevates intracellular calcium in astrocytes, which then stimulates the release of glutamate, another neurotransmitter. Glutamate released from astrocytes acts on synaptic receptors, increasing synaptic strength and leading to LTP of the efficacy of transmission in synapses. This is the first demonstration of the direct involvement of astrocytes in the generation of in vivo LTP. We suggest that astrocytes are cellular sources of signals underlying synaptic plasticity and are directly involved in memory processes and brain information storage.
