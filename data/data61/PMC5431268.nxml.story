Musashi-1, an evolutionally conserved RNA-binding protein, has been implicated in the promotion of pathological stem cell proliferation, including tumorigenesis. The objective of the present study was to evaluate the expression of Musashi-1 protein and its implications in the progression and prognosis of gastric cancer. The expression level of Musashi-1 protein in gastric cancer was determined by western blotting and immunohistochemistry, and compared with the clinicopathological parameters. The present study revealed that the expression level of Musashi-1 protein in gastric cancer was significantly upregulated and correlated with the tumor size, tumor-node-metastasis (TNM) stage, Lauren classification, depth of invasion, vessel invasion, lymph node metastasis and distant metastasis. The mean survival time for patients with low expression levels of Musashi-1 was significantly longer compared with patients with high expression levels of Musashi-1. For each TNM stage, the mean survival time for patients with a low Musashi-1 expression levels was also significantly longer compared with patients with a high Musashi-1 expression level. Notably, TNM stage II patients with a low Musashi-1 expression level demonstrated a longer mean survival time compared with TNM stage I patients with high Musashi-1 expression level (56.8 vs. 42.3 months; P=0.001), and TNM stage III patients with low Musashi-1 expression level exhibited a longer mean survival time compared with TNM stage II patients with a high Musashi-1 expression level (44.0 vs. 33.8 months; P=0.034). Multivariate Cox's regression test demonstrated that Musashi-1 protein expression level was an independent prognostic indicator for the survival rate of the patients with gastric cancer. The results of the present study highlighted an important role for Musashi-1 protein in the progression of gastric cancer. The detection of the Musashi-1 protein expression level alone or in combination with TNM staging may aid the prediction of the prognosis of patients with gastric cancer.
