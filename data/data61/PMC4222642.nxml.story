Mathematical models are commonly used to better understand viral infections. Equations are simply rules to describe behavior of viruses, infected cells and the immune response, and are tested for their ability to reproduce serial viral levels in infected persons. Models provide insights regarding the pace of viral replication and timing of the immune response. Here we describe Herpes Simplex Virus-2 (HSV-2), an infection that defies standard modeling approaches. HSV-2 is sexually transmitted, and causes recurrent genital ulcers and frequent asymptomatic genital shedding episodes. Episodes initiate in a seemingly random fashion. Viral loads are erratic and complex during single episodes. We developed a mathematical model, which suggests that in general, shedding variability is due to heterogeneous density of immune cells in the genital tract. Yet, our model is unable to predict viral loads over time in individual patients. Here we employ several statistical tools to demonstrate that HSV-2 shedding is highly unpredictable, akin to weather patterns. Based on available spatial assessments of current viral and immunologic conditions, shedding can only be predicted over a few days, but not over ensuing weeks. These results have important clinical implications, and highlight limitations of attempting to predict outcomes in complex systems with simple mechanistic models.
