Histone H1.0 belongs to the class of linker histones (H1), although it is substantially distinct from other histone H1 family members. The differences can be observed in the chromosomal location and organization of the histone H1.0 encoding gene, as well as in the length and composition of its amino acid chain. Whereas somatic (H1.1â€“H1.5) histone H1 variants are synthesized in the cell cycle S-phase, histone H1.0 is synthesized throughout the cell cycle. By replacing somatic H1 variants during cell maturation, histone H1.0 is gradually deposited in low dividing cells and achieves the highest level of expression in the terminally differentiated cells. Compared to other differentiation-specific H1 histone (H5) characteristic for unique tissue and organisms, the distribution of histone H1.0 remains non-specific. Classic investigations emphasize that histone H1.0 is engaged in the organization of nuclear chromatin accounting for formation and maintenance of its nucleosomal and higher-order structure, and thus influences gene expression. However, the recent data confirmed histone H1.0 peculiar localization in the nucleolus and unexpectedly revealed its potential for regulation of nucleolar, RNA-dependent, activity via interaction with other proteins. According to such findings, histone H1.0 participates in the formation of gene-coded information through its control at both transcriptional and translational levels. In order to reappraise the biological significance of histone H1.0, both aspects of its activity are presented in this review.
