Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is the most prevalent liver disease in developed countries. The incidence of NAFLD in the general population is 30–38% deppending on the geographical area and the diagnostic method used. NAFLD is considered to be the liver manifestation of the metabolic syndrome. A better understanding of the natural evolution would have practical consequences related mainly to the need of early and aggressive diagnosis, active monitoring and therapeutic solutions. Cardiovascular disease appears to be the main cause of death in these patients. The mechanisms linking NAFLD with cardiovascular disease are not fully understood yet, but attention was focused primarily on insulin resistance. The visceral adipose tissue, the epicardial adipose tissue, the systemic inflammatory response syndrome, the lipid profile, the procoagulants factors, the oxidative stress, and type 2 diabetes mellitus, they all might play a role in the link between NAFLD and cardiovascular disease. Currently, there isn’t any medication specifically recommended for the treatment of NAFLD. Although the mechanisms underlying the association between NAFLD and cardiovascular disease are not fully known, attention must be paid to this association, given that these patients are more likely to die due to heart disease rather than liver disease.
