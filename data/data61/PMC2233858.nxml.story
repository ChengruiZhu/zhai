Pore-blocking toxins are valuable probes of ion channels that underlie electrical signaling. To be effective inhibitors, they must show high affinity and specificity and prevent ion conduction. The 22-residue sea snail peptide, μ-conotoxin GIIIA, blocks the skeletal muscle sodium channel completely. Partially blocking peptides, derived by making single or paired amino acid substitutions in μ-conotoxin GIIIA, allow a novel analysis of blocking mechanisms. Replacement of one critical residue (Arg-13) yielded peptides that only partially blocked single-channel current. These derivatives, and others with simultaneous substitution of a second residue, were used to elucidate the structural basis of the toxin's blocking action. The charge at residue-13 was the most striking determinant. A positive charge was necessary, though not sufficient, for complete block. Blocking efficacy increased with increasing residue-13 side chain size, regardless of charge, suggesting a steric contribution to inhibition. Charges grouped on one side of the toxin molecule at positions 2, 12, and 14 had a weaker influence, whereas residue-16, on the opposite face of the toxin, was more influential. Most directly interpreted, the data suggest that one side of the toxin is masked by close apposition to a binding surface on the pore, whereas the other side, bearing Lys-16, is exposed to an aqueous cavity accessible to entering ions. Strong charge-dependent effects emanate from this toxin surface. In the native toxin, Arg-13 probably presents a strategically placed electrostatic barrier rather than effecting a complete steric occlusion of the pore. This differs from other well-described channel inhibitors such as the charybdotoxin family of potassium channel blockers and the sodium channel-blocking guanidinium toxins (tetrodotoxin and saxitoxin), which appear to occlude the narrow part of the pore.
