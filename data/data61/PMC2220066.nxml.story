Models of coronary arterial trees are generated by the algorithm of constrained constructive optimization (CCO). In a given perfusion area a binary branching network of straight cylindrical tubes is generated by
successively adding terminal segments to the growing structure. In each step the site of connection is chosen according to an optimization target function (total intravascular volume), and in any stage of development the tree
fulfills physiologic boundary conditions (constraints involving pressures, flows and bifurcation rules). CCO generates structures which in many aspects resemble real coronary arterial trees, except for very asymmetric bifurcations, occurring when a large branch gives off a tiny terminal segment. In the present work we evaluate an additional constraint within CCO, namely imposing a limit on the asymmetry of bifurcations during the construction
process. Model trees are grown with different limits imposed, and the effects on structure are studied both phenomenologically and via statistical descriptors. As the limit to asymmetry is tightened, blood is conveyed to the
perfusion sites via detours rather than directly and the comparison with measured data shows the structure to
change from a conveying to a delivering type of function. Simultaneously total intravascular volume, surface and
sum of segments' lengths increase. It is shown why and how local bifurcation asymmetry is able to determine the
global structure of the optimized arterial tree model. Surprisingly, the pressure profile from inlet to terminals, being a functional characteristic, remains unaffected.
