Chromatin, a complex of DNA wrapped around histone proteins, impacts all DNA-templated processes, including gene expression. Cells employ various strategies to alter chromatin structure and control access to the genetic material. Nucleosomes, the building blocks of chromatin, are subject to a myriad of modifications on their constituent histone proteins. One highly conserved modification with important connections to human health is the addition of ubiquitin to histone H2B. H2B ubiquitylation modulates chromatin structure during gene transcription and acts as a master regulator for downstream histone modifications. The proteins that promote H2B ubiquitylation have been identified; however, little is known about how these proteins interface with the nucleosome. Here, we exploited the genetic tools of budding yeast to reveal features of the nucleosome that are required for H2B ubiquitylation. Our genetic screen identified amino acids on the nucleosome acidic patch, a negatively charged region on the nucleosome surface, as being important for this process. The acidic patch is critical for regulating chromatin transactions, and, in our study, we identified roles for the acidic patch throughout transcription. Our data reveal that the acidic patch recruits histone modifiers, regulates histone modifications within the H2B ubiquitylation cascade, and maintains transcriptional fidelity.
