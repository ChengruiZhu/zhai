Calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) is linked to neurogenic inflammation and to migraine. Activation of the trigeminovascular system plays a prominent role during migraine attacks with the release of CGRP. The trigeminal ganglion (TG) contains three main cell types: neurons, satellite glial cells (SGC) and Schwann cells; the first two have before been studied in vitro separately. Culture of rat TG provides a method to induce inflammation and the possibility to evaluate the different cell types in the TG simultaneously. We investigated expression levels of various inflammatory cytokines on mRNA level using RT-PCR arrays and qRT-PCR; furthermore expression at protein level was studied using immunohistochemistry. We report that (1) organ culture of the TG is possible with preserved morphology, (2) organ culture is associated with enhanced expression of cytokines and mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) primarily in neurons, (3) CGRP can induce expression of some cytokines and (4) cytokine expression is still upregulated following MAPK pathway inhibition by MEK inhibitor U0126 and pp38 inhibitor SB202192, but the cytokine expression is abolished when co-incubating with the JNK inhibitor SP600125. This method may be of value to examine local TG inflammation, putatively involved in the pathophysiology of some forms of primary headaches.
