A cohort of 18 collegiate football athletes treated with suture anchor thumb UCL repair at minimum 2 years post-procedure was identified. All 18 patients (100%) were available for evaluation at average 6.0 years follow-up (range, 2.5-9.5 yrs). Nine players were skill position players (WR, TE, RB) while the remaining 9 were non-skill positions (OL, DL, LB.) Average age was 19.7 yrs (range, 18-22 yrs). Average time from injury until surgery was 27 days (range 2-105 days). Average return to play for the entire cohort was 5.4 weeks postoperatively (range, 1.5-12.0 weeks). All players returned to at least the same level of play as preoperatively (collegiate). Seven players eventually continued to play professional football. The average QuickDASH score for the entire cohort was 1.2/100 (95% CI 0.40-2.26). Average QuickDASH Work Score was 0.0/100 (95% CI 0.0-0.0) and average QuickDASH Sport Score was 0.7/100 (95% CI 0.0-1.85). Average time to surgery for skill position (n=9) players was 12 days (range 2-26 days) compared to 43 days (range 10-105) in non-skilled (n=9) position players (p = 0.025). Average return to play for skill position players was 7.0 weeks postoperatively (range 4-12 weeks) compared to 3.8 weeks (range 1.5-8.0 weeks) postoperatively in the non-skilled cohort (p = 0.027). There was no difference in average QuickDASH overall score, work score or sport score between the cohorts (Table I).
