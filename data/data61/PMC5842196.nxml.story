 mutant cancers, but is also an increasingly recognized problem for immunotherapies. One of the major obstacles of successful cancer therapy is tumor heterogeneity of genotypic and phenotypic features. Historically, drivers for drug resistance have been suspected and found on the genetic level, with mutations either being pre-existing in a subset of cancer cells or emerging de novo to mediate drug resistance. In contrast to that, our group and others identified a non-mutational adaptive response, resulting in a reversible, drug tolerant, slow cycling phenotype that precedes the emergence of permanent drug resistance and is triggered by prolonged drug exposure. More recently, studies described the importance of initially reversible transcriptional reprogramming for the development of acquired drug resistance, identified factors important for the survival of the slow cycling phenotype and investigated the relationship of mutational and non-mutational resistance mechanisms. However, the connection and relative importance of mutational and adaptive drug resistance in relation to the in vitro models at hand and the clinically observed response patterns remains poorly defined. In this review we focus on adaptive intrinsic phenotypic plasticity in cancer cells that leads to the drug tolerant slow cycling state, which eventually transitions to permanent resistance, and propose a general model based on current literature, to describe the development of acquired drug resistance.
