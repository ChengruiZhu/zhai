Breast cancer is a heterogeneous disease, with highly variable disease outcomes and responses to treatment for otherwise indistinguishable tumors. Understanding this heterogeneity holds the key to better determining disease prognosis and tailoring treatments to the tumors for which they will be most efficacious. Some of the most successful work dissecting the differences between histologically identical tumors with differing disease outcomes has come from profiling the array of protein-coding transcripts present in every tumor and dividing the breast cancer profiles into multiple subtypes of varying aggressiveness. Importantly, these profiles are now being used in the clinic to predict disease outcome and plan treatment. Using a similar molecular-profiling strategy, we have identified a previously unrecognized subset of breast cancers in which the tumor suppressor gene REST is lost, which display a highly aggressive disease course. Intriguingly, we have traced the loss of the tumor suppressor to the presence of a variant of the REST protein normally found in the brain following seizures, which represents a unique and attractive therapeutic target. Additionally, the gene signature used to identify RESTâ€“less tumors shows no overlap with the profiles currently used in the clinic to assess tumor aggressiveness and may be an important new diagnostic tool.
