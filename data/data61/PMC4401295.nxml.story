 neurokinin 1 receptor (NK1 R), plays an important role in mediating a variety of inflammatory processes. Its interaction with chemokines is known to play a crucial role in the pathogenesis of acute pancreatitis. In pancreatic acinar cells, substance P stimulates the release of NFκB-driven chemokines. However, the signal transduction pathways by which substance P-NK1 R interaction induces chemokine production are still unclear. To that end, we went on to examine the participation of mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) in substance P-induced synthesis of pro-inflammatory chemokines, monocyte chemoanractant protein-1 (MCP-I), macrophage inflammatory protein-lα (MIP-lα) and macrophage inflammatory protein-2 (MIP-2), in pancreatic acini. In this study, we observed a time-dependent activation of ERK1/2, c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), NFκB and activator protein-1 (AP-1) when pancreatic acini were stimulated with substance P. Moreover, substance P-induced ERK 1/2, JNK, NFκB and AP-1 activation as well as chemokine synthesis were blocked by pre-treatment with either extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase kinase 1 (MEK1) inhibitor or JNK inhibitor. In addition, substance P-induced activation of ERK 112, JNK, NFκB and AP-1-driven chemokine production were attenuated by CP96345, a selective NK1 R antagonist, in pancreatic acinar cells. Taken together, these results suggest that substance P-NK1 R induced chemokine production depends on the activation of MAPKs-mediated NFκB and AP-1 signalling pathways in mouse pancreatic acini.
