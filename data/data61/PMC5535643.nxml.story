If we try to draw conclusions about events, analyse data or results (in one or a certain area) and clarify our unknown points in standard or non-standard ways, this leads to the transfer of experience from one area to another. How do we want to follow guidelines, while the most of the obligatory laws are not followed, for example? The aim of prescriptions or recommendations in medicine, for example, (or the laws of a country that do not usually apply to particular classes or castes, as well as business rules) is to give guidance on how it would be appropriate to help people or ourselves (as we have already mentioned) and the people themselves. Unfortunately, this behaviour is also characteristic of developed societies that dictate the rules and try to help … to people, as well. If we come deeper into the system of mutual aid in medicine, it is unfortunate that sometimes the condition of this kind of “ecosystem” (or any of the ecosystems described) is worse than the best tragic-comedy. Unfortunately, the “ecosystem of medicine” is also subordinate and slaves somehow to the stronger “ecosystems” as politics and business and is dependent on them, but for evil or good, these ecosystems have glimpsed at times, no matter what are the motives, which provoke them! And they are most often … once again personal. Although in a number of Eastern European countries, it was unthinkable to even undesirable until recently, that dermasurgery and dermatooncology to be part of modern dermatological societies, the insatiable thirst for growth of young specialists, as well as the impact of Western schools, on their formation as a kind of new hope proved to be stronger in the formation of dermatosurgery, not only all over the world, but also in particular in the Balkans and Bulgaria. These units are gradually being introduced as an indispensable part of any modern clinic, and this part guarantees the best results (in patients with dermatosurgical or dermatooncological needs). The globalisation of dermatology and dermatological science has led to the introduction and involvement of additional auxiliary units, based on a more global concept of the interdisciplinary concept that encompasses psycho-neuroendocrine dermatology which provides a good explanation for some unexplained diseases, such as vitiligo, for example.
