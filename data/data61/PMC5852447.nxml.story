Purpose: to present the mid-term results of canaloplasty in a small cohort of corticosteroid glaucoma patients. Material and Methods: Nine eyes from seven patients with various types of corticosteroid glaucoma in maximum medical therapy underwent canaloplasty. Patients underwent complete ophthalmic examination every six months. Success was defined as: post-operative intraocular pressure (IOP) ≤ 21 mmHg and ≤ 16 mmHg without (“complete success”), and with/without medical treatment (“qualified success”). The IOP reduction had to be ≥ 20. The number of medications before and after surgery was considered. The follow-up mean period was 32.7 ± 20.8 months (range 14–72 months). Results: The pre-operative mean IOP was 30.7 ± 7.2 mmHg (range: 24–45). The mean IOP at 6 and 12-month follow-up was 13.1 ± 2.6 mmHg, and 13.7 ± 1.9 mmHg, respectively. Qualified and complete success at 6 and 12 months was 100% for both of the two definitions. The number of medications used preoperatively and at the 12-month follow-up was 4.3 ± 0.7, and 0.2 ± 1.0, respectively. No serious complication was observed. Conclusions: The mid-term results of canaloplasty in patients with corticosteroid-induced glaucoma appear to be very promising. Canaloplasty should be considered as a possible alternative to filtering surgery in this form of glaucoma, when medical therapy is not sufficient to maintain the IOP within reasonable limits.
