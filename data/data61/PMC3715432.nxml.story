Changes in the position of genes within the nucleus and in their local organisation frequently correlate with whether or not genes are turned on. However, little is known about how such nuclear organisation is controlled and whether this can be separated from the mechanisms that promote transcription. We show here that central nuclear position and chromatin de-compaction correlate with onset of expression at key neural differentiation gene loci in the mouse embryo. Conversely, the locus of a gene that is down-regulated as neural differentiation commences exhibits a shift towards the nuclear periphery as this takes place. Importantly, we show that signalling through the fibroblast growth factor (FGF) pathway regulates changes at this level of nuclear organisation. FGF represses differentiation gene transcription and keeps differentiation gene loci compact and at the nuclear periphery. By blocking FGF signalling in a retinoid deficient embryo in which differentiation genes are not expressed, we further show that control of nuclear organisation by FGF is not just a consequence of gene transcription. These findings are the first to demonstrate that such higher order nuclear organisation is regulated in the developing embryo, that this takes place downstream of FGF signaling, and can be uncoupled from the machinery of gene transcription.
