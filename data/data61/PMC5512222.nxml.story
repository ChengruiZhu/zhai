Intense biological conflicts between prokaryotic genomes and their genomic parasites have resulted in an arms race in terms of the molecular “weaponry” deployed on both sides. Using a recursive computational approach, we uncovered a remarkable class of multidomain proteins with 2 to 15 domains in the same polypeptide deployed by viruses and plasmids in such conflicts. Domain architectures and genomic contexts indicate that they are part of a widespread conflict strategy involving proteins injected into the host cell along with parasite DNA during the earliest phase of infection. Their unique feature is the combination of domains with highly disparate biochemical activities in the same polypeptide; accordingly, we term them polyvalent proteins. Of the 131 domains in polyvalent proteins, a large fraction are enzymatic domains predicted to modify proteins, target nucleic acids, alter nucleotide signaling/metabolism, and attack peptidoglycan or cytoskeletal components. They further contain nucleic acid-binding domains, virion structural domains, and 40 novel uncharacterized domains. Analysis of their architectural network reveals both pervasive common themes and specialized strategies for conjugative elements and plasmids or (pro)phages. The themes include likely processing of multidomain polypeptides by zincin-like metallopeptidases and mechanisms to counter restriction or CRISPR/Cas systems and jump-start transcription or replication. DNA-binding domains acquired by eukaryotes from such systems have been reused in XPC/RAD4-dependent DNA repair and mitochondrial genome replication in kinetoplastids. Characterization of the novel domains discovered here, such as RNases and peptidases, are likely to aid in the development of new reagents and elucidation of the spread of antibiotic resistance.
