Accumulating evidence demonstrates that complement activation is involved in the pathogenesis of osteoarthritis (OA). However, the intimate complement regulation and cross talk with other signaling pathways in joint-associated tissues remain incompletely understood. Recent insights are summarized and discussed here, to put together a more comprehensive picture of complement involvement in OA pathogenesis. Complement is regulated by several catabolic and inflammatory mediators playing a key role in OA. It seems to be involved in many processes observed during OA development and progression, such as extracellular cartilage matrix (ECM) degradation, chondrocyte and synoviocyte inflammatory responses, cell lysis, synovitis, disbalanced bone remodeling, osteophyte formation, and stem cell recruitment, as well as cartilage angiogenesis. In reverse, complement can be activated by various ECM components and their cleavage products, which are released during OA-associated cartilage degradation. There are, however, some other cartilage ECM components that can inhibit complement, underlining the diverse effects of ECM on the complement activation. It is hypothesized that complement might also be directly activated by mechanical stress, thereby contributing to OA. The question arises whether keeping the complement activation in balance could represent a future therapeutic strategy in OA treatment and in the prevention of its progression.
