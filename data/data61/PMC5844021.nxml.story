For several years, the cause of autosomal recessive mental retardation has been attributed to the deletion or mutation of a gene named tumor suppressor candidate 3 (TUSC3). Previous research has identified that TUSC3 is a potential tumor suppressor gene in oral epidermoid carcinoma, lung cancer and esophageal cancer. However, to the best of our knowledge, no previously published data has existed on the expression of TUSC3 in gliomas. The present study focused on the expression of TUSC3 in brain gliomas. Additionally, the present study sought to identify he association between TUSC3 expression and the typical clinical and pathological disease manifestations of gliomas. TUSC3 levels were evaluated using a western blot assay and immunohistochemistry on tissue microarray slides. Results indicated a significant decrease in TUSC3 expression in glioma tissues compared with the normal adjacent tissues. Furthermore, TUSC3 expression and World Health Organization grade demonstrated an inverse association in patients with glioma. This revealed that lower levels of TUSC3 in gliomas may be associated with a poorly-differentiated (high grade) tumor and thus a higher malignancy. Through the combination of the results of the present study and future research projects, TUSC3 may be a novel grading tool that assists with evaluating tumor malignancy and consequently a more active therapeutic regimen may be used in patients with glioma.
