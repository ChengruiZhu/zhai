The prognosis of patients with esophageal cancer improves by using neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC). More patients obtain pathological N0 staging (pN0) after surgery. The heterogeneity of prognosis of these patients poses a great challenge of customizing therapeutic strategies for individual patients. The signs of lymph nodes on both pre and post NAC computer tomography (CT) scan can provide more information for evaluation. Therefore, we investigated a new approach to lymph node (LN)-survival analysis by using pre-/post-NAC CT in pN0 esophageal cancer. 79 patients undergone curative resection after NAC obtained pN0 staging. The long and short axis diameter of maximal lymph node (MaxLN) and LN number on pre-/post-NAC CT scans were recorded and assessed for predicting survival by univariate and multivariate survival analysis. The prognosis of patients with esophageal cancer was correlated with the LN size and number on pre-/post-NAC CT. The LN number on pre-NAC CT and short-axis diameter of MaxLN on post-NAC CT remained the independent predictor of overall survival. By using these two factors as classification criterion, N0b group included patients with LN number>4 on pre-NAC CT or short-axis diameter of MaxLN >7 mm on post-NAC CT and the rest patients were included in N0a group. N0a group had a significantly better overall survival than N0b group (5-year survival rate: 75.2% vs. 32.6%). The size and number of lymph node on pre-/post-NAC CT were reliable and important prognostic factors in patients with pN0 esophageal cancer. This new criterion could distinguish these patients into N0a and N0b, according to different prognosis.
