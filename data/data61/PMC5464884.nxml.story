Expression of T-cell markers, generally investigated for immunophenotyping of T-cell lymphomas, is also observed in several types of B-cell lymphomas, including diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL). We previously reported that CD5 expression in DLBCL is an inferior prognostic factor in the era of rituximab. However, data regarding the frequencies, histological relevance, and prognostic importance of T-cell markers other than CD5 are currently unavailable. In the present study, we comprehensively evaluated the expression of T-cell markers (CD2, CD3, CD4, CD5, CD7, and CD8) in 501 B-cell lymphomas, including 225 DLBCLs, by flow cytometry and subsequent immunohistochemistry. T-cell markers other than CD5, such as CD2, CD4, CD7, and CD8, were expressed in 27 (5%) patients, and notably, all of these cases were classified as large B-cell lymphoma subtypes: 25 DLBCLs and 2 intravascular large B-cell lymphomas. CD5 and other T-cell markers were expressed in 15% (31/225) and 10% (25/225) of DLBCL cases, respectively. Five of them co-expressed CD5 and other T-cell markers. Retrospectively analyzing the prognostic relevance of T-cell markers in 169 patients with primary DLBCL treated with rituximab-based chemotherapy, we showed that only CD5 was a strong predictor of poor survival. This study provides information about the occurrence of T-cell markers other than CD5 in B-cell lymphomas, their frequent histological subtypes, and their prognostic significance in DLBCL. CD5 was reconfirmed as a negative prognostic marker in DLBCL patients receiving rituximab-inclusive chemotherapy, whereas T-cell markers other than CD5 were found to have no impact on clinicopathological and survival analyses.
