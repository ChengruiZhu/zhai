The purpose of this study was to find ways of reducing changes of sire predicted transmitting ability for type’s final scores (PTATs) from the first to second crop of daughters. The PTATs were estimated from two datasets: D01 (scores recorded up to 2001) and D05 (scores recorded up to 2005). The PTAT changes were calculated as the difference between the evaluations based on D01 and D05. The PTATs were adjusted to a common genetic base of all evaluated cows born in 1995. The single-trait (ST) animal model included the fixed effects of the herd–year–season–classifier, age by year group at classification, stage of lactation at classification, registry status of animals, and additive genetic and permanent environment random effects. Unknown parent groups (UPGs) were defined based on every other birth year starting from 1972. Modifications to the ST model included the usage of a single record per cow, separate UPGs for first and second crop daughters, separate UPGs for sires and dams, and deepened pedigrees for dams with missing phenotypic records. Also, the multiple-trait (MT) model treated records of registered and grade cows as correlated traits. The mean PTAT change, for all of the sires, was close to zero in all of the models analyzed. The estimated mean PTAT change for 145 sires with 40 to 100 first crop and ≥200 second crop daughters was −0.33, −0.20, −0.13, −0.28, and −0.12 with ST, only first records, only last records, updated pedigrees, and allowing separate parent groups (PGs) for sires and dams after updating the pedigrees, respectively. The percentages of sires showing PTAT decline were reduced from 74.5 (with ST) to 57.3 by using only the last records of cows, and to 56.4 by allowing separate UPGs for sires and dams after updating the pedigrees. Though updating of the pedigrees alone was not effective, separate UPGs for sires together with additional pedigree was helpful in reducing the bias.
