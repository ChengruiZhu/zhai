Metastasis represents a key factor associated with poor prognosis of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSC). However, the underlying molecular mechanisms remain largely unknown. In this study, our liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry analysis revealed a number of significantly differentially expressed membrane/membrane-associated proteins between high invasive UM1 and low invasive UM2 cells. One of the identified membrane proteins, Syntenin-1, was remarkably up-regulated in HNSC tissues and cell lines when compared to the controls, and also over-expressed in recurrent HNSC and high invasive UM1 cells. Syntenin-1 over-expression was found to be significantly associated with lymph node metastasis and disease recurrence. HNSC patients with higher syntenin-1 expression had significantly poorer long term overall survival and similar results were found in many other types of cancers based on analysis of The Cancer Genome Atlas data. Finally, knockdown of syntenin-1 inhibited the proliferation, migration and invasion of HNSC cells, and opposite findings were observed when syntenin-1 was over-expressed. Collectively, our studies indicate that syntenin-1 promotes invasion and progression of HNSC. It may serve as a valuable biomarker for lymph node metastasis or a potential target for therapeutic intervention in HNSC.
