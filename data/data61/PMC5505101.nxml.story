Total hip arthroplasty (THA) is one of the successful and cost-benefit surgical treatments. One-stage bilateral THA (BTHA) has a large number of advantages, although there are concerns about the higher complications in this procedure. Aim of our study was to evaluate the complications and outcomes of cementless one-stage BTHA in osteoarthritis patients. A total of 147 patients from 2009 till 2012, underwent one-stage BTHA in Milad and Erfan hospitals, Tehran, Iran. A prospective analysis of the functional outcomes and complications of one-stage BTHA through Hardinge approach in patients with osteoarthritis was performed. We evaluated all patients clinically and radiologically with serial followups. A clinical hip score based upon the modified Harris Hip Score (MHHS) was performed preoperatively and again postoperatively. During the period of study 89 men (60.5%) and 58 women (39.4%) with a mean age of 54.67±7.08 years at the time of presentation were recruited. The mean surgical time was 2.8±0.25 hrs. The mean hospital stay was 3.83±0.65 days. Hemoglobin level decreased significantly after operation (P=0.038). There was two deep venous thromboses, one superficial infection and one temporal proneal palsy but no pulmonary embolism, dislocation, periprosthetic fracture or heterotrophic ossification. The mean preoperative MHHS score was 41.64±5.42 in patients. MHHS score improved to 89.26±4.68 in the last followup (P=0.0001). Our results recommended the use of cementless one-stage BTHA through Hardinge approach in patients with bilateral hip osteoarthritis.
