Germination is one of the most effective processes to improve the quality of legumes. Vitamins and some other compounds that might be considered beneficial as antioxidants, often change dramatically during the course of germination. Antioxidants might be defined as compounds which are capable of preventing, delaying or retarding the development of rancidity or other flavor deterioration in foods or as protective factors against the oxidative damage in the human body. In this research, three different solvents were employed to extract the phenolic compounds present in chickpea seeds and sprouts. Total phenolic contents were measured by Folin Ciocalteau method and the antioxidant activity was determined by two different methods including the assay of hydroxyl radical scavenging activity and the oven test method. For the later, different concentrations of extracts (0.02, 0.04, 0.06, 0.08 and 0.1% w/w) were added to tallow and the stabilities of the treatments were determined. Peroxide value and induction period measurements were used as means to evaluate the antioxidant activities. The results indicated that germination process modifies the antioxidant activity. Although the amount of phenolic compounds was higher when acetone solvent was employed, methanolic extract indicated better hydroxyl radical scavenging activity. The evaluation of the antioxidant activity of the extracts activity was concentration-dependent by delaying the indicated oxidation and increased when higher concentrations of the extracts were applied. Therefore, chickpea sprout flour or extract might be used as a source of natural antioxidants in functional foods or in the formulation of the oil-based supplements or medicine in the form of capsule.
