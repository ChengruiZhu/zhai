The prevalence of coronary heart disease events was 20.7% in Asian, 13.2% in Caucasian and 7.7% in Afro-Caribbean patients. Asian patients were younger at diagnosis of diabetes (−5.1 years p < 0.001 versus Afro-Caribbeans and −7.1 years p < 0.001 versus Caucasians). The mean number of events was highest amongst Asian (1.2) compared to Caucasian (1.1) and Afro-Caribbean (1.0) patients (p = 0.04). The mean age at first event was 61.3 years for Asians, 62.5 years and 65.8 for Afro-Caribbeans and Caucasians, respectively (analysis of variance F[2,131] = 2.36 p = 0.09). Un-adjusted odds ratios for at least one coronary heart disease event were highest among Asian men (OR 5.04; 95% CI 2.31–11.01; p < 0.0001) with Afro-Caribbean women as baseline (OR 1.0). The odds ratios remain largely unchanged (1.0 Afro-Caribbeans [baseline], 1.27 [p = 0.56] Caucasians and 3.2 [p = 0.001] for Asians) when corrected for age, gender, duration of diabetes, insulin dependency, mean low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol, triglycerides and high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol, mean glycated haemoglobin, mean systolic and diastolic blood pressure (logistic regression; ROC: 79% AUC). Afro-Caribbean patients had the highest mean high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (1.6 mmol/L) and the lowest risk for coronary heart disease events.
