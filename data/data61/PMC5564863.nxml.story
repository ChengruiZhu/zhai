Experimental laboratory study in nine fresh-frozen human cadaveric knees (mean age 46.3 years, range 41-50; 5 female). None had cartilage, ligament or meniscal lesions as evaluated by XR and MRI exam. Fresh-frozen, size- and side-matched medial meniscus allografts were obtained based on XR measurements (Pollard method). The knees were secured in a load apparatus where rotation, flexion, extension and tilt were adjusted to ensure correct knee alignment during loading. The tibiofemoral joint surface was oriented parallel to the floor while the femur was placed in three positions: 0, 30 and 60 degrees. A 700N load was applied axially through the knee. Mean and Peak Contact Pressure and contact area were measured with an I-scan pressure sensor-4011 (Tekscan, Boston / MA) placed underneath the medial meniscus through a small capsular incision. The same protocol was applied for each condition: native meniscus, meniscectomy, meniscal allograft transplantation with bone plug (MAT-bone) and with suture-only fixation (MAT-suture). Two measurements were taken under each testing condition. Meniscus transplants were first secured with bone plugs and capsular sutures, and measurements taken. Then, the bone plugs were carefully removed from the meniscal roots and the recipient slots in the tibial plateau filled with cement. The roots were then re-secured with trans-tibial suture-only fixation. The results of mean and peak contact stress and contact area were compared between intact, meniscectomized, MAT-bone and MAT-suture using analysis of variance (ANOVA). The level of significance was set at lower than p0.05.
