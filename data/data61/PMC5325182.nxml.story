Earthquakes, gene regulatory elements, financial transactions, and action potentials produced by nerve cells are examples of sequences of discrete events in space or time. In many cases, such events do not appear independently of each other. Instead, the occurrence of one event changes the rate of upcoming events (e.g, aftershocks following an earthquake). The nonlinear Hawkes process is a statistical model that captures these complex dependencies. Unfortunately, for a given model, it is hard to predict whether stochastic samples will produce an event pattern consistent with observations. In particular, with positive feedback loops, the process might diverge and yield unrealistically high event rates. Here, we show that an approximation to the mathematical model predicts dynamical properties, in particular, whether the model will exhibit stable and finite rates. In the context of neurophysiology, we find that models estimated from experimental data often tend to show metastability or even unstable dynamics. Our framework can be used to add constraints to data-driven estimation procedures to find the optimal model with realistic event rates and help to build more robust models of single-cell spiking dynamics. It is a first step towards studying the stability of large-scale nonlinear spiking neural network models estimated from data.
