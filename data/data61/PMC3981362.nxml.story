Intraventricular rupture of a brain abscess is still associated with a high mortality rate. Here, we report such a case in a patient with normal immunity that was treated successfully using neuroendoscopic approach. A 69-year-old man who had presented with headache and fever developed confusion and restlessness. Magnetic resonance imaging revealed a mass with ring enhancement extending to the right ventricle. Emergency aspiration of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) from the spinal canal revealed severe purulent meningitis. Bacterial culture of the CSF and blood was negative. Because of prolonged consciousness disturbance, the patient underwent evacuation of the intraventrcular abscess using a neuroendoscope. The pus was centrifuged and collected for bacterial culture, and this revealed Streptococcus intermedius/milleri. After implantation of a ventricular catheter, gentamicin sulfate was administered twice a day for 9 days. Cefotaxime sodium was also administered intravenously for 14 days, followed by oral administration of cefcapene pivoxil hydrochloride for 10 days. The patient made a complete recovery, and was discharged 31 days after admission. After 20 months of follow-up, he is doing well and has returned to his work. In cases of intraventricular rupture of a brain abscess, a neuroendoscopic approach is useful for evacuation of intraventricular debris or septum, and identification of the causative bacterium for selection of antibiotics, possibly reducing the period of hospitalization.
