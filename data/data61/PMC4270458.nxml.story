A neuron, as a fundamental unit of brain computation, exhibits extraordinary computational power in processing input signals from neighboring neurons. It usually integrates thousands of synaptic inputs from its dendrites to achieve information processing. This process is known as dendritic integration. To elucidate information coding, it is important to investigate quantitative spatiotemporal dendritic integration rules. However, there has yet to be extensive experimental investigations to quantitatively describe dendritic integration. Meanwhile, most theoretical neuron models considering time-dependent synaptic inputs are difficult to solve analytically, thus impossible to be used to quantify dendritic integration. In this work, we develop a mathematical method to analytically solve a two-compartment neuron model with time-dependent synaptic inputs. Using these solutions, we derive a quantitative rule to capture the dendritic integration of all types, including excitation-inhibition, excitation-excitation, inhibition-inhibition, and multiple excitatory and inhibitory inputs. We then validate our dendritic integration rule through both realistic neuron modeling and electrophysiological experiments. We conclude that the general spatiotemporal dendritic integration structure can be well characterized by our dendritic integration rule. We finally demonstrate that the rule leads to a graph representation of dendritic integration that exhibits functionally sparse properties.
