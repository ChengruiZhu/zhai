Whenever two residues are in close contact in the structure of a protein, their interaction will often constrain which amino acid substitutions can occur without perturbing the functionality of the protein, leading to “co-evolution” of the residues. With the large amount of data currently available, deep multiple alignments can be constructed of protein sequences that likely fold into a common structure, and several methods have been proposed for predicting contacting residues from statistical dependencies exhibited by pairs of alignment columns. Unfortunately, strong statistical dependencies are also observed between many pairs of residues that are distal in the structure. Through a comprehensive analysis of 2009 protein domains, we show that a large fraction of these distal dependencies are indirect and result from chains of contacting pairs that percolate through the protein. We present a Bayesian network model that rigorously disentangles direct from indirect dependencies and show that this greatly improves contact prediction. Additionally, we develop an informative prior that takes into account that the probability for residues to be in contact depends on their primary sequence separation, and that highly conserved residues tend to participate in a larger number of contacts. With this prior, the accuracy of the contact predictions is dramatically improved.
