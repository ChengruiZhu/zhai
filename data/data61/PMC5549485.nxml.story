Pancreaticoduodenal artery aneurysms (PDA) are rare visceral aneurysms. Celiac trunk stenosis represents a common attributable aetiology for those aneurysms. Therefore, an alternative treatment approach, which differs from those isolated aneurysms, is recommended. We hereby present a 77-year-old male patient who was admitted with sudden onset of severe abdominal pain and significant drop in haemoglobin, occurring within a 24-hour interval. Contrast-enhanced computed tomography revealed a ruptured visceral aneurysm arising from the anterior branch of the inferior pancreaticoduodenal artery. A severe stenosis was also noted at the take-off of the celiac trunk. Selective catheterization of the supplying branch of the superior mesenteric artery, followed by coil embolization of the aneurysm, was performed, resulting in cessation of flow within the aneurysm, with preservation of the posterior branch, supplying the celiac territory. PDAs are usually asymptomatic and discovered incidentally at rupture. The risk of rupture is independent of the aneurysmal size and is associated with a 50% mortality rate. The consensus on coping with aneurysms is to treat them whenever they are discovered. Selective angiography followed by coil embolization represents a less invasive, and frequently definitive, approach than surgery. The risk for ischemia mandates that the celiac territory must not be compromised after embolization.
