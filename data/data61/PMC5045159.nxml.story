The occurrence of large inclusions of aggregated amyloidogenic proteins is a hallmark of several neurodegenerative diseases. The most toxic species are believed to represent smaller units such as oligomers, whereas larger amyloid depositions are viewed rather cell protective. Therefore, it is important to understand how a cell recognizes and directs misfolded amyloidogenic proteins to specialized deposition sites for sequestration. We used yeast to reveal the mechanism of recruitment of a model amyloid to a specific amyloid deposition site termed IPOD. We found that during their recruitment to the IPOD, amyloid aggregates are linked to transport vesicles that are known to deliver completely unrelated substrates, namely vacuolar peptidase precursors, to a cellular site that is adjacent to the IPOD and is termed Phagophore Assembly Site (PAS) where the cell initiates autophagy. We further characterized this shared recruitment machinery and found strong evidence that it contains vesicular structures and requires a motor protein termed Myo2 that is known to transport vesicles along tropomyosin-coated actin cables. Deposition of PrD-GFP at the IPOD seems to serve more likely a temporary sequestration function when the aggregate load overwhelms downstream degradation pathways rather than an integrated step in the degradation of amyloid aggregates.
