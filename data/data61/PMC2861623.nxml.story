In post-mortem samples from 11 subjects, intestinal transporter distribution profiles were determined via Western Blot. Differences in transporter protein levels were statistically tested using ANOVA and Tukey's Post Hoc comparisons. Levels in all segments were expressed relative to those in duodenum. Except for ABCG5 and FATP4, levels (mean±SEM) were the highest in the ileum. For ABCA1, ileal levels (1.80±0.26) differed significantly from those in duodenum (P = 0.049) and proximal colon (0.92±0.14; P = 0.029). ABCG8 levels in ileum (1.91±0.30) differed from those in duodenum (P = 0.041) and distal colon (0.84±0.22; P = 0.010) and jejunum (1.64±0.26) tended to be higher than distal colon (0.84±0.22; P = 0.087). Ileal NPC1L1 levels (2.56±0.51) differed from duodenum levels (P = 0.019) and from distal colon (1.09±0.22; P = 0.030). There was also a trend (P = 0.098) for higher jejunal (2.23±0.37) than duodenal NPC1L1 levels. The levels of ABCG5 did not correlate with those of ABCG8. FAT/CD36 levels in ileum (2.03±0.42) differed from those in duodenum (P = 0.017), and proximal and distal colon (0.89±0.13 and 0.97±0.15 respectively; P = 0.011 and P = 0.014). FABPpm levels in ileum (1.04±0.13) differed from proximal (0.64±0.07; P = 0.026) and distal colon (0.66±0.09; P = 0.037).
