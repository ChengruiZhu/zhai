 The principles governing the passage of high frequency currents through various conductors have been discussed and exemplified in experiments done on both non-living and living bodies. In Part I it was shown: (1) That the current takes the path of least electrical resistance rather than the shortest path; (2) that maximal heating occurs at the point of greatest concentration of the lines of current flow. In a homogeneous medium with parallel electrodes maximal heat production occurs in those portions of the medium adjoining the electrodes and the heat gradient is from without inward. Under these circumstances maximal heating never occurs at the center. In discussing the localization of heat not only the electrical resistance and current concentration, but also the cooling effect, must be considered. In experiments on the dog's cadaver no evidence of the so called "skin effect" could be demonstrated. This is in contradistinction to the findings of Bettman and Crohn, but the discrepancy is explained on the basis of what we believe to be a technical error in their work. The finding of no "skin effect" is in agreement with the conclusions of Dowse and Iredell, based on both experimental and theoretical considerations. In Part II three types of experiments were performed on the anesthetized dog. The conclusions to be derived from them are these: (1) The heat gradient of the body is reversed during diathermy and heating occurs from without inward; (2) deep heating during diathermy is greater than that which results from the application of local heat to the skin; (3) the lung can be heated by diathermy in spite of simultaneous cooling of the chest wall. These experiments we regard as satisfactory evidence of the passage of the current through the interior of the body.
