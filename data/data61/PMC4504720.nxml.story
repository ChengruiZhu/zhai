In the reproductive cells of many eukaryotes, a process called meiosis generates haploid gametes. During meiosis, homologous parental chromosomes (homologs) recombine forming crossovers (CO) that provide genetic variation. CO formation generates physical links called chiasmata, which are essential for accurate homolog segregation. CO control designates a sub-set of recombination precursors that will mature to form at least one chiasma between each homolog pair. Recombination is accompanied by extensive chromosome reorganization. Formation of a proteinaceous axis organizes the pairs of sister chromatids of each homolog into conjoined linear looped chromatin arrays. Pairs of homologs then align and synapse becoming closely associated along their length by a protein structure, the synaptonemal complex (SC). The SC is disassembled at the end of prophase I and recombination is completed. We have investigated the link between recombination and chromosome remodelling by analysing the role of a protein, PCH2, which we show is required for remodelling of the chromosome axis during SC formation. In wild type, immunolocalization reveals depletion of the axis-associated signal of the axis component, ASY1, along synapsed regions of the chromosomes. In the absence of PCH2, the ASY1 signal is not depleted from the chromosome axis and the SC does not form normally. Although this defect in chromosome remodelling has no obvious effect on CO designation, CO maturation is perturbed such that the formation of at least one CO per homolog pair no longer occurs.
