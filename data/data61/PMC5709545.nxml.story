) molars were extracted, and rats were killed 7 or 14 days later. The maxillae were processed and subjected to histological and immunohistochemical assays. Hematoxylin-eosin staining (7th day) revealed inflammation in the CTL group that was partly reversed after DOX treatment. On the 14th day, the CTL group exhibited bone neoformation, conjunctive tissue, re-epithelization and the absence of inflammatory infiltrate. DOX-treated groups exhibited complete re-epithelization, tissue remodelling and almost no inflammation. Picrosirius red staining in the DOX10 group (7th and 14th days) revealed an increased percentage of type I and III collagen fibres compared with the CTL and DOX25 groups. The DOX10 and DOX25 groups exhibited increases in osteoblasts on the 7th and 14th days. However, there were fewer osteoclasts in the DOX10 and DOX25 groups on the 7th and 14th days. Wnt-10b-immunopositive cells increased by 130% and 150% on the 7th and 14th days, respectively, in DOX-treated groups compared with the CTL group. On the 7th day, Dickkopf (Dkk)-1 immunostaining was decreased by 63% and 46% in the DOX10 and DOX25 groups, respectively. On the 14th day, 69% and 42% decreases in immunopositive cells were observed in the DOX10 and DOX25 groups, respectively, compared with the CTL group. By increasing osteoblasts, decreasing osteoclasts, activating Wnt 10b and neutralising Dkk, DOX is a potential candidate for bone repair in periodontal diseases.
