Cushing's disease (CD) is remarkably prevalent among females; however, more severe clinical presentation and adverse outcomes have been found in males. The purpose of this study was to investigate the overall clinical profile and biochemical parameters in patients with CD to identify the gender differences. Here we describe our series of CD patients referred to our medical center during 2012-2013. Among 73 cases, females presented a marked preponderance compared to males. Males had significantly higher ACTH, BMI, HbA1c, systolic blood pressure, and hemoglobin than females. For the first time, the incidence of fatty liver and hepatic function was also shown to be elevated in males. Multiple linear regression analysis was performed to further investigate the correlation of risk factors with hypokalemia, HbA1c, and systolic blood pressure. Gender and serum cortisol were associated with hypokalemia. Age, gender, and serum cortisol were significantly associated with HbA1c. Additionally, only gender was significantly associated with systolic blood pressure. Regarding clinical presentation, purple striae seemed to occur more frequently in males than in females. Thus, more severe clinical presentation, biochemical parameters, and complications were found in males than in females. Clinical professionals should pay more attention to the diagnosis and management of males with CD.
