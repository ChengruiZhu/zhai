This consensus document is based on the guidelines related to the management of Non Hodgkin's Lymphoma (High grade) in the Indian population as proposed by the core expert committee. Accurate diagnosis in hematolymphoid neoplasm requires a combination of detailed history,clinical examination, and various investigations including routine laboratory tests, good quality histology section (of tumor and also bone marrow aspirate/biopsy), immunostaining, cytogenetic and molecular studies and radiology investigations. The staging system used for adult high grade lymphomas is based on the Ann Arbor system and includes various parameters like clinical, haematology, biochemistry, serology and radiology. Response should be evaluated with radiological evaluation after 3-4 cycles and at the end of treatment based on criteria including and excluding PET. Treatment of high grade lymphomas is based on histologic subtype, extent of disease, and age of the patient. Autologous stem cell transplantation after high dose chemotherapy is effective in the treatment of relapsed NHL. Newer RT techniques like 3 dimensional conformal radiation therapy (3D-CRT) and intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) can significantly reduce radiation doses to surrounding normal tissues in lymphoma patients. Patients should be followed up every 3 to 4 months for the first 2 years, followed by 6 monthly for the next 3 years and then annually.
