Krüppel-like factor 7 (KLF7) is a member of the KLF family of zinc finger transcription factors, and was the first KLF cloned using complementary DNA and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) techniques with human vascular endothelial cells as a template. In addition, KLF7 is known as the ubiquitous Krüppel-like factor, as it is widely expressed in numerous human tissues at low levels. In the present study, the function of KLF7 in migration and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), which are associated with tumor progression, was investigated in human oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) cells. Genes that were differentially expressed in normal vs. OSCC tissue were identified in the Gene Expression Omnibus database, which identified upregulation of KLF7 in OSCC. The expression and subcellular location of KLF7 was then analyzed using immunohistochemistry. KLF7 expression was measured in three OSCC cell lines, and the two cell lines with the highest (HN13) and lowest (CAL27) KLF7 expression were selected for further analysis. Subsequently, HN13 cells with reduced KLF7 expression (sh-HN13) and CAL27 cells overexpressing KLF7 (OE-CAL27) were constructed. Transwell migration and wound healing assays were then used to analyze the migration of the cells. In addition, mRNA and protein expression levels of the EMT markers E-cadherin, N-cadherin, vimentin and snail were detected using reverse transcription-quantitative PCR and western blotting. KLF7 overexpression in OSCC was validated using tissue immunohistochemistry, which identified moderate to high cytoplasmic staining of KLF7 in OSCC cells. KLF7 knockdown and overexpression altered the migration ability of sh-HN13 and OE-CAL27 cells, which decreased and increased significantly respectively. Expression of E-cadherin, N-cadherin, vimentin and snail was markedly altered in sh-HN13 and OE-CAL27 cells, indicating changes in EMT status. The results of the present study suggest that KLF7 overexpression changes the migratory behavior of OSCC cells, and induces EMT and lymph node metastasis through the expression of snail.
