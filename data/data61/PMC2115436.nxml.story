Reducing the internal pH of cultured cells by several different protocols that block endocytosis is found to alter the structure of clathrin lattices on the inside of the plasma membrane. Lattices curve inward until they become almost spherical yet remain stubbornly attached to the membrane. Also, the lattices bloom empty "microcages" of clathrin around their edges. Correspondingly, broken-open cells bathed in acidified media demonstrate similar changes in clathrin lattices. Acidification accentuates the normal tendency of lattices to round up in vitro and also stimulates them to nucleate microcage formation from pure solutions of clathrin. On the other hand, several conditions that also inhibit endocytosis have been found to create, instead of unusually curved clathrin lattices with extraneous microcages, a preponderance of unusually flat lattices. These treatments include pH-"clamping" cells at neutrality with nigericin, swelling cells with hypotonic media, and sticking cells to the surface of a culture dish with soluble polylysine. Again, the unusually flat lattices in such cells display a tendency to round up and to nucleate clathrin microcage formation during subsequent in vitro acidification. This indicates that regardless of the initial curvature of clathrin lattices, they all display an ability to grow and increase their curvature in vitro, and this is enhanced by lowering ambient pH. Possibly, clathrin lattice growth and curvature in vivo may also be stimulated by a local drop in pH around clusters of membrane receptors.
