Monitoring an athlete’s energy intake and energy expenditure (EE) is an important consideration of nutritional planning for sport conditioning and peak performance. In order to provide appropriate recommendations regarding nutritional requirements and caloric needs, an accurate determination of energy requirements is necessary. By knowing an individual’s EE, a coach, athletic performance staff or trainer can effectively determine training loads and volumes necessary for periodization and seasonal planning for a particular sport. The purpose of this study is to examine the accuracy of the BodyMedia Mini armband while measuring EE in female basketball players during various-intensity game-like conditions. This investigation required three testing sessions: an orientation session, and two randomized experimental trials. Trials included a maximal multistage 20-m shuttle run (Trial I) and 30-minute basketball skills session (Trial II). The independent variable for this investigation was EE estimated by the Mini armband. The dependent variable was EE determined by the Cosmed K4b2 indirect calorimetry (IC) method. EE assessed with the Mini and EE measured with the IC method was significantly correlated for both Trial I (r= 0.839) and Trial II (r= 0.833). EE calculated by the Mini was significantly underestimated in both Trial I (9.41 ± 26.1 total kcals) and Trial II (56.71 ± 14.1 total kcals). During Trial I the underestimation of EE increased with a rise in test level and intensity (p<.05). Due to the underestimation of EE by the Mini, the development of exercise specific algorithms to improve the estimation of EE during intermittent exercise in basketball players is warranted.
