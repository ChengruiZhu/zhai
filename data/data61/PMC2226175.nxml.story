 Sodium transport and oxygen consumption have been simultaneously studied in the short-circuited toad skin. A constant stoichiometric ratio was observed in each skin under control condition (NaCl-Ringer's solution bathing both sides of the skin) and after block of sodium transport by ouabain. During alterations of sodium transport by removal and addition of K to the internal solution the stoichiometric ratio is constant although having a value higher than that observed in other untreated skins. The coupling between active sodium transport and oxygen consumption was studied after a theoretical nonequilibrium thermodynamic model. Studies were made of the influence of Na chemical potential difference across the skin on the rates of Na transport and oxygen consumption. A linear relationship was observed between the rates of Na transport and oxygen consumption and the Na chemical potential difference. Assuming the Onsager relationship to be valid, the three phenomenological coefficients which describe the system were evaluated. Transient increases in the rate of sodium transport and oxygen consumption were observed after a transitory block of sodium transport by removal of Na from the external solution. Cyanide blocks completely the rate of oxygen consumption in less than 2 min and the short-circuit current measured after that time decays exponentially with time, suggesting a depletion of ATP from a single compartment.
