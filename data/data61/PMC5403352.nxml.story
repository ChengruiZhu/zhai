The endoplasmic reticulum stress inositol-requiring enzyme (IRE) 1α/X-box binding protein (XBP) 1 signaling pathway is involved in the tumorigenesis of breast and prostate cancer. Mucin 2 (MUC2) protects colon tissues from the formation of tumors. In human colorectal cancer (CRC) the role of IRE1α, and its analogue, IRE1β, has yet to be elucidated. In the present study, the expression levels of IRE1α, IRE1β, un-spliced XBP1u, spliced XBP1s and MUC2 in surgically resected cancerous and adjacent non-cancerous tissues from patients with CRC were investigated. The IRE1α, IRE1β, XBP1u, XBP1s and MUC2 mRNA expression levels were determined using reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction, and the protein expression levels were detected using immunohistochemistry and western blotting. The association between the expression levels of IRE1α, IRE1β and MUC2 and the clinicopathological features of patients with CRC was subsequently analyzed. The mRNA expression levels of IRE1β and MUC2 were decreased by ~2.1 and ~4.5-fold in CRC tissues, respectively, as compared with the adjacent normal tissues. The protein expression levels of IRE1β and MUC2 were decreased by ~8.0 and ~2.0-fold in the CRC tissues, respectively. IRE1β mRNA expression levels were positively correlated with MUC2 mRNA expression levels. IRE1β expression levels were revealed to be significantly associated with lymph node metastasis, tumor stage and histological differentiation. However, IRE1α, XBP1u and XBP1s mRNA and IRE1α protein expression levels were not observed to significantly differ between cancerous tissues and the adjacent normal tissues. The results indicated that the expression of IRE1β, but not IRE1α, may protect colon tissue from developing CRC by inducing MUC2 expression. Therefore, decreased IRE1β expression levels may be associated with the development of CRC through the inhibition of MUC2 expression.
