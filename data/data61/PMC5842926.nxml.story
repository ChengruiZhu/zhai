Hypertension has been recognized as a major risk factor for cardiovascular disease. We aimed to analyze the current prevalence, awareness, treatment, and control of hypertension in northeast China. This cross-sectional survey adopted the multistage stratified random cluster sampling method to obtain a representative sample of adults aged 40 years or older in the general population of northeast China. Hypertension was defined as a systolic blood pressure (SBP) ≥ 140 mm Hg, or diastolic blood pressure (DBP) ≥ 90 mm Hg, or self-reported use of antihypertensive medications in the last 2 weeks irrespective of BP. Altogether 4052 participants were included with weighted prevalence of hypertension of 57.3%. Among them, 47.4% were aware of their condition; 78.8% took antihypertensive medication, but only 10.2% had their blood pressure controlled. Individuals who were overweight/obesity, with dyslipidemia, or diabetes were at a higher risk of hypertension; these people also more likely to be aware of their condition. Subjects with a personal history of stroke were more inclined to receive antihypertensive medication, but that did not necessarily translate to well-controlled hypertension. Moreover, dyslipidemia (OR = 0.600; 95% CI: 0.375, 0.960) were associated with poor hypertension control. Subjects using combination of antihypertensive medications (OR = 2.924; 95% CI: 1.606, 5.325) or with a family history of coronary heart disease were more likely to have their blood pressure controlled. Our study identified a high prevalence of hypertension in northeast China. Although awareness and treatment rates improved over the last decade, the control rate remained disproportionately and unacceptably low.
