Autologous fat grafting procedures in plastic surgery have been extensively used to reinforce soft tissue in congenital or acquired tissue impairments. With this background, the aim of this study is firstly to examine the impact of a selective centrifugation on existing adipose stem cells (ASCs) in terms of stemness profile maintenance and, secondly, to investigate the effect of restoring volume in reconstruction on patients affected by soft tissue damage. After centrifugation, the fat graft products were separated into two layers and subsequently examined in vitro for the expression of CD34, CD90, CD117, CD105, CD29, CD31, CD44, CD73, CD133, CD14 and CD45 markers by flow cytometry and gene expression analyses were performed for Sox2, WNT3A, END, CD44, FUT4, COLL1, CTNNB1, hbEGF, KRTLG, MMP2 and VIM genes. The results showed that in the middle-high density (MHD) layer there was a peak concentration of ASCs, compared to another layer obtained after centrifugation. Research carried out on patients under treatment for soft tissue regeneration using cells obtained from MHD layer selection will be fundamental in comparative analysis. These studies will lead to an adequate standardization of outcomes, provided that treatment is performed through cell selection. Therefore, a unique procedure in tissue reconstruction and regeneration through fat grafting is presented here.
