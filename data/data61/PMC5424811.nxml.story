During any type of binary data transmission, the occurrence of bit errors is an inevitable and frequent problem suffered. These errors, which have fatal effects on the correct logic computation, especially in sophisticated logic circuits, can be checked through insertion of a parity generator (pG) at the transmitting end and a parity checker (pC) at the receiving end. Herein, taking even pG/pC as a model device, we constructed the first DNA-based molecular parity generator/checker (pG/pC) for error detection through data transmission, on a universal single-strand platform according to solely DNA hybridization. Compared with previous pG/pC systems, the distinct advantage of this one is that it can present not only fluorescence signals but also visual outputs, which can be directly recognized by the naked eye, using DNA inputs modulated split-G-quadruplex and its DNAzyme as signal reporters, thus greatly extending its potential practical applications. More importantly, an “Output-Correction” function was introduced into the pC for the first time, in which all of the erroneous outputs can be adequately corrected to their normal states, guaranteeing the regular operation of subsequent logic devices. Furthermore, through negative logic conversion towards the constructed even pG/pC, the odd pG/pC with equal functions was obtained. Furthermore, this system can also execute multi-input triggered concatenated logic computations with dual output-modes, which largely fulfilled the requirements of complicated computing.
