A method utilizing thin-layer chromatography with a flame ionization detector (TLC-FID) was developed for assessing the stability of breeder’s oil seed samples based on the formation of polar compounds. The results showed a linear relationship between peroxide value (PV) and the content of polar material in the oxidized oil. Oil samples oxidized very readily on chromarods, even at low temperature, which is a particular advantage for antioxidant screening. At 45 °C, the oil oxidation rate was relatively low, but the relationship between the content of polar material and reaction time was linear. At 65 °C, if the content of polar material was below 50 %, the above relationship was still linear. At different temperatures, the action of tocopherol appeared to vary slightly. For example, at 65 °C, the oxidative stability of the oil sample was determined by the content of tocopherol, especially γ-tocopherol. At 45 and 55 °C, the oxidative stability was determined by both the content of tocopherol and polyunsaturated fatty acids. Of the tocopherol isomers, γ-tocopherol exhibited the highest antioxidant potency, consistent with the published literature. These results suggest that chromarods provide good media for monitoring oil oxidation for antioxidant screening. A particular advantage is the use of very small oil samples, usually 1–2 μL, and the ability to analyze multiple samples at the same time.
