There has been no previous population-based study reporting the prevalence and risk factors of male lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) among men in mainland China. This cross-sectional study was conducted from 2013 to 2014 in three representative provinces of China: Guangdong, Hubei and Jiangsu. 3250 individuals participated in the interviews, which involved a questionnaire covering sociodemographic characteristics, lifestyle, dietary patterns and the International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS). Blood was collected for lipids, glucose, insulin and reproductive hormone tests. The incidences of LUTS and its obstructive and irritative symptoms were calculated. Risk factors for LUTS were identified using multivariable logistic regression analysis. The prevalence of moderate to severe LUTS and its obstructive and irritative symptoms was 14.3%, 13.1% and 16.1%, respectively, and increased with age. The prevalence in Guangdong was much lower than that in Hubei and Jiangsu in different ages. Increased fasting plasma glucose and decreased HDL-C levels were associated with an increased risk of moderate to severe LUTS (OR = 1.30, 95% CI: 1.02–1.65 and OR = 2.06, 95% CI: 1.08–3.94, respectively). Free testosterone < 0.22 ng/ml decreased the risk of moderate to severe LUTS and obstructive and irritative symptoms by about 20–30%. An inadequate daily intake of vegetables, fruit and water significantly increased the risk of LUTS by 1.3–to 2.0 times. In conclusion, the prevalence of LUTS in Chinese men is high and increases with age. Dietary patterns may be critical for the development of LUTS. Thus, dietary modifications could be a useful strategy for preventing the development of LUTS.
