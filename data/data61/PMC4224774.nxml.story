Fifty-eight patients have been included; 79% male, median age 48 y.o.; 38% were IL28B rs12979860 genotype CT or TT, 58.6% of patients presented cirrhosis and 24.1% presented fibrosis F3. Infection with genotype 1a was observed in 53.4% of patients. Median baseline HCV-RNA was 3,282,263 IU/mL (77.5% had >800,000 IU/mL). The most commonly used antiretroviral (ARV) drugs were tenofovir/emtricitabine [36 (62%) patients], etravirine [21 (36%) patients], abacavir/lamivudine [18 (31%) patients], boosted protease inhibitors [16 (27.5%) patients] and raltegravir [12 (20.6%) patients]. Of the 42 (72.4%) patients who had received previous HCV treatment, 13.7% were null responders, 25.8% were partial responders and 31% had relapsed. In an ITT approach, proportions of patients with undetectable HCV RNA were 67.8% (38/56) at TW4, 83.3% (40/48) at TW12, 80% (36/45) at TW24, 79.4% at TW36 (31/39) and 72% (26/36) at TW48. Fifteen (25.8%) patients discontinued HCV therapy [8 (13.8%) because they fulfilled stopping rules, 5 (8.6%) individuals due to adverse events and 2 (3.4%) were lost to follow-up]. Rash associated with TVR (grade 1) was observed in two cases (3.4%) and all the patients showed anaemia at some point of treatment. In an analysis by ITT in the 31 patients who had a 60 week follow-up after starting therapy, SVR-12 was observed in 21 (67.7%) patients. And in the analysis by ITT in 28 patients who had a 72 week follow-up after starting therapy, SVR-24 was observed in 17 (60.7%) patients.
