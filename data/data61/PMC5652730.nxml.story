The two estrogen receptor (ER) subtypes, ERα and ERβ, belong to the nuclear receptor superfamily. The human ERβ variant ERβ2 is proposed to be expressed at higher levels than ERβ1 in many breast tumors and it has been suggested that ERβ2, in contrast to ERβ1, is associated with aggressive phenotypes of various cancers. However, the role of endogenous ERβ2 in breast cancer cells remains elusive. In this study, we identified that triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) cell lines express endogenous ERβ2, but not ERα or ERβ1. This allows novel studies of endogenous ERβ2 functions independent of ERα and ERβ1. We show that overexpression of ERβ2 in TNBC cells increased whereas knockdown of endogenous ERβ2 decreased cell proliferation and cell invasion. To elucidate the molecular mechanism responsible for these cellular phenotypes, we assayed ERβ2 dependent global gene expression profiles. We show that ERβ2 decreases prolyl hydroxylase 3 (PHD3) gene expression and further show that this is associated with increased hypoxia inducible factor 1α (HIF-1α) protein levels, thus providing a possible mechanism for the invasive phenotype. These results are further supported by analysing the expression of ERβ2 and PHD3 in breast tumor samples where a negative correlation between ERβ2 and PHD3 expression was observed. Together, we demonstrate that ERβ2 has an important role in enhancing cell proliferation and invasion, beyond modulation of ERβ and ERβ1 signalling which might contribute to the invasive characteristics of TNBC. The invasive phenotype could potentially be mediated through transcriptional repression of PHD3 and increased HIF-1α protein levels.
