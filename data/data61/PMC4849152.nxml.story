Altered hepatic lipogenesis is associated with metabolic diseases such as obesity and hepatosteatosis. Insulin resistance and compensatory hyperinsulinaemia are key drivers of these metabolic imbalances. Fas apoptosis inhibitory molecule (FAIM), a ubiquitously expressed antiapoptotic protein, functions as a mediator of Akt signalling. Since Akt acts at a nodal point in insulin signalling, we hypothesize that FAIM may be involved in energy metabolism. In the current study, C57BL/6 wild-type (WT) and FAIM-knockout (FAIM-KO) male mice were fed with normal chow diet and body weight changes were monitored. Energy expenditure, substrate utilization and physical activities were analysed using a metabolic cage. Liver, pancreas and adipose tissue were subjected to histological examination. Serum glucose and insulin levels and lipid profiles were determined by biochemical assays. Changes in components of the insulin signalling pathway in FAIM-KO mice were examined by immunoblots. We found that FAIM-KO mice developed spontaneous non-hyperphagic obesity accompanied by hepatosteatosis, adipocyte hypertrophy, dyslipidaemia, hyperglycaemia and hyperinsulinaemia. In FAIM-KO liver, lipogenesis was elevated as indicated by increased fatty acid synthesis and SREBP-1 and SREBP-2 activation. Notably, protein expression of insulin receptor beta was markedly reduced in insulin target organs of FAIM-KO mice. Akt phosphorylation was also lower in FAIM-KO liver and adipose tissue as compared with WT controls. In addition, phosphorylation of insulin receptor substrate-1 and Akt2 in response to insulin treatment in isolated FAIM-KO hepatocytes was also markedly attenuated. Altogether, our data indicate that FAIM is a novel regulator of insulin signalling and plays an essential role in energy homoeostasis. These findings may shed light on the pathogenesis of obesity and hepatosteatosis.
