One of the many roles of a toxicologist is to determine if an observed adverse event (AE) is related to a previously unrecognized function of a given gene/protein. Towards that end, he or she will search a variety of public and propriety databases for information linking that protein to the observed AE. However, these databases tend to present all available information about a protein, which can be overwhelming, limiting the ability to find information about the specific toxicity being investigated. ToxReporter compiles information from a broad selection of resources and limits display of the information to user-selected areas of interest. ToxReporter is a PERL-based web-application which utilizes a MySQL database to streamline this process by categorizing public and proprietary domain-derived information into predefined safety categories according to a customizable lexicon. Users can view gene information that is ‘red-flagged’ according to the safety issue under investigation. ToxReporter also uses a scoring system based on relative counts of the red-flags to rank all genes for the amount of information pertaining to each safety issue and to display their scored ranking as an easily interpretable ‘Tox-At-A-Glance’ chart. Although ToxReporter was originally developed to display safety information, its flexible design could easily be adapted to display disease information as well.
