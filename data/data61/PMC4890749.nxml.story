Ligand interactions with proteins result in broad changes that are propagated throughout the target proteins, across space and time. These changes can be broadly classified into: orthosteric effects at the ligand binding site and allosteric changes at distal sites. These allosteric changes are difficult to localize and distinguish from binding interactions. In this study, we describe the application of amide hydrogen/deuterium exchange mass-spectrometry (HDXMS) to differentiate between changes occurring at the binding site and at distal allosteric sites by combining HDXMS with X-ray crystallography. Every ligand or a fragment mediates distinct contacts and results in changes in deuterium uptake across the protein. By comparing with orthosteric structural information, it is possible to identify long-range changes (action at a distance) due to the ligands. An important application of HDXMS is that it can identify subtle changes in protein dynamics that cannot be picked up by quantitative screens of protein-ligand interactions or crystal structures. This gives us the ability to describe ligand binding based on the response from different regions in the proteins. Thus it provides us with the potential to accurately measure and compare changes in dynamics upon binding different ligands and fragments, which is greatly valuable in fragment-based ligand design.
