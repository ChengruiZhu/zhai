This study aimed at providing a gauge device (Ekontak et al Gauge K-Device) in order to analyze the forces applied to teeth and periodontal tissues during dental practices in vitro. This force gauge device can be used in the investigation of the possible defect generation to tooth structures when overloaded forces are applied during dental procedures in vitro. Ekontak et al Gauge K-Device consists of three units: the specimen’s holder, a high-performance digital force gauge, and the support frame. The holder was fabricated by an Al alloy providing a steady detachable attachment between the specimens and the force gauge’s pin connector. The clinical simulation was achieved with the use of a proper silicone material, selected to provide similar elastic behavior with the human periodontal ligament and to join the teeth inside a solid matrix of an acrylic resin. The digital force gauge is a high-speed collection and recording (1000 Hz) product coupled with data recording software. The forces developed to 15 specimens’ root canals during lateral condensation and vertical compaction of cold gutta-percha obturation procedures were monitored, saved as graphs, CSV, and excel files and presented over time. The forces developed during vertical compaction (mean maximum force per obturation circle = 13.22 N) were more excessive than those during lateral condensation (mean maximum force per obturation circle = 10.14 N). In conclusion, Ekontak et al Gauge K-Device is provided as a modern gauge device, capable of performing clinical simulation in vitro, under the terms of its protocol.
