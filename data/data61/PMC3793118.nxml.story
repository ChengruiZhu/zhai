For chronic sinusitis surgery, the Draf III approach provides a common median drainage pathway for bilateral frontal sinuses from orbit to orbit. The Draf IIb provides unilateral drainage from orbit to septum. In several cases, inclusion of the nasal and frontal sinus septum in a Draf IIb was advantageous without extension to the opposite frontal recess. The proposed nomenclature is Draf IIc. This study was designed to (1) develop a surgical option for chronic frontal sinusitis where access to one frontal recess is limited or unnecessary and (2) minimize unnecessary surgical manipulation of uninvolved areas. Revision endoscopic frontal sinus surgery was performed on two patients with persistent frontal sinus opacification. Surgery crossed midline including one frontal recess with resection of the superior nasal septum. The surgical result was assessed on endoscopy and computed tomography (CT). The postoperative course was unremarkable with relief of frontal pressure. Postoperative CT scan showed well-aerated frontal sinuses with a widely patent common drainage pathway. Postoperative nasal endoscopy revealed normal mucosa with no exposed bone or edema. The Draf IIc extends the Draf IIb across the midline, without including the opposite frontal recess. This can be accomplished most easily using an interfrontal sinus septal cell or an eccentric interfrontal sinus septum. The Draf IIc is a surgical option in cases of chronic or recalcitrant frontal sinus diseases, including unilateral or bilateral obstruction, where access to the ipsilateral frontal recess is limited or favorable anatomy allows drainage with reduced manipulation of an uninvolved side.
