Molecular connectivity maps between drugs and a wide range of bio-molecular entities can help researchers to study and compare the molecular therapeutic/toxicological profiles of many candidate drugs. Recent studies in this area have focused on linking drug molecules and genes in specific disease contexts using drug-perturbed gene expression experiments, which can be costly and time-consuming to derive. In this paper, we developed a computational framework to build disease-specific drug-protein connectivity maps, by mining molecular interaction networks and PubMed abstracts. Using Alzheimer's Disease (AD) as a case study, we described how drug-protein molecular connectivity maps can be constructed to overcome data coverage and noise issues inherent in automatically extracted results. We showed that this new approach outperformed both curated drug target databases and conventional text mining systems in retrieving disease-related drugs, with an overall balanced performance of sensitivity, specificity, and positive predictive values. The AD molecular connectivity map contained novel information on AD-related genes/proteins, AD candidate drugs, and protein therapeutic/toxicological profiles of all the AD candidate drugs. Bi-clustering of the molecular connectivity map revealed interesting patterns of functionally similar proteins and drugs, therefore creating new opportunities for future drug development applications.
