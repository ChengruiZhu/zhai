Purpose of the study was to retrospectively analyze the complication rates after operatively treated femoral shaft fractures in childhood and adolescence. Retrospective evaluation of 42 children with operatively treated femoral shaft fractures between 2000 and 2014. Fractures were classified as 27 A type, 12 B type and 3 C type fractures according the OTA/AO classification. 8 (19.05%) fractures were open. Age averaged 10.2 years (3-16). Fracture treatment was recorded as temporary or definitive external fixation, ESIN, plate fixation or IMN. Complications such as wound infection, re-fractures, nonunion and malunion were analyzed. Six (14.29%) fractures were temporarily stabilized using an external fixator. In 22 (52.38%) children the femoral shaft fracture was stabilized using ESINs. 10 (23.81%) children had a plate fixation and 9 (21.43%) adolescents were treated using an IMN. ESIN treated children were significantly younger (P=0.000) and had less weight (P=0.000) than children treated with both other methods. Complications were two (4.76%) superficial and two deep (4.76%) wound infections, one (2.38%) re-fracture with the ESIN in situ, one (2.38%) nonunion and one (2.38%) malunion. Six (14.29%) children required a reoperation for a complication. Risk factors for complications were temporarily applied external fixators, open fractures, C Type fractures (P=0.031) and an increasing age (P=0.048) and weight (P=0.047) of the child. The majority of children in our study population were successfully treated using ESIN presenting a low complication rate. Complications were observed following open fractures and more complex fracture types. Furthermore we observed an increasing complication rate with increasing ages and weights of the children.
