Diabetes was diagnosed in 1102 patients (36.5%). During the index hospitalization, coronary angioplasty and coronary thrombolysis were performed in 58.1% and 16.3% of patients, respectively. In-hospital mortality of diabetic patients with AMI was comparable to that of non-diabetic AMI patients (9.2% and 9.3%, respectively). In total, 2736 patients (90.6%) were discharged alive and followed for a median of 4.2 years (follow-up rate, 96.0%). The long-term survival rate was worse in the diabetic group than in the non-diabetic group, but not significantly different (hazard ratio, 1.20 [0.97-1.49], p = 0.09). On the other hand, AMI patients with diabetes showed a significantly higher incidence of cardiovascular events than the non-diabetic group (1.40 [1.20-1.64], p < 0.0001). Multivariate analysis revealed that three factors were significantly associated with favorable late outcomes in diabetic AMI patients: acute revascularization (HR, 0.62); prescribing aspirin (HR, 0.27); and prescribing renin-angiotensin system (RAS) inhibitors (HR, 0.53). There was no significant correlation between late outcome and prescription of beta-blockers (HR, 0.97) or calcium channel blockers (HR, 1.27). Although standard Japanese-approved doses of statins were associated with favorable outcome in AMI patients with diabetes, this was not statistically significant (0.67 [0.39-1.06], p = 0.11).
