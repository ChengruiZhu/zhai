 of animal origin, only three were capable of causing dissolution of clot. Completely negative results were obtained with 38 strains of other bacterial species. The list is presented on pages 492 and 493. The plasma of many patients recovered from acute hemolytic streptococcus infections, when clotted in the presence of active cultures, is highly resistant to fibrinolysis. Furthermore, serum, derived from patients whose plasma clot is resistant, often confers on normal plasma clot an antifibrinolytic property. One example of the resistance possessed by the blood of convalescent patients is presented in this report. A second paper, now in preparation, will give in detail a large number of observations on the relation of infection to the development of resistance to the fibrinolytic activity of hemolytic streptococci. In contrast to the susceptibility of normal human fibrin clot to liquefaction by active culture, normal rabbit fibrin clot is totally resistant to dissolution when tested under comparable conditions. The insusceptibility of rabbit fibrin clot is manifest provided the coagulum is composed of rabbit constituents. When human thrombin is used to clot rabbit plasma or fibrinogen in the presence of active cultures, fibrinolysis is not prohibited. The r√¥le of thrombin in determining the resistance or susceptibility of rabbit fibrin to dissolution offers a suggestive approach to problems relating to the underiving mechanism.
