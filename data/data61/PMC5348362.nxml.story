Resistance to epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) targeted monoclonal antibody therapy represents a clinical challenge in patients suffered from RAS wild-type (WT) metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC). However, the molecular mechanisms and key factors conferring this resistance are largely unknown. Forkhead transcription factors of the O class 3a (FoxO3a), an important regulator of cell survival, has been reported with dual functions in tumor recently. In this study, we found that FoxO3a was highly expressed in cetuximab resistant CRC tissues compared with cetuximab sensitive tissues. We therefore further analyzed its function in induced cetuximab resistant RAS-WT CRC cells (Caco2-CR) and intrinsic resistant cells with BRAF mutation (HT29). We found that FoxO3a was significantly up-regulated in Caco2-CR as well as in cetuximab treated HT29 cells. Knockdown of FoxO3a could sensitize these cells to cetuximab treatment with reduced cell proliferation and migration ability. Further, biochemical experiments demonstrated that FoxO3a directly bind to c-Myc promoter and activated the transcription of the c-Myc gene, thus participated in regulating of c-Myc downstream genes, including ACO2, LARS2, MRPL12 and PKM2 in these resistant cells. Moreover, knockdown of c-Myc elevated cell apoptosis to cetuximab treatment and suppressed cell proliferation and migration ability consistently. Altogether, our study indicates that FoxO3a might be a key regulator in cetuximab resistance through up-regulating c-Myc in colorectal cancer targeted therapy.
