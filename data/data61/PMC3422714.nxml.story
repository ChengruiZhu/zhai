Immune cells express toll-like receptors (TLRs) and respond to molecular patterns of various pathogens. CpG motif in bacterial DNA activates innate and acquired immune systems through binding to TLR9 of immune cells. Several studies reported that CpG can directly regulate B cell activation, differentiation, and Ig production. However, the role of CpG in B cell growth and Ig production is not fully understood. In this study, we analyzed the effect of CpG on the kinetics of mouse B cell viability, proliferation, and Igs production. Overall, CpG enhanced mouse B cell growth and production of Igs in a dose-dependent manner. Unlike LPS, 100 nM CpG (high dose) did not support TGF-β1-induced IgA and IgG2b production. Moreover, 100 nM CpG treatment abrogated either LPS-induced IgM or LPS/TGF-β1-induced IgA and IgG2b production, although B cell growth was enhanced by CpG under the same culture conditions. We subsequently found that 10 nM CpG (low dose) is sufficient for B cell growth. Again, 10 nM CpG did not support TGF-β1-induced IgA production but, interestingly enough, supported RA-induced IgA production. Further, 10 nM CpG, unlike 100 nM, neither abrogated the LPS/TGF-β1-nor the LPS/RA-induced IgA production. Taken together, these results suggest that dose of CpG is critical in B cell growth and Igs production and the optimal dose of CpG cooperates with LPS in B cell activation and differentiation toward Igs production.
