Several studies suggest an important role of Acyl-CoA: cholesterol acyltransferase-1(ACAT-1) in the development of atherosclerosis. The aim of present study was to investigate whether there exists a possible correlation between genetic variations in ACAT-1 genes and coronary artery disease (CAD) risk. Four polymorphisms (rs1044925, rs11545566, rs12121758 and rs10913733) were finally selected and genotyped in 750 CAD patients and 580 health controls, using the improved multiplex ligation detection reaction (iMLDR) method. We found that the rs11545566 G allele was associated with a significantly elevated CAD risk [GG vs. AA: adjusted odds ratio (AOR) = 1.62, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.13-2.32, P = 0.008; GA/GG vs. AA: AOR = 1.67, 95% CI = 1.22-2.29, P = 0.001]. The rs10913733 G allele was also associated with a significantly elevated CAD risk (GG vs. TT: AOR = 1.57, 95% CI = 1.08-2.28, P = 0.018; GT/GG vs. TT: AOR = 1.39, 95% CI = 1.07-1.79, P = 0.013). Multivariate linear regression analysis showed that the rs11545566 polymorphism was independently associated with the Gensini scores (P = 0.005). The Gensini score of subjects in the variant GG genotype group and the GG/GA genotype group were higher than the score of subjects in the AA genotype group (32.49 ± 26.60 and 31.26 ± 26.96 vs. 23.45 ± 21.64; P = 0.001 and 0.002, respectively). Our results demonstrate that ACAT-1 rs1154556 and rs10913733 polymorphism are novel genetic factors in the development of CAD. Rs11545566 was also associated with the severity of CAD.
