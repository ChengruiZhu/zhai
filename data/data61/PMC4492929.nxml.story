Developing methods for accurate prediction of effects of amino acid substitutions on protein-protein affinity is important for both understanding disease-causing mechanism of missense mutations and guiding protein engineering. For both purposes, there is a need for accurate methods primarily based on first principle calculations, while being fast enough to handle large number of cases. Here we report a new method, the Single Amino Acid Mutation based change in Binding free Energy (SAAMBE) method. The core of the SAAMBE method is a modified molecular mechanics Poisson-Boltzmann Surface Area (MM/PBSA) method with residue specific dielectric constant. Adopting residue specific dielectric constant allows for mimicking the effects of plausible conformational changes induced by the binding on the solvation energy without performing computationally expensive explicit modeling. This makes the SAAMBE algorithm fast, while still capable of capturing many of the explicit effects associated with the binding. The performance of the SAAMBE protocol was tested against experimentally determined binding free energy changes over 1300 mutations in 43 proteins and very good correlation coefficient was obtained. Due to its computational efficiency, the SAAMBE method will be soon implemented into webserver and made available to the computational community.
