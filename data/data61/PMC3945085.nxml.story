Understanding the transition to multicellularity remains a key unanswered question in evolutionary biology. The transition required three essential cellular features to evolve: adhesion, signaling and differentiation. In particular, cell differentiation requires sensitivity to environmental cues to create distinct cell-specific transcription profiles. Previous work with model organisms and gene network models showed that biological systems evolve robustness to both mutational and environmental perturbations under stabilizing selection and that furthermore, mutational and environmental robustness are correlated. Increased robustness to environmental cues will therefore pose a barrier to the development of cell differentiation, and thus multicellularity. Because several important epigenetic developmental mechanisms, particularly Polycomb-mediated histone modification, appear to have evolved with multicellularity, we hypothesized that such a mechanism facilitated sensitivity to the environment and therefore cell differentiation. Using a computational model, we integrated Polycomb function with a regulatory model, revealing a clear decoupling between environmental and mutational robustness, allowing increased environmental sensitivity while mutational robustness remained intact. We also found that Polycomb greatly facilitated the ability for a single gene network to create several distinct transcription profiles - each representing a distinct differentiated cell type. Our work highlights the simple elegance through which the evolution of a key epigenetic mechanism can facilitate the transition to functional cell differentiation.
