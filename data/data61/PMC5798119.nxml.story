Patients with developmental dysplasia of the hip (DDH) who undergo periacetabular osteotomy (PAO) often have labral tears. The objective of this retrospective study was to compare PAO alone with PAO combined with arthrotomy or arthroscopy in DDH patients who had a full-thickness labral tear on magnetic resonance imaging. In total, 47 hips in the PAO group (PAO) were compared with 60 hips in the PAO with concomitant arthrotomy or arthroscopy (PAO-A) with respect to Hip Disability and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (HOOS), modified Harris Hip Score (mHHS), Visual Analog Scale (VAS), clinical and radiographic outcomes at a median of 29 months. Reoperation rate and complications were compared between two groups of treatment. The PAO group was younger than the PAO-A group (25.2 ± 9.7 versus 31.3 ± 8.3). The PAO group was more likely to have worse dysplasia: lateral center edge angle (7.6°±9.63° versus 10.8°±6.85°) and anterior center edge angle (4°±12.92° versus 10.8°±9.92°). The PAO group had a higher preoperative mHHS (65.2 ± 15.3 versus 57.8 ± 14.8) and HOOS (66.3 ± 17.5 versus 55.8 ± 20.1). There were no significant differences in final functional outcome scores across treatment groups: mHHS (PAO; 86.8 ± 12.4 versus PAO-A, 83.3 ± 17.2), HOOS (86.5 ± 13.3 versus 82.5 ± 16.8) and VAS (2.5 ± 2.8 versus 2.5 ± 3.1). There was no difference in reoperation rate between two groups (6.4% versus 11.6%,
