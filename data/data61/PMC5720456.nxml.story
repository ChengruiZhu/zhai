, (ScandiDos, Uppsala, Sweden). This device consists of diode matrices in two orthogonal planes inserted in a cylindrical acrylic phantom that is 22 cm in diameter. Although the system has detectors in only two planes, it provides a novel interpolation algorithm that is capable of estimating doses at points where no detectors are present. Each diode is sampled per beam pulse so that the dose distribution can be evaluated on segment‐by‐segment, beam‐by‐beam, or as a composite plan from a single set of measurements. The end user can calibrate the system to perform absolute dosimetry, eliminating the need for additional ion chamber measurements. The patient's IMRT plan is imported into the device over the hospital LAN and the results of the measurements can be displayed as gamma profiles, distance‐to‐agreement maps, dose difference maps, or the measured dose distribution can be superimposed on the patient's anatomy to display an as‐delivered plan. We evaluated the system's reproducibility, stability, pulse‐rate dependence, dose‐rate dependence, angular dependence, linearity of dose response, and energy response using carefully planned measurements. We also validated the system's interpolation algorithm by measuring a complex dose distribution from an IMRT treatment. Several simple and complex isodose distributions planned using a treatment planning system were delivered to the QA device; the planned and measured dose distributions were then compared and analyzed. In addition, the dose distributions measured by conventional IMRT QA, which uses an ion chamber and film, were compared. We found that the Delta4 device is accurate and reproducible and that its interpolation algorithm is valid. In addition, the supplied software and network interface allow a streamlined IMRT QA process.
