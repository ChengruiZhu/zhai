Follicular dendritic cell (FDC)-sarcoma is a rare neoplasm with morphologic and phenotypic features of FDCs. It shows an extremely heterogeneous morphology, therefore, its diagnosis relys on the phenotype of tumor cells. Aim of the present study was the identification of new specific markers for FDC-sarcoma by whole transcriptome sequencing (WTS). Candidate markers were selected based on gene expression level and biological function. Immunohistochemistry was performed on reactive tonsils, on 22 cases of FDC-sarcomas and 214 control cases including 114 carcinomas, 87 soft tissue tumors, 5 melanomas, 5 thymomas and 3 interdigitating dendritic cell sarcomas. FDC secreted protein (FDCSP) and Serglycin (SRGN) proved to be specific markers of FDC and related tumor. They showed better specificity and sensitivity values than some well known markers used in FDC sarcoma diagnosis (specificity: 98.6%, and 100%, respectively; sensitivity: 72.73% and 68.18%, respectively). In our cohorts CXCL13, CD21, CD35, FDCSP and SRGN were the best markers for FDC-sarcoma diagnosis and could discriminate 21/22 FDC sarcomas from other mesenchymal tumors by linear discriminant analysis. In summary, by WTS we identified two novel FDC markers and by the analysis of a wide cohort of cases and controls we propose an efficient marker panel for the diagnosis of this rare and enigmatic tumor.
