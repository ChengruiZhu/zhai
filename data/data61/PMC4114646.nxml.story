At present, only eight cases of tracheal adenoid cystic carcinomas (ACCs) mimicking thyroid tumors have been reported. Since there are no guidelines available regarding their diagnosis and treatment, they present a significant clinical challenge. In the present study, patient treatment was analyzed to deliver the first concise summary of treatment options in patients with ACC mimicking a thyroid tumor. In addition, all available data regarding molecular abnormalities of this disease have been discussed. The current study presents a case of a 17-year-old patient with a tracheal ACC mimicking a thyroid tumor. The patient was diagnosed in 2007 with a pathological mass between the left lobe of the thyroid and the trachea, and underwent surgery and radiotherapy. In 2010, multiple lesions in the lungs were diagnosed and pulmonary metastasectomy was performed. Following surgery, the patient has been disease-free for almost 30 months. Thyroid tumor biopsy may reveal ACCs. This pathological report requires further investigation of the head and neck in order to confirm if the disease is of tracheal origin. Patients may present with a neck swelling, hoarseness of voice or dysphagia. Surgery must be considered as first-line therapy for all patients with local disease as it may be curative. For palliative treatment chemoradiotherapy based on cisplatin may be effective. The identification of cytogenetics, tumor suppressor genes, oncogenes, epigenetic alterations and mitochondrial abnormalities specific for ACCs is critical to the development of targeted therapies. Thus far, large studies have only reported the transcriptional activator Myb and mammalian target of rapamycin signaling pathway to be disrupted in ACCs.
