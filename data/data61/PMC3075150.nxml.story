Although complications including graft thrombosis, graft pancreatitis, and rejection have been well documented after pancreas transplantation, the occurrence of graft duodenal perforation is uncommon. In this article, we report a case of graft duodenal perforation due to internal hernia after simultaneous pancreas-kidney transplantation (SPK). A patient with type I diabetes mellitus and diabetic nephropathy had undergone SPK from a cadaveric donor. One year later, she was admitted to our hospital for severe lower abdominal pain with preshock status. She was immediately examined by abdominal computed tomography and both peripancreas graft fluid accumulation and severe dilatation of the ileum were detected. On emergency operation, two punched holes located at the graft duodenal side near the suture line and an obstruction of herniated bowel behind the graft pancreas were detected. These holes were repaired and the internal hernia was reduced. However, a control of the intraabdominal infection was very difficult despite intensive treatment with antibiotics and additional abdominal drainage. Finally, a graft pancreatectomy was unavoidably required. When complications, including symptomatic intraabdominal infection, require re-laparotomy after pancreas transplantation, the therapeutic focus should be switched from salvaging the graft to the preservation of life.
