Thymic peptides are immune regulators produced mainly in the thymus. However, thymic peptides such as thymosin-Î± and thymopoietin have precursors widely expressed outside the thymus, localized in cell nuclei, and involved in vital nuclear functions. In stress-related conditions, they can relocalize. We hypothesized that another thymic peptide, thymulin, could be similarly produced by non-thymic cells during stress and have a precursor therein. Non-thymic cells, including macrophages and fibroblasts, were exposed to oxidative stress, heat, apoptosis, or necrosis. Extracellular thymulin was identified in media of both cell types 2 h after exposure to stress or lethal signals. Therefore, thymulin is released by non-thymic cells. To examine possible thymulin precursors in non-thymic cells, macrophage lysates were analyzed by western blotting. Bands stained with anti-thymulin antibody were detected in two locations, approximately 60 kDa and 10 kDa, which may be a possible precursor and intermediate. All of the exposures except for heat were effective for induction of the 10 kDa protein. BLAST search using thymulin sequence identified SPATS2L, an intranucleolar stress-response protein with molecular weight of 62 kDa, containing thymulin-like sequence. Comparisons of blots stained with anti-thymulin and anti-SPATS2L antibodies indicate that SPATS2L may be a possible candidate for the precursor of thymulin.
