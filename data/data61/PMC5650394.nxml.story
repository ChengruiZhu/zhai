Neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) is one of the parameters of a complete blood cell count (CBC) test and has been reported to be an easily accessible prognostic marker in aggressive cancer, including non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL). Primary central nervous system lymphoma (PCNSL) is an extranodal NHL with highly aggressive features. However, the importance of the NLR has never been assessed in PCNSL. This retrospective study enrolled 62 biopsy-proven patients whose baseline NLR was available, and reviewed their medical records to compare both high (≥2.0) and low NLR (<2.0) groups, in terms of clinical characteristics and outcomes. The low NLR group showed significantly better response rates to induction chemotherapy compared to the high NLR group (p=0.041). At a median follow-up of 41.5 months, the high NLR group revealed a significantly worse 3-year overall survival (OS) (42.5 vs. 71.2%; p=0.031) and a worse 3-year progression-free survival (PFS) (37.3 vs. 60.1%; p=0.028). Univariable Cox analysis results showed that a high NLR at diagnosis was a poor prognostic factor for both 3-year OS (HR 2.64, 95% CI 1.06-6.60; p=0.038) and 3-year PFS (HR 2.41, 95% CI 1.07-5.42; p=0.034). However, multivariable analyses adjusting for International Extranodal Lymphoma Study Group (IELSG) score and induction chemotherapy regimen with rituximab, which were strongly prognostic in this study, showed no statistical significance even with the high NLR group’s tendency towards a worse 3-year OS (HR 2.36, 95% CI 0.84-6.62, p=0.102) and a worse 3-year PFS (HR 2.28, 95% CI 0.93-5.63, p=0.073). In conclusion, given that NLR is simple and easily obtainable, it might play a potentially prognostic role in PCNSL from early disease onset.
