 Miller juice (ABMJ) for thyroid-unrelated reasons, she noticed a decrease in serum thyroperoxidase autoantibodies (TPOAb) and thyrotropin (TSH) and an increase in serum free thyroxine (FT4). Based on this observation, we enrolled 30 consecutive HT women with levothyroxine-untreated SCH and high TPOAb levels. All of them took ABMJ (50 ml daily) for nine months and were tested for serum TSH, FT4, free triiodothyronine (FT3) and TPOAb. Measurements were performed at baseline and at months 3 and 9. TSH, FT4 and TPOAb improved significantly already at month 3 and further (−61%, +23% and −56%) at month 9. However, FT3 decreased significantly at month 3 (−16%) with no further decrease at month 9, so that the FT4:FT3 ratio increased significantly (+33% and + 49%). At baseline, 100% of women had TSH > 4.0 mU/L and TPOAb > 400 U/ml, but frequencies fell to 0% and 37%, respectively, at month 9. In contrast, a control group (namely, 15 untreated SCH women of comparable age and baseline levels of TSH, FT4, FT3 and TPOAb) had no significant changes in any index. We conclude that the daily intake of 100 ml ABMJ for 9 months in women with HT-related SCH decreases the burden of thyroid autoimmune inflammation. In addition, ABMJ rescues thyrocyte function, with decreased need for conversion of the prohormone T4 into the more active T3 through ABMJ-induced inhibition of T4 deiodination.
