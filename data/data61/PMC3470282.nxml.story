The use of mammography film-screen is limited in general radiography. The purpose of this study was to compare the effectiveness of mammographic film-screen and standard film-screen systems in the detection of small bone fractures. Radiographs were taken from patients' extremities and neck areas using mammography film-screen and standard film-screen (n=57 each). Fourteen other radiographs were taken from other views (predominantly oblique views), making a total number of 128 radiographs. Paired radiographs, taken from the same areas, were compared by two radiologists in terms of image visual sharpness, presence of bony fractures, and soft tissue injuries. The surface dose received by patients in the two systems was also compared. The radiographs taken by mammography film-screen had a statistically better visual sharpness compared to those taken by the standard film-screen system. However, there was no statistically significant difference between the diagnostic accuracy of the two systems. Mammography film-screen was able to detect only one out of 57 lesions, whereas standard film-screen system did not detec any lesion. The surface dose received by patients in mammography film-screen was higher than that in standard film-screen system. The findings of the present study suggest that mammography film-screen may be recommended as a diagnostic tool for the detection of small fractures of tinny parts of body such as fingers, hand or foot. They also suggest that mammography film-screen has no advantage over standard film-screen for radiography of thick body parts such as neck and knee.
