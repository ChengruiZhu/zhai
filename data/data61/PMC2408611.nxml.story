Skin cancers—the most commonly diagnosed cancers worldwide—are usually caused by exposure to ultraviolet (UV) radiation in sunlight. UV radiation damages the DNA in skin cells and can introduce permanent genetic changes (mutations) into the skin cells that allow them to divide uncontrollably to form a tumor, a disorganized mass of cells. Because there are many different cell types in the skin, there are many types of skin cancer. The most dangerous type—melanoma—develops when genetic changes occur in melanocytes, the cells that produce the skin pigment melanin. Although only 4% of skin cancers are melanomas, 80% of skin cancer deaths are caused by melanomas. The first signs of a melanoma are often a change in the appearance or size of a mole (a pigmented skin blemish that is also called a nevus) or a newly arising pigmented lesion that looks different from the other moles (an “ugly duckling”). If this early sign is noticed and the melanoma is diagnosed before it has spread from the skin into other parts of the body, surgery can sometimes provide a cure. But, for more advanced melanomas, the outlook is generally poor. Although radiation therapy, chemotherapy, or immunotherapy (drugs that stimulate the immune system to kill the cancer cells) can prolong the life expectancy of some patients, these treatments often fail to remove all of the cancer cells.
