Rapid and sensitive detection of botulinum neurotoxins (BoNTs), which cause botulism, is essential in a public health emergency or bioterrorism event. We have previously developed a mass spectrometry (MS)-based functional method, Endopep-MS assay, for the fast detection and differentiation of all BoNT serotypes by affinity enriching the toxin and detecting the serotype-specific cleavage products of peptide substrates derived from the in vivo targets. To improve the performance of the Endopep-MS assay, we report here the further optimization of the peptide substrate for the detection of serotype A botulinum neurotoxins. An increased substrate cleavage was achieved by extending the original peptide N-terminus with optimized amino acid sequence, increasing the detection sensitivity of the method. In addition, the resistance of the substrate to nonspecific hydrolysis was dramatically improved by selectively substituting amino acids at the scissile bond and various other positions of the extended peptide. Moreover, incorporating the N-terminal hydrophobic residues dramatically improved the relative intensity of the cleavage products in the mass spectra. This allowed easy detection of the cleavage products, further enhancing the performance of the assay. The limit of detection for spiked serum sample was enhanced from 0.5 to 0.1 mouseLD
