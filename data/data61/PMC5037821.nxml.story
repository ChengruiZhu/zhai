Enhanced cellular DNA repair efficiency and suppression of genomic instability have been proposed as mechanisms underlying radio-adaptive responses following low-dose radiation exposures. We previously showed that low-dose γ irradiation does not generate radio-adaptation by lowering radiation-induced cytogenetic damage in mouse spleen. Since radiation may exert tissue-specific effects, we extended these results here by examining the effects of γ radiation on cytogenetic damage and proliferative index in bone marrow erythrocytes of C57BL/6 and BALB/c mice. In C57BL/6 mice, the induction of micronuclei in polychromatic erythrocytes (MN-PCE) was observed at radiation doses of 100 mGy and greater, and suppression of erythroblast maturation occurred at doses of >500 mGy. A linear dose–response relationship for MN-PCE frequencies in C57BL/6 mice was established for radiation doses between 100 mGy and 1 Gy, with departure from linearity at doses of >1 Gy. BALB/c mice exhibited increased MN-PCE frequencies above baseline following a 20 mGy radiation exposure but did not exhibit radio-sensitivity relative to C57BL/6 mice following 2 Gy exposure. Radio-adaptation of bone marrow erythrocytes was not observed in either strain of mice exposed to low-dose priming γ irradiation (single doses of 20 mGy or 100 mGy or multiple 20 mGy doses) administered at various times prior to acute 2 Gy irradiation, confirming the lack of radio-adaptive response for induction of cytogenetic damage or suppression or erythrocyte proliferation/maturation in bone marrow of these mouse strains.
