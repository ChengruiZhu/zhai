We previously reported that low-dose X-irradiation alleviates ischemia-reperfusion injury such as mouse paw edema. In this study, we examined active changes in the biological function of mouse liver grafts in cold storage after low-dose X-irradiation. Mouse livers were sham-irradiated or were irradiated with 0.25, 0.5, 1.0, or 5.0 Gy of X-ray and stored for 4, 8, 24, or 48 h in preservation or saline solution. The results show that storage for 24 h in saline solution after 0.5 Gy irradiation significantly increased the activity of superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase. Following storage for 4, 8, or 48 h in preservation solution, lipid peroxide levels of the 0.5 Gy irradiated group were significantly lower than those of the sham irradiated group. Following storage for 24 h in preservation solution, the activity of SOD and catalase of the 1.0 Gy irradiated group were significantly higher than those of the sham irradiated group. Hepatocytes stored in saline solution were vacuolated. However, no vacuole formation was observed in hepatocytes stored in preservation solution. These findings suggest that low-dose irradiation significantly activates antioxidative functions of liver grafts. Moreover, the dose at which enhancement of antioxidative function occurs in livers stored in preservation solution, which contains glutathione, is significantly higher than that in saline solution.
