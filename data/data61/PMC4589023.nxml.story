We identified 158 patients who met inclusion criteria, which included 66 open subpectoral tenodeses and 92 arthroscopic tenodeses. Power analysis determined that 47 patients in each group (94 total) was the minimum number necessary to determine an 8 mm difference between groups. The average distance from the top of the humerus (TDH) in the arthroscopic suprapectoral group was 4.89 ± 0.8 cm, and in the open subpectoral group, 7.52 ± 1.2 cm. (Fig 1) This difference is statistically significant (p<0.0001). 12 (18%) distal outliers (more than one standard deviation distal) were found in the open subpectoral group. 11 (12%) proximal outliers were found in the arthroscopic suprapectoral group. Analysis determined that increased BMI and male gender were significant predictors for distal placement of an open tenodesis. No significant predictors of proximal arthroscopic tenodesis were found. Published cadaveric data localizes the proximal edge of the pectoralis major tendon to be 5.6 cm distal to the top of the humerus. Our data indicates that arthroscopic suprapectoral tenodesis results in a tenodesis location very near (within 0.7 cm on average) the proximal edge of pectoralis major tendon. Open subpectoral technique results in a truly subpectoral location, 1.9 cm distal to the proximal edge of the tendon, likely representing the clinical height of the pectoralis major tendon at the bicipital groove.
