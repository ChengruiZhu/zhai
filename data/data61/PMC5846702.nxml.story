Adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells (ASCs) have been shown to produce vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and can increase perfusion in patients with critical limb ischemia. We will show that this concept can be applied to augment blood flow in zones of flap ischemia. We presented a case study of a 26-year-old man with a complex hand injury covered by a reverse radial perforator fasciocutaneous flap, which developed ischemic necrosis and was treated by debridement, transplantation of ASCs to enhance vascular support, and saline dressings. ASCs are found in the stromal vascular fraction (SVF), a heterogeneous collection of cells, including pericytes and endothelial cells, that is prepared from lipoaspirate using collagenase digestion followed by centrifugation. These were injected into the flap, the palmar tissues both subjacent and peripheral to the flap, and the skin-grafted donor site. The case was documented with photography, measurements at hand therapy, and follow-up angiography MRI. At 72 hours, new vessels appeared diffusely; at 1 week, the remaining tissues of flap were bleeding. The wound, 11 cm Ã— 4 cm, contracted spontaneously and was healed at 21 days. The skin graft over the donor site demonstrated unusual suppleness and elasticity. 3D CT angiography disclosed a new layer of vascularity in the superficial tissues of the palm when compared with the normal side. The patient regained full composite flexion, pinch, opposition, and wrist extension. Application of ASCs into the supporting tissues surrounding the ischemic flap, and into the flap itself, constituted a form of in-situ revascularization (ISR) that was subjectively and objectively effective for this patient.
