Gut microbiota is associated with liver diseases. However, gut microbial characteristics of Buddâ€“Chiari syndrome (B-CS) have not been reported. Here, by MiSeq sequencing, gut microbial alterations were characterized among 37 health controls, 20 liver cirrhosis (LC) patients, 31 initial B-CS patients (B-CS group), 33 stability patients after BCS treatment (stability group) and 23 recurrent patients after BCS treatment (recurrence group). Gut microbial diversity was increased in B-CS versus LC. Bacterial community of B-CS clustered with controls but separated from LC. Operational taxonomic units (OTUs) 421, 502 (Clostridium IV) and 141 (Megasphaera) were unique to B-CS. Genera Escherichia/Shigella and Clostridium XI were decreased in B-CS versus controls. Moreover, nine genera, mainly including Bacteroides and Megamonas, were enriched in B-CS versus LC. Notably, Megamonas could distinguish B-CS from LC with areas under the curve (AUCs) of 0.7904. Microbial function prediction revealed that L-amino acid transport system activity was decreased in B-CS versus both LC and controls. Furthermore, OTUs 27 (Clostridium XI), 137 (Clostridium XIVb) and 40 (Bacteroides) were associated with B-CS stability. Importantly, genus Clostridium XI was enriched in stability group versus both recurrence group and B-CS group. Also, PRPP glutamine biosynthesis was reduced in stability group versus recurrence group, but was enriched in stability group versus B-CS group. In conclusion, specific microbial alterations associated with diagnosis and prognosis were detected in B-CS patients. Correction of gut microbial alterations may be a potential strategy for B-CS prevention and treatment.
