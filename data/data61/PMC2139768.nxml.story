Leukocyte adhesion to vascular endothelium under flow involves an adhesion cascade consisting of multiple receptor pairs that may function in an overlapping fashion. P-selectin glycoprotein ligand-1 (PSGL-1) and L-selectin have been implicated in neutrophil adhesion to P- and E-selectin under flow conditions. To study, in isolation, the interaction of PSGL-1 with P-and E-selectin under flow, we developed an in vitro model in which various recombinant regions of extracellular PSGL-1 were coupled to 10-μm-diameter microspheres. In a parallel plate chamber with well defined flow conditions, live time video microscopy analyses revealed that microspheres coated with PSGL-1 attached and rolled on 4-h tumor necrosis factor-α–activated endothelial cell monolayers, which express high levels of E-selectin, and CHO monolayers stably expressing E-or P-selectin. Further studies using CHO-E and -P monolayers demonstrate that the first 19 amino acids of PSGL-1 are sufficient for attachment and rolling on both E- and P-selectin and suggest that a sialyl Lewis x–containing glycan at Threonine-16 is critical for this sequence of amino acids to mediate attachment to E- and P-selectin. The data also demonstrate that a sulfated, anionic polypeptide segment within the amino terminus of PSGL-1 is necessary for PSGL-1–mediated attachment to P- but not to E-selectin. In addition, the results suggest that PSGL-1 has more than one binding site for E-selectin: one site located within the first 19 amino acids of PSGL-1 and one or more sites located between amino acids 19 through 148.
