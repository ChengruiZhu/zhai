A 65-year-old Caucasian male presented to the eye emergency department with bilateral significant visual loss. He was otherwise healthy with no significant past medical history. Ophthalmic history was significant for chronic open-angle glaucoma, for which the patient was using latanoprost once daily to both eyes. There was no preceding history of trauma or ocular surgery and the patient was emmetropic. Two weeks prior to his presentation, he reported a headache, which settled spontaneously. Slit-lamp examination demonstrated bilateral keratic precipitates, bilateral significantly shallow anterior chamber, and bilaterally normal intraocular pressures of 16 mm Hg. Fundal examination was significant for bilateral 360-degree choroidal detachments with exudative retinal detachment involving the maculae. These findings were confirmed using wide-field fundus photography, B-scan ultrasonography, and optical coherence tomography. Fundus fluorescein angiography did not reveal any evidence of retinal vasculitis. Indocyanine green chorioangiography of the posterior pole showed multiple areas of focal choroidal hypoperfusion. Extensive systemic investigation demonstrated no infectious, neoplastic, or inflammatory cause, and the patient did not complain of any systemic symptoms. Treatment with high-dose intravenous methylprednisolone was administered and this brought about complete resolution of both choroidal and retinal detachments, with partial visual recovery.
