Cell-free fibronectin matrix (FN-matrix) isolated from chick embryo fibroblasts was used to study cell-matrix interaction. After 24 h, most fibroblastic cells, including those without cell surface fibronectin, adopted bipolar fusiform morphology. Cells grew in parallel arrays and aligned with each other apparently along FN-matrix. Since the orientation of fibronectin fibers was determined by chick embryo fibroblasts, our results suggested that intercellular organization of "matrix-using" cell type may be influenced by "matrix-producing" cell type. Whereas the elongation and alignment effects induced by FN-matrix have been detected in fibroblasts (both normal and transformed), myoblast, aortic endothelial cells, neural cell lines (B103 and RT4D1), and cardiac muscle cells, similar effects are not detected in bone marrow hemopoietic cells, circulating lymphocytic T and B cells, and sympathetic neurons. For epithelial cells, FN-matrix has varying effects. Elongation and alignment effects are detected only in transformed epithelial cells with a great reduction in keratin expression. The morphology of normal or transformed epithelial cells with abundant keratin appears unaffected by FN-matrix. FN-matrix reduced the growth of several transformed fibroblastic lines up to 25%, but did not restore the appearance of actin stress fibers and the normal migratory activities of Rous sarcoma virus-transformed rat cells.
