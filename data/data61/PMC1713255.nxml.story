Evolutionary perspectives, including the classification of living organisms, provide the unifying scaffold on which biological knowledge is assembled. Researchers in many areas of biology use evolutionary classifications (taxonomy) in many ways, including as a means for interpreting the origin of evolutionary innovations, as a framework for comparative genetics/genomics, and as the basis for drawing broad conclusions about the diversity of living organisms. Thus, it is essential that taxonomy be robust. Here the authors evaluate the stability of and support for the current classification system of eukaryotic cells (cells with nuclei) in which eukaryotes are divided into six kingdom level categories, or supergroups. These six supergroups unite diverse microbial and macrobial eukaryotic lineages, including the well-known groups of plants, animals, and fungi. The authors assess the stability of supergroup classifications through time and reveal a rapidly changing taxonomic landscape that is difficult to navigate for the specialist and generalist alike. Additionally, the authors find variable support for each of the supergroups in published analyses based on DNA sequence variation. The support for supergroups differs according to the taxonomic area under study and the origin of the genes (e.g., nuclear, plastid) used in the analysis. Encouragingly, combining a conservative approach to taxonomy with increased sampling of microbial eukaryotes and the use of multiple types of data is likely to produce a robust scaffold for the eukaryotic tree of life.
