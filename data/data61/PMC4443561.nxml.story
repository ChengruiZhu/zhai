Paragangliomas (PGL) are rare lesions of the neuroendocrine system; in the neck, they usually affect the carotid glomus (carotid body tumours-CBT). This retrospective analysis reports our experience in management of these lesions in patients treated by surgical resection. Between 2000 and 2014, 33 patients were surgically treated at our institution, obtaining a series of 44 cervical PGLs. Tumour characteristics, family history, diagnostic procedures, surgical treatment, short- and long-term outcomes were reviewed. A female prevalence was found (76% of cases). Familial cases occurred in 9 patients (20%); 6 presented with bilateral lesions and 1 had multiple paragangliomas. Lymph node metastasis was not found in any patient. All lesions were classified into three groups according to the latero-lateral diameter. Complete resection of the PGL was performed in all patients. Mortality was null; transitory cranial nerve deficit occurred in 20% of cases with permanent palsy in 6.7%. No perioperative stroke/TIA were observed. Surgical resection of PGL should be considered as the only therapeutic option because it can ensure complete removal of the disease. Patients with bilateral lesions and positive family history should be referred for genetic analysis. Preoperative planning of the surgical procedure by integrated diagnostic imaging and a full mastery of vascular surgery techniques are mandatory to minimise the risk of the most common postoperative complications. Long-term follow-up is recommended, particularly in patients with familial disease or sporadic lesions treated in an advanced stage.
