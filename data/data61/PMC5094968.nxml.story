A nomogram based on both western and eastern populations to estimate the Disease Specific Survival (DSS) of resectable gastric cancer (RGC) has not been established. In current study, we retrospectively analyzed 4,379 RGC patients who underwent curative resection from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database. Patients diagnosed between 1998 and 2009 were assigned as training set (n= 2,770), and the rest were selected as SEER validation set (n= 1,609). An external validation was performed by a set of independent 1,358 RGC patients after D2 resection from Sun Yat–sen University Cancer Center (SYSUCC) in China. The nomogram was constructed based on the training set. The multivariate analysis identified that patient's age at diagnosis, race, tumor location, grade, depth of invasion, metastatic lymph node stage (mLNS) and total number of examined lymph node (TLN) were associated with patient's DSS. The discrimination of this nomogram was superior to that of the 7th edition of AJCC staging system in SEER validation set and SYSUCC validation set (0.73 versus 0.70, p=0.005; 0.76 versus 0.72, p=0.005; respectively). Calibration plots of the nomogram showed that the probability of DSS corresponded to actual observation closely. In conclusion, our nomogram resulted in more–reliable prognostic prediction for RGC patients in general population.
