NOD1 (nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain 1) is overexpressed in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) cells, as is IL-8 in cancer cells. However, the mechanism of the IL-8-mediated overexpression of NOD in HNSCC not been identified. This study determines whether IL-8 promotes tumor progression via the NOD signaling pathway in HNSCC. Higher IL-8, NOD1 and receptor-interacting protein kinase (RIP2) expressions were observed in HNSCC tissue than in non-cancerous matched tissue (NCMT), whereas NOD2 was weakly expressed. Furthermore, IL-8 stimulated the proliferation of HNSCC cells (SCC4, SCC9 and SCC25) but not dysplastic oral mucosa DOK cells. Exposure to IL-8 increased the clonogenicity of HNSCC cells. IL-8 siRNA inhibited cell proliferation and cell colony formation, suggesting that IL-8 is involved in HNSCC cancer progression. The expressions of CXCR1 and CXCR2 were higher in HNSCC tissue than in NCMT. HNSCC cells that were exposed to IL-8 exhibited higher expression of CXCR1/2 than did controls. The blocking of IL-8 by siRNA reduced CXCR1/2 expression in HNSCC cells, suggesting that the cancer progression of HNSCC cells that is induced by IL-8 depends on CXCR1/2. Additionally, IL-8 is associated with increased NOD1 and RIP2 expression and reduced NOD2 expression in three types of HNSCC cells. The blocking of IL-8 by siRNA reduces IL-8, NOD1 and RIP2 expressions in HNSCC cells, but not the level of NOD2. These results suggest that IL-8 has an important role in HNSCC progression via a CXCR1/2-meidated NOD1/RIP2 signaling pathway.
