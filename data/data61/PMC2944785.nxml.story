Neurodegenerative diseases feature concentration of misfolded or damaged proteins into inclusion bodies. There is controversy over whether these entities are protective, detrimental, or relatively benign. The formation of inclusion bodies may be accelerated by inefficient protein degradation and may promote activation of stress signalling pathways. Each of these events may promote the generation of reactive oxygen species which may exacerbate the problem by damaging more proteins, possibly damaging components of the UPS itself, but in either case further impeding the function of cellular proteolytic systems. To determine how these events are related and which are critical, we generated a live cell imaging system in which inclusion formation and proteolytic efficiency can be evaluated, and created a stochastic computer model incorporating the same components. Laboratory data and computer simulations were found to be in close agreement, supporting a mechanism wherein misfolded protein induced a vicious cycle of stress kinase activation, ROS generation, and proteasome inhibition which was ultimately cytotoxic. Inclusion body formation partially alleviated the burden on the proteolytic system, but may not provide long term benefit. Pharmacological blockade of a stress-activated kinase was effective in breaking the vicious cycle, as predicted by the computer model and confirmed experimentally.
