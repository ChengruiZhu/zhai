 muscle were confirmed in the sartorius. In addition, the transverse tubules were observed to be continuous across the width of the fiber, a set of flat intermediate cisternae was seen to connect the terminal cisternae to the longitudinal tubules in the A band, and the continuous reticulum collar at the center of the A band was found to be perforated by circular and elongated pores (the fenestrated collar). The transverse tubules have a volume about 0.3 per cent of the fiber volume, and a surface area about 7 times the outer cylindrical surface area for a fiber 100 µ in diameter. The terminal cisternae, the intermediate cisternae, and the longitudinal tubules together with the fenestrated collar each have a volume of 4 to 5 per cent of the fiber volume and a surface area 40 to 50 times the outer surface area of a fiber 100 µ in diameter. Some evidence for continuity of the transverse tubules with the fiber surface is presented, but this is thought to be not so convincing as evidence presented by others. The results are discussed in terms of a possible mechanism for a role of the transverse tubules and sarcoplasmic reticulum in excitation-contraction coupling, as suggested by their morphology and a variety of physiological studies. In this scheme, the transverse tubules are thought to be electrically coupled to the terminal cisternae, so that depolarization of the fiber surface spreads inward along the transverse tubules and to the terminal cisternae, initiating the release of a contraction-activating substance.
