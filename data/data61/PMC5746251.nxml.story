Training can modify the visual system to produce improvements on perceptual tasks (visual perceptual learning), which is associated with adult brain plasticity. Visual perceptual learning has important clinical applications: it improves the vision of adults with visual deficits, e.g. amblyopia and cortical blindness, and even presbyopia (aging eye). A critical issue in visual perceptual learning is its specificity to the trained stimulus. Specificity gives insight into the processes underling experience-dependent plasticity but can be an obstacle in the development of efficient rehabilitation protocols. Under what circumstances visual perceptual learning transfers to untrained stimuli is poorly understood. Here we report a qualitatively new phenomenon: specificity in visual search depends on intrinsic variations in the reliability of feature representations; e.g., vertically oriented lines are represented in V1 with greater reliability than tilted lines. Our data and computational model suggest that training on sensory features with intrinsically low reliability can maximize the generalizability of learning, particularly in complex natural environments in which task performance is limited by low-reliability features. Our study has possible implications for the development of efficient clinical applications of perceptual learning.
