Recent comparative analyses of vertebrate genomes has resulted in the identification of highly conserved non-coding sequences near genes that coordinate early development. Many of these sequences can activate gene expression and are thought to be important regulatory elements. Surprisingly, a large set of these long, near-identical sequences is found in every jawed vertebrate, including sharks, yet almost completely absent in non-vertebrates. This study looks for this set of sequences in the lamprey, a representative of our most distant vertebrate relatives, in order to determine when and how such a large set of important non-coding regulatory sequences became established in the genome. Although the lamprey divergence is only a little older than the divergence of cartilaginous fish (including sharks), relatively few, and considerably shorter, conserved non-coding sequences are identifiable. Nevertheless, these shorter lamprey sequences are capable of driving gene expression in a precise spatial pattern in zebrafish embryos in the same way as the equivalent human elements. This analysis has shed light on the emergence of these regulatory sequences during early vertebrate evolution, at a time of whole-genome duplications and considerable morphological variation, consistent with a role for these sequences in directing gene regulatory networks for vertebrate development.
