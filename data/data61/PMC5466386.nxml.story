Inflammation and remodeling play a role in the pathogenesis of pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH). Nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) and nuclear factor of activated T cells-1 (NFAT-1) participate in inflammation and remodeling in a number of diseases. As a tryptophan hydroxylase inhibitor, 4-chloro-DL-phenylalanine (PCPA) had been reported to exert anti-inflammatory and remodeling effects. Therefore, we hypothesized that PCPA may attenuate monocrotaline (MCT)-induced PAH through the NFAT-1 and NF-κB signaling pathways. In order to confirm our hypothesis, we divided 68 Sprague-Dawley male rats into 4 groups as follows: the control, MCT, MCT + P1 and MCT + P2 groups. MCT was administered at a dose of 60 mg/kg once via intraperitoneal injection. PCPA was administered via intraperitoneal injection at a dose of 50 or 100 mg/kg once daily for 21 consecutive days. We then measured the hemodynamic index and morphological analysis was carried out on the lung tissues. Western blot analysis and immunohistochemistry were used to examine the levels of NFAT-1 and NF-κB p-65. The expression levels of phosphorylated inhibitor of NF-κB kinase (p-IKK), IKK, phosphorylated extracellular signal-regulated kinase (p-ERK), ERK, intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) and interleukin-6 (IL-6) were examined by western blot analysis. MCT was found to significantly induce PAH, with inflammation and remodeling of the lung tissues. This was associatd with an increased expression of NFAT-1, p-IKK, p-ERK and nuclear p65. PCPA significantly attenuated MCT-induced inflammation and arterial remodeling, and decreased the expression of NFAT-1, as well as that of relevant proteins of the NF-κB signaling pathway. The above-mentioned findings suggest that the inhibitory effects of PCPA on MCT-induced inflammation and arterial remodeling are related to the downregulation of the NFAT-1 and NF-κB signaling pathways in rats with PAH.
