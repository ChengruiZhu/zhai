Managing precocious puberty (PP) has been a challenge due to lack of standardized definition, gonadotrophins assay, gonadotrophin stimulation, timings for blood sampling, and parameters for assessing outcomes. This review evaluated available literature to simplify the algorithm for managing gonadotrophin dependent/central PP (CPP), with an Indian perspective. CPP is one of the commonest forms of PP and mimics the normal course of puberty, at an age <8 and 9 years for girls and boys respectively. Basal and post gonadotrophin hormone releasing hormone analog (GnRHa) luteinizing hormone (LH) ≥0.3–0.6 IU/L and ≥4–5 IU/L (30–60 min after GnRH/GnRHa administration) respectively, using modern ultrasensitive automated chemiluminescence assays, can be considered positive for central puberty initiation. Uterine length of >3.5 cm and uterine volume of >1.8 ml are two most specific indicators for true CPP. Therapy is indicated in children with CPP with accelerated bone age, height advancement, or psychosocial stress. Treatment goal is to halt puberty progression to a socially acceptable age, allowing the child to attain optimal height potential. GnRHa is the treatment of choice, with best height outcomes when initiated <6 years age. Treatment is recommended till 11 years age. LH suppression to <3 U/L may be a reasonable target in patients on GnRHa therapy. Medroxyprogesterone acetate holds an important place in managing PP in India, cause of high costs associated with GnRHa therapy. There is an urgent need for clinical trials from India, for establishing Indian cut-off for diagnosis, treatment and follow-up of children with PP.
