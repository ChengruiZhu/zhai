Tumor progression in patients with recurrent malignant glioma who respond to bevacizumab (BEV) is difficult to assess. The current study reviewed the clinical and radiological results of patients following a BEV-based chemotherapy regimen, and evaluated disease progression patterns in patients who responded to BEV therapy. From August 2011 to November 2015, 24 patients (18 glioblastoma cases and 6 anaplastic astrocytoma cases) were treated with BEV-based chemotherapy. In total, 6 patients were treated with BEV alone and 18 patients were treated with BEV combined with irinotecan. The male-female ratio was 10:14, and the median age was 47.5 years (range, 29–69). Patient performance status (PS) was classified using the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group PS scores as follows: PS 1 (n=3), PS 2 (n=9), PS 3 (n=9) and PS 4 (n=3). Treatment-associated complications were also analyzed according to the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 4.0. Treatment responses were estimated using the Response Assessment in Neuro-Oncology Criteria. Progression-free survival (PFS) following treatment, patterns of disease progression and overall survival following treatment failure were also analyzed. The median PFS was 2.8 months (range, 0.6–10.1). In total, 2 patients did not continue treatment due to rectal bleeding and severe hematologic toxicity. Amongst the BEV responders (n=16, 72.7%), there was clinical deterioration without significant radiological progression in 2 patients (n=2, 12.5%). Radiological progression of non-enhancing lesions without enhancement flare-ups was observed in 6 patients (42.9%). A total of 3 of those lesions were diffuse and 3 were focal. Increased lesion enhancement was observed in 8 patients (57.1%). Of the non-responders (n=6, 27.3%), diffuse enlargement of non-enhancing lesions was detected in 2 patients and an increase in lesion enhancement occurred in 4 patients. BEV complete responders (n=3) radiologically progressed with enlarged T2/fluid attenuation inversion recovery lesions without enhancement, followed by enhancement flare-ups. Following BEV treatment failure, 8 patients received a number of adjuvant treatments and the overall survival was 4.5 months (range, 0.4–34.0). Clinical symptoms and radiological alterations of non-enhancing lesions must be evaluated in order to assess tumor progression in the BEV responders, particularly in patients who have achieved complete remission.
