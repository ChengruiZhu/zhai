This study investigated the survival and prognosis of 298 gastric adenocarcinoma patients with no distant metastasis. For analysis and comparison of the prognosis of patients, a retrospective analysis was performed in 298 patients with perfect clinical data and follow-up data who received the D2 resections for gastric cancer in Shandong Provincial Hospital Affiliated to Shandong University between January, 2005 and January, 2012, and were diagnosed as gastric adenocarcinoma with no distant metastasis in postoperative pathological examination. Among the gastric adenocarcinoma patients without distant metastasis, we found that differences of sex, age, differentiation and position of tumor had no statistical significance (P>0.05), while comparisons of the tumor diameter, regional lymphatic metastasis, vascular invasion and pathological TNM stages (pTNM; T for tumor, N for lymph node and M for metastasis) showed statistical significance (P<0.05). One-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) indicated the correlation between the prognosis of gastric adenocarcinoma patients and tumor diameter, regional lymphatic metastasis, vascular invasion and pTNM stages of patients (P<0.05). Multivariate analysis of Cox regression models was performed for discovering the factors associated with the prognosis of patients, and the results suggested that position of tumor (P=0.016), regional lymphatic metastasis (P=0.042), vascular invasion (P=0.021) and pTNM stage (P=0.009) were the independent risk factors affecting the prognosis of gastric adenocarcinoma patients. During 60-month follow-up, the median survival duration of gastric adenocarcinoma patients with no distant metastasis was 38 months, while the 5-year accumulate survival rate was 49.3%. The results indicated that in gastric adenocarcinoma patients without distant metastasis, tumor diameter, regional lymphatic metastasis, vascular invasion and pTNM stage are major indicators affecting the prognosis of patients.
