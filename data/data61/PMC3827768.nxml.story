The objective of this research was to determine the kinematic variables evolution in a sprint canoeing maximal test over 200 m, comparing women and men kayak paddlers and men canoeists. Speed evolution, cycle frequency, cycle length and cycle index were analysed each 50 m section in fifty-two young paddlers (20 male kayakers, 17 female kayakers and 15 male canoeists; 13â€“14 years-old). Recordings were taken from a boat which followed each paddler trial in order to measure the variables cited above. Kinematic evolution was similar in the three categories, the speed and cycle index decreased through the test after the first 50 m. Significant differences were observed among most of the sections in speed and the cycle index (p<0.05 and <0.01, respectively). Cycle length remained stable showing the lowest values in the first section when compared with the others (p<0.01). Cycle frequency progressively decreased along the distance. Significant differences were identified in the majority of the sections (p<0.01). Men kayakers attained higher values in all the variables than women kayakers and men canoeists, but only such variables as speed, cycle length and cycle index were observed to be significantly higher (p<0.01). Moreover, lower kinematic values were obtained from men canoeists. The study of the evolution of kinematic variables can provide valuable information for athletes and coaches while planning training sessions and competitions.
