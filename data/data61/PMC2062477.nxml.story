In organisms that reproduce sexually, sex cells (gametes) are produced by the specialized cell division called meiosis, which halves the number of chromosomes from two sets (diploid) to one (haploid). During meiosis, homologous DNA molecules exchange genetic material in a process called homologous recombination, thereby contributing to genetic diversity. In addition, a subset of recombinants, called crossovers, creates connections between chromosomes that are required for those chromosomes to be accurately segregated. Accurate segregation ensures that gametes contain one and only one copy of each chromosome. Recombination is initiated by chromosome breakage. A regulatory process then selects a subset of breaks to be healed by a mechanism that forms crossover recombinants. Many of the remaining breaks are healed to form so-called “noncrossover” recombinants (also referred to as “gene conversions”). Until recently, it was thought that crossovers and noncrossovers were formed by nearly identical pathways; which type of recombinant arose was thought to depend on how the last enzyme in the pathway attacked the last DNA intermediate. However, more recent observations suggested that noncrossover recombinants might arise by a mechanism involving less-stable intermediates than those required to make crossovers. In the present work, a yeast strain was constructed that allowed the detection of a genetic signature of such unstable recombination intermediates. This strain provided evidence that meiotic crossovers and noncrossovers do indeed form by quite different mechanisms.
