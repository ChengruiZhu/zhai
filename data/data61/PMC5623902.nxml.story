Lysine-specific demethylase 1A (LSD1, KDM1A) specifically demethylates di- and monomethylated histones H3K4 and K9, resulting in context-dependent transcriptional repression or activation. We previously identified an irreversible LSD1 inhibitor T-3775440, which exerts antileukemic activities in a subset of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cell lines by inducing cell transdifferentiation. The NEDD8-activating enzyme inhibitor pevonedistat (MLN4924, TAK-924) is an investigational drug with antiproliferative activities in AML, and is also reported to induce cell differentiation. We therefore tested the combination of these two agents in AML models. The combination treatment resulted in synergistic growth inhibition of AML cells, accompanied by enhanced transdifferentiation of an erythroid leukemia lineage into granulomonocytic-like lineage cells. In addition, pevonedistat-induced rereplication stress during the S phase was greatly augmented by concomitant treatment with T-3775440, as reflected by the increased induction of apoptosis. We further demonstrated that the combination treatment was markedly effective in subcutaneous tumor xenograft models as well as in a disseminated model of AML, leading to tumor eradication or prolonged survival in T-3775440/pevonedistat cotreated mice. Our findings indicate the therapeutic potential of the combination of LSD1 inhibitors and pevonedistat for the treatment of AML.
