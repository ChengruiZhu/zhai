In this study, by using X-ray powder diffraction profiles as blueprints, we successfully mapped the most probable molecular-level structural arrangement of the PMMA super-helix stereocomplexes through molecular dynamic simulations. Molecular-level resolution of the PMMA triple-helix supramolecule was not previously achievable by experimental methods. After constructing molecular models of stereo-regular complexes composed of linear it- and st-PMMAs, our all-atom molecular dynamics simulations identified the stereocomplex structure that best reproduces experimental diffraction profiles and thermodynamic properties as a double helix of isotactic (it-)PMMA with a helical pitch of 1.8 nm and 9 units per turn surrounded by a single helix of syndiotactic (st-)PMMA with an average helical pitch of 0.9 nm and 20 units per turn. The it-/st- complexing stoichiometry in the PMMA triple-helix is therefore 9 : 20. This presents the first all-atom model of the it-/st-PMMA triple-helix stereocomplex that accurately fits experimental X-ray diffraction profiles. In addition, the simulation results revealed the outer st-PMMA helix of the PMMA stereocomplex has a fiber diameter of at least 1.85 nm and adopts a non-ideal helical geometry. Furthermore, through dynamic simulations, surprising new sights into the effect of the structural configuration of the PMMA stereocomplex (
