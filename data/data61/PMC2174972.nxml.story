For viral infection to succeed, viral proteins must interact with the cellular signaling machinery of its target cell. An oncoprotein encoded by the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) called latent membrane protein 1 (LMP1) is a primary contributor to the transformation of human B cells by the virus and the development of EBV-associated B cell malignancies by recruiting signaling molecules provided by the host. One such molecule, the cellular adapter protein TRADD, is among the few direct interaction partners of LMP1. But because TRADD promotes cell death (apoptosis) in the cellular tumor necrosis factor-receptor 1 (TNFR1) signaling pathway, it seems counterintuitive that TRADD could play a role in LMP1 biology, since LMP1 promotes cell survival and proliferation. We provide genetic evidence that TRADD is critical for LMP1 to assemble its transforming signaling network. LMP1 requires TRADD to recruit and activate I-κB kinase β and, thus, to induce canonical NF-κB signaling. Simultaneously, LMP1 masks TRADD's pro-apoptotic activity. We show that LMP1 carries a unique and autonomous viral TRADD-binding domain, which dictates an unusual structure of the LMP1-TRADD complex and the nonapoptotic phenotype of TRADD signaling, irrespective of the receptor context in which this domain is located. Thus, DNA tumor viruses alter the functional properties of cellular signaling molecules to exploit them for their own purpose of cell transformation.
