The pancreatic duct secretes alkaline fluid that is rich in HCO3- and poor in Cl-. The molecular mechanisms that mediate ductal secretion and are responsible for the axial gradients of Cl- and HCO3- along the ductal tree are not well understood because H+ and HCO3- transport by duct cells have not been characterized or localized. To address these questions, we microdissected the intralobular, main, and common segments of the rat pancreatic duct. H+ and HCO3- transporters were characterized and localized by following intracellular pH while perfusing the bath and the lumen of the ducts. In intralobular ducts, Na(+)-dependent and amiloride-sensitive recovery from acid load in the absence of HCO3- was used to localize a Na+/H+ exchanger to the basolateral membrane (BLM). Modification of Cl- gradients across the luminal (LM) and BLM in the presence of HCO3- showed the presence of Cl- /HCO3- exchangers on both membranes of intralobular duct cells. Measurement of the effect of Cl- on one side of the membrane on the rate and extent of pHi changes caused by removal and addition of Cl- to the opposite side suggested that both exchangers are present in the same cell. In the presence of HCO3-, intralobular duct cells used three separate mechanisms to extrude H+: (a) BLM-located Na+/H+ exchange, (b) Na(+)-independent vacuolar-type H+ pump, and (c) BLM-located, Na(+)- dependent, amiloride-insensitive, and 4',4'-diisothiocyanatostilbene- 2,2'-disulfonic acid sensitive mechanism, possibly a Na(+)-dependent HCO3- transporter. The main and common segments of the duct displayed similar mechanisms and localization of H+ and HCO3- transporters to the extent studied in the present work. In addition to the transporters found in intralobular ducts, the main and common ducts showed Na+/H+ exchange activity in the LM. Three tests were used to exclude a significant luminal to basolateral Na+ leak as the cause for an apparent luminal Na+/H+ exchange in an HCO3- secreting cells: (a) addition of amiloride and removal of Na+ from the LM had a profound effect on Na+/H+ exchange activity on the BLM and vice versa; (b) inhibition of all transporters in the BLM by bathing the duct in the inert hydrocarbon Fluorinert FC-75 did not prevent cytosolic acidification caused by removal of luminal Na+; and (c) luminal Na+ did not activate the basolateral Na(+)-dependent HCO3- transporter. An Na(+)-independent, bafilomycin-sensitive H+ pumping activity was marginal in the absence of HCO3-.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)
