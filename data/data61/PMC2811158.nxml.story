, a part of the photosynthetic complex responsible for light harvesting (the photosynthetic antennae) becomes reversibly phosphorylated and migrates between the photosystems to redistribute light-derived energy. The protein kinase responsible for phosphorylating photosynthetic antenna proteins was identified recently. However, despite extensive biochemical efforts to isolate the enzyme that catalyzes the corresponding dephosphorylation reaction, the identity of this protein phosphatase has remained unknown. In this study, we identified and characterized the thylakoid-associated phosphatase TAP38. We first demonstrate by spectroscopic measurements that the redistribution of excitation energy between photosystems that are characteristic of state transitions do not take place in plants without a functional TAP38 protein. We then show that the phosphorylation of photosynthetic antenna proteins is markedly increased in plants without TAP38, but decreased in plants that express more TAP38 protein than wild-type plants. This, together with the observation that addition of recombinant TAP38 decreases the level of antenna protein phosphorylation in an in vitro assay, suggests that TAP38 directly acts on the photosynthetic antenna proteins as the critical phosphatase regulating state transitions. Moreover, in plants without TAP38, photosynthetic electron flow is enhanced, resulting in more rapid growth under constant low-light regimes, thus providing the first instance of a mutant plant with improved photosynthesis.
