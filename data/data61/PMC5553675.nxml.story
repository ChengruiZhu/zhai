Inflammatory response, oxidative stress, and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress are important pathophysiological bases of the occurrence and development of diabetes mellitus (DM) and macroangiopathy complications. Selenoprotein S (SELENOS) is involved in the regulation of these mechanisms; therefore, its association with DM and macroangiopathy has gradually received attention from scholars worldwide. SELENOS has different biological functions in different tissues and organs: it exerts antioxidant protection and has anti-ER stress effects in the pancreas and blood vessels, while it promotes the occurrence and development of insulin resistance in the liver, adipose tissue, and skeletal muscle. In addition, studies have confirmed that some SELENOS gene polymorphisms can influence the inflammatory response and are closely associated with the risk for developing DM and macroangiopathy. Therefore, comprehensive understanding of the association between SELENOS and inflammation, oxidative stress, and ER stress may better elucidate and supplement the pathogenic mechanisms of DM and macroangiopathy complications. Furthermore, in-depth investigation of the association of SELENOS function in different tissues and organs with DM and macroangiopathy may facilitate the development of new strategies for the prevention and treatment of DM and macrovascular complications. Here, we summarize the consensus and controversy regarding functions of SELENOS on currently available evidence.
