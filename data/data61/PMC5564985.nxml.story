A total of 108 pediatric patients (mean age 13.4, range 7-14 years) were included (79 boys and 29 girls). Fifty (46.3%) patients had a LLD of ≥5 mm of which 33 (66%) sustained ACL injury of their shorter leg and 17 (34%) of their longer leg. Twelve (11.1%) patients had a LLD of ≥10 mm of which 9 (75%) had ACL injury of the shorter leg and 3 (25%) of their longer leg. Thirty-five (32.4%) and thirty-four (31.5%) patients had ≥ 5 mm of length discrepancy between the femurs and tibias, respectively. Three (2.8%) and nine (8.3%) patients had ≥10 mm of length discrepancy between the femurs and tibias, respectively. When comparing the coronal alignment of the injured leg with the contralateral leg, it was noted that the MAD was displaced 6.6±9.4mm lateral (valgus) with ACL injury vs. 1.4±8.1mm lateral without injury (p<0.001). (Table 1) The mTFA and mLDFA of the injured leg had a greater valgus alignment than the non-injury leg (2.4°±2.7 and 85.2°±2.2 vs. 0.9°±2.3 and 86.1°±1.82; p<0.001). Stratifying results by gender, similar findings were seen when comparing the leg with ACL injury versus the leg without ACL injury for MAD (boys: 6.9±9.2mm lateral vs. 1.7±8.3mm lateral, respectively, p<0.001; girls: 6.0±9.7mm lateral vs. 0.9±7.8mm lateral, respectively, p=0.031). Pelvic width was larger in girls when compared to boys (166±17mm vs. 155±18mm, respectively, p=0.005).
