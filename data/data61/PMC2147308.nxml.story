 1. Lysolipid was prepared by the action of snake venom on egg yolk, and a study was made of the factors affecting its hemolytic action upon rabbit erythrocytes. 2. Lysis proceeded very rapidly at first, then ceased within a few minutes at room temperature. A given amount of lysin appeared to hemolyze a fixed number of cells, under specified conditions. 3. The more dilute erythrocyte suspensions required relatively more lysin per cell, for 50 per cent hemolysis of the suspension. There may be an equilibrium between the lysin dissolved in the medium and that adsorbed on the cells. 4. The degree of hemolysis for varying lysin concentrations was measured, and the cells showed a typical distribution of resistance to hemolysis. 5. As the temperature was lowered lysis was more extensive. Adsorption of the lysin on the cell surface was apparently increased. 6. The resistance of the erythrocytes to lysis increased slightly as the pH was raised from 5.5 to 7.8. 7. Resistance to lysis was independent of the tonicity of the medium and of initial cell volume. The magnitude of the cell surface was probably the determining factor. 8. A marked shrinkage of the erythrocytes was observed in the presence of calcium ions and lysin, but not in the absence of the lysin. 9. Hemolytic resistance curves obtained by the Wilbrandt technique were of the "colloid-osmotic" type. However, there was no evidence of prolytic loss of potassium ions. 10. Hypotonic fragility of the cells was slightly increased in the presence of the lysin. The rate of penetration of thiourea was greatly increased.
