Tracheal stenosis is a potential complication of tracheostomy. The present study aimed to describe the epidemiologic profile of subglottic stenosis in a referral medical centre. During a 4-year period, all patients who had been admitted in an Intensive Care Unit of Imam Khomeini Hospital (affiliated to Tehran University of Medical Sciences) and had undergone percutaneous tracheostomy during 7-10 days after endotracheal intubation were enrolled in the study. After removing the tracheostomy tube, patients were evaluated regarding development of tracheal stenosis using fiberoptic bronchoscopy and multi-slice computed tomography scan. During the study period, percutaneous tracheostomy was performed in 140 patients with a mean age of 38 years. Overall 54 patients died due to the severity of the disorder during hospitalization. In the remaining 86 patients, 54 cases needed permanent or long-term mechanical ventilation and were excluded from the study. Twelve patients died during the first 3 months and 20 patients were left for final assessment. Multi-slice computed tomography scan imaging showed subglottic stenosis in 17 cases (85%). Of these, 9 patients (52%) had tracheal stenosis of < 50%. Tracheal stenosis of 25- 40% was found in 5 cases (25%). Patients in whom the tracheostomy tube had been removed in the first 3 weeks after tracheostomy did not present tracheal stenosis (n = 3, 15%). The present study revealed that subglottic stenosis is frequent in patients who have undergone percutaneous tracheostomy in the Intensive Care unit setting. However, the stenosis is generally mild and is not associated with serious and/ or life-threatening clinical manifestations.
