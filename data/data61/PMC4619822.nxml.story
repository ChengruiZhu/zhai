One prevailing viewpoint on the genesis of absence seizures is suggested to involve the pathological interactions within the corticothalamic system. As intriguing deep nuclei of brain, the basal ganglia are reported to play crucial roles in controlling absence seizures through multiple nigro-thalamic pathways. Beside these nigro-thalamic pathways, recent experiments have identified a new direct GABAergic pallido-cortical pathway projecting from the globus pallidus externa (GPe) to the cerebral cortex. Does this novel identified inhibitory pallido-cortical pathway also participate in regulating absence seizures? By computational modelling, we demonstrated that this inhibitory pallido-cortical pathway indeed participates in the control of absence seizures. Specifically, both activating the GPe neurons and enhancing the strength of this pathway significantly inhibit the typical 2â€“4 Hz spike and wave discharges (SWDs) during absence seizures. Further investigation showed that appropriate tuning of several GPe-related pathways may trigger the SWD suppression by activating GPe neurons, and also the strength of this inhibitory pallido-cortical pathway may regulate the so-called bidirectional control of absence seizures caused by direct nigro-thalamic pathways. These results highlight the functional roles of the GABAergic pallido-cortical pathway in controlling absence seizures and have important physiological implications in the treatment of absence epilepsy.
