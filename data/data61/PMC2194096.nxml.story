Interferon (IFN)-γ is necessary for tumor immunity, however, its initial cellular source is unknown. Because γδ T cells primarily produce this cytokine upon activation, we hypothesized that they would provide an important early source of IFN-γ in tumor immunosurveillance. To address this hypothesis, we first demonstrated that γδ T cell–deficient mice had a significantly higher incidence of tumor development after challenge with a chemical carcinogen methylcholanthrene (MCA) or inoculation with the melanoma cell line B16. In wild-type mice, γδ T cells were recruited to the site of tumor as early as day 3 after inoculation, followed by αβ T cells at day 5. We then used bone marrow chimeras and fetal liver reconstitutions to create mice with an intact γδ T cell repertoire but one that was specifically deficient in the capacity to produce IFN-γ. Such mice had a higher incidence of tumor development, induced either with MCA or by inoculation of B16 melanoma cells, compared with mice with IFN-γ–competent γδ T cells. Moreover, genetic deficiency of γδ T cells resulted in impaired IFN-γ production by tumor antigen-triggered αβ T cell upon immunization with tumor lysate. These results demonstrate that γδ T cells can play a necessary role in tumor immunity through provision of an early source of IFN-γ that in turn may regulate the function of tumor-triggered αβ T cells.
