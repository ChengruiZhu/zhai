The objective of the present study was to analyze the relationship between genetic polymorphisms of the rs2736098 locus of the telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT) gene and the rs401681 locus of the cleft lip and palate transmembrane protein 1 (CLPTM1L) gene and the risk of developing lung cancer in males in Jinzhou. A total of 214 lung cancer patients who were admitted in Jinzhou Medical University were analyzed, and 216 healthy males were selected as controls. Venous blood from all subjects and data on relevant risk factors were collected. DNA was extracted from peripheral blood by the phenol-chloroform method. Real-time fluorescent quantitative PCR (TaqMan real-time PCR) was used for DNA amplification. The genotyping results of the genetic polymorphisms of the TERT rs2736098 and CLPTM1L rs401681 loci were detected. The risk of developing lung cancer in the population with the TERT rs2736098 locus carrying the T allele was 1.614 times that with the TERT rs2736098 locus carrying the C allele after adjustment of the age factor. The risk of developing lung cancer in the population carrying the TT mutant genotype and the CT genotype increased significantly compared with that carrying the CC wild genotype [odds ratio (OR)=1.815, 95% CI=1.132–2.957; OR=2.417, 95% CI=1.158–4.943]. Based on a comparison between the combination of the two mutant genotypes (CT+TT) and the wild homozygous genotype (CC), the mutant genotype increased the risk of developing lung cancer (OR=1.955, 95% CI=1.213–3.157). The risk of developing lung cancer in the population with the CLPTM1L rs401681 locus carrying the T allele was 1.399 times that carrying the C allele (OR=1.343, 95% CI=1.035–1.978). The population with the TERT rs2736098 locus carrying the mutant genotype (CT+TT) was associated with the number of tumors (OR=0.553, 95% CI=0.236–0.928). In conclusion, in males, the TERT rs2736098 and CLPTM1L rs401681 T alleles are the susceptibility factors for developing lung cancer. Individuals, including the smoking population, who carry both the TERT rs2736098 and CLPTM1L rs401681 T alleles are more likely to develop lung cancer.
