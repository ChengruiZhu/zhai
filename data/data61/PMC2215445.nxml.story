After the offset of illumination, barnacle photoreceptors undergo a large hyperpolarization that lasts seconds or minutes. We studied the mechanisms that generate this afterpotential by recording afterpotentials intracellularly from the medial photoreceptors of the giant barnacle Balanus nubilus. The afterpotential has two components with different time-courses: (a) an earlier component due to an increase in conductance to K+ that is not blocked by extracellular tetraethylammonium ion (TEA+) or 3-aminopyridine (3-AP) and (b) a later component that is sensitive to cardiac glycosides and that requires extracellular K+, suggesting that it is due to an electrogenic Na+ pump. The K+ conductance component increases in amplitude with increasing CA++ concentration and is inhibited by extracellular Co++; the Co++ inhibition can be overcome by increasing the Ca++ concentration. Thus, the K+ conductance component is Ca++ dependent. An afterpotential similar to that evoked by a brief flash of light is generated by depolarization with current in the dark and by eliciting Ca++ action potentials in the presence of TEA+ in the soma, axon, or terminal regions of the photoreceptor. The action potential undershoot is generated by an increase in conductance to K+ that is resistant to TEA+ and 3-AP and inhibited by Co++. The similarity in time-course and pharmacology of the hyperpolarization afterpotentials elicited by (a) a brief flash of light, (b) depolarization with current, and (c) an action potential indicates that Ca++-dependent K+ channels throughout the photoreceptor membrane are responsible for all three hyperpolarizing events.
