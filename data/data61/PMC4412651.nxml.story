There is accumulating evidence that the transforming growth factor beta (TGF-β) and nuclear factor kappa-B (NFκB) pathways are tightly connected and play a key role in malignant transformation in cancer. Immune infiltration by regulatory T- and B-lymphocytes (Tregs, Bregs) has recently gained increased attention for being an important source of TGF-β. There is a plethora of studies examining the pro-tumorigenic functions of carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), but its receptor CEAR is far less studied. So far, there is a single connecting report that TGF-β also may signal through CEAR. The crosstalk between cancer tissues is further complicated by the expression of CEAR and TGF-β receptors in stromal cells, and implications of TGF-β in epithelial–mesenchymal transition. Furthermore, tumor-infiltrating Tregs and Bregs may directly instruct cancer cells by secreting TGF-β binding to their CEAR. Therefore, both TGF-β and CEA may act synergistically in breast cancer and cause disease progression, and NFκB could be a common crossing point between their signaling. CEAR, TGF-β1–3, TGF-β-R types I–III and NFκB class I and II molecules have an outstanding human–canine sequence identity, and only a canine CEA homolog has not yet been identified. For these reasons, the dog may be a valid translational model patient for investigating the crosstalk of the interconnected CEA and TGF-β networks.
