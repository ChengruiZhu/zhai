A new cell surface protein, podoendin, has been identified in Sprague- Dawley rats, and isolated using monoclonal antibody (mAb) G4. The distribution of podoendin is restricted to the surface of glomerular podocytes, urinary surface of the parietal epithelium of Bowman's capsule, and the luminal surface of endothelial cells. The antibody does not crossreact with podocytes or endothelia of human or mice. In newborn rats, the appearance of podoendin on glomerular epithelium is attendant on podocyte differentiation during glomerulogenesis of metanephrogenic vesicles. It disappears when podocytes retract and efface foot processes in tissue culture. Thus, podoendin appears to be a cell differentiation-dependent surface protein of podocytes. Podoendin is a protein of 62 kD mobility on 5% polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. It stains intensely with Coomassie blue, but gives negative reactions to carbohydrate (periodic acid/Schiff reaction) and polyanions (alcian blue, colloidal iron, and carbocyanine). It is distinct from the major sialoglycoprotein of podocyte fuzzy coat, podocalyxin (11). Podoendin isolated and purified from endothelium of lungs appears to be identical with that from podocytes and endothelium of kidneys. Injection of mAb G4 into left ventricle of rats resulted in intense decoration of the endothelium and podocyte surface within 30 min. The decoration persisted throughout the 3-d period of observation. This was not accompanied by complement (C3) fixation. Preliminary results showed that the rats developed moderate proteinuria (100 mg/ml protein in urine), which was associated with the presence of hyaline droplets in renal tubules, on the third day. The proteinuria was not accompanied by effacement of podocyte pedicels. There were no morphologic alterations indicating glomerular or vascular injury in the kidneys.
