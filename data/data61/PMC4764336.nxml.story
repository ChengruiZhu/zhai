As with any policy modelling, the accuracy of these findings depends on the evidence base, the quality of the data incorporated into the model, and the assumptions used. Limitations to the analysis here include that, due to an absence of evidence, the researchers have not examined the impact of any tax avoidance, which could potentially vary between the policies. The study findings suggest that in England (and probably in other countries) the introduction of strength-based taxation or minimum unit pricing would lead to larger reductions in health inequalities among heavy drinkers than an increase in the current tax rate or the introduction of value-based taxation. That is, the two policy options that target cheap, high-strength alcohol are likely to outperform value-based taxation and increasing the current UK tax in terms of reducing health inequalities. Thus, although these policies might be considered “regressive” (i.e., affecting the poor more than the rich) in terms of consumption and spending, they are at the same time “progressive” in that they reduce health inequalities. Finally, these findings suggest that minimum unit pricing and strength-based taxation, unlike the other two options tested, would target harmful drinking without unnecessarily penalizing people with low incomes who drink moderate amounts of alcohol.
