Titanium and titanium alloy are widely used as orthopedic implants for their favorable mechanical properties and satisfactory biocompatibility. The aim of the present study was to investigate the antibacterial effect and bone cell biocompatibility of a novel implant made with nanotubular anodized titanium coated with gentamicin (NTATi-G) through in vivo study in rabbits. The animals were divided into four groups, each receiving different kinds of implants, that is, NTATi-G, titanium coated with gentamicin (Ti-G), nanotubular anodized titanium uncoated with gentamicin (NTATi) and titanium uncoated with gentamicin (Ti). The results showed that NTATi-G implant prevented implant-related osteomyelitis and enhanced bone biocompatibility in vivo. Moreover, the body temperature of rabbits in NTATi-G and Ti-G groups was lower than those in Ti groups, while the weight of rabbits in NTATi-G and Ti-G groups was heavier than those in NTATi and Ti groups, respectively. White blood cell counts in NTATi-G group were lower than NTATi and Ti groups. Features of myelitis were observed by X-ray films in the NTATi and Ti groups, but not in the NTATi-G and Ti-G groups. The radiographic scores, which assessed pathology and histopathology in bone tissues, were significantly lower in the NTATi-G and Ti-G groups than those in the NTATi and Ti groups, respectively (
