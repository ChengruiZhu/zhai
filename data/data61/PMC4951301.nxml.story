Matrix metalloproteinases-9 (MMP-9) was one of the most important enzyme to breakdown extracellular matrix, aim to clarify the prognostic value of MMP-9 in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), we investigated the serum MMP-9 of NSCLC patients and performed a meta-analysis of the published literature. The expression and activity of serum MMP-9 were assessed by ELISA and gelatin zymography in 163 NSCLC patients. Moreover, 26 studies were included in meta-analysis by searching Medline and ISI Web of Knowledge. Our own data revealed high activity but not expression of MMP-9 significantly correlated with advanced T category and positive metastasis. In contrast, the meta-analysis revealed that increased MMP-9 level indicate high T category (RR = 0.83, 95% CI: 0.73-0.94), tumor stage (RR = 0.72, 95% CI: 0.63-0.82) and poor OS (5-year overall survival, RR = 1.32, 95% CI: 1.19-1.48). Moreover, stratified analysis based on sample types found that high MMP-9 expression in tissue specimen but not serum was significant correlated with advanced T category (RR = 0.81, 95% CI: 0.72-0.92), tumor stage (RR = 0.69, 95% CI: 0.60-0.80) and poor 5-year OS (1.33, 95% CI: 1.18-1.50). In conclusion, the activity of MMP-9 was positively correlated with advanced T category and distant metastasis. Moreover, the meta-analysis revealed that overexpression of MMP-9 in tissue but not in serum was a risk factor of advanced T category, tumor stage and poor outcome.
