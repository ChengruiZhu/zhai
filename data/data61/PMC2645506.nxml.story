Accessing the information encoded in DNA requires that RNA polymerases recognize the core promoter, a sequence that marks the start of a gene. Statistical analysis of known promoter sequences has failed to reveal a simple code for identifying promoters, leading to the suggestion that promoter DNA is distinguished by certain structural/dynamic properties encoded in nonobvious ways by the literal sequence. Because the DNA strands at the promoter need to be separated for transcription to begin, we previously proposed that promoter sequences exhibit a propensity for spontaneous strand separation. Here, we conduct simulations of the ultrafast, small-scale strand separation motions of eight mammalian promoters and show that start sites tend to form larger and more stable openings in the double helix compared to other sequences. Experimentally, we show that an artificial permanent opening in the double helix is sufficient for transcription in the absence of sequence-specific proteinâ€“DNA contacts. These findings support a view of DNA as a structurally active participant in gene expression, rather than the commonly envisioned passive digital storage device. Our analysis suggests that functionally relevant structural variation in genomic DNA occurs at the level of fast motions not readily observed by traditional molecular structure analysis.
