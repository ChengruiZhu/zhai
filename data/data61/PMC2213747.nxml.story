. To produce activation a current of rheobasic strength does not have to be applied for an infinite time but only for about 100 msec. (maximum utilization time). Activation becomes manifest some time after termination of the activating pulse. 6. With currents of slowly increasing strength it is possible to reach current strengths several times higher than rheobase without obtaining activation (accomodation). Accomodation to a large extent depends on the variety of iron used. Details are given for currents increasing with a time constant of 0.5 second. 7. Potential measurements on wires in the refractory state show the existence of after potentials. Wires in the refractory state which are cathodically polarized show peculiar oscillograms. Both types of experiments point to the formation of nitrous acid as an essential element in the course of events. 8. With current densities only slightly above rheobase all wires exhibit simple activations only. With higher current densities certain types of wires exhibit periodic activations. The range of current densities in which such periodic activations occur varies with the type of wire. The lower limit is sometimes quite close to the rheobase. 9. A theory of periodic activations is presented which is modelled on the theory of self-excitatory electrical oscillations. As variables describing the state of the wire, the "degree of activation" and the "degree of refractoriness" are introduced. In the physicochemical system an autocatalytic process corresponds to the "falling characteristic" of electrical oscillations. The theory leads to a rational view of the interrelations between threshold, rheobase, accomodafion, refractoriness, and rhythm. The phenomena of conduction are not discussed here but their relation to the theory is briefly touched upon.
