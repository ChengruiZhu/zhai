Fibrosing cholestatic hepatitis (FCH) is an aggressive form of hepatitis C virus (HCV) recurrence after orthotopic liver transplantation (OLT), which frequently results in graft failure and death. Treatment of FCH remains challenging, and the optimal antiviral therapy is yet to be determined. Between November 2013 and early 2015, 62 patients with HCV cirrhosis underwent OLT at our transplant center, of whom, 5 patients developed recurrence HCV in the form of severe FCH and were treated with sofosbuvir and simeprevir (SOF-SMV) for 24 weeks. All patients achieved significant improvement of HCV viral load and had undetectable viral PCR at 6â€“8 week of treatment. The HCV RNA remained undetectable throughout treatment course. The first two patients achieved SVR at week 12 after completion of the treatment. There were significant histologic and biomarkers improvements after initiation of the treatment. One patient developed refractory pruritus and acute pancreatitis. The second, fourth and fifth patients had very benign treatment courses with no side effects recorded. The third patient was starting the treatment with multiple comorbid conditions. His course was complicated with hepatic artery thrombosis, and later developed sepsis and renal failure. Therefore, it seems that the combination of SOF-SMV is an efficacious oral regimen in OLT recipient with recurrent hepatitis C and FCH. However, safety profile needs to be carefully evaluated.
