Ovarian cancer is the most fatal gynecological cancer, with a 5-year survival rate of only 30%. Lysophosphatidic acid (LPA), which possesses growth factor-like functions, is a major regulatory factor in the peritoneal metastasis of ovarian cancer. LPA stimulates the expression of numerous genes that are associated with angiogenesis and metastasis. Ovarian epithelial carcinoma specifically expresses chemotactic factor C-X-C motif chemokine ligand 12 (CXCL12) and its receptor, CXC receptor 4 (CXCR4). The CXCL12-CXCR4 axis directly contributes to ovarian cancer cell proliferation, migration and invasion. The present study investigated the regulation of LPA on the CXCL12-CXCR4 axis and the effect of the LPA-mediated CXCL12-CXCR4 axis on the tumor proliferation, migration and invasion of ovarian cancer cell lines. The CXCR4 proteins expressed in the cell membrane and the cytoplasm of ovarian cancer cells, CAOV3 and SKOV3, were detected by immunocytochemistry. The expression of CXCR4 and CXCL12 was increased in the ovarian cancer cells in a dose- and time-dependent manner when treated with LPA compared with the control groups (P<0.05), as determined by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction and flow cytometry. LPA (20 Î¼M) and CXCL12 (100 ng/ml) enhanced the proliferation, migration and invasion of the ovarian cancer cells, CAOV3 and SKOV3, as identified by MTT, Transwell and Matrigel assays following co-treatment for 24 h. LPA promoted invasiveness of ovarian cancer by upregulating CXCL12-CXCR4 axis expression.
