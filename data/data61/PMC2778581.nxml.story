Thrombospondins (TSPs) -1 and -2 were among the first protein inhibitors of angiogenesis to be identified, a property that was subsequently attributed to the interactions of sequences in their type I repeats with endothelial cell-surface receptors. The interactions of TSPs-1 and -2 with cell-surface receptors, proteases, growth factors, and other bioactive molecules, coupled with the absence of direct structural functions that can be attributed to these matrix proteins, qualify them for inclusion in the category of ‘matricellular proteins’. The phenotypes of TSP-1, TSP-2, and double TSP-1/2-null mice confirm the roles that these proteins play in the regulation of angiogenesis, and provide clues to some of the other important functions of these multi-domain proteins. One of these functions is the ability of TSP-1 to activate the latent TGFβ1 complex, a property that is not shared by TSP-2. A major pathway by which TSP1 or TSP2 inhibits angiogenesis involves an interaction with CD 36 on endothelial cells, which leads to apoptosis of both the liganded and adjacent cells. However a homeostatic mechanism, which inhibits endothelial cell proliferation, and may be physiologically preferable under some circumstances, has also been elucidated, and involves interaction with the very low density lipoprotein receptor (VLDLR). The interaction of TSP1with its receptor, CD47, further inhibits angiogenesis by antagonizing nitric oxide signaling in endothelial and vascular smooth muscle cells. Paradoxically, there is also evidence that TSP-1 can function to promote angiogenesis. This apparent contradiction can be explained by the presence of sequences in different domains of the protein that interact with different receptors on endothelial cells. The anti-angiogenic function of TSPs has spurred interest in their use as anti-tumor agents. Currently, peptide mimetics, based on sequences in the type I repeats of TSPs that have been shown to have anti-angiogenic properties, are undergoing clinical testing.
