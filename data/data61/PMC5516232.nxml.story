 receptors in clinical development for the treatment of chronic immune‐mediated, inflammatory diseases. This first‐in‐human study characterized the safety, pharmacokinetics (PK), and pharmacodynamics (PD) of ozanimod in 88 healthy volunteers using a range of single and multiple doses (7 and 28 days) and a dose‐escalation regimen. Ozanimod was generally well tolerated up to a maximum single dose of 3 mg and multiple doses of 2 mg/d, with no severe adverse events (AEs) and no dose‐limiting toxicities. The most common ozanimod‐related AEs included headache, somnolence, dizziness, nausea, and fatigue. Ozanimod exhibited linear PK, high steady‐state volume of distribution (73–101 L/kg), moderate oral clearance (204–227 L/h), and an elimination half‐life of approximately 17 to 21 hours. Ozanimod produced a robust dose‐dependent reduction in total peripheral lymphocytes, with a median decrease of 65% to 68% observed after 28 days of dosing at 1 and 1.5 mg/d, respectively. Ozanimod selectivity affected lymphocyte subtypes, causing marked decreases in cells expressing CCR7 and variable decreases in subsets lacking CCR7. A dose‐dependent negative chronotropic effect was observed following the first dose, with the dose‐escalation regimen attenuating the first‐dose negative chronotropic effect. Ozanimod safety, PK, and PD properties support the once‐daily regimens under clinical investigation.
