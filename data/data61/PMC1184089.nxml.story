Somatostatin (SST) inhibition of hormone hypersecretion from tumors is mediated by somatostatin receptors (SSTRs). SSTRs also play an important role in controlling tumor growth through specific antiproliferative actions. These receptors are well expressed in numerous normal and tumor tissues and are susceptible to regulation by a variety of factors. Estradiol, a potent trophic and mitogenic hormone in its target tissues, is known to modulate the expression of SST and its receptors. Accordingly, in the present study, we determined the effects of tamoxifen, a selective estrogen receptor (ER) modulator (SERM), and estradiol on SSTR1 and SSTR2 expression at the mRNA and protein levels in ER-positive and -negative breast cancer cells. We found that SSTR1 was upregulated by tamoxifen in a dose-dependent manner but no effect was seen with estradiol. In contrast, SSTR2 was upregulated by both tamoxifen and estradiol. Combined treatment caused suppression of SSTR1 below control levels but had no significant effect on SSTR2. Treatment with SSTR1-specific agonist was significantly more effective in suppressing cell proliferation of cells pre-treated with tamoxifen. Taking these data into consideration, we suggest that tamoxifen and estradiol exert variable effects on SSTR1 and SSTR2 mRNA and protein expression and distributional pattern of the receptors. These changes are cell subtype-specific and affect the ability of SSTR agonists to inhibit cell proliferation.
