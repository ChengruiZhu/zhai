A key step in the regulation of mammalian genes is the splicing of the messenger RNA precursor to produce a mature mRNA that can be translated into a particular protein needed by the cell. Through the process of alternative splicing, mRNAs encoding different proteins can be derived from the same primary gene transcript. The regulation of this process plays essential roles in the development of differentiated tissues and is mediated by special pre-mRNA binding proteins. To understand how these proteins control gene expression, one must characterize what they recognize in RNA and identify these binding sites across the genome in order to predict their targets. Models that allow this prediction are essential to understanding developmental regulatory programs and their perturbation by disease causing mutations. In this study, we use statistical methods to build models of RNA recognition by the important splicing regulator PTBP1 and then apply these models to predict PTBP1 regulation of new gene transcripts. We show that PTBP1 has different specificity for RNA than was previously recognized and that its target exons are more diverse than was known before. There are many similar splicing regulators in mammalian cells, and these analyses provide a general framework for the computational analysis of their RNA binding and target identification.
