The mean BMI was 24.4 [±7.3SD] in the pooled countries, being as low as 20.8 [±8.0 SD] in India to 23.4 [±6.3 SD] in Ghana, 23.9 [±4.9 SD] in China, 28.4 [±5.4 SD] in Mexico, 28.6 [±6.3 SD] in Russia, to as high as 30.5 [±12.0 SD] in South Africa. The prevalence of overweight was 13% and obesity was 24% in the pooled sample. The prevalence of non communicable disease multimorbidity was 23% in the pooled sample of six countries–the highest being in Russia (50%), followed by Mexico (27%), India (24%), Ghana (23%), South Africa (32%) and China (22%). The prevalence of multimorbidity was 37% among obese population and 27% among overweight population in the pooled sample–highest prevalence was in Russia (59% among obese; 45% among overweight) and lowest in Ghana (28% among obese; 23% among overweight). Being obese (OR:5.78;95%CI:3.55–9.40;p<0.0001) was associated with significantly higher likelihood of having multimorbidity as compared to normal weight category in the pooled sample. The likelihood of multimorbidity among obese were almost ten times higher in Russia (OR:9.90;95%CI:3.90–25.17;p=<0.0001), seven times higher in China (OR:7.06;95%CI:2.47–20.21;p=0.003), six times higher in Ghana (OR:5.61;95%CI:1.21–26.02;p= 0.007) and five times higher in South Africa (OR:4.66;95%CI:2.16–10.08;p=0.005). Non-significant but positive association were also observed in case of India and Mexico. The likelihood of multimorbidity was more than two times higher among overweight population in India (OR:2.33;95%CI:1.35–4.02;p=0.003) and pooled countries (OR:1.47;95%CI:1.05–2.07;p=0.004) while non-significant but positive association were also observed in case of China, Russia, and Ghana.
