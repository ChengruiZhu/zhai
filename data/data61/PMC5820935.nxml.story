 IE. Recent studies indicate that SAgs act at the infection site to cause tissue pathology and promote vegetation growth. The underlying mechanism of SAg involvement has not been clearly defined. In SAg-mediated responses, immune cell priming is considered a primary triggering event leading to endothelial cell activation and altered function. Utilizing immortalized human aortic endothelial cells (iHAECs), we demonstrated that TSST-1 directly activates iHAECs, as documented by upregulation of vascular and intercellular adhesion molecules (VCAM-1 and ICAM-1). TSST-1-mediated activation results in increased monolayer permeability and defects in vascular reendothelialization. Yet stimulation of iHAECs with TSST-1 fails to induce interleukin-8 (IL-8) and IL-6 production. Furthermore, simultaneous stimulation of iHAECs with TSST-1 and lipopolysaccharide (LPS) inhibits LPS-mediated IL-8 and IL-6 secretion, even after pretreatment with either of the proinflammatory cytokines tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) and IL-1β. IL-8 suppression is not mediated by TSST-1 binding to its canonical receptor major histocompatibility complex class II (MHC-II), supporting current evidence for a nonhematopoietic interacting site on SAgs. Together, the data suggest that TSST-1 differentially regulates cell-bound and secreted markers of endothelial cell activation that may result in dysregulated innate immune responses during
