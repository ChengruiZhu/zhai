Gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs) of the stomach presenting as an intra-abdominal abscess are extremely rare. We herein report a case that underwent successful laparoscopic resection of gastric GIST presenting with an intra-abdominal abscess. A 70-year-old man presented with a 3-day history of acute upper abdominal pain with a fever. Laboratory data showed an elevated white blood cell count and C-reactive protein level. A CT scan revealed a mass of mixed solid and fluid components, measuring 5.5 cm, in the adjacent lesser curvature of the stomach. He was diagnosed as having an intra-abdominal abscess, and antibiotic therapy was administered. Consequently, his symptoms were relieved and a CT scan on the 7th day showed that the mass reduced and became homogenous. According to the results of a fine-needle aspiration biopsy, the tumor was suspected to be a GIST. Laparoscopic surgery with the 5-port approach was performed. The tumor existed in the lesser curvature of the stomach, and was excised en bloc with the omentum and gastric wall by wedge resection. The tumor measured 3.0 cm in diameter and originated from the serosal layer of the stomach. Histological findings showed spindle cells with a stromal growth pattern that was positive for c-kit (CD 117) and CD 34. The postoperative course was uneventful, and no recurrence has been noted in the 2 years since the operation. This is the first report of a case with gastric GIST with an intra-abdominal abscess that was successfully treated by laparoscopic surgery.
