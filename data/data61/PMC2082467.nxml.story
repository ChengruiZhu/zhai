Arsenic is an environmental pollutant and known human carcinogen. Chronic exposure to arsenic-contaminated water is an important public health hazard around the world, including the United States, with millions exposed to drinking water with levels that far exceed World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines. Given the implications of prenatal exposure on human health and the known public health hazard of chronic arsenic exposure, this study was aimed at establishing the extent to which maternal arsenic exposure in a human population affects newborn gene expression. The authors show that prenatal arsenic exposure in a human population results in alarming gene expression changes in newborn babies. The gene expression changes monitored in babies born to mothers exposed to arsenic during pregnancy are highly predictive of prenatal arsenic exposure in a subsequent test population. The study establishes a subset of just 11 transcripts that captured maximal predictive capability that could prove promising as genetic biomarkers of prenatal arsenic exposure. Pathway analysis of the genome-wide response in the babies exposed to arsenic in utero indicates robust activation of an integrated network of pathways involving NF-ÎºB, inflammation, cell proliferation, stress, and apoptosis. This study contributes to our understanding of biological responses to arsenic exposure.
