Integrative veterinary medicine (IVM) describes the combination of complementary and
alternative therapies with conventional care and is guided by the best available
evidence. Veterinarians frequently encounter questions about complementary and
alternative veterinary medicine (CAVM) in practice, and the general public has
demonstrated increased interest in these areas for both human and animal health.
Consequently, veterinary students should receive adequate exposure to the principles,
theories, and current knowledge supporting or refuting such techniques. A proposed
curriculum guideline would broadly introduce students to the objective evaluation of
new veterinary treatments while increasing their preparation for responding to
questions about IVM in clinical practice. Such a course should be evidence-based,
unbiased, and unaffiliated with any particular CAVM advocacy or training group. All
IVM courses require routine updating as new information becomes available.
Controversies regarding IVM and CAVM must be addressed within the course and
throughout the entire curriculum. Instructional honesty regarding the uncertainties
in this emerging field is critical. Increased training of future veterinary
professionals in IVM may produce an openness to new ideas that characterizes the
scientific method and a willingness to pursue and incorporate evidence-based medicine
in clinical practice with all therapies, including those presently regarded as
integrative, complementary, or alternative.
