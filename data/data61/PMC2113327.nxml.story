A heat shock-resistant mutant of the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae was isolated at the mutation frequency of 10(-7) from a culture treated with ethyl methane sulfonate. Cells of the mutant are approximately 1,000-fold more resistant to lethal heat shock than those of the parental strain. Tetrad analysis indicates that phenotypes revealed by this mutant segregated together in the ratio 2+:2- from heterozygotes constructed with the wild-type strain of the opposite mating type, and are, therefore, attributed to a single nuclear mutation. The mutated gene in the mutant was herein designated hsr1 (heat shock response). The hsr1 allele is recessive to the HSR1+ allele of the wild-type strain. Exponentially growing cells of hsr1 mutant were found to constitutively synthesize six proteins that are not synthesized or are synthesized at reduced rates in HSR1+ cells unless appropriately induced. These proteins include one hsp/G0-protein (hsp48A), one hsp (hsp48B), and two G0-proteins (p73, p56). Heterozygous diploid (hsr1/HSR1+) cells do not synthesize the proteins constitutively induced in hsr1 cells, which suggests that the product of the HSR1 gene might negatively regulate the synthesis of these proteins. The hsr1 mutation also led to altered growth of the mutant cells. The mutation elongated the duration of G1 period in the cell cycle and affected both growth arrest by sulfur starvation and growth recovery from it. We discuss the problem of which protein(s) among those constitutively expressed in growing cells of the hsr1 mutant is responsible for heat shock resistance and alterations in the growth control.
