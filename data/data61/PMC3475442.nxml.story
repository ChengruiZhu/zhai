Human EnSC (endometrial-derived stem cell) is an abundant and easily available source for cell replacement therapy. Many investigations have shown the potency of the cells to differentiate into several mesoderm-derived cell lineages, including osteocytes and adipocytes. Here, the potency of EnSC in neural differentiation has been investigated. Flow cytometric analysis showed that they were positive for CD90, CD105, OCT4, CD44 and negative for CD31, CD34, CD133. The characterized cells were induced into neural differentiation by bFGF (basic fibroblast growth factor), PDGF (platelet-derived growth factor) and EGF (epidermal growth factor) signalling molecules, respectively in a sequential protocol, and differentiated cells were analysed for expression of neuronal markers by RT–PCR (reverse transcription–PCR) and immunocytochemistry, including Nestin, GABA (γ-aminobutyric acid), MAP2 (microtubule-associated protein 2), β3-tub (class III β-tubulin) and NF-L (neurofilament-light) at the level of their mRNAs. The expression of MAP2, β3-tub and NF-L proteins in EnSC was confirmed 28 days PT (post-treatment) by immunocytochemistry. In conclusion, EnSC can respond to signalling molecules that are usually used as standards in neural differentiation and can programme neuronal cells, making these cells worth considering as a unique source for cell therapy in neurodegenerative disease.
