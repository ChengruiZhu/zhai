The aim of the present study was to investigate the relationship between the expression of transcription factor forkhead box C2 (FOXC2) and the clinical features of cervical cancer. A total of 66 patients with cervical cancer, 42 patients with cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) and 25 patients with cervical inflammation were enrolled. The positive expression rates and expression levels of mRNA of FOXC2, E-cadherin, N-cadherin, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), stromal cell-derived factor-1 (SDF-1), Notch protein and lymphatic vessel endothelial hyaluronan receptor-1 (LYVE-1) in cervical tissues were detected using immunohistochemistry and RT-PCR. The positive expression rates and expression levels of mRNA of FOXC2, N-cadherin, VEGF, SDF-1, Notch and LYVE-1 in cervical cancer were significantly higher than those in CIN, and those in the inflammatory tissues were the lowest, while the positive expression rate of E-cadherin in cervical cancer was lower than that in CIN, and that in the inflammatory tissues was the highest (P<0.05). The positive expression rates of FOXC2, N-cadherin, VEGF, SDF-1, Notch and LYVE-1 in patients with cervical cancer [human papillomavirus (HPV) positive, squamous cell carcinoma, Stages III–IV, maximal diameter ≥3.8 cm and low differentiation] were increased, and the positive expression rate of E-cadherin was decreased (P<0.05). Correlation analysis revealed that FOXC2 was positively correlated with the positive expression rates of N-cadherin, VEGF, SDF-1, Notch and LYVE-1, and negatively correlated with E-cadherin (P<0.05). In conclusion, the high expression of FOXC2 is correlated with the HPV infection, pathological pattern, clinical stage, tumor diameter and differentiation grade of cervical cancer, which may be involved in the epithelial-mesenchymal transition, vascular and matrix formation, Notch signaling pathway and lymphangiogenesis.
