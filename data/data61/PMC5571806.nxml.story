Grazing-incidence small-angle X-ray scattering (GISAXS) is often used as a versatile tool for the contactless and destruction-free investigation of nano­structured surfaces. However, due to the shallow incidence angles, the footprint of the X-ray beam is significantly elongated, limiting GISAXS to samples with typical target lengths of several millimetres. For many potential applications, the production of large target areas is impractical, and the targets are surrounded by structured areas. Because the beam footprint is larger than the targets, the surrounding structures contribute parasitic scattering, burying the target signal. In this paper, GISAXS measurements of isolated as well as surrounded grating targets in Si substrates with line lengths from 50 µm down to 4 µm are presented. For the isolated grating targets, the changes in the scattering patterns due to the reduced target length are explained. For the surrounded grating targets, the scattering signal of a 15 µm × 15 µm target grating structure is separated from the scattering signal of 100 µm × 100 µm nanostructured surroundings by producing the target with a different orientation with respect to the predominant direction of the surrounding structures. As virtually all litho­graphically produced nanostructures have a predominant direction, the described technique allows GISAXS to be applied in a range of applications,
