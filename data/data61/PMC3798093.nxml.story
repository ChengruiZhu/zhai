Vitamin E (VE) has been added to ultrahigh-molecular-weight polyethylene (UHMWPE) acetabular cups and tibial trays primarily to reduce oxidative damage to the polymer. The aim of this study was to investigate the relative wear rates of UHMWPE-containing VE compared with virgin UHMWPE. The ability of VE to reduce the amount of inflammatory cytokines produced from stimulated peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMNCs) was also investigated. Stimulation was achieved by exposure of PBMNCs to either lipoplysaccharide (LPS) or VE-containing UHMWPE (VE-UHMWPE). In the present study, results showed that the wear rates of UHMWPE with or without VE were not significantly different. Particles generated by UHMWPE with and without VE were not significantly different in size distribution. The production of osteolytic mediators, tumor necrosis factor-alpha, interleukin 1β (IL-β), IL-6, and IL-8 were significantly reduced in (PBMNCs) stimulated with either LPS + VE compared with LPS or VE-UHMWPE particles compared to virgin UHMWPE particles. This trend was also observed when VE was added as a liquid to UHMWPE wear particle-stimulated PBMNCs. The exact mechanism of how VE affects the release of inflammatory mediators from particle-stimulated macrophages is not yet understood. It is likely to involve the anti-inflammatory and/or antioxidant effects of VE.
