The article presents the results of fluorescence analyses of 2-methylamino-5-(2,4-dihydroxyphenyl)-1,3,4-thiadiazole (MDFT) in an aqueous environment. MDFT dissolved in aqueous solutions with a pH value in the range from 1 to 4.5 yielded an interesting effect of two clearly separated fluorescence emissions. In turn, a single fluorescence was observed in MDFT dissolved in water solutions with a pH value from 4.5 to 12. As it was suggested in the previous investigations of other 1,3,4-thiadiazole compounds, these effects may be associated with conformational changes in the structure of the analysed molecule accompanied by aggregation effects. Crystallographic data showed that the effect of the two separated fluorescence emissions occurred in a conformation with the â€“OH group in the resorcyl ring bound on the side of the sulphur atom from the 1,3,4-thiadiazole ring. The hypothesis of aggregation as the mechanism involved in the change in the spectral properties at low pH is supported by the results of (Time-Dependent) Density Functional Theory calculations. The possibility of rapid analysis of conformational changes with the fluorescence spectroscopy technique may be rather important outcome obtained from the spectroscopic studies presented in this article. Additionally, the presented results seem to be highly important as they can be easily observed in solutions and biologically important samples.
