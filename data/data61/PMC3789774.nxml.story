The adult human brain consumes more than 20% of the resting metabolism. With ∼19–23 billion neurons, the cerebral cortex consumes much of this energy, mainly to restore ion gradients across membranes for electrical signaling. Even small increases in the average spike rate of cortical neurons could cause the cortex to exceed the energy available for the whole brain. Consequently, the cortex is likely to be under considerable selective pressure to reduce spike rates but, given its important roles in behavior, to maintain information processing. Numerous experimental studies have shown that excitatory and inhibitory synaptic currents are balanced in cortical neurons. Could this feature of cortical neurons contribute to their efficiency? We tested this by making comparisons among computational models with different amounts of inhibition and excitation: excitation only, equal excitation and inhibition (balanced synaptic conductances), and more inhibition than excitation (balanced synaptic currents). Our simulations show that computational models with balanced synaptic currents have similar information rates to the other regimes but achieve this with fewer, more informative spikes that consume less energy. Therefore, in comparison to other synaptic regimes, balanced synaptic currents have the highest coding efficiency and the highest energy efficiency.
