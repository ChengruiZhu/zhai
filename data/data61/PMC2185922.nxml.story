B10 (H-2b) mice are genetic nonresponders to hen egg-white lysozyme (HEL) and the distantly related human lysozyme (HUL). However, anti-HEL or anti-HUL primary antibody responses in vivo or in vitro can be obtained in B10 mice by immunization with the appropriate lysozyme coupled to erythrocytes. T cells able to suppress either anti-lysozyme plaque-forming cells (PFC) response are induced in B10 mice after immunization with HEL-complete Freund's adjuvant (CFA) or HUL-CFA. This cross-reactivity of HEL and HUL in the induction and the expression of suppressive activity is in marked contrast to their very low cross- reactivity at the PFC level. These results suggest that either HEL or HUL can stimulate a suppressor T cell which recognizes a particular epitope present on both lysozymes. Suppressor cells induced by HEL or HUL bear the same predominant idiotype found on the majority of anti- HEL antibodies, and on the small proportion of anti-HUL antibodies cross-reactive with HEL. B10.Q (H-2q) mice are responders in vivo to HEL-CFA, but not to HUL-CFA. In contrast to B10, HEL-CFA priming in B10.Q micr induces helper cells whereas HUL-CFA priming induces suppressor cells. These suppressor cells are cross-reactive with HEL and are fully able to suppress HEL-specific helper cells. The presence of HEL-specific suppressor cell precursors in B10.Q mice which are not activated by HEL, seems to implicate differential choice by the antigen presenting system as a basis for Ir gene control, rather than the absence of a regulatory cell type from the T cell repertoire.
