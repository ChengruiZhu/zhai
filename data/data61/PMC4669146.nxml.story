In the brain areas responsible for sensory processing, neurons learn over time to respond to specific features in the external world. Here, we propose a new, biologically plausible model for how groups of neurons can learn which specific features to respond to. Our work connects theoretical arguments about the optimal forms of neuronal representations with experimental results showing how synaptic connections change in response to neuronal activity. Specifically, we show that biologically realistic neurons can implement an algorithm known as autoencoder learning, in which the neurons learn to form representations that can be used to reconstruct their inputs. Autoencoder networks can successfully model neuronal responses in early sensory areas, and they are also frequently used in machine learning for training deep neural networks. Despite their power and utility, autoencoder networks have not been previously implemented in a fully biological fashion. To perform the autoencoder algorithm, neurons must modify their incoming, feedforward synaptic connections as well as their outgoing, feedback synaptic connectionsâ€”and the changes to both must depend on the errors the network makes when it tries to reconstruct its input. Here, we propose a model for activity in the network and show that the commonly used spike-timing-dependent plasticity paradigm will implement the desired changes to feedforward synaptic connection weights. Critically, we use recent experimental evidence to propose that feedback connections learn according to a temporally reversed plasticity rule. We show mathematically that the two rules combined can approximately implement autoencoder learning, and confirm our results using simulated networks of integrate-and-fire neurons. By showing that biological neurons can implement this powerful algorithm, our work opens the door for the modeling of many learning paradigms from both the fields of computational neuroscience and machine learning.
