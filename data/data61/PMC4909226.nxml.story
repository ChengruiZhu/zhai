Current identification of driver cancer genes is limited by the statistical resolution of existing approaches. However, many rare mutations that contribute to cancer progression remain unidentified. We capitalize on the powerful insight that our knowledge of genetic variants in inherited diseases can enhance driver oncogene identification. Inherited disease variants are unique because they have known pathogenicity, validated causality, and resolution at the level of individual amino acids. Because of this, it is commonly argued, that overlapping mutations between a given inherited disease dataset and human cancer are important by virtue of the fact that they occur in both places. However, this argument never takes into account how often a discovered mutant would overlap with the cancer exome by chance. We find that chance overlap of variants happens surprisingly often. To exclude this effect, we rigorously estimate how often overlap can occur by chance. Beyond the discovery of new cancer-associated genes, we independently validate our predictions with experiments, structural analysis, and epidemiological data. Finally, our ability to rigorously link drivers across diseases has the potential to create a social benefit by bridging the treatment of rare inherited diseases and the treatment of rare cancers. This holds the potential to enhance patient access to new medicines by making orphan diseases a little more common and identifying larger unmet medical needs.
