Ion mobility-mass spectrometry measurements
which describe the
gas-phase scaling of molecular size and mass are of both fundamental
and pragmatic utility. Fundamentally, such measurements expand our
understanding of intrinsic intramolecular folding forces in the absence
of solvent. Practically, reproducible transport properties, such as
gas-phase collision cross-section (CCS), are analytically useful metrics
for identification and characterization purposes. Here, we report
594 CCS values obtained in nitrogen drift gas on an electrostatic
drift tube ion mobility-mass spectrometry (IM-MS) instrument. The
instrument platform is a newly developed prototype incorporating a
uniform-field drift tube bracketed by electrodynamic ion funnels and
coupled to a high resolution quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometer.
The CCS values reported here are of high experimental precision (±0.5%
or better) and represent four chemically distinct classes of molecules
(quaternary ammonium salts, lipids, peptides, and carbohydrates),
which enables structural comparisons to be made between molecules
of different chemical compositions for the rapid “omni-omic”
characterization of complex biological samples. Comparisons made between
helium and nitrogen-derived CCS measurements demonstrate that nitrogen
CCS values are systematically larger than helium values; however,
general separation trends between chemical classes are retained regardless
of the drift gas. These results underscore that, for the highest CCS
accuracy, care must be exercised when utilizing helium-derived CCS
values to calibrate measurements obtained in nitrogen, as is the common
practice in the field.
