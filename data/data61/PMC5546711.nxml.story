Neurons communicate through specialized sites of cell–cell contact known as synapses. This vast set of connections is believed to be crucial for sensory processing, motor function, learning and memory. Experimental data from recent years suggest that synapses are not static structures, but rather dynamic assemblies of molecules that move in, out and between nearby synapses, with these dynamics driving changes in synaptic properties over time. Thus, in addition to changes directed by activity or other physiological signals, synapses also exhibit spontaneous changes that have particular dynamical and statistical signatures. Given the immense complexity of synapses at the molecular scale, how can one hope to understand the principles that govern these spontaneous changes and statistical signatures? Here we offer a mesoscopic modelling approach—situated between detailed microscopic and abstract macroscopic approaches—to advance this understanding. Our model, based on simplified biophysical assumptions, shows that spontaneous cooperative binding and unbinding of proteins at synaptic sites can give rise to dynamic and statistical signatures similar to those measured in experiments. Importantly, we find cooperativity to be indispensable in this regard. Our model thus offers a conceptual understanding of synaptic dynamics and statistical features in terms of a fundamental biological principle, namely cooperativity.
