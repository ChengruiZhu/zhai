In sexually reproducing organisms, meiosis divides the number of chromosomes by half to generate gametes. Meiosis involves a series of interactions between maternal and paternal chromosomes leading to the exchange of genetic material by recombination. Completion of these processes is required for accurate distribution of chromosomes to the gametes. Meiotic cells possess quality-control mechanisms (checkpoints) to monitor those critical events. When failures occur, the checkpoint blocks meiotic progression to prevent the formation of aneuploid gametes. Genetic information is packaged into chromatin; histone modifications regulate multiple aspects of DNA metabolism to maintain genomic integrity. Dot1 is a conserved methyltransferase, responsible for histone H3 methylation at lysine 79, that is required for the meiotic recombination checkpoint. Here we decipher the molecular mechanism underlying Dot1 meiotic checkpoint function. We show that Dot1 catalytic activity correlates with the strength of the checkpoint response. By regulating Pch2 chromatin distribution, Dot1 controls localization of the chromosome axial component Hop1, which, in turn, contributes to activation of Mek1, the major effector kinase of the checkpoint. Our findings suggest that, in response to meiotic defects, the chromatin environment created by a constitutive histone mark orchestrates distribution of structural components of the chromosomes supporting activation of the meiotic checkpoint.
