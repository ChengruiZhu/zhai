 Corpus luteum formation was induced in 26-day-old rats which were subsequently hypophysectomized and injected with mammotrophic hormone (MH, LTH). Sections of corpora lutea from these animals were examined with the electron microscope and compared with similarly prepared (Caulfield's fixed, Araldite embedded) corpora from normal pregnancy and from controls, the latter consisting of corpora prior to hypophysectomy and corpora from uninjected rats 7 to 14 days after hypophysectomy. Lutein cells from corpora lutea of injected animals and of normal pregnancy are characterized by abundant, tortuous, tubular agranular endoplasmic reticulum and by mitochondria, many of which are disc-shaped with dense matrices and both villiform and lamelliform cristae. The endoplasmic reticulum is most abundant in lutein cells from pregnant animals, in which cells it is in the form of thin, highly tortuous tubules. The form of the lipid droplets seen in cells of stimulated animals varies greatly. Marginal foldings of the lutein cells on the perivascular space were found in all instances. Lutein cells from hypophysectomized animals have a less highly developed agranular endoplasmic reticulum. The mitochondria have irregular outlines and a relatively lucid matrix. The lipid droplets in these cells show less tendency to be extracted, but are not so large or abundant as in the cells of onset controls. Granules believed to contain lipid pigments are common in the lutein cells of these control animals. It is suggested that lutein cells from corpora lutea which are actively secreting progesterone may be readily distinguished from lutein cells from non-active corpora by means of the multiple characteristics enumerated. It is further suggested that mammotrophic hormone has a general effect on the metabolism of lutein cells rather than solely affecting a specific organelle, the abundance or composition of which may be the limiting factor in the production of progesterone.
