Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is the most common type of lung cancer, which is the leading cancer killer in the world. Despite the recent advances in its diagnosis and therapy, the prognosis of NSCLC patients remains very poor, mainly due to the development of drug resistance and metastasis. Both the chemokine network and the matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) system play important roles in cancer cell metastasis. The disruption of CCL2/CCR2 chemokine signaling has been shown to suppress cancer cellviability and metastasis. CCL2-neutralizing antibodies, which have shown promising therapeutic efficacy in several cancer models, are not widely used due to technical issues. CCR2 antagonism has thus become an alternative method for cancer treatment. However, the effect of CCR2 antagonists on NSCLC progression remains poorly understood. Here, we investigated the effect of CCR2 antagonist (CAS445479-97-0) on the proliferation, migration and invasion of human lung adenocarcinoma A549 cells by using WST-1 cell viability assay, transwell migration assay, wound healing scratch assay and Matrigel invasion assay. We demonstrated that CCL2 treatment promoted A549 cell viability, motility and invasion by upregulating MMP-9 expression and that this induction was significantly suppressed by CAS 445479-97-0. Taken together, our data suggested that the CCR2 antagonist would be a potential drug for treating CCR2-positive NSCLC patients.
