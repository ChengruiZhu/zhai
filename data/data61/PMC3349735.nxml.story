One of the major outstanding questions in eukaryotic gene regulation is how transcription factors with seemingly very similar DNA binding specificities elicit specific biological responses. The ETS transcription factor family provides a paradigm for investigating this phenomenon. Here, we have focused on the ETS transcription factor ELK1, and by combining genome-wide binding analysis coupled with gene expression analysis we have dissected two distinct gene regulatory activities for this transcription factor. In each of these regulatory modes, ELK1 exhibits distinct DNA binding characteristics which correlate with either positive or negative transcriptional activities and give rise to functionally distinct gene expression programmes. We demonstrate a novel function for ELK1 in controlling cell migration through one of these regulatory modes. Thus, we have demonstrated a clear link between the types of regulatory region bound by a transcription factor and its ability to control gene expression (i.e. in a positive or negative manner) and the functional downstream consequences of its target gene cohort. This work has implications for understanding how members of other multi-protein transcription factor families might function to generate different downstream functional consequences through engaging with different types of regulatory regions.
