 In some living cells the order of penetration of certain cations corresponds to that of their mobilities in water. This has led to the idea that electrolytes pass chiefly as ions through the protoplasmic surface in which the order of ionic mobilities is supposed to correspond to that found in water. If this correspondence could be demonstrated it would not prove that electrolytes pass chiefly as ions through the protoplasmic surface for such a correspondence could exist if the movement were mostly in molecular form. This is clearly shown in the models here described. In these the protoplasmic surface is represented by a non-aqueous layer interposed between two aqueous phases, one representing the external solution, the other the cell sap. The order of penetration through the non-aqueous layer is Cs > Rb > K > Na > Li. This will be recognized as the order of ionic mobilities in water. Nevertheless the movement is mostly in molecular form in the nonaqueous layer (which is used in the model to represent the protoplasmic surface) since the salts are very weak electrolytes in this layer. The chief reason for this order of penetration lies in the fact that the partition coefficients exhibit the same order, that of cesium being greatest and that of lithium smallest. The partition coefficients largely control the rate of entrance since they determine the concentration gradient in the non-aqueous layer which in turn controls the process of penetration. The relative molecular mobilities (diffusion constants) in the non-aqueous layer do not differ greatly. The ionic mobilities are not known (except for K
