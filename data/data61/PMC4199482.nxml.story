How does the pregnant uterus coordinate a kilogram of smooth muscle tissue into repetitive, synchronous, organ-level contractions of human labor? Action potential propagation recruits tissue for contraction over short distances, but a single action potential sweeping through the uterus cannot explain organ-level function. Multiple action potentials seem to arise simultaneously, and apparently spontaneously, in different “regions” of the uterine wall. We interpret the existence of regions as a consequence of there being a maximum distance a single action potential can travel. To explain the synchronization of regional contractions, we use a second mechanism: initiation of contractions by stretch. Because the uterus is pressurized, contraction of the first region raises the intrauterine pressure slightly, which stretches the entire uterine wall. The stretch recruits another regional contraction, which generates more pressure. This positive feed-back recruits most regions into simultaneous activity. With this mechanism we simulate the contraction patterns of human labor, and show how contractions emerge from complex interactions. We explain why the decades-long search for the uterine pacemaker has failed, and why drugs that stimulate or inhibit tissue contractions have enigmatic effects at the organ-level. This simulation, for the first time, successfully links tissue experiments to clinical obstetrics.
