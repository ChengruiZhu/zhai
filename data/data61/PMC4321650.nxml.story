Renal cell carcinoma (RCC) is the most common type of cancer arising from the kidney, with a male to female ratio of 2:1. The incidence of RCC is rising. In males, it was the seventh most common cancer in the People’s Republic of China in 2012. RCC is resistant to radiotherapy and chemotherapy, but approximately 20% of patients with advanced RCC respond to immunotherapy. Novel therapies targeting angiogenesis and signaling pathways have been proven to be effective for advanced or metastatic RCC in Western countries. Due to the heterogeneity of RCC between races, it is necessary to have an overview of targeted therapies, especially everolimus, for patients with advanced RCC in the People’s Republic of China. Three targeted therapeutic agents have been approved in Mainland China for the treatment of patients with advanced RCC, ie, two tyrosine kinase inhibitors (sorafenib and sunitinib) and one mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitor (everolimus). Compared with Western patients with advanced or metastatic RCC, Chinese patients with the same disease respond better to sorafenib and sunitinib as first-line targeted therapy, but sunitinib has a relatively higher risk of toxicity. Everolimus, an mTOR inhibitor that can be administered orally, is well tolerated and acceptable to Chinese patients. Everolimus has competitive advantages as second-line targeted treatment for Chinese patients with advanced RCC who are resistant to first-line tyrosine kinase inhibitors. Despite a lack of noninferiority when compared with sunitinib as first-line therapy, the sunitinib-everolimus paradigm is still recommended as standard therapy for patients with advanced RCC. Although most studies of targeted therapies for advanced RCC have obvious limitations, such as small sample size and retrospective design, up-to-date evidence indicates that everolimus would be an ideal agent as second-line targeted treatment for advanced or metastatic RCC in the People’s Republic of China.
