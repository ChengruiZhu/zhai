Electrode impedance (EI) is the first objective assessment carried out during the surgical procedure and follow-up of cochlear implanted patients. This measure provides information on the integrity of electrodes and on the surrounding environment. It is one of the main factors responsible for energy consumption of the cochlear implant (CI). The aim of our study is to investigate changes over time in EI in adult recipients implanted with the perimodiolar array by comparing differences in various cochlear segments. In addition, we explore the relationship between these objective measures and subjective measures such as T-level and C-level. We studied 28 adult patients. Impedance values (IVs) were calculated in "common-ground" (CG) and in monopolar (M1+2) mode for electrode groups in basal middle and apical segments. We found significant decreases in IVs between activation and 1 month. We obtained higher values for basal impedance, whereas lower IVs were found for apical electrodes at all observation times. Statistical pairing over time between impedance and T/C values showed significant correlation for both global impedance (GI) and T-C levels at CG and M1+2 mode up to 6 months. Segregated statistical analysis also showed a significant and prolonged correlation of basal IVs and fitting parameters. The higher basal impedance over time can be explained by the higher proportion of newly formed tissue in this region. The linear correlation of impedances with the fitting parameters become not significant after 3/6 months for the apical and middle segments and remained significant only for the basal region over time. This behaviour underlines the importance of persistence in intra-cochlear factors in influencing fitting parameters in the basal segment.
