The hypotheses tested were: survival rate of fully and partially retained glass-carbomer sealants is higher than those of high-viscosity glass-ionomer, with and without energy supplied, and that of resin composite; survival rate of fully and partially retained sealants of high-viscosity glass-ionomer with energy supplied is higher than those without energy supplied. The randomized clinical trial covered 407 children, with a mean age of 8 years. The evaluation took place after 0.5, 1 and 2 years. Survival of sealant material in occlusal and in smooth surfaces, using the traditional categorization (fully and partially retained versus completely lost sealants) and the modified categorization (fully and more than 2/3 of the sealant retained versus completely lost sealants), were dependent variables. The Kaplan–Meier survival method was used. According to both categorizations of partially retained sealants, the survival of completely and partially retained resin composite sealants in occlusal and in smooth tooth surfaces was statistically significantly higher, and those of glass-carbomer sealants lower, than those of sealants of the other three groups. There was no statistically significant difference in the survival rates of completely and partially retained high-viscosity glass-ionomer sealants with and without energy supplied in occlusal and in smooth surfaces. After 2 years, glass-carbomer sealant retention was the poorest, adding energy to high-viscosity glass-ionomer sealant did not increase the retention rate and resin composite sealants were retained the longest. We suggest the use of the modified categorization of partially retained sealants in future studies. It seems not necessary to cure high-viscosity glass-ionomer sealants. The use of glass-carbomer sealants cannot be recommended yet.
