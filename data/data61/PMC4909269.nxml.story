During infection of their arthropod vectors, arthropod-borne viruses (arboviruses) such as dengue viruses traverse several anatomical barriers that are believed to cause dramatic reductions in population size. Such population bottlenecks challenge the maintenance of viral genetic diversity, which is considered critical for fitness and adaptability of arboviruses. Anatomical barriers in the vector were previously associated with both maintenance of arboviral genetic diversity and alteration of the variant repertoire. However, the relative role of random processes and natural selection, and the influence of vector genetic heterogeneity have not been elucidated. In this study, we used high-throughput sequencing to monitor dengue virus genetic diversity during infection of several genetic backgrounds of their mosquito vector. Our results show that initial infection of the vector is randomly founded by only a few tens of individual virus genomes. The overall level of viral genetic diversity generated during infection was predominantly under purifying selection but differed significantly between mosquito genetic backgrounds. Thus, in addition to random evolutionary forces and the purging of deleterious mutations that shape dengue virus genetic diversity during vector infection, our results also point to a novel role for vector genetic factors in the genetic breadth of virus populations.
