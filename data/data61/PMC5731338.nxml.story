Resistance to chemotherapy is a primary problem for the effective treatment of ovarian cancer. Recently, increasing evidence has demonstrated that miRNAs modulate many important molecular pathways involved in chemotherapy. Previous studies demonstrated that miR-199a affected ovarian cancer cell resistance to cisplatin (DDP). However, the role of miR-199a and its target genes in determination of ovarian cancer sensitivity to DDP remains unclear. Quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction was used to detect the expression levels of miR-199a in ovarian cancer tissues and C13* and OV2008 cell lines. After transfection of miR-199a mimic or inhibitor, flow cytometry was used to detect cell apoptosis exposed to DDP. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and Western blot assay were applied to detect tumor necrosis factor-α levels and protein expression levels of Bax, Fas, Fas-associated death domain, and caspase-8. The results indicated that the expression of miR-199a was downregulated and hypoxia-inducible factor 1α (Hif1α) upregulated in the ovarian tumors compared with those in the corresponding normal tissues. Besides, the expression levels of miR-199a were significantly higher in OV2008 cells compared with those in C13* cells. Moreover, suppression of Hif1α reversed the inhibiting function of miR-199a inhibitor on DDP-induced apoptosis in the OV2008 cells. However, overexpression of both miR-199a and Hif1α reduced DDP-induced apoptosis in C13* cells. In conclusion, miR-199a may change DDP resistance in ovarian cancer by regulating Hif1α.
