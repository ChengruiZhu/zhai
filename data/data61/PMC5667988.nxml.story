The Long arm of chromosome 20 (20q) is closely related to the development of colorectal cancer, so identifying the expression profile of genes on 20q through a comprehensive overview is indispensable. In this article, preliminar experimental data, several available databases and bioinformatics tools such as the Cancer Genome Atlas, the Encyclopedia of DNA Elements, the JASPAR database and starBase were combined to analyze the correlation between genes and chromosomal aberrations, microRNA and transcription factors, as well as to explore the expression feature and potential regulative mechanism. The results showed that the most frequently unregulated genes in colorectal cancer arelocated on chromosome 20q, present a significant CNA–mRNA correlation.Furthermore, the genes with mRNA overexpression showed co-expression features and tended to be clustered within the same genomic neighborhoods. Then, several genes were selected to carry out further analysis and demonstrated that shared transcription factors, a conserved bidirectional promoter, and competition for a limited pool of microRNAin the 3’UTR of mRNA may be the underlying mechanisms behind the co-expression of physically adjacent genes.Finally, the databases, Lentivirus shRNA, and qPCR were used to find that these adjacent genes with co-expression cooperatively participated in the same biological pathways associated with the pathogenesis and development of colorectal cancer.
