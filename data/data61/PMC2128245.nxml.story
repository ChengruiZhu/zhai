 Spontaneous pneumonia occurred to a considerable extent among stock monkeys at the Army Medical School. This pneumonia occurred chiefly in the form of an epidemic outbreak shortly after the arrival of a large shipment of monkeys, and was shown to be due in large part to transmission of infection from monkey to monkey, either directly or indirectly. That spread of the epidemic was facilitated by overcrowding was indicated by the fact that in a subsequent shipment of monkeys, which were kept in pairs in separate cages and were not allowed to come into contact with the monkeys among which the epidemic occurred, no cases of spontaneous pneumonia developed. The close analogy between the epidemic of lobar pneumonia that occurred among the monkeys and similar epidemics of lobar pneumonia that occurred during the war among certain groups of newly drafted troops shortly after their arrival at camp is very striking, and would seem to indicate that pneumococcus pneumonia may become an epidemic disease among groups of susceptible individuals when they are assembled under conditions that facilitate the ready transfer of infection from individual to individual. Bacteriological examination showed the spontaneous pneumonia to be due in the great majority of cases to infection with Pneumococcus Type IV. Immunological classification of the strains of pneurnococci by cross-agglutination tests showed that the majority fell into two biological groups. Two cases were apparently caused by
