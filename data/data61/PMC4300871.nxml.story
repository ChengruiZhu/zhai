A total of 60 patients were included and had complete 12-month follow-up. The prevalence of annular tears among all patients was 42% (n = 25). Outcome data in patients without annular tears were as follows: ODI, 66% preoperatively and 26% postoperatively; VAS score for back pain, 8.0 preoperatively and 2.6 postoperatively; and VAS score for leg pain, 2.9 preoperatively and 1.2 postoperatively. Among those patients with tears, the prevalence of central tears was 80%, the prevalence of paracentral tears was 12%, and the prevalence of lateral tears was 8%. Outcome data in patients with central tears were as follows: ODI, 66% preoperatively and 26% postoperatively; VAS score for back pain, 7.8 preoperatively and 2.6 postoperatively; and VAS score for leg pain, 5.2 preoperatively and 0.5 postoperatively. Outcome data in patients with paracentral tears were as follows: ODI, 86% preoperatively and 59% postoperatively; VAS score for back pain, 8.8 preoperatively and 3.3 postoperatively; and VAS score for leg pain, 5.0 preoperatively and 5.4 postoperatively. Outcome data in patients with lateral tears were as follows: ODI, 6.5 preoperatively and 2.6 postoperatively; VAS score for back pain, 9.2 preoperatively and 0.2 postoperatively; and VAS score for leg pain, 1.4 preoperatively and 0.7 postoperatively. In those patients with paracentral tears, there was a significantly higher incidence of postoperative radicular symptoms both from an intensity standpoint and from a duration standpoint. Other complications did not vary among those patients with or without annular tears.
