Primary retinal cell cultures and immunocytochemistry are important experimental platforms in ophthalmic research. Translation of retinal cells from their native environment to the in vitro milieu leads to cellular stress, jeopardizing their in vivo phenotype features. Moreover, the specificity and stability of many retinal immunochemical markers are poorly evaluated in retinal cell cultures. Hence, we here evaluated the expression profile of 17 retinal markers, that is, recoverin, rhodopsin, arrestin, Chx10, PKC, DCX, CRALBP, GS, vimentin, TPRV4, RBPMS, Brn3a, Î²-tubulin III, NeuN, MAP2, GFAP, and synaptophysin. At 7 and 18 days of culture, the marker expression profiles of mouse postnatal retinal cells were compared with their age-matched in vivo retinas. We demonstrate stable in vitro expression of all markers, except for arrestin and CRALBP. Differences in cellular expression and location of some markers were observed, both over time in culture and compared with the age-matched retina. We hypothesize that these differences are likely culture condition dependent. Taken together, we suggest a thorough evaluation of the antibodies in specific culture settings, before extrapolating the in vitro results to an in vivo setting. Moreover, the identification of specific cell types may require a combination of different genes expressed or markers with structural information.
