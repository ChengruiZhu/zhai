In the present study, induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs), induced neural stem cells (iNSCs), mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) and an immortalized cell line (RMNE6), representing different characteristics of stem cells, were transplanted into normal and/or injured brain areas of rodent stroke models, and their effects were compared to select suitable stem cells for cell replacement stroke therapy. The rat and mice ischaemic models were constructed using the middle cerebral artery occlusion technique. Both electrocoagulation of the artery and the intraluminal filament technique were used. The behaviour changes and fates of grafted stem cells were determined mainly by behaviour testing and immunocytochemistry. Following iPSC transplantation into the corpora striata of normal mice, a tumour developed in the brain. The iNSCs survived well and migrated towards the injured area without differentiation. Although there was no tumourigenesis in the brain of normal or ischaemic mice after the iNSCs were transplanted in the cortices, the behaviour in ischaemic mice was not improved. Upon transplanting MSC and RMNE6 cells into ischaemic rat brains, results similar to iNSCs in mice were seen. However, transplantation of RMNE6 caused a brain tumour. Thus, tumourigenesis and indeterminate improvement of behaviour are challenging problems encountered in stem cell therapy for stroke, and the intrinsic characteristics of stem cells should be remodelled before transplantation.
