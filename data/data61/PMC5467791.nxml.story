Malignant pleural mesothelioma (MPM) is an aggressive cancer for which more effective treatments are needed. In this study, strong to moderate staining of MET and ERK5 was detected in 67.1 and 48% of the analyzed 73 human mesothelioma tumors, and significant correlation of MET and ERK5 expression was identified (P<0.05). We evaluated the doublecortin-like kinase 1 (DCLK1) expression in human mesothelioma tumors. Our results showed that 50.7% of the immunohistochemistry analyzed human mesothelioma tumors have strong to moderate staining of DCLK1, and its expression is significantly correlated with MET or ERK5 expression (P<0.05). Also, the upregulation of DCLK1 is correlated with poor prognosis in MPM patients (P=0.0235). To investigate whether DCLK1 is downstream of MET/ERK5 signaling in human mesothelioma, the effect of DCLK1 expression was analyzed after treatments with either the MET inhibitor XL184 or the ERK5 inhibitor XMD8-92 in human mesothelioma cell lines. Our results showed that the MET inhibitor XL184 reduced the expression of phospho-ERK5 and DCLK1 expression in human mesothelioma cell lines. In addition, the ERK5 inhibitor XMD8-92 reduced the expression of phospho-ERK5 and DCLK1 expression in human mesothelioma cell lines. Furthermore, XML184 and XMD8-92 treatment impaired invasion and tumor sphere formation ability of H290 mesothelioma cells. These results suggest that DCLK1 is regulated by MET/ERK5 signaling in human mesothelioma, and the MET/ERK5/DCLK1 signaling cascade could be further developed into a promising therapeutic target against mesothelioma.
