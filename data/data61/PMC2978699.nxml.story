Faced with environmental cycles and daily alternation between light and darkness, organisms have evolved a time measuring mechanism, the biological clocks. Besides following circadian rhythms, all physiological variables must be coordinated with one another, like an orchestra led by a conductor; if the appropriate rhythm is not kept, noise rather than music is produced. In an organism, when this temporal order is disrupted due to aging or shift work, health is compromised. Afflictions include metabolic syndrome, diabetes and cardiovascular diseases, among others, or even worse prognosis of preexisting illnesses like cancer. Since the circadian pacemaker (suprachiasmatic nuclei) is located deep within the brain in humans, the only way to evaluate its function is by assessing the output signals, observing marker rhythms such as the sleep-wake cycle, body temperature or activity. The problem is that isolated variable measurement is not error free. However, we can increase reliability by combining the information from several circadian marker rhythms in an integrated variable that we have called TAP (Temperature, Activity and Position), a methodological approach that has not been used before, that in conjunction with a new index called Circadian Function Index, provides a useful tool for standardizing the status of the circadian system.
