Peritoneal gamma/delta T cells from Listeria-immune mice show an enhanced potential to expand when restimulated with antigens or mitogens in vitro (see companion paper [Skeen, M. J., and H. K. Ziegler. 1993. J. Exp. Med. 178:971]). When cocultured with peritoneal alpha/beta T cells, the gamma/delta T cell population expanded preferentially even when the in vitro stimulus was specific for the alpha/beta T cell population. Purified gamma/delta T cells did not respond to alpha/beta T cell-specific stimuli. If isolated T cell subsets were recombined in cell mixing experiments, the resulting proliferative response was greater than additive. Irradiated alpha/beta T cells could enhance the proliferation of responding gamma/delta T cells, but the effect was unidirectional; i.e., irradiated gamma/delta T cells did not stimulate responding gamma/delta T cells. This effect appeared to be cytokine mediated and did not require cell-cell contact. Both recombinant interleukin 2 (rIL-2) and rIL-7 could support the expansion of the gamma/delta T cells, while rIL-7 was only minimally stimulatory for the alpha/beta T cells. The magnitude of the response by gamma/delta T cells to rIL-7 exceeded the response to other in vitro stimuli, including immobilized anti-T cell receptor monoclonal antibody, and was 50-100-fold greater than the alpha/beta T cell response to IL-7. This unique sensitivity of gamma/delta T cells to IL- 7 was strongly enhanced by the presence of accessory cells. These cells could be replaced by rIL-1, establishing a synergy for IL-1 and IL-7 as factors that could uniquely stimulate this gamma/delta T cell population. Isolated peritoneal gamma/delta T cells from Listeria- immune mice react to heat-killed Listeria preparations in the presence of macrophages accessory cells in a non-H-2-restricted manner. Considered collectively, these results suggest a potential mechanism by which gamma/delta T cells can predominate in epithelial tissues and at sites of infection.
