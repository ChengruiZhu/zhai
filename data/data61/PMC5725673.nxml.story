Fragmentation influences the population dynamics and community composition of vertebrate animals. Fragmentation effects on rodent species in forests may, in turn, affect seed predation and dispersal of many plant species. Previous studies have usually addressed this question by monitoring a single species, and their results are contradictory. Very few studies have discussed the fragmentation effect on rodent–seed interaction among tree species with different seed sizes, which can significantly influence rodent foraging preference and seed fate. Given that fruiting periods for many coexisting plant species overlap, the changing foraging preference of rodents may substantially alter plant communities. In this study, we monitored the dispersal and predation by rodents of 9600 seeds, belonging to 4 Fagaceae species with great variation in seed size, in both the edge and interior areas of 12 tropical forest fragments ranging in area from 6.3 to 13872.9 ha in Southwest China. The results showed that forest fragmentation altered the seed fates of all the species, but the intensity and even the direction of fragmentation effect differed between species with large versus small seeds. For the seeds harvested, fragment size showed negative effects in forest interiors but positive effects at edges for the 2 large‐seeded species, but showed little effect for the 2 small‐seeded species. For the seeds removed, negative effects of fragment size only existed among the small‐seeded species. The different fragmentation effect on seed dispersal and predation among plant species may, in turn, translate into the composition differences of the regeneration of the whole fragmented forest.
