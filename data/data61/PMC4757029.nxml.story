Cediranib is an orally available, pan-VEGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor. A previous Phase III study of patients with recurrent glioblastoma treated with this drug did not meet the primary end of progressive-free survival (PFS). We identified one patient, a 57-year-old Caucasian female who, following surgery in October 2008 and concurrent temozolomide and radiation therapy from November 8, 2008, to January 6, 2009, developed a tumor progression of the left posterior frontal measuring 1.2 x 1.5 cm in February 2009. She was enrolled in a randomized, Phase III, placebo-controlled, partially-blinded clinical trial of cediranib as either monotherapy or in combination with lomustine (CCNU) versus CCNU. She was randomized to receive a combination therapy with 1st cycle CCNU 190 mg and cediranib 20 mg per day on April 15, 2009. However, she developed nephrotic syndrome and uncontrolled hypertension and was taken off this study in May 2010. Her six-week MRI showed a 50% tumor regression and a complete response at twenty-four weeks. With no enhancement seen on MRI on June 4, 2015, she has been off therapy and in clinical remission over five years with high functional level and good quality of life (KPS-90%). This is a case report of successful therapy for recurrent glioblastoma with long-term remission despite termination of therapy greater than six years from cediranib and limited CCNU dosage.
