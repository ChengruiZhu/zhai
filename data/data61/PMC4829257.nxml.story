During oogenesis, oocytes accumulate transcripts and proteins that support meiotic maturation and early embryogenesis. Although a number of such maternal-effect factors have been identified, our knowledge about the molecular machinery that drives meiotic progression and maternal-to-zygotic transition is still limited. In particular, the functional significance of epigenetic changes, which accompany meiotic maturation and early embryogenesis, and the key epigenetic regulators involved are largely unknown. Here, we identify Setdb1, a lysine methyltransferase specific for the repressive histone H3 lysine 9 (H3K9) methylation, as a maternal-effect factor that is essential for meiotic progression in oocytes and mitotic cell divisions in early embryos in mouse. We show that Setdb1 is highly expressed in growing oocytes and directly represses the expression Cdc14b, a phosphatase that inhibits meiotic progression. Setdb1 is also required to repress retrotransposons and maintain genomic stability in oocytes. Embryos derived from Setdb1-depleted oocytes show severe defects in cell cycle progression, progressive delays in preimplantation development, and degeneration before reaching the blastocyst stage. The roles of Setdb1 in meiotic progression and preimplantation development require its catalytic activity. Our findings demonstrate that Setdb1 is an important regulator of Cdc14b, thus uncovering a molecular link between the epigenetic machinery and the major signaling pathway that drives meiotic progression.
