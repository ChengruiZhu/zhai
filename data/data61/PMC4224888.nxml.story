Patients were 83% male and 87% Caucasian, with mean age 42 years; 10% were HCV antibody positive. In the DRV/r monotherapy arm, there were more patients with nadir CD4 count below 200 cells/µL (30% versus 22%). In the primary efficacy analysis, HIV-1 RNA <50 copies/mL by Week 48 (intent-to-treat (ITT)) was 118/137 (86.1%) in the DRV/r monotherapy arm versus 129/136 (94.9%) in the triple therapy arm; DRV/r monotherapy did not show non-inferiority versus triple therapy in the primary analysis (difference=− 8.7%, 95% CI −15.5 to −1.8%). In the multivariate analysis, the main predictor of treatment failure was nadir CD4 count. For patients with nadir CD4 counts <200 cells/µL, HIV-1 RNA suppression rates at Week 48 were 27/41 (66%) in the DRV/r monotherapy arm and 29/30 (97%) in the triple therapy arm; for patients with CD4 nadir at least 200 cells/µL, HIV-1 RNA suppression rates were 91/96 (95%) in the DRV/r monotherapy arm and 100/106 (94%) in the triple therapy arm. In the overall population, by a switch included analysis, efficacy was 92.0% versus 96.3%, showing non-inferiority (difference=− 4.3%, 95% CI=−9.7 to +1.2%). No treatment-emergent primary PI mutations were detected in three patients with sustained elevations in HIV-1 RNA at least 400 copies/mL (two on PI monotherapy, one on triple therapy). CD4 counts remained stable during the trial in both arms.
