Malaria results in hundreds of thousands of deaths annually. The two most effective malaria control interventions have been insecticide treated bed nets and indoor residual spraying of insecticides but their successes are now threatened by insecticide resistance in mosquitoes. Insecticide deployment strategies can be designed to try to minimise the spread of insecticide resistance. We develop a highly flexible model of the evolution of insecticide resistance which we use to assess the relative performance of two insecticide deployment strategies: two insecticides used in sequence (where one is replaced by the other once a resistance threshold is reached) or as a mixture (where they are applied together). The relative performance of the strategies depended on the input parameter values that are likely to depend on the insecticide properties and local malaria transmission patterns. In the parameter space we explored, mixtures were favoured when insecticide effectiveness (ability to kill wildtype susceptible mosquitoes) was high and exposure (the proportion of mosquitoes that encounter the insecticide) was low. If insecticides do not reliably kill susceptible mosquitoes, it is likely that sequential deployment will be better. This flexible model is designed to enable detailed exploration of deployment issues and their influence on the strategies most likely to minimise the evolution of insecticide resistance.
