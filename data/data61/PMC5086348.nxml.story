The cystic artery is the key structure sought to be clipped or ligated during laparoscopic or conventional cholecystectomy. The possible complications like hemorrhage or hepatobiliary injury are always centered on the search, dissection, and clipping or ligation of the cystic artery, many a time because of possibility of variations in its course and relations to the biliary ducts. This descriptive study was carried out to document the normal anatomy and different variations of the cystic artery to contribute to improve surgical safety. This study conducted on 82 cadavers revealed cystic artery with mean length of 16.9 mm (ranged between 2 mm and 55 mm) and mean diameter of 1.6 mm (range between 1 mm and 5 mm). The origin of cystic artery from celiac right hepatic artery was found in 79.3% and in the remaining 20.7% it was replaced. Single cystic artery was present in 72% and double cystic artery in 28%. Considering the site of origin of the cystic artery with reference to Calot's triangle, it was observed within the triangle in 62.2% and outside it in 37.8%. All the cystic arteries passed through Calot's triangle except for 3.6%. The cystic artery crossed the common hepatic duct anteriorly in 26.8% and posteriorly in 6.1%. It crossed common bile duct anteriorly in 1.2% and posteriorly in 3.7%. The knowledge of such variations and its awareness will decrease morbidity and help to keep away from a number of surgical complications during cholecystectomy.
