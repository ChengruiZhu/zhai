The generation of an in vitro major histocompatibility complex class I specific response of CD4-CD8- T cell receptor (TCR) alpha beta cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL) and their allogeneic tumor rejection were investigated. Inocula of BALBRL male 1 were rejected in C57BL/6 (B6) mice treated with minimum essential medium (MEM) (control), anti-L3T4 (CD4) monoclonal antibody (mAb) or anti-Lyt-2.2 (CD8) mAb and CTL against the tumor were generated in vitro. No rejection and no induction of CTL were observed in B6 mice treated with anti-L3T4 (CD4) plus anti-Lyt-2.2 (CD8) mAb. CTL with the classical Thy-1+ CD3+CD4-CD8+ TCR alpha beta phenotype were generated in mixed lymphocyte tumor cell culture (MLTC) spleen cells from B6 mice treated with MEM (control) or anti-L3T4 (CD4) mAb, whereas CTL with an unusual Thy-1+CD3+CD4-CD8- TCR alpha beta phenotype were generated in MLTC spleen cells from anti-Lyt- 2.2 (CD8) mAb-treated B6 mice. Both types of CTL were reactive with both H-2Kd and Dd (Ld) class I antigen. These findings suggest that when CD4+ cells were blocked by anti-L3T4 (CD4) mAb, CD8+ CTL mediated rejection, and when CD8+ cells were blocked by anti-Lyt-2.2 (CD8) mAb, CD4+ cells were capable of mediating rejection, although less efficiently than CD8+ cells, by inducing CD4-CD8- TCR alpha beta CTL. The finding that adoptive transfer of CD4 and CD8-depleted MLTC spleen cells, obtained from anti-Lyt-2.2 (CD8) mAb-treated B6 mice that had rejected BALBRL male 1, resulted in rejection of BALBRL male 1 inoculated into B6 nu/nu mice confirmed the above notion. CTL clones with the CD4-CD8- TCR alpha beta phenotype specific for Ld were established.
