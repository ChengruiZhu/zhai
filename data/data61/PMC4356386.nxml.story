The aim of the present study was to apply the Charlson comorbidity index (CCI) to evaluate the impact of comorbidity on lung cancer mortality in individuals not exhibiting lung cancer at the commencement of follow-up. Data from 9,579 participants without lung cancer were extracted from the Liverpool Lung Project between 1999 and 2010 and linked to the Hospital Episode Statistics database. The occurrence of comorbidities was assessed one year prior to the individual inclusion date. CCI scores were computed and Cox regression analysis was used to evaluate the association between comorbidity and lung cancer mortality using a competitive risk approach. During a median follow-up of 11 years, 1,320/9,579 (13.7%) individuals developed lung cancer, of which 886 (67.1%) succumbed to lung cancer and 875 of the 9,579 individuals (9.1%) succumbed due to other causes. The severity of comorbidity was associated with higher lung cancer-specific mortality; low to moderate comorbidity exhibited a hazard ratio (HR) of 2.86 [95% confidence interval (CI), 1.17–7.02] and severe comorbidity exhibited an HR of 5.16 (95% CI, 2.07–12.89). Furthermore, the CCI score determined that the severity of comorbidity increased the risk of lung cancer-specific mortality. Thus, CCI score is a good predictor of lung cancer-specific mortality and the use of comorbidity burdens in the clinical management of lung cancer is recommended.
