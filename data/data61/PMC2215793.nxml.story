Calcium uptake produced by a potassium contracture in isolated frog twitch fibers was 6.7 +/- 0.8 pmol in 0.7 cm of fiber (mean +/- SEM, 21 observations) in the presence of 30 microM D600. When potassium was applied to fibers paralyzed by the combination of 30 microM D600, cold, and a prior contracture, the calcium uptake fell to 3.0 +/- 0.7 pmol (11): the fibers were soaked in 45Ca in sodium Ringer for 3 min before 45Ca, in a potassium solution, was added for 2 min; each estimate of uptake was corrected for 5 min of resting influx, measured from the same fiber (average = 2.3 +/- 0.3 pmol). The calcium influx into paralyzed fibers is unrelated to contraction. This voltage-sensitive, slowly inactivating influx, which can be blocked by 4 mM nickel, has properties similar to the calcium current described by several laboratories. The paired difference in calcium uptake between contracting and paralyzed fibers, 2.9 +/- 0.8 pmol (16), is a component of influx related to contraction. Its size varies with contracture size and it occurs after tension production: 45Ca applied immediately after contracture is taken up in essentially the same amounts as 45Ca added before contraction. This delayed uptake is probably a "reflux" refilling a binding site on the cytoplasmic side of the T membrane, which had been emptied during the prior contracture, perhaps to initiate it. We detect no component of calcium uptake related to excitation-contraction coupling occurring before or during a contracture.
