The activity of neurons in the brain is mediated through changes in the probability of random transitions between open and closed states of ion channels. Since differences in morphology define distinct types of neuron and may underlie neurological disorders, it is important to understand how morphology influences the functional consequences of these random transitions. However, the complexities of neuronal morphology, together with the large number of ion channels expressed by a single neuron, have made this issue difficult to explore systematically. We introduce and validate new computational tools that enable efficient generation and simulation of models containing ion channels distributed across complex neuronal morphologies. Using these tools we demonstrate that the impact of random ion channel opening depends on neuronal morphology and ion channel kinetics. We show that in a realistic model of a neuron important for navigation and memory random gating of ion channels substantially modifies responses to synaptic input. Our results suggest a new and general perspective, whereby output from a neuron is a probabilistic rather than a fixed function of synaptic input to its dendrites. These results and new tools will contribute to the understanding of how intrinsic properties of neurons influence computations carried out within the brain.
