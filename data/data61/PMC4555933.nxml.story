Oral rehabilitation of missing teeth in cleft patients has acceptable success rates. A two-stage approach is indicated; however, timing of implant placement in the grafted maxilla varies within existing protocols. This case highlights successful implant osseointegration and esthetic oral rehabilitation following placement of two implants at 5 months after maxillary grafting (alveolar bone grafting) with a corticocancellous block obtained from the iliac crest. A 31-year-old male patient had already undergone repair of his bilateral cleft lip and soft palate according to established guidelines for cleft patients. Initial closure of his alveolar clefts and further correction of the maxillary hypoplasia with a bi-maxillary osteotomy were completed in 2002. However, bone resorption due to infection in 2003 necessitated removal of all maxillary incisors. The patient was not satisfied with the removable partial denture provided. In 2007, he did undergo anterior maxillary augmentation under general anesthesia, and 5 months later two implants were placed. A 3-unit bridge did replace functional and esthetic demands. Postoperative recovery was uneventful, and overall bone loss, and oral health remain within standards 28 months following implant placement. Optimal outcome is achievable when replacing missing teeth in cleft patients when timing does not exceed approximately a 6-month interval from bone grafting to implant placement. This article demonstrates that overall esthetic and functional rehabilitation is feasible in cleft lip and palate patients. In this patient, overall oral treatment was achieved with an implant prosthesis.
