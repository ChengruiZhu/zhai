Due to the current obesity epidemic in the United States, there is growing interest in efficient, effective ways to increase energy expenditure and weight loss. Research has shown that high-intensity exercise elicits a higher Excess Post-Exercise Oxygen Consumption (EPOC) throughout the day compared to steady-state exercise. Currently, there is no single research study that examines the differences in Recovery Oxygen Consumption (ROC) resulting from high-intensity interval training (HIIT) modalities. The purpose of this study is to review the impact of circuit training (CT) and speed interval training (SIT), on ROC in both regular exercising and sedentary populations. A total of 26 participants were recruited from the UW-Eau Claire campus and divided into regularly exercising and sedentary groups, according to self-reported exercise participation status. Oxygen consumption was measured during and after two HIIT sessions and was used to estimate caloric expenditure. There was no significant difference in caloric expenditure during and after exercise among individuals who regularly exercise and individuals who are sedentary. There was also no significant difference in ROC between regular exercisers and sedentary or between SIT and CT. However, there was a significantly higher caloric expenditure in SIT vs. CT regardless of exercise status. It is recommended that individuals engage in SIT vs. CT when the goal is to maximize overall caloric expenditure. With respect to ROC, individuals can choose either modalities of HIIT to achieve similar effects on increased oxygen consumption post-exercise.
