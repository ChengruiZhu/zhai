Cholesterol crystal embolism (CCE) is a rare and severe multisystemic disorder. It results from a massive release of cholesterol crystals from widespread atherosclerotic disease. The main difference with atherosclerosis is the severity and the quantity of the embolic events that occur during the course of the disease, eventually leading to multivisceral failure and death. The symptoms are multiple and make it a diagnostic challenge. Fundoscopic examination can be of great help, showing retinal emboli in up to 25% of the cases, and has been rarely described in the ophthalmologic literature. We report the case of a 77-year-old man with acute renal failure after coronarography. Retinal emboli seen in the fundus confirmed the diagnosis of cholesterol crystal embolism and thus prevented any further invasive investigations. In this case, anticoagulants must be stopped and any further endovascular procedure proscribed. Although impossible for this patient, peritoneal dialysis should be preferred to hemodialysis because it does not need any anticoagulation. Systemic corticosteroid can be used in the acute phase. 
Fundoscopic examination should be performed each time cholesterol crystal embolism is suspected. When typical emboli are seen in the retina, it permits avoiding invasive investigations and saving precious time for the management of this potentially lethal disease.
