During early development of many organisms, patterning along the dorsal-ventral axis is regulated by the activities of two signaling centers located on the ventral and dorsal sides of the embryo. One of these centers produces growth factors of the BMP family that act as morphogens, whereas the other center secretes BMP antagonists such as Chordin that regulate the flow of BMPs along the dorsal-ventral axis. Expression from these two signaling centers results in roughly complementary distributions of BMP and BMP antagonist. We have analyzed BMP-mediated dorsal-ventral axis patterning in embryos of sea urchins, which are phylogenetically close to vertebrates and extensively rely on cell-cell interactions for their development. We found that in sea urchins, unlike in most organisms, the activity of a single signaling center located on the ventral side is responsible for generating both the ventral and the dorsal sides of the embryo. In addition, we discovered that the BMP2/4 gene is co-expressed with Chordin in this ventral center but that the BMP2/4 protein is translocated to the opposite side of the embryo where it activates the genetic program responsible for dorsal differentiation. Our study reveals an unusual example of signaling at a distance by a BMP growth factor. It also highlights that although the proteins used for dorsal-ventral patterning are evolutionarily conserved, there are considerable variations in the manner in which these proteins can be used in different species to generate a gradient of BMP morphogen.
