 in tissues of patients with gastric cancer. Fresh tumor tissues were collected from 26 newly diagnosed patients with histologically confirmed gastric cancer (mean age, 51 years; range, 21–81 years; 7 females, 19 males). All patients were treated surgically with curative intent. One portion of the fresh tissues was prepared for flow cytometric analysis and another was immediately snap frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80°C for later use in quantitative polymerase chain reaction. The analysis was based on two groups of tissues, namely the cancer group and cancer-adjacent group. The presence of CD34/CD133 double-positive cells was determined in cancer-adjacent and cancer tissues by flow cytometry. The analysis revealed that the total number of EPCs in cancer tissue was slightly greater than the number in the cancer-adjacent tissue, but not to the point of statistical significance. The number of EPCs in cancer-adjacent and cancer tissues of patients with early-stage gastric cancer was higher than the EPC count in late-stage gastric cancer patients, and significant differences were identified in the number of EPCs in cancer tissue between patients of different tumor stages. Levels of cluster of differentiation (CD)34, CD133 and vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2 were not significantly different in cancer-adjacent tissue compared with cancer tissue. These results suggest that cancer-adjacent and cancer tissue of gastric cancer patients may be used as a reference index in the clinical and pathological staging of tumors.
