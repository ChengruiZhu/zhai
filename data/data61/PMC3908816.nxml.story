Objetives: The aim of this study was to determine which of three methods for measuring BIC (bone-to-implant contact), using vestibular and lingual scanning electron microscopy (SEM) for different implant systems at 15, 30 and 90 days post-surgery was the most precise. An elemental analysis with SEM was used to evaluate neoformed bone composition for three implant systems at the same study times. 
Material and Methods: 36 implants were placed in eighteen Beagle dogs mandible about one year old and weighing approximately 12-13 kg in order to evaluate bone apposition to three different implant surfaces. It was used the third and fourth premolar and ﬁrst molar distal sockets in both quadrants of the mandible (3P3, 4P4 and 1M1). Teeth were hemi-sected and the distal roots were removed. The specimens were prepared for histological examination and each section surface was stained using Masson’s trichrome and hematoxylin and eosin stains. BIC evaluations were performed by the three methods, BIC I (the quantity of mineralized bone in direct contact with the implant’s titanium surface across the entire threaded area); BIC II (along a line that passes from apex to apex of the implant threads); BIC III (both in areas around and above the threads and in between threads). 
Results: Both BIC and bone content were analyzed for all implants placed in P3, P4 y M1 alveoli on both, the buccal and palatine sides (elemental analysis quantified Ca, P, O and C). It was seen it was only at the ninety-day mark that high percentages of calcium were present. 
Conclusions: This study suggest that BIC III evaluation is the most certain method for establishing the quantity of bone formed as the BIC area.
