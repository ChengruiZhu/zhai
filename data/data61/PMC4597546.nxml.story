During the follow-up period, 94 incident lower-extremity stress fractures were documented in the study cohort and the cumulative incidence of stress fracture was 5.3% (95%CI: 4.3%, 6.5%). In univariate analyses total LESS score at baseline was associated with the incidence rate of lower-extremity stress fracture during follow-up. For every additional movement error documented at baseline there was a 15% increase in the incidence rate of lower-extremity stress fracture during follow-up (IRR=1.15; 95%CI: 1.02, 1.31, p=0.025). Based on univariate analyses, several individual LESS items at baseline were also associated with the incidence rate of stress fracture during follow-up. Ankle flexion at initial contact (p=0.055), stance width at initial contact (p=0.026), asymmetrical landing at initial contact (p=0.003), trunk flexion at initial contact (p=0.036), and overall impression (p=0.021) were significantly associated with the incidence rate of stress fracture. In multivariable analyses controlling for sex and year of entry into the cohort, subjects who consistently landed flat-footed or heel-to-toe were 2.33 times (IRR=2.33; 95%CI: 1.36, 3.97, p=0.002) more likely to sustain a lower-extremity stress fracture during follow-up. Similarly, subjects who consistently demonstrated asymmetric landing at initial contact were 2.53 times (IRR=2.53; 95%CI: 1.34, 4.74, p=0.004) more likely to sustain a stress fracture during follow-up.
