max intensity) to exhaustion. Subject in the EXP were administrated BCAA (78ml/kgÂ·w) prior to the bout of cycle exercise. Fatigue substances, muscle damage substances and energy metabolism substances were measured before ingesting BCAAs and placebos, 10 min before exercise, 30 min into exercise, immediately after exercise, and 30 min after exercise. Data were analyzed by two-way repeated measure ANCOVA, correlation and statistical significance was set at p < 0.05. The following results were obtained from this study; 1. In the change of fatigue substances : Serotonin in the EXP tended to decreased at the 10 min before exercise, 30 min into exercise, post exercise, and recovery 30 min. Serotonin in the CON was significantly greater than the EXP at the10 min before exercise and recovery 30. Ammonia in the EXP was increased at the 10 min before exercise, 30 min into exercise, and post exercise, but significantly decreased at the recovery 30min (p < 0.05). Ammonia in the CON was significantly lower than the EXP at the 10 min before exercise, 30 min into exercise, and post exercise (p < 0.05). Lactate in the EXP was significantly increased at the 30 min into exercise and significantly decreased at the post exercise and recovery 30 min. Lactate in the CON was significantly lower than the EXP at the post exercise (p < 0.05). 2. In the change of muscle damage substances : CK in the EXP was decreased at the 10 min before exercise and increased at the 30 min into exercise and then decreased at the post exercise and recovery 30 min. CK in the CON was greater than the EXP. LDH in the EXP was decreased at the 10 min before exercise and increased at the 30 min into exercise and then decreased at the post exercise and recovery 30 min. LDH in the CON was higher than the EXP. 3. In the change of energy metabolism substances :Glucose in the EXP tended to decrease at the 10 min before exercise, 30 min into exercise, post exercise and recovery 30 min. Glucose in the CON was significantly greater than the EXP at the recovery 30 min (p < .05). FFA in both EXP and CON was increased at the post exercise and recovery 30 min. % increase for FFA in the EXP was greater than the CON at the post exercise and recovery 30 min. 4. The relationship of the fatigue substances, muscle damage substances and energy metabolism substances after endurance exercise indicated strongly a positive relationship between LDH and ammonia and a negative relationship between LDH and FFA in the EXP. Also, there were a strong negative relationship between glucose and FFA and a positive relationship between glucose and serotonin in the EXP. There was a strong positive relationship between CK and LDH and a strong negative relationship between FFA and glucose in the CON. These results indicate that supplementary BCAA decreased serum concentrations of the intramuscular enzymes as CK and LDH following exhaustive exercise. This observation suggests that BCAA supplementation may reduce the muscle damage associated with endurance exercise.
