Voltage-gated Na+ and Ca2+ conductances of freshly dissociated septal neurons were studied in the whole-cell configuration of the patch-clamp technique. All cells exhibited a large Na+ current with characteristic fast activation and inactivation time courses. Half-time to peak current at -20 mV was 0.44 +/- 0.18 ms and maximal activation of Na+ conductance occurred at 0 mV or more positive membrane potentials. The average value was 91 +/- 32 nS (approximately 11 mS cm-2). At all membrane voltages inactivation was well fitted by a single exponential that had a time constant of 0.44 +/- 0.09 ms at 0 mV. Recovery from inactivation was complete in approximately 900 ms at -80 mV but in only 50 ms at -120 mV. The decay of Na+ tail currents had a single time constant that at -80 mV was faster than 100 microseconds. Depolarization of septal neurons also elicited a Ca2+ current that peaked in approximately 6-8 ms. Maximal peak Ca2+ current was obtained at 20 mV, and with 10 mM external Ca2+ the amplitude was 0.35 +/- 0.22 nA. During a maintained depolarization this current partially inactivated in the course of 200-300 ms. The Ca2+ current was due to the activity of two types of conductances with different deactivation kinetics. At -80 mV the closing time constants of slow (SD) and fast (FD) deactivating channels were, respectively, 1.99 +/- 0.2 and 0.11 +/- 0.03 ms (25 degrees C). The two kinds of channels also differed in their activation voltage, inactivation time course, slope of the conductance-voltage curve, and resistance to intracellular dialysis. The proportion of SD and FD channels varied from cell to cell, which may explain the differential electrophysiological responses of intracellularly recorded septal neurons.
