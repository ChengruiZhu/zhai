 No instance of survival of spleen homeografts beyond the usual taking and persistence for 1 or 2 weeks common to most homeografts has been observed, although the possible advantages of consanguinity, age, and splenectomy were fully utilized. This is in sharp contrast to thyroid, sex gland, and adrenal cortex homeografts, with which one may expect 10 per cent to survive the 30 day period. It suggests that spleen is a stronger antigen and excites a greater degree of immunity more quickly. With autografts survival and growth are the rule, and failures are due to technical errors. Age is an important factor in the growth of autografts. The younger the rabbit the more growth is aided. This beneficial effect decreases gradually and becomes negligible after sexual maturity. Removal of the spleen is a powerful stimulus to the growth of transplants. The effect varies inversely with the age and usually is negligible after sexual maturity. The influence of age and splenectomy suggests that the spleen is most important in early life and after sexual maturity is either unimportant or its functions may readily be assumed by other tissues (hematopoietic). Anatomically the spleen is a highly complex structure, but biologically all the major elements of the spleen are simple as indicated by the uniform and marked regenerative capacity. There is a tendency for grafts to involute or atrophy with age, and grafts made in old rabbits without removal of the spleen may undergo complete atrophy. Grafts made in young rabbits, accompanied by splenectomy, have been observed for more than 3 years and may be said to be permanent. There is some evidence that subcutaneous autografts react to infections in the same way as the intact spleen.
