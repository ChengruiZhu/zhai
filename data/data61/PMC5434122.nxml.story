Contrary to general view that the MHC Class I and II are the kapellmeisters of recognition and response to antigens, there is another big player in that part of immunity, represented by CD1 glycoproteins. In contrast to MHC Class I or II, which present peptides, CD1 molecules present lipids. Humans express five CD1 proteins (CD1a-e), four of which (CD1a-d) are trafficked to the cell surface, where they may display lipid antigens to T-cell receptors. This interaction may lead to both non-cognate and cognate T cell help to B cells, the latter eliciting anti-lipid antibody response. All CD1 proteins can bind a broad range of structurally different exogenous and endogenous lipids, but each shows a preference to one or more lipid classes. This unorthodox binding behavior is the result of elaborate architectures of CD1 binding clefts and distinct intracellular trafficking routes. Together, these features make CD1 system a versatile player in immune response, sitting at the crossroads of innate and adaptive immunity. While CD1 system may be involved in numerous infectious, inflammatory, and autoimmune diseases, its involvement may lead to opposite outcomes depending on different pathologies. Despite these ambiguities and complexity, CD1 system draws growing attention and continues to show glimmers of therapeutic potential. In this review, we summarize the current knowledge about CD1 proteins, their structures, lipid-binding profiles, and roles in immunity, and evaluate the role of CD1 proteins in eliciting humoral immune response.
