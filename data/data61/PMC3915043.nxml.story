The androgen receptor (AR) stimulates and represses gene expression to promote the initiation and progression of prostate cancer. Here we report that androgen represses the miR-99a/let7c/125b-2 cluster through AR and anti-androgen drugs block the androgen-repression of the miRNA cluster. AR directly binds to the host gene of the miR-99a/let7c/125b-2 cluster, LINC00478. Expression of the cluster is repressed or activated by chromatin remodelers EZH2 or JMJD3 in the presence or absence of androgen, respectively. Bioinformatics analysis reveals a significant enrichment of targets of miR-99a, let-7c and miR-125b in androgen-induced gene sets, suggesting that downregulation of the miR-99a/let7c/125b-2 cluster by androgen protects many of their target mRNAs from degradation and indirectly assists in the gene induction. We validated the hypothesis with twelve potential targets of the miR-99a/let7c/125b-2 cluster induced by androgen: nine out of the twelve mRNAs are downregulated by the microRNA cluster. To ascertain the biological significance of this hypothesis we focused on IGF1R, a known prostate cancer growth factor that is induced by androgen and directly targeted by the miR-99a/let7c/125b-2 cluster. The androgen-induced cell proliferation is ameliorated to a similar extent as anti-androgen drugs by preventing the repression of the microRNAs or induction of IGF1R in androgen-dependent prostate cancer cells. Expression of a microRNA-resistant form of IGF1R protects these cells from inhibition by the miR-99a/let7c/125b-2 cluster. These results indicate that a thorough understanding of how androgen stimulates prostate cancer growth requires not only an understanding of genes directly induced/repressed by AR but also of genes indirectly induced by AR through the repression of key microRNAs.
