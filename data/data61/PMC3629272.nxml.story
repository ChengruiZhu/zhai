In this study, we used a substance P (SP) immunohistochemical method to analyze the expression localization of osteoprotegerin (OPG) and osteoprotegerin ligand (OPGL) in giant cell tumor (GCT) of the bone, and to detect the clinical significance of their expression. The data showed that the positive expression rate of OPG in the multinucleated giant cells (MGCs) and stromal cells (STCs) of GCT was 80.65 and 74.19%, respectively. The positive expression rate of OPG in MGCs was correlated with age and prognosis (P<0.05), but not in STCs. The strength of positive OPG expression in MGCs and STCs was negatively correlated with prognosis (rs=−0.397, P<0.05; rs=−0.390, P<0.05, respectively). The positive expression rate of OPGL in the MGCs and STCs was 41.94 and 67.74%, respectively. The positive expression rate of OPGL in the MGCs was correlated with age and prognosis (P<0.05); the strength of OPGL expression in MGCs was positively correlated with Campanicci’s grade and recurrence. Additionally, the positive expression rate of OPGL in STCs was correlated with age and Jaffe’s grade (P<0.05). The strength of OPGL expression in STCs was negatively correlated with Jaffe’s grade (rs=−0.534, P<0.05). In conclusion, OPG and OPGL are expressed in MGCs and STCs in GCT of the bone. The invasion of tumor cells was positively correlated with OPGL in MGCs, which confirmed that MGCs participate in the process of osteolytic destruction of GCT of bone.
