To assess changes of menstrual patterns, their causes, preventions and treatment methods after abdominal radical trachelectomy (ART), we recorded patientsâ€™ menstrual patterns after surgery and compared them with the conditions before surgery. Patients were divided into 3 groups based on their menstrual status post-trachelectomy:Group 1: menstrual patterns unchanged; Group 2: menstrual patterns changed without amenorrhea; and Group 3: amenorrhea. One hundred and twenty-nine patients were included: 39 (30.2%) women belonged to Group 1, 74 (57.4%) to Group 2 and 16 (12.4%) to Group 3. For patients in Group 2, the most common presenting symptom was decrease of menstrual volume (59, 79.7%), followed by a prolonged (33, 44.6%) menstrual bleeding. All of the changes in Group 2 and 12 cases in Group 3 were due to narrow of the remaining cervical os. Additionally, 9 and 12 patients, respectively, in Group 2 and 3, developed cervical stenosis. To maintain regular menstruation and prevent isthmic stenosis, 99 patients had tailed intrauterine devices (IUDs) placed in the uterine cavity. Incidence of cervical stenosis all happened in patients without IUDs placed in the uterine cavity. Menstrual condition improved in all patients except one after dilation of the new-cervix. Our results demonstrated that the majority of patients suffered from changes in menstrual patterns after ART. Narrowing of the remaining cervical canal was the main reason and could be treated by cervical dilation. The use of a tailed IUD was effective in the prevention of this complication.
