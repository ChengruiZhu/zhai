The incidence of osteoporosis-related fractures in Asian countries is steadily increasing. Optimizing osteoporosis treatment is especially important in Japan, where the rate of aging is increasing rapidlyelderly population is increasing rapidly and life expectancy is among the longest in the world. There are several therapies currently available in Japan for the treatment of postmenopausal osteoporosis, each with a unique risk/benefit profile. A novel selective estrogen receptor modulator, bazedoxifene (BZA), was recently approved for the treatment of postmenopausal osteoporosis in Japan. Results from a 2-year, phase 2 trial in postmenopausal Japanese women showed that BZA significantly improved lumbar spine and total hip bone mineral density compared with placebo, while maintaining endometrial and breast safety, consistent with results from 2 global, phase 3 trials including a 2-year osteoporosis prevention study and a 3-year osteoporosis treatment study. In the pivotal 3-year treatment study, BZA significantly reduced the incidence of new vertebral fractures compared with placebo; in a post hoc analysis of a subgroup of women at higher risk of fractures, BZA significantly reduced the risk of nonvertebral fractures compared with placebo and raloxifene. A 2-year extension of the 3-year treatment study demonstrated the sustained efficacy of BZA over 5 years of treatment. BZA was generally safe and well tolerated in these studies. In a “super-aging” society such as Japan, long-term treatment for postmenopausal osteoporosis is a considerable need. BZA may be considered as a first choice for younger women anticipating long-term treatment, and also an appropriate option for older women who are unable or unwilling to take bisphosphonates.
