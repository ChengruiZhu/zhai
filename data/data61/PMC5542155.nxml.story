All patients (100%) within this cohort had open femoral neck and iliac crest physis. The ischial tuberosity and greater trochanteric physes were open in 95% and 54% of the hips respectively. Although there was no significant difference between pre-operative and post-operative LCE and Tonnis angles, the alpha angle and HNOr were significantly improved (39.7° vs. 61.7°; p<0.001 and 0.19 vs. 0.17; p<0.001). Mean femoral version was 17.6°±7.4°, while the acetabular version at the 1:30 and 3:00 positions were 1.0°±6.7° and 14.0°±4.1°. The mean maximum alpha angle was 72.0°±12.1° and was located on average at the 1:15 position. Simulated ROM to bony impingement was 121.6°±12.1° for flexion, 33.8°±13.3° for internal rotation in 90 degrees of flexion. Mean follow-up was 18.6 months (range, 6.3 - 55.8 months). There was a mean 23.0-point improvement in the mHHS (pre-operative 69.4, post-operative 92.4; p<0.001) and a mean decrease of 3.5 points in the VAS for pain (pre-operative 5.2, post-operative 1.7; p<0.001). 93% percent of patients returned to their preinjury level of sports participation and did not feel limited by their hip. Multivariate analysis demonstrated that a greater pre-operative LCEA correlated with a greater change in the mHHS score (r=0.374, p=0.038). Similarly, a greater pre-operative AP alpha angle and change in the AP alpha angle also correlated with a greater change in the VAS pain score (r=0.411, p=0.038 and r=0.426,p=0.019, respectively). No major complications were noted, but 3 hips (2 patients) underwent revision hip arthroscopy during the follow-up period secondary to further development of cam-type FAI. There were no cases physeal growth arrest, growth disturbance, avascular necrosis.
