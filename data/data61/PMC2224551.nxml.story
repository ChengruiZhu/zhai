, the time of incubation, pH, the temperature, and the possible interference by oxidizing and reducing agents of tissues has been tested. 2. The method has been used to follow the uptake of intravenously injected horseradish peroxidase by 18 different tissues of the rat over a period of 30 hours. The highest concentration of the injected tracer enzyme was found in extracts of kidney, liver, bone marrow, thymus, and spleen. Considerable amounts were taken up by pancreas, prostate, epididymis, and small intestine. Lower concentrations were found in extracts of lung, stomach, heart, and skeletal muscle, aorta, skin, and connective tissue. No uptake was observed by brain and peripheral nerve tissue. 3. Tissue homogenates containing high concentrations of the injected peroxidase, in general also showed high or average activity of acid phosphatase. 4. Six hours after intravenous administration, the liver contained 27 per cent, the kidney 12 per cent, and the spleen, 1.4 per cent of the injected dose. 5. Approximately 20 per cent of the injected peroxidase was excreted in the urine during the first 6 hours, and the concentration of peroxidase in blood serum and urine fell exponentially during this time. After 6 hours, only low concentrations were excreted in the urine but low enzyme activity was still detectable after 30 hours. Approximately 6 per cent of the injected dose was excreted in the feces from 6 to 20 hours after administration. 6. After feeding through a stomach tube, low concentrations of peroxidase were found in blood serum and urine. Considerable variations in the extent of absorption from the gastrointestinal tract were observed in individual rats.
