In network theory, statistics are often considered to be stationary. While this assumption can be justified by experimental insights to some extent, it is often also made for reasons of simplicity. However, the time-dependence of statistical measures do matter in many cases. For example, time-dependent processes are examined for gene regulatory networks or networks of traders at stock markets. Periodically changing activity of remote brain areas is visible in the local field potential (LFP) and its influence on the spiking activity is currently debated in neuroscience. In experimental studies, however, it is often difficult to determine time-dependent statistics due to a lack of sufficient data representing the system at a certain time point. Theoretical studies, in contrast, allow the assessment of the time dependent statistics with arbitrary precision. We here extend the analysis of the correlation structure of a homogeneously connected EI-network consisting of binary model neurons to the case including a global sinusoidal input to the network. We show that the time-dependence of the covariances—to first order—can be explained analytically. We expose the mechanisms that modulate covariances in time and show how they are shaped by inhibitory recurrent network feedback and the low-pass characteristics of neurons. These generic properties carry over to more realistic neuron models.
