Poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) ([PLGA] 50:50 wt% PLA:PGA) films with a flat surface and with 27 nm, 190 nm, 300 nm, 400 nm, and 520 nm nanopatterns were fabricated using a cast-mold process. The nanopatterns were transferred from self-assembled polystyrene (PS) beads to PLGA films through polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) molds. The surface features, root-mean- square (RMS) roughness, and wettability of these PLGA surface features were studied by atomic force microscope (AFM) height scans, AFM z-sensor scans, and water contact angles, respectively. In order to evaluate the influence of the material topography alone (without changes in chemistry) for bone-cancer applications, both human healthy osteoblasts and human cancerous osteosarcoma cells were cultured on these PLGA surface features, and their densities were determined. Most importantly, compared to all other substrates, it was found that the 27 nm PLGA nanopatterns significantly increased the healthy osteoblast-to-osteosarcoma cell-density ratio. For these reasons, and since previous studies have highlighted that similar nanometer PLGA surface features decreased functions of other types of cancerous cells (specifically lung and breast), this study suggests that 27 nm PLGA nanopatterns should be further studied for a wide range of bone-cancer applications, particularly where healthy bone-cell functions need to be promoted over cancerous bone-cell functions.
