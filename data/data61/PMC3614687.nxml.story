Inherited thrombophilia is believed to be a multiple gene disease with more than one defect. We wanted to determine the association between single thrombophilic patterns and a variety of pregnancy diseases. 301 pregnant women were recruited for the present case-control study and were divided into two groups: A group (176 controls) and B group (125 cases). Patients belonging to the B group had one of the following: severe preeclampsia, HELLP syndrome, gestational hypertension, fetal growth restriction (FGR), intrauterine death, abruptio placentae, placenta previa, disseminated intravascular coagulopathy (DIC) and preterm labour. To detect MTHFR A1298C, MTHFR C677T, Factor V Leiden, PAI-1, Mutant Prothrombin G20210A, an inverse hybridization technology was used. Plasma homocysteine, Antithrombin III and protein levels S were determined. A modified functional activated protein C resistance was assayed. MTHFR C677T and hyperhomocysteinemia were more numerous than other thrombophilias. Deficiency in AT III was significantly linked with preeclampsia (Pearson Index and p value: 0.131 and 0.022, respectively) and disseminated intravascular coagulopathy (Pearson Index and p value: 0.138 and 0.016 respectively). Activated Protein C resistance was related to abruptio placentae (Pearson Index and p value: 0.159 and 0.005 respectively). Apart from the linkage between AT III deficiency and the occurrence of preeclampsia and disseminated intravascular coagulopathy, we obtained findings in contrast to some literature. In our case series, no association of preeclampsia with Factor V Leiden or with prothrombin gene mutation was found.
