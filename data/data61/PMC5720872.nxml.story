The mainstay of treatment of craniofacial dysplasia (CFD) remains surgery once clinical observation has been excluded. Nevertheless, disagreement remains about the type of surgical intervention (remodelling versus radical resection). The aim of this paper is to present our experience until 2013 comparing CFD management between 1980 and 2002 and between 2003 and 2013 and to propose our surgical algorithm. From January 2003 to December 2013, 41 new patients (18 males and 23 females) with histologically demonstrated CFD presented to our Department. Data were compared with those of 95 patients observed and/or treated between 1980 and 2002. Considering the last period, we noted that observation (26/41 patients) was the most used method; radical resection was performed in most cases (8/15 patients), but in proportion the numbers of patients undergoing bone shaving has increased (6% between 1980 and 2002 vs 15% between 2003 and 2013), while a decrease in the number of patients undergoing excision was seen (63% between 1980 and 2002 vs. 19% between 2003 and 2013). On this basis, we believe that radical resection is the only technique to obtain resolution of fibrous dysplasia. Wait-and-see is indicated in case of stable lesions. Reconstructive techniques allow obtaining adequate aesthetical and functional results; nevertheless, in most cases adjunctive surgical refinements are required and recovery time is higher than with surgical shaving, so that most patients prefer to perform remodelling. Nevertheless, in case of aggressive lesions radical resection is mandatory, except in paediatric patients with residual large defects in which it can be acceptable to try to resolve symptoms via bone shaving, reserving more aggressive treatments in case of relapse or after skeletal maturity.
