) are quite different, and one of the major differences is the growth rate at various larval stages. Nutrient utilization by midgut varies with sexes. However, the molecular basis of this variation is not clear. To understand the molecular mechanism, comparative proteomic approach was employed to investigate the variation of midgut proteomes between male and female silkworms. Totally, 32 proteins that were grouped into four categories were differentially expressed and subsequently identified by mass spectrometry. Gene ontology analysis revealed that these proteins were attributed with biological functions such as binding, catalytic, and transporter, and these proteins were involved in biological process such as cellular process, localization, and metabolic process. Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathway analysis revealed that these proteins were involved in pathways such as glycolysis, gluconeogenesis, oxidative phosphorylation, and purine metabolism. At transcription level, the expressional variation was confirmed for six identified proteins including muscle glycogen phosphorylase, uridine 5'-monophosphate synthase, cone cGMP-specific 3',5'-cyclic phosphodiesterase subunit alpha, ATP synthase, thiol peroxiredoxin, and serpin-2. This study provides useful information for understanding the mechanisms of nutrient absorption and the proteinâ€“protein interaction in the silkworm.
