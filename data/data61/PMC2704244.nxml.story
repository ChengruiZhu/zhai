To evaluate the latent risk of acidosis in commercially available total parenteral nutrition (TPN) products, three types of commercially available TPN products were compared in postoperative patients. Sixty-four hospitalized patients with gastro-intestinal disease who undertook curative gastro intestinal resection were studied prospectively and administered with TPN solutions. Three types of commercially available TPN products were assigned randomly to eligible patients. Serial studies of blood acid-base status, serum electrolytes, and urinary acid-base status were conducted in the three groups administered with different TPN solutions. Patients received appropriate electrolytic solutions on the operation day and TPN solution from 2 to 7 days after operation. There were no differences among any of the serum electrolytes in the three groups. In one group, urinary pH decreased slightly and urinary net acid excretion (NAE) increased significantly after administration. This TPN product contains about 40Â mEq/L of non-metabolizable acid to avoid the Maillard reaction that produces a complex of glucose and amino acids. Urinary NAE did not change in the other two groups. These TPN products do not use non-metabolizable acid to adjust pH. The present results suggest that the non-metabolizable acid may be a risk factor of metabolic acidosis.
