Selective targeting of soluble proteins to cellular membranes relies on different mechanisms such as receptor-mediated recruitment or direct binding to specific lipids. A new paradigm has been recently proposed, according to which membrane binding of some proteins is driven by the geometrical and physical properties of the membranes, namely the membrane curvature and lipid packing in the external membrane monolayer. Specifically, several proteins referred to as the membrane curvature sensors have been shown to preferentially bind strongly curved membranes. This mode of protein binding is especially relevant for such fundamental cell processes as endocytosis and carrier generation from ER and Golgi Complex, which involve shaping initially flat membranes into strongly curved ones. A subset of the curvature sensors contains amphipathic or hydrophobic domains that shallowly insert into the membrane. Here we explore computationally the detailed physical mechanism underlying the membrane binding by such proteins and demonstrate that their membrane affinity is not determined by the curvature per se but rather by the membrane stress, independently of the way the stress has been generated. Hence, the significance of our work is in elucidating the relationship between the membrane binding of peripheral proteins carrying shallowly inserting domains and the membrane stresses.
