A 20 years old national triple jumping athlete fell during daily sports exercises which consist of jumping to the medial and lateral side trying to catch a sports ball bouncing from the wall while his right foot was inverted and in plantar flexion. The patient was admitted to our emergency service. The physical examination revealed that the hindfoot was displaced medially. The neurological examination was intact and there was no sign of dermal injury. After the radiological examination the diagnosis was isolated subtalar dislocation. The dislocation was reduced with longitudinal traction with the knee was in flexion. The MR imaging did not reveal any chondral damage. The choice of treatment was conservative. After 4 days as the edema subsided, a short leg cast was applied for four weeks. Then, the cast was removed and active range of motion exercises were initiated. The first 25 days consisted of exercises with rubber band, bottle rolling under the foot. The second phase included walking in the pool and the patient was asked to start weight bearing partially. The patient went on with proprioception and strengthening exercises. Later, kinesiologic taping was also added to the therapy. He changed his jumping foot and started his routine training program with the team after 170 days. He participated in his first official competition 16 months after the injury. At the 28. month, he broke the national record in the National Interuniversities Athletics Games. 2 months later, he got the third place in the World Athletics Championship.
