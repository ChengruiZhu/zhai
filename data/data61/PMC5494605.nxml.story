Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is an early and key process in the metastatic cascade during the progression of colorectal cancer (CRC). The aim of the present study was to identify deregulated EMT-related microRNAs (miRNAs/miRs) of CRC and assess the effect of differentially expressed miRNAs on the prognosis of patients with CRC. Genome-wide expression profiling of miRNAs was assessed in 3 EMT-negative and 3 EMT-positive CRC tissues. Differentially expressed miRNA was further validated in 90 pairs of CRC and corresponding paracarcinoma tissues using the reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR). A total of 6 miRNAs (miR-10a-5p miR-204-3p, miR-1224-3p, miR-193a-3p, miR-365a-3p and miR-3678-3p) were identified to be differentially expressed between different EMT statuses of CRC tissues. Following validation using RT-qPCR, 3 miRNAs (miR-10a-5p, miR-365a-3p and miR-193a-3p) were selected for subsequent studies. The expression levels of miR-10a-5p, miR-193a-3p and miR-365a-3p were markedly increased compared with levels in corresponding paracarcinoma tissues. Survival analyses revealed that down-regulation of miR-193a-3p was associated with worse prognosis of patients with CRC, particularly in female and older patients. The results of the present study indicate that miR-193a-3p may be an EMT-related biomarker and serve as a novel prognostic factor for CRC.
