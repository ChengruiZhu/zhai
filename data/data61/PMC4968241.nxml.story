For the major and minor league intervention study, one Major and Minor League organization served as the intervention (INT) team, which encompassed Rookie League, Fall Ball, Class A, AA, AAA and major league rosters (6 total teams). A total of 213 athletes consented to participate: Minor League: N = 173 players and Majors League: N = 40. Weekly compliance, injury incidence and time loss due to injury was compared to the HITS database (age, skill matched control group). The average weighted utilization of the injury prevention program was 25.30 utilizations for the uninjured group compared to 13.53 in the injured group (p=0.09). In the majors, there were 2 HS injuries in the INT vs. 79 in the CON (IR: .025 INT vs .068 CON, p < 0.05); constituting a 25% reduction in HS injury. In the minors, there were 7 HS injuries in the INT vs. 297 in the CON (IR: .039 INT vs. .065 CON, p < 0.05), constituting a 40% reduction in the minor league HS injuries. There was a significant reduction in time loss due to injury for both the major and minor league INT players compared to the CON. For the Major League INT, there were 9 vs. 25.9 days lost in the CON group, resulting in a 65.3% reduction in time loss (p<0.05). The Minor League INT reported a similar finding: 11.63 vs. 21.3 days lost to injury in the CON group, resulting in a 45.3% reduction in time loss (p<0.05).
