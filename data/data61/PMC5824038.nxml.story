The use of high-risk human papillomavirus (HPV) testing for surveillance and clinical applications is increasing globally, and it is important that tests are evaluated to ensure they are fit for this purpose. In this study, the performance of a new HPV genotyping test, the Papilloplex high-risk HPV (HR-HPV) test, was compared to two well-established genotyping tests. Preliminary clinical performance was also ascertained for the detection of CIN2+ in a disease-enriched retrospective cohort. A panel of 500 cervical liquid-based cytology samples with known clinical outcomes were tested by the Papilloplex HR-HPV test. Analytical concordance was compared to two assays: a Linear Array (LA) HPV genotyping test and an Optiplex HPV genotyping test. The initial clinical performance for the detection for CIN2+ samples was performed and compared to that of two clinically validated HPV tests: a RealTime High-Risk HPV test (RealTime) and a Hybrid Capture 2 HPV test (HC2). High agreement for HR-HPV was observed between the Papilloplex and LA and Optiplex HPV tests (97 and 95%, respectively), with kappa values for HPV16 and HPV18 being 0.90 and 0.81 compared to the LA and 0.70 and 0.82 compared to the Optiplex test. The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value of the Papilloplex test for the detection of CIN2+ were 92, 54, 33, and 96%, respectively, and very similar to the values observed with RealTime and HC2. The Papilloplex HR-HPV test demonstrated a analytical performance similar to those of the two HPV genotyping tests at the HR-HPV level and the type-specific level. The preliminary data on clinical performance look encouraging, although further longitudinal studies within screening populations are required to confirm these findings.
