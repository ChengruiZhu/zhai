Many people have experienced lightheadedness when standing up, yet the exact cause of this phenomenon remains unknown. For some people, lightheadedness occurs because of anomalies in the blood pressure control system, which keeps blood flow and pressure at homeostasis. One way to explore this system is via mathematical modeling, which can offer valuable insights into the complex dynamic processes. This study develops a framework for modeling activity of the baroreceptor neurons. The models consist of three components reflecting three physiological mechanisms relating blood pressure to the baroreceptor firing rate: modulation of arterial blood pressure causes dilation of the arterial wall, stimulating mechanoreceptors within the baroreceptor nerve endings, emanating from the aortic arch and carotid sinus, which in turn modulates the firing rate of the baroreceptor neurons. This signal is integrated in the brain stem, stimulating baroreflex efferents to counteract the pressure increase. In this study, we review the main static and dynamic features of the baroreceptor firing activity, and show, using a combination of modeling techniques and rat aortic baroreceptor data, how to build a computationally efficient, yet biologically correct model. These models are important components for describing efferent responses, such as: heart rate, contractility or stroke volume.
