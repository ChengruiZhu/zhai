Thirty-two consecutive adolescent athletes (28 boys and 4 girls) with a mean age of 16.1 years (range 13.2-17.9 years, SD=1.3) met inclusion criteria. Twenty-nine patients (91%) had a traumatic event associated with the onset of their shoulder pain, and 27 of these patients (93%) had no symptoms prior to the trauma. The most common tendon affected was the supraspinatus (21 patients, 66%). All seven subscapularis injuries were repaired in open fashion, while all other tears were repaired arthroscopically with either a single-row or double-row configuration depending on tear size and anatomy. Of the 18 partial-thickness tears, eight (44%) were measured intraoperatively to be 50-75% of the footprint, and the remaining ten tears (56%) encompassed greater than 75% of the footprint from medial to lateral. Twenty-seven patients (84%) d the outcome questionnaires at a mean of 6.2 years after surgery (range 2-10 years, SD=2.6 years). The mean ASES score was 93 (range 65-100, SD=9), mean WORC was 89% (range 60%-100%, SD=13%), and mean numeric pain rating was 0.3 (range 0-3, SD=0.8). Table 1 Overall, 25 patients (93%) were able to return to the same level of play or higher. In overhead athletes, 13 patients (93%) were able to return to the same level of play, but 8 patients (57%) were forced to switch positions due to difficulty with throwing. There were no surgical complications, but two patients did undergo a second operation during the study period.
