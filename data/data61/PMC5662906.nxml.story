The aim of the present study was to analyze potential therapy targets for prostate cancer using integrated analysis of two gene expression profiles. First, gene expression profiles GSE38241 and GSE3933 were downloaded from the Gene Expression Omnibus database. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between prostate cancer and normal control samples were identified using the Linear Models for Microarray Data package. Pathway enrichment analysis of DEGs was performed using Gene Ontology and the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes. Furthermore, protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks of DEGs were constructed, on the basis of the Search Tool for the Retrieval of Interacting Genes/Proteins database. The Molecular Complex Detection was utilized to perform module analysis of the PPI networks. In addition, transcriptional regulatory networks were constructed on the basis of the associations between transcription factors (TFs) and target genes. A total of 529 DEGs were identified, including 129 upregulated genes that were primarily associated with to the cell cycle. Additionally, 400 downregulated genes were identified, which were principally enriched in the pathways associated with vascular smooth muscle contraction and focal adhesion. Cell Division Cycle Associated 8, Cell Division Cycle 45, Ubiquitin Conjugating Enzyme E2 C and Thymidine Kinase 1 were identified as hub genes in the upregulated sub-network. Furthermore, the upregulated TF
