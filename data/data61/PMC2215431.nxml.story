The effects of the n-alkyl derivatives of guanidine on the frog neuromuscular junction were studied using the two-microelectrode voltage clamp and other electrophysiological techniques. Methyl-, ethyl- , and propylguanidine stimulated the nerve-evoked release of transmitter. However, amyl-and octylguanidine had no apparent presynaptic action. All of the derivatives blocked the postsynaptic response to acetylcholine, the potency sequence being octyl-greater than amyl-greater than propyl-, methyl-greater than ethylguanidine. Methyl- and octylguanidine did not protect the receptor from alpha- bungarotoxin block, suggesting that these compounds do not bind to the receptor but probably block the ionic channel. Methyl-, ethyl-, and propylguanidine shortened inward endplate currents but prolonged outward currents. Amylguanidine prolonged both inward and outward endplate currents, and the currents became biphasic at negative membrane potentials. Octylguanidine increased the rate of decay of endplate currents at all potentials. All of the derivatives blocked inward endplate currents more markedly than outward currents, resulting in a highly nonlinear current-voltage relation. Methyl-, ethyl-, and propylguanidine reversed the voltage dependence of endplate current decay, while amyl-and octylguanidine reduced the voltage dependence of endplate current decay. Octylguanidine appears to block the ionic channel in both the open and the closed state. The block of the open channel follows pseudo-first-order kinetics with a forward rate constant of 4-6 X 10(7) M-1 s-1.
