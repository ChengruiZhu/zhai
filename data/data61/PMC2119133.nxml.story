In immature thymocytes, T cell receptor for antigen (TCR) mobilization leads to an active T cell suicide process, apoptosis, which is involved in the selection of the T cell repertoire. We have proposed that inappropriate induction of such a cell death program in the mature CD4+ T cell population could account for both early qualitative and late quantitative CD4+ T lymphocyte defects of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected individuals (Ameisen, J.C., and A. Capron. 1991. Immunol. Today. 4:102). Here, we report that the selective failure of CD4+ T cells from 59 clinically asymptomatic HIV-infected individuals to proliferate in vitro to TCR mobilization by major histocompatibility complex class II-dependent superantigens and to pokeweed mitogen (PWM) is due to an active CD4+ T cell death process, with the biochemical and ultrastructural features of apoptosis. Activation-induced cell death occurred only in the CD4+ T cell population from HIV-infected asymptomatic individuals and was not observed in T cells from any of 58 HIV-seronegative controls, including nine patients with other acute or chronic infectious diseases. Activation-induced CD4+ T cell death was prevented by cycloheximide, cyclosporin A, and a CD28 monoclonal antibody (mAb). The CD28 mAb not only prevented apoptosis but also restored T cell proliferation to stimuli, including PWM, superantigens, and the tetanus and influenza recall antigens. These findings may have implications for the understanding of the pathogenesis of acquired immune deficiency syndrome and for the design of specific therapeutic strategies.
