Vertical binocular disparity is a source of distance information allowing the portrayal of the layout and 3D metrics of the visual space. The role of vertical disparity in the perception of depth, size, curvature, or slant of surfaces was revealed in several previous studies using cue conflict paradigms. In this study, we varied the configuration of stereo-cameras to investigate how changes in the horizontal and vertical disparity fields, conflicting with the vergence cue, affect perceived distance and depth. In four experiments, observers judged the distance of a cylinder displayed in front of a large fronto-parallel surface. Experiment 1 revealed that the presence of a background surface decreases the uncertainty in judgments of distance, suggesting that observers use the relative horizontal disparity between the target and the background as a cue to distance. Two other experiments showed that manipulating the pattern of vertical disparity affected both distance and depth perception. When vertical disparity specified a nearer distance than vergence (convergent cameras), perceived distance and depth were underestimated as compared with the condition where vertical disparity was congruent with vergence cues (parallel cameras). When vertical disparity specified a further distance than vergence, namely an infinite distance, distance and depth were overestimated. The removal of the vertical distortion lessened the effect on perceived distance. Overall, the results suggest that the vertical disparity introduced by the specific camera configuration is mainly responsible for the effect. These findings outline the role of vertical disparity in distance and depth perception and support the use of parallel cameras for designing stereograms.
