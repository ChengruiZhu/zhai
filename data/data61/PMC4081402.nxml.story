The present study sought to characterize the role of macrophage inflammatory protein-3α (MIP-3α) in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients with early recurrence or metastasis after primary pulmonary resection. Follow-up examinations were conducted for 203 NSCLC patients with primary pulmonary resection for two years post-operatively, and data was also collected for 20 healthy subjects. Serum MIP-3α levels were determined prior to surgery and at post-operative days (PODs) 30, 90 and 180, and the relevant clinical and operative variables were collected. Serum MIP-3α was measured using a commercially available enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. There were no significant differences in age, gender and histological type among all groups (P>0.05). Serum MIP-3α levels on POD 180 were significantly higher in the recurrence group than in the non-recurrence group and healthy subjects (P=0.001). There was no significant difference in the serum MIP-3α level at PODs 90 and 180 in the patients with or without adjuvant chemotherapy (P>0.05). The recurrence rate in the high serum MIP-3α level group was 41.67%, much higher than the 23.53% observed in the low level group (P=0.006). The patients with high serum levels of MIP-3α had a significantly shorter overall recurrence-free time compared with those with low levels (P=0.004). Multivariate Cox’s regression analyses showed that only serum MIP-3α level was significant, with a hazard ratio of 1.061, a 95% confidence interval of 1.044–1.078 and a P-value of 0.001. The serum MIP-3α level in the patients with liver and bone metastases were remarkably higher than those with recurrence at other sites. The high post-operative serum MIP-3α levels were associated with an increased risk of post-operative early recurrence or metastasis in the lung cancer patients, specifically in those with bone or liver metastases.
