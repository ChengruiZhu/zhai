Biochemical networks, consisting of biomolecules such as proteins and DNA that chemically and physically interact with one another, are the processing devices of life. Metabolic networks allow living cells to process food, while signal transduction pathways and gene regulatory networks allow living cells to process information. Experiments in recent years have demonstrated that these networks are often very “noisy”: the protein concentrations often fluctuate strongly. However, how this “biochemical noise” affects the growth rate or fitness of an organism is poorly understood. We present here a mathematical model that makes it possible to predict quantitatively how protein concentration fluctuations affect the growth rate of a cell population. The model predicts that fluctuations reduce the growth rate when evolution has tuned the average protein concentration to the level that maximizes the growth rate; however, when the average concentration deviates sufficiently from the optimal one, fluctuations can actually enhance the growth rate. Our analysis also predicts that the optimal design of a regulatory network is determined by the trade-off between the cost of synthesizing the proteins that constitute the regulatory network and the benefit of reducing the fluctuations in the network that it controls. Our predictions can be tested in wild-type and synthetic networks.
