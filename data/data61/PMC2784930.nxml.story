Alternative splicing is an important mechanism for regulating gene function in complex organisms, and has been shown to play a key role in human diseases such as cancer. Recently, high-throughput technologies have been used in an effort to detect alternative splicing events throughout the human genome. However, validating the results of these automated detection methods, and showing that the minor splice forms they detected play an important role in regulating biological functions, have traditionally required time-consuming experiments. In this study we show that such regulatory functions can very often be detected by a distinctive pattern of strong selection on RNA sequence motifs within the alternatively spliced region. We have measured this “RNA selection pressure ratio” (RSPR) across 28 animal species representing 400 million years of evolution, and show that this metric successfully predicts known patterns of alternative splicing, and also have validated its predictions experimentally. For example, whereas high-RSPR alternative splices were found experimentally to undergo tissue-specific regulation in 75% of cases, only 20% of low-RSPR cases were found to be tissue-specific. Using RSPR, we have predicted over 600 human and mouse alternative splicing events that appear to be under strong selection. These data should be valuable for biologists seeking to understand the functional effects and underlying mechanisms of splicing regulation.
