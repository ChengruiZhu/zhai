Germ cell tumours are the most common malignancy among young men; cryptorchidism is a possible risk factor for the development of testicular cancer. Psycho-oncology studies indicate that diagnostic delay can often be explained by different social conditions and that symptoms worsened under lack of appropriate treatment can lead to an urgent admission to the hospital. Nevertheless, germ cell tumours are considered curable malignancies even in advanced stages since the introduction of a chemotherapy regimen based on bleomycin, etoposide and cisplatin. Cell lines derived from germ cell tumours are sensitive to cisplatin-based treatment more than other solid cancers, which is reflected in the good clinical response. We report an unusual manifestation of malignancy in an adult man presenting with a metastatic seminoma of the left testicle. The large ulcerate and necrotic mass suggested a secondary infection from a tumour site. The patient reported surgical orchiopexy for left cryptorchidism in his childhood. Despite worsening of physical features, he had not sought help at the hospital for social reasons. The patient achieved complete clinical remission after receiving standard chemotherapy, and a good objective response of the primitive mass was clearly visible. Complete response was persistent at the 30-month clinical follow-up. The chemotherapy administration was later complicated by acute haemorrage in the site of the primitive tumour that needed urgent surgical management; in addition to this, the artificial graft material was rejected and the arterial prosthesis had to be removed.
