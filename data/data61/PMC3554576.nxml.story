Large-scale chromosomal rearrangements are often associated with dramatic phenotypic changes such as cancer cell formation. It has been speculated that large-scale chromosomal rearrangements may play a crucial role at the early stages of adaptation, since they can quickly change the expression level of multiple genes or even a whole pathway by changing the gene copy number. Nonetheless, it remains unclear whether such mutations can be stably maintained in populations, especially in a fluctuating environment. Here we characterize an adaptive copper-tolerant phenotype in a wild yeast population. We discovered that the adaptive phenotype was contributed to by two large-scale chromosomal rearrangements, which increased the copy number of key components of copper regulation, including a crucial transcriptional activator, Cup2. We further identified three previously unknown downstream targets of Cup2 that also contributed to copper tolerance. Finally, we conducted an evolution experiment to test the stability of the rearranged chromosomes under conditions of relaxed selection. We found that the rearranged chromosomes returned back to the original configuration at a high frequency, and the wild type-like chromosome became fixed in all the evolved cultures. Our results suggest that chromosomal rearrangements can provide a reversible mechanism for cells when adapting to a fluctuating environment.
