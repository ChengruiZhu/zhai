Enhanced recovery programs (ERP) represent a multimodal approach to perioperative patient care. The benefits of ERP are well demonstrated in colorectal surgery and Enhanced Recovery After Surgery (ERAS®) programs, that epitomise the ERP concept, have being introduced in different specialties, including vascular, gastric, pancreatic, urogynecologic and orthopaedic surgery. However, no ERP has been proposed for head and neck surgery. We developed an expert-opinion-based ERP for laryngeal surgery based on the key principles of colorectal surgery ERAS®. Twenty-four patients undergoing major laryngeal surgery (total and partial laryngectomies or surgical removal of oropharyngeal tumour with muscle flap reconstruction) were treated according to such an ERP protocol, which differed under several respects from our previous standard practice (described in 70 consecutive patients who underwent major laryngeal surgery before ERP implementation. The adherence rate to the different ERP items is reported. Adherence to ERP items was high. Nutritional assessment, antibiotic prophylaxis, postoperative nausea and vomit (PONV) prophylaxis and postoperative speech therapy targets were applied as required in 100% of cases. Some ERP items (antibiotic prophylaxis, intraoperative infusion rate, and postoperative speech therapy) were already frequently implemented before ERP adoption. Postoperative medical complications occurred in 8.3% of patients. Our expert opinion-based ERP protocol for major laryngeal surgery proved feasible. The degree of benefit deriving from its implementation has yet to be assessed.
