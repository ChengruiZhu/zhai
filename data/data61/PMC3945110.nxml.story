Heme is the prosthetic group at the core of the oxygen carrier metalloprotein hemoglobin. Heme consists of a tetrapyrrole called porphyrin bound to an iron ion. It is synthesized by the heme biosynthetic pathway, which is common to all eukaryotes and most prokaryotes. Porphobilinogen deaminase, an enzyme in the heme biosynthetic pathway, catalyzes the formation of a linear tetrapyrrole product, 1-hydroxymethylbilane, from four units of porphobilinogen. In this study we carried out molecular dynamics simulations to understand the structural changes that the enzyme undergoes while catalyzing this reaction. There are three segments to the study: 1) understanding the changes in the enzyme when the porphobilinogen units get attached to the dipyrromethane cofactor, thereby forming a polypyrrole chain; 2) exit of the product from the active site of the enzyme via steered molecular dynamics; and 3) the relaxation of the enzyme to the initial stage to resume its catalytic cycle. Molecular dynamics simulations of the protein through the different stages of pyrrole chain elongation gives insight into the motions of domains, active site loop and role of conserved active site residues in facilitating the accommodation of the polypyrrole chain. In addition to this, we propose a possible exit path for the product and demonstrate the relaxation of the enzyme after the exit of the product to resume the catalytic cycle.
