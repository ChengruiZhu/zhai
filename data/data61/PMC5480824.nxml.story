The honeybee olfactory system offers the opportunity to study different levels of learning complexity in a small size network. Odour information is transferred from the antennae to the antennal lobes, and from there to the mushroom bodies and the lateral horn via parallel medial and lateral tracts of projection neurons. Although much progress has been made in understanding olfactory coding in the bee brain, the precise contribution of the lateral pathway in olfactory learning is still unclear. To understand the computational mechanisms underpinning the lateral antennal lobe tract, we modelled local computation and non-associative plasticity within glomeruli in the antennal lobe and the lateral horn where they were additionally modulated by octopamine to achieve associative learning. We establish that the connectivity within the antennal lobe (that is shaped by non-associative plasticity) can also be modified by inhibitory feedback neurons. This makes output patterns of antennal lobe more separable and sparser. Our modelling indicates that bees, using the lateral pathway, might learn to solve positive patterning tasks in addition to elemental learning and olfactory generalisation without the contribution of the mushroom bodies. Yet, the model cannot account for negative patterning, thus indicating that the mushroom bodies may be required for this discrimination. Our modelling approach allows us to link changes in structural organization of honeybees' antennal lobes with behavioural performance over the course of their life.
