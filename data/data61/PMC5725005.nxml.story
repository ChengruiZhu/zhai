Tuberculous meningitis (TBM) is caused by tuberculosis infection of of the meninges, which are the membrane systems that encircle the brain, with a high morbidity and mortality rate. It is challenging to diagnose TBM among other types of meningitis, such as viral meningitis, bacterial meningitis and cryptococcal meningitis. We aimed to identify metabolites that are differentially expressed between TBM and the other types of meningitis by a global metabolomics analysis. The cerebrospinal fluids (CSF) from 50 patients with TBM, 17 with viral meningitis, 17 with bacterial meningitis, and 16 with cryptococcal meningitis were analyzed using ultra high performance liquid chromatography coupled with quadrupole time of flight mass spectrometry (UHPLC-QTOF-MS). A total of 1161 and 512 features were determined in positive and negative electrospray ionization mode, respectively. A clear separation between TBM and viral, bacterial or cryptococcal meningitis was achieved by orthogonal projections to latent structures-discriminate analysis (OPLS-DA) analysis. Potential metabolic markers and related pathways were identified, which were mainly involved in the metabolism of amino acid, lipids and nucleosides. In summary, differential metabolic profiles of the CSF exist between TBM and other types of meningitis, and potential metabolic biomarkers were identified to differentiate TBM from other types of meningitis.
