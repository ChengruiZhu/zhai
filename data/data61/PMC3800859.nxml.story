Malaria is one of the dreaded global killer diseases especially in the poor, forested, hilly, remote regions with little medical facilities. About 2 million malaria cases are estimated to occur in India annually as per the National malaria research institute study, but many more unreported cases also occur. Each leads to treatment cost of Rs. 1,000/ (one thousand) on average. This implies Rs. 2 billion drug market. Considering that the proposed local medicinal plants based drug will cut the treatment cost by at least 50% , the business potential with 100% replacement would be Rs. 1 billion at least. The formula is basically clinically found successful by Bombay Hospital scientists. The pharmaceutical companies do not invest in the market “at the bottom of the pyramid” due to thin margins/ loss risk. Thus, of the patented malaria medicine developed by National Research Development Council (NRDC) named “Ayush 64” (www.nrdcindia.com/pages/ayush64.htm), hardly any companies bought marketing rights or did many sales. There is huge market in N. E. India/ Africa/ S. America! Ayurveda has proven medicines to treat malaria viz. Mahasudarshan Churna, Tribhuvan kirti & Parijat vati, who treat “Visham jwara” its Ayurvedic indication. However, these are unknown, unavailable, costly & unused in the tribal areas so not popularized. Folk medicines reported, but rarely, to treat malaria include Neem, Kalmegh & Harsingar, where in a clinical study in Mumbai on 120 Malaria patients, 77% showed complete parasite eradication within 7 days of treatment with the leaf paste, and is also found safe. We also found it effective in our work in Balangir in 2011, besides also by the other NGOs in Orissa viz. Sambandh & FRLHT (www.iaim.edu.in), mainly as a prophylactic. About 30% of the family expenses today spent on Malaria treatment will be cut by about 50%, saving about Rs.2,500/ annually to spend on food, health & education. About 10% productivity will also grow, taking total benefit to Rs.4, 000/ annually, as each person per family spend lying on bed about 10 15 days in Malaria fever. This will be at a cost of just Rs. 500/ making the output: input ratio 1.5, than the total loss now! Also, local & common plants sources, simple technology ensure continued availability & low cost unlike Artemissin drug.
