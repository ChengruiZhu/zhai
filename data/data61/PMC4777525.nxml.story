How infected cells respond to a virus during the first minutes to hours after infection can determine whether a disease develops and influences the hostâ€™s long-term survival. In mammals, unlike plants and flies that use small RNAs to fight viral infections, virus-induced interferon responses are a critical early event resulting in broad protection against infection. Interferon is a secreted host protein that binds to receptors on the surface of infected and uninfected cells and activates biochemical pathways that profoundly change the expression of hundreds of cellular genes, including those encoding microRNAs. The antiviral functions of only a handful of these genes are understood, and it is not known how the majority contribute to broadly protect against many different viruses. In this study, we uncover an interferon-regulated microRNA (miR-342-5p) that contributes to broad host cell immunity against infection through the cholesterol biosynthesis pathway. We show that miR-342-5p does this through a multihit strategy, turning down the master regulator of sterol biosynthesis as well as several specifically targeted enzymes within the pathway. A wide range of viruses depend on a number of the metabolite side-branches of the sterol biosynthesis pathway for their replication. Notably, our study reveals that by utilising multihit targeting of key branch-points in a single pathway, miR-342-5p is able to inhibit the replication of unrelated, clinically significant pathogens ranging from Herpes to Flu viruses.
