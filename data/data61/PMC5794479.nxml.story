Procalcitonin (PCT) is a predictive marker for the occurrence of bacterial infection and the decision to terminate antibiotic treatment in critically ill patients. An unusual increase in PCT, regardless of infection, has been observed during extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) support. We evaluated trends and the predictive value of PCT levels in adult cardiogenic shock during treatment with ECMO. We reviewed the clinical records of 38 adult cardiogenic shock patients undergoing veno-arterial ECMO support between January 2014 and December 2016. The exclusion criteria were age <18 years, pre-ECMO infection, and less than 48 hours of support. The mean patient age was 56.7±14.7 years and 12 (31.6%) patients were female. The mean duration of ECMO support was 9.0±7.6 days. The rates of successful ECMO weaning and survival to discharge were 55.3% (n=21) and 52.6% (n=20), respectively. There were 17 nosocomial infections in 16 (42.1%) patients. Peak PCT levels (mean 25.6±9.4 ng/mL) were reached within 48 hours after initiation of ECMO support and decreased to ≤5 ng/mL within one week. The change in PCT levels was not useful in predicting the occurrence of new nosocomial infections during the ECMO run. However, a PCT level >10 ng/mL during the first week of ECMO support was significantly associated with mortality (p<0.01). The change in PCT level was not useful in predicting new infection during ECMO support. However, higher PCT levels within the first week of the ECMO run are associated with significantly higher mortality.
