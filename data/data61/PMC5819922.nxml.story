 target gene prediction. Functional annotation analysis of the predicted targets was performed using Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) databases. As a result, significantly impaired left ventricular diastolic function was detected in the 12-month-old SHRs, alongside increased myocyte cross-sectional area and percentage area of fibrosis, elevated reactive oxygen species production and reduced microvessel density (P<0.05). Compared with the 3-month-old SHRs, 21 miRNAs were significantly upregulated and five miRNAs were downregulated in 12-month-old rats (P<0.05). Eight upregulated, remodeling-associated miRNAs, including rno-miR-132-3p, rno-miR-182, rno-miR-208b-3p, rno-miR-212-3p, rno-miR-214-3p, rno-miR-218a-5p, rno-miR-221-3p and rno-miR-222-3p, underwent bioinformatics analysis. The target genes were significantly enriched in 688 GO terms and 39 KEGG pathways, including regulation of peptidyl-tyrosine phosphorylation, regulation of protein serine/threonine kinase activity, adrenergic signaling in cardiomyocytes, ErbB signaling pathway, mTOR signaling pathway, FoxO signaling pathway, Ras signaling pathway, insulin secretion, adipocytokine signaling pathway, HIF-1 signaling pathway, Rap1 signaling pathway, VEGF signaling pathway and TNF signaling pathway. Collectively, the present study identified a dysregulated miRNA profile in aging SHRs, which targeted numerous signaling pathways associated with cardiac hypertrophy, autophagy, insulin metabolism, angiogenesis and inflammatory response.
