The aim of this study was to analyse audiometric and speech perception outcomes after cochlear implantation (CI) in adult and elderly patients in the first year post-CI activation. We evaluated 42 subjects who underwent CI at the Otorhinolaryngological Clinic of Padua Hospital. The subjects enrolled were post-lingually deafened patients who were unilaterally implanted for bilateral, severe-to-profound hearing loss. The overall sample was divided into three groups according to the age at the time of implantation: group A (35-49 years), group B (50-64 years) and group C (â‰¥ 65 years). The subjects were assessed, both before and after surgery (at months 1, 3, 6 and 12), using pure tone audiometry, speech audiometry and speech perception tests and the CAP questionnaire. Statistical analysis of outcomes was using a Student's t-test for paired data. In all study groups a significant improvement was demonstrated in auditory performance examinations post-CI compared to the pre-operative scores. All subjects in all age groups obtained significant improvements in PTA scores before surgery and post-CI activation. Comparison of PTA values among the three age groups did not reveal any significant difference. Considerable improvement was obtained even in the speech audiometry thresholds in all groups at follow-up, with no significant differences between groups. The speech perception examination and CAP questionnaire showed good progress in all study groups, although younger patients tended to achieve more complex categories than older ones. In conclusion, CI is an effective treatment for severe-to-profound hearing loss with no significant differences in auditory performances between older and younger CI recipients. Even if somewhat slower, subjects older than 65 reached good performance and therefore are good candidates for a cochlear implant.
