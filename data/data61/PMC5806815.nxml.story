This study aimed to explore the role and mechanism(s) of flunarizine hydrochloride in the intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) rats. The 32 adult male Sprague Dawley (SD) rats were randomly assigned into four groups: control group, sham group, ICH group, and FLU + ICH group. The effects of flunarizine hydrochloride were assessed on the basis of hematoma volume, bloodâ€“brain barrier (BBB) integrity, and brain water content in the ICH rat models. The role of flunarizine hydrochloride in cell recovery was assessed by behavioral scores, quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR), and western blot assay. Involvement of PI3K/AKT pathway in exerting the effect of flunarizine hydrochloride was also determined. Results showed that the hematoma volume, BBB integrity, and brain water content were significantly decreased in the FLU + ICH group. Cell apoptosis significantly increased in the ICH model group, while flunarizine hydrochloride decreased this increase. The expressions of glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF), neuroglobin (NGB), and p-AKT were increased after flunarizine hydrochloride treatment in ICH rats. In conclusion, flunarizine hydrochloride has protective effects against ICH by reducing brain injury, cell apoptosis, and the activation of P13K/AKT pathway. These findings provide a theoretical basis for the treatment of flunarizine hydrochloride in ICH.
