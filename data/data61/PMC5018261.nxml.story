Primary antibody deficiencies (PADs) are the most common immunodeficiency in humans, characterized by low levels of immunoglobulins and inadequate antibody responses upon immunization. These PADs may result from an early block in B cell development with a complete absence of peripheral B cells and lack of immunoglobulins. In the presence of circulating B cells, some PADs are genetically caused by a class switch recombination (CSR) defect, but in the most common PAD, common variable immunodeficiency (CVID), very few gene defects have as yet been characterized despite various phenotypic classifications. Using a functional read-out, we previously identified a functional subgroup of CVID patients with plasmablasts (PBs) producing IgM only. We have now further characterized such CVID patients by a direct functional comparison with patients having genetically well-characterized CSR defects in CD40L, activation-induced cytidine deaminase (AID) and uracil N-glycosylase activity (UNG). The CSR-like CVID patients showed a failure in B cell activation patterns similar to the classical AID/UNG defects in three out of five CVID patients and distinct more individual defects in the two other CVID cases when tested for cellular activation and PB differentiation. Thus, functional categorization of B cell activation and differentiation pathways extends the expected variation in CVID to CSR-like defects of as yet unknown genetic etiology.
