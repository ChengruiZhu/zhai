Downregulation of microRNA-129 (miR-129) has been described in various types of cancer, however, the significance of miR-129 in lung cancer has not been investigated. The present study, for the first time, determined miR-129-5p expression levels in both lung cancer cell lines and primary lung cancer tissues and also studied the effect of miR-129-5p on the proliferation and invasiveness of lung cancer cells. The results showed that miR-129-5p expression was significantly reduced in both lung cancer cell lines and primary lung cancer tissues (P<0.05). Further research revealed that miR-129-5p could suppress the proliferation and invasion capability of lung cancer cells. Bioinformatics analysis suggested three cancer-related miR-129-5p target genes: Microspherule protein 1 (MCRS1), E-cadherin and vimentin. Further investigation via reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction and western blot analysis showed that miR-129-5p was able to reduce the expression levels of MCRS1 and vimentin and enhance the expression of E-cadherin at both the messenger RNA and protein levels. The present results indicate that miR-129-5p is able to suppress lung cancer cell viability and invasion, which may occur via the modulating of MCRS1, E-cadherin and vimentin expression. These findings suggest that miR-129-5p may be a potential biomarker and/or treatment strategy for lung cancer.
