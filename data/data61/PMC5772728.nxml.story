Increasing evidence demonstrates that microRNAs (miRNAs/miRs), a type of non-coding small RNA, can regulate tumor cell migration, invasion and metastasis, and may therefore serve a major function in the occurrence and development of tumors. The present study investigated the effect of miR-383 on the proliferation, migration and invasion of colon cancer HT-29 and LoVo cell lines. The expression of miR-383 in colon cancer and adjacent non-tumor tissues was examined by reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction. MiR-383 upregulation was stimulated by transfection with a miR-383 mimic. Cell proliferation was measured with MTT and colony formation assays, and cell migration and invasion potential were examined by Transwell chamber assays. A proliferating-inducing ligand (APRIL), myeloid cell leukemia-1 and cyclooxygenase-2 protein expression was analyzed by western blotting. The expression of miR-383 was decreased in colon cancer tissues compared with adjacent non-tumor tissues (P<0.05). Transfection with a miR-383 mimic suppressed proliferation and inhibited cell migration and invasion in HT-29 and LoVo colon cancer cell lines. Overexpression of miR-383 in HT-29 and LoVo cells resulted in the suppression of APRIL protein expression. In conclusion, miR-383 was downregulated in colon cancer. The upregulation of miR-383 inhibited proliferation, migration and invasion of colon cancer cells, potentially through the regulation of target gene APRIL.
