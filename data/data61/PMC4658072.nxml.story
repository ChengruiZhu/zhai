RNA polymerases (RNAPs) are usually recognized to work as Brownian ratchet machines, with mechanical movements and chemical reactions loosely coupled during transcription elongation. Nevertheless, structural studies on the single-subunit T7 RNAP had suggested an alternative power stroke scenario, which requires the PPi product release reaction tightly couples with or drives the polymerase translocation. To resolve the conflicting views in the mechano-chemical coupling scenario, we conducted atomistic molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to investigate the PPi release mechanism of T7 RNAP. Using a large number of nanosecond short simulations, we constructed the Markov state model (MSM) and found that the PPi release undergoes a jump-from-cavity activation process, unlikely to further support the translocation. The MSM implementations to multi-subunit RNAPs previously demonstrated instead the charge facilitated hopping mechanisms of the PPi release. To further explore essential slow motions during the PPi release, we also performed microsecond long MD simulations. The PPi release does not appear to be tightly coupled to the rotational opening of an O-helix that is directly tied to the polymerase translocation. Hence, the study again disfavors the power stroke scenario. Remarkably, we discovered a key residue Lys472 that is able to assist PPi to jump out of the cavity. The mechanism can be general to a group of polymerases sharing conserved structural features with T7 RNAP, while the lysine or arginine module to assist the PPi release can be universal to both the single and multi-subunit RNAPs, even though the overall structural features and the PPi release mechanisms are significantly different.
