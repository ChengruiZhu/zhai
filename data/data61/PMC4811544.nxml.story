In 10,610 individuals referred to a single French hospital because of suspected or established kidney disease or before kidney donation, the researchers compared GFR measured by inulin clearance with GFR estimated using the CKD-EPI and Schwartz equations. They evaluated the reliability of each equation by calculating the average (mean) ratio of estimated GFR to measured GFR (a ratio of 1 indicates that the equation yielded GFR values identical to those from the gold-standard inulin clearance test) and by assessing the precision and accuracy of the estimated GFR values: the precision of a measurement indicates its reproducibility and reliability; the accuracy of a measurement indicates its closeness to the true value of a quantity. Across all the participants, the mean ratio of estimated GFR to measured GFR with the Schwartz equation was nearer to 1 than the mean ratio for the CKD-EPI equation. Among participants of all ages with measured GFR values indicating mild loss of kidney function, the mean ratio obtained with Schwartz equation was also nearer to 1 than that obtained with the CKD-EPI equation. Among young adults (18–40 years old) with measured GFR values indicating mild to moderate loss of kidney function, the Schwartz equation had better precision and was more accurate than the CKD-EPI equation, but, in all patients aged ≥65 years, the CKD-EPI equation performed better than the Schwartz equation. Finally, in children and adolescents, the Schwartz equation performed better than the CKD-EPI equation.
