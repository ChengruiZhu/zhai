Endometriosis-associated ovarian cancers demonstrate substantial morphological and genetic diversity. The transcription factor, hepatocyte nuclear factor (HNF)-1β, may be one of several key genes involved in the identity of ovarian clear cell carcinoma (CCC). The present study reviews a considerably expanded set of HNF-1β-associated genes and proteins that determine the pathophysiology of CCC. The current literature was reviewed by searching MEDLINE/PubMed. Functional interpretations of gene expression profiling in CCC are provided. Several important CCC-related genes overlap with those known to be regulated by the upregulation of HNF-1β expression, along with a lack of estrogen receptor (ER) expression. Furthermore, the genetic expression pattern in CCC resembles that of the Arias-Stella reaction, decidualization and placentation. HNF-1β regulates a subset of progesterone target genes. HNF-1β may also act as a modulator of female reproduction, playing a role in endometrial regeneration, differentiation, decidualization, glycogen synthesis, detoxification, cell cycle regulation, implantation, uterine receptivity and a successful pregnancy. In conclusion, the present study focused on reviewing the aberrant expression of CCC-specific genes and provided an update on the pathological implications and molecular functions of well-characterized CCC-specific genes.
