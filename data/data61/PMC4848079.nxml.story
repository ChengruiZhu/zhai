Merging multimodal information about myocardial scar tissue can help electrophysiologists to find the most appropriate target during catheter ablation of ventricular arrhythmias. A framework is presented to analyze and combine information from delayed enhancement magnetic resonance imaging (DE-MRI) and electro-anatomical mapping data. Using this information, electrical, mechanical, and image-based characterization of the myocardium are performed. The presented framework allows the left ventricle to be segmented by DE-MRI and the scar to be characterized prior to the intervention based on image information. It allows the electro-anatomical maps obtained during the intervention from a navigation system to be merged together with the anatomy and scar information extracted from DE-MRI. It also allows for the estimation of endocardial motion and deformation to assess cardiac mechanics. Therefore, electrical, mechanical, and image-based characterization of the myocardium can be performed. The feasibility of this approach was demonstrated on three patients with ventricular tachycardia associated to ischemic cardiomyopathy by integrating images from DE-MRI and electro-anatomical maps data in a common framework for intraoperative myocardial tissue characterization. The proposed framework has the potential to guide and monitor delivery of radio frequency ablation of ventricular tachycardia. It is also helpful for research purposes, facilitating the study of the relationship between electrical and mechanical properties of the tissue, as well as with tissue viability from DE-MRI.
