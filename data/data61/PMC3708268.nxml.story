Lung Cancer is known as one of the most difficult cancer to cure, and the number of deaths that it causes generally increasing. A detection of the Lung Cancer in its early stage can be helpful for Medical treatment to limit the danger, but it is a challenging problem due to Cancer cell structure. Interpretation of Medical image is often difficult and time consuming, even for the experienced Physicians. The aid of image analysis Based on machine learning can make this process easier. This paper describes fully Automatic Decision Support system for Lung Cancer diagnostic from CT Lung images. Most traditional medical diagnosis systems are founded on huge quantity of training data and takes long processing time. However, on the occasion that very little volume of data is available, the traditional diagnosis systems derive defects such as larger error, Time complexity. Focused on the solution to this problem, a Medical Diagnosis System based on Hidden Markov Model (HMM) is presented. In this paper we describe a pre-processing stage involving some Noise removal techniques help to solve this problem, we preprocess an images (by Mean Error Square Filtering and Histogram analysis)obtained after scanning the Lung CT images. Secondly separate the lung areas from an image by a segmentation process (by Thresholding and region growing techniques). Finally we developed HMM for the classification of Cancer Nodule. Results are checked for 2D and 4D CT images. This automation process reduces the time complexity and increases the diagnosis confidence.
