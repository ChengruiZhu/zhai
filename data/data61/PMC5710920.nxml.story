The DNA demethylation pathway has been discovered to play a significant role in DNA epigenetics. This pathway removes the methyl group from cytosine, which is involved in the oxidation of 5-methylcytosine to 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5-hmC) by ten-eleven translocation (TET) proteins. Then, 5-hmC can be iteratively oxidized to generate 5-formylcytosine (5-foC) and 5-carboxylcytosine (5-caC). However, 5-hmC, 5-foC, and 5-caC are hardly detected due to their low content. In this study, we have developed a LC-HRMS method coupled with derivatization to accurately and simultaneously quantify 5-mC levels, along with its oxidation products in genomic DNA. Derivatization was carried out using 4-dimethylamino benzoic anhydride, which has been shown to improve separation and enhance the detection sensitivity. Finally, we successfully applied this method towards the quantification of 5-mC, 5-hmC, 5-foC, and 5-caC in genomic DNA isolated from both human breast cancer tissue and tumor-adjacent normal tissue. We show that 5-foC and 5-caC are increased in tumor tissue. In addition, the levels of 5-mC, 5-hmC, 5-foC, and 5-caC measured in tumor tissue versus tumor-adjacent tissue were found to be distinct among different classifications. This suggests that cytosine modifiers could be used as potential biomarkers for determining the stage of development of breast cancer, as well as prognosis.
