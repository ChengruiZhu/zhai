Objective: The aim of this study is to report the prevalence and risk factors of recurrent aphthous ulceration (RAU) in patients attending Piramird dental speciality for seeking dental treatment.
Study design: A cross-sectional survey was carried out among patients (n=1100) who were visiting the department of oral medicine at Piramird dental speciality center in Sulaimani from December 2011-February 2012.

All individuals had to answer specific questions including personal data (age, sex), level of education, occupation and smoking habit; etc. Additional questions were related to the risk factors that might be related to the condition. Chi Square test was used to analyze the data.
Result: The life time prevalence of RAU experience was 28.2% (n=282). It was highly significantly more common among females (31.76%) (p<0.004). The most commonly affected age group was 20-29 years (36.28%). The highest prevalence of RAU experience was seen among mere students (36.8%); Among non smokers there were highly significantly more patients with RAU experience (30%) than in heavy smoker patients (12.22%), (p=0.000). 34.4% of patients had family history of RAU. Lips and buccal mucosae were the commonest sites of ulcerations (73.10%), and the major risk factor was stress (43.3%).
