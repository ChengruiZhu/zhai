Secreted protein acidic and rich in cysteine-like 1 (SPARCL1), a member of extracelluar matrix glycoprotein, has been reported to be associated with various tumor types. The present study aimed to evaluate the prognostic value of SPARCL1 in patients with colorectal cancer. Tissue microarray blocks were constructed based on 79 patients who underwent radical surgery at the Kunshan First People's Hospital between 2008 and 2010. Thirty pairs of fresh-frozen tissues were also obtained for total protein extraction. The expression of SPARCL1 protein was analyzed using immunohistochemistry and western blotting analyses, and the association between overexpressed SPARCL1 and clinicopathological factors was evaluated. Survival analysis with Kaplan Meier curves and Cox regression analysis was used to analyze the prognostic value of SPARCL1. According to western blot analyses, SPARCL1 protein expression in colorectal tumors was significantly lower compared with corresponding normal tissues. The expression of SPARCL1 was markedly decreased from differentiation I to III, and the negative rate of SPARCL1 was higher at Duke's stage C compared with B. Though without any difference between ‘positive’ and ‘negative’ in overall survival, significantly higher survival in patients with positive SPARCL1 expression at Duke's stage B was detected in the present study. These results indicated that SPARCL1 may be a potential tumor suppressor gene and associated with good prognosis.
