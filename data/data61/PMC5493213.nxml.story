Cancer is a major health problem in India, with an estimated incidence of 1 million cases in 2012 that is likely to double in 2035 to approximately 1.7 million. The majority of cases are diagnosed in advanced stages, and approximately two thirds of patients die as a result of their disease. The mortality-to-incidence ratio is 0.68 in India, which is far higher than that in developed countries (approximately 0.38). One of the important reasons for this discrepancy is inequitable distribution and inaccessibility of health care resources in India. One component of scarce health care resources is the low ratio of oncologists to patients with cancer (1:2,000), which leads to delivery of systemic anticancer therapy in many hospitals by health care professionals who do not have required training. Given these facts, there is a need to focus on organization of medical oncology services in terms of manpower and infrastructure to standardize the delivery of systemic anticancer therapy. Redistribution of resources can streamline the delivery of cancer care, preferably close to the patientâ€™s home. This article describes the blueprint for organization of medical oncology services and delivery of chemotherapy and other systemic therapies to Indian patients. The model uses existing health care services in the country and is a four-tiered system of increasing sophistication: District Hospitals, Medical College Hospitals, Regional Cancer Centres, and Apex Cancer Centres. Delivery of quality care to patients with cancer through standardized protocols is crucial in improving cancer outcomes in India.
