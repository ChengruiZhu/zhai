There is ongoing scientific interest regarding comorbidities associated with the metabolic syndrome (MeTS). MeTS comprises a combination of parameters that predispose individuals to the development of type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease (CVD). Three or more of the following criteria are necessary: fasting glucose > 110 mg/dl (5.6 mmol/l), hypertriglyceridemia > 150 mg/dl (1.7 mmol/l), HDL levels < 40 mg/dl (men)/< 50 mg/dl (women), blood pressure > 130/85 mmHg, waist circumference (values for Mediterranean populations > 94 cm (men)/> 89 cm (women). In this review we attempted to summarize relevant data by searching dermatological literature regarding associations between various skin conditions and MeTS. A multitude of studies was retrieved and a further goal of the present article is to present plausible mechanistic connections. The severity of skin conditions like psoriasis has been linked with MeTS. Parameters of MeTS like insulin resistance are present in patients with early onset androgenic alopecia, hidradenitis suppurativa acne and rosacea. Since MeTS can lead to CVD and type 2 diabetes early detection of patients would be very important. Also therapeutic intervention on MeTS could lead to improvement on the severity of skin conditions. This reciprocal relationship between skin diseases and MeTS in our opinion holds great interest for further investigation.
