Ninety-nine patients were included, mean age: 47 years (r: 22–79); 70% men, 40.4% previous AIDS event and 39.3% HCV. Ninety-one patients had received ≥3 cART regimens and 45≥5, 75 patients had HIV-VL <50 cop/mL and 24 low-level viremia (LLV): 297.5±261.4 cop/mL, CD4+ 568±279 cells/µL. ART before switching: NRTI+PI/r (33%), NNRTI (17%), PI/r+NNRTI (23%), PI/r+INI (13%), other (14%). Main reason to switching was: toxicity/intolerance 50 patients (renal 32%, gastrointestinal: 14%, hyperlipidaemia 10%; osteopenia/osteoporosis: 6%); improving adherence 26 patients; prevention of complications 19 patients. Nine subjects withdrew ART during follow-up because: intolerance or new toxicity three; non-adherence two; simplification to DRV/r monotherapy two; persistence of previous toxicity one; virologic failure one. At week 24, among patients who continued with DRV/r+ETR (n=90): 81 (89%) had VL<50 cop/mL, in those with with HIV-VL<50 at baseline (67/90), 94% persisted with <50 cop., and in those with LLV (24/90), 61% (n=14) achieved a VL<50 cop. We didn't observe any significant difference in lab parameters between baseline and week 24. Estimated glomerular filtrate rate increased from 83.4±24.7 to 88.5±56.8 mL/min, p=NS. Regarding reason to switching, it improved in 42 cases, no changes: 20 cases; worsened: 4 cases, and non-applicable or unknown: 24 cases.
