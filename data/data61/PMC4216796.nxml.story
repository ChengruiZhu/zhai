Epidermal growth factor receptors 2 (Her-2) and 4 (Her-4) are closely associated with ovarian cancer (OC) progression and metastasis, and a more complete understanding of these signaling pathways allow the development of new therapeutic strategies. Melatonin (Mel) is recognized as having several anticancer properties and has been reported to modulate Her-2 system in aggressive tumors. Here, we investigated OC and the role of Mel therapy on the Her-2- and Her-4-signaling pathway related to downstream molecules in an ethanol-preferring rat model. To induce OC, the left ovary was injected directly with a single dose of 100 µg 7,12-dimethylbenz(a)anthracene (DMBA) dissolved in 10 µL of sesame oil under the bursa. Right ovaries were used as sham-surgery controls. After developing OC, half of the animals received i.p. injections of Mel (200 µg/100 g b.w./day) for 60 days. While Mel therapy was unable to reduce Her-4 and phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) levels, it was able to suppress the OC-related increase in the levels of the Her-2, p38 mitogen-activated protein kinases (p38 MAPK), protein kinase B (phospho-AKT), and mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR). In addition, Mel significantly attenuated the expression of Her-2, p38 MAPK, and p-AKT, which are involved in OC signaling during ethanol intake. Collectively, our results suggest that Mel attenuates the Her-2-signaling pathway in OC of ethanol-preferring rats, providing an effective contribution for further development of adjuvant therapies.
