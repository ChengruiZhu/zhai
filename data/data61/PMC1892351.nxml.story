Understanding the conditions that favor the constancy of phenotypes in the face of deleterious mutation pressure—mutational robustness—is an outstanding question in evolutionary biology. Theoretical and in silico studies utilizing digital organisms predict that slow-replicating populations can outcompete those with higher individual fitness if the former show greater robustness. This “survival of the flattest” hypothesis sits in contrast to most models of natural selection based on individual fitness, and hence challenges the “survival of the fittest” paradigm. In this work, the authors use experimental populations of the rapidly evolving vesicular stomatitis RNA virus to provide the first evidence of natural selection for mutational robustness. Based on the analysis of fitness distributions, genetic variability, and the ability to tolerate mutation accumulation, two populations with different levels of robustness were characterized. At artificially enhanced mutation rates following the application of mutagens, the more robust viral population outcompeted the other population despite having a lower replication rate. This study has important implications for lethal mutagenesis—an antiviral strategy that consists of increasing viral mutation rates through the use of mutagenic drugs—since selectively favored mutational robustness may allow RNA viruses to evolve resistance to this form of treatment.
