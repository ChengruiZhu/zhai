The action of charybdotoxin (ChTX), a peptide component isolated from the venom of the scorpion Leiurus quinquestriatus, was investigated on membrane currents of identified neurons from the marine mollusk, Aplysia californica. Macroscopic current recordings showed that the external application of ChTX blocks the Ca-activated K current in a dose- and voltage-dependent manner. The apparent dissociation constant is 30 nM at V = -30 mV and increases e-fold for a +50- to +70-mV change in membrane potential, which indicates that the toxin molecule is sensitive to approximately 35% of the transmembrane electric field. The toxin is bound to the receptor with a 1:1 stoichiometry and its effect is reversible after washout. The toxin also suppresses the membrane leakage conductance and a resting K conductance activated by internal Ca ions. The toxin has no significant effect on the inward Na or Ca currents, the transient K current, or the delayed rectifier K current. Records from Ca-activated K channels revealed a single channel conductance of 35 +/- 5 pS at V = 0 mV in asymmetrical K solution. The channel open probability increased with the internal Ca concentration and with membrane voltage. The K channels were blocked by submillimolar concentrations of tetraethylammonium ions and by nanomolar concentrations of ChTX, but were not blocked by 4-aminopyridine if applied externally on outside-out patches. From the effects of ChTX on K current and on bursting pacemaker activity, it is concluded that the termination of bursts is in part controlled by a Ca-activated K conductance.
