Phage
display-mediated immuno-polymerase chain reaction (PD-IPCR)
is an ultrasensitive detection technology that combines the advantages
of immuno-PCR and phage display. The phage particle, which displayed
antibody fragments including single-chain fragment variable (scFv),
variable domain of heavy-chain antibodies (VHH), and antigen-binding
fragment (Fab) on the surface can be directly used in IPCR, supplying
both the detection antibody and deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) template.
In this work, we used ochratoxin A (OTA) as a model system to study
the capacity of PD-IPCR in the detection of toxic small molecular
weight compounds, especially mycotoxins. An alpaca-derived VHH library
was constructed and subjected to four cycles of panning. In total,
16 clones with four unique sequences were selected by competitive
binding with OTA. The clone VHH-28 resulted in the lowest 50% inhibitory
concentration of 0.31 ng/mL in the phage enzyme-linked immunosorbent
assay (ELISA) and was selected to develop the VHH phage-based real-time
immuno-PCR (RT-IPCR). The detection limit of the VHH phage-based RT-IPCR
was 3.7 pg/L, with a linear range of 0.01â€“1000 pg/mL. This
method was compared with conventional ELISA, and validation results
indicated the reliability of VHH phage-based RT-IPCR in the detection
of OTA in cereal samples. This study provides a new idea for the ultrasensitive
detection of mycotoxins and other toxic small molecular weight compounds.
