We analyzed a large patient and volunteer study of external respiratory motion in order to develop a population database of respiratory information. We analyzed 120 lung, liver, and abdominal patients and 25 volunteers without lung disease to determine the extent of motion using the Varian Real‐Time Position Management system. The volunteer respiratory motion was measured for both abdominal and thoracic placement of the RPM box. Evaluation of a subset of 55 patients demonstrates inter‐ and intrafraction variation over treatment. We also calculated baseline drift and duty cycle for patients and volunteers. The mean peak‐to‐peak amplitude (SD) for the patients was 1.0 (0.5) cm, and for the volunteers it was abdomen 0.8 (0.3) cm and thoracic 0.2 (0.2) cm. The mean period (SD) was 3.6 (1.0) s, 4.2 (1.1) s, and 4.1 (0.8) s, and the mean end exhale position (SD) was 60% (6), 58% (7), and 56% (7) for patient, volunteer abdomen, and volunteer thoracic, respectively. Baseline drift was greater than 0.5 cm for 40% of patients. We found statistically significant differences between the patient and volunteer groups. Peak‐to‐peak amplitude was significantly larger for patients than the volunteer abdominal measurement and the volunteer abdominal measurement is significantly larger than the volunteer thoracic measurement. The patient group also exhibited significantly larger baseline drift than the volunteer group. We also found that peak‐to‐peak amplitude was the most variable parameter for both intra‐ and interfraction motion. This database compilation can be used as a resource for expected motion when using external surrogates in radiotherapy applications.
