Dysregulation of lipid metabolism in skeletal muscle is involved in the development of insulin resistance. Mutations in lipin-1, a key lipid metabolism regulator leads to significant systemic insulin resistance in fld mice. However, the function of lipin-1 on lipid metabolism and insulin sensitivity in skeletal muscle is still unclear. Herein we demonstrated that downregulation of lipin-1 in C2C12 myotubes by siRNA transfection suppressed insulin action, characterized by reduced insulin stimulated Akt phosphorylation and glucose uptake. Correspondingly, decreased lipin-1 expression was observed in palmitate-induced insulin resistance in C2C12 myotubes, suggested that lipin-1 might play a role in the etiology of insulin resistance in skeletal muscle. The insulin resistance induced by lipin-1 downregulation was related to the disturbance of lipid homeostasis. Lipin-1 silencing reduced intracellular DAG and TAG levels, but elevated ceramide accumulation in C2C12 myotubes. Moreover, the impaired insulin stimulated Akt phosphorylation and glucose uptake caused by lipin-1 silencing could be blocked by the pretreatment with SPT inhibitor myriocin, ceramide synthase inhibitor FB1, or PP2A inhibitor okadaic acid, suggested that the increased ceramide accumulation might be responsible for the development of insulin resistance induced by lipin-1 silencing in C2C12 myotubes. Meanwhile, decreased lipin-1 expression also impaired mitochondrial function in C2C12 myotubes. Therefore, our study suggests that lipin-1 plays an important role in lipid metabolism and downregulation of lipin-1 induces insulin resistance by increasing intracellular ceramide accumulation in C2C12 myotubes. These results offer a molecular insight into the role of lipin-1 in the development of insulin resistance in skeletal muscle.
