Indirect computed tomography lymphography (CT-LG) could be used to determine the regional spread of cancer and assess lymphatic function by the interstitial delivery of diagnostic agents. Few studies have been reported on its use in pyriform sinus carcinoma. The aim of the present study was to establish the rabbit VX2 tumor as a model for pyriform sinus carcinoma and to observe its neck lymph node metastasis by indirect CT-LG. VX2 tumor tissue suspension was transplanted into the pyriform sinus submucosa of 15 rabbits under direct laryngoscope. Rabbits were randomly placed into one of three groups, each comprised of five rabbits. Observation of the tumor growth and neck lymph node metastases were taken on days 14 (group 1), 21 (group 2) and 28 (group 3) following transplantation using the method of indirect CT-LG. VX2 tumors were transplanted successfully in all rabbits. Deep cervical lymph nodes were enhanced clearly in indirect CT-LG. The contrast agent filling defected appeared on the metastasis nodes while the lymph node without metastasis was smooth. The metastasis rates of deep cervical lymph nodes were 100% in all three groups on CT-LG. The CT attenuation value of CT-LG reached peak values of 400 and 600 Hu at 1 and 3 min after the injection, which then decreased gradually. In this study, CT-LG could demonstrate the internal architecture of lymph nodes and their lymphatic vessels, and therefore may have the advantages of radiological methods such as B ultrasound, CT, magnetic resonance imaging and positron emission tomography.
