Image‐guided techniques for radiation therapy have improved the precision of radiation delivery by sparing normal tissues. Cone‐beam computed tomography (CBCT) has emerged as a key technique for patient positioning and target localization in radiotherapy. Here, we investigated the imaging radiation dose delivered to radiosensitive organs of a patient during CBCT scan. The 4D extended cardiac‐torso (XCAT) phantom and Geant4 Application for Tomographic Emission (GATE) Monte Carlo (MC) simulation tool were used for the study. A computed tomography dose index (CTDI) standard polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) phantom was used to validate the MC‐based dosimetric evaluation. We implemented an MC model of a clinical on‐board imager integrated with the Trilogy accelerator. The MC model's accuracy was validated by comparing its weighted CTDI (CTDIw) values with those of previous studies, which revealed good agreement. We calculated the absorbed doses of various human organs at different treatment sites such as the head‐and‐neck, chest, abdomen, and pelvis regions, in both standard CBCT scan mode (125 kVp, 80 mA, and 25 ms) and low‐dose scan mode (125 kVp, 40 mA, and 10 ms). In the former mode, the average absorbed doses of the organs in the head and neck and chest regions ranged 4.09‐8.28 cGy, whereas those of the organs in the abdomen and pelvis regions were 4.30‐7.48 cGy. In the latter mode, the absorbed doses of the organs in the head and neck and chest regions ranged 1.61‐1.89 cGy, whereas those of the organs in the abdomen and pelvis region ranged between 0.79‐1.85 cGy. The reduction in the radiation dose in the low‐dose mode compared to the standard mode was about 20%, which is in good agreement with previous reports. We opine that the findings of this study would significantly facilitate decisions regarding the administration of extra imaging doses to radiosensitive organs.
