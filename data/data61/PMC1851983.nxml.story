Circadian rhythms, characterized by a period close to 24 h, are observed in nearly all living organisms, from cyanobacteria to plants, insects, and mammals. In mammals, the central circadian clock is located in the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) of the hypothalamus, where it receives light signals from the retina. In turn, the SCN controls circadian rhythms in peripheral tissues and behavioral activity. The SCN is composed of about 20,000 neurons characterized by a small size and a high density. Within each individual neuron, clock genes and proteins compose interlocked regulatory feedback loops that generate circadian oscillations on the molecular level. SCN neurons dispersed in cell cultures display cell-autonomous oscillations, with periods ranging from 20 h to 28 h. The ventrolateral part of the SCN receives light input from the retina, serving as a relay for the dorsomedial part. Coupling and synchronization among SCN neurons are ensured by neurotransmitters. A desire to understand how such a network of heterogeneous circadian oscillators achieves a synchronous and coherent output rhythm has motivated extensive experimental and theoretical work. In this paper, we present a molecular model combining intracellular and extracellular dynamics for the SCN circadian system, and propose a novel synchronization mechanism. Our results predict a dual role for the coupling factors within the SCN, both in maintaining the rhythmicity and in promoting the synchronization between the circadian oscillators.
