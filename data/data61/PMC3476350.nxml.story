A 2-year-old female came to the Neurological Emergency Room of “Giovanni XXIII” Hospital in Bari, 6 h after the onset of severe facial pain, which occurred soon after awakening. Stabbing pain affected the right frontal and periorbital area, with ipsilateral conjunctival injection, swelling of the eyelids and tearing. Except the duration, from 5 to 30 s., the attacks were stereotyped including the occurrence and features of autonomic signs. Based on the typical clinical findings and the normal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), we diagnosed short-lasting unilateral neuralgiform headache attacks with conjunctival injection and tearing syndrome (SUNCT). The spontaneous remission within a few hours made prophylactic therapy unnecessary. At the last follow-up, after 3 months, the patient was still symptom free. In our case, after an active period lasting 2 days the disease disappeared completely. However the typical features of the disease (unilateral pain, short duration and high frequency of the attacks, autonomic signs ipsilateral to pain, numbers of attacks) were all present. While the diagnostic criteria of the International Headache Society classification for SUNCT did not include the duration of disease, it is likely that the active period lasting 2 days could be an expression of the clinical variability of the disease.
