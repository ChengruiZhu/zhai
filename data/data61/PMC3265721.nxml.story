A keyhole lymphet heamocyanin is an antigen which triggers Th1 type of immune response. A QTL for a primary immune response towards keyhole lymphet heamocyanin has been detected on chicken chromosome 14 in three populations. The results from the most recent population were inconsistent and varied depending on the applied QTL detection model. The major goal of the current study was the reanalysis of this data using a 2 QTL model. Additionally, in order to provide more accurate estimates of QTL effects and positions, epistasis between the QTL was considered as a potential important contributor to quantitative traits. Four statistical models were assumed: M1: A model assuming marginal additive effects of two QTL; M2: A model assuming marginal and epistatic additive effects of two QTL; M3: A model assuming marginal additive and dominance effects of two QTL; M4: A model assuming marginal additive and dominance effects of two QTL and all possible pairwise epistases. Two QTL with significant additive and dominance effects were detected on chicken chromosome 14 using model M3. One QTL was detected at 63 cM between MCW0123 and ROS0005, another at 76 cM between ROS0005 and MCW0225/NTN2Lsts1 (FDR = 0.0051). Modelling only additive effects resulted in a significantly worse fit. On the other hand, including epistatic effects did not improve fit significantly. The current study confirms previous reports of the QTL location on GGA14. A notable finding of this study is recognition of two closely related QTL for a keyhole lymphet heamocyanin response at the distal part of chicken chromosome 14.
