The value of interventional ultrasound in the diagnosis and treatment of submucous myoma of the uterus was assessed to study the ultrasonographic features of modified sonohysterography for submucous polyp of uterus. A total of 25 patients diagnosed preliminarily as submucous myoma of the uterus via conventional ultrasound examination from June 2014 to December 2016 were enrolled in the study. The diagnosis was made via the comprehensive analysis of ultrasound-guided modified SHG, followed by ultrasound-guided needle biopsy and sclerotherapy of tumor. After modified SHG and ultrasound-guided needle biopsy, 96% (24/25) cases were confirmed pathologically as submucous myoma of the uterus. After treatment, the maximum diameter of myoma in patients with submucous myoma of uterus was significantly different, and the volume of myoma was significantly reduced. After treatment, the clinical symptoms of patients with submucous myoma of the uterus were obviously improved compared to before treatment (P<0.05). It was found in the follow-up after treatment that a small number of patients suffered from mild abdominal pain, increased secretion, slight vaginal bleeding, cold sweat, pale complexion, dizziness and other symptoms, which, however, disappeared after treatment for about 1 week. The score of 36 item Short-Form Health Survey Questionnaire of patients with submucous myoma of the uterus was significantly different before and after treatment (P<0.05). Interventional ultrasonography can effectively diagnose the submucous myoma of uterus. The treatment of submucous myoma of uterus with ultrasound-guided intratumor injection of lauromacrogol is characterized by simple operation, which can effectively reduce the tumor diameter and volume, improve the blood flow in patients, reduce the postoperative adverse reactions and alleviate the patient's pain, so it is a new type of minimally invasive treatment method of submucous myoma of the uterus, and it is worthy of clinical promotion and application.
