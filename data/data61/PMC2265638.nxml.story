Mutations are raw materials of evolution. Earlier studies have shown that mutations occur at different frequencies in different genomic regions. By investigating the patterns and causes of such “regional” variation of mutations, we can better understand the mechanisms of underlying mutagenesis. In the human and other mammalian genomes, the most common type of mutation is caused by DNA methylation, which targets cytosines followed by guanine (CpG dinucleotides). Methylated cytosines are then subject to spontaneous deamination, which will cause a C to T (or G to A) transition (CpG substitution). Because this mutational process is unique to CpG substitutions, we reasoned that they might show different patterns of variability from other substitutions. Using high quality genomic sequences from primates and by separately analyzing variability of CpG substitutions and other substitutions, we demonstrate that CpG substitutions occur approximately 15 times more frequently than other substitutions, and show a distinctive pattern of regional variability. Particularly, we propose and provide evidence that because the deamination step requires temporary strand separation, G+C composition near 1,500–2,000 bps each direction from a target CpG affects the probability of a CpG substitution. Incorporating the difference in CpG and other substitutions discovered in this study will help build more realistic evolutionary models.
