, we utilized a genetically engineered mouse model, referred to as TRAMP mice, that is predisposed to develop prostate tumors. In this model, we demonstrate that prostate tumors from 30-week-old TRAMP mice have increased Ron expression compared to age-matched wild-type prostates. Based on the upregulation of Ron in human prostate cancers and in this murine model of prostate tumorigenesis, we hypothesized that this receptor plays a functional role in the development of prostate tumors. To test this hypothesis, we crossed TRAMP mice with mice that are deficient in Ron signaling (TK−/−). Interestingly, TK−/− TRAMP+ mice show a significant decrease in prostate tumor mass relative to TRAMP mice containing functional Ron. Moreover, TK−/− TRAMP+ prostate tumors exhibited decreased tumor vascularization relative to TK+/+ TRAMP+ prostate tumors, which correlated with reduced levels of the angiogenic molecules VEGF and CXCL2. While Ron loss did not alter tumor cell proliferation, a significant decrease in cell survival was observed. Similarly, murine prostate cancer cell lines containing a Ron deficiency exhibited decreased levels of active NF-kappaB suggesting that Ron may be important in regulating prostate cell survival at least partly through this pathway. In total, our data show for the first time that Ron promotes prostate tumor growth, prostate tumor angiogenesis, and prostate cancer cell survival
