Advances in surgical techniques and laparoscopic instruments have resulted in the development of laparoscopic pancreatic surgery. Total pancreaticoduodenectomy is performed for treating benign and borderline pancreatic disease involving the whole pancreas. Here, we report a case of metastatic renal cell carcinoma in the pancreas, treated by laparoscopic pylorus-preserving total pancreaticoduodenectomy. A 59-year-old woman was diagnosed with metastatic renal cell carcinoma. Multiple metastatic lesions were found on routine follow-up. She had a history of radical video-assisted right-nephrectomy for renal cell carcinoma (conventional type, pT1) in November 2003, without any recurrence. However, in 2014, a routine health checkup revealed multiple enhancing lesions throughout the pancreas. Positron emission tomography showed a suspicious 4-cm lesion in her left thyroid. Laparoscopic pylorus-preserving total pancreaticoduodenectomy with splenectomy was performed, along with simultaneous left total thyroidectomy with central compartment node dissection for metastatic renal cell carcinomas. The total operation time was 441 min, with an estimated blood loss of 150 ml; no transfusion was administered. Her hospital stay was 12 days. The histopath report confirmed metastatic renal cell carcinoma in the pancreas and left thyroid. Based on literature reviews, we further tried to estimate the oncologic outcome of total pancreatectomy in multiple pancreatic metastasis of renal cell carcinoma. Laparoscopic pylorus-preserving total pancreaticoduodenectomy is feasible and safe, even in cases of metastatic renal cell carcinoma.
