This study establishes that dendritic cells (DC) are the critical accessory cells for the development of anti-trinitrophenol (TNP) cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL) in vitro. We developed a model in which nylon wool-nonadherent spleen cells were used both as the responding and stimulating cells, the latter having been TNP-modified and x- irradiated. Thy-1-bearing CTL developed in C57BL/6, B6D2F1, and CBA mice only when small numbers of DC were added. Maximal responses in 5-d cultures were achieved with 0.5-1 DC/100 responding T cells. The DC did not have to be TNP modified directly. Anti-Ia and complement inactivated accessory cells, whereas similar treatment of the responders had no effect. DC exposed to ultraviolet radiation were ineffective, but x-irradiated DC were fully active. Culture media from DC, or from DC-nylon wool-passed spleen T cell cocultures that contained abundant CTL, would not substitute for viable DC. Enriched preparations of macrophages (M phi) were obtained from blood, peritoneal cavity, and spleens of BCG-immune and unprimed mice. M phi added at doses of 0.2-4% were weak or inactive as accessory cells. The level of Ia antigens on test M phi populations was quantitated and visualized by binding of a radioiodinated monoclonal anti-I-Ab,d antibody, clone B-21. M phi that bore substantial amounts of Ia from all organs were weak accessory cells. Addition of M phi to DC-T cell cocultures produced inhibitory effects, usually at a dose of 2% M phi. In contrast, 0.5% Ia-bearing M phi from BCG-immune boosted mice inhibited > 80% of the DC-mediated CTL response. Addition of indomethacin reversed M phi inhibition, and 10(-9) M prostaglandin E2 in turn blocked the indomethacin effect. Indomethacin also restored a low level of accessory cell function in immune-boosted adherent peritoneal cells, but not in preparations of monocytes and spleen M phi. Small numbers of DC were identified in preparations of immune- boosted peritoneal cells and may have accounted for the observed accessory activity. We conclude that the development of anti-TNP CTL is an immune response in which (a) DC are the critical accessory cells; (b) Ia-bearing M phi are weak or inactive; and (c) M phi can inhibit DC- mediated response by an indomethacin-sensitive mechanism.
