Transposable elements comprise a substantial portion of many eukaryotic genomes. These mobile fragments of DNA can directly mutate genes through insertions into coding regions but may also affect the gene regulation through nearby insertions. There is evidence that the majority of transposable elements are epigenetically silenced, and in some cases this silencing may spread to neighboring sequences. This spreading of heterochromatin could create a significant fitness tradeoff between transposon silencing and gene expression. The maize genome has a complex organization with many genes flanked by retrotransposons, providing an opportunity to study the interaction of retrotransposons and genes. To survey the prevalence of heterochromatin spreading associated with different retrotransposon families, we profiled the spread of heterochromatin into nearby low copy sequences for 150 high copy retrotransposon families. While many retrotransposons exhibit little to no spreading of heterochromatin, there are some retrotransposon families that do exhibit spreading. Genes located near retrotransposons that spread heterochromatin have lower expression levels. The families of retrotransposons that spread heterochromatin marks to nearby low-copy sequences may have increased fitness costs for the host genome due to their suppression of genes located near insertions.
