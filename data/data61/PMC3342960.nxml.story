One major implication from genetic work done several decades ago is that the genome contains a lot of sequences that do not constitute genes or other functional elements. The total amount of DNA—the genome size—is thus not necessarily an indicator of DNA complexity or organismal complexity, an observation often referred to as the C-value paradox (C-value being a measure of DNA content). What then is it that determines genome size? One model posits that the evolution of genome size is not a consequence of natural selection but is instead governed by the incidence and character of naturally occurring mutations that affect the length of DNA, a process that is not affected by selection. Here we present the results of an analysis of how recombination affects the size of avian and human genomes. We find strong evidence that the rate of recombination is a driving force of genome size evolution. In regions of the genome where recombination occurs frequently, the loss of DNA caused by small deletions is particularly pronounced. Our simulations show that the effect of such recombination-driven genome contraction can be profound over evolutionary time scales. These observations lead to a model in which recombination is mutagenic for length changes and that the incidence of deletions increases with increasing recombination rate. Although we cannot formally exclude that natural selection contributes to the observed relationship between recombination and genome contraction, we find no evidence to support such a scenario.
