Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is characterized by the selective degeneration of motor neurons (MNs) and their target muscles. Misfolded proteins which often form intracellular aggregates are a pathological hallmark of ALS. Disruption of the functional interplay between protein degradation (ubiquitin proteasome system and autophagy) and RNA-binding protein homeostasis has recently been suggested as an integrated model that merges several ALS-associated proteins into a common pathophysiological pathway. The E102Q mutation in one such candidate gene, the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) chaperone Sigma receptor-1 (SigR1), has been reported to cause juvenile ALS. Although loss of SigR1 protein contributes to neurodegeneration in several ways, the molecular mechanisms underlying E102Q-SigR1-mediated neurodegeneration are still unclear. In the present study, we showed that the E102Q-SigR1 protein rapidly aggregates and accumulates in the ER and associated compartments in transfected cells, leading to structural alterations of the ER, nuclear envelope and mitochondria and to subsequent defects in proteasomal degradation and calcium homeostasis. ER defects and proteotoxic stress generated by E102Q-SigR1 aggregates further induce autophagy impairment, accumulation of stress granules and cytoplasmic aggregation of the ALS-linked RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) matrin-3, FUS, and TDP-43. Similar ultrastructural abnormalities as well as altered protein degradation and misregulated RBP homeostasis were observed in primary lymphoblastoid cells (PLCs) derived from E102Q-SigR1 fALS patients. Consistent with these findings, lumbar
