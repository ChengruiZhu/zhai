Galanin (GAL) is a 30-amino acid neuropeptide that is expressed in both the central and peripheral nervous system, including the enteric nervous system (ENS). Increased GAL concentrations have been identified in the blood of colorectal cancer (CRC) patients. The aim of the present study was to assess whether sections of the colon wall containing ENS plexuses or CRC tumor are associated with increased GAL concentrations. Blood samples were collected from 68 CRC patients and 39 healthy volunteers. In addition, samples of CRC tumors and colon wall tissue in close proximity to and distant from the neoplastic tissue were obtained from 22 CRC patients. The GAL concentration of sera and tissue homogenates obtained from three sections of the colon wall (mucosa with submucosa, muscularis externa and CRC tumor) was analyzed by ELISA. The localization of GAL was evaluated using immunohistochemistry and morphometry was used to measure the distribution of GAL-immunoreactive (GAL-Ir) myenteric plexuses in the vicinity of cancer invasion and in sections of the colon wall distant from the tumor. The GAL serum concentration of CRC patients was 2.4 times higher than that of the control group. The GAL concentration was highest in the homogenates of neoplastic tissue and mucosa obtained from the control (distant) section of the intestinal wall, followed by that in the mucosa and muscularis externa proximal to the tumor. The lowest GAL concentrations were identified within the muscular layer of the colon wall located distant from the tumor. Strong GAL immunoreactivity was identified in the cancer cells, intestinal epithelium and the submucosal and myenteric plexuses. Morphometric analysis revealed that the GAL-Ir myenteric plexuses in the vicinity of tumor infiltration were significantly smaller in size than those in the intact section of the large intestine. Furthermore, no associations were identified between the clinicopathological characteristics of CRC patients and GAL serum and tissue concentration. The increased GAL serum concentrations observed in CRC patients in comparison to healthy controls may result from GAL secretion by CRC tumors, however, other sources of GAL cannot be excluded. The atrophy of myenteric plexuses within close proximity to the tumor may affect the colon function of CRC patients. In conclusion, investigation into the presence of GAL in the colon wall and serum of CRC patients revealed that serum and tissue GAL levels may present useful potential biomarkers in CRC patients.
