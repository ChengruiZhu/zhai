Transient receptor potential (TRP) cation channels are essential for normal cellular physiology, and their abnormal expression may lead to a number of disorders, including podocytopathy. Therefore, it is crucial to understand the mechanisms underlying the regulation of TRP channels. In the present study, microRNA (miR)-135a was found to be upregulated in patients with focal segmental glomerulosclerosis and mice treated with adriamycin (ADR). In cultured podocytes, transforming growth factor (TGF)-β and ADR were found to promote miR-135a expression. Conversely, TRP channel 1 (TRPC1) protein levels were markedly downregulated in podocytes from mice treated with ADR, as well as in cultured podocytes treated with ADR and TGF-β. Ectopic expression of miR-135a led to severe podocyte injury and disarray of the podocyte cytoskeleton, whereas podocyte-specific expression of TRPC1 was able to reverse the pathological effects of miR-135a in cultured podocytes. Moreover, using Luciferase reporter assays and western blot analysis, TRPC1 was identified as a target gene of miR-135a. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to demonstrate the role of TRPC1 in the development of podocyte injury and disorders of the podocyte cytoskeleton, which may contribute to the development of novel therapeutics for podocyte injury-associated kidney diseases.
