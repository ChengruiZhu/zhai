 sensors with calcium release–activated calcium (CRAC) channels (CRACM1/2/3 or Orai1/2/3) in the plasma membrane. Here, we report structural requirements of STIM1-mediated activation of CRACM1 and CRACM3 using truncations, point mutations, and CRACM1/CRACM3 chimeras. In accordance with previous studies, truncating the N-terminal region of CRACM1 or CRACM3 revealed a 20–amino acid stretch close to the plasma membrane important for channel gating. Exchanging the N-terminal region of CRACM3 with that of CRACM1 (CRACM3-N(M1)) results in accelerated kinetics and enhanced current amplitudes. Conversely, transplanting the N-terminal region of CRACM3 into CRACM1 (CRACM1-N(M3)) leads to severely reduced store-operated currents. Highly conserved amino acids (K85 in CRACM1 and K60 in CRACM3) in the N-terminal region close to the first transmembrane domain are crucial for STIM1-dependent gating of CRAC channels. Single-point mutations of this residue (K85E and K60E) eliminate store-operated currents induced by inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate and reduce store-independent gating by 2-aminoethoxydiphenyl borate. However, short fragments of these mutant channels are still able to communicate with the CRAC-activating domain of STIM1. Collectively, these findings identify a single amino acid in the N terminus of CRAC channels as a critical element for store-operated gating of CRAC channels.
