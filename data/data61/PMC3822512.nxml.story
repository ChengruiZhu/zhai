 cells, and lymphatic and macrovascular endothelial cells (EC) isolated from human foreskins and umbilical veins, respectively. Under appropriate culture conditions, EPC developed into fully matured EC with expression of similar endothelial markers as lymphatic and macrovascular EC, including CD31, CD36, von Willebrand factor FVIII, CD54 (ICAM-1), CD105 (endoglin), CD144 (VE-cadherin), Tie-1, Tie-2, VEGFR-1/Flt-1 and VEGFR-2/Flk-1. Few EPC-derived cells became positive for LYVE-1, indicating their origin from haematopoietic stem cells. However they lacked expression of other lymphatic cell-specific markers such as podoplanin and Prox-1. Functional tests demonstrated that the cobblestone EPC-derived cells up-regulated CD54 and CD62E expression in response to TNF-α, incorporated DiI-acetylated low-density liproprotein and formed cord- and tubular-like structures with capillary lumen in three-dimensional collagen culture – all characteristic features of the vascular endothelium. Structures compatible with Weibel-Palade bodies were also found by electron microscopy. Gene microarray profiling revealed that only a small percentage of genes investigated showed differential expression in EPC-derived cells and lymphatic EC. Among them were adhesion molecules, extracellular matrix proteins and cytokines. Our data point to the close lineage relationship of both types of vascular cells and support the theory of a venous origin of the lymphatic system.
