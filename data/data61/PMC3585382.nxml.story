Calcium levels inside myocytes regulate the heart's force of contraction. Calcium is released from the primary intracellular store called the sarcoplasmic reticulum. Calcium release was directly observed as ‘calcium sparks’ using fluorescent calcium indicators inside the cell. More recently, calcium levels inside the store have been measured as calcium ‘blinks’. These suggest that some depletion of store calcium occurs during cell excitation; however, the actual extent of depletion is made uncertain by the complex sarcoplasmic reticulum shape, dye saturation and optical properties of the microscope. While previous studies have assumed idealized microscope properties, we measured microscope blurring and applied it to a computer model of calcium movements inside the cell. In this model, calcium release was adjusted to match the simulated blurred calcium signals to experimental results. The calculations show that the depth of local sarcoplasmic reticulum calcium depletion is much greater than inferred from calcium blinks and that the time-course of calcium release is affected by this depletion. An estimate for the time-course of gating of the ion channels that regulate calcium release inside the cell was also calculated. We suggest that the time-course of SR Ca release arises from a complex interaction of Ca depletion and channel gating.
