Peripheral nerves consist mainly of axons and Schwann cells, which form myelin sheaths around axons. Peripheral neuropathies primarily affect axons, their myelin, or both. Etiologies are multiple: they can be inherited, autoimmune, infectious, metabolic (e.g., diabetes), or be due to tumors or toxic agents. However, the pathogenesis mechanisms of these disorders are not well understood. Here, we elucidate a novel critical mechanism in peripheral nerves for the stability of two adjacent structures of major importance for axonal function, the paranodes and nodes of Ranvier. We find that disruption of these structures causes a form of peripheral neuropathy. Ablation of the transcriptional regulators histone deacetylases (HDAC)1 and 2 in adult Schwann cells results in motor and sensory dysfunction, disruption of paranodal/nodal integrity, and loss of myelin. Expression of the HDAC1/2 target gene myelin protein zero (P0) was reduced by half, leading to altered localization of paranodal and nodal neurofascins, loss of paranodal Caspr, and impairment of axon–Schwann cell interaction in paranodal/nodal regions. We demonstrate that P0, the most abundant protein of peripheral compact myelin, extends to paranodes/nodes to maintain their stability by binding neurofascins. P0–neurofascins binding is affected by P0 mutations responsible for late onset forms of the inherited peripheral neuropathy Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease, identifying a pathogenesis mechanism of these disorders.
