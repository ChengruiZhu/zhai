 B pathway. This therapeutic, interventional, open, randomized, evaluator-blinded and comparative trial included 38 adult women with moderate facial acne and 10 age-matched controls, all aged between 26 and 44 years. Two treatments were performed over six months: 15% azelaic acid gel (AA) bid (n = 18) and oral contraceptive (COC) drospirenone 3 mg/ethinylestradiol .02 mg (n = 20). Biopsies were taken at baseline (control, lesion, perilesional) and at the conclusion (lesion and perilesional) of the study to evaluate TLR-2 expression by immunohistochemistry. Lesion count and blind photographic evaluation were used for efficacy. The groups were homogeneous: 70% of lesions were located in the submandibular area, 95% of participants had inflammatory lesions; of these, 50% had persistent and 50% had late-onset acne. The mean ages were 33.7 ± 5.5 and 33.1 ± 5.3 years (COC and AA group, respectively). A moderate clinical improvement was observed in both groups. No difference in TLR-2 expression in the lesion or perilesional areas was observed; however, reduced TLR-2 expression was seen in the control group. A significant reduction in expression was observed after both treatments, with no difference between the groups. This finding suggests an anti-inflammatory effect of COCs and AA in adult female acne, via modulation of the TLR-2 receptor.
