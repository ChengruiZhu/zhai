The secondary demise of healthy neurons upon the degeneration of neurons harboring primary genetic defect(s) is hallmark to neurodegenerative diseases. However, the factors and mechanisms driving these cell-death processes are not understood, a severe limitation which has hampered the therapeutic development of neuroprotective approaches. The neuroretina is comprised of two main types of photoreceptor neurons, rods and cones. These undergo degeneration upon heterogeneous mutations or environmental stressors and the underlying diseases present conspicuous spatiotemporal pathological signatures whose molecular bases are not understood. We employed the multifunctional protein, Ran-binding protein-2 (Ranbp2), which is implicated in cell-type and stress-dependent clinical manifestations, to examine its role(s) in primary and secondary photoreceptor death mechanisms upon its specific loss in cones. Contrary to prior findings, we found that dying cones can trigger the loss of healthy rods. This process arises by the immediate activation of novel Ranbp2-responsive factors and downstream cascade events in cones that promote extrinsically the demise of rods. The mechanisms of rod and cone demise are molecularly distinct. Collectively, the data uncover distinct Ranbp2 roles in intrinsic and extrinsic cell-death and will likely contribute to our understanding of the spatiotemporal onset and progression of diseases affecting photoreceptor mosaics and other neural networks.
