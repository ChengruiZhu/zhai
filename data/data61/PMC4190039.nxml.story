Females develop multiple hormonal alterations and certain genes may be involved in the intensity of subsequent symptoms including both mood and drug seeking. Seventy Four (74) females were included (mean age=60.23, SD=9.21, [43-87]). A medical evaluation was completed with hormone screening using a number of statistical analyses such as Pearson product moment; one way ANOVA and Regression analysis along with a Bonferroni significance correction p<.004. Of 120 correlations performed, significant hormone/domain correlations were as follows: DHEA/Genitourinary (r=.30, p<.05); FSH/Pulmonary (r=−.29, p<.05); Pregnenolone/Genitourinary (r=.40, p<.006) /Immunological (r=.38, p<.008); Testosterone/total endorsed symptoms (r=−0.34, p<.016); TSH/Pulmonary (r=−.33, p<.03) /Gynecological (r=.30, p<.05). Estrone/Musculoskeletal (r=−0.43, p<.012). After a Bonferroni correction (experiment-wise p<.00045) for statistical significance, no hormones remained significance. In the follow–up phase FSH/Neuropsychiatric (r=.56, p<.05) and Musculoskeletal (r=.67, p<.013); DHEA/Immunological (r=.64, p<.04); LH/ Musculoskeletal (r=.59, p<.34); Free Testosterone/Neuropsychiatric (r=.64, p<.019), Musculoskeletal (r=.68, p<.01), and Dermatologic (r=.57, p<.04); Total Testosterone/Immunological (r=.63, p<.028); TSH/Endocrinological (r=−.62, p<.031). Factor analysis of the MQ yielded two factors with eigenvalues > 1.0 (high loadings: first: Pulmonary, GI, Cardiovascular, and Immunological; second: Musculoskeletal, Gynecological, and the three Neurological domains). Both factors had significant correlations: first/pregnenolone (r=.37, p<.019); second/TSH (r=.33, p<.034). An additional factor analysis of hormone level clusters showed significant correlations with various domains. This study highlights the need to test the core biological endocrine hormones associated with females. Future research will focus on the relationship of for example Leptin and the electrophysiology of the brain. We are cautiously proposing a new paradigm shift whereby we replace the old nomenclature of HRT to MHRT.
