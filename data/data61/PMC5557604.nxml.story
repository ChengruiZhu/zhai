Phylogenetic networks are used to represent reticulate evolution, that is, cases in which the tree-of-life metaphor for evolution breaks down, because some of its branches have merged at one or several points in the past. This may occur, for example, when some organisms in the phylogeny are hybrids. In this paper, we deal with an elementary question for the reconstruction of phylogenetic networks: how to explore the space of all possible networks. The fundamental component for this is the set of operations that should be employed to generate alternative hypotheses for what happened in the pastâ€”which serve as basic blocks for optimization techniques such as hill-climbing. Although these approaches have a long tradition in classic tree-based phylogenetics, their application to networks that explicitly represent reticulate evolution is relatively unexplored. This paper provides the fundamental definitions and theoretical results for subsequent work in practical methods for phylogenetic network reconstruction: we subdivide networks into layers, according to a generally-accepted measure of their complexity, and provide operations that allow both to fully explore each layer, and to move across different layers. These operations constitute natural generalizations of well-known operations for the exploration of the space of phylogenetic trees, the lowest layer in the hierarchy described above.
