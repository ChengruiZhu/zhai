The mean values of all the anthropometric indices studied increased from normotension, through prehypertension to hypertension in both genders. BMI, WC, HC and CI were significantly higher (p < 0.05) in females than males. All the anthropometric indices studied were significantly (p < 0.001 except for CI) correlated with systolic and diastolic blood pressure. BMI, WHtR, WC and PI (with higher correlation coefficients for blood pressure) showed the best potential potential to predict hypertension and prehypertension in the study: BMI (cut-off = 24.49, AUC = 0.698; cut-off = 23.62, AUC = 0.659), WHtR (cut-off = 0.55, AUC = 0.682; cut-off = 0.5, AUC = 0.636), WC (cut-off = 91.44, AUC = 0.692; cut-off = 82.55, AUC = 0.645), PI (cut-off = 14.45, AUC = 0.670; cut-off = 13.69, AUC = 0.639), in males; and BMI (cut-off = 24.44, AUC = 0.622; cut-off = 28.01, AUC = 0.609), WHtR (cut-off = 0.51, AUC = 0.624; cut-off = 0.6, AUC = 0.572), WC (cut-off = 96.62, AUC = 0.616; cut-off = 96.52, AUC = 0.584), PI (cut-off = 16.38, AUC = 0.619; cut-off = 17.65, AUC = 0.599), in females for hypertension and prehypertension, respectively. In predicting hypertension risk, WC and WHtR did not significantly improve the performance of BMI in the models when included using our decision rule. Overall, CI had a very poor discriminatory power for both conditions in this study.
