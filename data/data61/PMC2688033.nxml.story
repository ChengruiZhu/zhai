Proteins encoded within a given genome are known to evolve at drastically different rates. Through recent large-scale studies, researchers have measured a wide variety of properties for all proteins in yeast. We are interested to know how these properties relate to one another and to what extent they explain evolutionary rate variation. Protein properties are a heterogeneous mix, a factor which complicates research in this area. For example, some properties (e.g., protein abundance) are numerical, while others (e.g., protein function) are descriptive; protein properties may also suffer from noise and hidden redundancies. We have addressed these issues within a flexible and robust statistical framework. We first ranked a large list of protein properties by the strength of their relationships with evolutionary rate; this confirms many known evolutionary relationships and also highlights several new ones. Similar protein properties were then grouped and applied to predict slowly evolving proteins. Some of these groups were as effective as paired species comparison in making correct predictions, although in both cases a great deal of evolutionary rate variation remained to be explained. Our work has helped to refine the set of protein properties that researchers should consider as they investigate the mechanisms underlying protein evolution.
