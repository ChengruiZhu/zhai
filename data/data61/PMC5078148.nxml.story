 using electron microscope observations. In this study, vitellogenesis during oogenesis in the oocytes occured by way of autosynthesis and heterosynthesis. Of two processes of vitellogenesis during oogenesis, the process of endogenous autosynthesis involved the combined activity of the Golgi complex, mitochondria and rough endoplasmic reticulum. However, the process of exogenous heterosynthesis involved endocytotic incorporation of extraovarian precursors at the basal region of the oolema of the early vitellogenic oocytes before the formation of the vitelline coat. In this study, follicle cells, which attached to the previtellogenic and vitellogenic oocytes, were easily found. In particular, the follicle cells were involved in the development of previtellogenic oocytes by the supply of nutrients, and vitellogenesis in the early and late vitellogenic oocytes by endocytosis of yolk precursors. Based on observations of follicle cells attached to degenerating oocytes after spawning, follicles of this species are involved in lysosomal induction of oocyte degeneration for the resorption phagosomes (phagolysosomes) in the cytoplasm for nutrient storage, as seen in other bivalves. In this study, the functions of follicle cells can accumulate reserves of lipid granules and glycogen particles for vitellogenesis from degenerating oocytes after spawning.
