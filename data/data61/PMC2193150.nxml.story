Reportedly, antiapoptotic Bcl-2 family proteins suppress apoptosis by binding to and inhibiting members of the CED-4 family of caspase activators. To explore this question, we used embryonic stem (ES) cells in which one (−/+) or both (−/−) copies of the gene encoding apoptotic protease activating factor 1 (Apaf-1), a CED-4 homologue, were disrupted by homologous recombination. Stable clones of heterozygous (−/+) and homozygous (−/−) Apaf-1 knockout ES cells that overexpressed Bcl-2 were generated. Withdrawal of serum growth factors or stimulation of heterozygous ES cells with staurosporine (STS), ultraviolet (UV)B irradiation, etoposide (VP16), or cisplatin induced apoptosis followed by cell death (determined by failure to exclude propidium iodide dye). These cell death stimuli also induced activation of several types of caspases and loss of mitochondrial membrane potential (ΔΨ) in heterozygous (+/−) Apaf-1 knockout ES cells. In addition, overexpression of Bcl-2 protected against these events in Apaf-1–expressing ES cells. In contrast, STS, UVB, and VP16 induced little or no caspase activation and apoptosis in homozygous (−/−) Apaf-1 knockout ES cells. Nevertheless, Apaf-1–deficient ES cells subjected to these cell death stimuli or deprived of growth factors did eventually die through a nonapoptotic mechanism associated with loss of ΔΨ. Moreover, Bcl-2 overprotection preserved ΔΨ, reduced the percentage of Apaf-1
