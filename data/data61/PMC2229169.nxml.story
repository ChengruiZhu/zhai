Voltage-dependent K+ channels control repolarization of action potentials and help establish firing patterns in nerve cells. To determine the nature and role of molecular components that modulate K+ channel function in vivo, we coinjected Xenopus oocytes with cRNA encoding a cloned subthreshold A-type K+ channel (mShal1, also referred to as mKv4.1) and a low molecular weight (LMW) fraction (2-4 kb) of poly(A)+ mRNA (both from rodent brain). Coinjected oocytes exhibited a significant (fourfold) increase in the surface expression of mShal1 K+ channels with no change in the open-channel conductance. Coexpression also modified the gating kinetics of mShal1 current in several respects. Macroscopic inactivation of whole oocyte currents was fitted with the sum of two exponential components. Both fast and slow time constants of inactivation were accelerated at all membrane potentials in coinjected oocytes (tau f = 47.2 ms vs 56.5 ms at 0 mV and tau s = 157 ms vs 225 ms at 0 mV), and the corresponding ratios of amplitude terms were shifted toward domination by the fast component (Af/As = 2.71 vs 1.17 at 0 mV). Macroscopic activation was characterized in terms of the time-to-peak current, and it was found to be more rapid at all membrane potentials in coinjected oocytes (9.9 ms vs 13.5 ms at 0 mV). Coexpression also leads to more rapid recovery from inactivation (approximately 2.4-fold faster at -100 mV). The coexpressed K+ currents in oocytes resemble currents expressed in mouse fibroblasts (NIH3T3) transfected only with mShal1 cDNA. These results indicate that mammalian regulatory subunits or enzymes encoded by LMW mRNA species, which are apparently missing or expressed at low levels in Xenopus oocytes, may modulate gating in some native subthreshold A-type K+ channels.
