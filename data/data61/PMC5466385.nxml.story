Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM), one of the most common forms of myocardial diseases, is the major cause of sudden cardiac death in young adults and competitive athletes. Analyses of gene mutations associated with HCM are valuable for its molecular diagnosis, genetic counseling, and management of familial HCM. To dissect the relationship between the clinical presentation and gene mutations of HCM, the genetic characterizations of 19 HCM-related genes in 18 patients (8 cases from 6 pedigrees with familial HCM and 10 cases without familial HCM) were detected using next-generation sequencing (NGS). As a result, 12 disease-related mutations were identified in the 18 subjects, including 6 single mutations and 3 double mutations [MYBPC3 (p.Gln998Glu) plus TNNI3 (p.Arg145Gly), PRKAG2 (p.Gly100Ser) plus MYBPC3 (p.Lys1209Serfs*28) and TNNI3 (p.Glu124Gln) plus GLA (p.Trp47*)]. The 3 heterozygous double mutations were discovered for the first time in the malignant familial HCM patients. Of the 6 single mutations, a novel mutation was found in tafazzin (TAZ, p.Ile208Val), and a mutation in Î²-myosin heavy chain gene (MYH7, p.Arg54Gln), which was reported as rare in the general population, was firstly found in one HCM patient. Identification of novel and rare mutations in HCM patients have added new data to the spectrum of gene mutations associated with this disease. These findings provide an essential basis for the molecular diagnosis and better management of family members at risk of familial HCM.
