The fact that the brain generates weak but measurable electromagnetic waves has intrigued neuroscientists for over a century. Even more remarkable is the fact that these oscillations of brain activity correlate with the state of awareness and that their frequency and amplitude display reproducible features that are different in health and disease. In healthy conditions, oscillations of different frequency bands tend to minimize interference. This is similar to radio stations avoiding overlap between frequency bands to ensure clear transmission. During epileptic seizures, mutual entrainment, analogous to interference of radio signals, has also been reported. Moreover, in schizophrenia and autism, there is a loss of higher frequency oscillations. Most studies thus far have focused on the mechanisms generating the oscillations, as well as on their functional relevance. In contrast, our study focuses on what brain rhythms tell us about the functional network organization of the brain. Using a reverse-engineering approach, we construct abstract networks (virtual brains) that display oscillations of actual brains. These networks reveal that brain rhythms reflect different levels of hierarchical organization in health and disease. We predict specific alterations in brain connectivity in the aforementioned diseases and explain how clinicians and experimentalists can test our predictions.
