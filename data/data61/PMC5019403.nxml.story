The mammalian neocortex is the brain structure responsible for higher cognition, abstract thought, and language. One process critical for brain development is neurogenesis, in which neural stem cell populations generate neurons. Alterations in neurogenesis can lead to neurodevelopmental disorders affecting brain size and function, such as microcephaly, in which the brain is significantly smaller than normal. Therefore, understanding the genes and processes controlling normal brain development is of strong clinical relevance. Here we studied proteins of the RNA binding exon junction complex, which are strongly implicated in several neurodevelopmental pathologies, but whose functions in brain development remain largely unknown. Using mouse models, we find that reduced levels of any of three essential proteins of this complex results in altered embryonic neurogenesis and microcephaly. We demonstrate that mutant mice show common alterations in p53 activation, expression of ribosomal components and splice variants for RNA processing factors. Interestingly we find that genetic suppression of p53 significantly rescues microcephaly in mutant mice. Given that patients harboring mutations in exon junction complex components present with neurodevelopmental deficits, our findings highlight molecular pathways which could underlie disease pathogenesis.
