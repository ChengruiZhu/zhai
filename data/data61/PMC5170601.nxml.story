Human mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are considered to be a promising source of cells in regenerative medicine. They have large potential to differentiate into various tissue-specific populations and may be isolated from diverse tissues in desired quantities. As cells of potential autologous origin, they allow recipients to avoid the alloantigen responses. They also have the ability to create immunomodulatory microenvironment, and thus help to minimize organ damage caused by the inflammation and cells activated by the immune system. Our knowledge about the reparative, regenerative, and immunomodulatory properties of MSCs is advancing. At present, there is a very comprehensible idea on how MSCs affect the immune system, particularly in relation to the tissue and organ damage on immunological basis. Hitherto a number of effective mechanisms have been described by which MSCs influence the immune responses. These mechanisms include a secretion of soluble bioactive agents, an induction of regulatory T cells, modulation of tolerogenic dendritic cells, as well as induction of anergy and apoptosis. MSCs are thus able to influence both innate and adaptive immune responses. Soluble factors that are released into local microenvironment with their subsequent paracrine effects are keys to the activation. As a result, activated MSCs contribute to the restoration of damaged tissues or organs through various mechanisms facilitating reparative and regenerative processes as well as through immunomodulation itself and differentiation into the cells of the target tissue.
