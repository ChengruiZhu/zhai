Decades of experimental evidence have underlined the fact that protein structures can hardly be considered as static objects. To understand how a protein achieves its biological purpose, it is therefore quite often necessary to unravel the complexity of its dynamical behavior. However, the definition of accurate and computationally tractable descriptions of protein dynamics remains a highly challenging task. Indeed, even though proteins are all built from a limited set of amino acids and local conformational arrangements, the specific nature of biologically relevant motions may vary widely from one protein to another, which constitutes a serious obstacle to the identification of common rules and properties. Here, instead of focusing on the study of a single protein, we adopt a more general perspective by condensing the information contained in a multitude of NMR conformational ensembles. This approach allows us to characterize the dynamical behavior of residues and residue pairs in a mean protein environment, independently of each protein's specific architecture. We describe how this analysis can be exploited to assess the performances of coarse-grained models of protein dynamics, to take advantage of existing experimental data for a more rational and efficient parametrization of these models and, ultimately, to improve our understanding of the intrinsic dynamical properties of amino acid chains.
