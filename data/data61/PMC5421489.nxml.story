We report a 63-year-old female with hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and prior pacemaker insertion for atrial fibrillation with symptomatic bradycardia, who was admitted with substernal chest pressure and diaphoresis. Her electrocardiogram revealed atrial fibrillation with demand ventricular pacing and her cardiac biomarkers were negative for acute coronary syndrome. Echocardiogram revealed normal left ventricular systolic function and normal aortic root diameter. Coronary angiography revealed 60-70% obtuse marginal lesion, otherwise mild disease. She was treated medically and discharged in stable condition. She was readmitted 1 month later with recurring chest pain, and shortness of breath which started shortly after her most recent discharge. Blood pressure was 152/93 mm Hg, and heart rate was 105 bpm. BNP was elevated at 1,400 pg/mL, and other cardiac biomarkers were negative. She was treated with diuretics, which resulted in decrease of her blood pressure to 81/51 mm Hg. Repeat echocardiogram revealed severely dilated aortic root, measuring 6.7 cm, with aortic dissection flap and moderate to severe aortic regurgitation. CT angiogram revealed aortic dissection extending proximally to the aortic root above the coronary ostia and distally to the left subclavian artery takeoff. She underwent surgery; she, however, could not be weaned off from cardiopulmonary bypass and died in the operating room. This case illustrates the importance of having a high index of suspicion for iatrogenic aortic dissection following cardiac catheterization as a cause of recurrence of cardiac symptoms, as early detection may help avert a catastrophic outcome, as we report in our patient.
