 do not stratify in homogeneous layers, we have obtained the following strata beginning with the centripetal end: lipid droplets, pronucleus, clear zone, mitochondria, yolk, and pigment. Whereas mitochondria may be found mingled with yolk bodies, we have never observed lipid droplets nor pigment bodies among any of the other inclusions. The so-called clear zone contains a heterogeneous population of inclusions: annulate lamellae, heavy bodies, Golgi complexes, and rod-containing vacuoles. The peripheral cortical granules of immature (germinal vesicle stage) and of mature eggs are not dislodged from the cortical ooplasm with the centrifugal force utilized. When the eggs are treated with urethane, prior to centrifugation, the cortical granules of mature eggs abandon their peripheral position. Further centrifugation of the initially stratified eggs produces nucleated and nonnucleated halves and the centrifugation of the halves results in quarters. The cytology of the halves and quarters is discussed. The halves and quarters have been activated with either sperm or hypertonic sea water. With the exception of the nucleated halves, we were unable to obtain plutei larvae from the other fractions (red halves and quarters). We believe that the lack of development of the various fragments is a function of the balance of particular inclusions necessary for differentiation.
