Multicellular organisms universally senesce and must produce rejuvenated progenies in order to transmit life. Although similar age-related deterioration in physiological functions and reproduction is also found in unicellular organisms that divide asymmetrically to produce morphologically distinct aged and younger cells, it has been unclear whether symmetrically dividing microbes—such as fission yeast—exhibit the same traits. Using long-term live-cell microscopy combined with a microfluidic device, we monitor the growth and death of a large number of fission yeast cells and demonstrate the existence of aging-free lineages. These lineages are, however, not immortal, and the probability of death increases as the cells grow more rapidly; thus, the “live fast, die fast” trade-off exists in fission yeast. We further characterize the segregation and inheritance of protein aggregates, which are commonly thought of as “aging factors.” The aging-free lineages bear the aggregate load for some generations with no apparent adverse effects on growth. We also show that there is no threshold amount of protein aggregate above which cells are destined to death in both normal and stressed conditions: protein aggregate is thus not a direct initiation signal for cell death. Our data reveal that protein aggregation might not be an appropriate index for aging and that we should revisit its role in cell physiology.
