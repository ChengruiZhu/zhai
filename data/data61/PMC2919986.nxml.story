Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), which occurs mostly in individuals over the age of 40, accounts for 12–15% of all primary brain tumors. Patients with GBM have a poor prognosis, even after aggressive upfront therapies. The present study documents that in 5 of these patients, the use of a novel immunotherapeutic approach combined with standard initial therapies resulted in a prolonged survival of over 3 years, which is significantly longer than the expected survival time with conventional therapies. During the course of intravenous cell-transfer immunotherapy, axial magnetic resonance images of the tumor region were monitored for over 5 years. The discontinuation of adoptive transfer regimens resulted in the rapid deterioration of patients with development of Gd-enhancing regions, indicating the initiation of tumor recurrence. Among patients with recurrence, the reinstatement of adoptive cell regimens with more frequent cell-transfers resulted in an apparent re-regression of tumors. Significantly longer survival times were seen in patients receiving transferred autologous lymphoid cells which were expanded in vitro, and which had a considerable proportion of γδT cells. We conclude that immunotherapy, combined with standard treatment, plays a significant role in the management of GBM patients and provides patients with a better prognosis.
