We performed a study to investigate the status of thyroid nodules and thyroid functions in Chinese breast cancer women. The clinical data of female patients with breast cancer or benign breast diseases and normal populace were evaluated. The thyroxine(T4) level in initially diagnosed breast cancer patients were significantly higher than those in benign breast diseases patients (7.68±1.51 vs 7.29±1.52ug/dl, p<0.001), while the TSH levels were slightly lower than in benign breast diseases patients(3.23±4.59 vs 3.60±6.74uIU/ml, p=0.302). The overall incidence of hypothyroidism in initially diagnosed breast cancer and benign breast diseases patients were 28.65% and 32.74%(p=0.195). During chemotherapy, the T4(7.08±1.69ug/dl), fT3(2.87±0.48pg/ml) and fT4(0.83±0.15ng/dl) levels were significantly lower than in initially diagnosed breast cancer patients(7.68±1.51ug/dl, 3.07±0.50pg/ml, 0.88±0.20ng/dl, p<0.05). The incidence of thyroid nodules in initially diagnosed breast cancer patients, benign breast diseases patients and healthy population were 56.17%, 43.64%, 34.49%(p<0.001). The incidence of TI-RADS≥4 TN in initially diagnosed breast cancer patients and benign breast diseases patients were significantly higher than in normal population(7.27% vs 9.45% vs 2.87%, p<0.001). The incidence of TI-RADS≥4 thyroid nodules in breast cancer patients receiving chemotherapy was significantly higher than in initially diagnosed breast cancer patients(11.71% vs 7.27%, p<0.05). These data indicate that the incidence of thyroid disease in breast disease patients is higher than in normal population in China, and the breast diseases, especially breast cancer, might be related to the high incidence of thyroid nodules.
