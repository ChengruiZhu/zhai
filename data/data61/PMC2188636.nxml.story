Normodense human peripheral blood eosinophils were isolated under sterile conditions from the 22/23 and 23/24% interfaces and the cell pellet of metrizamide gradients. After culture for 7 d in RPMI media in the presence of 50 pM biosynthetic (recombinant) human granulocyte/macrophage colony-stimulating factor (rH GM-CSF), 43 +/- 7% (mean +/- SEM, n = 8) of the cells were viable; in the absence of rH GM- CSF, no eosinophils survived. The rH GM-CSF-mediated viability was concentration dependent; increased survival began at a concentration of 1 pM, a 50% maximal response was attained at approximately 3 pM, and a maximal effect was reached at concentrations of greater than or equal to 10 pM rH GM-CSF. In the presence of rH GM-CSF and mouse 3T3 fibroblasts, 67 +/- 6% (mean +/- SEM, n = 8) of the eosinophils survived for 7 d. In a comparative analysis, there was no difference in eosinophil viability after 7 and 14 d (n = 3) in the presence of 50 pM GM-CSF and fibroblasts. Culture with fibroblasts alone did not support eosinophil survival. The addition of fibroblast-conditioned media to rH GM-CSF did not further improve eosinophil viability, indicating a primary role for GM-CSF in supporting these eosinophil cell suspensions ex vivo and a supplementary role for 3T3 fibroblasts. Eosinophils cultured for 7 d localized on density gradient sedimentation at the medium/18, 18/20, and 20/21 interfaces of metrizamide gradients, indicating a change to the hypodense phenotype from their original normodense condition. In addition, the cultured eosinophils generated approximately 2.5-fold more LTC4 than freshly isolated cells when stimulated with the calcium ionophore A23187 and manifested sevenfold greater antibody-dependent killing of S. mansoni larvae than the freshly isolated, normodense cells from the same donor. Thus we demonstrate the rH GM-CSF dependent conversion in vitro of normodense human eosinophils to hypodense cells possessing the augmented biochemical and biological properties characteristic of the hypodense eosinophils associated with a variety of hypereosinophilic syndromes. In addition, these studies provide a culture model of at least 14 d suitable for the further characterization of hypodense eosinophils.
