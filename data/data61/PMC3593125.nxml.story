Endoplasmic reticulum stress is related to metabolic disorders, including atherosclerosis and type 2 diabetes. It is known that inflammatory adipocytokines and oxidative stress are increased, while anti-inflammatory adipocytokines such as adiponectin are decreased in adipocytes during above conditions. Extracellular-superoxide dismutase is an anti-inflammatory enzyme that protects cells from oxidative stress. Because plasma extracellular-superoxide dismutase levels in type 2 diabetes patients were inversely related to the body mass index and homeostasis model assessment-insulin resistance index, it is speculated that the regulation of extracellular-superoxide dismutase might lead to the suppression of metabolic disorders. Here, we observed the reduction of extracellular-superoxide dismutase and adiponectin in 3T3-L1 adipocytes treated with thapsigargin, an endoplasmic reticulum stress inducer. Interestingly, tunicamycin, another endoplasmic reticulum stress inducer, did not decrease the expression of extracellular-superoxide dismutase in spite of the induction of glucose regulated protein kinase 78 kDa, an endoplasmic reticulum stress marker. Moreover, eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2α signaling cascade plays a pivotal role in the reduction of extracellular-superoxide dismutase in 3T3-L1 adipocytes during endoplasmic reticulum stress conditions.
