Artifacts in two-dimensional electrophoresis (2-DE) caused by the presence of salts in isoelectric focusing (IEF) have been previously described as a result of increasing conductivity and inducing electroosmosis. However, electrolysis induced by the presence of salts should not be disregarded. In this study, electrolytic reductionâˆ’oxidation reaction (redox) was found to be enhanced in the presence of salts in IEF. The consequence of the electrolytic redox leads to acidification of the low-pH region and alkalization of the high-pH region within the immobilized pH gradient (IPG) strip. As a result, a breakdown of immobilized pH buffer near the high pH region of IPG strips along with reduction of basic proteins resulted in uncharacterized artifacts in 2-DE. Electrolytic reduction in the presence of alkali and alkaline metal ions was demonstrated to reduce 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT), protein disulfide bonds, and protein carboxylic acids. Importantly, semipreparative electrolytic reduction of proteins can be carried out in the presence of sodium ions in a homemade electrolytic apparatus. These findings give additional explanations to the observed artifacts in 2-DE and reveal the unknown effects of salts in IEF. Moreover, we have provided a method with the potential to convert proteins or peptides to corresponding modified products containing aldehyde groups that can be used for conjugation with amine-containing compounds.
