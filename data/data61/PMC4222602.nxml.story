The hair cycle represents a complex process of particular interest in the study of regulated proliferation, apoptosis and differentiation. While various modeling strategies are presented in the literature, none attempt to link extensive molecular details, provided by high-throughput experiments, with high-level, system properties. Thus, we re-analyzed a previously published mRNA expression time course study and found that we could readily identify a sizeable subset of genes that was expressed in synchrony with the hair cycle itself. The data is summarized in a dynamic, mathematical model of coupled oscillators. We demonstrate that a particular coupling scheme is sufficient to explain the observed synchronization. Further analysis associated specific expression patterns to general yet distinct cell populations, background mesenchymal and rapidly expanding follicular epithelial cells. Experimental imaging results are presented to show the localization of candidate genes from each population. Taken together, the results describe a possible mechanism for regulation between epithelial and mesenchymal populations. We also described an alternate state similar to hair miniaturization, which is predicted by the oscillator model. This study exemplifies the strengths of combining systems-level analysis with high-throughput experimental data to obtain a novel view of a complex system such as the hair cycle.
