Spherical droplets, derived from Physarum plasmodia by incubation in 10 mM caffeine, seemed to be an excellent system for electrophysiological studies because they were large (less than or equal to 300 micrometer in diameter) and because they tolerated intracellular electrodes filled with 3 M KCl and 10 mM EDTA for a few hours. Intact plasmodia, by contrast, gave valid records for only a few minutes. Under standard conditions ([K+]o = 1 mM, [Na+]o = 5 mM, [Ca++]0 = 0.5 mM, [Mg++]o = 2 mM, and [Cl-]o = 6 mM at pH 7.0), the potential difference across droplet membranes was -80 to -120mV, interior negative. The membrane potential was only slightly sensitive to concentration changes for the above-mentioned ions, and was far negative to the equilibrium diffusion potentials calculated from the known internal contents of K, Na, Ca, Mg, and CL (29.4, 1.6, 3.7, 6.5, and 27.8 mmol/kg, respectively). Variations of external pH did have a strong influence on the membrane potential, yielding a slope of 59 mV/pH between pH 6.5 and 5.5. In this pH range, however, the equilibrium potential for H+ (assuming 6.2 less than or equal to pHi less than or equal to 7.0) was greater than 75 mV positive to the observed membrane potential. Membrane potential was directly responsive to metabolic events, being lowered by potassium cyanide, and by cooling from 25 to 12 degrees C. This ensemble of results strongly indicates that the major component of membrane potential in plasmodial droplets of Physarum is generated by an electrogenic ion pump, probably one extruding H+ ions.
