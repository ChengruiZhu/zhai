Sexually reproducing parents use meiosis to generate specialized cells in which chromosome sets are reduced from two to one. Accurate chromosome reduction relies on the prior establishment of pair-wise associations between homologous chromosomes (homologs); maintenance of paired associations typically occurs via interhomolog crossover recombination events. The proteinaceous, structurally conserved synaptonemal complex (SC) assembles along the full length of aligned homolog axes. The SC is the context in which crossover recombination events mature, and it influences both the level and distribution of crossover events between homologs. However it is not clear whether the SC maintains the capacity to remodel, for example to structurally accommodate recombination events. We explore the dynamics of budding yeast SC and find that full-length SCs exhibit ongoing subunit incorporation but little subunit turnover during a meiotic cell cycle arrest, thus SC grows over time. Interestingly, initial subunit incorporation into full-length SCs occurs predominantly at or adjacent to Zip3 foci, a presumed marker of crossover sites. Our observations suggest that budding yeast SC continues to assemble during a steady state and that, while it may have little capacity for global turnover after installation, the SC maintains differential assembly dynamics at recombination-associated perturbations in the meiotic axis.
