Wild‐type and lipocalin‐2 knockout mice were fed with standard chow or HFD. Immunoassays were performed for evaluating the circulating and tissue contents of lipocalin‐2. The relaxation and contraction of arteries were studied using a wire myograph. Blood pressure was monitored with implantable radio telemetry. Dietary obesity promoted the accumulation of lipocalin‐2 protein in blood and arteries. Deficiency of this adipokine protected mice from dietary obesity‐induced elevation of blood pressure. Mass spectrometry analysis revealed that human and murine lipocalin‐2 were modified by polyamination. Polyaminated lipocalin‐2 was rapidly cleared from the circulation. Adipose tissue was a major site for lipocalin‐2 deamidation. The circulating levels and the arterial accumulation of deamidated lipocalin‐2 were significantly enhanced by treatment with linoleic acid (18:2n−6), which bound to lipocalin‐2 with high affinity and prevented its interactions with matrix metalloproteinase 9 (MMP9). Combined administration of linoleic acid with lipocalin‐2 caused vascular inflammation and endothelial dysfunction and raised the blood pressure of mice receiving standard chow. A human lipocalin‐2 mutant with cysteine 87 replaced by alanine (C87A) contained less polyamines and exhibited a reduced capacity to form heterodimeric complexes with MMP9. After treatment, C87A remained in the circulation for a prolonged period of time and evoked endothelial dysfunction in the absence of linoleic acid.
