 studies using green fluorescent protein (GFP)-LC3 mouse microvessel preparations revealed that ethanol treatment alters autophagy in endothelial cells. Primary cultures of mouse brain microvascular endothelial cells were used to characterize the underlying molecular mechanisms. LC3 and p62 protein levels were significantly increased in endothelial cells treated with 50 mM ethanol. The increase of autophagic vacuole number may be due to excessive autophagosome formation associated with the partial inhibition of the mammalian target of rapamycin pathway upon ethanol exposure. In addition, the progression from autophagosomes to autolysosomes, which was monitored using autophagic flux inhibitors and mRFP–EGFP vector, showed a decrease in the autolysosome number. Besides, a decrease in the Rab7 protein level was observed that may underlie the impairment of autophagosome–lysosome fusion. In addition, our results showed that ethanol-induced cell death is likely to be mediated by decreased mitochondrial integrity and release of apoptosis-inducing factor. Interestingly, incubation of cultured cells with rapamycin prevented ethanol effects on autophagic flux, ethanol-induced cell death and vascular plasticity. Taken together, these results are consistent with autophagy dysregulation in cortical microvessels upon ethanol exposure, which could contribute to the defects in angiogenesis observed in patients with FAS. Moreover, our results suggest that rapamycin represents a potential therapeutic strategy to reduce PAE-related brain developmental disorders.
