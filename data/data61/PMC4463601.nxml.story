The high affinity immunoglobulin E (IgE) receptor-FcεR1 is mainly expressed on the surface of effector cells. Cross-linking of IgE Abs bound to FcεR1 by multi-valent antigens can induce the activation of these cells and the secretion of inflammatory mediators. Since FcεR1 plays a central role in the induction and maintenance of allergic responses, this study aimed to investigate the association of FcεR1 with the allergic phenotype of Cε expression and cytokine and histamine release from peripheral leukocytes. Peripheral leukocytes from 67 allergic and 50 non-allergic subjects were used for genotyping analysis. Peripheral mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were used for Cε expression and ELISpot analysis, while polymorphonuclear cells (PMNs) were used for histamine release. The association between genotype polymorphism of the FcεR1α promoter region (rs2427827 and rs2251746) and allergic features of Cε expression and histamine were analyzed, and their effects on leukocytes function were compared with wild type. The genotype polymorphisms of FcεR1α promoter region with CT and TT in rs2427827 and TC in rs2251746 were significantly higher in allergic patients than in non-allergic controls. Patients with single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) of FcεR1α promoter region had high levels of total IgE, mite-specific Der p 2 (Group 2 allergen of
