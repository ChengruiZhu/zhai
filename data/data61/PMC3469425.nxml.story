A number of normally soluble proteins can form amyloid structures in a process associated with neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases. Mature amyloid structures consist of large fibrils containing thousands of individual proteins aggregated into linear nanostructures; there is increasing evidence, however, that the toxic species responsible for neurodegeneration are not the mature fibrils themselves but rather lower molecular weight precursors commonly known as amyloid oligomers. Unfortunately, these early oligomers are commonly thermodynamically unstable and of nanometer scale dimensions, factors which make them highly challenging to probe in detail in experiments. We have used computer simulations of a model inspired by Alzheimer's Abeta peptide to investigate the early stages of protein aggregation. The results that we obtain were shown to fit Oosawa's polymerization theory, a finding which allows us to provide a connection between the microscopic molecular parameters and macroscopic growth. One crucial parameter is size of the nucleus, i.e. the basic oligomer existing at origin of the formation of each fiber. We have revealed a path for the formation of this nucleus and validate its size by several methods. Our results provide fundamental information for influencing the early stages of amyloid formation in a rational manner.
