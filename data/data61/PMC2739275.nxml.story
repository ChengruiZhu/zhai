The Large Tumor antigen (LTag) encoded by Simian Virus 40 (SV40) is a marvelous molecule that is not only a viral oncogene, but also an efficient molecular machine as a helicase that unwinds double helix DNA for genome replication, an essential process in all living organisms. LTag hexameric helicase uses the energy of ATP to power its conformational switch for DNA unwinding. Understanding how the LTag conformational switch is coupled to the energy from ATP usage by LTag to do the mechanical work of unwinding DNA is of great interest to biologists, and yet remains to be established. Based on our previous high-resolution structures of LTag helicase in different conformational states, we simulated an LTag conformational transition pathway in the ATP binding process using the targeted molecular dynamics method. Our simulation results suggest a three-step process for the ATP binding to the nucleotide pocket, in which ATP is eventually “locked” into the pocket by three pairs of “locker” interactions. We have also quantitatively evaluated the energy profile of ATP binding using a special computational simulation technique. Additionally, our simulation study of ATP binding by LTag and the accompanying conformational switches in the context of a hexamer leads to a refined cooperative iris model that may be used for DNA unwinding.
