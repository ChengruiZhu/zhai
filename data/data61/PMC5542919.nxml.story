The mannose-binding lectin (MBL) 2 gene has an important function in the innate immune response and activation of the third pathway of the complement system. Some studies have assessed the association of the MBL2 gene polymorphisms with cervicovaginal infections (CVI); however, there is no information about this association in Mexican women. This study aimed to determine the association between the MBL2 codons 54 and 57 gene polymorphisms with CVI in a sample of Mexican women. Through a cross-sectional study, blood samples and cervicovaginal cultures were obtain from 354 women. MBL2 genotyping was performed by real-time polymerase chain reaction with Taqman probes. Of the 354 women studied, 128 (36.2%) had CVI and 226 (63.8%) were healthy. The frequencies of the C and T variants in codon 54 in women with CVI were 83% and 17%, respectively; whereas the frequencies of these variants in healthy women were 82% and 18%, respectively. The frequencies of variants C/C, C/T, and T/T in women with CVI were 68%, 31%, and 1%, respectively; whereas the frequencies of these variants in healthy women were 68%, 29%, and 3%, respectively. With respect to codon 57, the frequencies of variants C and T were identical in women with CVI and in healthy women (97% and 3%, respectively). The frequencies of variants C/C, C/T, and T/T were identical in women with CVI and in healthy women (94%, 6%, and 0%, respectively). We conclude that MBL2 codons 54 and 57 gene polymorphisms do not associate with CVI in Mexican women.
