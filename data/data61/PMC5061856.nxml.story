 genera, with the aim to discriminate between the different species. For the purpose of analysing the lipids extracted from these bacterial samples, two rapid physicochemical techniques were used: matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionisation time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF-MS) and liquid chromatography in conjunction with mass spectrometry (LC-MS). The findings of this investigation confirmed that MALDI-TOF-MS could be used to identify different bacterial lipids and, in combination with appropriate chemometrics, allowed for the discrimination between these different bacterial species, which was supported by LC-MS. The average correct classification rates for the seven species of bacteria were 62.23 and 77.03Â % based on MALDI-TOF-MS and LC-MS data, respectively. The Procrustes distance for the two datasets was 0.0699, indicating that the results from the two techniques were very similar. In addition, we also compared these bacterial lipid MALDI-TOF-MS profiles to protein profiles also collected by MALDI-TOF-MS on the same bacteria (Procrustes distance, 0.1006). The level of discrimination between lipids and proteins was equivalent, and this further indicated the potential of MALDI-TOF-MS analysis as a rapid, robust and reliable method for the classification of bacteria based on different bacterial chemical components.
