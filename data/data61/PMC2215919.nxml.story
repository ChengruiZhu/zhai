The influence of phosphocreatine in the presence or absence of MgATP and MgADP was studied in Triton X-100-treated thin papillary muscles and ventricular strips of the rat heart. The pCa/tension relationships, the pMgATP/tension relationships, and the tension responses to quick length changes were analyzed. The results show three major consequences of the reduction of the phosphocreatine concentration in the presence of millimolar concentrations of the MgATP. (a) The resting tension and the maximal Ca2+-activated tension were increased, and the pCa/tension relationship was shifted toward higher pCa values and its steepness was decreased; these effects were enhanced by the inclusion of MgADP. (b) The time constant of tension recoveries after quick stretches applied during maximal activation was increased, while the extent of these recoveries was decreased. (c) The study of pMgATP/tension relationships in low Ca concentrations showed that the decrease in phosphocreatine induced a shift toward higher MgATP values with no changes in maximal rigor tension or the slope coefficient; these effects were increased by the increase in MgADP and were independent of the preparation diameter. Thus, modifications of the apparent Ca sensitivity and resting and maximal tension when phosphocreatine is decreased seem to be due to an increasing participation of rigor-like or slowly cycling cross-bridges spending more time in the attached state. These results suggest that endogenous creatine kinase is able to ensure maximal efficiency of myosin ATPase by producing a local high MgATP/MgADP ratio.
