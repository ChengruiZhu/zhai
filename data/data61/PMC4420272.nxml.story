In the adult mammary gland, tissue architecture is maintained through the regulation of the polarity of epithelial cells, which organize around a central cavity called the lumen. The mammary epithelium comprises a basal layer, which contains myoepithelial contractile cells and so-called mammary stem cells, and a luminal layer of cells organized around the lumen. The establishment of apical-basolateral polarity in luminal cells allows the separation of the apical and basolateral membranes and the maturation of cellâ€“cell junctions. The protein complex composed of PAR3, PAR6, and aPKC regulates apical polarity in several tissues, including the mammary epithelium, and it is known that the loss of PAR3 and aPKC interferes with mammary gland development and promotes mammary tumor metastasis. RAB11A, a protein that regulates intracellular trafficking, coordinates apical translocation of PAR3-PAR6-aPKC. Huntingtin (HTT), the protein mutated in Huntington disease, modulates RAB11A activity and also regulates the microtubule-based vesicular trafficking in neurons. Using MCF10A, MDCK 2-D and 3-D cell cultures, and mouse models, we demonstrate here that HTT coordinates the apical vesicular trafficking of PAR3-PAR6-aPKC through RAB11A. We show that loss of HTT in luminal cells alters apical polarity, tissue architecture and the maturation of luminal cells during pregnancy and lactation in the mouse. Together, these findings uncover HTT-mediated vesicular trafficking as a new pathway in the establishment of epithelial apical polarity, with potential implications for health and disease.
