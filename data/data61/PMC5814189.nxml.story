Gastric cancer is the fifth most common cancer and the third leading cause of cancer deaths worldwide. South Korea is in first place with 9,180 death alone attributed to gastric cancer in 2013. Plenty of literature suggests the evasion of apoptosis is implicated in neurodegeneration, autoimmune diseases, and tumors development due to dysregulation in the apoptotic mechanism. Reduced apoptosis or its resistance in cancer cells plays a significant role in carcinogenesis. Itâ€™s imperative to understand apoptosis, which provides the basis for novel targeted therapies that can induce cancer cell death or sensitize them to cytotoxic agents by regulating key factors like IAPs, MDM2, p53, caspases and much more. Studies have demonstrated that Scutellarein have the ability to inhibit several cancer cells by inducing apoptosis with both: Scutellarein monomers as well as scutellarein containing flavonoids. MTT results revealed that scutellarein inhibited cell viability in both dose and time dependent manner. Flow cytometry and western blot analysis showed that scutellarein induces apoptosis in both AGS and SNU-484 human gastric cancer cells and G2/M phase cell cycle arrest in SNU-484 cells. This study demonstrated that the Scutellarein on AGS and SNU-484 cells significantly inhibits cell proliferation and induces apoptotic cell death via down regulating MDM2 and activated the tumor suppresser protein p53, subsequently down regulating the IAP family proteins (cIAP1, cIAP2, and XIAP) leading to caspase-dependent apoptosis in AGS and SNU-484 cells.
