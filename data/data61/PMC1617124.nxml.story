 Health authorities worldwide recommend that pregnant women supplement their diet with folate (one of the B-vitamins), normally 0.4 mg per day. There is good evidence from systematic reviews of controlled trials that folate supplementation around conception and early in pregnancy is effective in protecting against neural tube (spine and brain) defects; continued supplementation throughout pregnancy reduces the chance of anemia in the mother. In many African countries, including Kenya, the dose of folate used is 5 mg per day, because this dose is more easily available there. In Kenya, as well as elsewhere in Africa, sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine is also given twice or more after the first trimester to treat and/or prevent malaria infection (which is more likely, and can have serious consequences, when a woman is pregnant). However, there is some evidence from laboratory experiments and clinical studies, none of which were done in pregnant women, suggesting that folate supplementation might reduce the effectiveness of sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine. Therefore, these researchers conducted a trial to test this hypothesis in 415 pregnant Kenyan women with malaria parasites in the blood but no severe symptoms. All were given standard sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine treatment. The women were randomized to receive either folate 5 mg daily, folate 0.4 mg daily, or placebo tablets for 14 days, after which all women reverted to the standard folate 5 mg tablets. The women were followed up for 28 days after the initial sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine dose and the principal outcome the researchers were interested in was the failure of sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine treatment, defined as fever and the presence of parasites in the blood (clinical failure) or the failure of parasites to clear from the blood or to reappear too soon (parasitological failure).
