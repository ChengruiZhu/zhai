As American health care undergoes great change, academic pathology is uniquely positioned to establish pathologists as key to the new health-care environment. Pathologists are at the forefront of major innovations in health care and are specialists who interact with all other medical specialists and essentially the entire range of health-care services. Academic pathologists benefit from being subspecialist experts who provide care to patients referred from large geographic areas, who can attain high academic stature over the course of their careers, and who serve as mentors for learners across virtually all medical specialties. Academic medical centers, in turn, have excellent credibility in the community, strong information technology infrastructure with the ability for data accrual and analysis not available in community health-care settings, and strong liaisons with civic authorities and policy makers. However, pathologists have to overcome their own tendencies toward modesty and lack of assertiveness, in order to help counter the significant trends in the health-care marketplace that disempower health-care providers and place health industry decision-making in the hands of nonmedical stakeholders. Specifically, academic pathologists need to proactively play a major role in institutional efforts to improve performance in quality, patient safety, efficiency, and coordinated care delivery and become leaders in the delivery of effective and efficient patient care. They need to play an essential role in utilization management, including molecular testing. They need to develop their value propositions for payers and seek to gain access to payers in order to represent these value statements. They should gain visibility directly to patients seeking expertise for second opinions and pursue opportunities for outreach programs in the community well beyond the academic medical center. Absent such efforts by academic pathologists, pathology is at risk of continued commoditization by nonpathologists, with weakening of the value proposition that pathology might bring forward.
