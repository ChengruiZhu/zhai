Among the 227 included patients, 18.5% (n = 42) were current smokers and 16.7% (n = 38) former smokers. Compared with nonsmokers, current smokers were younger, more often men, had less frequently hypertension, and cardioembolic etiology, whereas former smokers were more often men and had more frequently hypercholesterolemia. The rate of complete recanalization was 30% (n = 68) after IA rt-PA infusion and 49% after adjunctive thrombectomy. A higher complete recanalization rate was found both in current smokers (45.2%) and former smokers (42.1%) compared to nonsmokers (22.5%). After adjustment for potential confounders, the adjusted odds ratio (OR) for complete recanalization associated with ever-smokers was 2.51 [95% confidence interval (CI) 1.26-4.99; p = 0.009]. A similar adjusted OR was found when the complete recanalization achieved after thrombectomy was included (OR 2.18, 95% CI 1.13-4.19; p = 0.019). However, smoking status was not independently associated with favorable outcome (adjusted OR 1.41, 95% CI 0.62-3.22 for former smokers, and adjusted OR 1.35, 95% CI 0.59-3.05 for current smokers), 90-day all-cause mortality (adjusted OR 0.68, 95% CI 0.25-1.81 for former smokers, and adjusted OR 1.55, 95% CI 0.54-4.48 for current smokers) or intracerebral hemorrhage (adjusted OR 0.72, 95% CI 0.29-1.76 for former smokers, and adjusted OR 0.80, 95% CI 0.32-1.96 for current smokers).
