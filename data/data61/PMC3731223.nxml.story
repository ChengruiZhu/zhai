Double-strand breaks (DSBs) are critical DNA lesions because they can lead to cell death or, which is even more devastating, the formation of genomic rearrangements. Cells are equipped with two main pathways to repair such lesions, homologous recombination (HR) and non-homologous end-joining (NHEJ). HR is an error-free process and completely restores the genetic information, whereas NHEJ has the potential to form genomic rearrangements. We have previously shown that the structure of the chromatin is one important factor which determines the choice between these two pathways, such that DSBs localizing to highly condensed heterochromatic regions are mainly repaired by HR and breaks in more open euchromatic DNA undergo repair by NHEJ. Here, we investigate this aspect of DSB repair pathway choice. We show that DSB end-resection, which channels DSB repair into the process of HR, counteracts the profound local relaxation which initially takes place at the break site and reconstitutes the heterochromatic structure. Cells which are genetically modified, such that they cannot reconstitute the heterochromatic structure at resected DSBs, fail to employ HR and instead repair heterochromatic DSBs by alternative NHEJ mechanisms. Thus, chromatin modifications which occur during the process of end-resection prevent error-prone repair pathways from generating genomic rearrangements.
