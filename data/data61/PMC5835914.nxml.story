MicroRNA-32 (miR-32) is associated with tumor progression and poor prognosis in certain malignant tumors. However, the function and clinical relevance of miR-32 in human hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) has not yet been elucidated. The present study aimed to investigate the expression and prognostic value of miR-32 from liver samples in patients with HCC. The expression of miR-32 was analyzed in HCC and healthy tissues using Gene Expression Omnibus datasets. Reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction was used to analyze the levels of miR-32 mRNA in 154 HCC liver samples, 33 of which were paired with adjacent non-tumor tissues. The overall survival (OS) rate in patients with HCC was evaluated using Kaplan-Meier survival analysis, and the factors that may affect the prognosis and survival of patients with HCC were analyzed using univariate (log-rank test) and multivariate Cox proportional hazard models. The present results demonstrated that miR-32 expression levels were significantly upregulated in HCC liver biopsies compared with normal tissues (P<0.05). miR-32 expression was significantly associated with the number of foci and tumor diameter (P<0.05). In addition, Kaplan-Meier analysis revealed that patients with low miR-32 expression had longer OS and disease-free survival compared with those with high miR-32 expression (P<0.01). Altogether, to the best our knowledge, the present study is the first study to indicate the association between increased miR-32 expression with HCC progression and poor prognosis in patients. This suggests that miR-32 may have potential prognostic value and may be used as a tumor biomarker for the diagnosis of patients with HCC.
