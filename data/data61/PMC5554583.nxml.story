Noninvasive medical procedures are usually preferable to their invasive counterparts in the medical community. Anemia examining through the palpebral conjunctiva is a convenient noninvasive procedure. The procedure can be automated to reduce the medical cost. We propose an anemia examining approach by using a Kalman filter (KF) and a regression method. The traditional KF is often used in time-dependent applications. Here, we modified the traditional KF for the time-independent data in medical applications. We simply compute the mean value of the red component of the palpebral conjunctiva image as our recognition feature and use a penalty regression algorithm to find a nonlinear curve that best fits the data of feature values and the corresponding levels of hemoglobin (Hb) concentration. To evaluate the proposed approach and several relevant approaches, we propose a risk evaluation scheme, where the entire Hb spectrum is divided into high-risk, low-risk, and doubtful intervals for anemia. The doubtful interval contains the Hb threshold, say 11â€‰g/dL, separating anemia and nonanemia. A suspect sample is the sample falling in the doubtful interval. For the anemia screening purpose, we would like to have as less suspect samples as possible. The experimental results show that the modified KF reduces the number of suspect samples significantly for all the approaches considered here.
