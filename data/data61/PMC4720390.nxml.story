T cells, an essential component of the immune system, generate protective immune responses against pathogenic organisms and cancer cells. T cells are produced in the thymus, which provides a unique microenvironment required for T cell development. Distinct subsets of thymic epithelial cells (TECs) in the outer cortex and inner medulla provide signals required for the survival and differentiation of immature T cells, referred to as thymocytes. Medullary TECs (mTECs) play a critical role in preventing autoimmunity because they have the unique ability to express peptides found in other organs throughout the body. Presentation of self-peptides to thymocytes causes deletion of cells that express high affinity self-reactive receptors. Numerous studies have established that a major signaling pathway mediated by NFÎºB family members is indispensable for mTEC development. However, whether other signaling pathways are also required has remained an open question. Here, we use gain- and loss-of-function genetic approaches to demonstrate that another pathway, mediated by Stat3 signaling, plays an important role in mTEC development and homeostasis. We show that constitutive Stat3 activation enhances the survival of immature mTECs and bypasses the requirement for thymocyte-derived signals in medullary region formation. In contrast, Stat3 depletion reduces mTEC cellularity and impairs medullary region formation.
