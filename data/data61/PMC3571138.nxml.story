A data collection framework was designed to acquire data from a set of heterogeneous off-the-shelf sensor nodes including blood pressure monitors, blood glucose monitors, weight scales, pulse oximeters, and accelerometers, and transmit the data, through an Android phone, to a back-end server. Multivariate data imputation techniques were used to estimate any missing values in the continuously collected data. Statistical egression techniques were applied to the medical signals to identify statistically significant correlations between events of interest. A feature selection algorithm was developed to improve the regression methods. The system has been used in five clinical studies including three heart failure studies, a diabetes study, and a weight loss study. The system is currently used in a large clinical study with a total of 1500 heart failure patients are being recruited from six sites across California. In a smaller study in the past, we have recruited a total of 21 patients (10 men and 11 women; mean age 73.1±9.3, range 58–88) who completed a three-month intervention. A reference group of 21 patients (matched on age, gender, and race) was included in the preliminary analysis to provide a broad comparison group for studying patients. Baseline socio-demographic and clinical characteristics of the two groups were comparable. Both groups showed improvements in perceived health, HRQOL, and depression over time; however, anxiety increased in the comparison group. Patients assigned to the intervention group showed greater improvements in all six psychosocial factors over time.
