Several strategies for mapping ventricular outflow tract tachycardia have been reported as useful indices for differentiating between those originating from the right and the left side. Recently, tissue tracking imaging (TTI) has been demonstrated as a novel non-invasive modality for identifying the origin of outflow tract tachycardias. Tissue tracking imaging is an ultrasonographic technique that measures the myocardial motion amplitude towards the transducer in each region during systole, identifying regional myocardial displacement on the basis of myocardial velocities using color Doppler myocardial imaging principles. In this technique, the origin of the arrhythmia could be recognized as the site where the earliest color-coded signal (ECCS) appeared on the myocardium at the onset of the systole. In preliminary studies this modality was found to be useful in differentiating outflow tract ventricular tachycardias. ECCS was always found below or at the level of the pulmonary valve in all arrhythmias which could be ablated from the right ventricular outflow tract, while in those where the ECCS was above and close to the pulmonary valve it could be ablated from the left sinus of valsalva. These results indicate that TTI can provide detailed and accurate information on the arrhythmia origin of outflow tract tachycardia and may be useful for differentiating between an outflow tract tachycardia originating from the LV epicardium remote from the LSV and that from the LSV. Newer advances in echocardiographic technologies like high resolution, high frame rate real time three dimensional echocardiography with speckle tracking may further improve the precise localization of arrhythmias in the future.
