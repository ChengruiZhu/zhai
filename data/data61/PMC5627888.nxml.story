Trefoil factor 3 (TFF3) reconstructs the epithelial barrier by stimulating epithelial cell migration and proliferation, and significantly contributes to intestinal mucosal damage and healing. In a previous study, TFF3 was identified as a novel target of microRNA-7-5p (miR-7-5p). The aim of the present study was to investigate the roles and mechanisms of miR-7-5p in the proliferation and migration of intestinal epithelial cells. Reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) was performed to determine the expression level of miR-7-5p in the experimental groups. In addition, western blot analysis was performed to examine the expression levels of TFF3, phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K), Akt and phosphorylated (p)-AKT when miR-7-5p or TFF3 was overexpressed, and the effects of miR-7-5p and TFF3 on LS174T cell proliferation and migration were simultaneously investigated. miR-7-5p was demonstrated to decrease the expression level of TFF3, and inhibit LS174T cell proliferation and migration, which was accompanied by decreased expression levels of PI3K and p-Akt. miR-7-5p was decreased following combined treatment with the TFF3 plasmid and miR-7-5p mimics, compared with treatment with miR-7-5p mimics alone, which was accompanied by increased expression levels of TFF3, PI3K and p-Akt, and enhanced LS174T cell proliferation and migration effects. The expression levels of miR-7-5p in the miRNA negative control (NC) + LY294002 group, the miR-7-5p mimic + LY294002 group, and the miR-7-5p mimic + TFF3 plasmid + LY294002 group were higher than those in the NC group, the miR-7-5p mimic group and the miR-7-5p mimic + TFF3 plasmid group, respectively. Accordingly, the expression level of TFF3 was downregulated and the proliferation and migration ability of the cells was downregulated. The present study demonstrates that overexpressed miR-7-5p may inhibit the proliferation and migration of LS174T cells by targeting the expression of TFF3 via inhibiting the PI3K/Akt signalling pathway. The PI3K/Akt signalling pathway may exert a feedback regulation effect on miR-7-5p, inhibiting the activity of this signalling pathway, which increases the miR-7-5p expression levels and further enhances the effects of miR-7-5p on cell proliferation and migration.
