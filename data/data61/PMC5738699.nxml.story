Ubiquitin-like containing plant homeodomain and RING finger domains 1 (UHRF1) is an anti-apoptotic protein involved in the silencing of several tumor suppressor genes (TSGs) through epigenetic modifications including DNA methylation and histone post-translational alterations, and also epigenetic-independent mechanisms. UHRF1 overexpression is observed in a number of solid tumors and hematological malignancies, and is considered a primary mechanism in inhibiting apoptosis. UHRF1 exerts its inhibitory activity on TSGs by binding to functional domains and therefore influences several epigenetic actors including DNA methyltransferase, histone deacetylase 1, histone acetyltransferase Tat-interacting protein 60 and histone methyltransferases G9a and Suv39H1. UHRF1 is considered to control a large macromolecular protein complex termed epigenetic code replication machinery, in order to maintain epigenetic silencing of TSGs during cell division, thus enabling cancer cells to escape apoptosis. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are able to regulate the expression of its target gene by functioning as either an oncogene or a tumor suppressor. In the present review, the role of tumor suppressive miRNAs in the regulation of UHRF1, and the importance of targeting the microRNA/UHRF1 pathways in order to induce the reactivation of silenced TSGs and subsequent apoptosis are discussed.
