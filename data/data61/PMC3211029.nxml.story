The aim of the present study was to look into the possible protective effects of glycyrrhizic acid (GA) against isoproterenol-induced acute myocardial infarction in Sprague-Dawley rats. The effect of three doses of glycyrrhizic acid in response to isoproterenol (ISO)-induced changes in 8-isoprostane, lipid hydroperoxides, super oxide dismutase and total glutathione were evaluated. Male Sprague-Dawley rats were divided into control, ISO-control, glycyrrhizic acid alone (in three doses-5, 10 and 20 mg/kg BW) and ISO with glycyrrhizic acid (in three doses) groups. ISO was administered at 85 mg/kg BW at two consecutive days and glycyrrhizic acid was administered intraperitoneally for 14 days. There was a significant increase in 8-isoprostane (IP) and lipid hydroperoxide (LPO) level in ISO-control group. A significant decrease in total superoxide dismutase (SOD) and total glutathione (GSH) was seen with ISO-induced acute myocardial infarction. Treatment with GA significantly increased SOD and GSH levels and decreased myocardial LPO and IP levels. Histopathologically, severe myocardial necrosis and nuclear pyknosis and hypertrophy were seen in ISO-control group, which was significantly reduced with GA treatment. Gycyrrhizic acid treatment proved to be effective against isoproterenol-induced acute myocardial infarction in rats and GA acts as a powerful antioxidant and reduces the myocardial lipid hydroperoxide and 8-isoprostane level.
