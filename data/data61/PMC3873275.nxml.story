Oxygen deprivation plays a role in multiple human diseases ranging from heart attack, ischemic stroke, and traumatic injury. Aerobic organisms use oxygen to generate cellular energy in mitochondria; thus, oxygen deprivation results in energy depletion. Low oxygen can be catastrophic in tissues like the nervous system, which has high-energy demands and few glycolytic reserves. By contrast, other cells, including stem cells and cancerous cells within tumors, adapt and thrive in low oxygen. We are just beginning to understand how different organisms and even different cell types within the same organism respond to low oxygen conditions. The response of mitochondria to oxygen deprivation is particularly critical given their role in aerobic energy production. In addition, mitochondria actively injure cells during oxygen deprivation through the generation of reactive oxygen species, the disruption of calcium homeostasis, and the activation of cell death pathways. Here we use a genetic approach to show that mitochondria undergo fission during oxygen deprivation and refusion upon oxygen restoration. The hypoxia response pathway and the oxidative stress response pathway together modulate this response. We identify a new factor, stomatin-like protein, as a promoter of mitochondrial fusion in response to oxygen deprivation stress. Our findings uncover a new mechanism – regulated mitochondrial dynamics – by which cells adapt to oxygen deprivation stress.
