Dysferlin is a multi-C2 domain transmembrane protein involved in a plethora of cellular functions, most notably in skeletal muscle membrane repair, but also in myogenesis, cellular adhesion and intercellular calcium signaling. We previously showed that dysferlin interacts with alpha-tubulin and microtubules in muscle cells. Microtubules are heavily reorganized during myogenesis to sustain growth and elongation of the nascent muscle fiber. Microtubule function is regulated by post-translational modifications, such as acetylation of its alpha-tubulin subunit, which is modulated by the histone deacetylase 6 (HDAC6) enzyme. In this study, we identified HDAC6 as a novel dysferlin-binding partner. Dysferlin prevents HDAC6 from deacetylating alpha-tubulin by physically binding to both the enzyme, via its C2D domain, and to the substrate, alpha-tubulin, via its C2A and C2B domains. We further show that dysferlin expression promotes alpha-tubulin acetylation, as well as increased microtubule resistance to, and recovery from, Nocodazole- and cold-induced depolymerization. By selectively inhibiting HDAC6 using Tubastatin A, we demonstrate that myotube formation was impaired when alpha-tubulin was hyperacetylated early in the myogenic process; however, myotube elongation occurred when alpha-tubulin was hyperacetylated in myotubes. This study suggests a novel role for dysferlin in myogenesis and identifies HDAC6 as a novel dysferlin-interacting protein.
