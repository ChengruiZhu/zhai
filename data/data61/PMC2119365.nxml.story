Macrophage inflammatory protein-1 (MIP) is a recently cloned cytokine that causes neutrophilic infiltration and induces an inflammatory response. We studied the effect of MIP-1 alpha on histamine secretion from basophils and mast cells. Leukocytes from allergic and normal subjects were studied. MIP-1 alpha caused dose-dependent release of histamine from basophils of 14 of 20 allergic donors at concentrations of 10(-9)-10(-7) M, and the mean release was 13.50 +/- 2.9% at the highest concentration. In the same experiments, the mean histamine release by anti-immunoglobulin E and monocyte chemotactic and activating factor (MCAF) (10(-7) M) was 32 +/- 7% and 31 +/- 3%, respectively. The cells from only 2 of 10 normal subjects released histamine in response to MIP-1 alpha. Histamine release by MIP-1 alpha was rapid, and almost complete within the first 3 min. MIP-1 alpha- induced degranulation was a calcium-dependent noncytotoxic process. MIP- 1 alpha showed chemotactic activity for purified basophils that was comparable to MCAF. Both MIP-1 alpha and MCAF at 10(-7) M concentration elicited a chemotactic response that was 40% of the maximal response to C5a (1 microgram/ml). Murine MIP-1 alpha induced histamine release from mouse peritoneal mast cells in a dose-dependent manner. Thus, we have established that MIP-1 alpha is a novel activator of basophils and mast cells.
