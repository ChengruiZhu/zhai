Cerebral venous sinus thrombosis (CVST) is a relatively rare cerebrovascular disease, of which the risk has been documented in patients with numerous conditions. However, CVST has never been previously described in association with the use of a diagnostic curettage in patient with uterine fibroid. Herein, we described a 43-year-old woman who presented with recurrent convulsive seizures and severe and progressive headache 1 day after a diagnostic curettage of the uterus, which was confirmed to be uterine fibroid pathologically later, and her condition subsequently progressed to confusion. Brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed an acute extensive thrombosis of the left transverse and sigmoid sinus and the ipsilateral cerebellum infarction. Evaluation for primary thrombophilia revealed that an iron deficiency anemia (IDA) due to the fibroid bleeding induced menorrhagia together with a diagnostic curettage might be the sole hypercoagulable risk factor identified. Treatment with anticoagulation led to full recovery of her symptoms and recanalization of the thrombosis was proven on magnetic resonance venography (MRV) 2 months later. We suggest that CVST should be recognized as a potential complication related to this diagnostic technique, especially in patient with IDA. The early diagnosis and timely treatment would be of significance in improving the prognosis of this potentially lethal condition.
