 Antiretroviral drugs are used to treat patients with HIV infection, with good evidence that they improve prognosis. However, mutations develop in the HIV genome that allow it to evade successful treatment—known as drug resistance—and such mutations are known against every class of antiretroviral drug. Resistance can cause treatment failure and limit the treatment options available. Different types of tests are often used to detect resistance and to work out whether patients should switch to a different drug regimen. Currently, the different types of tests include genotype testing (direct sequencing of genes from virus samples infecting a patient); phenotype testing (a test that assesses the sensitivity of a patient's HIV sample to different drugs), and virtual phenotype testing (a way of interpreting genotype data that estimates the likely viral response to different drugs). The researchers of this study did a trial to find out whether providing an additional virtual phenotype report would be beneficial to patients, as compared with a genotype report alone. The main outcome was HIV viral load after 12 months of treatment, but the researchers also looked at differences in drug regimens prescribed, number of treatment changes in the study, and changes in CD4+ (the type of white blood cell infected by HIV) counts. The size of the trial (338 patients recruited) was large enough to properly test the hypothesis that providing a virtual phenotype report as well as a genotype report would result in lower HIV viral loads. Randomization of patients to either intervention ensured that the comparison groups were well-balanced, and the researchers also tested whether selection bias had affected the results (i.e., testing for the possibility that clinicians could predict which intervention participants would receive, and change recruitment into the trial as a result). They found no evidence for selection bias occurring within the trial. However, interpreting the results is difficult because the trial did not directly compare the two different testing platforms, but rather looked at whether providing a virtual phenotype report as well as a genotype report was better than providing a genotype report alone. The investigators also acknowledge that since the trial was conducted, the cutoffs for interpreting genotype information as resistant have been lowered. The findings may therefore not translate precisely to the current situation.
