Periodontal diagnosis and treatment plan are based on the assessment of probing depth, clinical attachment level, plaque index, gingival index, bleeding on probing, suppuration, furcation involvement, mobility, and radiographic findings. However, these clinical parameters are not sufficiently sensitive and specific to identify disease activity in individual sites or to predict future attachment loss. Hence, attention is focused on the development of diagnostic tools that could screen and differentiate the active inflamed sites and predict future tissue destruction. Gingival crevicular fluid (GCF), has gained great interest on possible diagnostic value in periodontal disease. It contains a large number of proteins and peptides derived from inflamed host tissues. The analysis of the GCF components can reflect the disease status of individual sites and thus, identify potential biomarkers of periodontitis. A literature search was carried out to find out all the available tests that indicate periodontal disease markers in GCF. All major databases were searched to compile the information on published reports between 1999 and 2014. The list of GCF-biomarkers available to date is compiled and presented in a table format. Based on the available literature on GCF biomarkers, it can be concluded that several sensitive and reliable markers are present to detect the presence, severity, and response to treatment. Further studies are warranted to analyze the sensitivity and reliability of these indicators which might help in developing noninvasive tests that could help in the diagnosis of periodontal disease.
