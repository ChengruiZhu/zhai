Cellular processes in eukaryotes are brought about through the contributions of large gene sets, and a continuing obstacle in studying these processes lies in the identification of critical constituent genes. The yeast pseudohyphal growth transition is an important example of a complex cellular growth transition. During pseudohyphal growth, yeast cells form connected chains or filaments, constituting a means of foraging for nutrients under conditions of nitrogen and/or glucose limitation. Yeast pseudohyphal growth has been studied for over two decades as a model of signaling systems controlling stress responses, cell shape, and fungal virulence. Hundreds of genes are required for pseudohyphal growth, however, and the critical genes that determine the filamentous phenotype have not been elucidated. Towards this goal, we implemented a genetic approach to identify alleles linked with the pseudohyphal growth phenotype. These studies identified previously unstudied variation in proteins functioning in a complex that controls cell polarity and in a protein of the mitochondrial inner membrane. This work indicates that proteins in complexes and organelles have coevolved within a given genome to yield distinct outputs and phenotype, while highlighting the application of an approach that is useful for the analysis of complex phenotypes in many eukaryotes.
