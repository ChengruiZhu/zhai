We have previously demonstrated that the murine humoral immune responses to the group-specific a and subtype-specific d/y determinants of hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) are controlled by H-2-linked immune response (Ir) genes. High responder (H-2d,q), intermediate responder (H-2a greater than b greater than k) and nonresponder (H- 2f,s) haplotypes have been identified (8, 9). The kinetics and specificity of in vivo antibody production after HBsAg immunization in congeneic, H-2-recombinant strains was analyzed to further define relevant Ir genes and their influence on the immune response to distinct antigenic determinants. These studies indicate that the humoral anti-HBs response is regulated by at least two Ir genes, one in the I-A subregion (Ir-HBs-1) and one in the I-C subregion (Ir-HBs-2) of the murine H-2 complex. Ir-HBs-1 regulates the primary responses to all HBsAg determinants, whereas the influence of Ir-HBs-2 is determinant specific, affecting the responses to the d or y determinants. The anti- a response is regulated exclusively by Ir-HBs-1. Strains possessing only the Ir-HBs-2 gene [B10.S(9R) and B10.HTT] produce no anti-a response and a subtype-specific antibody response is detected only after secondary or tertiary immunization. In contrast, the influence of Ir-HBs-2 in the presence of Ir-HBs-1 is detected upon primary immunization and is additive rather than exclusive. There is also suggestive evidence that the presence of the Ek molecule, at least in the context of I-Ak, may have a suppressive influence on the anti-HBs response. Additionally, HBsAg-specific, T cell proliferative responses were H-2 restricted and the kinetics and specificity of T cell proliferative responses paralleled in vivo antibody production. These data indicate that, although the I-A subregion exerts a dominant influence, distinct Ir-HBs genes, mapping in separate I subregions, control immune responses to alternate HBsAg determinants on the same protein molecule.
