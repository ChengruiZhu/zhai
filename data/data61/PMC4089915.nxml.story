Characterizing
large-scale structural transitions in biomolecular
systems poses major technical challenges to both experimental and
computational approaches. On the computational side, efficient sampling
of the configuration space along the transition pathway remains the
most daunting challenge. Recognizing this issue, we introduce a knowledge-based
computational approach toward describing large-scale conformational
transitions using (i) nonequilibrium, driven simulations combined
with work measurements and (ii) free energy calculations using empirically
optimized biasing protocols. The first part is based on designing
mechanistically relevant, system-specific reaction coordinates whose
usefulness and applicability in inducing the transition of interest
are examined using knowledge-based, qualitative assessments along
with nonequilirbrium work measurements which provide an empirical
framework for optimizing the biasing protocol. The second part employs
the optimized biasing protocol resulting from the first part to initiate
free energy calculations and characterize the transition quantitatively.
Using a biasing protocol fine-tuned to a particular transition not
only improves the accuracy of the resulting free energies but also
speeds up the convergence. The efficiency of the sampling will be
assessed by employing dimensionality reduction techniques to help
detect possible flaws and provide potential improvements in the design
of the biasing protocol. Structural transition of a membrane transporter
will be used as an example to illustrate the workings of the proposed
approach.
