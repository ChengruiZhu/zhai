Krebs von den Lungen-6 (KL-6), a mucinous sialylated sugar chain on human mucin-1 glycoprotein (MUC1), is a diagnostic marker for interstitial lung diseases. Furthermore, elevated serum KL-6 levels have been observed in certain malignant tumor types of epithelial origin. The expression of MUC1 has been observed in patients with epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) and is considered a potential therapeutic target. In the present study, KL-6 serum levels were investigated in patients clinically suspected of having malignant ovarian tumors. A total of 219 patients were enrolled in the study, which analyzed their serum KL-6 levels in addition to tumor expression of MUC1 using immunohistochemistry. High serum KL-6 levels were predominantly observed in patients with EOC, and did not occur in patients with benign or borderline tumors. The level of serum KL-6 was highly correlated with tumor stage, grade and histological type, and demonstrated superior sensitivity for the detection of ovarian cancer compared with that of serum cancer antigen 125. High serum KL-6 was significantly associated with shorter progression-free survival. In addition, tumor MUC1 expression status was significantly correlated with serum KL-6 levels. These data suggest that serum KL-6 may be a useful, non-invasive biomarker surrogate for tumor MUC1 expression in future clinical trials of MUC1-targeted therapy.
