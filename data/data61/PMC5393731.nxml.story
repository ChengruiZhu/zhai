Laser Eye Protection (LEP) devices selectively alter the spectral environment and affect the ability to identify and discriminate color. Pilots and mariners must wear LEP for their safety and still make decisions based on colored lights and objects. These abilities can be compromised with LEP. Determining the level of degradation caused by LEP remains challenging; LEP devices are not uniform in construction and results from laboratory tests may be poor indicators of actual user performance. In addition, performance deficits in the maritime and aviation environment can be exacerbated by cognitive distracters. However there is little known about the interaction of attentional effects with color performance deficits from the use of LEP. Several different mathematical models of color vision were utilized to model and predict color vision performance. Spectral reflectance or transmission was measured and placed into equations utilizing color matching functions of the standard observer. These values were then translated into different color spaces. These results were compared with actual performance. Results for modeling indicate that models that take into account color zone shifts, rather than color shifts are more accurate, and that models cannot yet account for all aspects of color vision performance such as when cognitively distracted.
