In the primary visual cortex of primates and carnivores, local visual stimulus features such as edge orientation are processed by neurons arranged in arrays of iso-orientation domains. Large-scale comparative studies have uncovered that the spatial layout of these domains and their topological defects follows species-invariant quantitative laws, predicted by models of large-scale circuit self-organization. Here, we ask whether the experimentally observed layout invariants might alternatively emerge as a consequence of random connectivity rules for feedforward projections from a small number of retinal cells to a much larger number of cortical target neurons. In this random wiring framework, the semi-regular and spatially granular arrangement of retinal ganglion cells determines the spatial layout of visual cortical iso-orientation domainsâ€”a hypothesis diametrically opposed to cortical large-scale circuit self-organization. Generalizing a prominent model of the early visual pathway, we find that the random wiring framework does not reproduce the experimentally determined layout invariants. Our results demonstrate how comparison between theory and quantitative phenomenological laws obtained from large-scale experimental data can successfully discriminate between competing hypotheses about the design principles of cortical circuits.
