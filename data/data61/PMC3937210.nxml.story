Evaluation of health-related quality of life (HRQoL) among people with diabetes has been growing in Iran over the last decade. The main aim of the current study was to systematically review the characteristics of these studies and examine quality of their findings. Persian (SID, Magiran) and English (Pubmed, Medline, Web of Science, CINAHL, Scopus, PsycINFO and ERIC) databases were systematically searched using the search terms: “diabetes” AND “quality of life” AND “Iran”. The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines were followed. A total of 46 studies passed the inclusion criteria and were included in the review. The included studies were conducted in 20 out of 30 provinces of the country. Most studies investigated HRQoL among people with type 2 diabetes. The Short Form Health Survey (SF-36) and WHO quality of life instruments (WHOQOL) were the main instruments used in these studies. Studies showed that people with diabetes had lower HRQoL than people without diabetes. Better socioeconomic status and better control of cardiovascular risk factors were associated with better HRQoL among the patients with diabetes. In general, the predictors of HRQoL among Iranian patients were similar to their international counterparts implying that diabetes patients share many common features. The reviewed studies suffer from major methodological and reporting flaws which limit validity and generalizability of their findings.
