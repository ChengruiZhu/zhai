As an integral component of the surgical staging system, lymphadenectomy for patients with endometrial cancer (EC) remains controversial, particularly in clinical stage I disease that includes not only low-risk, but also high-risk subgroups. In order to maximize the therapeutic effect of lymph node excision for high-risk patients who can potentially obtain survival benefits from it while minimizing its reverse effects in low-risk patients, pre-operative risk stratification of lymph node metastasis is necessary. The upregulation of microRNA-205 (miR-205) in carcinoma of the endometrium has been consistently reported recently and has been found to correlate with poor survival. The current study aimed to investigate whether the overexpression of miR-205 in curettage samples of EC could identify patients who are at a high risk for lymph node metastasis prior to surgery and validate the role of miR-205 as a prognostic marker in EC. Relative quantification detection of miR-205 in curettage and hysterectomy specimens of patients with EC was performed. Prediction of lymph node metastasis based on miR-205 expression, as well as tumor type and grade in curettage samples, was performed for all EC patients and patients with clinical stage I disease. Moreover, survival analysis was conducted. It was observed that miR-205 was significantly and consistently elevated in the curettage and hysterectomy samples of EC relative to normal controls. Furthermore, the overexpression of miR-205 could predict lymph node metastasis with a high accuracy and was revealed again to be associated with a poor prognosis in EC. Prospective and multicentric studies are required to further clarify the value of miR-205 as a promising predictor to stratify risk for lymph node metastasis in EC.
