Globally, Nigeria had the fourth highest incidence of tuberculosis (TB) cases in 2009. Datasets of the 2008 Nigeria Demographic and Health Survey (NDHS) were used for examining factors associated with respondentsâ€™ knowledge of and attitude towards TB in Nigeria. With the same age-group of males and females, the sample included 47,193 respondents aged 15-49 years. Factors associated with the knowledge of and attitude towards TB were examined against a set of individual-, household- and community-level variables, using multiple binary logistic regression analyses. Respondents who reported having ever heard of TB was 74.7%. Of those who ever heard of TB, 76.9% believed that TB can be cured, and 19.6% would want a family member's TB to be kept secret. Of those who ever heard of TB, 63.1% believed that TB was spread from person to person through the air by coughing or sneezing. Multivariate analysis indicated that the probability of having poor knowledge of and negative attitude towards TB was consistently significant among the poorest household (lowest wealth quintile), geopolitical regions (North Central), respondents with no schooling, non-working respondents, youngest age-group (15-19 years), and rural areas [adjusted odds ratios (AOR)=0.76, 95% CI 0.66-0.86 for respondents who had ever heard of TB; AOR=0.89, 95% CI 0.80-0.99 for respondents who had ever heard of TB and believed that TB can be cured; AOR=0.83, 95% CI 0.73-0.94 for those who had ever heard of TB and concealed the fact that a family member had TB; and AOR=0.88, 95% CI 0.78-0.99 for those who had ever heard of TB and believed TB was spread from person to person through the air by coughing or sneezing]. Efforts to improve the knowledge of and attitude towards TB in Nigeria should focus on the youngest age-group (15-19 years), the poorest households, and respondents with no schooling. Improving the knowledge and attitude of these groups of individuals may result in an increase in the number of people who will seek early treatment.
