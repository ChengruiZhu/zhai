Non-Hodgkin lymphoma often involves the liver. However, primary hepatic lymphoma (PHL) confined to the liver without evidence of lymphomatous involvement is rare. The optimal therapy for PHL is still unclear. Most patients present with poor prognostic features. Here, we report a case of PHL treated with liver resection followed by chemotherapy. A 65-year-old male was referred for further evaluation about a liver mass detected on ultrasound. Abdominal computed tomography (CT) scan showed well-defined single mass of 6 cm in diameter. Positron emission tomography/CT scan revealed a hot uptake lesion on the segment 8 of the liver. Colonoscopy showed no abnormal finding. It was diagnosed as intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma. A right anterior sectionectomy was performed. Postoperative pathology revealed diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. Bone marrow biopsy showed normal findings. The final diagnosis was confirmed as PHL. The patient subsequently received six cycles of R-CHOP (Rituximab, Cyclophosphamide, Doxorubicin, Vincristine, and Prednisolone) regimen. The patient is doing well without relapse after 60 months of follow-up. Because of its rarity and the lack of specific laboratory, radiological, or clinical finding, liver biopsy is essential for definite diagnosis of PHL. Optimal treatment for PHL is currently uncertain. However, surgical resection followed by adjuvant chemotherapy should be considered for select individuals to achieve better outcome.
