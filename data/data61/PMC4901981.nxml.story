Surgical procedures (e.g. endoprosthesis, cruciate ligament replacement) initiate physiological wound healing and the release of inflammatory mediators from platelets, damaged tissue and other cells of the immune system. Secreted cytokines such as transforming growth factor (TGF-beta 1) or platelet derived growth factor (PDGF) promote myofibroblast proliferation and differentiation. Mechanical strain (stretching exercises with pain inhibition) leads to activation of latent TGF-beta 1, which triggers scarring via ECM/XT synthesis and prevents myofibroblast apoptosis. Our recent study carried out a decreased platelet count in arthrofibrosis patients compared to healthy controls. Thus, an elevated platelet consumption might take place. Analogous to TGF-beta 1, PDGF also inhibits myofibroblast apoptosis and expression of matrix metalloproteinase expression, which degrade ECM. Emotional stress might not only matter in other fibrotic diseases e.g. tako-tsubo cardiomyopathy (TTC) but also in arthrofibrosis. Sympathicotonic destabilization (due to pain, frustration or social burden) results in increased catecholamine synthesis and sympathetic activity. These effects are recognizable by vegetative symptoms (e.g. insomnia, sweating, muscle tension). Catecholamines directly activate fibroblasts and increase ECM synthesis by binding to Beta 2-adrenergic receptors. In TTC, a decrease in catecholamines and profibrotic cytokines restores organ functionality.
