Identification of prognostic molecular markers of breast cancer is extremely important. The spreading out of the primary breast tumour cells to the lymphatic system is at the forefront of symbolising the first signs of distant organ metastasis. Deregulated genes in breast cancer tissues that spread to lymph nodes may show early predictive molecular markers. In the present study, we selected five microRNAs, which play a key function in the invasion-metastasis cascade. We investigated the levels of microRNAs in 80 paired samples of BC and matched adjoining tissues, and we examined the potential relationships between microRNA levels and positive lymph node status. Our results attest that three microRNAs (miR-21, miR-155, miR-222) were significantly up-regulated, whilst miR-205 was substantially down-regulated in BC tissues in relation to normal adjoining tissues in a heterogeneous patient cohort. The high levels of two microRNAs, miR-155 and miR-222, showed a statistical relation with the positive lymph node status, especially in patients that had triple negative BC. Conversely, miR-155 was substantially down-regulated in tumour tissues of patients who received preoperative neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) compared with tumour tissues of patients without NAC in cohorts sub-classified to lymph node positive status. Our findings show evidence that the miR-155 and the miR-222 can be defined as molecular markers in regards to cancer patients to prognosticate spread to the lymph node. They also showed that the miR-155 could have crucial significances in BC treatment.
