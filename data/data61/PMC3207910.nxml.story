Primary cilia are considered to be a signaling hub coordinating multiple signaling pathways. Impairment of ciliary function results in developmental defects in vertebrates and also underlies many human disorders including obesity, polycystic kidney disease, and retinopathy. BBS is a prototypical human genetic disorder associated with ciliary dysfunction. Among the known BBS proteins, seven form a complex, the BBSome, which was recently defined as a coat complex transporting membrane proteins between plasma and ciliary membranes. However, the molecular mechanisms controlling BBSome trafficking and the cargos transported by the BBSome are not well understood. In this work, we performed tandem affinity purification using transgenic mice expressing one of the BBSome subunits and identified a novel protein, LZTFL1, as a BBSome interacting protein. We determined that LZTLF1 negatively regulates BBSome ciliary trafficking and that reduction of LZTFL1 activity can compensate for loss of certain BBS proteins and restores BBSome ciliary trafficking. Furthermore, we discovered that BBSome and LZTFL1 regulate ciliary trafficking of Smoothened, a 7-transmembrane Hedgehog signal transducer. Our findings identify an important player in cilia biology and provide novel insights into the regulation of Hedgehog signaling, a crucial signaling pathway for organizing the body plan, organogenesis, and tumorigenesis.
