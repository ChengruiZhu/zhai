Endothelial cells are highly active, sensing and responding to signals from extracellular environments. They act as gatekeepers, mediating the recruitment and extravasation of proinflammatory leukocytes to the sites of tissue damage or infection. Endothelial cells participate in fibrinolysis by secreting tissue-type plasminogen activator, which converts plasminogen to active enzyme plasmin through constitutive and regulated pathways. Fibrinolysis systems and inflammation are tightly linked, as both responses are major host defense systems against both healing processes of tissue repair as well as pathogenic microorganisms. Endothelial cell dysfunction is one of the early signs of systemic inflammation, and it is a trigger of multiple organ failure in sepsis. The marked increase in plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 level causes fibrinolytic shutdown in endotoxemia or sepsis and is one of the most important predictors of multiple organ dysfunction during sepsis-induced disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). Leukocytes exhibit the first-line response to microorganisms. Leukocyte-derived elastase degrades cross-linked fibrin to yield molecular species distinct from those generated by plasmin. The alternative systems for fibrinolysis that interact with the plasminogen activator-plasmin systems may play crucial roles in the lysis of fibrin clots in sepsis-induced DIC.
