A likely key factor in the failure of a HIV-1 vaccine based on cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL) is the natural immunodominance of epitopes that fall in variable regions of the proteome, which both increases the chance of epitope sequence mismatch with the incoming challenge strain and replicates the pathogenesis of early CTL failure due to epitope escape mutation during natural infection. To identify potential vaccine sequences to focus the CTL response on highly conserved epitopes, the whole proteomes of HIV-1 clades A1, B, C, and D were assessed for Shannon entropy at each amino acid position. Highly conserved regions in Gag (cGag-1, Gag 148–214, and cGag-2, Gag 253–331), Env (cEnv, Env 521–606), and Nef (cNef, Nef 106–148) were identified across clades. Inter- and intra-clade variability of amino acids within the regions tended to overlap, suggesting that polyvalent representation of consensus sequences for the four clades would allow broad HIV-1 strain representation. These four conserved regions were rich in both known and predicted CTL epitopes presented by a breadth of HLA types, and screening of 54 persons with chronic HIV-1 infection revealed that these regions are commonly immunogenic in the context of natural infection. These data suggest that vaccine delivery of a 16-valent mixture of these regions could focus the CTL response against conserved epitopes that are broadly representative of circulating HIV-1 strains.
