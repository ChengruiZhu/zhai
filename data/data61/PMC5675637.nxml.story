Progestin-primed ovarian stimulation (PPOS) protocol has recently been demonstrated to be an novel regimen for preventing premature LH surges during controlled ovarian hyperstimulation (COH) in combination with frozen-thawed embryo transfer (FET). Our prospective controlled study was to explore the effect of human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) contained in human menopausal gonadotropin (hMG) on the clinical outcomes in normalovulatory women undergoing COH with PPOS. A total of 180 patients were allocated into three groups according to the gonadotropin (Gn) used: group A (human menopausal gonadotropin, hMG-A), group B (hMG-B) or group C (follicle stimulating hormone, FSH). The primary outcome measured was the number of oocytes retrieved. The number of oocytes retrieved in group A B C was 10.72±5.78 11.33±5.19and13.38±8.97, respectively, with no statistic significance (p>0.05). Other embryological indicators were also similar (p>0.05). The concentration of serum and urinary β-hCG on the trigger day in group A and B were not associated with embryo results (p>0.05). There was no significant differences in the clinical pregnancy rate (41.67% vs. 51.56% vs. 39.51%, p>0.05) and implantation rate (31.58%vs. 34.75%vs.25.33%) after FET among the three groups. Thus the clinical characteristics were not affected by the hCG contained in hMG in normalovulatory women treated with PPOS.
