Although percutaneous renal biopsy remains the preferred method, there are several scenarios where transjugular approach is more suitable. We hereby describe our technique of transjugular renal biopsy (TJRB) and evaluate its safety and efficacy. We retrospectively collected data regarding indication for the transjugular route of biopsy, its complications, clinical and laboratory data, and adequacy of samples from patients' records. TJRB was performed when the patients were at a high risk for bleeding from percutaneous renal biopsy. Tissue samples were assessed by a pathologist for adequacy. All patients were followed up with ultrasonographic scan 3 h after the procedure and on day 3. Nine patients (age 41.5 ± 15.4 years; 8 men) underwent 9 TJRB procedures. The procedure was technically successful in all patients. Six patients (66.67%) had a platelet count of <50,000/mcL, 2 (33.3%) had an elevated International Normalized Ratio of more than 1.4, and 1 had both. 3.2 ± 0.4 cores were obtained, with median (range) number of glomeruli being ten (7–11). Adequate renal tissue sample was obtained in all the patients. Though capsular perforation developed in 5 patients, none had major complication requiring management (endovascular treatment or blood transfusion). TJRB is a safe and effective in patients with contraindications to percutaneous biopsy.
