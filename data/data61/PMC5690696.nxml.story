Here we present modelling of the glucocorticoid receptor (GR) signalling network. The GR is the effector for a class of drugs known as corticosteroids, which are widely used in medicine for their anti-inflammatory effects and ability to induce apoptosis in leukaemic cells. However, side effects, treatment-related toxicity and glucocorticoid resistance remain and therefore increased understanding of the glucocorticoid receptor mechanism of action may improve therapeutic outcomes. The GEB052 model presented herein has been used to generate predictions for how the network is altered between glucocorticoid-sensitive and glucocorticoid-resistant scenarios, and these predictions have been verified using published gene expression data from established cell lines (for both qualitative and semi-quantitative analysis). The model has also been preliminarily assessed as a predictive clinical tool by correlating model predictions with clinical outcomes of thirteen leukaemia patients. Thus, the GEB052 model demonstrates successful modelling to understand GR function. GEB052 provides accurate predictions and has indicated potential routes through which glucocorticoid resistance may arise. The work presented herein thus demonstrates a proof-of-principle of this modelling approach to furthering GR research, and provides insight into potential mechanisms of corticosteroids resistance.
