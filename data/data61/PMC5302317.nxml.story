Peroxiredoxins (Prxs) are a large, ubiquitous superfamily of proteins that are arguably the most important reductants of peroxide in biological systems. These proteins are involved in a diverse array of essential cellular functions, including peroxide reduction, signal transduction, circadian rhythms, chaperone function and apoptosis. Previously, Prxs have been classified multiple ways, based on biological role and evolutionary analysis. A more detailed expertly curated analysis identified six functionally relevant Prx classes and identified over 3500 proteins in these six classes; this set provides a validation for molecular function annotation methods. It is well-known that automated molecular functional annotation for individual protein sequences is difficult without detailed manual curation. In this work, we address this deficiency in available technologies by presenting a novel iterative method, MISST, for agglomeratively identifying superfamily members and clustering them into functionally relevant groups. Using this potentially automatable approach, 38,739 Prx sequences were identified from GenBank. MISST identified six functionally relevant clusters from these sequences, matching those previously identified by experts. Key mechanistic determinants and organismal distribution are explored. This analysis provides a significantly more complete understanding of this biologically important protein superfamily; the method lays a foundation for automated functionally relevant clustering of the protein universe.
