Acupuncture can affect bone healing by stimulation of sensory nerves and releasing of local and systemic neuropeptides. The purpose of this experimental study was to evaluate the effects of electroacupuncture on ulna fracture healing in dogs. In this study, 12 healthy dogs were randomly divided in to four equal groups, where group 1 was kept as control group and evaluated for 45 days, group 2: treatment group and evaluated for 45 days, group3: control group of 90 days and group 4: treatment group of 90 days. After induction of anesthesia, the ulna was cut with Gigli wire saw in each groups, 10 days after operation, the treatment (acupuncture) group was treated with 10 minutes electroacupuncture stimulations on the acupoints Kid1, Kid3, Kid6 and Kid7, for 10 days. Histopathologic samples of all dogs were harvested from bone osteotomized site in 45 and 90 days after surgery. Indices like, count of inflammatory cells, cartilaginous tissue, fibrotic tissue and deposition of collagen were evaluated on samples and classified with 0, 1, 2, and 3 degrees. Also, radiographic evaluation of the patients was applied using radiographic scoring system on days: 7, 15, 30, 45, 60 and 90 after surgery. This study revealed that, acupuncture had no effect on bone healing (p>0.05). Cause of non-significant difference changes between the control and treatment groups, and lack of complete healing in both groups may be due to lack of ulna bone fixation. Alternatively, selection of other acupoints in acupuncture could have a better healing role.
