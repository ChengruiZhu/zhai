The aim of this study is to present the five-year longitudinal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) follow up of a patient with incidental finding of near-obstruction stenosis of the aqueduct of Sylvius due to a large pineal cyst. The patient was scanned 3 times on a 3T MR device using a set of standard structural sequences supplemented with high-resolution constructive interference of steady state (CISS) T2 sequence for precise delineation of the aqueduct of Sylvius and cardiac-gated phase-contrast sequences for the analysis of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) movement. On all MR scans, the size of the pineal cyst and severity of near-obstruction aqueductal stenosis did not show any morphological changes. There was no significant ventricular enlargement although structural CISS sequence showed a near-obstruction stenosis and cardiac-gated phase-contrast sequences did not detect CSF movement through the aqueduct of Sylvius. Our findings are contradictory to the classic hypothesis of CSF physiology based on secretion, circulation, and absorption of CSF, which states that the impairment of CSF circulation through the aqueduct of Sylvius inevitably leads to a hypertensive hydrocephalus development involving the third and the lateral ventricle. Our research group previously proposed a new hypothesis of CSF physiology, which offers more suitable explanation for such clinical cases.
