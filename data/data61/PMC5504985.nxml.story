The aim of the present study was to characterize the phenotypic shift, quantity and role changes in different subgroups of retinal macrophages in a mouse model of oxygen-induced retinopathy (OIR). The mRNA expression levels of macrophage M1 and M2 subgroup marker genes and polarization-associated genes were analyzed by RT-qPCR. The number of M1 and M2 macrophages in our mouse model of OIR was analyzed by flow cytometry at different time points during the progression of OIR. Immunofluorescence whole mount staining of the retinas of mice with OIR was performed at different time points to examine the influx of macrophages, as well as the morphological characteristics and roles of M1 and M2 macrophages. An increased number of macrophages was recruited during the progression of angiogenesis in the retinas of mice with OIR due to the pro-inflammatory microenvironment containing high levels of cell adhesion and leukocyte transendothelial migration molecules. RT-qPCR and flow cytometric analysis at different time points revealed a decline in the number of M1 cells from a significantly high level at post-natal day (P)13 to a relatively normal level at P21, as well as an increase in the number of M2 cells from P13 to P21 in the mice with OIR, implicating a shift of macrophage polarization towards the M2 subtype. Immunofluorescence staining suggested that the M1 cells interacted with endothelial tip cells at the vascular front, while M2 cells embraced the emerging vessels and bridged the neighboring vessel sprouts. Thus, our data indicate that macrophages play an active role in OIR by contributing to the different steps of neovascularization. Our findings indicate that tissue macrophages may be considered as a potential target for the anti-angiogenic therapy of ocular neovascularization disease.
