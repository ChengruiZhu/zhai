Multidrug resistance (MDR) against chemotherapeutic agents has become one of the major obstacles to successful cancer therapy and MDR-associated proteins (MRPs)-mediated drug efflux is the key factor for MDR. In this study, a redox-responsive polymer based on dextran (DEX) and indomethacin (IND), which could reduce MRPs-mediated efflux of chemotherapeutics, was synthesized, and the obtained polymer could spontaneously form stable micelles with well-defined core-shell structure and a uniform size distribution with an average diameter of 50 nm and effectively encapsulate doxorubicin (DOX); the micelles contain a disulfide bridge (cystamine, SS) between IND and DEX (DEX-SS-IND). In vitro drug release results indicated that DEX-SS-IND/DOX micelles could maintain good stability in a stimulated normal physiological environment and promptly depolymerized and released DOX in a reducing environment. After incubating DEX-SS-IND/DOX micelles with drug-resistant tumor (MCF-7/ADR) cells, the intracellular accumulation and retention of DOX were significantly increased under the synergistic effects of redox-responsive delivery and the inhibitory effect of IND on MRPs. In vitro cytotoxicity showed that DEX-SS-IND/DOX micelles exhibited higher cytotoxicity against MCF-7/ADR cells. Moreover, DEX-SS-IND/DOX micelles showed significantly enhanced inhibition of tumor in BALB/c nude mice bearing MCF-7/ADR tumors and reduced systemic toxicity. Overall, the cumulative evidence indicates that DEX-SS-IND/DOX micelles hold significant promise for overcoming MDR for cancer therapy.
