Kersa HDSS was established in 12 sub-districts of Kersa district, Eastern Hararge, Oromia Region, Ethiopia. The site is principally rural with two small towns (Kersa and Weter). The baseline census was conducted in 2007 and since then has been updated every 6 months, with registration of demographic and health events. Data are entered into the HRS-2 relational database. At baseline a total of 10 085 houses, 10 522 households and 50 830 people were registered. The sex ratio and number of persons per household were 1.0 and 5.1, respectively. At the end of 2013, the population was 60 694. Up to the end of 2013, 12 571 births and 3143 deaths were registered, respectively. Over 85% of births and deaths occurred at home. The annual net population growth ranges from 0.06 to 1.6. The majority of the population in Kersa are not working age group; hence the dependency ratio in most of the years is below 1. The total fertility rate ranges from 4.0 to 5.3. A reduction in neonatal, infant and under-five mortalities was observed. For all deaths, verbal autopsies were done. Tuberculosis is the leading cause of death among adults and malnutrition is the leading cause of death among children aged under 5 years. Kersa HDSS is ready to collaborate with interested researchers on health and demographic issues. For further details please visit: [
