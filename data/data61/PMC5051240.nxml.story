Advances in oncologic therapies have allowed many patients with breast cancer to achieve better outcomes and longer survival. However, this progress has been tempered by cardiotoxicity, associated with anticancer therapies, ranging from subclinical abnormalities to irreversible life-threatening complications, such as congestive heart failure or cardiomyopathy. In particular, exposure to chemotherapy (CHT), including anthracyclines and trastuzumab, can lead to cardiac dysfunction with short- or long-term consequences, among patients with breast cancer. The aim of this study is to highlight the potential role of commonly used cardiac medications in the prevention of anthracycline- and trastuzumab-mediated cardiotoxicity, in women with breast cancer, based on evidence from recent clinical trials. This overview is focused on the use of antihypertensive medications, such as angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers, outlining their cardioprotective effects in this patient population. In addition, the importance of biomarkers and modern imaging tests, as potential tools for detection and monitoring of cardiac dysfunction, induced by CHT, as well as some practical preventive and therapeutic strategies for cardio-oncology treatment teams, involved in the management of a growing number of women with breast cancer have been outlined. The content of this overview is based on a literature search of PubMed, within the last 5 years, mostly in relevance to the human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-positive patients with breast cancer, treated with anthracycline or trastuzumab therapy (in addition to surgery and/or radiation therapy [RT] regimen).
