There were 97,511 COPD-related ED visits made by adults age 45 and older in NC in 2008–2009, made by 64,568 individuals. HOSPITAL ADMISSIONS: Nearly half (46.3%) of all COPD-related ED visits resulted in hospital admission. Hospitalization prevalence increased with age, but there were no differences by gender. ED visits that were non-insured (self-pay) or paid by Medicare or Medicaid were less likely to lead to hospitalization than those with private insurance. RETURN VISITS: 1.6% (1607) of the COPD-related ED visits were categorized as 3-day return visits and 11.2% (10922) were considered 30-day return visits. There were no statistical differences by gender for 3-day returns, while 30-day returns were more likely to be made by men. Prevalence of return visits for both intervals initially increased with age compared to the 45–49 years age group, then decreased steadily after age 65. Visits that were non-insured or paid by Medicare or Medicaid were statistically more likely to be 3-day or 30-day returns than those paid by private insurance. DISPOSITION PATTERNS: We also examined the permutations of 1st and 2nd ED visit dispositions that make up these return visit pairs. While many return visits were discharged at both visits in the return visit pair, a substantial proportion were admitted at one or both visits. Surprisingly, in 8% of the 3-day return visit pairs, the patient was hospitalized at the 1st ED visit but yet still returned to the ED within 3 days; for the 30-day visit pairs, 37% returned despite the patient being admitted at the 1st visit.
