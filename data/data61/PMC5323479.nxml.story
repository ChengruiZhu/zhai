The aim of the present study was to calculate non-medical costs during year 1 after diagnosis in two cohorts of patients with early rheumatoid arthritis enrolled 1996–1998 and 2006–2009. Clinical data were collected regularly in both cohorts. Besides information about healthcare utilization and days lost from work, patients reported non-medical costs for aids/devices, transportation, formal and informal care. Formal care was valued as full labour cost for official home help (€42.80/h) and informal care from relatives and friends as opportunity cost of leisure time, corresponding to 35% of labour cost (€15/h). In both cohorts, only 2% used formal care, while more than 50% used informal care. Prescription of aids/devices was more frequent in cohort 2 and more women than men needed aids/devices. Help with transportation was also more common in cohort 2. Women in both cohorts needed more informal care than men, especially with personal care and household issues. Adjusting for covariates in regression models, female sex remained associated with higher costs in both cohorts. Non-medical costs in cohort 2 were €1892, €1575 constituting informal care, corresponding to 83% of non-medical costs. Total non-medical costs constituted 25% of total direct costs and 11% of total direct and indirect costs. Informal care accounted for the largest part of non-medical costs and women had higher costs than men. Despite established social welfare system, it is obvious that family and friends, to a large extent, are involved in informal care of patients with early RA, and this may underestimate the total burden of the disease.
