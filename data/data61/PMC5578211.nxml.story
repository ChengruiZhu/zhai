 integrin and blocks T-cell migration into intestinal mucosa. We aimed to investigate chemokine levels in serum of IBD-patients treated with vedolizumab. In this pilot study, we included 11 IBD patients (8 Crohnâ€™s disease, 3 ulcerative colitis) previously non-respondent to anti-tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-agents. Patients received vedolizumab at week 0, 2 and 6 and were evaluated for clinical efficacy at week 10. Clinical characteristics and routine laboratory parameters were obtained and patients were classified as responders or non-responders. Expression of 21 chemokines in serum was measured using Proximity Extension Assay and related to clinical outcome. At week 10, 6 out of 11 patients had clinically responded. Overall expression of CCL13 increased after treatment. In non-responders, expression of CCL13 and CXCL8 increased after treatment, and CCL20 and CXCL1 expressions were higher compared to responders. In responders, CCL28 decreased after treatment. C-reactive protein (CRP) correlated negatively with 6 chemokines before therapy, but not after therapy. Systemic CCL13 expression increases in IBD-patients after vedolizumab therapy and several chemokine levels differ between responders and non-responders. An increased CCL13-level when starting vedolizumab treatment, might indicate potential prognostic value of measuring chemokine levels when starting therapy with vedolizumab. This study provides new information on modulation of systemic chemokine levels after vedolizumab treatment.
