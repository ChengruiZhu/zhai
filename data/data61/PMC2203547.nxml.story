 Frequency characteristics of various retinal neurons in the carp were studied using sinusoidally modulated light as an input. They were affected by both intensity and pattern of illumination. In the horizontal cells, in which the effect of light intensity was studied most extensively, an increase in the light intensity brought about a decrease of the gain, which was more marked at lower frequencies, resulting in a shift of cutoff frequency towards higher frequencies and in a slight low frequency attenuation. A decrease in the area illuminated had an effect similar to a decrease in the light intensity. In the receptor, the low frequency attenuation was not apparent even at high light intensities. The adaptation process in receptors was not sufficient to explain the low frequency attenuation in the horizontal cells, and a possible contribution of negative feedback from horizontal cells to receptors was suggested. In the bipolar cell, the lateral interaction played an important role. An increase in an area resulted in the suppression of the response at low frequencies where the phases of the center and the surround responses were opposed, but in the augmentation near 5 Hz where the two responses were in phase. In amacrine cells, a low frequency attenuation and a phase advance at low frequencies were very prominent, and were considered to be due mainly to a process designated here as the neural adaptation.
