Of 3,284 hits, 165 studies (one meta-analysis, 15 systematic reviews, 31 randomized controlled trials, 65 cohort studies, 12 case-control studies and 41 cross-sectional studies) were included and evaluated. Recommendations on the following remain largely unaltered: full breastfeeding for 4 months as a means of allergy prevention (hypoallergenic infant formula in the case of infants at risk); avoidance of overweight; fish consumption (during pregnancy/lactation and in the introduction of solid foods for infants); vaccination according to the recommendations of the German Standing Committee on Vaccination (St√§ndige Impfkommission, STIKO); avoidance of air pollutants and tobacco exposure and avoidance of indoor conditions conducive to the development of mold. The assertion that a reduction in house-dust mite allergen content as a primary preventive measure is not recommended also remains unchanged. The introduction of solid foods into infant diet should not be delayed. In the case of children at risk cats should not be acquired as domestic pets. Keeping dogs is not associated with an increased risk of allergy. The updated guideline includes a new recommendation to consider the increased risk of asthma following delivery by cesarean section. Additional statements have been formulated on pre- and probiotic agents, psychosocial factors, medications, and various nutritional components.
