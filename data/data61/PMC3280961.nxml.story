The world's largest carnivorous marsupial, the Tasmanian devil, is threatened with extinction due to the emergence of devil facial tumour disease (DFTD), a fatal transmissible tumour. Critical loss of genetic diversity has rendered the devil vulnerable to transmission of tumour cells by grafting or transplanting the cells while biting and jaw wrestling. Initial studies of DFTD tumours revealed rearrangements among tumour chromosomes, with several missing chromosomes and four additional marker chromosomes of unknown origin. Since then, new strains of the disease have emerged and appear to be derived from the original strain. With no prior information available regarding the location of genes on normal devil chromosomes, a necessary first step towards characterisation of chromosome rearrangements in DFTD was to construct a map of the normal devil genome. This enabled us to elucidate the chromosome rearrangements in three DFTD strains. In doing so we determined the origin of the marker chromosomes and compared the three strains to determine which areas of the genome are involved in ongoing tumour evolution. Interestingly, rearrangements between strains are limited to particular genomic regions, demonstrating the unusual stability of this unique cancer. This study is therefore an important first step towards understanding the genetics of DFTD.
