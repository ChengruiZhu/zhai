 promoters, regulates expression of two genes instead of one. These promoters are situated between two adjacent genes whose transcription start sites are physically within 1,000 bp and oriented in opposite directions. Bidirectional promoters are found repeatedly in the genome, suggesting an important biological significance for this regulatory configuration. We developed an algorithm to map bidirectional promoters using data from a comprehensive list of transcribed sequences known as expressed sequence tags, or ESTs. This approach improved the number of previously characterized bidirectional promoters by 300%. Included in the new data are bidirectional promoters that regulate expression of genes implicated in somatic cancers. For instance, ten well-recognized genes implicated in breast and ovarian cancers were identified as having bidirectional promoters. Three of the genes are further related by having duplicate copies of the same binding site for a transcription factor within their bidirectional promoters. These binding sites are conserved among species, providing greater evidence that they are functionally important. This example, in which similar regulatory structures are used to control genes involved in cancer, illustrates how data can be mined from the comprehensive set of bidirectional promoters. Within this manuscript, we show statistical evidence that many cancer genes are regulated by bidirectional promoters. These promoters will be a valuable dataset for studying the role of gene regulation in tumor development.
