 intermodal cell is formed by a division of the segment cell, the latter being a direct derivative of the shoot apical cell. The internodal cell is remarkable in that it elongates from an initial length of about 20 microns to a mature length of about 60 millimeters. The structures of the apical and segment cells, and the internodal cells in all stages of development were examined with the techniques of interference, polarization, and electron microscopy. The apical and segment cells were found to be isotropic. The upper part of the segment cell, destined to form a node, shows a curious pitted structure that was characteristic of certain node structures. The lower part of the segment cell, destined to become an internodal cell, shows a vague transverse arrangement of fibrils at the inner wall surface. The internodal cells, from the time they are first formed, show negative birefringence and a transverse arrangement of microfibrils at the inner wall surface. The elongation of the internodal cell is characterized by a rise, dip, and rise in both the optical thickness and retardation of the cell wall. The dip in both these variables coincides with the attainment of the maximum relative elongation rate. After the cessation of elongation, wall deposition continues, but the fibrils at .the inner surface of the wall are now seen to occur in fields of nearly parallel microfibrils. These fields, with varying fibrillar directions, may partly overlap each other or may merge with one another. Unlike the growing wall, this wall which is deposited after the end of elongation is isotropic.
