Behçet’s disease (BD) is a complex, multisystemic inflammatory disorder of unclear etiology. Single nucleotide polymorphisms in tumor necrosis factor (TNF) and interleukin (IL)-10 genes have been implicated in susceptibility to BD with inconsistent results in several ethnic populations. The aim of this case-control study was to evaluate the association of TNF-α (−308G/A), TNF-β (+252A/G), and IL-10 (−1082G/A, −819C/T, and −592 C/A) polymorphisms with susceptibility of BD in Saudi patients. Molecular genotyping of TNF-α, TNF-β, and IL-10 gene polymorphisms was performed to analyze the alleles and genotypes distribution in 272 Saudi subjects, including BD patients (61) and healthy controls (211). The frequencies of allele A and genotype GA of TNF-α (−308G/A) were significantly higher, whereas those of allele G and genotypes GG were significantly lower in BD patients than controls, indicating that A allele and GA genotype are susceptible, while G allele and GG genotype may be refractory to BD. The distribution of frequencies of alleles and genotype of TNF-β (+252A/G) promoter polymorphism was not significantly different between BD patients and healthy controls. Genotypes 1082GG, −819TT, and 592AA of IL-10 polymorphisms are significantly associated with susceptibility risk of BD, while genotypes 1082AA, 1082GA, 819CC, 819CT, 592CC, and 592CA are resistant to BD. This study indicates that TNF-α (−308G/A) and IL-10 (−1082G/A, −819C/T, and −592C/A) polymorphisms are associated with risk of BD susceptibility in Saudi patients. However, larger scale studies in Saudi population as well as in other ethnicities are needed to confirm this association.
