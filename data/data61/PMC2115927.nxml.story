Before addition of cAMP, Dictyostelum amoebae rapidly translocating in buffer are elongate, exhibit expansion zones primarily at the anterior end and filamentous actin (F-actin) localization primarily in the anterior pseudopodia. Intracellular particle movement is primarily in the anterior direction, and the average rate of particle movement is roughly five times the rate of cellular translocation. Within seconds after the addition of 10(-6)M cAMP, there is a dramatic suppression of cellular translocation, an inhibition of pseudopod formation, a freeze in cellular morphology, a dramatic depression in intracellular particle movement, loss of F-actin localization in pseudopodia concomitant with relocalization of F-actin in the general cytoplasmic cortex under the plasma membrane, and a doubling of F-actin content. After 10 s, expansion zones are again visible at the cell perimeter, but they no longer are localized in the original anterior portion of the cell. There is a slight rebound in particle movement after 10 s, but particles with persistent tracks now show no directionality towards the original anterior portion of the cell, as they did before cAMP addition. Finally, in parallel with the resumption of peripheral expansion and the small rebound in particle movement, there is a decrease in total cellular F-actin to the untreated level. The pattern of microtubule organization is unaffected by the addition of cAMP.
