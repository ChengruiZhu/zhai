Two quality control devices, a light‐field device and a radiation‐field device, have been specially designed to assist the clinical implementation of conformal dynamic arc treatment (CDAT) and intensity‐modulated radiation therapy (IMRT). With these devices, the light field as well as the radiation field projected from the individual beams at any treatment position (i.e., arbitrary gantry angle) can be evaluated. The devices are attached at the front end of the couch and placed at the isocenter of the linear accelerator treatment system (LINAC). The devices are designed to be able to rotate parallel to the gantry head so that the light field and the radiation field projected from a direct beam can be assessed. The aim of this study was to evaluate the geometric precision of the beam placement and the dosimetric accuracy performed in CDAT and IMRT with the aid of these devices. The devices are placed separately from the LINAC during use and provide an independent check on the quality performance of the LINAC in three dimensions. The condition of gantry sagging and any mechanical displacement resulting in field shift can be observed and traced during gantry rotation. Mistakes that occur during the isocenter calibration can lead to significant displacement in the field projection, which would not be revealed with the conventional quality control setting (i.e., gantry 0°). This was demonstrated with the aid of the two quality control devices in the study. The influence of gravitational acceleration in the multi‐leaf collimator (MLC) leaf positioning error, which would consequently lead to inaccurate dose delivery, was investigated. The results of our study show that the existence of a gravitational influence is statistically significant, although the magnitude of the dose inaccuracy is small.
