Single-center, prospective cohort study of CLI patients ≥ 45 years of age, who underwent endovascular revascularization with overnight hospitalization. High-sensitive troponins T (hsTnTs) were measured on admission, 3–6 h after endovascular revascularization and the subsequent morning. Myocardial injury after endovascular revascularization was defined as an hsTnT ≥ 14 ng/L with a relative increase ≥ 30% from the baseline value. We also evaluated other myocardial injury hsTnT thresholds (i.e., ≥ 30, ≥ 40, ≥ 60, and ≥ 80 ng/L). 239 consecutive patients (56% male, mean age 71.5 ± 10.1 years) were included; one patient was lost to follow-up. At 1 year, there were 34 deaths (14.2%), and 48 MACE (20.5%). Myocardial injury with the hsTnT threshold of 14 ng/L and relative increase by ≥ 30% from the baseline level occurred in 61 patients (25.5%). Myocardial injury was independently associated with 1-year mortality ([aHR], 2.44; 95% CI 1.18–5.06, for hsTnT ≥ 14 ng/L to aHR, 3.34; 95% CI 1.29–8.65 for hsTnT ≥ 80 ng/L). Myocardial injury was also independently associated with 1-year MACE ([AOR] 2.89; 95% CI 1.41–5.92 for hsTnT ≥ 14 ng/L to AOR, 6.69; 95% CI 2.17–20.68 for hsTnT ≥ 80 ng/L). 85.2% patients who had myocardial injury did not have ischemic clinical symptoms or electrocardiography changes. In sensitive analysis with exclusion of symptomatic patients that developed myocardial injury for the hsTnT ≥ 14 ng/L threshold, both the 1-year mortality (aHR: 2.19; CI 1.02–4.68;
