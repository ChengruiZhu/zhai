Cellular responses to extracellular stimuli are driven by activation of intracellular signaling pathways. The interconnections between signaling pathways contribute to the high complexity of signaling networks, therefore playing an important role in response to treatment in pathological conditions. Thus, unraveling the network structure in a cell-context specific manner is key to predict cellular responses to perturbations. Here, we present a novel hybrid mathematical modeling strategy taking advantage of qualitative and quantitative modeling approaches. We combine interaction graph and dynamic modeling with quantitative experimental data to study the hepatocyte growth factor induced signaling network in primary mouse hepatocytes. Specifically, we analyze the interconnections within and between PI3K and MAPK signaling pathways involved in hepatocytes proliferation. Based on literature knowledge, more than 100000 potential network structures are possible. By applying our approach, we reduce this combinatorial complexity and select 16 minimal model structures. Subsequently, by performing a systematic model selection we select the model structure representing the experimental data best. We experimentally validate the resulting best model structure, and, based on model simulation, we are able to predict the outcome of combinatorial treatments. Our hybrid approach is applied to unravel cell-context specific network structures and to predict the outcome of intervention strategies.
