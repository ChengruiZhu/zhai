1205 patients met the inclusion criteria and were successfully enrolled. 697 (58%) were males, with a median cohort age of 26 years. The median time since their last ACL reconstruction was 3.4 years. Surgeons noted previous pathology in the medial meniscus (39%), lateral meniscus (20%), and articular surfaces (12%) at the time of revision surgery. Surgeons reported current pathology in the medial meniscus (45%), lateral meniscus (37%), MFC (43%), LFC (29%), MTP (11%), LTP (17%), patella (30%), and trochlea (20%). At 2 years, follow-up was obtained on 82% (989/1205). Previous meniscal pathology (both medial and lateral), as well as current AC pathology (in the MFC, LFC, MTP, LTP, and trochlea) were found to be significant drivers of poorer outcomes at 2 years (Table 1). The most consistent cartilage-related factors driving outcome in revision patients were previous lateral meniscus pathology and current trochlea AC pathology. Having a previous excision on the lateral meniscus resulted in significantly poorer outcomes on the IKDC (odds ratio=1.69; 95% CI=1.16-2.44; p=0.005), all KOOS subscales (OR range=1.54-2.08; 95% CI=1.04-3.03; p<0.029), and all WOMAC subscales (OR=1.56; 95% CI=1.06-2.27; p=0.02). Having a current Grade 3-4 AC chondrosis of the trochlea resulted in significantly poorer outcomes in the IKDC (OR=1.89; 95% CI=1.25-2.94; p-0.003), 4 of 5 KOOS subscales (OR range = 1.64-2.70; 95% CI=1.09-4.17; p<0.02), and 2 of 3 WOMAC subscales (OR range = 1.61-2.70; 95% CI=1.04-4.17; p<0.03). Lower baseline outcome scores, lower baseline activity level, and shorter time since the patientâ€™s last ACL reconstruction all significantly increased the odds of reporting poorer clinical outcomes at 2 years. Meniscal and AC pathology was not found to be a significant risk factor for 2 year activity levels. Interestingly, previous AC pathology and current meniscal pathology were not found to be significant risk factors for 2 year outcomes in this revision cohort.
