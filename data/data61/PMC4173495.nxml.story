Group B showed a statistically significant earlier onset of sensory (2.54 ± 0.87 vs. 3.66 ± 1.10 min) and motor blocks (2.22 ± 0.77 vs. 3.29 ± 1.06 min). The majority of patients in the group A (30%) attained the highest level of sensory block of T11, whereas the majority in group B (33.3%) attained the highest level of sensory block of T8. Majority in the Group A (60%) showed a motor block of Bromage scale Grade III at the beginning of surgery, whereas the majority in Group B (80%) showed a motor block of Bromage scale Grade IV. Duration of sensory block was significantly prolonged in group B (124.33 ± 14.84 vs. 115.60 ± 18.39 min). However, duration of motor blockade was similar in both groups. Group B patients required first analgesia earlier than Group A (5.24 ± 1.98 h vs. 2.48 ± 0.51 h) which was significant. There was no difference between groups with regard to HR intra-operatively. On comparison of the pre-induction MAP between 2 groups, there was no difference. But later on at 1, 3, 5 min intervals, the MAP was less in group B. But at 10 and 15 min there was no significant difference between groups. The significantly reduced MAP in group B was evident again at 30, 45, and 60 min. There was no difference between groups at 90 and 120 min. Group B required first analgesia earlier than group A which was statistically significant.
