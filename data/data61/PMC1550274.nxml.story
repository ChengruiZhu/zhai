Pathogens are masters of disguise, and frequently escape recognition by the immune response. Therefore, broad immune responses, directed at many epitopes of the pathogen, are thought to improve control of infection. There is evidence that competition between immune cells of different epitope specificity reduces the breadth of the immune response. It has been suggested that the resource that T cells compete for is access to antigen-presenting cells (APCs). However, the experimental data regarding competition for access to APCs is controversial. In this study, Scherer, Salath√©, and Bonhoeffer have used an individual-based model to investigate the mechanisms of T cell competition. They find that T cells only compete for access to APCs when epitopes are expressed abundantly on APCs. In contrast, when epitope expression is limiting, competition is for the specific epitope rather than for access to APCs. The distinction between competition for epitope and for access to APCs is relevant because the model predicts qualitatively different outcomes for either case. When competition is for the specific epitope, different epitope-specific T cell responses coexist readily and hence the immune response is broad. However, when T cells compete for access to APCs, immunodominant T cell responses can outcompete subdominant ones, which leads to narrow immune responses.
