Cdc42 GTPase-activating protein (CdGAP, also named ARHGAP31) is a negative regulator of the GTPases Rac1 and Cdc42. Associated with the rare developmental disorder Adams-Oliver Syndrome (AOS), CdGAP is critical for embryonic vascular development and VEGF-mediated angiogenesis. Moreover, CdGAP is an essential component in the synergistic interaction between TGFβ and ErbB-2 signaling pathways during breast cancer cell migration and invasion, and is a novel E-cadherin transcriptional co-repressor with Zeb2 in breast cancer. CdGAP is highly phosphorylated on serine and threonine residues in response to growth factors and is a substrate of ERK1/2 and GSK-3. Here, we identified Ser1093 and Ser1163 in the C-terminal region of CdGAP, which are phosphorylated by RSK in response to phorbol ester. These phospho-residues create docking sites for binding to 14-3-3 adaptor proteins. The interaction between CdGAP and 14-3-3 proteins inhibits the GAP activity of CdGAP and sequesters CdGAP into the cytoplasm. Consequently, the nucleocytoplasmic shuttling of CdGAP is inhibited and CdGAP-induced cell rounding is abolished. In addition, 14-3-3β inhibits the ability of CdGAP to repress the E-cadherin promoter and to induce cell migration. Finally, we show that 14-3-3β is unable to regulate the activity and subcellular localization of the AOS-related mutant proteins lacking these phospho-residues. Altogether, we provide a novel mechanism of regulation of CdGAP activity and localization, which impacts directly on a better understanding of the role of CdGAP as a promoter of breast cancer and in the molecular causes of AOS.
