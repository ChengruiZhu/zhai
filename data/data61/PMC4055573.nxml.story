Hybridization is the mating between individuals from two different species. While hybridization introduces genetic material into a host genome, this genetic material may be transient and is purged from the population within a few generations after hybridization. However, in other cases, the introduced genetic material persists in the population—a process known as introgression—and can have significant evolutionary implications. In this paper, we introduce a novel method for detecting introgression in genomes using a comparative genomic approach. The method scans multiple aligned genomes for signatures of introgression by incorporating phylogenetic networks and hidden Markov models. The method allows for teasing apart true signatures of introgression from spurious ones that arise due to population effects and resemble those of introgression. Using the new method, we analyzed two sets of variation data from chromosome 7 in mouse genomes. The method detected previously reported introgressed regions as well as new ones in one of the data sets. In the other data set, which was selected as a negative control, the method detected no introgression. Furthermore, our method accurately detected introgression in simulated evolutionary scenarios and accurately inferred related population genetic quantities. Our method enables systematic comparative analyses of genomes where introgression is suspected, and can work with genome-wide data.
