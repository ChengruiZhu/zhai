Down-regulation of miR-146b-5p contributes to tumorigenesis in several human cancers. However, the relevance of miR-146b-5p to prognosis, proliferation and apoptosis in gliomas remains unknown. In the present study, we demonstrated that miR-146b-5p expression was inversely correlated with grades and Ki-67 index in 147 human glioma specimens, but positively correlated with patients’ survival. Furthermore, two distinct subgroups of patients with grade I-IV gliomas with different prognoses were identified according to miR-146b-5p expression in our specimens. Cox regression showed that miR-146b-5p was an independent predictor for patients’ survival. Overexpression of miR-146b-5p dramatically suppressed glioma cell proliferation and induced apoptosis. Mechanistically, we validated TRAF6 as a direct functional target of miR-146b-5p and found that miR-146b-5p overexpression significantly decreased phosphorylated TAK1 and IκBα, the pivotal downstream effectors of TRAF6. Moreover, TRAF6 expression was positively correlated with glioma grades and Ki-67 index but inversely correlated with miR-146b-5p expression and predicted poor prognosis of glioma patients. In glioblastoma cell lines, silencing of TRAF6 could mimic the anti-tumor effect of miR-146b-5p. Our findings identify miR-146b-5p as a tumor suppressor and novel prognostic biomarker of gliomas, and suggest miR-146b-5p and TRAF6 as potential therapeutic candidates for malignant gliomas.
