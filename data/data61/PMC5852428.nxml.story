Increased the incidence of prediabetes and type 2 diabetes (T2D) worldwide raises an urgent need to develop effective tools for early disease detection to facilitate future preventive interventions and improve patientâ€™s care. We evaluated the suitability of diabetes-related miR-375 and miR-9 as earlier biomarkers for detecting prediabetes and T2D.TaqMan-based RT-qPCR was used to quantify the expression of miRNAs in peripheral blood of 30 prediabetes patients, 30 T2D patients and 30 non-diabetic healthy controls. Compared to controls, miR-375 and miR-9 were expressed at higher levels in prediabetes patients and progressively more enriched in T2D patients. Both miRNAs were directly associated with the presence of prediabetes and T2D independently of known risk factors to T2D and miR-375 was independently associated with the development of T2D. Both miRNAs were positively correlated with the glycemic status and other T2D risk factors. The ROC analysis indicated good diagnostic abilities for miR-375 to distinguish overall patients from control and prediabetes from T2D patients. Whereas, miR-9 showed lower values and borderline significance in discriminating the subject groups. The combination of miRNAs enhanced the predictability to discriminate patients from control. These results suggest that miR-375 and miR-9 are associated with the susceptibility to developing T2D and miR-375 alone or in combination with miR-9 could serve as biomarkers for early detection of prediabetes and T2D.
