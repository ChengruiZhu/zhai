The objective of the current study was to investigate the characteristics of DNA methylation patterns associated with the gastric cancer genome and to identify clinically useful diagnostic markers and therapeutic targets for gastric cancer. The Infinium 450K methylation microarray was used to compare differential DNA methylation sites of gastric cancer tissue with that of normal gastric tissue. The results of the DNA microarray analysis were confirmed by pyrosequencing. Functional analysis of the differential genes was performed using the GO software. The effect of candidate site methylation on gene expression was monitored using quantitative polymerase chain reaction analysis. Of the 2,645 differential methylation sites identified in gastric cancer tissues, 2,016 were hypermethylated sites, 629 were hypomethylated sites, 826 were located in promoter regions and 1,024 were located within genes. These differential sites were associated with 1,352 genes. In total, five sites were selected and pyrosequencing verified the results of the microarray analysis in five of the sites. Change in gastric cancer DNA methylation pattern was a common occurrence. Differential methylation sites appeared more often in non-promoter regions. The associated genes were involved in multiple signaling pathways, and hypermethylated and hypomethylated sites were involved in roughly the same signaling pathways. Methylation of the genome promoted gene expression.
