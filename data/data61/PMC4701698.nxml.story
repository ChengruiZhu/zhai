Tissue engineering is a new field of which the main purpose is to regenerate and repair the damaged tissues. Scaffolds serve as three dimensional matrices for neo-organogenesis and their substance can be biologic or synthetic. Natural polymers have good interactions with the cells and synthetic biomaterials are also highly useful in biomedical application because of their biocompatible properties. In addition to scaffold substance, surface properties of biomaterials have an important role in tissue engineering. In this study, we examined whether substrate substance is important for wound healing or its surface topography. Therefore, we fabricated two matrices, electrospun polycaprolactone (PCL) nanofibers and collagen/chitosan film, and implanted them to the same rat models. After 2 weeks, the sizes of healing wounds were measured and their cellular structures were evaluated by histochemistry and mmunohistochemistry. Histological staining showed a good level of cellularization and epidermis-dermis formation in PCL implant while no determinable epithelium was observed after 2 weeks in collagen-chitosan graft. Immunohistochemical study demonstrated the highly expressed pancytokeratin in PCL graft while its expression was weak in underdeveloped epidermis of collagen-chitosan implantation. In conclusion, this study suggested that PCL nanofibers with high surface area had a more ideal property than natural collagen-chitosan film, therefore the structure and topography of a matrix seemed to be more important in wound healing than its material substance.
