Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is characterized in the later stages by acute exacerbations that often require hospitalization. Pulmonary rehabilitation is recommended for patients with COPD to aid symptom control, improve quality of life and increase physical activity. We have previously reported a large intervention trial commenced during a hospital admission. The aim of this sub-study was to evaluate the patientsâ€™ experiences of discharge following the hospitalization for an acute exacerbation of COPD. During a programme of early rehabilitation (ER) patient perceptions, experiences and healthcare use were collated during the month that followed their discharge. ER (started during their admission) was comprised of exercise training techniques that were modified to suit the environment of acute illness, together with an education and self-management programme. Each patient was then supported on the programme by telephone contact, following their discharge home, at 48 hours, 2 weeks and 4 weeks. We collected information in relation to the walking and exercise progression; we monitored patient recall of healthcare use, compliance/understanding of medical therapy, as well as their wider perceptions that may have influenced the recovery process. Healthcare use was captured using GP records and data analysis. Of the 100 patients, 47 males, (mean (standard deviation)) 71 (9.3) years, FEV
