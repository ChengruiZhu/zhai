Gene expression involves a series of steps in which specific short DNA or RNA segments are recognized by nucleic acid–binding proteins. One step that is particularly prominent and complex in humans and other vertebrates is the removal of introns and the ligation of exons in the process of pre-mRNA splicing. To better understand the sequences in exons that regulate this process, the authors have developed a method termed Neighborhood Inference that predicts the splicing regulatory activity of RNA segments based on the known splicing enhancer or silencer activity of other segments that have closely neighboring sequences. This method is applied to predict hundreds of new exonic splicing regulatory elements, as well as splicing-neutral sequences. A number of these predictions were validated experimentally, indicating that the number of exonic splicing regulatory sequences is larger than previously suspected. Neighborhood Inference scoring is also used to show that selection on exonic splicing enhancers (ESEs) frequently allows conversion of one ESE sequence to another over evolutionary time periods, suggesting that ESEs are, to at least some degree, interchangeable in constitutively spliced exons. The methods described may also find application in the study of other biomolecular processes that involve sequence-specific nucleic acid–binding proteins.
