Mechanical flex of the gantry and mounted imaging panels leads to systematic offsets in localization image isocenter as a function of gantry angle for linear accelerator‐mounted image guidance systems. Subsequently, object positions obtained from localization radiographs may be offset, resulting in greater target positioning uncertainty. While current QA procedures measure kV/MV image agreement, these measurements do not provide insight to apparent isocenter position for either single imaging system as a function of gantry rotation. This study measures offset as a function of gantry angle in kV and MV imaging systems on four treatment machines to investigate the magnitude of systematic offsets and their reproducibility between systems and machines, as well as over time. It is shown that each machine and energy has a reproducible pattern of offset as a function of gantry angle that is independent of kV/MV agreement, and it varies by machine. kV and MV offset ranges are on the order of 1.5 mm in the R/L and A/P directions, and 0.5 mm in the S/I direction. Variability of kV‐MV agreement is on the order of 0.7 mm. At certain angles, combinations of localization images could show a compounded offset of over 2 mm, exceeding the desired certainty threshold. Since these trends are persistent over time for each machine, online correction for image offsets as a function of gantry angle could improve the margin of positioning uncertainty.
