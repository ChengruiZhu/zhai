There are very few surgical options available for treating a patient with winged scapula caused by a long thoracic nerve (LTN) injury. Therefore, we devised a novel technique based on a cadaveric dissection whereby regional intercostal nerves (ICN) were harvested and transposed to the adjacent LTN in 10 embalmed cadavers (20 sides). The LTN was identified along the lateral border of the serratus anterior and ICNs were identified at the mid-axillary line inferior to the lower edge of the pectoralis major muscle. Along the mid-clavicular line, each ICN was transected and transposed to the adjacent LTN. The length and diameter of each ICN available for mobilization to the LTN were measured. All measurements were made with microcalipers. Within the operative site, the mean proximal and distal diameters of the LTN were 1.6 and 1.1 mm, respectively. The adjacent ICN had a mean diameter of 1.3 mm. On all sides, the ICN branches were easily transposed to the adjacent LTN without any tension. Anastomosis to the LTN was performed to the third through sixth ICN provided each intercostal was preserved and mobilized anteriorly at least as far as the midclavicular line. The end to end size match between donor and LTN was appropriate on all sides. We found that it is feasible to harvest adjacent ICNs and move these to the adjacent LTN. Such a procedure, after being confirmed in patients, might offer a new technique for restoring protraction following an LTN injury.
