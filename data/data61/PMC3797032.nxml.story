Eukaryotic protein kinases (EPKs) have a highly conserved enzymatic kinase core that is involved in the regulation of numerous cell signaling processes through the transfer of a phosphate group from adenosine triphosphate (ATP) to more than 30% of human proteins. EPKs have been implicated in numerous human diseases, including cancer, cardiovascular diseases, and diabetes, making them one of the most sought-after therapeutic drug targets. The lack of structural diversity of the active kinase core has created a bottle-neck for designing successful therapeutic inhibitors. Here we describe the intramolecular interactions required for differentiating between the active and inactive states of EPKs. Kinases contain a hydrophobic regulatory spine (“R-spine”) that is disassembled in inactive kinases, and here we define an additional hydrophobic “Shell” that surrounds one end of the R-spine. Biochemical analysis of the five nonconsecutive R-spine residues and three nonconsecutive Shell residues shows that proper assembly of the R-spine and Shell is essential for maintaining kinase activity. Structural analysis of the 172 known structures of EPKs without bound ligands led to the identification of four inactive conformations that correlate with the disassembly of the R-spine. Understanding the molecular elements involved in the regulation of kinase activity and the identification of these diverse groups of inactive conformations should aid the design of more specific therapeutic EPK inhibitors.
