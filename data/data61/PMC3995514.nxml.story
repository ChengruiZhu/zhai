Gonadal dysgenesis, a condition in which gonadal development is interrupted leading to gonadal dysfunction, is a unique subset of disorders of sexual development (DSD) that encompasses a wide spectrum of phenotypes ranging from normally virilized males to slightly undervirilized males, ambiguous phenotype, and normal phenotypic females. It presents specific challenges in diagnostic work-up and management. In XY gonadal dysgenesis, the presence of a Y chromosome or Y-chromosome material renders the patient at increased risk for developing gonadal malignancy. No universally accepted guidelines exist for identifying the risk of developing a malignancy or for determining either the timing or necessity of performing a gonadectomy in patients with XY gonadal dysgenesis. Our goal was to evaluate the literature and develop evidence-based medicine guidelines with respect to the diagnostic work-up and management of patients with XY gonadal dysgenesis. We reviewed the published literature and used the Grading of Recommendation, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) system when appropriate to grade the evidence and to provide recommendations for the diagnostic work-up, malignancy risk stratification, timing or necessity of gonadectomy, role of gonadal biopsy, and ethical considerations for performing a gonadectomy. Individualized health care is needed for patients with XY gonadal dysgenesis, and the decisions regarding gonadectomy should be tailored to each patient based on the underlying diagnosis and risk of malignancy. Our recommendations, based on the evidence available, add an important component to the diagnostic and management armament of physicians who treat patients with these conditions.
