This study is concerned with the regulation of intracellular-free Mg2+ concentration ([Mg2+]i) in the smooth muscle of guinea pig taenia caeci. To assess an interaction of Ca2+ on the Na(+)-dependent Mg(2+)- extrusion mechanism (Na(+)-Mg2+ exchange), effects of Na+ removal (N- methyl-D-glucamine substitution) were examined in Ca(2+)-containing solutions. As changes in pHi in Na(+)-free solutions perturb estimation of [Mg2+]i using the single chemical shift only of the beta-ATP peak in 31P NMR (nuclear magnetic resonance) spectra, [Mg2+]i and pHi were concomitantly estimated from the chemical shifts of the gamma- and beta- peaks. When extracellular Na+ was substituted with N-methyl-D- glucamine, [Mg2+]i was reversibly increased. This increase in [Mg2+]i was eliminated in Mg(2+)-free solutions and enhanced in excess Mg2+ solutions. ATP content fluctuated little during removal and readmission of Na+, indicating that [Mg2+]i changes were not induced by Mg2+ release from ATP, and that Mg(2+)-extruding system would not be inhibited by fuel restriction. A slow acidification in Na(+)-free solutions and transient alkalosis by a readmission of Na+ were observed regardless of the extracellular Mg2+ concentration. When the extracellular Ca2+ concentration was increased from normal (2.4 mM) to 12 mM, only a marginal increase in [Mg2+]i was caused by Na+ removal, whereas a similar slow acidosis was observed, indicating that extracellular Ca2+ inhibits Mg2+ entry, and that the increase in [Mg2+]i is negligible through competition between Mg2+ and Ca2+ in intracellular sites. These results imply that Na(+)-Mg2+ exchange is the main mechanism to maintain low [Mg2+]i even under physiological conditions.
