Eph kinases and their ephrin ligands are widely expressed in epithelial cells in vitro and in vivo. Our results show that activation of endogenous EphA kinases in Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells negatively regulates hepatocyte growth factor/scatter factor (HGF)â€“induced branching morphogenesis in collagen gel. Cotreatment with HGF and ephrin-A1 reduced sprouting of cell protrusions, an early step in branching morphogenesis. Moreover, addition of ephrin-A1 after HGF stimulation resulted in collapse and retraction of preexisting cell protrusions. In a newly developed assay that simulates the localized interactions between Ephs and ephrins in vivo, immobilized ephrin-A1 suppressed HGF-induced MDCK cell scattering. Ephrin-A1 inhibited basal ERK1/2 mitogen-activated protein kinase activity; however, the ephrin-A1 effect on cell protrusion was independent of the mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway. Ephrin-A1 suppressed HGF-induced activation of Rac1 and p21-activated kinase, whereas RhoA activation was retained, leading to the preservation of stress fibers. Moreover, dominant-negative RhoA or inhibitor of Rho-associated kinase (Y27632) substantially negated the inhibitory effects of ephrin-A1. These data suggest that interfering with c-Met signaling to Rho GTPases represents a major mechanism by which EphA kinase activation inhibits HGF-induced MDCK branching morphogenesis.
