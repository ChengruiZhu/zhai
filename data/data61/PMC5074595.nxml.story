The bistable switch, a common regulatory sub-network, is found in many biological processes. It consists of cross-repressing components that generate a switch-like transition between two possible states. In developing tissues, bistable switches, created by cross-repressing transcriptional determinants, are often controlled by gradients of secreted signalling moleculesâ€”morphogens. These provide a mechanism to convert a morphogen gradient into stripes of gene expression that determine the arrangement of distinct cell types. Here we use mathematical models to analyse the temporal response of such a system. We find that the behaviour is highly dependent on the intrinsic fluctuations that result from the stochastic nature of gene expression. This noise has a marked effect on both patterning time and the location of the stripe boundary. One of the techniques we use, Minimum Action Path theory, identifies key features of the switch without computationally expensive calculations. The results reveal a noise driven switching wave that propels the stripe boundary away from the morphogen source to eventually settle, at steady state, further from the morphogen source than in the deterministic description. Together the analysis highlights the importance dynamics in patterning and demonstrates a set of mathematical tools for studying this problem.
