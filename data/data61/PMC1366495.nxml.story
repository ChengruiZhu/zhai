Animal development requires cells in complex organs to acquire distinct identities. During the development of the body wall musculature of the fruit fly, a pool of apparently identical cells gives rise to two types of muscle precursors, both of which are required for the appearance of functioning muscles. These identities depend on broad programs of gene expression. The authors attempt to dissect the complements of expressed genes that define these two different cell types by integrating modern methods in genetics, genomics, and informatics. By purifying informative cells from normal embryos and mutants that perturb muscle development, assaying their genomewide gene expression programs, and combining experiments statistically, they have identified fivefold more founder-specific genes than were previously suspected to characterize this cell type. The expression patterns of hundreds of genes were examined in whole embryos to test the statistical predictions, permitting the authors to estimate how many more cell typeâ€“specific genes remain to be discovered. Finally, dozens of the genes highlighted by these methods were tested for direct involvement in muscle development, and several new players in this process are reported. The integrated strategy used here can be generalized for studying genetic programs in other complex tissues.
