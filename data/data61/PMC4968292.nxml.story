Patients were treated with cACI prior to February 2010. After this date the senior author switched to the cs-ACI technique for all patients. For the cs-ACI technique, cultured chondrocytes were seeded in the OR onto a collagen membrane, which was subsequently placed into the cartilage defect and secured with a running suture and/or fibrin glue. Thirty-nine patients treated with the cs-ACI technique fulfilled the inclusion requirements of minimum 2 year follow-up and complete data set. A comparison group was composed of 45 patients treated prior to the switch date with standard ACI (cACI) in which a suspension of cultured chondrocytes was injected into a debrided chondral defect underneath a sutured collagen cover. Prospectively collected data were retrieved from our IRB-approved database. Both groups followed an identical post-operative protocol. The outcomes were measured with the 12-Item Short-Form Health Survey (SF-12), International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) score, Knee injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS), Lysholm knee scale, and Tegner activity scale. We defined failure as any graft removal of more than 25% of the original defect size, for example through revision with allograft or arthroplasty. Mann-Whitney U tests were used to compare mean scores between groups preoperatively and at the latest follow-up; chi-square test was used to detect differences between groups. Graft survivorship was calculated by the Kaplan-Meier method, and distributions were compared using the log rank test.
