Thirty subjects (13 normal knee function, 17 below normal knee function) with an isolated ACLR, who participated in jumping, cutting and pivoting activities ≥ 50 hrs/yr prior to their injury, were included in this study. Study enrollment required ≥ 80% quadriceps strength, minimal knee joint effusion and ≥ 12 weeks after surgery. Subjects were randomized to two treatment groups. The standard care group received 10 training sessions including quadriceps strengthening exercises, ACL injury prevention exercises and agility drills. The perturbation group received all standard care exercises augmented with perturbation training. Pre-training patient reported measures of fear of re-injury included the Tampa Scale of Kinesiophobia (TSK-11) and the ACL-Return to Sport after Injury (ACL-RSI). Knee function was measured with the Knee injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS4), as a mean of the pain, symptoms, sports and recreation, and quality of life subscales. Each subscale (KOOS-pain, KOOS-symptoms, KOOS-ADLs, KOOS-sport/rec, KOOS-QoL) was also assessed individually. After the training program was completed, self-reported knee function was measured with the International Knee Documentation Committee subjective knee form (IKDC 2000). Age- and sex-matched normative values were determined based on the top 15th percentile of healthy measures. A binary logistic regression was used to determine which variables significantly predicted normal knee function after training.
