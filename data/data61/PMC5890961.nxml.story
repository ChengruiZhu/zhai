Intravenous alteplase is the only approved treatment for acute ischemic stroke. Tenecteplase, a genetically engineered, mutant tissue plasminogen activator, is an alternative thrombolytic agent. The economic feasibility of stroke treatment has been a matter of huge debate and discussion thus far. The use of thrombolytics for the management of ischemic stroke has recently begun in Nepal. In low-income countries like Nepal, where the per capita income falls at just $691.7 and 25.2% of the population are under the poverty line, stroke patients cannot meet treatment expenses. Tenecteplase is easily available (for the management of acute coronary syndrome) in tertiary-level hospitals of Nepal and the price quote of tenecteplase ($450) is half the price of alteplase ($1000). In emergency cases, sometimes, the cost of alteplase can be greater than the patient can afford and they can't undergo thrombolysis even after arriving on time. However, evidence exists that supports the use of other alternatives (tenecteplase), which are also effective in the management of acute ischemic stroke. In this article, we examined current evidence for the efficacy and safety of tenecteplase when compared to alteplase. This review will make neurologists in Nepal familiar with the efficacy and safety of tenecteplase in comparison with alteplase since it is common for patients to not be able to afford the expensive alteplase, which makes guideline-based practice impossible some times.
