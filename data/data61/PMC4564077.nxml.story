The present study aimed to investigate the molecular targets for colorectal cancer (CRC). Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were screened between CRC and matched adjacent noncancerous samples. GENETIC_ASSOIATION_DB_DISEASE analysis was performed to identify CRC genes from the identified DEGs using the Database for Annotation, Visualization and Integrated Discovery, followed by Gene ÎŸntology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes analysis for the CRC genes. A protein-protein interaction (PPI) network was constructed for the CRC genes, followed by determination and analysis of the hub genes, in terms of the protein domains and spatial structure. In total, 35 CRC genes were determined, including 19 upregulated and 16 downregulated genes. Downregulated N-acetyltransferase (NAT)1 and NAT2 were enriched in the caffeine metabolism pathway. The down-regulated and upregulated genes were enriched in a number of GO terms and pathways, respectively. Cyclin D1 (CCND1) and proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) were identified as the hub genes in the PPI network. The C-terminal and N-terminal domains were similar in PCNA, but different in CCND1. The results suggested PCNA, CCND1, NAT1 and NAT2 for use as biomarkers to enable early diagnosis and monitoring of CRC. These results form a basis for developing therapies, which target the unique protein domains of PCNA and CCND1.
