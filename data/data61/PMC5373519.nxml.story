Fasting can selectively protect normal cells against the deleterious side effects of chemotherapy while sensitizing cancer cells to therapy. This is, in part, due to the reallocation of energy from growth to protection in normal cells but not cancer cells in response to reduced nutrient availability. Because glucose sensitizes yeast cells to stress and considering that several widely used drugs that increase glucose levels are administered in combination with chemotherapy, we tested the role of glucose reduction on the sensitivity of normal cells and mice to the chemotherapy drug doxorubicin (DXR). We show that fasting or glucose restriction (GR) reduce protein kinase A (PKA) activation and increase AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) activity. These signal transduction changes cause the activation of the conserved zinc finger stress-resistance transcription factor early growth response protein 1 (EGR1) (Msn2/4 in yeast) to protect cardiomyocytes from doxorubicin toxicity. These results provide evidence for a glucose-sensing pathway that negatively regulates a stress response conserved from yeast to mammalian cells. These studies also suggest that the common use of drugs that cause hyperglycemia, such as dexamethasone (Dexa) and rapamycin, could increase the toxicity of cancer drugs to normal tissues and organs while making glucose available to cancer cells.
