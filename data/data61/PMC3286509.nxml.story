Frozen bone-patellar tendon bone allografts are useful in anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction as the freezing procedure kills tissue cells, thereby reducing immunogenicity of the grafts. However, a small portion of cells in human femoral heads treated by standard bone-bank freezing procedures survive, thus limiting the effectiveness of allografts. Here, we characterized the survival rates and mechanisms of cells isolated from rat bones and tendons that were subjected to freeze–thaw treatments, and evaluated the influence of these treatments on the mechanical properties of tendons. After a single freeze–thaw cycle, most cells isolated from frozen bone appeared morphologically as osteocytes and expressed both osteoblast- and osteocyte-related genes. Transmission electron microscopic observation of frozen cells using freeze-substitution revealed that a small number of osteocytes maintained large nuclei with intact double membranes, indicating that these osteocytes in bone matrix were resistant to ice crystal formation. We found that tendon cells were completely killed by a single freeze–thaw cycle, whereas bone cells exhibited a relatively high survival rate, although survival was significantly reduced after three freeze–thaw cycles. In patella tendons, the ultimate stress, Young’s modulus, and strain at failure showed no significant differences between untreated tendons and those subjected to five freeze–thaw cycles. In conclusion, we identified that cells surviving after freeze–thaw treatment of rat bones were predominantly osteocytes. We propose that repeated freeze–thaw cycles could be applied for processing bone-tendon constructs prior to grafting as the treatment did not affect the mechanical property of tendons and drastically reduced surviving osteocytes, thereby potentially decreasing allograft immunogenecity.
