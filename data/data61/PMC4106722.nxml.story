Protein synthesis by ribosomal translation is a vital cellular process, but our understanding of its regulation has been poor. Because the number of ribosomes in the cell is limited, rapid growth relies on fast translational elongation. The accuracy of translation must also be maintained, and in an ideal scenario, both speed and accuracy should be maximized to sustain rapid and productive growth. However, existing data suggest a tradeoff between speed and accuracy, making it impossible to simultaneously maximize both. A potential solution is slowing the elongation at functionally or structurally important sites to ensure their translational accuracies, while sacrificing accuracy for speed at other sites. Here, we show that budding yeast and mouse embryonic stem cells indeed use this strategy. We discover that a codon-by-codon adaptive modulation of translational elongation is accomplished by mRNA secondary structures, which serve as brakes to control the elongation speed and hence translational fidelity. Our findings explain why highly expressed genes tend to have strong mRNA folding, slow translational elongation, and conserved protein sequences. The exquisite translational modulation reflects the power of natural selection in mitigating efficiencyâ€“accuracy conflicts, and our study offers a general framework for analyzing similar conflicts, which are widespread in biology.
