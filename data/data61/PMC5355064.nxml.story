The prognostic role of systemic inflammatory response (SIR) markers is unclear in patients with non-muscle invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC). Here, we aimed to investigate the prognostic role of various SIR markers in the oncological outcomes in non-muscle invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC) patients at a single institution in Korea. Neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio (NLR), derived-NLR (dNLR), and platelet-lymphocyte ratio (PLR) were examined as SIR markers. We retrospectively collected data of 1,698 NMIBC patients who underwent transurethral resection of the bladder (TURB) between 1990 and 2013. After excluding 147 patients, the study population finally consisted of 1,551 individuals. Overall survival (OS), cancer-specific survival (CSS), recurrence-free survival (RFS), and progression-free survival (PFS) were analyzed by using Kaplan-Meier estimates. Multivariate Cox regression model was adopted to identify the predictors of oncological outcomes. Notably, elevated NLR (≥2.0), dNLR (≥1.5) and PLR (≥124) were associated with poor OS outcomes. Patients with increased NLR, but not dNLR and PLR, only had poor CSS estimates compared to those with lower NLR. However, no significant differences were found in RFS and PFS according to the SIR status. In the multivariate Cox regression analysis, elevated NLR was identified as a key predictor of OS [hazard ratio (HR)=1.52, 95% confidence interval (CI)=1.19-1.95], in addition to age (HR=1.07, 95% CI=1.05-1.08), hemoglobin (HR=0.83, 95% CI=0.78-0.88), and high grade tumor (HR=1.88, 95% CI=1.45-1.08). With respect to CSS, increased NLR was also identified as an independent predictor (HR=1.12, 95% CI=1.01-1.25). In summary, our results indicate that NLR can be a very reliable SIR marker for predicting the oncological outcomes, particularly mortality outcomes.
