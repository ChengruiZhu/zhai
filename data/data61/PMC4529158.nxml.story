During development, neural progenitors generate all cells that make up the mammalian brain. Differences in brain size among the various mammalian species are attributed to differences in the abundance and proliferative capacity of a specific class of neural progenitors called basal progenitors. Among these, a specific progenitor type called basal radial glia is thought to have played an important role during evolution in the expansion of the neocortex, the part of the brain associated with higher cognitive functions like conscious thought and language. In the neocortex, the expression of the transcription factor Pax6 in basal progenitors is low in rodents, but high in primates, including humans. In this study, we aimed to mimic the elevated expression pattern of Pax6 seen in humans in basal progenitors of the embryonic mouse neocortex. To this end, we generated a novel, transgenic mouse line that allows sustained expression of the Pax6 gene in basal progenitors. This elevated expression resulted in an increase in the generation of basal radial glia, in the proliferative capacity of basal progenitors, and, ultimately, in the number of neurons produced. Our findings demonstrate that altering the expression of a single transcription factor from a mouse to a human-like pattern suffices to induce a primate-like proliferative behaviour in neural progenitors, which is thought to underlie the evolutionary expansion of the neocortex.
