Absence of effective therapeutic methods for avascular necrosis of femoral head (ANFH) is still perplexing the worldâ€™s medical community. Bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs) adoptive cell therapy combined with core decompression is a promising modality, which is highly dependent on the cellular activities of BMSCs. Hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) is a survival factor for BMSCs, yet the underlying mechanism is not fully elucidated. In this study, the effects of multiplicity of infections (MOIs) of recombinant adenovirus carrying HGF gene (rAd-HGF) on human BMSC proliferation and osteogenic differentiation were systemically examined. Infection of rAd-HGF produced secretory HGF and promoted hBMSC proliferation in a MOI-dependent manner, while the osteogenesis was also strengthened as indicated by enhanced calcium nodule formation with the strongest effects achieved at MOI = 250. Blocking the activities of c-MET or its downstream signaling pathways, WNT, ERK1/2, and PI3K/AKT led to differential consequents. Specifically, blockage of the WNT pathway significantly promoted osteogenic differentiation, which also showed additive effects when combined application with rAd-HGF. Our data demonstrated the pro-osteogenic effects of optimized MOIs of rAd-HGF, while inhibition of WNT pathway or activation of PI3K/AKT pathway may act as candidate adjuvant modalities for promoting osteogenic differentiation in rAd-HGF-modified hBMSC treatment on ANFH.
