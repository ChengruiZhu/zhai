The cell interacts with its environment in both biochemical and mechanical ways. In this study we explore one of the ways in which the cell interacts mechanically with its environment. α-Actinin is a cytoskeletal crosslinker: it functions to scaffold the cytoskeletal actin filaments that provide mechanical reinforcement to the cell. In its functional environment α-actinin is exposed to a multitude of mechanical stresses as it attaches itself to a dynamic network of actin filaments. The actin filaments extend, rotate, and bend the α-actinin crosslinkers. In this study we employ molecular dynamics techniques to understand the structural characteristics of α-actinin that underlie its ability to provide a scaffold in such a stressed environment. We analyzed the natural frequencies of α-actinin and simulated force-induced bending, extension, and twisting. Our results suggest that α-actinin has structural flexibility facilitating crosslinking in a dynamic environment and also structural rigidity stabilizing the linkage in the stressed environment. We have discovered novel natural bending movements of the rod domain that enhance its function as a crosslinker. We have also demonstrated the specific structural characteristics of α-actinin that give it the previously suggested property of having partial flexibility. Our results enhance the understanding of structural mechanics in the cytoskeletal molecules.
