The purpose of this study was to quantify the variability of the breast surface position when aligning whole‐breast patients to bony landmarks based on MV portal films or skin marks alone. Surface imaging was used to assess the breast surface position of 11 whole‐breast radiotherapy patients, but was not used for patient positioning. On filmed fractions, AlignRT v5.0 was used to capture the patient's surface after initial positioning based on skin marks (28 “preshifts” surfaces), and after treatment couch shifts based on MV films (41 “postshifts” surfaces). Translations and rotations based on surface captures were recorded, as well as couch shifts based on MV films. For nonfilmed treatments, “daily” surface images were captured following positioning to skin marks alone. Group mean and systematic and random errors were calculated for all datasets. Pearson correlation coefficients, setup margins, and 95% limits of agreement (LOA) were calculated for preshifts translations and MV film shifts. LOA between postshifts surfaces and the filmed treatment positions were also computed. All the surface captures collected were retrospectively compared to both a DICOM reference surface created from the planning CT and to an AlignRT reference surface. All statistical analyses were performed using the DICOM reference surface dataset. AlignRT reference surface data was only used to calculate the LOA with the DICOM reference data. This helped assess any outcome differences between both reference surfaces. Setup margins for preshifts surfaces and MV films range between 8.3–12.0 mm and 5.4–13.4 mm, respectively. The largest margin is along the left–right (LR) direction for preshift surfaces, and along craniocaudal (CC) for films. LOA ranges between the preshifts surfaces and MV film shifts are large (12.6–21.9 mm); these decrease for postshifts surfaces (9.8–18.4 mm), but still show significant disagreements between the two modalities due to their focus on different anatomical landmarks (patient's topography versus bony anatomy). Pearson's correlation coefficients further support this by showing low to moderate correlations in the anterior–posterior (AP) and LR directions (0.47–0.69) and no correlation along
