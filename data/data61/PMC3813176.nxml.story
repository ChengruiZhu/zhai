essential oil (SKE) and possible protective effect of SKE on lipid profile, atherogenic index and liver enzyme markers in Alloxan-induced Type 1 diabetic rats. Thirty male rats were randomly divided into three groups; group one as control, group two diabetic untreatment, and group three treatments with SKE by 500 ppm in drinking water, respectively. Diabetes was induced in the second and third groups by alloxan injection subcutaneously. After 8 weeks, the levels of fasting blood glucose (FBG), triglyceride (TG), cholesterol (C), low density lipoprotein (LDL), very low density lipoprotein (VLDL), high density lipoprotein (HDL), atherogenic index and the activities of alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alkaline phosphatase (ALP) of all groups were analyzed. Data were analyzed through non-parametric Man Whitney test (using SPSS 13 software) and p < 0.05 was considered significant. SKE inhibited significantly the activities of ALT and ALP and decrease FBG, TG, C, LDL and VLDL. HDL level was significantly increased when treated with the extract. The activities of AST stayed unaltered. Moreover, total antioxidant capacity of SKE was 3.20 Â± 0.40 nmol of ascorbic acid equivalents/g SKE. This study showed that SKE is a source of potent antioxidants. The findings of the present study also suggest that SKE exert beneficial effects on the lipid profile, atherogenic index and liver enzymes activity in Alloxan-induced Type 1 diabetic rats.
