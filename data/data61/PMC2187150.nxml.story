An improved method is described for selecting mutant cells with an altered pattern of Ia antigenic determinants and antigen-presenting properties from an homogeneous population of functional antigen- presenting cells (APC). The APC line used, TA3, was a somatic cell hybrid obtained by fusing normal heterozygous H-2a/d B cells with a drug-marked variant of a BALB/c B lymphoma line. Two phenotypic groups of mutants were obtained by this method. Serologic analysis with a panel of anti-I-Ak monoclonal antibodies suggested that the change in the first group of mutants (type A mutants) involved the alteration of a portion of one epitope of the I-Ak molecule while in the second group of mutants (type B), an alteration of a different Ia epitope group had occurred. Functional studies using a panel of cloned antigen-specific and autoreactive T cell hybridomas demonstrated that the loss of a limited number of I-Ak determinants in the type A mutants correlated with the loss of some but not all I-Ak-encoded restriction elements, while the type B mutation(s) resulted in the ablation of all I-Ak- restricted APC functions tested. These mutations may occur in the region of the Ia molecule that interacts with the T cell receptor (the histope) or in a postulated region that interacts with antigen (the desetope). The finding that both type A and B mutations lead to loss in the capacity to be corecognized with many different antigens by I-Ak- restricted T cell hybridomas suggests that the Ia molecule may possess very few distinct histotopes and/or desetopes or that the tertiary structure of the Ia molecule is crucial in the formation of these sites. Alternatively, the mutations, particularly the type B mutations, may have led to the failure of expression of an entire alpha or beta chain.
