MicroRNA (miRNA) pathways have been implicated in stem cell regulation. This study investigated the molecular effects of propofol on adipocyte stem cells (ASCs) by analyzing RNA expression arrays. Human ASCs were isolated by use of a liposuction procedure. ASCs were treated with saline, 50 µM propofol, or 100 µM propofol in culture media for 3 hours. After the isolation of total RNA, the expression of 76 miRNAs was evaluated with peptide nucleic acid-miRNA array analysis through denaturation and hybridization processes. Treatment with 50 µM propofol resulted in significant down-regulation of expression of 18 miRNAs and upregulation of expression of 25 miRNAs; 100 µM propofol resulted in significant downregulation of expression of 14 miRNAs and upregulation of expression of 29 miRNAs. The lowest expression was seen for miR-204, which was 0.07-fold with 50 µM propofol and 0.18-fold with 100 µM propofol. The highest expression was seen for miR-208b, which was 11.23-fold with 50 µM propofol and 11.20-fold with 100 µM propofol. Expression patterns of miRNAs were not significantly different between 50 µM and 100 µM propofol treatment. The results of this study suggest that propofol is involved in altering the miRNA expression level in human ASCs. Additional research is necessary to establish the functional effect of miRNA alteration by propofol.
