This article reports the recommendations of the Scientific Department of
Cognitive Neurology and Aging of the Brazilian Academy of Neurology for the
treatment of Alzheimerâ€™s disease (AD) in Brazil, with special focus on
behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia (BPSD). It constitutes a
revision and broadening of the 2005 guidelines based on a consensus involving
researchers (physicians and non-physicians) in the field. The authors carried
out a search of articles published since 2005 on the MEDLINE, LILACS and
Cochrane Library databases. The search criteria were pharmacological and
non-pharmacological treatment of the behavioral and psychological symptoms of
AD. Studies retrieved were categorized into four classes, and evidence into four
levels, based on the 2008 recommendations of the American Academy of Neurology.
The recommendations on therapy are pertinent to the dementia phase of AD.
Recommendations are proposed for the treatment of BPSD encompassing both
pharmacological (including acetyl-cholinesterase inhibitors, memantine,
neuroleptics, anti-depressives, benzodiazepines, anti-convulsants plus other
drugs and substances) and non-pharmacological (including education-based
interventions, physiotherapy, occupational therapy, music therapy, therapy using
light, massage and art therapy) approaches. Recommendations for the treatment of
cognitive disorders of AD symptoms are included in a separate article of this
edition.
