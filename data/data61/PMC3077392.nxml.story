All kinds of muscular dystrophies (MDs) are characterized by progressive muscle wasting due to life-long proliferation of precursor cells of myo- (muscle), fibro- (connective tissue), and lipogenic (fat) origin. Despite discovery of many MD genes over the past 25 years, MDs still represent debilitating, incurable diseases, which frequently lead to premature death. Thus, it is imperative to gain novel insights into the underlying MD pathomechanisms. Here, we show that different mouse models for the most common human MDs frequently develop skeletal musculature-associated tumors, presenting as complex sarcomas, consisting of myo-, lipo-, and fibrogenic compartments. Collectively, these tumors are characterized by profound genomic instability such as DNA damage, recurring mutations in cancer genes, and aberrant chromosome copy numbers. We also demonstrate the presence of these cancer-related aberrations in dystrophic muscles from MD mice prior to formation of visible sarcomas. Moreover, we discovered corresponding genomic lesions also in skeletal muscles from human MD patients, as well as stem cells cultured thereof, and show that genomic instability precedes muscle degeneration in MDs. We thus propose that cancer-like genomic instability represents a novel, unifying pathomechanism underlying the entire group of genetically distinct MDs, which will hopefully open new therapeutic avenues.
