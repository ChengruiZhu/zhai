 to detect morphological evidence of EMT by phase-contrast microscopy. These cells were randomly divided into 4 groups as follows: the control group, the TGF-β1 group, the SIS3 (specific inhibitor of Smad3) group and the BMSCs-CM group. The immunofluorescence method was used to determined the location of E-cadherin (E-calcium mucins; E-cad), α-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA) and p-Smad3. The expression levels of E-cad, CK8, α-SMA, vimentin, p-Smad3, Snail1, collagen I (COLI) and collagen III (COLIII) were detected by western blot analysis. Following exposure to TGF-β1, the A549 cells displayed a spindle-shaped fibroblast-like morphology. In accordance with these morphological changes, the expression levels of E-cad and CK8 were downregulated, while the expression levels of α-SMA and vimentin were upregulated. Along with this process, the expression levels of p-Smad3, Snail1, COLI and COLIII were increased. However, the cells in the BMSCs-CM group and SIS3 group exhibited a decrease in the levels of α-SMA and vimentin (which had been upregulated by TGF-β1), and an increase in the levels of E-cad and CK8 expression (which had been downregulated by TGF-β1). On the whole, these results indicated that BMSCs-CM suppressed the EMT which might be associated with TGF-β1/Smad3. This study provides the theoretical basis for the research of the mechanisms responsible for pulmonary disease.
