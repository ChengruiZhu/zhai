Previous studies demonstrated that lymphoid tissues of mice and rats contain small numbers (less than 1 percent of nucleated cells) of dendritic cells (DC) with special cytologic, surface, and functional properties. We show here that similar DC represent 0.1-0.5 percent of human peripheral blood mononuclear cells. DC can be enriched to 20-60 percent purity by a multistep procedure analogous to that used in mice. Adherent peripheral blood mononuclear cells are cultured overnight, and the released cells are depleted of monocytes and B cells by readherence to plastic, rosetting with erythrocytes coated with anti-human IgG, and centrifugation in dense albumin columns. Enriched DC have similar cytologic features to rodent DC by light and electron microscopy. DC express HLA, and HLA-DR and the leukocyte-common antigens. They lack phagocytic capacity, receptors for antibody-coated and neuraminidase-treated erythrocytes, surface and intracellular Ig, esterase, peroxidase, and azurophilic granules. DC do not react with several monoclonal antibodies directed to phagocytes (OKM 1, “mac-1,” 63D3, and 61D3) and T cells (OKT 3, 6, 8). Unlike the mouse, human DC express complement receptors. When maintained in culture for 4 d, human DC did not give rise to either B cells or monocytes. Therefore, DC identified by cytologic criteria are distinct from other leukocytes. Enriched populations of DC have been compared to fractions enriched in monocytes, B cells, and T cells in three functional assays: stimulation of the primary allogeneic mixed leukocyte reaction, stimulation of the primary syngeneic MLR, and accessory function for the proliferation of periodate- modified T cells. In each case, the DC fraction was 10-fold or more active than other cell fractions. We conclude that DC circulate in man, and represent the principal cell type required for the initiation of several immune responses.
