We collated and analysed data from hospital records regarding the cause of death of 18,385 patients with diabetes who died in 282 medical institutions throughout Japan over the 10‐year period between 1991 and 2000. Autopsy was carried out in 1750 cases. The most frequent cause of death in all 18,385 cases was malignant neoplasia, accounting for 34.1% of cases, followed by vascular diseases (including diabetic nephropathy, ischemic heart diseases and cerebrovascular diseases) in 26.8%, infections in 14.3%, and then diabetic coma in 1.2%. The most common malignancy was liver cancer, accounting for 8.6% of all the deaths. Of the deaths from vascular diseases, diabetic nephropathy was the cause of death in 6.8% of cases, and the frequency as cause of death for ischemic heart diseases and cerebrovascular diseases were similar at 10.2% and 9.8%, respectively. Myocardial infarction accounted for almost all the deaths from ischemic heart diseases, whereas deaths from cerebral infarction were 2.2‐fold as common as those from cerebral hemorrhage. In the analyses of the relationship between age and causes of death in diabetic patients who underwent autopsy, the overall mortality rate as a result of vascular diseases increased with age, although the mortality rates from diabetic nephropathy and cerebrovascular diseases increased little from the fifth decade of life. The mortality rate from ischemic heart diseases increased with age, however, and was higher than the other forms of vascular diseases from the sixth decade of life, accounting for approximately 50% of vascular deaths in the eighth decade. Malignant neoplasia was the most frequent cause of death from the fifth decade of life, and was extremely common in the seventh decade, accounting for 46.3% of all the deaths. The mortality rate from infections varied little between age groups from the fifth decade of life. In the analyses of glycemic control and the age at the time of death, lifespans were 2.5 years shorter in males, and 1.6 years shorter in female diabetics with poor glycemic control than in those with good or fair glycemic control. This difference was greater for deaths as a result of infections and vascular diseases, particularly diabetic nephropathy, than for malignant neoplasia. Analysis of the relationship between glycemic control and the duration of diabetes and deaths as a result of vascular diseases showed no correlation between the level of glycemic control and death from diabetic nephropathy, ischemic heart diseases or cerebrovascular diseases. In diabetics with disease durations of less than 10 years, the mortality rate from macroangiopathy was higher than that as a result of diabetic nephropathy, a form of microangiopathy. Treatment for diabetes comprised of diet alone in 21.5%, oral hypoglycemic agents in 29.5%, and insulin with or without oral hypoglycemic agents in 44.2%, which was the most common. In particular, 683/1170 (58.4%) diabetics who died from diabetic nephropathy were on insulin therapy, a higher proportion than the 661/1687 (39.2%) who died from ischemic heart diseases, or the 659/1622 (40.6%) who died from cerebrovascular diseases. The average age at the time of death in the survey population was, 68 years for males and 71.6 years for females. These were 9.6 and 13 years, respectively, short of the average life expectancy for the Japanese general population. In comparison with the previous survey (1981–1990), the average age at the time of death had increased 1.5 years for males, and 3.2 years for females. The average life expectancy for the Japanese general population had also increased 1.7 and 2.7 years, respectively, over that period, showing that advances in the management and treatment of diabetes have not led to any improvement in patients’ life expectancies.
