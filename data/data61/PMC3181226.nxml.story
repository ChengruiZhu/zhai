Cancer progression has been depicted as a linear process, during which the incipient cancer cell sequentially accumulates mutations that confer the ability to metastasize. However, recent studies show that cancer cells disseminate early, before such mutations can accumulate, implying the existence of a different, faster route to the metastatic phenotype. Using a mouse model of melanoma, we show that the primary tumor attracts a subset of immune cells that actively promote cancer cell motility, dissemination, and metastasis. These tumor-infiltrating immune cells do so by reactivating a cellular program (mesenchymal transition) used by melanocytes during their development to colonize the skin, and also believed to be an essential step in cancer cell dissemination and metastasis. Once the melanoma cells migrate out of the primary tumor, they can lapse back to their original phenotype and lose their migratory potential. This transient phenotypic switch may accelerate carcinogenesis and participate in the plasticity of cancer. It explains how cancer cells might spread to other organs even before the original tumor is detected. In addition to the evidence gleaned from our mouse melanoma model, we show that these immune cells induce typical features of epithelial-mesechymal transition in both melanoma and bladder human cell lines when examined in culture dishes. These findings provide an underlying mechanism for the long-recognized link between inflammation and cancer progression.
