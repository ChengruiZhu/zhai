Each neuron communicates signals via synaptic connections simultaneously to several hundreds of neighboring neurons forming a synaptic circuit. Determining the pattern of synaptic connections between local neurons is crucial for understanding a specific cortical function implemented by a synaptic circuit. The connectivity between a pair of neurons is affected by their axonal/dendritic morphologies and relative spatial locations. Although neuroscientists have precise tools to measure neuronal activity caused by the flow of signals between circuit neurons, there are still considerable difficulties in the direct experimental measurement of local synaptic connectivity, which actually determines the underlying activity. This paper presents a theoretical approach to synaptic connectivity accounting for the morphologies of pre- and postsynaptic neurons and providing the average number of synaptic contacts formed between them as a function of their relative locations. An important aspect is the decomposition of the complex structure of an axonal/dendritic arbor into a small number of basic structures. The theory is in very good agreement, within a wide range of cell separations, with empirical data on axonalâ€“dendritic contacts of pyramidal cells and somatic synapses formed by the axons of inhibitory interneurons. The current approach can provide a practical means for quantitatively deriving local synaptic circuits based on the actual observed densities of specific types of neurons and their morphologies.
