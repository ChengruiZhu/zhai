Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) is a disease involving multiple genes and systems. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) represent a class of non-coding small RNAs that post-transcriptionally suppress their target genes. The expression patterns of miRNA and messenger RNA (mRNA) in DVT remain poorly characterized. The aim of the present study was to evaluate miRNA and mRNA expression profiles in a stasis-induced DVT rat model. Male SD rats were randomly divided into three groups as follows: DVT, sham and control. The inferior vena cava (IVC) of rats was ligated to construct stasis-induced DVT models. Rats were sacrificed three days after ligation, and morphological changes in the vein tissues were observed by hematoxylin and eosin and Masson staining. The miRNA and mRNA expression profiles were evaluated by microarrays, followed by bioinformatics analysis. The microarray analysis identified 22 miRNAs and 487 mRNAs that were significantly differentially expressed between the experimental and control groups, and between the experimental and sham groups, but not between the control and sham groups (P≤0.05; ≥2.0-fold change). By subsequent bioinformatics analysis, a 19 miRNA-98 mRNAs network was constructed in the stasis-induced DVT rat model. Notably, the majority of these miRNAs and mRNAs are reported to be expressed by endothelial cells (ECs) and are associated with the function of ECs. The results provide evidence indicating that the regulatory association of miRNA and mRNA points to key roles played by ECs in thrombosis. These findings advance our understanding of the molecular regulatory mechanisms underlying the pathophysiology of DVT.
