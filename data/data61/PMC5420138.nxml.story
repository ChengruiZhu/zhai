Multiple myeloma (MM) is a clonal plasma-cell neoplastic disorder arising from an indolent premalignant disease known as monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS). MM is a biologically complex heterogeneous disease reflected by its variable clinical responses of patients receiving the same treatment. Therefore, a molecular identification of stage-specific biomarkers will support a more individualized precise diagnostic/prognostic approach, an effective therapeutic regime, and will assist in the identification of novel therapeutic molecular targets. The metastatic suppressor/anti-resistance factor Raf-1 kinase inhibitor protein (RKIP) is poorly expressed in the majority of cancers and is often almost absent in metastatic tumors. RKIP inhibits the Raf/MEK/ERK1/2 and the NF-ÎºB pathways. Whereby all tumors examined exhibited low levels of RKIP, in contrast, our recent findings demonstrated that RKIP is overexpressed primarily in its inactive phosphorylated form in MM cell lines and patient-derived tumor tissues. The underlying mechanism of RKIP overexpression in MM, in contrast to other tumors, is not known. We examined transcriptomic datasets on Oncomine platform (Life Technologies) for the co-expression of RKIP and other gene products in both pre-MM and MM. The transcription of several gene products was found to be either commonly overexpressed (i.e., RKIP, Bcl-2, and DR5) or underexpressed (i.e., Bcl-6 and TNFR2) in both pre-MM and MM. Noteworthy, a significant inverse correlation of differentially expressed pro-apoptotic genes was observed in pre-MM: overexpression of
