The process of light adaptation in blowfly photoreceptors was analyzed using intracellular recording techniques and double and triple flash stimuli. Adapting flashes of increasing intensity caused a progressive reduction in the excitability of the photoreceptors, which became temporarily suppressed when 3 x 10(6) quanta were absorbed by the cell. This suppression was confirmed by subsequently applying an intense test flash that photoactivated a considerable fraction of the 10(8) visual pigment molecules in the cell. The period of temporary desensitization is referred to as the refractory period. The stimulus intensity to render the receptor cell refractory was found to be independent of the extracellular calcium concentration over a range of 10(-4) and 10(-2) M. During the refractory period (30-40 ms after the adapting flash) the cell appears to be "protected" against further light adaptation since light absorption during this period did not affect the recovery of the cell's excitability. Calculations showed that the number of quantum absorptions necessary to induce receptor refractoriness is just sufficient to photoactivate every microvillus of the rhabdomere. This coincidence led to the hypothesis that the refractoriness of the receptor cells is due to the refractoriness of the individual microvilli. The sensitivity of the receptor cells after relatively weak adapting flashes was reduced considerably more than could be accounted for by the microvilli becoming refractory. A quantitative analysis of these results suggests that a photoactivated microvillus induces a local adaptation over a relatively small area of the rhabdomere around it, which includes several tens of microvilli. After light adaptation with an intense flash, photoactivation of every microvillus by the absorption of a few quanta produced only a small receptor response whereas photoactivation of every rhodopsin molecule in every microvillus produced the maximum response. The excitatory efficiency of the microvilli therefore increases with the number of quanta that are absorbed simultaneously.
