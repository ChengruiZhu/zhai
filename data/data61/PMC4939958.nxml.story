Posttranslational modifiers (PTMs) orchestrate the proteins and processes that control genome stability and cell growth. Accordingly, deregulation of PTMs causes disease, but can also be harnessed therapeutically. Crosstalk between PTMs is widespread, and acts to increase specificity and selectivity in signal transduction. Such crosstalk exists between two major PTMs, SUMO and ubiquitin, wherein a SUMO-targeted ubiquitin ligase (STUbL) can additionally mark SUMO-modified proteins with ubiquitin. Thereby, STUbL generates a hybrid SUMO-ubiquitin signal that is recognized by selective effectors, which can extract proteins from complexes and/or direct their degradation at the proteasome. STUbL function is critical to maintain genome stability, and it also mediates the therapeutic effects of arsenic trioxide in leukemia treatment. Therefore, a full appreciation of STUbL regulation and integration with other PTMs is warranted. Unexpectedly, we find that reduced activity of PP2A, a major cellular phosphatase, compensates for STUbL inactivation. Our results indicate that PP2A-regulated phosphorylation reduces the SUMO chain output of the SUMO pathway, thus reducing cellular dependency on STUbL and the functionally related factors Ulp2 and Rad60. Our data not only reveal a striking level of plasticity in signaling through certain PTMs, but also highlight potential "escape" mechanisms for SUMO pathway-based therapies.
