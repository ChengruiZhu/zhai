There has been great interest in the neurobiological substrate of the different dimensions of schizophrenia. This has largely focused on structural and functional changes while it has been acknowledged that there is a relation between pharmacological response and neurotransmitter alteration on these dimensions. Atypical anti psychotics which affect both positive and negative symptoms mediate their action predominantly through dopaminergic and serotonergic receptors. The current study extends this further looking at CSF amines. 37 drug naive first episode psychosis patients with the duration of illness less than 2 years were included. Patients were assessed with SAPS (Scale for Assessment of Positive Symptoms) and SANS (Scale for Assessment of Negative Symptoms). Lumbar puncture was done under sterile conditions and CSF was analyzed by HPLC for dopamine, serotonin and their metabolites. Mean CSF 5- HIAA was 25.35ng/dl. Mean CSF 5 HT was 7.72 ng/dl. Mean CSFHVA was 36.99 ng/dl. Mean CSF 5-DA was 3.06 ng/dl. There was significant positive correlation between CSF5-HIAA and Negative and Disorganization dimensions. There was significant negative correlation between CSF HVA and Psychosis dimension. There is evidence to support that the implication of serotonin in Negative and Disorganization dimensions and the Serotonin- Dopamine interaction and dimensions of schizophrenia.
