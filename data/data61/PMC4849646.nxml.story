Synucleinopathies are neurodegenerative diseases characterized by the abnormal accumulation of a neuronal protein called alpha-Synuclein (aSyn). The normal function of this protein in the cell remains unclear, but plays a role in synaptic function and plasticity, cell differentiation and vesicular trafficking. During disease, aSyn is believed to establish aberrant protein-protein interactions, culminating with its accumulation and aggregation and the concomitant disruption of several cellular pathways. Therefore therapeutics aimed at preventing or reversing aSyn accumulation could have potential disease-modifying effects. Here, our aim was to investigate the molecular mechanisms underlying the initial steps that lead to aSyn accumulation. For this, we performed a gene silencing screen to identify novel genetic modifiers of aSyn accumulation. We identified four genetic modifiers of aSyn, including genes involved in intracellular transport and in signal transduction pathways. In the future, the biological contextualization of the early events underlying aSyn pathology, using the modifiers identified in our study, will guide us to a deeper understanding of the role of aSyn in health and disease. In conclusion, our study constitutes a significant step forward towards the understanding of the molecular mechanisms underpinning aSyn accumulation, paving the way towards the development of novel therapeutic strategies for synucleinopathies.
