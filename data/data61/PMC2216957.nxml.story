Acetylcholine-evoked currents mediated by activation of nicotinic receptors in rat parasympathetic neurons were examined using whole-cell voltage clamp. The relative permeability of the neuronal nicotinic acetylcholine (nACh) receptor channel to monovalent and divalent inorganic and organic cations was determined from reversal potential measurements. The channel exhibited weak selectivity among the alkali metals with a selectivity sequence of Cs+ > K+ > Rb+ > Na+ > Li+, and permeability ratios relative to Na+ (Px/PNa) ranging from 1.27 to 0.75. The selectivity of the alkaline earths was also weak, with the sequence of Mg2+ > Sr2+ > Ba2+ > Ca2+, and relative permeabilities of 1.10 to 0.65. The relative Ca2+ permeability (PCa/PNa) of the neuronal nACh receptor channel is approximately fivefold higher than that of the motor endplate channel (Adams, D. J., T. M. Dwyer, and B. Hille. 1980. Journal of General Physiology. 75:493-510). The transition metal cation, Mn2+ was permeant (Px/PNa = 0.67), whereas Ni2+, Zn2+, and Cd2+ blocked ACh-evoked currents with half-maximal inhibition (IC50) occurring at approximately 500 microM, 5 microM and 1 mM, respectively. In contrast to the muscle endplate AChR channel, that at least 56 organic cations which are permeable to (Dwyer et al., 1980), the majority of organic cations tested were found to completely inhibit ACh- evoked currents in rat parasympathetic neurons. Concentration-response curves for guanidinium, ethylammonium, diethanolammonium and arginine inhibition of ACh-evoked currents yielded IC50's of approximately 2.5- 6.0 mM. The organic cations, hydrazinium, methylammonium, ethanolammonium and Tris, were measureably permeant, and permeability ratios varied inversely with the molecular size of the cation. Modeling suggests that the pore has a minimum diameter of 7.6 A. Thus, there are substantial differences in ion permeation and block between the nACh receptor channels of mammalian parasympathetic neurons and amphibian skeletal muscle which represent functional consequences of differences in the primary structure of the subunits of the ACh receptor channel.
