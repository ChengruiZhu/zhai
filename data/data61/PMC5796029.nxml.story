The development of radiation countermeasures for acute radiation syndrome (ARS) has been underway for the past six decades, leading to the identification of multiple classes of radiation countermeasures. However, to date, only two growth factors (Neupogen and Neulasta) have been approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration (US FDA) for the mitigation of hematopoietic acute radiation syndrome (H-ARS). No radioprotector for ARS has been approved by the FDA yet. Gamma-tocotrienol (GT3) has been demonstrated to have radioprotective efficacy in murine as well as nonhuman primate (NHP) models. Currently, GT3 is under advanced development as a radioprotector that can be administered prior to radiation exposure. We are studying this agent for its safety profile and efficacy using the NHP model. In this study, we analyzed global metabolomic and lipidomic changes using ultra-performance liquid chromatography (UPLC) quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry (QTOF-MS) in serum samples of NHPs administered GT3. Our study, using 12 NHPs, demonstrates that alterations in metabolites manifest only 24 h after GT3 administration. Furthermore, metabolic changes are associated with transient increase in the bioavailability of antioxidants, including lactic acid and cholic acid and anti-inflammatory metabolites 3 deoxyvitamin D3, and docosahexaenoic acid. Taken together, our results show that the administration of GT3 to NHPs causes metabolic shifts that would provide an overall advantage to combat radiation injury. This initial assessment also highlights the utility of metabolomics and lipidomics to determine the underlying physiological mechanisms involved in the radioprotective efficacy of GT3.
