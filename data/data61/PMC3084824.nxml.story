S100A14 is an EF-hand containing calcium-binding protein of the S100 protein family that exerts its biological effects on different types of cells. However, exact extracellular roles of S100A14 have not been clarified yet. Here we investigated the effects of S100A14 on esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) cell lines. Results demonstrated that low doses of extracellular S100A14 stimulate cell proliferation and promote survival in KYSE180 cells through activating ERK1/2 MAPK and NF-κB signaling pathways. Immunoprecipitation assay showed that S100A14 binds to receptor for advanced glycation end products (RAGE) in KYSE180 cells. Inhibition of RAGE signaling by different approaches including siRNA for RAGE, overexpression of a dominant-negative RAGE construct or a RAGE antagonist peptide (AmphP) significantly blocked S100A14-induced effects, suggesting that S100A14 acts via RAGE ligation. Furthermore, mutation of the N-EF hand of S100A14 (E39A, E45A) virtually reduced 10 µg/ml S100A14-induced cell proliferation and ERK1/2 activation. However, high dose (80 µg/ml) of S100A14 causes apoptosis via the mitochondrial pathway with activation of caspase-3, caspase-9, and poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase. High dose S100A14 induces cell apoptosis is partially in a RAGE-dependent manner. This is the first study to demonstrate that S100A14 binds to RAGE and stimulates RAGE-dependent signaling cascades, promoting cell proliferation or triggering cell apoptosis at different doses.
